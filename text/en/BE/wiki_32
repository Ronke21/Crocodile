<text>Abbo or Abbon of Fleury (; ¬†‚Äì 13 November 1004), also known as Saint Abbo or Abbon, was a monk and abbot of Fleury Abbey in present-day Saint-Beno√Æt-sur-Loire near Orl√©ans, France.

==Life==
Abbo was born near Orl√©ans and brought up in the Benedictine abbey of Fleury. He was educated at Paris and Reims, devoting himself to philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. He spent two years (985‚Äì987) in England, mostly in the newly founded monastery of Ramsey in Huntingdonshire, assisting Archbishop Oswald of York in restoring the monastic system. He was also abbot and director of the school of this newly founded monastery from 986 to 987.

Abbo returned to Fleury in 988, where he was selected as its abbot after Abbot Oilbold&#x27;s death. Another monk who had secured the support of the King and the Bishop of Orl√©ans contested the choice and the matter assumed national importance. Gerbert of Aurillac later Pope Sylvester II, settled the matter in Abbo&#x27;s favor. The new abbot became active in contemporary politics: for example, he attended the Synod of Verzy, near Reims, at which Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims was tried for treason and deposed, to make way for Gerbert. Arnulf of Orl√©ans, with whom Abbo feuded over monastic reform from 988 until 994, also attended the conference.

In 996 King Robert II (Robert the Pious) sent him to Rome to ward off a threatened papal interdict over Robert&#x27;s marriage to Bertha of Burgundy. On the way to Rome he met Pope Gregory V, who was a fugitive from the city from which the Antipope John XVI had expelled him. Between the Pontiff and the Abbot the greatest esteem and affection existed. The royal petition for a dispensation was rejected. Abbo succeeded in bringing about the restoration of Arnulf to the see of Reims. He was influential in calming the excitement and fear about the end of the world which was widespread in Europe in 1000.

In 1004 he attempted to restore discipline in the monastery of La R√©ole, in Gascony, by transferring some of the monks of Fleury into that community. But the trouble increased; fighting began between the two parties and when Abbo endeavoured to separate them he was pierced in the side by a lance. He concealed the wound and reached his cell, where he died in the arms of his faithful disciple Aimoin, who has left an account of his labours and virtues. The miracles wrought at his tomb soon caused the Church of Gaul to regard him as a saint and martyr, although he does not seem to have been canonized by Rome officially. His feast is kept on 13 November.

==Works==
During his time in England, Abbo learned of the martyrdom of Edmund of East Anglia (November 870). In response, he wrote a passion in Latin about it. He also wrote a Latin grammar for his English students, and three poems to Dunstan. Among his other works are a simplification of the &quot;computus&quot;, the computation of the date of Easter; an &quot;Epitome de XCI Romanorum Pontificum Vitis&quot; (book on the lives of Roman popes, which is an abridgement of the earlier Liber Pontificalis), a &quot;Collectio Canonum&quot;, with clarifications about topics of Canon Law, and other treatises on controversial topics and letters. Around 980 to 985, he wrote a commentary on the &quot;Calculus&quot; of Victorius of Aquitaine, before the introduction of Arabic numerals, when calculations were often quite complex. The wide range of Abbo&#x27;s thought is reflected in the commentary, covering the nature of wisdom, the philosophy of numbers, the relationship of unity and plurality, and the arithmetic of the Calculus. Abbo drew on his knowledge of grammar, logic and cosmology to illustrate his arguments, and set it all in the broader context of his theology of Creation. Most of Abbo&#x27;s works can be found in the Patrologia Latina (CXXXIX, 375‚Äì582).

There is one contemporary biography, written by his disciple Aimoin, in which much of Abbo&#x27;s correspondence was reproduced. It is of great importance, including as a historical source of information about the reign of Robert II of France, especially with reference to the Papacy.

Richard W. Pfaff sums up Abbo&#x27;s achievements as follows: &quot;One of the most versatile thinkers and writers of his time, Abbo put his mark on several areas of medieval life and thought, but none more so than in transmitting much that was valuable from the tradition of reformed French monasticism to the nascent monastic culture of late tenth-century England.&quot;

Selleck&#x27;s first television appearance was as a college senior on &quot;The Dating Game&quot; in 1965 and again in 1967. Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as Pepsi-Cola.

He began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot; (invited on the set by Mae West), &quot;Coma&quot;, and &quot;The Seven Minutes&quot;. He appeared in a number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. He was also the face of Salem cigarettes and Revlon&#x27;s Chaz cologne. Selleck appeared in a commercial for Right Guard deodorant in 1971, with Farrah Fawcett in 1972 for the aperitif Dubonnet, and another in 1977 for the toothpaste Close-Up. He was also in a Safeguard deodorant soap commercial (1972). In 1972, he starred in the B-movie &quot;Daughters of Satan&quot;. He had a recurring role in the 1970s as private investigator Lance White in &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;.

Selleck is an avid outdoorsman, marksman and firearms collector. These interests led him to leading-man cowboy roles in Western films, starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal Orrin Sackett in the 1979 film &quot;The Sacketts&quot;, opposite Sam Elliott, Jeff Osterhage, and Western legends Glenn Ford and Ben Johnson, and that same year, &quot;Concrete Cowboys&quot; with Jerry Reed. &quot;The Shadow Riders&quot; followed in 1982. Then Selleck shifted gears, portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in &quot;Lassiter&quot; in 1984. &quot;Quigley Down Under&quot; is one of his best-known Western films, but it was for his 1997 role in &quot;Last Stand at Saber River&quot; that he won a &quot;Western Heritage Award&quot;.

===&quot;Magnum&quot; stardom===
Selleck&#x27;s big break came when he was cast in the lead role as Thomas Magnum in &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; The producers would not release the actor for other projects, so Selleck had to pass on the role of Indiana Jones in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, which meant that the role went to actor Harrison Ford instead. It turned out that the shooting of the pilot for &quot;Magnum&quot; was delayed for over six months by a writers&#x27; strike, which would have enabled him to complete &quot;Raiders&quot;.

Selleck played the role of Thomas Magnum in 1980 after filming six other TV pilots that were never sold. Magnum was a former U.S. Navy SEAL officer who had served in the Vietnam War; after the war, Magnum had been in the &quot;Naval Intelligence Agency&quot; (a fictional version of the Office of Naval Intelligence) and then resigned from the Navy to become a private investigator living in Hawaii. The show continued until 1988, lasting 8 seasons and 163 episodes, winning him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in 1984.

Selleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style aloha shirt and a Detroit Tigers baseball cap.

Magnum drove a Ferrari 308 GTS in the series. 

After the end of the show in 1988, it established itself as the top-rated one-hour show in the history of syndicated reruns (at least until 1998). 

In 1984, he introduced Nancy Reagan at the 1984 Republican National Convention.

Selleck was offered the lead role of Mitch Buchannon in &quot;Baywatch&quot; but he turned it down because he did not want to be seen as a sex symbol. The role eventually went to David Hasselhoff.

During the &quot;Magnum&quot; years, he also starred as an acrophobic police detective in &quot;Runaway&quot; and a stand-in father in &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, which was the biggest hit at the American box office in 1987. In 1989, he ended the decade by starring in the romantic comedy &quot;Her Alibi&quot; and crime drama &quot;An Innocent Man&quot;.

===TV and advertising===

In 1990, he starred as an American 19th-century sharpshooter in the Australian Western &quot;Quigley Down Under&quot;, a role and film that he considers one of his best. During the 1990s, he also starred in &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot;, &quot;Folks!&quot;, &quot;Christopher Columbus: The Discovery&quot;, &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot;, &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; and &quot;The Love Letter&quot;. Selleck&#x27;s role in &quot;In &amp; Out&quot; is his first as a gay character (Peter Malloy).

In the mid-1990s, Selleck played the role of Richard Burke, Monica Geller&#x27;s older boyfriend, beginning at the end of the second season of the TV series &quot;Friends&quot;. Richard was a divorced ophthalmologist who was a friend of Monica&#x27;s parents. At first, the relationship was hidden from her parents. The relationship eventually ended over Richard&#x27;s reluctance to commit to having children, though Selleck did make a few more appearances in later episodes. His decision to star in a six-episode plot of &quot;Friends&quot; was seen as a digression from the movies back to TV shows and a mistake by his career advisers. Selleck recruited a new agent and accepted the part. This role earned him an Emmy Award nomination in 2000 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.

He did the voice-over for the 1993 AT&amp;T advertising campaigns titled &quot;You Will.&quot; These advertisements had a futuristic feel, and posed the question of, &quot;What if you had the technology to _____? Well, you will ... and the company that will bring it to you? AT&amp;T.&quot;

In the mid-1990s, Selleck hosted a special series on TLC called &quot;The Practical Guide to the Universe&quot;, in which he talked about the stars, planets, galaxies, etc.

In February 1998, he accepted the lead role in a sitcom for CBS called &quot;The Closer&quot;. This role was his big comeback on prime-time TV. In it, he played Jack McLaren, a legendary publicist heading up a brand-new marketing firm. His costars included Ed Asner, David Krumholtz, and Penelope Ann Miller. Despite the high pedigree, and the expectations for Selleck&#x27;s first series since &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, low ratings caused the show to be canceled after ten episodes.

His last two cowboy roles to date were in the 2001 TNT movie &quot;Crossfire Trail&quot; (based on a Louis L&#x27;Amour novel of the same name), and the 2003 motion picture &quot;Monte Walsh&quot;. In 2001, Selleck played the lead role of Murray in a Broadway revival of Herb Gardner&#x27;s comedic play &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;. The production toured for four months, playing in North Carolina, Chicago and Boston before opening on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre. Critics, though far from uniformly negative about Selleck&#x27;s performance, generally compared it unfavorably to that of Jason Robards, who won awards in the 1960s for playing the character on the stage and in a movie version. The production closed as a result of the attacks on 9/11.

Selleck played the role of General Dwight D. Eisenhower in A&amp;E&#x27;s 2004 made-for-TV movie &quot;&quot;. The movie showed the planning, politics, and preparation for the 1944 Invasion of Normandy, and Selleck was critically lauded for playing a cool, calm Eisenhower.
Selleck played the role of Mr. Kornfeldt in the movie Killers in 2010.

Since 2005, Selleck has starred in the role of transplanted lawman Jesse Stone in a series of made-for-TV movies based on Robert B. Parker&#x27;s novels. To date, the series comprises nine films, with the most recent released in October 2015. In addition to his portrayal of the films&#x27; protagonist, Selleck now acts as producer for the series. The fifth film, &quot;Jesse Stone: Thin Ice&quot;, was not adapted from Parker&#x27;s novels, but was instead an original story by Selleck.

He joined the cast of the NBC drama &quot;Las Vegas&quot; in the season-five premiere on September 28, 2007. He played A. J. Cooper, the new owner of the Montecito Casino. He replaced James Caan, who left the cast in the same episode. This was Selleck&#x27;s first regular role in a drama show since he played Thomas Magnum in &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; As of December 30, 2007, he began doing commercial voice-overs for Florida&#x27;s Natural orange juice.

Since 2010, he has starred as Frank Reagan in the CBS American police procedural/drama series &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;, filmed on location in New York City. Frank Reagan is the Police Commissioner, and the series follows the Reagan family of law enforcement officers with the New York City Police Department and the Manhattan district attorney&#x27;s office. The show premiered on September 24, 2010, and is in its final season as of 2024.

In 2012, Selleck was featured in Coldwell Banker&#x27;s television ad campaign focusing on homeownership. Starting in 2016 he has been the pitchman for reverse-mortgage lender American Advisors Group (AAG).

Selleck appeared in a recurring role on the acclaimed ABC drama &quot;Boston Legal&quot; as Ivan Tiggs, the troubled ex-husband of Shirley Schmidt (Candice Bergen).

In 2021, Selleck made his album debut singing &quot;Yessir, That&#x27;s My Baby&quot; with Nicolas King (recorded live in 2001 during their run of &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;) on King&#x27;s album &quot;Act One&quot; released by Club44 Records.

==Personal life==

From 1971 to 1982, Selleck was married to model Jacqueline Ray. During that time, he adopted her son, Kevin Shepard (born 1966), who would go on to be the drummer for the American rock band Tonic. On August 7, 1987, Selleck married Jillie Joan Mack (born 1957), whom he met in Britain. They have one daughter, Hannah (born December 16, 1988).

Selleck has said he is Episcopalian, and got instruction from &quot;Blue Bloods&quot; co-star Bridget Moynahan on how to properly cross himself when playing his Catholic character Frank Reagan.

Selleck and his family live near Thousand Oaks-Westlake Village, California, on a avocado ranch in Hidden Valley formerly owned by Dean Martin. In a 2012 interview with &quot;People&quot;, Selleck talked about living and working on his ranch: &quot;So I like to get outside and work on the ranch, from fixing roads to clearing brush. I hate going to the gym, so sweating outdoors sure beats sitting on a stationary bike staring at my navel. And I work cheaper than anyone I could hire to do it.&quot;

He has said that he doesn&#x27;t personally use text messages or e-mail.

Selleck is an accomplished indoor and beach volleyball player, playing the outside hitter position for the Outrigger Canoe Club, Honolulu. (Son Kevin attended Selleck&#x27;s alma mater, USC, and became a volleyball team All-American in 1990.) Outrigger Canoe Club teammate Dennis Berg, in the summer 2011 issue of &quot;Volleyball USA&quot; magazine, said of Selleck, &quot;Tom was a great teammate, appreciative of being included with such a talented and experienced group, practicing and playing hard when his &quot;Magnum&quot; schedule permitted... He was very patient with all of us, and we relished the big crowds that replaced the usual sparse number of players&#x27; friends and spouses at the national tourney matches.&quot;

Selleck is an avid ice hockey fan and has been seen attending Los Angeles Kings games at Staples Center. He lists An≈æe Kopitar and Alexander Frolov as two of his favorite players. He was once a minority owner of the Detroit Tigers, his favorite baseball team since childhood. In 1986, Selleck hit a batting practice home run while working out with the Tigers. In preparation for his role in the film &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot;, Selleck reached out to the Tigers to practice with them during the spring of 1991. He took batting practice for three weeks, even making an appearance in an exhibition game against Cincinnati, where Tiger manager Sparky Anderson put him into a game as a pinch-hitter. He managed to foul off 3 pitches from Reds pitcher Tim Layana before striking out. Selleck believes his training helped him considerably in his film role, having gained valuable experience from attending team meetings and developing an understanding of how competitive players function together.

One of Selleck&#x27;s &quot;Magnum&quot; co-stars, Larry Manetti, in his 1996 memoir &quot;Aloha Magnum&quot;, was lavish in his praise of Selleck. Manetti lauded Selleck for his extraordinary work ethic on a grueling show (shooting for hours in the midday Hawaiian sun), Selleck&#x27;s work with Hawaiian charities, and his willingness to support the program&#x27;s cast and crew members. 

In February 2009, Selleck joined the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund as national spokesman for the new Education Center being built on the National Mall.

Upon James Garner&#x27;s death in 2014, he said, &quot;Jim was a mentor to me and a friend, and I will miss him.&quot; Two years after Garner&#x27;s death, Selleck said, prior to filming his then 6th season of &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s kind of like my mentor, who never wanted to hear he was my mentor [James Garner], I don&#x27;t accept the mentor role. That they feel that way is, I think flattering although it adds a certain amount of pressure.&quot;

===2015 water lawsuit===
Selleck was sued by the Calleguas Municipal Water District for allegedly improperly transferring approximately 1.4¬†million gallons of water from the Calleguas Municipal Water District to the Hidden Valley Municipal Water District during the driest California drought since record-keeping began, which he used to water his avocado farm. He settled the suit by paying $21,685.55 to the Calleguas Municipal Water District, an amount which represented the district&#x27;s private investigator fees in connection with the case.

==Political views==

Selleck has been a member of the board of directors of the National Rifle Association and served as a spokesman for the organization. He resigned from the board on September 18, 2018, though he remained a member of the organization. After his close friend Charlton Heston stepped down from his role as an NRA spokesman in 2003, Selleck succeeded him. In 2002, Selleck donated the rifle he used in &quot;Quigley Down Under&quot; (a custom 13-pound [6¬†kg], single-shot, 1874 Sharps Rifle, with a 34-inch [86-cm] barrel), along with six other firearms from his other films, to the NRA. The firearms are part of the NRA&#x27;s exhibit &quot;Real Guns of Reel Heroes&quot; at the National Firearms Museum in Fairfax, Virginia.

To promote his film &quot;The Love Letter&quot;, Selleck was invited to be on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; on May 19, 1999. During the appearance, O&#x27;Donnell questioned Selleck about his support of gun ownership and an ad in which he appeared supporting the NRA. At the end of the interview, Selleck stated, &quot;It&#x27;s your show and you can talk about it after I leave.&quot; Selleck later confided to Shaun Robinson: &quot;I still like Rosie. I think she needs to take a deep breath and stop thinking everybody who disagrees with her is evil.&quot;

For a number of years, Selleck appeared in television advertising for &quot;National Review&quot;. He also subscribes to &quot;The New Republic&quot;. Selleck describes himself as &quot;a registered independent with a lot of libertarian leanings&quot;.

In the 2016 presidential election, Selleck did not support either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, instead writing in former Dallas Police Department Chief David Brown, saying that he was deeply touched by the grace and leadership Brown showed through the 2016 Dallas police shooting.

&quot;Blue Bloods&quot; co-star Abigail Hawk said Selleck often keeps his opinions to himself, but tries to form his views by reading news sources from across the opinion spectrum and likes to focus on the facts of a situation. &quot;He always took the most left-wing news source, and then a right-wing news source, and read them both, researched the entire spectrum, and then made his decision based on all of that information,&quot; Hawk said.

== Filmography ==
==Awards and honors==

On April 28, 2000, Selleck received an honorary doctorate degree from Pepperdine University. He was chosen because of his outstanding character and ethic. He is a board member of the non-profit Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute of Ethics and co-founder of the Character Counts Coalition. He received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1986. The star is situated at 6925 Hollywood Blvd. In 1989, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

<doc id="277453" wikidata="Q758659" url="?curid=277453" title="Auckland University of Technology">
<text>Auckland University of Technology ( AUT; ) is a university in New Zealand, formed on 1 January 2000 when a former technical college (originally established in 1895) was granted university status. AUT is New Zealand&#x27;s third largest university in terms of total student enrolment, with approximately 29,100 students enrolled across three campuses in Auckland. It has five faculties, and an additional two specialist locations: AUT Millennium and AUT Centre for Refugee Education.

AUT enrolled more than 29,000 students in 2018, including 4,194 international students from 94 countries and 2,417 postgraduate students. Students also represent a wide age range with 22% being aged 25‚Äì39 years and 10% being 40 or older.

AUT employed 2,474 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff in 2016, including both professional and academic.

==History==
Historically New Zealand lacked technical training institutions even after the establishment of free and compulsory education in 1877 many calls were made for the education system to incorporate technical training. In response Robert Stout, the Minister of Education in 1885, tried to compel universities and secondary schools to establish technical education. This fell on deaf ears so instead he gave land to the Wellington Board of Education to establish a school. In 1886 the Wellington School of Design was opened. Later in 1895 the Auckland Technical School opened as an evening school. In 1913 the organisation became the Seddon Memorial Technical College, after Richard Seddon, the longest serving New Zealand premier.

In the early 1960s educational reforms resulted in the separation of secondary and tertiary teaching; two educational establishments were formed; the tertiary (polytechnic) adopting the name Auckland Technical Institute (ATI) in 1963 and the secondary school continuing with the same name. For three years they co-existed on the same site, but by 1964 the secondary school had moved to a new site in Western Springs and eventually became Western Springs College. In 1989 ATI became Auckland Institute of Technology (AIT), and the current name was adopted when university status was granted in 2000.

Sir Paul Reeves served as university chancellor from 2005 until his death in 2011.

==Campuses and facilities==
AUT has three campuses: City (in Auckland CBD), North and South, and the training institute, Millennium. City and North campuses offer student accommodation. AUT runs a shuttle bus service between the city and south campus.

===City campus===

City Campus spreads over several sites in the heart of central Auckland. The largest site is situated on Wellesley Street East and is home to most of the academic units and central administration, including the Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s Office and research centres. The Faculties of Business, Economics and Law, Design and Creative Technologies, Culture and Society and Te Ara Poutama share this location.

Facilities of the campus include an early childhood centre, International Student Centre, printing centre, gym, Chinese Centre, Pasifika Student Support Service, Postgraduate Centre and Te Tari ƒÄwhina Learning Development Centre. The Central Library holds over 245,000 books and journals on four floors. There are cafes, restaurants and bars, including the student-owned Vesbar. Training restaurants Piko Restaurant and Four Seasons Restaurant have operated commercially since 2011. There is also a marae, the AUT Shop, St Paul St Art Gallery, a university bookshop, and the Wellesley student apartments.

AUT has recently completed a number of buildings, including the new WZ building designed to house the engineering, computer science and mathematics students under one roof. The first 8 levels of the 12-storey $120 million building opened in July 2018 to coincide with the start of the second academic semester. The building itself was designed to be a teaching tool, with structural components visible, ceilings left exposed for viewing and the building management systems being visible on screens for analysis by students. Sustainability was also a goal, with rain water being collected for use in the labs, occupancy sensors in the rooms to ensure that areas are not being unnecessarily lit and solar fins on the outside of the building to regulate heat from the sun and ease load on the air-conditioning system.

Another recent building completion is the $98 million WG precinct. Named after the former Chancellor of the university, the Sir Paul Reeves Building hosts the School of Communication Studies. The 12-storey building was officially opened by Prime Minister John Key on 22 March 2013. It provides an additional learning space of about 20,000 square metres that consists of convention spaces, screen and television studios and a motion capture, sound and performance studio.

The most recent addition to the city campus is the WQ building (Formally known as Te ƒÄhuru Student Accommodation and Recreation Centre). This building serves as the home to 697 students in the student accommodation part of the building operated by UniLodge. The rest of the building is occupied by the AUT Recreation centre which has a multipurpose court, breakout rooms, dance studios as well as staff offices. The student accommodation opened its doors in February 2021 and the Recreation Centre followed shortly later with it being officially opened by MP Chl√∂e Swarbrick on 22 July 2021.

===South campus===

AUT opened South Campus (formerly Manukau Campus) in 2010, creating the first university campus based in the region. It offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in business, computer and information sciences, education, health sciences, year 1 of law, as well as sports management and science. South Campus hosts its own library, student lounges, student information centre, course information centre, computer labs, wireless network, and caf√©. The campus also boasts astro turf courts with tennis, basketball, netball, volleyball, touch, and soccer equipment available for hire.

In 2016, the university invested significantly in the construction of the Mana Hauora (MH) Building. Construction of MH was completed in December 2016, and was officially opened by Prime Minister Bill English in March 2017. As the largest building on campus, MH is now the new heart of the campus and incorporates a number of sustainability design features. In 2017, three awards were given in recognition of the new MH Building at the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) Auckland Regional Awards.
===North campus===
North Campus is located on Akoranga Drive in Northcote. The Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences (including the Sport and Recreation division) and School of Education share this campus, which has park-like grounds. AUT&#x27;s main sport and fitness centre is located at the campus, encompassing a gymnasium, weights room, testing equipment, golf swing clinic, and indoor courts. The campus also offers a library, student services centre, early childhood centre, AuSM branch, PrintSprint shop, health counselling and wellbeing centre, university bookshop, and food outlets. In addition, the campus provides five health clinics (oral, physiotherapy, podiatry, psychotherapy, and ultrasound), which are now located at the NorthMed Health Clinic building at 3 Akoranga Drive, Northcote (since July 2017). North Campus is closely linked with the nearby AUT Millennium Institute of Sport and Health.

===AUT Millennium===
Like AUT North Campus, the Millennium Institute is located on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore, at Mairangi Bay. AUT Millennium provides sports training, and hosts national and local sports organisations, including Swimming New Zealand, New Zealand Water Polo, Northsport Olympic Weightlifting, and Sport and Recreation New Zealand. The institute has training facilities, athlete accommodation, sports science laboratories, an aquatics facility, and a commercial gym.

===Warkworth Radio Astronomical Observatory===
AUT maintains a number of facilities off campus, which until 2023, included the AUT Radio Telescope, New Zealand&#x27;s first radio telescope. The 12m telescope is located near Warkworth and is part of New Zealand&#x27;s and Australia&#x27;s involvement in the international mega-science project, the Square Kilometre Array. The AUT/New Zealand Alliance won the &#x27;Highly Commended&#x27; award in the Innovation Excellence in Research category at the 2016 New Zealand Innovation Awards.

=== AUT Centre for Refugee Education ===
AUT&#x27;s Centre for Refugee Education, located in MƒÅngere, provides an on-arrival six-week education programme for the 1,000 refugees who come to New Zealand each year under the government quota scheme. The education programme teaches English language skills at early childhood, primary, secondary and adult levels, as well as orientation to life in New Zealand. With a new set of learners arriving every two months, and with ages ranging from early childhood to adult, the teaching team has developed a curriculum that gives refugees English and life skills, but remains flexible in order to tailor the lessons to each new intake.

In 2016, AUT&#x27;s quality-assured research outputs increased by 9% to more than 2000 outputs, including publication in leading international journals.
==== New Zealand Tourism Research Institute ====
Disestablished in 2023

The New Zealand Tourism Research Institute (NZTRI), brings together local and international experts in tourism and hospitality. It was established in 1999 by Professor Simon Milne, and is located in the School of Hospitality and Tourism. In 2010 the institute brought together 19 researchers as well as 15 PhD students, several other graduate students being linked to the Institute in more informal ways.

NZTRI conducts research projects around the world and has developed strong links with Hu·∫ø University in Vietnam, Wageningen University in the Netherlands, University of Akureyri in Iceland, McGill University and York University in Canada among others. Its research programme areas include coastal and marine tourism, community development, cultural heritage tourism, event tourism, health and wellness tourism, hospitality research, indigenous tourism, Pacific Islands tourism, tourism marketing, and tourism technology. The institute has a team of research officers, international interns and other allied staff.

==== Pacific Media Centre ====
The Pacific Media Centre (PMC) is located within the School of Communication Studies. It was founded in 2007 to develop media and journalism research in New Zealand, particularly involving MƒÅori, Pacific Islands, ethnic and vernacular media topics. It is recognised as a diversity project by the Human Rights Commission (New Zealand), and has been featured by the Panos London Media Development programme for its development communication work.

The centre publishes Asia-Pacific journalism, and has published Pacific Scoop since 2009. It also publishes media and communication studies books, like the 2009 book &quot;Communication, Culture and Society in Papua New Guinea: Yo Tok Wanem?&quot;, in collaboration with other publishers or overseas universities. The centre was featured as a Creative Commons case study in 2010. Founding director David Robie, a New Zealand author, journalist and media academic, won a Vice Chancellor&#x27;s Award in 2011 for excellence in university teaching.

Pacific Media Watch is PMC&#x27;s daily independent Asia-Pacific media monitoring service and research project. The site was launched in Sydney in October 1996, and has links with the University of the South Pacific, the University of PNG (UPNG) and the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism (ACIJ). Since moving to AUT in 2007, it has become a digital repository and received a grant from the Pacific Development and Conservation Trust in 2010 to &quot;expand its educational and research role for the Pacific region&quot;. PMW has established a Pactok server archive, and added a D-Space archive in 2010. Representatives of Pacific Media Watch report on the region&#x27;s news developments, provide advocacy for media freedom, and published a media freedom report on the South Pacific in 2011.

PMC has also published &quot;Pacific Journalism Review&quot;, a peer-reviewed research journal on media issues and communication in the South Pacific and Australia, since 2002. The journal was previously published at the University of Papua New Guinea from 1994 to 1999. The editorial policy focuses on the cultural politics of the media, including new media and social movements, the culture of indigenous peoples, the politics of tourism and development, the role of the media and the formation of national identity. It also covers environmental and development studies in the media and communication, and vernacular media in the region. In October 2010, PJR was awarded the &quot;Creative Stimulus Award&quot; for academic journals in the inaugural Academy Awards of the Global Creative Industries in Beijing, China. The journal has advocated free speech and freedom of information in the Asia-Pacific region.

AUTSA (AUT Students&#x27; Association) is the students&#x27; association at AUT. Every student attending a course run by AUT is a member of AUTSA, and its primary function is to promote and maintain the rights and welfare of students. It provides advocacy and support, assignment binding, student diary and wall planner, Student Job Search, food vouchers, and food bank. The AUTSA Advocacy Team provide advice to students with academic grievances, grade appeals, harassment, or tenancy issues.

The AUTSA Student Representative Council (SRC) is composed of a president, a vice president, and MƒÅori Affairs, Pasifika, Diversity, International, Disability and Postgraduate Officers. There are Business and Law, Design and Creative Technologies, Health and Environmental Sciences, Culture and Society and Te Ara Poutama Faculty Representatives. There are also City Campus, North Campus and South Campus Representatives. AUTSA representatives sit on various committees, focus groups and boards to speak out on behalf of 24,000 AUTSA members. Former presidents include April Pokino (2014‚Äì2015), Kizito Essuman (2012‚Äì2013), Veronica Ng Lam (2010‚Äì2011), Andre D&#x27;cruz (2009), and Jan Herman (2007‚Äì2008).

<text>The University of Auckland (; MƒÅori: &quot;Waipapa Taumata Rau&quot;) is a public research university based in Auckland, New Zealand. The institution was established in 1883 as a constituent college of the University of New Zealand. Initially located in a repurposed courthouse, the university has grown substantially over the years. As of 2024, it stands as the largest university in New Zealand by enrolment, teaching approximately 43,000 students across three major campuses in central Auckland.

The university conducts teaching and learning within six faculties, two research institutes, and other institutes and centres. The City Campus, in the Auckland central business district, hosts the majority of students and faculties. 

== History ==
===Origins===
The University of Auckland began as a constituent college of the University of New Zealand, founded on 23 May 1883 as &quot;Auckland University College&quot;. Stewardship of the university during its establishment period was the responsibility of John Chapman Andrew (Vice Chancellor of the University of New Zealand 1885‚Äì1903). Housed in a disused courthouse and jail, it started out with 95 students and 4 teaching staff: Frederick Douglas Brown, professor of chemistry (London and Oxford); Algernon Phillips Withiel Thomas, professor of natural sciences (Oxford); Thomas George Tucker, professor of classics (Cambridge); and William Steadman Aldis, professor of mathematics (Cambridge). By 1901, student numbers had risen to 156; the majority of these students were training towards being law clerks or teachers and were enrolled part-time. 

===Development of a research culture===
The university conducted little research until the 1930s, when there was a spike in interest in academic research during the Great Depression. At this point, the college&#x27;s executive council issued several resolutions in favour of academic freedom after the controversial dismissal of John Beaglehole (allegedly for a letter to a newspaper where he publicly defended the right of communists to distribute their literature), which helped encourage the college&#x27;s growth.

In 1934, four new professors joined the college: Arthur Sewell (English), H.G. Forder (Mathematics), C.G. Cooper (Classics) and James Rutherford (History). The combination of new talent, and academic freedom saw Auckland University College flourish through to the 1950s.

In 1950, the Elam School of Fine Arts was brought into the University of Auckland. Archie Fisher, who had been appointed principal of the Elam School of Fine Arts was instrumental in having it brought in the University of Auckland.

===Making a name===

The University of New Zealand was dissolved in 1961 and the University of Auckland was empowered by the University of Auckland Act 1961.

In 1966, lecturers Keith Sinclair and Bob Chapman established The University of Auckland Art Collection, beginning with the purchase of several paintings and drawings by Colin McCahon. The Collection is now managed by the Centre for Art Research, based at the Gus Fisher Gallery. Stage A of the Science building was opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 3 May. In 1975‚Äì81 Marie Clay and Patricia Bergquist, the first two female professors, were appointed.

===Growth and consolidation===

Queen Elizabeth II opened the new School of Medicine Building at Grafton on 24 March 1970. The Queen also opened the Liggins Institute in 2002.

The North Shore Campus, established in 2001, was located in the suburb of Takapuna. It offered the Bachelor of Business and Information Management degree. The faculty was served by its own library. At the end of 2006, the campus was closed, and the degree relocated to the City campus.

On 1 September 2004, the Auckland College of Education merged with the university&#x27;s School of Education (previously part of the Arts Faculty) to form the Faculty of Education and Social Work. The faculty was based at the Epsom Campus of the former college, with an additional campus in WhangƒÅrei.

Professor Stuart McCutcheon became vice-chancellor on 1 January 2005. He was previously the vice-chancellor of Victoria University of Wellington. He succeeded Dr John Hood (PhD, Hon. LLD), who was appointed vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford. On 16 March 2020, McCutcheon was succeeded by Professor Dawn Freshwater, the first female vice-chancellor in the university&#x27;s history.

The university opened a new business school in 2007, following the completion of the Information Commons. It has recently gained international accreditations for all its programmes and now completes the &quot;Triple Crown&quot; (AMBA, EQUIS and AACSB).

In 2009, the university embarked on a NZ$1 billion 10-year plan to redevelop and expand its facilities. The $240 million Grafton Campus upgrade was completed in 2011. In May 2013 the university purchased a site for new 5.2-hectare campus on a former Lion Breweries site adjacent to the major business area in Newmarket. The Faculty of Engineering and the School of Chemical Sciences moved into the new faculties in 2015. The NZ$200 million new Science Centre was opened in July 2017. The NZ$280 million new Engineering Building was completed in 2019. In 2017, work started on the building of a new $116m medical school building in Grafton Campus. In 2019, work began on the redevelopment of the University Recreation Centre in the City Campus. The new recreation centre, Hiwa, opened in 2024. The University of Auckland has also built multiple student accommodation buildings, and it became the largest provider of student accommodation in New Zealand.

== Organisation and administration ==

=== Governance ===
The head of the university is the chancellor, currently Cecilia Tarrant. However, this position is only titular. The chief executive of the university is the vice-chancellor, currently Professor Dawn Freshwater, who is the university&#x27;s sixth vice-chancellor, and the first woman to hold the role.

==== List of chancellors ====
Since 1957, when Auckland University College became the University of Auckland, the university has had 13 chancellors. Previously, the college council had been headed by a president (from 1923), or a chairman (1883‚Äì1923).

=== Faculties and schools ===
The university is made up of a number of faculties and schools.

==Campuses and facilities==

===Campuses===

The University of Auckland has a number of campuses in Auckland, and one in WhangƒÅrei in the Northland Region.

From the start of the first semester of 2010, the university banned smoking on any of its property, including inside and outside buildings in areas that were once designated as smoking areas.
==== City Campus ====
The City Campus in the Auckland CBD has the majority of the students and faculties. It covers 16 hectares and has a range of amenities including cafes, health services, libraries, childcare facilities and a recreation centre.

==== Grafton Campus ====

The Grafton Campus, established in 1968, is opposite Auckland City Hospital in the suburb of Grafton, close to the City Campus. The Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences is based here, along with the Eye Clinic.

==== Newmarket Campus ====
The Newmarket Campus was acquired from Lion, when operations ceased at its Newmarket brewery in 2010, selling the site to the university in May 2013. The university has built an engineering research space and a civil structures hall. This new campus houses the Faculties of Engineering and Science.

==== Other campuses and facilities ====

*The Tai Tokerau Campus in WhangƒÅrei offers teacher education courses to the Northland community.
*The Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences also has several satellite campuses and research facilities including the Waitemata Health Campus (which services North Shore Hospital and Waitakere Hospital), the Freemasons&#x27; Department of Geriatric Medicine at North Shore Hospital, the South Auckland Clinical Campus at Middlemore Hospital, and the Waikato Clinical School.
*The Leigh Marine Laboratory is effectively the marine campus and hosts postgraduate teaching and research at the Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine Reserve (Goat Island) near Warkworth. Situated on the east coast, about 100¬†km north of the city of Auckland, it has access to a wide range of unspoiled marine habitats.
*The South Auckland Campus ‚Äì Te Papa Ako o Tai Tonga opened in February 2020 in Manukau, and replaced the Faculty of Education courses that were offered at Manukau Institute of Technology (MIT) prior to the opening of the campus.
*Goldie Estate ‚Äì Wine Science Centre. In July 2011 Kim and Jeanette Goldwater gifted a 14-hectare winery in Waiheke Island to the university. The Wine Science Centre currently hosts the university&#x27;s Wine Science courses.

==== Former campuses ====
The TƒÅmaki Innovations Campus was located in the east Auckland suburb of St Johns. It was a predominantly postgraduate campus offering training and research security in health innovation and &quot;biodiversity and biosecurity innovation.&quot; The Tamaki campus was closed down in 2020 and its former programs were relocated to the city, Grafton, and Newmarket campuses.

The Epsom Campus, located in Epsom, Auckland, was the main teacher training campus, offering programmes in teacher education and social services. It had been the Auckland College of Education&#x27;s main campus, until the college merged with the university&#x27;s School of Education in September 2004 to form the Faculty of Education and Social Work. There were plans to close down the Epsom Campus in 2020 and relocate the Faculty of Education and Social Work to the City Campus. Later, the closure of the Epsom Campus was postponed to late 2023, with teaching resuming at the City Campus&#x27;s refurbished Building 201 in early 2024. 

===Overseas campuses and facilities===

==== The University of Auckland Innovation Institute China (UOAIIC) ====
UOAIIC was established by the University of Auckland and UniServices, the commercialisation arm and knowledge transfer company of the University of Auckland, in 2017 in the Chinese city of Hangzhou. The Institute occupies a 2800m¬≤ physical space in the Hangzhou Qiantang New Area. UOAIIC is led by Dr Yuan Li. It organises annual conferences and meetings for the university to seek commercial opportunities for its research in China.

==== Aulin College ====
Aulin College, based in Harbin, China, was set up by the University of Auckland and the Northeast Forestry University (NEFU) of China in 2019. The name &#x27;Aulin&#x27; is a combination of the word &quot;Au&quot; (from the name &quot;Auckland&quot;) and &quot;Lin&quot;, which is the Chinese word for farming and agriculture. In September 2019, Aulin College had its first intake of undergraduate students. Aulin College offers Bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in Biotechnology, Chemistry, Computer Science and Technology. Graduates will receive degrees from both the University of Auckland and NEFU.

===Libraries===

The University of Auckland Library system consists of the General Library and four specialist libraries: the Davis Law Library, Leigh Marine Laboratory Library, the Philson Library (Medical and Health Sciences), and the Sylvia Ashton-Warner Library (Education and Social Work) on the Tai Tokerau campus.

In mid-2018, Vice-Chancellor McCutcheon announced that the university would be closing its Fine Arts, Architecture and Planning, and Music and Dance Libraries. Their collections were merged into the General Library&#x27;s collections.

The General Library Special Collections stores several rare books, manuscripts and archives and other material relating to the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands. Some notable manuscript collections include the Western Pacific Archives (which contains British colonial records relating to that region between 1877 and 1978), the poet Robin Hyde&#x27;s papers, and the archives of the New Zealand Electronic Poetry Centre, local Labour Party branches, and the New Zealand Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. The Special Collections also has several published collections including the Patterson Collection (which contains books on biblical studies, classics, and ancient history), children&#x27;s author Betty Gilderdale&#x27;s collection of New Zealand children&#x27;s books, the Philson Library&#x27;s collections of pre-1900 medical books, and the Asian Language Collection (which contains 230 titles of rare Chinese books). Some notable microtext collections include the MƒÅori Land Court Minute Books and the Pacific Manuscripts Bureau series.

===Student accommodation===
The University of Auckland provides a range of accommodation options for students. Several hundred live in Residential Halls and Apartments, which provide, food, accommodation, and social and welfare services alongside self-catered, private residences. The university ceased leasing Railway Campus in November 2008.

The university has four residential halls including Grafton Hall, O&#x27;Rorke Hall, University Hall‚ÄìTowers, and WaipƒÅr≈´r≈´ Hall. These halls are full-catered and are aimed at first‚Äìyear university students.

In addition, the university runs nine self-catered student residences including Te Tirohanga o te T≈çangaroa, Carlaw Park Student Village, Grafton Student Flats, 55 Symonds, University Hall‚ÄìTowers, UniLodge Auckland, UniLodge on Whitaker, Waikohanga House, and the Goldie Estate Homestead on Waiheke Island. These halls and student residences are located in the Auckland CBD area near the university.

===Hiwa, Recreation Centre===
A new recreational centre, named Hiwa, opened in the city campus in November 2024. It replaced the old recreation centre that was built in 1978, when the university had approximately 10,000 students studying on city campus.
Hiwa was built at a cost of NZ$320 million. Vice-Chancellor Dawn Freshwater and Infrastructure Minister Chris Bishop officially opened the building on 21 February 2025.

===Art Collection===
Established in 1966 by Keith Sinclair and Bob Chapman, The Art Collection is one of the university&#x27;s most valuable and cherished assets. However, its most poignant value lies in its use as a resource for teaching, learning and research. Available on loan to departments and faculties on all campuses, the Collection has been built up over forty years to include major works by significant artists such as Frances Hodgkins, Colin McCahon, Luise Fong, Billy Apple and Ralph Hotere. Outcomes from postgraduate research on the Collection have included a thesis on its own history as an entity, monograph exhibitions on individual artists, and surveys of the impact of the evolution of the Collection on Auckland&#x27;s dealer galleries, resulting in the exhibitions and publications Vuletic and His Circle (about the Petar/James Gallery) in 2003 and New Vision Gallery in 2008.

==Academic Profile==

===Admission and costs===
Since eliminating open entry in 2009, all applicants must have a university entrance qualification. Domestic students are required to achieve the NZQA University Entrance Standard, while international students must achieve an equivalent approved qualification in their country. Admission to the university also requires applicants to meet the preset academic and English language entry requirements specific to the degree for which they are applying. Some programmes also have a preset number of places available within the degree. To be guaranteed entry students must achieve a rank score as well as meet any additional requirements.
All students who did not complete their high school education or equivalent in English are also required to provide a valid IELTS score (minimum of 6.0) or equivalent.

=== Reputation and rankings ===
The University of Auckland is New Zealand&#x27;s leading university. It is the highest ranked New Zealand university in the QS World University Rankings and Shanghai Jiao Tong Academic Ranking of World Universities, and along with the University of Otago and the Auckland University of Technology is included in the Times Higher Education top 250.

QS World University Rankings
The University of Auckland has consistently ranked as a top 100 university in the QS World University Rankings. The University of Auckland ranked 65 globally in the 2025 QS World University Rankings, rising three places from its ranking of 68 in the 2024 QS rankings. The University of Auckland was also ranked 5th in the QS World University Sustainability Rankings which measure an institution&#x27;s ability to tackle global environmental, social and governance (ESG) challenges. The University also ranked in the top 100 in several QS subject rankings including: Arts &amp; Humanities (ranked 70), Life Sciences &amp; Medicine (ranked 89), and Social Sciences &amp; Management (ranked =69). 

University Impact Rankings
In 2020, the University of Auckland is ranked Number 1 globally in the University Impact Rankings by Times Higher Education. The result recognised the university&#x27;s performance against the United Nations&#x27; Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the university&#x27;s commitment to sustainability and making positive social impacts.

PBRF rankings
The University of Auckland is a research-led university, and had the second highest ranking in the 2006 and 2012 Performance Based Research Fund (PBRF) exercises and the fourth highest ranking in the 2018 PBRF exercise. The Performance Based Research Fund exercises are conducted by the government and evaluate the quality of researchers and research output of all tertiary institutions in New Zealand.

In the previous PBRF evaluation in 2003, when the university was ranked the top research university in New Zealand, the Commission commented: &quot;On virtually any measure, the University of Auckland is the country‚Äôs leading research university. Not only did it achieve the highest quality score of any TEO [tertiary education organisation], but it also has by far the largest share of A-rated researchers in the country.&quot;

===CECIL===
CECIL (CSL, short for Computer Supported Learning) was the university&#x27;s learning management and course management system before Canvas and was developed in-house. It had more than 44,000 log-ins per day (2008 April). Cecil support staff worked with academics on research into cheating detections during online assessment, productivity improvement using a learning management system (LMS), and effectiveness of tools in LMS. Cecil contains many of the features of similar systems such as Sakai Project and WebCT. Cecil also provides interactive tools for collaboration and other tools specific to the university. In 2014, a review of learning and teaching technology was initiated, seeking to replace Cecil. The review determined that Canvas (a learning management system developed by Instructure) would be implemented prior to the commencement of the 2016 academic year, and CECIL now acts as an archive for old courses.

==Student life==
===Students&#x27; association===

The Auckland University Students&#x27; Association (AUSA) is the representative body of students, formed in 1891. AUSA publicises student issues, administers student facilities, and assists affiliated student clubs and societies. AUSA produces the student magazine &quot;Craccum&quot;, and runs the radio station &quot;95bFM&quot;. The name of the alumni association is the University of Auckland Society.

=== Student demographics ===
==Controversies==
===Restructuring measures===
In April 2016, Vice-Chancellor Stuart McCutcheon announced that University of Auckland would be selling off its Epsom and Tamaki campuses in order to consolidate education and services at the city, Grafton, and Newmarket campuses. The Epsom Campus is the site of the University of Auckland&#x27;s education faculty while the Tamaki campus hosts elements of the medical and science faculties as well as the School of Population Health.

In mid-June 2018, McCutcheon announced that the university would be closing down and merging its specialist fine arts, architecture, and music and dance libraries into the City Campus&#x27; General Library. In addition, the university would cut 100 support jobs. The Vice-Chancellor claimed that these cutbacks would save between NZ$3 million and $4 million a year. This announcement triggered criticism and several protests from arts faculty and students. Students objected to the closure of the Elam Fine Arts Library on the grounds that it would make it harder to access study materials. Thousands of dissenters circulated a petition protesting the Vice-Chancellor&#x27;s restructuring policies. Protests were also held in April, May, and June 2018.

===Fossil fuel divestment controversy===
In April 2017, more than 100 students from the Auckland University Medical Students Association marched demanding the removal of coal, oil and gas from the university&#x27;s investment portfolio. In May 2017, 14 people from student group Fossil Fuel UoA occupied the Clocktower, urging current Vice Chancellor Professor Stuart McCutcheon to issue a statement in support of divestment from fossil fuels. After twelve hours, they were forcibly removed by police. The following day over two hundred students and staff marched to demand divestment from fossil fuels and more than 240 members of staff from 8 faculties signed an open letter supporting divestment to the Boards of the University of Auckland Foundation and School of Medicine Foundation. Today, the University of Auckland Foundation has a Responsible Investment Policy. The foundation has now effectively eliminated fossil fuels from its investment portfolio. As at 31 December 2021, only 0.005% (31 December 2020 0.49%) of the foundation&#x27;s investments were held in companies deriving revenue from fossil fuels.

===Vice Chancellor&#x27;s house===
In early December 2020, the Auditor-General&#x27;s Office released its report criticising the University of Auckland&#x27;s decision to purchase a NZ$5 million house in Auckland&#x27;s Parnell suburb for Vice Chancellor Dawn Freshwater, ruling that the university had not been able to show a &quot;justifiable business purpose&quot; for purchasing the house apart from Freshwater&#x27;s personal benefit. The purchase of the house had been criticised as frivolous by student unions. In October 2020, Vice Chancellor Freshwater had recommended that the university&#x27;s board sell the house to pay off debt and because COVID-19 social distancing restrictions had made it impossible to host functions there.

=== Siouxsie Wiles v University of Auckland ===
In January 2022 Siouxsie Wiles and Shaun Hendy filed claims with the Employment Relations Authority against the University of Auckland. They alleged that the University did not protect them from harassment for their COVID-19 commentary advocacy for vaccination. In October 2022, Hendy resolved the dispute after leaving the university. Wiles started the hearing in early November 2023, and at the end of three week hearing, Judge Holden reserved her decision. On 8 July 2024, the Employment Court ruled in Wiles&#x27; favour. The Court also ruled that the University did not breach her academic freedom. The University was ordered to pay Wiles&#x27; NZ$20,000 in damages.

=== 2024 student accommodation rent strike ===
In 2024, a group of students residing in University of Auckland accommodation initiated &quot;rent strike&quot; on 1 May 2024, following an 8% increase in accommodation costs for the academic year. 

===2024 course review===
In August 2024 the University&#x27;s leadership notified academics across the institution that a &quot;course optimisation&quot; was in progress. This would reduce the number of courses offered at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and was met with outcry by faculty members. The senate, a group of senior faculty who advise the University Council, voted to pause the ongoing curriculum redesign that had prompted the proposed changes. There were also objections from students and Tertiary Education Union members, who formed a group protesting the changes.

===Notable faculty===
Until his death in 2009, the longest serving staff member was Emeritus Professor of Prehistory, Roger Curtis Green, BA BSc &quot;(New Mexico)&quot;, PhD &quot;(Harv.)&quot;, FRSNZ, MANAS. He had been on the staff 1961‚Äì66 and from 1973 onwards. The longest serving, non-&#x27;retired&#x27; staff member is Bernard Brown, ONZM, LLB (Hons) &quot;(Leeds)&quot;, LLM &quot;(Sing.)&quot;. He has been a full-time senior lecturer in the faculty of law 1962-65 and 1969 onwards. William Phillips, the influential economist largely famed for his Phillips curve, taught at the university from 1969 until his death in 1975. The programming language R, widely used by statisticians and data scientists, was developed at the university by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka in the 1990s.

According to the Association of University Staff of New Zealand (AUS) in 2007, New Zealand universities, including the University of Auckland, had been taking a more litigious approach to managing their staff in recent years and engaged lawyers and employment advocates to handle even minor matters. The University of Auckland &quot;paid out more than $780,000 in 2006 to settle problems it listed as including personal grievances and disputes&quot;. For example, Paul Buchanan, a popular, world-renowned lecturer on international relations and security, was summarily dismissed in 2007 because a student to whom he sent an email complained that she found his comments about her performance in his class to be offensive. He was later reinstated, but this was just a formality and he never returned to lecturing. As the AUS would not financially support a case for full reinstatement, Buchanan accepted the formal reinstatement and a nominal monetary payout as a settlement of his appeal to the Employment Court.

<doc id="277462" wikidata="Q17349491" url="?curid=277462" title="Commerce Clause">
<text>The Commerce Clause describes an enumerated power listed in the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3). The clause states that the United States Congress shall have power &quot;to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes&quot;. Courts and commentators have tended to discuss each of these three areas of commerce as a separate power granted to Congress. It is common to see the individual components of the Commerce Clause referred to under specific terms: the Foreign Commerce Clause, the Interstate Commerce Clause, and the Indian Commerce Clause.

Dispute exists within the courts as to the range of powers granted to Congress by the Commerce Clause. As noted below, it is often paired with the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the combination used to take a more broad, expansive perspective of these powers.

During the Marshall Court era (1801‚Äì1835), interpretation of the Commerce Clause gave Congress jurisdiction over numerous aspects of intrastate and interstate commerce as well as activity that had traditionally been regarded not to be commerce. Starting in 1937, following the end of the &quot;Lochner&quot; era, the use of the Commerce Clause by Congress to authorize federal control of economic matters became effectively unlimited. The US Supreme Court restricted congressional use of the Commerce Clause somewhat with &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; (1995).

The Commerce Clause is the source of federal drug prohibition laws under the Controlled Substances Act. In a 2005 medical marijuana case, &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the argument that the ban on growing medical marijuana for personal use exceeded the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Even if no goods were sold or transported across state lines, the Court found that there could be an indirect effect on interstate commerce and relied heavily on a New Deal case, &quot;Wickard v. Filburn&quot;, which held that the government may regulate personal cultivation and consumption of crops because the aggregate effect of individual consumption could have an indirect effect on interstate commerce.

==Text and pairing==
Article I, Section 8, Clause 3:

The significance of the Commerce Clause is described in the Supreme Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot;, :

The Commerce Clause represents one of the most fundamental powers delegated to the Congress by the founders. The outer limits of the Interstate Commerce Clause power have been the subject of long, intense political controversy. Interpretation of the sixteen words of the Commerce Clause has helped define the balance of power between the federal government and the states and the balance of power between the two elected branches of the federal government and the Judiciary. As such, it directly affects the lives of American citizens.

=== Significance in federal rights in navigable waters ===

The Commerce Clause provides comprehensive powers to the United States over navigable waters. The powers are critical to understand the rights of landowners adjoining or exercising what would otherwise be riparian rights under the common law. The Commerce Clause confers a unique position upon the federal government in connection with navigable waters: &quot;The power to regulate commerce comprehends the control for that purpose, and to the extent necessary, of all the navigable waters of the United States... For this purpose they are the public property of the nation, and subject to all the requisite legislation by Congress.&quot; &quot;United States v. Rands&quot;, . The &quot;Rands&quot; decision continues:

This power to regulate navigation confers upon the United States a dominant servitude, &quot;FPC v. Niagara Mohawk Power Corp.&quot;, 347 U.S. 239, 249 (1954), which extends to the entire stream and the stream bed below ordinary high-water mark. The proper exercise of this power is not an invasion of any private property rights in the stream or the lands underlying it, for the damage sustained does not result from taking property from riparian owners within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment but from the lawful exercise of a power to which the interests of riparian owners have always been subject. &quot;United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. &amp; P. R. Co.&quot;, 312 U.S. 592, 596‚Äì597 (1941); &quot;Gibson v. United States&quot;, 166 U.S. 269, 275‚Äì276 (1897). Thus, without being constitutionally obligated to pay compensation, the United States may change the course of a navigable stream, &quot;South Carolina v. Georgia&quot;, 93 U.S. 4 (1876), or otherwise impair or destroy a riparian owner&#x27;s access to navigable waters, &quot;Gibson v. United States&quot;, 166 U.S. 269 (1897); &quot;Scranton v. Wheeler&quot;, 179 U.S. 141 (1900); &quot;United States v. Commodore Park, Inc.&quot;, 324 U.S. 386 (1945), even though the market value of the riparian owner&#x27;s land is substantially diminished.

Some scholars, such as Robert H. Bork and Daniel E. Troy, argue that prior to 1887, the Commerce Clause was rarely invoked by Congress and so a broad interpretation of the word &quot;commerce&quot; was clearly never intended by the Founding Fathers. In support of that claim, they argue that the word &quot;commerce,&quot; as used in the Constitutional Convention and the Federalist Papers, can be substituted with either &quot;trade&quot; or &quot;exchange&quot; interchangeably and still preserve the meaning of those statements. They also point to James Madison&#x27;s statement in an 1828 letter that the &quot;Constitution vests in Congress expressly... &#x27;the power to regulate trade&#x27;.&quot;

Examining contemporaneous dictionaries does not neatly resolve the matter. For instance, the 1792 edition of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; defines the noun &quot;commerce&quot; narrowly as &quot;[e]xchange of one thing for another; interchange of any thing; trade; traffick,&quot; but it defines the corresponding verb &quot;to commerce&quot; more broadly as &quot;[t]o hold intercourse.&quot; The word &quot;intercourse&quot; also had a different and wider meaning back in 1792, compared to today.

Nevertheless, in &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot; (1824), the Court ruled unanimously that congressional power extends to regulation over navigable waters.

===Early years (1800s‚Äì1830s)===
Chief Justice John Marshall ruled in &quot;Gibbons v. Ogden&quot; (1824) that the power to regulate interstate commerce also included the power to regulate interstate navigation: &quot;Commerce, undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more‚Äîit is intercourse... [A] power to regulate navigation is as expressly granted, as if that term had been added to the word &#x27;commerce&#x27;... [T]he power of Congress does not stop at the jurisdictional lines of the several states. It would be a very useless power if it could not pass those lines.&quot; The Court&#x27;s decision contains language supporting one important line of Commerce Clause jurisprudence, the idea that the electoral process of representative government represents the primary limitation on the exercise of the Commerce Clause powers:

The wisdom and the discretion of Congress, their identity with the people, and the influence which their constituents possess at elections, are, in this, as in many other instances, as that, for example, of declaring war, the sole restraints on which they have relied, to secure them from its abuse. They are the restraints on which the people must often rely solely, in all representative governments...

In &quot;Gibbons&quot;, the Court struck down New York State&#x27;s attempt to grant a steamboat monopoly to Robert Fulton, which he had then ultimately franchised to Ogden, who claimed river traffic was not &quot;commerce&quot; under the Commerce Clause and that Congress could not interfere with New York State&#x27;s grant of an exclusive monopoly within its own borders. Ogden&#x27;s assertion was untenable: he contended that New York could control river traffic within New York all the way to the border with New Jersey and that New Jersey could control river traffic within New Jersey all the way to the border with New York, leaving Congress with the power to control the traffic as it crossed the state line.

Thus, Ogden contended, Congress could not invalidate his monopoly if transported passengers only within New York. The Supreme Court, however, found that Congress could invalidate his monopoly since it was operational on an interstate channel of navigation.

In its decision, the Court assumed interstate commerce required movement of the subject of regulation across state borders. The decision contains the following principles, some of which have since been altered by subsequent decisions:
* Commerce is &quot;intercourse, all its branches, and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse.&quot;
* Commerce among the states cannot stop at the external boundary of each state, but may be introduced into the interior.
* Congress can regulate, that is &quot;to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed&quot; that &quot;may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution.&quot;

Additionally, the Marshall Court limited the extent of federal maritime and admiralty jurisdiction to tidewaters in .

===Tribal sovereignty===

In &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot;, , the Supreme Court addressed whether the Cherokee nation is a foreign state in the sense in which that term is used in the U.S. constitution. The Court provided a definition of Indian tribe that clearly made the rights of tribes far inferior to those of foreign states:

Though the Indians are acknowledged to have an unquestionable, and, heretofore, unquestioned right to the lands they occupy, until that right shall be extinguished by a voluntary cession to our government; yet it may well be doubted whether those tribes which reside within the acknowledged boundaries of the United States can, with strict accuracy, be denominated foreign nations. They may, more correctly be denominated domestic dependent nations. They occupy a territory to which we assert a title independent of their will, which must take effect in point of possession when their right of possession ceases. Meanwhile, they are in a state of pupilage. Their relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian.

===Dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence===
As explained in &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot;, , &quot;For nearly a century thereafter [that is, after &quot;Gibbons&quot;], the Court&#x27;s Commerce Clause decisions dealt but rarely with the extent of Congress&#x27; power, and almost entirely with the Commerce Clause as a limit on state legislation that discriminated against interstate commerce.&quot; Under this line of precedent, the Court held that certain categories of activity such as &quot;exhibitions&quot;, &quot;production&quot;, &quot;manufacturing&quot;, and &quot;mining&quot; were within the province of state governments, and thus were beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause. When Congress began to engage in economic regulation on a national scale, the Court&#x27;s dormant Commerce Clause decisions influenced its approach to Congressional regulation.

In this context, the Court took a formalistic approach, which distinguished between services and commerce, manufacturing and commerce, direct and indirect effects on commerce, and local and national activities. See concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy in &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot;. (&quot;One approach the Court used to inquire into the lawfulness of state authority was to draw content-based or subject-matter distinctions, thus defining by semantic or formalistic categories those activities that were commerce and those that were not.&quot;) The Dormant Commerce Clause formalisms spilled over into its Article I jurisprudence. While Congress had the power to regulate commerce, it could not regulate manufacturing, which was seen as being entirely local. In &quot;Kidd v. Pearson&quot;, , the Court struck a federal law which prohibited the manufacture of liquor for shipment across state lines. Similar decisions were issued with regard to agriculture, mining, oil production, and generation of electricity. In &quot;Swift v. United States&quot;, , the Court ruled that the clause covered meatpackers; although their activity was geographically &quot;local&quot;, they had an important effect on the &quot;current of commerce&quot;, and thus could be regulated under the Commerce Clause. The Court&#x27;s decision halted price fixing. &quot;Stafford v. Wallace&quot;, , upheld a federal law (the Packers and Stockyards Act) regulating the Chicago meatpacking industry, because the industry was part of the interstate commerce of beef from ranchers to dinner tables. The stockyards &quot;are but a throat through which the current [of commerce] flows,&quot; Chief Justice Taft wrote, referring to the stockyards as &quot;great national public utilities.&quot; As Justice Kennedy wrote: (in a concurring opinion to &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot;), &quot;Though that [formalistic] approach likely would not have survived even if confined to the question of a State&#x27;s authority to enact legislation, it was not at all propitious when applied to the quite different question of what subjects were within the reach of the national power when Congress chose to exercise it.&quot;

Similarly, the Court excluded most services by distinguishing them from commerce. In &quot;Federal Baseball Club v. National League&quot;, 259 U.S. 200 (1922), which was later upheld in &quot;Toolson v. New York Yankees&quot; (1953) and &quot;Flood v. Kuhn&quot; (1973), the Court excluded services not related to production, such as live entertainment, from the definition of commerce:

===New Deal===
In 1935, the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Schecter Poultry Corporation v. United States&quot; invalidated regulations of the poultry industry according to the nondelegation doctrine and as an invalid use of Congress&#x27;s power under the commerce clause. The unanimous decision rendered unconstitutional the National Industrial Recovery Act, a main component of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. Again in 1936, in &quot;Carter v. Carter Coal Company&quot;, the Supreme Court struck down a key element of the New Deal&#x27;s regulation of the mining industry on the grounds that mining was not &quot;commerce.&quot; In the preceding decades, the Court had struck down a laundry list of progressive legislation: minimum-wage laws, child labor laws, agricultural relief laws, and virtually every other element of the New Deal legislation that had come before it. After winning re-election in 1936, Roosevelt proposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 to allow the President to appoint an additional Justice for each sitting Justice over age 70. Given the age of the current justices, that would allow a Supreme Court of up to 15 Justices. Roosevelt claimed that to be intended to lessen the load on the older Justices, rather than an attempt to achieve a majority that would cease to strike his New Deal acts.

Ultimately, there was widespread opposition to the &quot;court packing&quot; plan, and in the end, Roosevelt abandoned it. However, in what became known as &quot;the switch in time that saved nine,&quot; Justice Owen Roberts, shortly after the &quot;court packing&quot; plan was proposed, joined the 5-4 majority opinion in &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot; (1937). It narrowly upheld a Washington state minimum wage law, abandoning prior jurisprudence, and ended the Lochner era. That essentially marked the beginning of the end of Supreme Court&#x27;s opposition to the New Deal, which also obviated the &quot;court packing&quot; scheme.

In &quot;United States v. Darby Lumber Co.&quot; (1941), the Court upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act, which regulated the production of goods shipped across state lines. It stated that the Tenth Amendment &quot;is but a truism&quot; and was not considered to be an independent limitation on congressional power.

In &quot;United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co.&quot; (1942), the Court upheld federal price regulation of intrastate milk commerce:

The commerce power is not confined in its exercise to the regulation of commerce among the states. It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce, or the exertion of the power of Congress over it, as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the effective execution of the granted power to regulate interstate commerce... The power of Congress over interstate commerce is plenary and complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution... It follows that no form of state activity can constitutionally thwart the regulatory power granted by the commerce clause to Congress. Hence, the reach of that power extends to those intrastate activities which in a substantial way interfere with or obstruct the exercise of the granted power.

In &quot;Wickard v. Filburn&quot; (1942), the Court upheld the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, which sought to stabilize wide fluctuations in the market price for wheat. The Court found that Congress could apply national quotas to wheat grown on one&#x27;s own land for one&#x27;s own consumption because the total of such local production and consumption could potentially be sufficiently large as to affect the overall national goal of stabilizing prices. The Court cited its recent &quot;Wrightwood&quot; decision and decided, &quot;Whether the subject of the regulation in question was &#x27;production,&#x27; &#x27;consumption,&#x27; or &#x27;marketing&#x27; is, therefore, not material for purposes of deciding the question of federal power before us.&quot; The Court reiterated Chief Justice Marshall&#x27;s decision in &quot;Gibbons&quot;: &quot;He made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature of this power by warning that effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political, rather than from judicial, processes.&quot; The Court also stated, &quot;The conflicts of economic interest between the regulated and those who advantage by it are wisely left under our system to resolution by the Congress under its more flexible and responsible legislative process. Such conflicts rarely lend themselves to judicial determination. And with the wisdom, workability, or fairness, of the plan of regulation, we have nothing to do.&quot;

Thereafter, the Court began to defer to the Congress on the theory that determining whether legislation affected commerce appropriately was a decision that was political and legislative, not judicial. That overall change in the Court&#x27;s jurisprudence, beginning with &quot;Parrish&quot;, is often referred to as the &quot;Constitutional Revolution of 1937&quot;, in which the Court shifted from exercising judicial review of legislative acts to protect economic rights to a paradigm that focused most strongly on protecting civil liberties.

It was not until &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; (1995) decision, after nearly 60 years of leaving any restraint on the use of the Commerce Clause to political means, that the Court again ruled that a regulation enacted under the Commerce Clause was unconstitutional.

===Civil rights===
The wide interpretation of the scope of the Commerce Clause continued following the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which aimed to prevent business from discriminating against black customers. The Supreme Court issued several opinions supporting that use of the Commerce Clause. &quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States&quot;, , ruled that Congress could regulate a business that served mostly interstate travelers. &quot;Daniel v. Paul&quot;, 395 U.S. 298 (1969), ruled that the federal government could regulate a recreational facility because three of the four items sold at its snack bar were purchased from outside the state.

==&quot;United States v. Lopez&quot;==
=== Change in jurisprudence ===
Starting in 1995, the Rehnquist Court&#x27;s revived federalism, as evident in its 5‚Äì4 decision in &quot;United States v. Lopez,&quot; enforced strict limits to congressional power under the Commerce Clause. In &quot;Lopez&quot;, the Court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990. It was the first time in almost 60 years that the Court had struck down a federal law for exceeding the limits of the Commerce Clause. In the case, the Court was confronted with the conviction of a high school student for carrying a concealed handgun into school in violation of the act.

In striking down the federal law, the majority opinion explained:

[The Gun-Free School Zones Act] is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with &quot;commerce&quot; or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms. [The act] is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholding regulations of activities that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.
=== The &quot;Lopez&quot; rule ===
The opinion set a new rule for what was an acceptable use of congressional power under the Commerce Clause:

* Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce;
* Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in Interstate Commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities;
* Congress&#x27;s commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce (activities that substantially affect interstate commerce).

==== Channels of commerce and the instrumentalities of interstate commerce ====
Channels of commerce represent a broad congressional power that directly regulates the movement of goods and people across state lines. Importantly, the Court has never required a nexus (causal link) between a state border crossing and the engagement in an activity prohibited by Congress. In &quot;United States v. Sullivan&quot; (1948), the Court held that Section 301k of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which prohibited the misbranding of pharmaceutical drugs transported in interstate commerce, did not exceed the congressional commerce power because Congress has the power to ‚Äúkeep the channels of such commerce free from the transportation of illicit or harmful articles.‚Äù Topics in this category include mailing or shipping in interstate commerce, prohibiting crimes where the individual crossed a state line to commit the act, and explosives.

The instrumentalities category allows Congress to make regulations in regards to &quot;the safety, efficiency, and accessibility of the nationwide transportation and communications networks.&quot; It is a significant basis for congressional authority however it has not been fully occupied by Congress.

==== Substantial impact on interstate commerce ====
The substantial impact (or substantial affect) category relates to the power discussed in the Court&#x27;s 1942 decision in &quot;Wickard v. Filburn&quot;. It is arguably the strongest categorical power in the &quot;Lopez&quot; rule. In essence, it relates to economic activities which, in the aggregate, have a substantial impact on interstate commerce. The Court has stopped short of establishing a rule prohibiting the aggregation of all non-economic activity.

In determining whether the activity Congress is attempting to regulate has a substantial effect on interstate commerce, reviewing courts typically consider the following factors: (1) whether the regulated activity is commercial or economic in nature; (2) whether an express jurisdictional element is provided in the statute to limit its reach; (3) whether Congress made express findings about the effects of the proscribed activity on interstate commerce; and (4) whether the link between the prohibited activity and the effect on interstate commerce is attenuated.

== Other Rehnquist Court decisions ==

=== &quot;United States v. Morrison&quot; ===
&quot;Lopez&quot; was clarified by the Rehnquist Court in &quot;United States v. Morrison&quot;, . In &quot;Morrison,&quot; the Court invalidated ¬ß¬†40302 of the Violence Against Women Act (&quot;VAWA&quot;), which created civil liability for the commission of a gender-based violent crime but without any jurisdictional requirement of a connection to interstate commerce or to commercial activity. Once again, the Court stated it was presented with a congressional attempt to criminalize traditional local criminal conduct. As in &quot;Lopez&quot;, it could not be argued that state regulation alone would be ineffective to protect the aggregate effects of local violence. The Court explained that in both &quot;Lopez&quot; and &quot;Morrison&quot;, &quot;the noneconomic, criminal nature of the conduct at issue was central to our decision.&quot; Furthermore, the Court pointed out that neither case had &quot;&#x27;express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach (to those instances that) have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.&#x27;&quot; In both cases, Congress criminalized activity that was not commercial in nature without including a jurisdictional element establishing the necessary connection between the criminalized activity and interstate commerce.

=== New Federalism and &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot; ===
The Rehnquist Court&#x27;s Commerce Clause cases helped establish the doctrine of &quot;New Federalism.&quot; The Court&#x27;s New Federalism doctrine was focused on reining in congressional powers in order to re-strengthen the powers of the individual states which had been weakened during the New Deal era. Members on the Rehnquist Court theorized that by re-apportioning power back to the states, individual liberty was strengthened. In contrast, Erwin Chemerinsky believes that limiting the commerce power as the Rehnquist Court did can only lead to the weakening of individual liberties.

The outer limits of the New Federalism doctrine were delineated by &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot; in which Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy departed from their previous positions in the &quot;Lopez&quot; and &quot;Morrison&quot; to uphold a federal law regarding marijuana. The Court found the federal law valid although the marijuana in question had been grown and consumed within a single state and had never entered interstate commerce. The court held Congress may regulate an intrastate economic good as part of a complete scheme of legislation designed to regulate interstate commerce.

Since the Rehnquist Court, the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution has once again played an integral part in the Court&#x27;s view of the Commerce Clause. The Tenth Amendment states that the federal government has the powers specifically delegated to it by the Constitution and that other powers are reserved to the states or to the people. The Commerce Clause is an important source of those powers delegated to Congress and so its interpretation is very important in determining the scope of federal power in controlling innumerable aspects of American life. The Commerce Clause has been the most broadly-interpreted clause in the Constitution, making way for many laws that some argue, contradict the original intended meaning of the Constitution. Justice Thomas has gone so far as to state in his dissent to &quot;Gonzales&quot;,

The Rehnquist court upheld Congress&#x27;s plenary authority to legislate in Indian affairs that was derived from &quot;Worcester&quot;&#x27;s interpretation of the Indian Commerce Clause, but it modified &quot;Worcester&quot; by giving the states some jurisdiction over Indian affairs beyond what had been granted to them by Congress. Another view is that the Court was compelled to define limits to address congressional legislation that sought to use the Commerce Clause power in new and unprecedented ways.

The Court found in &quot;Seminole Tribe v. Florida&quot;, that unlike the Fourteenth Amendment, the Commerce Clause does not give the federal government the power to abrogate the sovereign immunity of the states.

== Themes ==

===Rational basis review===
The evolving level of scrutiny applied by federal courts to cases involving the Commerce Clause should be considered in the context of rational basis review. The idea behind rational basis review is that the judiciary must show deference to the elected representatives of the people. A respect for the democratic process requires courts to uphold legislation if there are rational facts and reasons that could support congressional judgment, even if the justices would have come to different conclusions. Throughout the 20th century, in a variety of contexts, courts sought to avoid second guessing the legislative branch, and Commerce Clause jurisprudence can be seen as a part of that trend, as Laurence Tribe stated:

Since 1937, in applying the factual test in &quot;Jones &amp; Laughlin&quot; to hold a broad range of activities sufficiently related to interstate commerce, the Supreme Court has exercised little independent judgment, choosing instead to defer to the expressed or implied findings of Congress to the effect that regulated activities have the requisite &quot;economic effect&quot;. Such findings have been upheld whenever they could be said to rest upon some rational basis. (Citing &quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v United States&quot; (1964).)

Justice Rehnquist echoed that point in his opinion in &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; by stating: &quot;Since [&quot;Wickard&quot;], the Court has... undertaken to decide whether a rational basis existed for concluding that a regulated activity sufficiently affected interstate commerce. See, e.g., &quot;Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Association&quot;, 452 U.S. 264, 276‚Äì280 (1981); &quot;Perez v. United States&quot;, 402 U.S. 146, 155‚Äì156 (1971); &quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States&quot;, 379 U.S. 241, 252‚Äì253 (1964).&quot;

Rational basis review begins with establishing the factual predicate upon which the exercise of congressional power is based. The factual basis might come from a variety of sources. It might come from factual determinations made by Congress, passed in the legislation itself, or found in the congressional reports that are issued to accompany the legislation. It might come from the record of testimony compiled in committee hearings. It might come from facts posited by proponents in their briefs in support of the legislation. For example, the Court referenced extensive testimony presented in hearings in support of the conclusion that discrimination in public accommodations reduces interstate commerce. The Court wrote:

Of course, the mere fact that Congress has said when particular activity shall be deemed to affect commerce does not preclude further examination by this Court. But where we find that the legislators, in light of the facts and testimony before them, have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end.

Similarly, in &quot;Gonzales v. Raich&quot; the Court upheld a ban on growing marijuana intended for medical use on the grounds that Congress could rationally conclude that such cultivation might make enforcement of drug laws more difficult by creating an otherwise-lawful source of marijuana that could be diverted into the illicit market:

In assessing the scope of Congress&#x27; authority under the Commerce Clause, we stress that the task before us is a modest one. We need not determine whether respondents&#x27; activities, taken in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce in fact, but only whether a &quot;rational basis&quot; exists for so concluding. Given the enforcement difficulties that attend distinguishing between marijuana cultivated locally and marijuana grown elsewhere, 21 U.S.C. ¬ß 801(5), and concerns about diversion into illicit channels, we have no difficulty concluding that Congress had a rational basis for believing that failure to regulate the intrastate manufacture and possession of marijuana would leave a gaping hole in the CSA.

===Role of the political process===
Since its decision in &quot;Gibbons&quot;, the Supreme Court has held that Congress may regulate only those activities within a state that arise out of or are connected with a commercial transaction and that, viewed in the aggregate, substantially affect interstate commerce. Since judicial interpretations of constitutional limitations on Congressional exercise of its Commerce Clause powers represent an invasion of the democratic process which may not be overturned through ordinary democratic means, the Court has continued to assert that the primary limitation on the unwise exercise of Congressional Commerce Clause power by Congress must be found at the ballot box. Thus in &quot;Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority&quot;, , the Court stated:

Of course, we continue to recognize that the States occupy a special and specific position in our constitutional system and that the scope of Congress&#x27; authority under the Commerce Clause must reflect that position. But the principal and basic limit on the federal commerce power is that inherent in all congressional action‚Äîthe built-in restraints that our system provides through state participation in federal governmental action. The political process ensures that laws that unduly burden the States will not be promulgated.

=== Debate over applicability to Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ===
Questions over the range and applicability of the Commerce Clause have arisen in debate over the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&quot;PPACA&quot;). The debate centers on whether Congress is authorized to require citizens to purchase health insurance from the private market, known as the &quot;individual mandate&quot;. Although Congress had invoked its authority from the Commerce Clause to enact the mandate, many opponents of the PPACA claim that the individual mandate exceeds Congress&#x27;s authority, primarily on the position that the law attempts to define the nonpurchase of insurance as &quot;commerce.&quot;

Twenty-six state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against the federal government and claimed that the insurance mandate is unconstitutional. On June 8, 2011, a panel of three judges from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta held hearings on that issue. On August 12, 2011. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the individual mandate to be unconstitutional and stated that Congress had exceeded its authority by requiring Americans to buy coverage.

Differing court opinions have clashed over the question of whether failure to purchase insurance can be considered an economic activity that affects interstate commerce. In &quot;Virginia v. Sebelius&quot;, Judge Henry Hudson overturned the law and claimed that failure to purchase health insurance coverage could not be considered economic activity but was economic &quot;inactivity.&quot; In &quot;Liberty University v. Geithner&quot;, Judge Norman Moon upheld the law, countering:

Far from &#x27;inactivity,&#x27; by choosing to forgo insurance, Plaintiffs are making an economic decision to try to pay for health care services later, out of pocket, rather than now, through the purchase of insurance.

Similarly, in &quot;Thomas More Law Center v. Obama&quot;, judge George Steeh ruled that such decisions have &quot;a documented impact on interstate commerce.&quot;

In response to the Virginia decision, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the appeal immediately, rather than going through the Fourth Circuit. On November 14, 2011, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear the case in the spring of 2012. The Supreme Court heard arguments on March 26‚Äì28, 2012. Its majority opinion agreed that upholding the PPACA under the commerce clause &quot;would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority&quot; and that &quot;the power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated.&quot; The Court held that Congress did not have authority under the Commerce Clause to require citizens to purchase health insurance but still upheld the law&#x27;s &quot;individual mandate&quot; provision under Congress&#x27;s taxing authority.

<doc id="277463" wikidata="Q20178" url="?curid=277463" title="Joe Pesci">
<text>Joseph Frank Pesci ( , ; born February 9, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, and musician. He is known for portraying tough, volatile characters in a variety of genres and for his collaborations with Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese in the films &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980), &quot;Goodfellas&quot; (1990), &quot;Casino&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Irishman&quot; (2019). He has received several awards including an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award with nominations for three Golden Globe Awards.

He also appeared in &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984), &quot;Moonwalker&quot; (1988), &quot;JFK&quot; (1991), &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot; (2006). Pesci is also known for his comic roles in &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990) and &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992), &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; (1992), and the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; franchise (1989‚Äì1998).

Pesci won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the gangster character Tommy DeVito in &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and received two other nominations in the same category for his portrayals of Joey LaMotta and Russell Bufalino in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; and &quot;The Irishman&quot;, respectively. He announced his retirement from acting in 1999, but has periodically returned to act since then.

Pesci is also a musician who has recorded three studio albums: &quot;Little Joe Sure Can Sing!&quot; (1968), &quot;Vincent LaGuardia Gambini Sings Just for You&quot; (1998), and &quot;Pesci... Still Singing&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Pesci was born on February 9, 1943, in Newark, New Jersey. His mother, Maria (Mesce), worked part time as a barber, and his father, Angelo Pesci, was a forklift truck driver for General Motors and a bartender. He is of Italian descent with family origins both in Turin and Aquilonia in the province of Avellino. Pesci was raised in Belleville, New Jersey, and graduated from Belleville High School. 

By the time Pesci was five years old he was appearing in plays in New York. At age 10 he was a regular on a television variety show called &quot;Startime Kids&quot;, which also featured Connie Francis. As an entertainer from Belleville, he was acquainted with guitarist Tommy DeVito of The Four Lovers, a novelty act from Belleville that included singer Frankie Valli; Pesci also knew keyboardist Bob Gaudio of The Royal Teens. Pesci introduced Gaudio to DeVito and Valli in 1958, which led to the formation of the band The Four Seasons. Pesci and DeVito remained friends for the rest of DeVito&#x27;s life; when DeVito fell on hard times in the 1970s following his resignation from the Four Seasons, Pesci placed DeVito on his personal payroll, and Pesci arranged for DeVito to make cameos in some of Pesci&#x27;s 1990s films. 

Pesci was childhood friends with American Mafia figure Robert Bisaccia.

==Career==
===Early career===
In the 1960s, Pesci began working as a barber, following in his mother&#x27;s footsteps. At the same time, he tried to start a musical career, playing guitar with several bands, including Joey Dee and the Starliters who introduced the &quot;Peppermint Twist&quot; record, dance, and Peppermint Lounge in New York City.

In 1968, he released his debut album &quot;Little Joe Sure Can Sing!&quot; (billed as &quot;Joe Ritchie&quot;), on which he sang covers of contemporary pop hits.

Pesci later joined Frank Vincent as a comedy duo, performing as &quot;Vincent and Pesci&quot; from 1970 to 1976. Their act coupled Abbott and Costello-inspired double act antics with Don Rickles-style insult comedy, which proved popular with crowds. During this time, the pair developed a strong professional and personal friendship. In 1975, they appeared in the Broadway show &quot;The New Vaudevillians&quot;, which only lasted one week.

The first film Pesci starred in was the 1976 low-budget crime film &quot;The Death Collector&quot; alongside Frank Vincent. After the film Pesci returned to The Bronx and lived above Amici&#x27;s Restaurant, where he was an employee.

===Acting===

In 1979, Pesci received a phone call from Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, who were impressed with his performance in &quot;The Death Collector&quot; and asked him to co-star in Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Raging Bull&quot; as Joey LaMotta. During the course of filming Pesci broke one of his ribs.

Pesci won the BAFTA Film Award for Newcomer to Leading Film Roles in 1981 and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Over the next few years, Pesci appeared in several smaller films, including &quot;Dear Mr. Wonderful&quot; (1982), &quot;Eureka&quot; (1983) and &quot;Easy Money&quot; (1983).

In 1984, he was cast in &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, again appearing alongside De Niro. The following year he starred as private detective Rocky Nelson in the short-lived television comedy series &quot;Half Nelson&quot;.

In 1988, Pesci appeared in the Michael Jackson musical anthology film &quot;Moonwalker&quot;, in the film&#x27;s sixth and longest segment, &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;. He played the antagonist, crime boss Frankie &quot;Mr. Big&quot; LiDeo (an anagram for one of the film&#x27;s producers and longtime Jackson manager Frank DiLeo, with whom Pesci later acted in &quot;Goodfellas&quot;).

He appeared as Leo Getz, a comedic sidekick and best friend to protagonist detectives Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) in the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; sequels, released in 1989, 1992 and 1998.

In 1990, he reunited with Scorsese and De Niro for &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, in which he played mobster Tommy DeVito, based on real-life mobster Thomas DeSimone. Tommy DeVito was also the name of Pesci&#x27;s old acquaintance from Belleville, New Jersey, and a member of The Four Seasons, but contrary to popular belief, the naming is coincidental. Pesci&#x27;s old friend Frank Vincent also appears in the film. Pesci&#x27;s character kills Vincent&#x27;s character in a rage in one of the best-remembered scenes in the film after the Vincent character contemptuously tells him to &quot;go home and get your fucking shine box&quot;. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals, where Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography. 

For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him‚Äîthe &quot;Funny how? Do I amuse you?&quot; scene‚Äîis based on an actual event that Pesci experienced. He was waiting tables when he thought he made a compliment to a mobster by saying he was &quot;funny&quot;, which was not taken well. It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script. The dinner scene with Tommy&#x27;s mother was largely improvised. Pesci received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role, which he accepted with one of the shortest speeches in Oscar history, saying simply, &quot;It&#x27;s my privilege. Thank you&quot; before leaving the stage.

Pesci also co-starred in the blockbuster &quot;Home Alone&quot; in 1990, his character Harry Lime one of two bumbling burglars - along with Daniel Stern as Marv Murchins - who attempt to burgle the house of an eight-year-old played by Macaulay Culkin. Pesci&#x27;s use of &quot;cartoon cursing&quot;, or menacing gibberish, garnered comparisons to &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; character Yosemite Sam. Two years later, Pesci reprised his role in a sequel &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;.

In 1991, Pesci played David Ferrie in &quot;JFK&quot;. In 1992, he appeared as the title character in the comedy &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; with Ralph Macchio, Marisa Tomei and Fred Gwynne. During the same year Pesci headed up the cast of &quot;The Public Eye&quot; as Leon &quot;Bernzy&quot; Bernstein, a photographer. His performance in the film, a departure from his usual characters, has been critically acclaimed.

Pesci hosted the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on October 10, 1992, while doing publicity for &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;. During his monologue, in response to Sin√©ad O&#x27;Connor tearing a picture of Pope John Paul II on the previous broadcast in protest of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, he described how he wished to give her &quot;such a smack&quot;.

In 1993, Pesci made an appearance in &quot;A Bronx Tale&quot; as Carmine. The film starred Robert De Niro, who also directed, and Chazz Palminteri, who wrote the play from which the film was adapted. Both De Niro and Palminteri personally offered Pesci the role. In 1995, Pesci had his third collaboration with Scorsese and De Niro in the film &quot;Casino&quot;, playing Nicky Santoro, based on real-life Mob enforcer Anthony Spilotro, along with Sharon Stone and James Woods; Pesci had previously co-starred with the latter in &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;. During filming, Pesci broke the same rib that had been broken 15 years prior during the production of &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. In 1996, Pesci was considered to play Myron Larabee, the stressed-out postman, in &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot; opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, but the part was ultimately given to Sinbad, whose physical size was more comparable to Schwarzenegger&#x27;s.

He had starring roles in several other films, including &quot;Man on Fire&quot; (1987), &quot;The Super&quot; (1991), &quot;Jimmy Hollywood&quot; (1994), &quot;With Honors&quot; (also 1994) and &quot;Gone Fishin&#x27;&quot; (1997). Pesci&#x27;s role in &quot;With Honors&quot; was a dramatic role in which he played a homeless man living on the campus of Harvard.

===Musical===
In 1998, he released his second album and his first in 30 years, &quot;Vincent LaGuardia Gambini Sings Just for You&quot; which was named after his character from the 1992 film &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;. The album was both humorous and serious, exploring a variety of genres, though most of it was big band jazz. The album spawned the single &quot;Wise Guy&quot;, a rap number that played on the gangsta theme by making reference to Mafia gangsterism. &quot;Wise Guy&quot; interpolated the 1980 hit &quot;Rapture&quot; by Blondie, and was co-written and produced by the hip-hop production team the Trackmasters.

===Semi-retirement from acting===
In 1999, Pesci announced his retirement from acting to pursue a musical career and to enjoy life away from the camera. He returned to acting when he did a cameo in De Niro&#x27;s 2006 film &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot;. In 2010, he starred in the brothel drama &quot;Love Ranch&quot; alongside Helen Mirren.

Pesci appeared with Don Rickles, with whom he had worked in &quot;Casino&quot;, in a 2011 Snickers advertisement in which he portrays the angry alter ego of a young man who attends a party and becomes agitated by two women until he is calmed down by eating a Snickers bar.

In 2011, Pesci sued Fiore Films, the producers of the film &quot;Gotti&quot;, saying they had broken their promise to cast him in the film as real-life mobster Angelo Ruggiero. Pesci stated that he had gained for the role. He sued them for $3 million, which was the payment he had been promised. The lawsuit was settled out of court in 2013 for an unspecified sum, and the role, after many production delays, eventually went to Pruitt Taylor Vince.

Pesci appears in the 2016 music documentary &quot;Jimmy Scott: I Go Back Home,&quot; in which he is filmed recording &quot;The Folks Who Live on the Hill&quot; from Scott&#x27;s 2017 posthumous album &quot;I Go Back Home&quot;.

===Reprise for &quot;The Irishman&quot;===
In 2017, Pesci was cast alongside Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in &quot;The Irishman&quot;, a crime film directed by Martin Scorsese. Pesci was offered his role a reported 50 times before agreeing to take part, at first saying he did not want to do &quot;the gangster thing again,&quot; while Scorsese tried to persuade him &quot;The Irishman&quot; would be &quot;different.&quot; The film received a limited theatrical release on November 1, 2019, followed by digital streaming on November 27, 2019, by Netflix. Pesci&#x27;s performance as Russell Bufalino was critically acclaimed and earned him various accolades, including nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor and for two Screen Actors Guild Awards. Pesci also returned to music with his third album and his first in 21 years, titled &quot;Pesci... Still Singing&quot;, released on November 29, 2019.

==Personal life==
Pesci has been married and divorced three times. 

His first marriage was in January 1964. His second marriage was from 1988 to 1992, to Claudia Haro, a model and actress. They have one child, a daughter. In 2000, Pesci started dating Angie Everhart. They became engaged in 2007 but broke up in 2008.

<text>Lincoln University (MƒÅori: &quot;Te Whare WƒÅnaka o Aoraki&quot;) is a public university in New Zealand that was formed in 1990 when Lincoln College, Canterbury was made independent of the University of Canterbury. Founded in 1878, it is the oldest agricultural teaching institution in the Southern Hemisphere. It remains the smallest university in New Zealand (by enrolment) and one of the eight public universities. The campus is situated on of land located about outside the city of Christchurch, in Lincoln, Canterbury.

In 2018 Lincoln University had 2695 Equivalent Full Time Students (EFTS) and 633 full-time equivalent staff (188 Academic, 135 Administration and Support, 65 Research and Technical, 273 Farms and Operational).

Lincoln University is a member of the Euroleague for Life Sciences.

==History==
===School of Agriculture of Canterbury University College===

Lincoln University began life in 1878 as the School of Agriculture of Canterbury University College, opening in July 1880. By 1885 it had 56 students, 32 of them in residence, and all classes were held in the main building (later known as Ivey Hall). The teaching staff included the head of the school William Ivey (who taught agriculture), George Gray (Chemistry and Physics), who remained on staff until 1915, Eric Manley Clarke (mathematics, surveying, and book-keeping; son of the English geodesist Alexander Ross Clarke), and part-time lecturer Thomas Hill (Veterinary Science).

The college farm was worked by the students, who took part in ploughing, milking, and stock management, as well as taking lectures on agricultural science and chemistry.

===Canterbury Agricultural College===

From 1896 to 1961 it served students under the name &quot;Canterbury Agricultural College&quot;, and offered qualifications of the University of New Zealand until that institution&#x27;s demise. 

===Lincoln University===
From 1961 to 1990, it was known as &quot;Lincoln College&quot;, a constituent college of the University of Canterbury, until achieving autonomy in 1990 as Lincoln University. It is the oldest agricultural teaching institution in the Southern Hemisphere. It remains the smallest university in New Zealand.

In March 2009, the Crown Research Institute AgResearch announced that it planned to merge with Lincoln University. However, Lincoln University rejected the plan later that year over financial concerns.
On 18 November 2010, after a period of consultation, it was confirmed that a merger between Lincoln University and Telford Rural Polytechnic would go ahead, with the merger taking effect on 1 January 2011.

On 18 June 2013, a new blueprint for the Selwyn campus was announced which included the &quot;Lincoln Hub&quot; concept previously announced by the Government on 29 April 2013.

==Campuses and facilities==
* The oldest building on campus is Ivey Hall, built in 1878 as the main teaching, administration, and residential building. It was designed in the Jacobethan style by Christchurch architect Frederick Strouts. As well as lecture theatres, laboratories, and a museum, the College Director William Ivey, his family, and the students resided here. A &quot;West Wing&quot; was added in 1881 for additional student accommodation and study rooms (West Ivey was damaged in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake and remains closed). Extensively remodelled and expanded in 1989, Ivey Hall now houses the George Forbes Memorial Library.
* Memorial Hall, designed by Cecil Wood, was built in 1923‚Äì24 to commemorate the loss of former Lincoln students who died in World War I; two thirds of the costs were raised by the Old Boy&#x27;s Students&#x27; Association. It later commemorated the dead of World War II. Extensively damaged along with Ivey West in the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, it is now closed to the public and awaiting repair.
* The Laboratories were built in 1929, and became the McCaskill Building, before being replaced by the School of Landscape Architecture Building in 2009.
*The Lodge, a residence for the College Principal, was built in 1945. Until this time the Principal and his family had lived in Ivey Hall.
* The first major hall of residence on campus was Hudson Hall, named after College Principal Eric Hudson: its foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Peter Fraser in July 1949, and it opened in 1953. Hudson Hall had bed and study accommodation for 184 students. It is now largely an administration building.
* Lincoln University has six halls of residence, of which Hudson Hall is the oldest. Colombo Hall, Lowrie Hall and Stevens Hall all opened in 1970, with Centennial Hall opening in 1978, Lincoln University&#x27;s centenary year. The newest hall of residence is Southland Hall, built in 1993.
* The George Forbes Building, named after former Prime Minister George Forbes, began construction in 1957 and opened in 1960. This was the college&#x27;s first purpose-built library, housing 10,000 books. Over the years the library expanded, and the present high-rise building was constructed in 1975. The library eventually outgrew the Forbes Building, and the George Forbes Memorial Library has been housed in Ivey Hall since 1989.
* Gillespie Hall, also known as the Student Union or Lincoln Union, consists of three buildings (Union, Annex, and Link) designed and built between 1962 and 1988. It was named after former Chairman William Gillespie, who had died in 1960. After the 2010 earthquake it was considered earthquake prone, and has been closed since 2010.

* The Hilgendorf Building, constructed in 1968, was designed by Trengrove, Trengrove and Marshall Architects (now Totem Studio Architects) to cater to 550 full-time students. Named after early Lincoln lecturer Frederick William Hilgendorf, it was a concrete brutalist building, and was badly damaged in the 2010 earthquake and closed for repair. After engineering testing it was deemed unsalvageable and was demolished in 2015.
* The Hilgendorf&#x27;s companion, the Burns Building, was constructed in a similar style, and the complex of two buildings with their lecture theatres and computer centre were often referred to as the Hilgendorf Wing and Burns Wing. Named after past Principal Malcolm Burns, Burns opened in 1976.
* The Stewart Building, which opened in 1990, is named after another past Principal, James D. Stewart. With two large lecture theatres each seating several hundred, its computerised teaching aids and audiovisual capacity were considered cutting-edge for New Zealand in 1990.
* Built in 1990 to provide lecture and seminar space for a rapidly-increasing intake of Commerce students, the Commerce Building sits on what was the Ivey Hall gardens.
* The cafe and dining hall Mrs O&#x27;s was built in 2011 to incorporate the original dining hall building, then redesigned for earthquake safety and reopened in 2014. It is named after Mrs Joan O&#x27;Loughlin, one of Lincoln College&#x27;s longest-serving staff (1966‚Äì1998), a cleaner and tea attendant much-loved by students.

The problem assumes that the two bodies are point particles that interact only with one another; the only force affecting each object arises from the other one, and all other objects are ignored.

The most prominent example of the classical two-body problem is the gravitational case (see also Kepler problem), arising in astronomy for predicting the orbits (or escapes from orbit) of objects such as satellites, planets, and stars. A two-point-particle model of such a system nearly always describes its behavior well enough to provide useful insights and predictions.

A simpler &quot;one body&quot; model, the &quot;central-force problem&quot;, treats one object as the immobile source of a force acting on the other. One then seeks to predict the motion of the single remaining mobile object. Such an approximation can give useful results when one object is much more massive than the other (as with a light planet orbiting a heavy star, where the star can be treated as essentially stationary).

However, the one-body approximation is usually unnecessary except as a stepping stone. For many forces, including gravitational ones, the general version of the two-body problem can be reduced to a pair of one-body problems, allowing it to be solved completely, and giving a solution simple enough to be used effectively.

By contrast, the three-body problem (and, more generally, the &quot;n&quot;-body problem for &quot;n&quot;¬†‚â•¬†3) cannot be solved in terms of first integrals, except in special cases.

== Results for prominent cases ==

=== Gravitation and other inverse-square examples ===

The two-body problem is interesting in astronomy because pairs of astronomical objects are often moving rapidly in arbitrary directions (so their motions become interesting), widely separated from one another (so they will not collide) and even more widely separated from other objects (so outside influences will be small enough to be ignored safely).

Under the force of gravity, each member of a pair of such objects will orbit their mutual center of mass in an elliptical pattern, unless they are moving fast enough to escape one another entirely, in which case their paths will diverge along other planar conic sections. If one object is very much heavier than the other, it will move far less than the other with reference to the shared center of mass. The mutual center of mass may even be inside the larger object.

For the derivation of the solutions to the problem, see Classical central-force problem or Kepler problem.

In principle, the same solutions apply to macroscopic problems involving objects interacting not only through gravity, but through any other attractive scalar force field obeying an inverse-square law, with electrostatic attraction being the obvious physical example. In practice, such problems rarely arise. Except perhaps in experimental apparatus or other specialized equipment, we rarely encounter electrostatically interacting objects which are moving fast enough, and in such a direction, as to avoid colliding, and/or which are isolated enough from their surroundings.

The dynamical system of a two-body system under the influence of torque turns out to be a Sturm-Liouville equation.

=== Inapplicability to atoms and subatomic particles ===

Although the two-body model treats the objects as point particles, classical mechanics only apply to systems of macroscopic scale. Most behavior of subatomic particles &quot;cannot&quot; be predicted under the classical assumptions underlying this article or using the mathematics here.

Electrons in an atom are sometimes described as &quot;orbiting&quot; its nucleus, following an early conjecture of Niels Bohr (this is the source of the term &quot;orbital&quot;). However, electrons don&#x27;t actually orbit nuclei in any meaningful sense, and quantum mechanics are necessary for any useful understanding of the electron&#x27;s real behavior. Solving the classical two-body problem for an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus is misleading and does not produce many useful insights.

== Reduction to two independent, one-body problems ==


The complete two-body problem can be solved by re-formulating it as two one-body problems: a trivial one and one that involves solving for the motion of one particle in an external potential. Since many one-body problems can be solved exactly, the corresponding two-body problem can also be solved.

Let and be the vector positions of the two bodies, and &quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;m&quot;2 be their masses. The goal is to determine the trajectories and for all times &quot;t&quot;, given the initial positions and and the initial velocities and .

When applied to the two masses, Newton&#x27;s second law states that
_{1} &lt;/math&gt;|Equation }}
_{2} &lt;/math&gt;|Equation }}

where F12 is the force on mass 1 due to its interactions with mass 2, and F21 is the force on mass 2 due to its interactions with mass 1. The two dots on top of the x position vectors denote their second derivative with respect to time, or their acceleration vectors.

Adding and subtracting these two equations decouples them into two one-body problems, which can be solved independently. &quot;Adding&quot; equations (1) and () results in an equation describing the center of mass (barycenter) motion. By contrast, &quot;subtracting&quot; equation (2) from equation (1) results in an equation that describes how the vector between the masses changes with time. The solutions of these independent one-body problems can be combined to obtain the solutions for the trajectories and .

=== Center of mass motion (1st one-body problem) ===

Let formula_1 be the position of the center of mass (barycenter) of the system. Addition of the force equations (1) and (2) yields
formula_2
where we have used Newton&#x27;s third law and where
formula_3

The resulting equation:
formula_4
shows that the velocity formula_5 of the center of mass is constant, from which follows that the total momentum is also constant (conservation of momentum). Hence, the position of the center of mass can be determined at all times from the initial positions and velocities.

===Displacement vector motion (2nd one-body problem)===
Dividing both force equations by the respective masses, subtracting the second equation from the first, and rearranging gives the equation
formula_6
where we have again used Newton&#x27;s third law and where is the displacement vector from mass 2 to mass 1, as defined above.

The force between the two objects, which originates in the two objects, should only be a function of their separation and not of their absolute positions and ; otherwise, there would not be translational symmetry, and the laws of physics would have to change from place to place. The subtracted equation can therefore be written:
formula_7
where formula_8 is the reduced mass
formula_9

Solving the equation for is the key to the two-body problem. The solution depends on the specific force between the bodies, which is defined by formula_10. For the case where formula_10 follows an inverse-square law, see the Kepler problem.

Once and have been determined, the original trajectories may be obtained
formula_12
formula_13
as may be verified by substituting the definitions of R and r into the right-hand sides of these two equations.

== Two-body motion is planar ==

The motion of two bodies with respect to each other always lies in a plane (in the center of mass frame).

Proof: Defining the linear momentum and the angular momentum of the system, with respect to the center of mass, by the equations
formula_14

where is the reduced mass and is the relative position (with these written taking the center of mass as the origin, and thus both parallel to ) the rate of change of the angular momentum equals the net torque 
formula_15
and using the property of the vector cross product that for any vectors and pointing in the same direction,

formula_16
with .

Introducing the assumption (true of most physical forces, as they obey Newton&#x27;s strong third law of motion) that the force between two particles acts along the line between their positions, it follows that and the angular momentum vector is constant (conserved). Therefore, the displacement vector and its velocity are always in the plane perpendicular to the constant vector .

== Energy of the two-body system ==

If the force is conservative then the system has a potential energy , so the total energy can be written as
formula_17

In the center of mass frame the kinetic energy is the lowest and the total energy becomes
formula_18
The coordinates and can be expressed as
formula_19
formula_20 
and in a similar way the energy &quot;E&quot; is related to the energies and that separately contain the kinetic energy of each body: 
formula_21

== Central forces ==
For many physical problems, the force is a central force, i.e., it is of the form
formula_22
where and is the corresponding unit vector. We now have:
formula_23
where is negative in the case of an attractive force.

<doc id="277469" wikidata="Q6811885" url="?curid=277469" title="Spring Racing Carnival">
<text>The Spring Racing Carnival is the name of an Australian Thoroughbred horse racing series held annually in Melbourne during October and November.

==The Carnival and its status in the wider community==
Although racing in Australia is held every day except Good Friday and Christmas Day, the Group One races in Melbourne are held almost exclusively throughout the carnival, which is traditionally placed between the football and cricket seasons. During the winter (where football is dominant), and summer (where cricket is dominant), racing takes a &#x27;back seat&#x27; position in relation to the cricket or football in terms of media coverage and attendances. However, in spring and autumn, the mass media turns its attention to the racing. There is also an Autumn Racing Carnival, a time where Group One races are also held.

==Economic impact==
The Spring Racing Carnival is a major contributor to the Victorian economy. According to a study conducted by market research company IER, the 2022 Spring Racing Carnival was estimated to have delivered $422.1 million in gross economic benefit to Victoria in 2022, with the Spring Racing Carnival contributing more than $3.6 billion in gross economic benefit to Victoria in the past decade, almost $1 billion more than the Australian Open tennis reported for the same period. 

The 2017 Spring Racing Carnival injected $444.5 million into the Victorian economy, and created jobs for more than 20,000 staff and contractors, in addition to providing boosts to the retail and hospitality sectors. 

The 2018 Spring Racing Carnival provided an economic return to the state of $447.6 million, with the event also directly employing more than 21,000 staff and contractors who worked for more than 800 companies in the lead-up and during the event.

The 2019 Spring Racing Carnival has been credited with injecting US$196.2 million directly into the Victorian economy; when considering total spending by all attendees at the Spring Racing Carnival, the event generated a gross economic benefit of US$521.8 million.

==Attendance==
==Sweeps==
The carnival, and particularly the Melbourne Cup attracts the interest of many people otherwise uninterested in horse racing, and special forms of very low-stake gambling are often used for this event. One common form for groups such as office staff is the &quot;sweep&quot;, where each participant adds a small fee to a &quot;pot&quot; and draws the name of a horse like a raffle. Prize money is distributed to the person who draws the winning horse (occasionally smaller prizes are awarded to placegetters and the last-placing horse). A more complex and high-stakes form of the sweep is the &quot;Calcutta&quot;, often held as a fundraising event for community organisations, which begins as in the sweep (though usually with a much higher initial stake), but which allows ticket holders to trade their tickets through an auction system.

==Special guests==
For the fashion part of the Spring Racing Carnival many special guests over the years have come to the races.
Paris Hilton, Nicky Hilton, Carson Kressley, Eva Longoria, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Naomi Campbell, Nicole Kidman, Gigi Hadid and Hilary Swank.

==Carnival race meetings==
The Spring Racing Carnival is made up of meetings held by the metropolitan clubs, where Group One races take place, and also at Geelong and Bendigo. With numerous group races during August and September at metropolitan tracks Flemington, Caulfield and Moonee Valley, the Spring Racing Carnival officially starts on the Group 1 Turnbull Stakes Day at Flemington, one week after the AFL Grand Final. The Spring Racing Carnival officially ends on the final day of the carnival at Sandown in mid-November.

===Caulfield Carnival===

The Melbourne Racing Club holds three race meetings at Caulfield Racecourse, each with major Group one races.
* The Caulfield Guineas, Caulfield Thousand Guineas and Caulfield Stakes is held on the Saturday three weeks before the Victoria Derby. Other group races are held on this day, including the Toorak Handicap and Herbert Power Stakes.
* The Ladies Day Vase and Blue Sapphire Stakes are held on the Wednesday following the Saturday Caulfield Guineas.
* The Caulfield Cup is held on the Saturday on the weekend following the Guineas meeting.

===Geelong Carnival===

The Geelong Racing Club hosts its Group 3 Geelong Cup at the Geelong Racecourse on the Wednesday between the Caulfield Cup and Cox Plate. The meeting also has a couple of Listed races, The 3YO Geelong Classic and The Rosemont Stud Stakes. The day is a public holiday in Geelong&#x27;s metropolitan area.

===Moonee Valley Carnival===
The Moonee Valley Racing Club holds a two-day carnival at the Moonee Valley Racecourse. The Manikato Stakes is held on the Friday night following the Caulfield Cup. 
The club&#x27;s highlight is the Weight for Age Cox Plate race held on the next day with a host of other Group races including the Moonee Valley Gold Cup, Crystal Mile and Moonee Valley Vase.

===Bendigo Carnival===

The Bendigo Jockey Club hosts its Group 3 Bendigo Cup on the Wednesday between the Cox Plate and the VRC Derby Day.

===Melbourne Cup Carnival===

The Victoria Racing Club&#x27;s meetings attract the most attention from the media and the wider community.
* The Victoria Derby is held on the Saturday before the Melbourne Cup. It is a set-weights race for three-year-old horses. Other well known races on this day include the Cantala Stakes, Empire Rose Stakes and Hotham Handicap (the winner of this receiving a final spot in the Melbourne Cup field). Traditionally, the Melbourne Cup field is announced following the conclusion of the last race on this day.
* The Melbourne Cup handicap race is held on the first Tuesday in November, and is a public holiday in Melbourne, but the Cup is witnessed by those all around Australia as well as internationally.
* The VRC Oaks race is held on the Thursday following the Cup. It is a three-year-old fillies race, and traditionally the race meeting has been known as &#x27;ladies&#x27; day&#x27;.
* The Mackinnon Stakes is held on the Saturday following the Oaks, and traditionally it has been known as &#x27;family day&#x27;. Other notable races run on this day are the VRC Sprint Classic and VRC Queen Elizabeth Stakes.

===Sandown Carnival===

The Melbourne Racing Club holds the last official meeting of the Spring Racing Carnival at Sandown Racecourse. This day includes the Group 2 Sandown Guineas and the Group 2 Zipping Classic and occurs in mid November, one week after Mackinnon Stakes day.

<text>The semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) is a very small shorebird. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific &quot;pusilla&quot; is Latin for &quot;very small&quot;.

It is sometimes separated with other &quot;stints&quot; in &quot;Erolia,&quot; but, although these apparently form a monophyletic group, the present species&#x27; old genus &quot;Ereunetes&quot; had been proposed before &quot;Erolia&quot;.

==Description==
It is a small sandpiper, 15‚Äì18¬†cm (5.9-7.1¬†in) long and weighing around 18-51.5¬†g (0.6-1.8¬†oz). Wingspan ranges from 13.8 to 14.6 in (35-37¬†cm). Adults have black legs and a short, stout, straight dark bill. The body is dark grey-brown on top and white underneath. The head and neck are tinged light grey-brown. This bird can be difficult to distinguish from other similar tiny shorebirds, in particular the western sandpiper; these are known collectively as &quot;peeps&quot; or &quot;stints&quot;.

==Breeding and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is the southern tundra in Canada and Alaska near water. They nest on the ground. The male makes several shallow scrapes; the female chooses one and adds grass and other material to line the nest. The female lays 4 eggs; the male assists in incubation. After a few days, the female leaves the young with the male; the young feed themselves.

These birds forage on mudflats, picking up food by sight and feel (bill). They mainly eat aquatic insects and their larvae, spiders, snails, worms and crustaceans. Semipalmated sandpipers rely heavily on horseshoe crab eggs during spring migration. Females will also eat small mammal bones as an extra source of calcium during egg laying.

==Status and migration==
They are long distance migrants and winter in coastal South America, with some going to the southern United States and the Caribbean. They migrate in flocks which can number in the hundreds of thousands, particularly in favoured feeding locations such as the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay. This species is a rare but regular vagrant to western Europe.

Although very numerous, these birds are highly dependent on a few key stopover habitats during their migration, notably Mary&#x27;s Point and Johnson&#x27;s Mills along Shepody Bay, an arm of the Bay of Fundy. During the months of July and August, the Nature Conservancy of Canada runs an information center about these shorebirds in Johnson&#x27;s Mills, New Brunswick.

<doc id="277479" wikidata="Q254689" url="?curid=277479" title="Magnum, P.I.">
<text>Magnum, P.I. is an American crime drama television series starring Tom Selleck as Thomas Magnum, a private investigator (P.I.) living on Oahu, Hawaii. The series ran from December 11, 1980, to May 1, 1988, during its first-run broadcast on the American television network CBS. &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; consistently ranked in the top 20 U.S. television programs in the Nielsen ratings during the first five years of its original run, finishing as high as number three for the 1982‚Äì83 season. The series entered syndication in 1986 under the title Magnum in order to differentiate reruns from new episodes still airing under the original title on CBS.

A remake series of the same name was ordered to series on May 11, 2018, and premiered on September 24, 2018, on CBS.

==Premise==
Thomas Sullivan Magnum IV is a private investigator played by Tom Selleck. He lives in the guesthouse of a beachfront estate called Robin&#x27;s Nest, in Hawaii, at the invitation of its owner, Robin Masters. Ostensibly this is &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for Magnum&#x27;s services based upon his expertise in security; the pilot and several early episodes suggest Magnum had done Masters a favor of some kind, possibly when Masters hired him for a case. Masters is rarely depicted and is the celebrated author of several dozen lurid novels. His voice, heard only in five episodes, was provided by Orson Welles (one last appearance was provided by a different actor, Red Crandell).

Magnum lives a luxurious life on the estate and operates as a P.I. on cases that suit him. The only thorn in the side of his near-perfect lifestyle is Jonathan Quayle Higgins III, played by John Hillerman. An ex-British Army regimental sergeant major, he is on the surface a stern, by-the-book caretaker of Robin&#x27;s Nest, whose strict ways often conflict with Magnum&#x27;s more easygoing methods. He patrols Robin&#x27;s Nest with his two highly-trained &quot;lads&quot;, Dobermanns named Zeus and Apollo. Magnum has free use of the guesthouse and the car, a Ferrari 308 GTS Quattrovalvole, but as a humorous aside in various episodes, often has to bargain with Higgins for use of estate amenities such as the tennis courts, wine cellar, and expensive cameras.

The relationship between Magnum and Higgins is initially cool, but as the series progresses, an unspoken respect and fondness of sorts grows between them. Many episodes dedicate more screen time to this &quot;odd couple&quot; pairing after the relationship proved popular with fans. A recurrent theme throughout the last two seasons, starting in the episode &quot;Paper War&quot;, involves Magnum&#x27;s sneaking suspicion that Higgins is actually Masters, since he opens Masters&#x27;s mail, calls Masters&#x27;s Ferrari &quot;my car&quot;, etc. This suspicion is neither proved nor disproved, although in at least one episode Higgins is shown alone in a room, picking up a ringing phone and talking to Masters, indicating they are different people.

Aside from Higgins, Magnum&#x27;s two main companions on the islands are Theodore &quot;T.C.&quot; Calvin (Roger E. Mosley), who runs a one-person local helicopter charter and tour van service, &quot;Island Hoppers&quot;, and often finds himself persuaded by Magnum to fly him during various cases, and Orville Wilbur Richard &quot;Rick&quot; Wright (Larry Manetti), who refuses to use his Wright brothers-esque given name of Orville and owns a local bar. In the pilot episode, this was &quot;Rick&#x27;s Cafe Americain&quot;, inspired by &quot;Casablanca&quot;, with Rick appearing in suitable 1930s attire. After completing the pilot, though, executives felt that audiences would be unable to fully connect with this element. Instead, Rick moved to running the plush, beachside King Kamehameha Club, which has exclusive membership and Higgins on the board of directors. Magnum often strolls around the club, using its facilities and running up an ever-unpaid tab, further fueling the Magnum-Higgins feud. T.C. and Rick are both former Marines from VMO-2 with whom Magnum, a former member of the United States Navy SEALs and Naval Intelligence officer, served in the Vietnam War. The series was one of the first to deal with Vietnam veterans as &quot;human beings&quot; and not as shell-shocked killers, and was praised by many ex-servicemen groups for doing so. Magnum often dupes or bribes T.C. and Rick into aiding him on his cases, much to their frustration. T.C., whose assistance often involves the use of his helicopter, often tells Magnum, &quot;gas money. All I need is gas money&quot;, referring to the high cost of the helicopter&#x27;s fuel.

Magnum comes and goes as he pleases, works only when he wants, and has almost unlimited use of the Ferrari and many other luxuries of the estate. He keeps a mini-refrigerator with a seemingly endless supply of beer (&quot;altbier&quot;), wears his father&#x27;s treasured Rolex GMT Master wristwatch, and is surrounded by countless beautiful women, who are often victims of crime, his clients, or otherwise connected to the cases he solves.

Other characteristics specific to Magnum are his thick moustache, baseball caps (usually a Detroit Tigers or VMO-2 cap), a rubber chicken, and a variety of colorful Aloha shirts. Nearly every episode is narrated, in voice-over, by Magnum at various points. At the end of the seventh season, Magnum was to be killed off, to end the series. Following an outcry from fans who demanded a more satisfactory conclusion, an eighth season was produced to bring Magnum &quot;back to life&quot; and round off the series.

==Setting==
Robin&#x27;s Nest () is the fictional beach front estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, which serves as the residence of the main characters. In the series, it is owned by renowned novelist Robin Masters, who employs Jonathan Higgins as the estate&#x27;s caretaker and Thomas Magnum as its security expert. Higgins resides in the estate&#x27;s main house while Magnum occupies the guest house.

In reality, the beachfront property was on Oahu&#x27;s east shore at 41-505 Hawaii Route 72, near Waimanalo Beach, Hawaii (). Designed by American architect Louis Davis and called &quot;Pahonu&quot; (&quot;turtle enclosure&quot; in Hawaiian), it was also known as &quot;The Anderson Estate&quot; after its longtime owner, politician Eve G. Anderson. The grounds were used for hundreds of years to raise green sea turtles for the Hawaiian royal family and include a 500-by-50-foot stone wall that surrounds the former turtle-raising pond. Since 1978, the turtle pond has been on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii. A residential estate since the early 1930s, comprising an main house, a boathouse (which in the series appears as the guesthouse Magnum occupies), a gatehouse, and private tennis court.

Owned in January 2014 by Cox Communications heiress Barbara Cox Anthony, it was placed on the market with Sotheby&#x27;s for $15.75 million and sold for $8.7 million in March 2015. In April 2018, the estate was demolished by its new owner former President Barack Obama.

Many of the indoor scenes of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; were filmed on the old &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; soundstage, as the network did not wish for its Hawaiian production facilities to go to waste after &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; ended its run.

Through the years, fans of the show have noted commonalities in the settings of time and space (the so-called fictional TV universe) between &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; and &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. For example, in Season 1, Episode 5, &quot;Thank Heavens for Little Girls, and Big Ones Too&quot;, Higgins calls Five-O to report a theft. In Season 1, Episode 6, &quot;Skin Deep&quot;, Magnum gets on the radio pretending he&#x27;s with the police and asks: &quot;Billy, this is McGarrett of Five-O. Is David Norman armed?&quot; The producers of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; unsuccessfully attempted to convince Jack Lord to make a cameo.

In a 2013 episode of the &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; remake, the characters &quot;sing&quot; the &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; theme song while discussing which person most resembled the characters on that program. The purported connection between the programs appears to be preserved in the remakes, as explained by their creators in TV Guide, where plans for a crossover were announced as well as acknowledgment of the coexistence of Magnum with Hawaii Five-0 in the same TV universe. A Hawaii Five-0 and Magnum P.I. crossover event aired on CBS in January 2020, with the Hawaii Five-0 episode &quot;Ihea &#x27;oe i ka wa a ka ua e loku ana?&quot; (Hawaiian for &quot;Where were you when the rain was pouring?&quot;) followed by the Magnum P.I. episode &quot;Desperate Measures&quot;.

== Theme music ==
The original theme music for the opening credits of the pilot episode was a mid-tempo jazzy piece by Ian Freebairn-Smith. This music was also used for the next nine regular episodes.

Beginning in Episode 12, it was replaced by a more up tempo theme typical of 1980s action series by Mike Post and Pete Carpenter with guitar by Larry Carlton. This theme had been used during the show and over the closing credits from Episode 8. A longer version of this second theme (&quot;Theme from Magnum P.I.&quot;, 3:25 in duration) credited to Post was released as a single by Elektra Records in 1982 and featured on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart that same year, peaking at No. 25 on May 8, 1982. This version also appeared on Post&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Television Theme Songs&quot;.

==Development and production ==

Development of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; was originally slated at ABC, which aired other Glen A. Larson series &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot; (1977‚Äì1979) and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; (1978‚Äì1979). In January 1979, ABC cancelled both series, and development on &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; Larson then took the series over to CBS.

Selleck&#x27;s contract commitment to the &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; series famously cost him the role of Indiana Jones in the first &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), which went to Harrison Ford. Selleck was unable to take the part of Jones as &quot;Magnum&quot; was due to start filming in March 1980. Owing to the 1980 AFTRA/Screen Actors Guild strike, production of &quot;Magnum&quot; was delayed until December 1980, which would have allowed Selleck to play Jones.

In the 1986‚Äì87 season 7 of &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, Selleck was brought in as a producer and the program was moved from its Thursday night slot on CBS to Wednesday, which increased its slumping ratings from competing with &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1984‚Äì1992) on NBC.

==Episodes==

===Crossovers===

* &quot;Ki&#x27;is Don&#x27;t Lie&quot; ‚Äî Magnum works with the Simon brothers to recover a stolen Hawaiian artifact that&#x27;s supposedly cursed. The plot concludes on &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; in the episode &quot;Emeralds Are Not a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;.
* &quot;Novel Connection&quot; ‚Äî Jessica Fletcher comes to Hawaii when an attempt is made on the lives of Robin&#x27;s guests. The plot concludes on &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in the episode &quot;Magnum on Ice&quot;.

For re-run and overseas purposes, the first half of these crossovers (the &quot;Magnum&quot; episode) also had alternate endings filmed, which wrapped the story up in a single episode and so allowed repeat showings as &quot;stand-alone&quot; stories rather than two-part crossovers.

One mooted crossover from later in the series&#x27; run was with the CBS vigilantism drama &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, starring Edward Woodward as the retired spy Robert McCall. According to &quot;Equalizer&quot; executive producer Coleman Luck, interviewed for a special-feature documentary on &quot;The Equalizer&quot;, the crossover was proposed by Universal Television and was opposed by the &quot;Equalizer&quot; production staff.

In 1992, three years after the conclusion of &quot;Magnum,&quot; a script was written for a potential crossover with Donald P. Bellisario&#x27;s next show, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Quantum Leap,&quot; in which Dr. Sam Beckett (Scott Bakula) would &quot;leap&quot; into the body of Thomas Magnum. It is unknown whether any original cast members from &quot;Magnum&quot; were slated to appear in the episode or how far production had progressed, though test footage does exist of the attempted recreation of Tom Selleck&#x27;s famous fourth-wall breaking &quot;eyebrow&quot; shot from the opening credits with Bakula in the role.

Bellisario received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Episode in a TV Series.

===Golden Globe Awards===
&quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; was nominated for multiple Golden Globe Awards:

===Primetime Emmy Awards===
===Other awards===
==Detroit Tigers incident==
On September 16, 2017, a group of 45 men dressed as Thomas Magnum were ejected from a Detroit Tigers game for smoking and catcalling women in the park.
The story quickly became one of international interest as the group, from nearby Allen Park, Michigan gave dozens of interviews to newspapers, magazines, radio stations, podcasts and more.

==Proposed sequels==
In October 2013, Selleck said Tom Clancy had planned to write a screenplay for a &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; film in the 1990s, with Universal Pictures interested in producing it. However, the project never materialized.

In September 2016, ABC began developing a sequel from &quot;Leverage&quot; creator John Rogers and producer Eva Longoria centering on Lily &quot;Tommy&quot; Magnum, which never made it to series.

==Remake==

In October 2017, CBS announced they had issued a pilot commitment for a remake of the series, to be developed by Peter M. Lenkov, who has helped remake other series like &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; and &quot;MacGyver&quot; for the network. CBS officially ordered the pilot three months later, along with one for a reboot of another hit 1980s television series for the network, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;, as well as one for 1990s favorite &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;.
On February 20, 2018, actor Jay Hernandez was cast as Thomas Magnum.

<text>Adkins v. Children&#x27;s Hospital, 261 U.S. 525 (1923), is a United States Supreme Court opinion that federal minimum wage legislation for women was an unconstitutional infringement of liberty of contract, as protected by the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

&quot;Adkins&quot; was overturned in &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot;.

==Facts==
In 1918, Congress passed a law to set minimum wages for women and children in the District of Columbia. As in other cases, the question was one of balancing the police power of Congress to regulate working and living conditions with the right of individuals to conduct their own affairs without legislative interference. Children&#x27;s Hospital and a female elevator operator at a hotel brought the case to prevent enforcement of the act by Jesse C. Adkins and the two other members of a wage board.

==Judgment==

The Court&#x27;s decision, by Justice Sutherland, was that previous decisions (&quot;Muller v. Oregon&quot;, 208 U.S. 412 (1908) and &quot;Bunting v. Oregon&quot;, 243 U.S. 426 (1917)) did not overrule the holding in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;, 198 U.S. 45 (1905), which protected freedom of contract. The previous decisions, he noted, addressed maximum hours. The present case addressed a minimum wage. The maximum-hour laws left the parties free to negotiate about wages, unlike the present law, which restricted the employer&#x27;s side of the negotiation. The Court argued that if legislatures were permitted to set minimum wage laws, they would be permitted to set maximum wage laws. Sutherland asserted: 

Sutherland cited the changes that had occurred in the years since &quot;Muller&quot;, particularly the Nineteenth Amendment, which guaranteed the right to vote for women. He notes that &quot;Muller&quot; and other cases had emphasized differences between men and women as justifying special protection for women, but &quot;[in] view of the great‚Äînot to say revolutionary‚Äîchanges which have taken place since [&quot;Muller&quot;], in the contractual, political, and civil status of women, culminating in the Nineteenth Amendment, it is not unreasonable to say that these differences have now come almost, if not quite, to the vanishing point.&quot;

==Dissents==
===Taft===

Chief Justice Taft, dissenting, argued that there was no distinction between minimum wage laws and maximum hour laws since both were essentially restrictions on contract. He noted that &quot;Lochner&quot;‚Ä≥s limitations seemed to have been overruled in &quot;Muller&quot; and &quot;Bunting&quot;.

===Holmes===
Justice Holmes, also dissenting, noted that there were many other constraints on contract (such as blue laws and usury laws). He cited the standard that he had put forth in &quot;Lochner&quot;: if a reasonable person could see a power in the Constitution, the Court should defer to legislation that used such a power.

<text>16VSB is an abbreviation for 16-level vestigial sideband modulation, capable of transmitting four bits (24=16) at a time.

==How it works==
Other slower but more rugged forms of VSB include 2VSB, 4VSB, and 8VSB. 16VSB is capable of twice the data capacity of 8VSB; while 8VSB delivers 19.39¬†Mbit/s (Megabits per second) in a 6-MHz television channel, 16VSB could deliver 38.78¬†Mbit/s, while making the sacrifice of being more prone to transmission error.

==History==
While 8VSB is the ATSC digital broadcast modulation format, 16VSB was planned for cable distribution. 16VSB is about twice as susceptible to noise, therefore less suitable than 8VSB for broadcast, but well suited to the signal-to-noise ratio of hybrid fiber-coax distribution, allowing twice as much programming in a 6-MHz channel.

==Technological obsolescence==
As of 2007, a majority of cable companies have chosen to extend their existing quadrature amplitude modulation-based systems to carry digital television rather than adopting any form of VSB. It is probable that 16VSB has been replaced by &quot;Digital Transmission Standard For Cable Television&quot; a cable standard that defines 64QAM and 256QAM transmission for digital cable.

<doc id="277502" wikidata="Q898735" url="?curid=277502" title="Collodion">
<text>Collodion is a flammable, syrupy solution of nitrocellulose in ether and alcohol. There are two basic types: flexible and non-flexible. The flexible type is often used as a surgical dressing or to hold dressings in place. When painted on the skin, collodion dries to form a flexible nitrocellulose film. While it is initially colorless, it discolors over time. Non-flexible collodion is often used in theatrical make-up. Collodion was also the basis of most wet-plate photography until it was superseded by modern gelatin emulsions.

==History==
In 1846, Louis-Nicolas M√©nard and Flor√®s Domonte discovered that cellulose nitrate could be dissolved in ether. They devised a mixture of ether as the solvent and ethanol as a diluent that rendered cellulose nitrate into a clear gelatinous liquid. Collodion was first used medically as a dressing in 1847 by the Boston physician John Parker Maynard. The solution was dubbed &quot;collodion&quot; (from the Greek Œ∫ŒøŒªŒªœéŒ¥Œ∑œÇ (&quot;kollodis&quot;), gluey) by Augustus Addison Gould of Boston, Massachusetts.

==Wet-plate collodion photography==

In 1851, Frederick Scott Archer, an Englishman, discovered that collodion could be used as an alternative to egg white (albumen) on glass photographic plates. Collodion reduced the exposure time necessary for making an image. This method became known as the &#x27;wet-plate collodion&#x27; or &#x27;wet collodion&#x27; method. Collodion was relatively grainless and colorless, and allowed for one of the first high-quality duplication processes, also known as negatives. This process also produced two types of positives: the ambrotype and the tintype (also known as ferrotype).

The process required great skill and included the following steps:
* Clean the glass plate (extremely well)
* In the light, pour &quot;salted&quot; (iodide, bromide) collodion onto the glass plate, tilting it so it reaches each corner. The excess is poured back into the bottle.
* Take the plate into a darkroom or orange tent (the plate is sensitive only to blue light) and immerse the plate in a silver nitrate sensitising bath (for 3‚Äì5 minutes)
* Lift the plate out of the bath, drain and wipe the back, load it into a plate holder and protect from light with a dark slide.
* Load the plate holder into the camera, withdraw the dark slide and expose the plate (can range from less than a second to several minutes)
* Develop the plate (using a ferrous sulfate based developer)
* Fix the plate (with potassium cyanide or sodium thiosulfate)

All of this was done in a matter of minutes, and some of the steps in (red) safelight conditions, which meant that the photographer had to carry the chemicals and a portable darkroom with him wherever he went. After these steps the plate needed rinsing in fresh water. Finally, the plate was dried and varnished using a varnish made from sandarac, alcohol and lavender oil.

Dark tents to be used outdoors consisted of a small tent that was tied around the photographer&#x27;s waist. Otherwise a wheelbarrow or a horse and covered wagon were used.

==Dry collodion plates==

Richard Hill Norris, a doctor of medicine and professor of physiology at Queen&#x27;s College, Birmingham (a predecessor college of Birmingham University), is generally credited with the first development of dry collodion plate when in 1856 he took out a new patent for a dry plate used in photography in which the emulsion was coated with gelatine or gum arabic to preserve its sensitivity. Another method, using tannin, invented by Major C. Russell in 1861, followed and in 1864 W.E. Bolton and E.J. Sayce mixed silver bromide with collodion, so that by the mid-1860s the wet-plate process was being replaced.

==Medical==
* Many wart-remover preparations consist of acetic acid and salicylic acid in an acetone collodion base used in the treatment of warts by keratolysis.
* Nitrocellulose (pyroxylin) solution is also used in liquid bandage products. 
* EEG electrodes are commonly attached to the patient&#x27;s scalp with rigid collodion for long-term treatment

==Other uses==
* Non-flexible collodion is used in theatrical makeup for various effects. When applied to the skin, it shrinks as the solvent (usually ether or alcohol) evaporates, causing wrinkles and is used to simulate old age, or scars.
* Collodion is used in the cleaning of optics such as telescope mirrors. The collodion is applied to the surface of the optic, usually in two or more layers. Sometimes a piece of thin cloth is applied between the layers, to hold the collodion together for easy removal. After the collodion dries and forms a solid sheet covering the optic, it is carefully peeled away, taking contamination with it.
* Collodion is a pure type of pyroxylin used to embed specimens which will be examined under a microscope.
* While in Paris, Ren√© Dagron became familiar with the collodion wet plate and collodion-albumen dry plate processes which he would later adapt to his microfilm and Stanhope production techniques.
* Collodion was used by Alfred Nobel in his development of blasting gelatin, a more powerful, flexible, and water resistant variation of his already-successful dynamite.
* Some types of nail polish also contain collodion.

<doc id="277508" wikidata="Q629606" url="?curid=277508" title="Collective trade mark">
<text>A collective trademark, collective trade mark, or collective mark is a trademark owned by an organization (such as an association), used by its members to identify themselves with a level of quality or accuracy, geographical origin, or other characteristics set by the organization.

Collective trademarks are exceptions to the underlying principle of trademarks in that most trademarks serve as &quot;badges of origin&quot;; they indicate the individual source of the goods or services. A collective trademark, however, can be used by a variety of traders, rather than just one individual concern, provided that the trader belongs to the association.

Collective trademarks differ from certification marks. The main difference is that collective trademarks may be used by particular members of the organization which owns them, while certification marks may be used by anybody who complies with the standards defined by the owner of the particular certification mark. All these factors are being completely at the level of intellectual property.

== Regulations on use ==
National trademark laws in some countries (such as Finland, Germany, Hungary and Switzerland) provide for the filing of the regulations as an additional requirement for registration of the collective trademark.

The regulations shall normally specify: 
* the name and seat of the organization, 
* information on the members authorized to use the collective trademark, including their names, addresses and seats, 
* the conditions of membership, 
* the conditions of use of the collective trademark, 
* the prescriptions relating to the control of the use of the collective trademark, 
* the order of proceedings against unauthorized use of the collective trademark.

The main purpose of the regulations is to protect consumers against misleading practices.

== International treaties ==
Many jurisdictions have been required to amend their trademark legislation in order to accommodate the requirement of protection of collective marks under TRIPs. Art. 7 &quot;bis&quot; of the Paris Convention also requires signatories &quot;to accept for filing and to protect collective marks belonging to associations the existence of which is not contrary to the law of the country of origin, even if such organizations do not possess an industrial or commercial establishment.&quot;

== Examples ==
Examples of collective trademarks include:
* the &quot;CA&quot; device used by the Institute of Chartered Accountants;
* the mark &quot;CPA&quot;, used to indicate members of the Society of Certified Public Accountants; and,
* the marks of various confederated lobby groups.

==Related cases==
* The Parma Ham case [1991] RPC 251, in which the &quot; Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma&quot; sued for passing off their unregistered collective mark;
* &quot;Association of Certified Public Accountants v. Trade Secretary&quot; [1998] 1 WLR 164.

<text>Robert Blake Harper (1939 ‚Äì July 22, 2003) was a Canadian-born radio and video DJ.

== Radio ==
Harper debuted on the air in Shenandoah, Iowa, where he worked at a radio station to help to pay his college expenses. Much of his job involved playing recorded religious programs.

First making it big in Cincinnati, Ohio, at WSAI (AM) and in Kansas City, Missouri, at WDAF, Harper moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in the late 1960s and joined the staff of WQXI radio. &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; writer Bill Dial worked with Harper at WQXI and used him as the inspiration for the sitcom&#x27;s off-the-wall character Dr. Johnny Fever, played by Howard Hesseman.

In June 1965, Harper was fired from WSAI after he was involved in legal problems including three speeding convictions in 14 months and convictions for disorderly conduct. WSAI&#x27;s owners also fired the station&#x27;s general manager, who had allowed Harper to continue working up to that point.

While in Atlanta, Harper also worked for seven other radio stations, including WIIN, WPLO, WGST, WLTA, WKLS, WAKY and WSB. Born and raised in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, Harper was a die-hard hockey fan and served as a color commentator for Atlanta Flames radio and television broadcasts.

An article in &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; in 1975 described Harper as the &quot;one-time rascal of early morning repartee for WIIN radio&quot; and said that he was &quot;once known as The King of Bad Taste&quot;. In his early years on WIIN, Harper was known for editorializing as he ranted against the Vietnam War and President Richard Nixon. He also made unexpected telephone calls to the White House and J. Edgar Hoover, as well as others.

== Television ==
Harper left WAKY at the end of January 1970 to return to Atlanta ‚Äî to work in television, at WTCG, rather than in radio. An article in &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; reported that Harper &quot;told about a TV show, as yet unnamed, patterned after a Top 40 radio operation, designed to run twice a week.&quot; The program, &quot;Now Explosion&quot;, ran from noon each Saturday until 2 a.m. Sunday and from noon each Sunday until 3 a.m. Monday. Harper and Bob Todd were the hosts.

Later in 1970, a different version of the program, &quot;The Now Explosion!&quot; was broadcast on WPIX-TV in New York City. It premiered on June 20 with a 4:30-6 p.m. broadcast followed by a different episode that night from 11 o&#x27;clock to 2 a.m. Harper was described in an article in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; as &quot;the off-camera announcer&quot;. The programs were recorded in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

In 1971, Harper teamed with Freddie Miller on &quot;The Miller-Harper Sports Report&quot; on WTCG-TV in Atlanta.

== Other activities ==
After being released from WSB in 1991, Harper stayed in Atlanta but left radio, going to work in the corporate communications office of Delta Air Lines. He went on to work for MARTA and Underground Atlanta before retiring.
== Death ==
Harper died on July 22, 2003, in Atlanta from lung cancer.

<text>Ellen Naomi Cohen (September 19, 1941 ‚Äì July 29, 1974), known professionally as Cass Elliot, was an American singer. She was also known as &quot;Mama Cass&quot;, a name she reportedly disliked. Elliot was a member of the singing group the Mamas &amp; the Papas. After the group broke up, she released five solo albums. Elliot received the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary (R&amp;R) Performance for &quot;Monday, Monday&quot; (1967). In 1998, she was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for her work with the Mamas &amp; the Papas.

== Early life and education ==
Ellen Naomi Cohen was born on September 19, 1941 in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of Philip (died 1962) and Bess Cohen (n√©e Levine; 1915‚Äì1994). All four of her grandparents were Russian-Jewish immigrants. Her family was subject to significant financial stresses and uncertainties during her childhood years. Her father, involved in several business ventures, ultimately succeeded through the development of a lunch wagon in Baltimore that provided meals to construction workers. Her mother was a trained nurse. Elliot had a brother, Joseph, and a younger sister, Leah, who also became a singer and recording artist. Elliot&#x27;s early life was spent with her family in Alexandria, Virginia, and when she was 15, the family moved back to Baltimore, where they had briefly lived at the time of Elliot&#x27;s birth.

Elliot adopted the name &quot;Cass&quot; in high school. She assumed the surname &quot;Elliot&quot; some time later, in memory of a friend who had died. While in Alexandria, she attended George Washington High School. When Elliot&#x27;s family returned to Baltimore, she attended Forest Park High School in Dorchester. While attending Forest Park High School, Elliot became interested in acting. She won a small part in the play &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;, a summer stock production at the Hilltop Theatre in Owings Mills, Maryland in 1959 under the name Ellen Cohen. She left high school shortly before graduation and moved to New York City to further her acting career (as recounted in the lyrics to &quot;Creeque Alley&quot;).

== Career ==

=== 1962‚Äì1964: Early career ===
After leaving high school to pursue an entertainment career in New York, Elliot toured in the musical &quot;The Music Man&quot; in 1962 under the name Cass Elliot, but lost the part of Miss Marmelstein in &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot; to Barbra Streisand. Elliot sometimes sang while working as a cloakroom attendant at The Showplace in Greenwich Village, but she did not pursue a singing career until she moved to the Washington, DC, area to attend American University (not Swarthmore College as mentioned in the biographical song &quot;Creeque Alley&quot;).

America&#x27;s folk music scene was on the rise when Elliot met banjoist and singer Tim Rose and singer John Brown, and the three began performing as the Triumvirate. In 1963, James Hendricks replaced Brown, and the trio was renamed the Big 3. Elliot&#x27;s first recording with the Big 3 was &quot;Winken, Blinken, and Nod&quot;, released by FM Records in 1963. In 1964, the group appeared on an &quot;open mic&quot; night at The Bitter End in Greenwich Village, billed as Cass Elliot and the Big 3, followed onstage by folk singer Jim Fosso and bluegrass banjoist Eric Weissberg.

Tim Rose left the Big 3 in 1964, and Elliot and Hendricks teamed with Canadians Zal Yanovsky and Denny Doherty to form the Mugwumps. This group lasted eight months, after which Cass performed as a solo act for a while. In the meantime, Yanovsky and John Sebastian co-founded the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, while Doherty joined the New Journeymen, a group that also included John Phillips and his wife Michelle. In 1965, Doherty persuaded Phillips that Elliot should join the group, which she did while the group members and she were vacationing in the Virgin Islands.

A popular legend about Elliot is that her vocal range was improved by three notes after she was hit on the head by some copper tubing while walking through a construction site behind the bar where the New Journeymen were playing in the Virgin Islands. Elliot confirmed the story in a 1968 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, saying:

Friends later said that the pipe story was a less embarrassing explanation for why John Phillips had kept her out of the group for so long, because he considered her too fat.

=== 1965‚Äì1968: The Mamas &amp; the Papas ===
With two female members, the New Journeymen needed a new name and they agreed on the Mamas &amp; the Papas. The group lasted from 1965 to 1968. According to Doherty, as written in his website, Elliot had the inspiration for the band&#x27;s new name. Doherty also said that the occasion marked the beginning of his affair with fellow band member Michelle Phillips. Elliot was in love with Doherty and was displeased when he told her of the affair. Doherty has said that Elliot once proposed to him, but that he was so stoned at the time that he could not even respond.

Elliot was known for her sense of humor and optimism, and was considered by many to be the most charismatic member of the group. Her powerful, distinctive voice was a major factor in their string of hits, including &quot;California Dreamin&#x27;, &quot;Monday, Monday&quot;, and &quot;Words of Love&quot;. She also performed the solo &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; (credited on the label of the single as &#x27;Featuring Mama Cass with the Mamas and the Papas&#x27;), which the group recorded in 1968 after learning about the death of Fabian Andre, one of the men who co-wrote it, whom Michelle Phillips had met years earlier. Elliot&#x27;s version is noteworthy for its contemplative pace, whereas many earlier recordings of &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; (including one by Nat King Cole and another by Ozzie Nelson) had been up-tempo versions‚Äîthe song having been written in 1931 as a dance tune. The Mamas and the Papas continued to record to meet the terms of their record contract until 1971.

=== 1968‚Äì1973: Solo career===
After the breakup of the Mamas and the Papas, Elliot embarked on a solo singing career. Her most successful recording during this period was 1968&#x27;s &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; from her solo album of the same name, released by Dunhill Records, though it had originally been released earlier that year on the album &quot;The Papas &amp; The Mamas&quot;.

Las Vegas show
In October 1968, Elliot made her live solo debut headlining in Las Vegas at Caesars Palace, scheduled for a three-week engagement at $40,000 per week with two shows per night. According to Elliot, she went on a six-month crash diet before the show, losing 100 of her 300 pounds. However, she attributed a stomach ulcer and throat problems to her severe regimen, which she treated by drinking milk and cream‚Äîrapidly regaining 50 pounds in the process.

She was confined to her bed for three weeks before the first performance while the musical director, band, and production supervisor attempted to put together a show in her absence. She was scheduled to rehearse for a full three days before the show opened, but she managed to get through only part of one run-through with the band before saying that she was losing her voice. She skipped the remainder of rehearsals and drank tea and lemon, hoping to recover and pull herself together for opening night.

An audience of 950 people filled the Circus Maximus theater at Caesar&#x27;s Palace on the evening of Wednesday, October 16, including Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Jimi Hendrix, Joan Baez, Liza Minnelli, and Mia Farrow, who had sent flowers to Elliot&#x27;s dressing room, but backstage she had developed a raging fever. Friends urged her manager to cancel the show, but she felt that it was too important and insisted on performing. Sick and having barely rehearsed, she began to fall apart during the course of her first performance; her voice was weak and barely audible, and the large crowd was unsympathetic, despite the celebrity well-wishers. At the end of the show, Elliot returned to the stage to apologize to the audience; &quot;This is the first night, and it will get better&quot;, she said. She then sang &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; and left the stage as the audience applauded half-heartedly. She returned later that night to perform the second show, but her voice was worse, and many of the audience noisily walked out.

Reviews were harsh. &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine called the show &quot;Sink Along with Cass&quot; and &quot;a disaster&quot; that was &quot;heroic in proportion, epic in scope&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; called it &quot;an embarrassing drag&quot;, while &quot;Newsweek&quot; compared it to the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster: &quot;Like some great ocean liner embarking on an ill-fated maiden voyage, Mama Cass slid down the waves and sank to the bottom&quot;. The show closed after only one night, and Elliot flew back to Los Angeles for what was described as &quot;a tonsillectomy&quot;.

Within hours of the end of Elliot&#x27;s Las Vegas concert, rumors began to spread that she had been taking drugs during the weeks leading up to it. Eddi Fiegel wrote in the biography &quot;Dream a Little Dream of Me&quot; that Elliot later admitted to a boyfriend that she had injected heroin immediately before going on stage. Embarrassed by the debacle, Elliot plunged into a deep depression.

 Later work 

Elliot appeared in two television variety specials: &quot;The Mama Cass Television Program&quot; (ABC, 1969) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Mama Anymore&quot; (CBS, 1973). She was a regular guest on TV talk shows and variety shows in the early 1970s, including &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;, &quot;The Ray Stevens Show&quot;, &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, and was a guest panelist for a week on the game show &quot;Match Game &#x27;73&quot;. She guest-hosted for Johnny Carson on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and appeared as a guest on the show 13 other times. She also appeared on and co-hosted &quot;The Music Scene&quot; on ABC and was featured on the first &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; on NBC.

Elliot performed the title song &quot;The Good Times Are Comin during the opening sequence of the 1970 film &quot;Monte Walsh&quot;, starring Lee Marvin and Jack Palance. In 1970, Elliot was signed to RCA Records; her first album for RCA, &quot;Cass Elliot&quot;, was issued in January, 1972. Also in 1972, she made three appearances on the variety series &quot;The Julie Andrews Hour&quot;. Her final appearance on the show was the Christmas installment that aired on Wednesday, December 20, 1972. In December 1978, four years after Elliot&#x27;s death, the episode was rebroadcast on syndicated stations as a Christmas special titled &quot;Merry Christmas with Love, Julie&quot;. However, all of Elliot&#x27;s solos were deleted from the syndicated edit. In 2009, a complete videotape of &quot;The Julie Andrews Hour Christmas Show&quot; was donated to The Paley Center For Media in New York, with all of Elliot&#x27;s numbers intact.
In 1973, Elliot performed in &quot;Saga of Sonora&quot;, a TV music-comedy-Western special with Jill St. John, Vince Edwards, Zero Mostel, and Lesley Ann Warren. She also sang the jingle &quot;Hurry on down to Hardee&#x27;s, where the burgers are charco-broiled&quot; for Hardee&#x27;s advertisements. Throughout the early 1970s, Elliot continued her acting career, as well. She had a featured role in the movie &quot;Pufnstuf&quot; (1970) and made guest appearances on TV&#x27;s &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;; &quot;Young Dr. Kildare&quot;; &quot;Love, American Style&quot;; and &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;; among others.

In 1973, Elliot hired as her manager Allan Carr, who was also managing the careers of Tony Curtis, Ann-Margret, and Peter Sellers. Carr felt Elliot needed to leave pop and rock music and head into the cabaret circuit, so a show was put together comprising old standards along with a few new songs written for her by friends. The act included Elliot and two male singers who served as backup singers and sidekicks during the musical numbers. The title of the show was &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Mama Anymore&quot;, named after one of the songs written by Elliot&#x27;s friend Earle Brown. The song was born out of Elliot&#x27;s frustration with being identified as &quot;Mama Cass&quot;. The show debuted in Pittsburgh on February 9, 1973. Elliot felt ready to tackle Las Vegas once again and premiered at the Flamingo. This time, she received rave reviews. &quot;The Las Vegas Sun&quot; wrote, &quot;Cass Elliot, making a strong point that she is no longer Mama Cass, has a good act serving notice that she is here to stay. The audience was with her all the way¬†... no empty seats anywhere.&quot; She then took her act to higher-echelon casinos and swankier nightclubs in cities throughout the country.

Elliot provided the voice for her appearance on the 1973 episode of &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, &quot;The Haunted Candy Factory&quot;. She also appeared on &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot; in the episodes &quot;The Secret Serum&quot;, &quot;Pawn of Shadows&quot;, and &quot;Dance of the Undead&quot; as a Crystal Cove citizen.

The city of Baltimore dedicated August 15, 1973, as &quot;Cass Elliot Day&quot; in her honor for her homecoming.

==Final performances, death, and funeral ==

On April 22, 1974, Elliot collapsed in the California television studio of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; immediately before her scheduled appearance on the show. She was treated at a hospital and released, then dismissed the incident as simple exhaustion in interviews and in the conversation she had with Carson during her May 7 visit to his show‚Äôs studio where she made it through the telecast.

Soon after Elliot videotaped an appearance on the syndicated &quot;Mike Douglas Show&quot;, which originated from Philadelphia, she began two weeks of solo concerts at the London Palladium. She felt elated by the standing ovation she received on the last night of the engagement, which was Saturday night, July 27. She made an international phone call to Michelle Phillips, during which Elliot cried from happiness over her success at the Palladium, as Phillips has stated in numerous interviews. Elliot began a 24-hour celebration. She first attended the 31st birthday party of Mick Jagger at his home on Tite Street in Chelsea, London. After the party, Elliot went to a brunch in her honor presented by Georgia Brown. While there, according to biographer Eddi Fiegel, Elliot was blowing her nose frequently, coughing and having trouble breathing. Next she attended a cocktail party hosted by American entertainment journalist Jack Martin. She seemed in high spirits but also appeared physically exhausted and sick. Elliot left that party at 8:00¬†p.m. on Sunday, July 28, saying she was tired and needed to get some sleep.

Elliot retired to an apartment at Flat 12, 9 Curzon Place (later Curzon Square) in the Shepherd Market area of the Mayfair neighbourhood of Central London, owned by singer-songwriter Harry Nilsson who allowed her to stay there. Later that night, several hours after Elliot left Jack Martin&#x27;s cocktail party, she died in her sleep at age 32. Her body was discovered by a close friend of hers who went to check on her. According to Keith Simpson, who conducted her autopsy, she died of a heart attack, and there were no drugs in her system. Four years later, Keith Moon, drummer for The Who, died in the same bedroom, also aged 32 years.

Elliot did not die from choking on a ham sandwich, as has been alleged. According to Lindsay Zoladz in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2024, this &quot;cartoonish rumor‚Äîpropagated in endless pop culture references, from &quot;Austin Powers&quot; to &quot;Lost&quot;‚Äîcast a tawdry light over Elliot‚Äôs legacy and still threatens to overshadow her mighty, underappreciated talent.&quot; In 2020, a journalist and friend of Elliot&#x27;s, Sue Cameron, publicly admitted that she promulgated the false ham sandwich story by writing it into Elliot&#x27;s obituary for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. She claimed she was asked to print the lie by Elliot&#x27;s manager Allan Carr, who decided that the humiliating falsehood was preferable to any implication that Elliot&#x27;s death was associated with substance abuse. 

Elliot&#x27;s body was cremated at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. Her ashes were later buried in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and family ===

Elliot was married twice, the first time in 1963 to Jim Hendricks, her groupmate in the Big 3 and the Mugwumps. It was a marriage of convenience to assist him in avoiding being drafted during the Vietnam War; the marriage was never consummated and was annulled in 1968. In 1971, Elliot married journalist Donald von Wiedenman, heir to a Bavarian barony. Their marriage ended in divorce after a few months.

Elliot gave birth to a daughter, Owen Vanessa Elliot(-Kugell), on April 26, 1967. Elliot-Kugell also grew up to become a singer and toured with Beach Boys member Al Jardine. Cass Elliot never publicly identified the father, but many years later, Michelle Phillips helped Elliot-Kugell locate her biological father, Chuck Day. His paternity was not publicly revealed until his 2008 death. After Elliot&#x27;s death, her younger sister, Leah Kunkel (then married to Los Angeles‚Äìbased session drummer Russ Kunkel), gained custody of seven-year-old Owen and raised her along with her own son, Nathaniel.

=== Drug use ===
David Crosby published a memoir in 1988 saying he used opiates and cocaine with her, preferring heroin in London because of its availability there.

===1967 legal issue===
In 1967, while staying in London, Elliot was prosecuted for stealing bed linen from a hotel where she and her bandmates had stayed on an earlier visit. She denied responsibility, and the case was brought before the West London magistrates&#x27; court, where the charges against her were dismissed in the absence of any evidence. The Mamas &amp; the Papas were forced to cancel their upcoming British concerts as a result of the incident, and the band broke up the next year. On a return visit to London, Elliot admitted to the audience at the London Palladium that she had taken two sheets, saying &quot;I liked &#x27;em so I took &#x27;em&quot;. She said she had kept quiet because of the way she had been treated in police custody.

== Awards and nominations ==
==Commemoration==

Elliot received the 2,735th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 3, 2022.

The British play and film &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot; feature her recordings, and one character reflects on her memories of Elliot. Elliot was the subject of a 2004 stage production in Dublin, &quot;The Songs of Mama Cass&quot;, with Kristin Kapelli performing main vocals. Elliot was portrayed by Shannon Lee in the Bruce Lee Biopic &quot;&quot;. She was portrayed by Rachel Redleaf in the 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;.

The Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash &quot;Daylight Again&quot; video released in 1982 was dedicated to Cass Elliot as was the Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album released in 2005.

The song &quot;Mama, I Remember You Now&quot; by Swedish artist Marit Bergman is a tribute to Elliot.

Elliot&#x27;s recording of &quot;Make Your Own Kind of Music&quot; is featured prominently in several episodes of seasons two and three of &quot;Lost&quot; as well as season eight, episodes two and nine of &quot;Dexter&quot; (the later one also uses the title as the episode&#x27;s title). It was also featured in ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Middle&quot; when Sue Heck graduates from high school and in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Sex Education&quot; when Aimee smashes up an abandoned car. Her recording of &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Better&quot; is featured in a season-four episode of &quot;Lost&quot;.

<doc id="277525" wikidata="Q5304209" url="?curid=277525" title="Dr. Johnny Fever">
<text>Dr. Johnny Fever is a fictional character on the American television sitcom &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;. He was inspired by Skinny Bobby Harper, who previously had been a DJ in Atlanta and on Cincinnati&#x27;s Top 40 station WSAI. The character was portrayed by Howard Hesseman.

==Before and after the format change==
Johnny Fever, whose real name is John Caravella, grew up in a broken home. His relationship with his father was poor and his parents eventually separated when he was still young. While he was still a child, a tornado struck the mobile home community where he and his mother were living, leaving him with a near-pathological fear of windstorms. He was a hippie in the 1960s, 10 to 12 years before the show&#x27;s timeframe. Johnny began working his way up in the radio business and became a highly popular and successful DJ. At the height of his career, he was a star at a major station in Los Angeles, where he worked under the name &quot;Johnny Sunshine&quot; and did a popular show called &quot;Johnny Sunshine, Boss Jock&quot; (thus implying the station was &quot;Boss Radio&quot; originator KHJ). After he said the word &quot;booger&quot; on the air, he was fired with a year left on his contract. He sued the station for wrongful dismissal and received a large cash settlement after a few years. After being forced out of L.A. his career took a nosedive. For several years he led a nomadic existence, going from town to town taking a series of unsatisfying and low-paying jobs at low-rated stations including a job hosting a garden show in Amarillo. He has used many on-air names, including Johnny Duke, Johnny Style, Johnny Cool, Johnny Midnight, and even Heavy Early. (Most of these names appear on the side of Johnny&#x27;s coffee cup.) He finally hit &quot;rock bottom,&quot; in his own words, when he landed in Cincinnati at the worst radio station in town, WKRP, the only station that would hire him, by 1976. He found himself hosting a &quot;beautiful music&quot; show in the morning, so obviously bored with the music that he didn&#x27;t even bother to make up a new name or on-air persona.

When Andy Travis takes over as program director of WKRP and changes the format to rock n&#x27; roll, Johnny is initially doubtful that he can succeed as the morning man in the new format; conscious of his own age, Johnny advises Andy to find someone &quot;about fifteen years younger,&quot; but Andy insists that he can handle it‚Äî-and even gives him permission to say &quot;booger&quot; on the air. When he gets on the air the first time after the format change, Johnny comes alive, signaling the change with a loud drag on the playing record (a fictional black gospel cover of &quot;(You&#x27;re) Having My Baby&quot; by the Hallelujah Tabernacle Choir), after literally folding the record album on the other turntable in half. He immediately adopts the new, hyper-excited persona of &quot;Dr. Johnny Fever,&quot; by playing the first record (&quot;Queen of the Forest&quot; by Ted Nugent), and telling his listeners:

: All right, Cincinnati, it is time for this town to get down! You&#x27;ve got Johnny‚Äî&quot;Doctor&quot; Johnny Fever, and I am burnin&#x27; up in here! Whoa! Whoo! We all in critical condition, babies, but you can tell me where it hurts, because I got the healing prescription here from the big &#x27;KRP musical medicine cabinet. Now I am talking about your 50,000 watt intensive care unit, babies! So just sit right down, relax, open your ears real wide and say, &quot;Give it to me straight, Doctor. I can take it!&quot;

He then starts the station&#x27;s first rock record, before donning his sunglasses and then triumphantly saying, &quot;I almost forgot, fellow babies: BOOGER!&quot;

On the DVD audio commentary track for this episode, series creator Hugh Wilson credits Hesseman for largely improvising this entire speech.

==On-air style==
The &quot;Doctor&quot; is a great talker to his radio audience when he is in a confident mood. He can jive with the best DJs of his era. He once gives Bailey Quarters, nascent newswoman, this sage advice: &quot;Talk into the microphone as if you were talking to your best friend.&quot; Later, in that same episode (&quot;Mike Fright&quot;), he would have to gather the courage to take his own advice.

Never a fan of disco, the new music fad of the era, he is a lover of rock and roll, although he feels he is getting too old to be a DJ in the genre (aside from two episodes on which he adopts a disco persona for a high-paying television job‚Äîsee below). Tunes like &quot;Hey Jude&quot; are used for bathroom breaks or extended chats with friends.

Though the format of WKRP is Top 40, Johnny frequently refuses to play any songs off the station playlist, choosing instead to highlight album-oriented rock and old R&amp;B favorites on his own show. A consultant hired by Mrs. Carlson at one point describes Johnny as being &quot;stuck in 1962&quot;. Andy frequently pleads with Johnny to stick to the playlist, to play just one disco song, only to have Johnny threaten to &quot;throw himself in front of Donna Summer&#x27;s tour bus&quot;. Andy actually goes into a state of hysteria when he hears Johnny playing &quot;The Long Run&quot; by The Eagles: &quot;That&#x27;s a hit! He&#x27;s playing a hit!&quot;

Fever&#x27;s unorthodox choice of music pays off as the series goes on, and by the final episode he has become the number-one morning DJ in the city. Johnny&#x27;s views towards his music and his audience were perhaps best summed up when, picking a record, he exclaims &quot;Sacred music...B.B. King!&quot; Once, during a bomb threat, he remarked &quot;If I die, who will teach the children about Bo Diddley?&quot;

Herb Tarlek, the account executive, can never land the big accounts. As a result, Fever and the other DJs on WKRP have to do voiceovers (done live in that era) for spots for funeral homes and Red Wigglers, the &quot;Cadillac&quot; of worms (to which Fever adds the tag line &quot;available at finer worm stores everywhere!&quot;). However, Johnny has his scruples, as when he walks out of a recording session for sports aids when he realized his dialogue is laced with euphemisms for dangerous drug effects. While it is strongly implied that Johnny is a frequent user of marijuana, he doesn&#x27;t go in for harder drugs, and leads a campaign to shut down a businessman who is trying to sell speed to teenagers. He also discovers his brief successor, Doug Winner (Philip Charles MacKenzie) has been accepting cocaine for airplay under a payola scheme with a sleazy record promoter. Johnny doesn&#x27;t rat Doug out (instead he tells Mr. Carlson that it&#x27;s &quot;foot powder&quot;), but cautions him about the dangers of cocaine abuse, knowing he&#x27;ll eventually hang himself with his own noose, which subsequently happens and Johnny gets his old job back.

==Personal life==
Johnny&#x27;s early life is not explored in the original show. However, in the sequel series &quot;The New WKRP In Cincinnati&quot;, it is established that Johnny never knew his father (which clashes slightly with the continuity from the original series, where he had a poor relationship with his father, but did at least know him); his mother, Carrie, was a singer who recorded with Buddy Rich. He was left in the care of his straightlaced Uncle George (a minister) and Aunt Phoebe in Indiana, and chafed at their restrictive rules, although he knew his uncle and aunt loved him. He eventually left home at 17.

Johnny&#x27;s persona is generally one of an aging burnt out ex-hippie. After spending most of his life in a nomadic existence &quot;up and down the dial&quot;, WKRP settles Johnny down and establishes a relatively stable ensemble of friends and associates for him. Although the tradeoff is a cramped apartment and low pay, this arrangement doesn&#x27;t seem to overly concern him much (at one point he describes himself as &quot;a 40-year-old man who lives like a college student&quot;). He is also believed to have been incarcerated at least twice; once in Mexico, where he says he was involved in a &quot;minor misunderstanding with 145 Mexican cops,&quot; and another time in New Jersey when he indicated that he, &quot;Went through Princeton...It was in a car...A police car actually! Very, very educational.&quot; He was a hippie in the 1960s, 10‚Äì12 years before the show&#x27;s time frame. It is implied that he smokes marijuana by his overall character, and occasional references to drug culture (e.g. Mr. Carlson once dismissed a business as a front for selling drug paraphernalia, and Johnny immediately asked where it was). In the first-season episode, &quot;Fish Story&quot;, he shows a near superhuman resistance to the effects of alcohol, apparently building up a high tolerance after years of heavy drinking. He is often seen wearing a &quot;Black Death Malt Liquor&quot; T-shirt, designed by Rip Off Press underground comic artist Dave Sheridan.

He has been married twice, with both of his ex-wives collecting alimony. This places Johnny in a constant state of poverty, despite his $17,500 annual salary ($ today) at WKRP (season 1 &quot;Goodbye, Johnny&quot;), albeit placing him well behind the $24,000 salary ($ today) of receptionist Jennifer Marlowe (season 1 &quot;Mama&#x27;s Review&quot;). After his first divorce, he lived for two years with a woman named Buffy (Julie Payne); Buffy later tracked him down in Cincinnati, and threatened to sue him for a portion of his income.

Johnny also has a college-age daughter, Laurie (Patrie Allen), who visits him in season two&#x27;s &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and briefly moves in with him. He later (season three&#x27;s &quot;Three Days of the Condo&quot;) gives his daughter the majority of his legal settlement ‚Äì roughly one year&#x27;s salary ‚Äì from the Los Angeles station that fired him for saying &quot;booger&quot;. There is some suggestion in one episode that he might still be in love with Laurie&#x27;s mother, his first wife, Paula (Ruth Silveira), though they agree that their relationship is over, and Paula marries another man (Hamilton Camp) (season three&#x27;s &quot;Till Debt Do Us Part&quot;). Johnny&#x27;s second wife never makes an appearance. Their parting was not as amicable: she tried to kill Johnny with a Ronco Veg-O-Matic. At the end of an episode of &quot;The New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot;, Johnny implies to WKRP&#x27;s new morning host Razor D (French Stewart) that he may be his illegitimate father, having met his mother at a Grateful Dead concert near the speakers.

Beginning in the second season, he becomes on and off romantically involved with fellow employee, Bailey Quarters. Though the staff is usually indifferent, the rumor mills begin humming when Bailey invites Johnny to stay at her apartment while his apartment is being fumigated (he claims it&#x27;s for lizards). Though Johnny is flattered by the attention at first, he quickly tires of the leering gestures from some of the male staffers and tells Andy that the rumors of him and Bailey shacking up aren&#x27;t true, and expresses his dissatisfaction of the treatment Bailey has been getting. At another point later in the series, Bailey and Johnny are again implied to be, if not an item, at least very close when Bailey asks Johnny &quot;if I get some cutoffs, want to go with me?&quot;, and Johnny&#x27;s non-verbal reaction clearly indicates they have an intense attraction to each other. In the season three episode &quot;Till Debt Do Us Part&quot;, Bailey accepts Johnny&#x27;s offer to join him on a Caribbean vacation (later cancelled by Herb&#x27;s actions), though she does say she expects separate rooms. The series left their relationship implied but ambiguous.

Out of all the staff, Johnny appears to be the closest to fellow DJ Venus Flytrap, to the point where Venus gives him financial advice, bets on horses and football games with him, and even knows which seedy bars Johnny spends time at (for his part, Venus once claimed that he came to WKRP specifically &quot;to work with the Doctor&quot;).

In the second season episode, &quot;God Talks to Johnny&quot;, after hearing a voice he believes to be God Himself, Johnny (and almost everyone else) is convinced he&#x27;s going crazy; Johnny mentions that the voice said, &quot;I love you, I want you to seek knowledge, and (though he&#x27;s not certain) I want you to be a golf pro!&quot; When Johnny admits himself into a hospital late at night, he is met by Mr. Carlson, a devoted Christian, who tells Johnny that there is nothing wrong with hearing God&#x27;s voice, but doubted it was God, saying, &quot;If God had something He wanted to say, you&#x27;d &quot;hear&quot; it.&quot;

Johnny has also proven to be a shrewd judge of character. Case in point, in the series finale, &quot;Up And Down The Dial&quot;, the latest ratings book lists Johnny as the #1 morning DJ in the Cincinnati market with the station itself now at #6 overall. But Mrs. Carlson suddenly decides to change the station&#x27;s format from Top 40 to an all-news format. Slightly inebriated from the office party, Johnny confronts Mrs. Carlson at her home, at which point she admits to Johnny that WKRP was meant to be a liability to her business empire for tax write-off purposes; the surprise format change was meant to undo the station&#x27;s unexpected affluence. Incredulous at her hypocrisy and callous manipulation (&quot;You are telling your own son that you want him to be the general manager of the number one station in the market, and you&#x27;d be happier if it was sixteenth! How do you think he‚Äôd feel if he knew?‚Äù), Johnny threatens blackmail by telling Mr. Carlson her true intentions behind the format change, but Mrs. Carlson undercuts Johnny and instead tells Arthur that WKRP can keep the rock format.

==Other jobs==
In an early episode, Johnny&#x27;s new persona and his immediate popularity earn him a job offer from another station in Los Angeles with the biggest competitor of the station that fired him. His co-workers at WKRP throw him a party where they try to convince him not to leave; he admits how much he loves and cares about the people he works with. But in a reversal of sitcom conventionality, Johnny actually takes the L.A. job, but in &quot;Johnny Returns&quot;, he is almost instantly fired for saying &quot;jive-ass&quot; on the air.

Later in his WKRP career, Johnny Fever is approached by a female television producer (Mary Frann) to be a TV DJ for her disco program &quot;Gotta Dance&quot;. &quot;Rip Tide,&quot; Johnny&#x27;s TV persona, is money-hungry, disco-loving, chummy with Herb Tarlek, and has a very different voice and personality. In the two-part episode &quot;Dr. Fever and Mr. Tide,&quot; Johnny loses control of his personality when his alter-ego takes over while on the radio. He seems to be totally taken over by the Rip Tide persona until Andy Travis decides he would rather have Rip Tide as his morning DJ (causing Johnny to have an existential crisis) and Jennifer Marlowe disowns the sleazy Rip persona. Facing his demons, Johnny, as Rip, goes on TV and defames the industry with accusations of payola and using casting couches, then flips the music to Little Richard, killing off Rip Tide for good.

Dr. Johnny Fever never leaves the WKRP &quot;family&quot; of employees for the duration of the original series, but in &quot;the New WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; he has moved on to at least two more stations. He admits that the Cincinnati job is a good situation for him, but does occasionally wonder about what he is missing elsewhere by staying. He does return to WKRP for two two-part episodes in Season 1; then, late in the second season, he steps in as temporary overnight DJ when the station&#x27;s longstanding and never-seen jock, Moss Steiger, dies. Johnny gets a full send-off near the end of the new series when he decides to return to Los Angeles.

==Casting==
The role of Dr. Johnny Fever was originally intended for Richard Libertini, but he became unavailable. Howard Hesseman was known to &quot;WKRP&quot;&#x27;s production company, MTM Enterprises, from his recurring guest role as Mr. Plager on MTM&#x27;s &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. He was originally considered for the role of Herb Tarlek, but when he read the pilot script, he decided that Johnny was the part he really wanted. He was particularly suited for the part because he had actually been a disc jockey at one time, and he brought some of his experience to the character of Johnny -- including picking most of the songs that Johnny played on the show. Also, Hesseman had played wacky hippies before in &quot;Dragnet&quot; and in the film &quot;Billy Jack&quot;. Hesseman was also cast as a DJ in the second season, first episode of the 1975 TV show &quot;Switch&quot; titled &quot;Pirates of Tin Pan Alley&quot;.

<text>The Ruins of Saint Paul&#x27;s (; ) are the remnants of a 17th-century Catholic religious complex in Santo Ant√≥nio, Macau. They include what was originally St. Paul&#x27;s College and the Church of St. Paul (&quot;Igreja de S√£o Paulo&quot;), also known as &quot;Mater Dei&quot;, a 17th-century Portuguese church dedicated to Saint Paul the Apostle. Today, the ruins are one of Macau&#x27;s best-known landmarks and one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World. In 2005, they were officially listed as part of the Historic Centre of Macau, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== History ==

Built from 1602 to 1640 by the Jesuits, during the time in which Portugal and Spain were under the same crown, the church was one of the largest Catholic churches in Asia at the time. It was destroyed by a fire during a typhoon on 26January 1835. The Fortaleza do Monte overlooks the ruin.
The ruins now consist of the stone frontispiece. The fa√ßade sits on a small hill, with 68 stone steps leading up to it. 

The fa√ßade is shaped like a retable and themed around the Assumption of Mary. Likely influenced by Japanese Christian craftsmen who worked on it, the ruins of St. Paul&#x27;s include carvings with heterodox images that draw from Asian traditions, including Mary stepping on a seven-headed hydra, described in accompanying Chinese characters as &quot;Holy Mother tramples the heads of the dragon&quot;. The base of the structure has six Chinese guardian lions carved from stone.

The Japanese Christian craftsmen who worked on St. Paul&#x27;s were converted by Jesuits and expelled from Japan in 1587 when Toyotomi Hideyoshi banned Christianity.

The remains of around 250 Korean and Japanese slaves from the Portuguese slave trade are buried near the church.

==Conservation==
Resisting calls for the dangerously leaning structure to be demolished, from 1990 to 1995, the ruins were excavated under the auspices of the Instituto Cultural de Macau to study its historic past. The crypt and the foundations were uncovered, revealing the architectural plan of the building. Numerous religious artifacts were also found together with the relics of the Chinese Christian martyrs and the monastic clergy, including the founder of the Jesuit college in Macau, Father Alessandro Valignano.

The ruins were restored by the Macanese government into a museum, and the fa√ßade is now buttressed with concrete and steel in a way which preserves the aesthetic integrity of the fa√ßade. There was once a steel stairway that allowed tourists to climb up to the top of the fa√ßade from the rear, but due to concerns for the preservation of the church, tourists are no longer allowed to climb up.

<text>Lothar Fischer (November 8, 1933 ‚Äì June 15, 2004) was a German sculptor.

He was born in Germersheim, Palatinate. Between 1952 and 1958 he studied under Professor Heinrich Kirchner at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste, Munich. In 1958, he received a three-month scholarship to the Villa Massimo in Rome from the Arnold‚Äôsche Stiftung (Arnold‚Äôsche Foundation).
After this he joined the painters Heimrad Prem, Helmut Sturm and Hans-Peter Zimmer in founding the group SPUR, which in 1959 entered the Situationist International. That year he participated in the &quot;Junge Kunst&quot; (Young Art) exhibition in Ulm.

By 1962 the SPUR group had been expelled from the Situationist International. He participated in their exhibition at the Galerie van de Loo. The next year he was involved in &quot;Visione e Colore&quot; (Visions and Colours) in the Palazzo Grassi, Venice before joining other SPUR colleagues in the &quot;Nouveaux Espaces&quot; exhibition in Paris. He then had a single exhibition at the Gallery van de Loo.

He was a member of the German Artists federation from 1963 to 1994. During the rest of the 1960s he continued to exhibit his work in Kassel, Amsterdam, Duisburg, Darmstadt and Wiesbaden. In 1971 he produced a sculpture for the city of Munich and another in 1972 for Darmstadt. Then in 1973 he had a solo exhibition in the Gallerie d&#x27;Arte del Naviglio, Milan.

From 1975 to 1997 Fischer was professor at the University of the Arts, Berlin. He continued to exhibit mainly in Germany and Switzerland with one exhibition in New York in 1988 at the Stephen Haller Gallery. He lived and worked in Berlin and in Baierbrunn near Munich until the time of his death. Fischer was awarded the Kunstpreis Rheinland-Pfalz in 1990.

<doc id="277532" wikidata="Q853915" url="?curid=277532" title="Economic geology">
<text>Economic geology is concerned with earth materials that can be used for economic and industrial purposes. These materials include precious and base metals, nonmetallic minerals and construction-grade stone. Economic geology is a subdiscipline of the geosciences; according to Lindgren (1933) it is ‚Äúthe application of geology‚Äù. It may be called the scientific study of the Earth&#x27;s sources of mineral raw materials and the practical application of the acquired knowledge.

The study is primarily focused on metallic mineral deposits and mineral resources. The techniques employed by other Earth science disciplines (such as geochemistry, mineralogy, geophysics, petrology, paleontology and structural geology) might all be used to understand, describe and exploit an ore deposit.

Economic geology is studied and practiced by geologists. Economic geology may be of interest to other professions such as engineers, environmental scientists and conservationists because of the far-reaching impact that extractive industries have on society, the economy and the environment.

== Purpose of study ==
The purpose of the study of economic geology is to gain understanding of the genesis and localization of ore deposits plus the minerals associated with ore deposits. Though metals, minerals and other geologic commodities are non-renewable in human time frames, the impression of a fixed or limited stock paradigm of scarcity has always led to human innovation resulting in a replacement commodity substituted for those commodities which become too expensive. Additionally the fixed stock of most mineral commodities is huge (e.g., copper within the Earth&#x27;s crust given current rates of consumption would last for more than 100 million years.) Nonetheless, economic geologists continue to successfully expand and define known mineral resources.

== Mineral resources ==

Mineral resources are concentrations of minerals significant for current and future societal needs. Ore is classified as mineralization economically and technically feasible for extraction. Not all mineralization meets these criteria for various reasons. The specific categories of mineralization in an economic sense are:

* &quot;Mineral occurrences&quot; or prospects of geological interest but not necessarily economic interest
* &quot;Mineral resources&quot; include those potentially economically and technically feasible and those that are not
* &quot;Ore reserves&quot;, which must be economically and technically feasible to extract

== Ore ==

Geologists are involved in the study of ore deposits, which includes the study of ore genesis and the processes within the Earth&#x27;s crust that form and concentrate ore minerals into economically viable quantities.

Study of metallic ore deposits involves the use of structural geology, geochemistry, the study of metamorphism and its processes, as well as understanding metasomatism and other processes related to ore genesis.

Ore deposits are delineated by mineral exploration, which uses geochemical prospecting, drilling and resource estimation via geostatistics to quantify economic ore bodies. The ultimate aim of this process is mining.

== Coal and petroleum ==

:&quot;See main articles Coal and Petroleum geology
The study of sedimentology is of prime importance to the delineation of economic reserves of petroleum and coal energy resources.

<text>Hans-Peter Zimmer (23 October 1936 - 5 September 1992) was a German painter and sculptor. He was born in Berlin and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich.

He formed Gruppe SPUR in 1957 with the painters Heimrad Prem, Helmut Sturm and the sculptor Lothar Fischer. After a joint exhibition at the Pavillon im Alten Botanischen Garten in Munich, they met the Danish artist and philosopher Asger Jorn, who linked them up with the Galerie Van de Loo which exhibited them.

In 1959 the group joined the Situationist International. In 1961 they were banned from the Haus der Kunst (House of Art) by the Bavarian Minister of Culture. In 1962 they were indicted for pornography and blasphemy. They were expelled from the Situationist International that year.

The group SPUR broke up in 1966. In the same year, Zimmer and Helmut Sturm founded Gruppe Geflecht, but Zimmer lost interest in the group activities soon and started a solo career. He completed studies in Hamburg and M√ºnchen. In 1982, he began work as a professor for painting at the HBK Braunschweig. He died in Soltau.

<doc id="277539" wikidata="Q708625" url="?curid=277539" title="Bob Tisdall">
<text>Robert Morton Newburgh Tisdall (16 May 1907 in Nuwara Eliya, Ceylon ‚Äì 27 July 2004 in Nambour, Queensland, Australia) was an Irish athlete who won a gold medal in the 400-metre hurdles at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Tisdall was raised in Nenagh, County Tipperary. He had run only six 400 m hurdles when he won the gold medal at the 1932 Olympic Games in a world record time of 51.7 seconds, which was not recognised under the rules of the time because he had hit a hurdle. Later, because of the notoriety of this incident, the rules were changed and the President of the IOC, Juan Antonio Samaranch, presented Tisdall with a Waterford crystal rose bowl with the image of him knocking over the last hurdle etched into the glass. Though the IAAF did not recognise the record at the time, they now recognise the mark, giving Tisdall credit for setting the milestone of being the first man under 52 seconds.

== Early career==

Born in Sri Lanka to a family of Irish landed gentry, he lived on his father&#x27;s plantation until the age of 5, when he returned to his family&#x27;s home in Ireland. Following prep school at Mourne Grange, Tisdall went on to Shrewsbury School, where he won the Public Schools , and at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he won a record four events ‚Äì and hurdles, long jump and shot put ‚Äì in the annual match against Oxford. This record was only equalled nearly 60 years later. Tisdall had a chance to compete in five events, but selected Ted Cawston to run for him in the low hurdles so that Cawston could receive his &quot;blue&quot;. Cawston justified his selection by winning the event that Tisdall had won the previous two years.

Tisdall set South African and Canadian records in the low hurdles in 1929, a year later setting Greek records in the same event. While at Cambridge in March 1932, he decided to try for a place in the Irish Olympic squad and after he ran 54.2 seconds (a record) for the Irish Championship hurdles in June that year, the authorities agreed to let him run in his new event at the Los Angeles Olympics, where he also came eighth in the decathlon.

== Olympics ==

In 1928, Ireland, as an independent nation, had won its first Olympic gold medal at Amsterdam with Dr Pat O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s unexpected victory in the hammer event. At the time he was barely out of the novice class and he had been included in the Irish Team mainly to gain experience of top-class competition. Over the years, he was to develop into one of the world&#x27;s greatest hammer-throwers and he demonstrated this by winning his second Olympic gold medal at Los Angeles in 1932.

This in fact brought a very special moment in Olympic history for Ireland. Within the short space of an hour Ireland won two Olympic gold medals on Monday, 1 August 1932. The first was won by Tisdall.

His father won the All-Irish Sprint Championship; his mother played hockey for Ireland and was a formidable golfer. His Olympic victory had the &quot;element of a fairy tale about it&quot;, as one commentator put it.

Tisdall had, in the midst of The Depression, what he describes as &quot;the best job in the world&quot;, as an aide to a young Indian Maharaja, escorting him around Europe, showing him the cultural and natural sights. To pursue his Olympic dream, Tisdall had to leave this job and live in a disused railway carriage in an orchard, where he trained by running around the rows of trees.
Early in 1932, he wrote to General Eoin O&#x27;Duffy, then the President of the Olympic Council of Ireland, and asked to be considered for the Irish Olympic Team in the 400 metres hurdles and he also confessed that he had not previously run in the event.

O&#x27;Duffy was convinced that Tisdall could achieve a good time and later invited Tisdall to compete in a special Olympic trial at Croke Park in Dublin. Tisdall failed to make the qualifying time, but O&#x27;Duffy gave him another chance and Tisdall qualified for the Irish Team by winning the National hurdles title at the Irish Championships, also at Croke Park. At the team training camp, Tisdall discovered that there were no hurdles, so he collected driftwood from the beach and set up some crude hurdles on the greyhound racing track. This took him much of the morning, but just when he was ready to hurdle, someone activated the mechanical rabbit, which sped around the track rail, promptly knocking all the makeshift hurdles over. Finding out that there were hurdles available at a local girls&#x27; school, Tisdall cycled there and back each day, to use the hurdles, as the students were on vacation.

After winning his preliminary Olympic heat in Los Angeles, Tisdall equaled the Olympic record of 52.8 seconds in the semi-finals. It was only the fifth time he competed at this event.

Then in the final, despite stumbling at the final hurdle, he won the Olympic gold medal in 51.7 seconds which would have been a world record but for the fact that he had knocked over the last hurdle, and under the laws prevailing at the time, this ruled out recognition of a world record. It is worth noting that four Olympic hurdles champions appeared in that one race.

&quot;At that moment I experienced a strange feeling of loneliness‚Äîeverything was strangely quiet‚ÄîI began to wonder if the rest of the field had fallen over&quot; ‚Äì Bob Tisdall, approaching the final hurdle of the 1932 Olympic Games 400 m hurdles final, five meters ahead of the field.

Because of the wide reporting of Tisdall&#x27;s failure to clear the hurdle causing him to lose the record, people are still confused about the current state of the rules of hurdling, even though the rule was changed shortly thereafter.

In 2002, three statues honouring Olympic champions with links to Nenagh, Matt McGrath, Johnny Hayes and Bob Tisdall, were unveiled in front of the Nenagh Courthouse.

== Later life ==

Later in life, Tisdall lived in South Africa, where he ran a gymnasium during the day, which he converted to a night club after dark. He grew coffee in Tanzania, but moved to Nambour in 1969 with his wife Peggy, where he farmed fruit crops and cattle. He admitted to running his last race at the age of 80, though he ran in the Sydney Olympic torch relay at age 93. At that point he was the oldest living recipient of an individual track and field Olympic medal.

At the age of 96 he fell down a steep set of rock stairs and broke his shoulder, ribs and ruptured his spleen. He never completely recovered and died on 27 July 2004, aged 97.

<doc id="277541" wikidata="Q1142935" url="?curid=277541" title="Cup of Solid Gold">
<text>Cup of Solid Gold was the first official national anthem of China, adopted by the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1912) on 4 October 1911. Its title references the &quot;golden cup&quot;, a ritual instrument that symbolized the empire. Six days after the anthem&#x27;s adoption, the Wuchang Uprising broke out, which quickly led to the fall of the Qing dynasty.

== Background ==

Dynasties in Chinese history used music for various ceremonies, but never had official anthems representing the country. By the end of the nineteenth century, however, Qing China was constantly in contact with foreign countries and started to require a national anthem &quot;for diplomatic convenience&quot;.

Qing diplomats were one of the first to suggest adopting an official anthem. Zeng Jize (1839‚Äì1890) ‚Äì eldest son of statesman Zeng Guofan ‚Äì was the Qing envoy to France, Britain, and Russia for several years starting in 1878. Around 1880, he composed a song called &quot;Pu Tian Yue&quot; to be played as China&#x27;s anthem in various state ceremonies and suggested the Qing adopt it as its official anthem, but the court did not approve. That song&#x27;s lyrics and melody have both been lost for a very long time. However, an instrumental version of the anthem has been found and a part of what is seemingly the lyrics.

When Li Hongzhang (1823‚Äì1901) visited Western Europe and Russia in 1896 as a special envoy charged with learning about foreign institutions after the disastrous end of the Sino‚ÄìJapanese War in 1895, he was again asked to provide China&#x27;s national anthem for performance at state receptions. He hastily adapted some court music to a slightly modified &quot;jueju&quot; poem by Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) poet Wang Jian and presented that song as the Qing anthem. That song later became known as the &quot;Tune of Li Zhongtang&quot;, but was never officially recognized as a national anthem.

Another unofficial anthem was written for the new Qing ground forces that were established in 1906. Entitled &quot;Praise the Dragon Flag&quot;, it was played on ceremonial occasions, but like the songs promoted by Zeng Jize and Li Hongzhang, was never officially adopted as the Qing national anthem.

A Chinese version of the Japanese national anthem &quot;Kimigayo&quot; (adopted by the Meiji regime in 1888) was played in the new-style schools that taught modern topics like science and engineering. The Chinese lyrics ‚Äì &quot;To unify old territories, our ancient Asian country of four thousand years sighs in sorrow for the Jews, India, and Poland. Reading the history of those who have lost their countries, we shiver in our hearts!&quot; ‚Äì emphasized the Social Darwinist themes of ethnic crisis and loss of national territory, but many considered these too far from the usual themes of ceremonial music to be acceptable.

== The &quot;Cup of Solid Gold&quot; ==
On 25 January 1911, an official from the Ministry of Rites called Cao Guangquan (ÊõπÂª£Ê¨äÔºèÊõπÂπøÊùÉ) petitioned the Qing court to adopt a stately &quot;national music&quot; (&quot;guoyue&quot; ÂúãÊ®ÇÔºèÂõΩ‰πê) that could be performed at court ceremonies. He proposed that officials collect both ancient music and examples of state music from abroad and, on that basis, design an anthem for the Qing. The Ceremonial Council (Dianliyuan ÂÖ∏Á¶ÆÈô¢ÔºèÂÖ∏Á§ºÈô¢), which had just replaced the Ministry of Rites, responded on 15 July of that year. It put Putong () (1877‚Äì1950) ‚Äî a Manchu noble and direct descendant of the Daoguang Emperor who served in the Imperial Guard ‚Äî in charge of writing the melody, whereas Yan Fu (1854‚Äì1921), a translator of European scientific and philosophical treatises and an advisor to the Qing Navy, was charged with writing the lyrics. Guo Cengxin (), who had worked for the Ministry of Rites, made some minor modifications at the end.

The Qing government adopted &quot;Gong Jin&#x27;ou&quot; as its national anthem on 4 October 1911. The edict announcing the new anthem, and sometimes even the anthem&#x27;s music and lyrics, were published in newspapers, and the court instructed the Navy and Army to practice the song, which was also transmitted to China&#x27;s ambassadors throughout the world. However, the Wuchang Uprising took place on October 10 (six days after the anthem was promulgated) and quickly led to the fall of the dynasty. The foundation of the Republic of China was announced for 1 January 1912, and the last Qing emperor officially abdicated a little more than a month later. &quot;Gong Jin&#x27;ou&quot; was never performed publicly.

=== Title ===

&quot;Ou&quot; (Áîå) was a kind of wine vessel. &quot;Jin&#x27;ou&quot; (ÈáëÁîåÔºèÈáëÁìØ), or golden wine vessel, symbolized an &quot;indestructible country&quot;. The Qing emperor used such a vessel for ritual purposes. Inlaid with pearls and gems, it was known as the &quot;Cup of Eternal Solid Gold&quot; (&quot;Jin&#x27;ou Yonggu Bei&quot; ÈáëÁîåÊ∞∏Âõ∫ÊùØ). Because &quot;gong&quot; Èûè means &quot;to consolidate&quot; or &quot;to strengthen,&quot; the entire title may be translated as &quot;strengthening our hold on the golden cup.&quot;

Yan Fu, who wrote the lyrics, glossed the title and first line of the anthem as &quot;Firm and stable be the &#x27;golden cup&#x27; (which means the empire).&quot;

=== Music ===
The person who was nominally put in charge of the anthem&#x27;s music was Putong, an imperial relative. Aided by assistants in the Imperial Guard, he composed the music based on the models found in the &quot;Complement to the Treatise on Pitch Pipes&quot; (&quot;L√ºl√º Zhengyi Houbian&quot; ÂæãÂëÇÊ≠£Áæ©ÂæåÁ∑®ÔºèÂæãÂêïÊ≠£‰πâÂêéÁºñ; 1746), an imperial compilation that complemented a much shorter 1724 work on ceremonial music commissioned by the Kangxi Emperor.

=== Lyrics ===

The lyrics, composed by Yan Fu, are in Classical Chinese.
In the second line, &quot;tian chou&quot; Â§©Âπ¨ÔºèÂ§©Â∏± (literally, the &quot;canopy of Heaven&quot;) referred to the Mandate of Heaven, which a legitimate dynasty was supposed to represent. &quot;Tongpao&quot; ÂêåË¢ç (lit., &quot;sharing the same robes&quot;), an allusion to a verse in the &quot;Book of Poetry&quot;, meant &quot;sharing the same goals and loyalties&quot; or being part of the same army. In modern transcriptions of the lyrics, that phrase is often miswritten as &quot;tongbao&quot; ÂêåËÉû (&quot;compatriot&quot;), a term with racial connotations that the Manchu nobles who ruled Qing China purposely wanted to avoid.

Answering a request transmitted by George Ernest Morrison, on 16 March 1912 Yan Fu wrote to British Foreign Secretary Edward Grey to explain the Qing anthem, and ended his letter with a rough translation of the lyrics:
Firm and Stable be the &quot;golden cup&quot; (which means the empire) domed by the Celestial concave. In it, men and things happily prosper.
Glad are we who live in the time of Purity. May Heaven protect and secure us from enemies and help us to reach the truly golden age! Oh! The Blue firmament is infinitely high and the seas flow everlastingly.

The character &quot;qƒ´ng&quot; Ê∏Ö that Yan rendered as &quot;Purity&quot; was also the name of the Qing dynasty.

<text>The National University of Ireland (NUI) () is a federal university system of &quot;constituent universities&quot; (previously called &quot;constituent colleges&quot;) and &quot;recognised colleges&quot; set up under the Irish Universities Act 1908, and significantly amended by the Universities Act, 1997.

The constituent universities are for all essential purposes independent universities, except that the degrees and diplomas are those of the National University of Ireland with its seat in Dublin.

In post-nominals, the abbreviation &quot;NUI&quot; is used for degrees from all the constituent universities of the National University of Ireland.

==History==

Queen&#x27;s Colleges at Belfast, Cork, and Galway were established in 1845. In 1849 teaching commenced and a year later they were united under the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland. The Catholic University of Ireland was created as an independent university on 3 November 1854 for the education of Catholics; that university was not a recognised university and did not offer recognised degrees. In 1880 the Royal University of Ireland took over the degree awarding functions of the two former universities and offered recognised degrees to the graduates of the new University College Dublin and St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth, previously awarded under the Catholic University. The Catholic University became University College Dublin in 1882 under the direction of the Jesuits. In the 1890s its students achieved more distinctions than their counterparts in Belfast, Cork, and Galway, which had been originally established as secular institutions.

The 1908 reforms created the National University of Ireland and a separate Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast. The Royal University was dissolved in 1909, and in 1910 Maynooth became a recognised college of the NUI. Initially the National University, unlike the Royal University, did not award degrees for part-time or external students. Similarly to the Royal University, however, the National University was still banned from awarding degrees in Theology.

In 1975 the teacher training colleges of Carysfort College, Blackrock, St Patrick&#x27;s College, Drumcondra and Mary Immaculate College, Limerick became recognised colleges of the NUI. During 1976 and 1977 Thomond College of Education, Limerick was also a recognised college of the NUI. In 1978 St. Angela&#x27;s College, Sligo became affiliated to the NUI.

In 1996 the National College of Art and Design became a recognised college of the NUI. The 1997 reforms restructured the National University of Ireland, and an additional university at Maynooth was created from certain faculties of the previous recognised college, St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth. These reforms also removed the prohibition on theology that had been imposed on the National University and its predecessors.

===Legislative constituency===

Since 1918 the university&#x27;s graduates have formed a constituency in parliamentary elections. In 1918 it was formed as a constituency for the UK House of Commons. After the first election Eoin MacNeill abstained from Westminster and sat in the first D√°il. The NUI graduates elected four TDs to D√°il √âireann from 1921 until 1937 when the university constituencies were abolished by Fianna F√°il.

Under the Constitution of Ireland, adopted in 1937, the graduates of the university elect three members of Seanad √âireann (the senate). All graduates who are Irish citizens (regardless of living in the state or not) are entitled to vote if on the university&#x27;s register of electors. An honorary degree does not give the entitlement to vote. The election is conducted by postal vote.

At the 2020 Seanad election, for the 26th Seanad, the constituency returned three independents: Alice-Mary Higgins, Michael McDowell and R√≥n√°n Mullen.

==Governance==
The governing body of the NUI is styled the Senate under its 1908 charter. Members are called &quot;Members of the Senate&quot; rather than Senators; &quot;NUI Senator&quot; refers to the members of Seanad √âireann elected by NUI graduates. The NUI Senate meets in the Phelan Room, called after Edward J. Phelan, who funded its refurbishment. The Universities Act 1997 increased the size of the Senate and devolved power from it to the constituent universities.

The NUI&#x27;s Convocation comprises the Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor, the Members of Senate, the Professors and Lecturers, and the Graduates of the University. Eight Members of the NUI Senate are elected by its Convocation, for terms of five years.

===Chancellor===
The chancellor is the notional head of the university, and constituent universities and recognised colleges have their own heads, who exercise most powers in practice. When the university was established in 1908 by Royal Charter, the first chancellor was appointed; all subsequent chancellors are elected by convocation, as set out in university statutes. The chancellor is elected by graduates and staff whenever there is a vacancy.

<doc id="277552" wikidata="Q917709" url="?curid=277552" title="Hundred Days' Reform">
<text>The Hundred Days&#x27; Reform or Wuxu Reform () was a failed 103-day national, cultural, political, and educational reform movement that occurred from 11 June to 22 September 1898 during the late Qing dynasty. It was undertaken by the young Guangxu Emperor and his reform-minded supporters. Following the issuing of the reformative edicts, a &quot;coup d&#x27;√©tat&quot; (Wuxu Coup) was perpetrated by powerful conservative opponents led by Empress Dowager Cixi. While Empress Dowager Cixi supported the principles of the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, she feared that sudden implementation, without bureaucratic support, would be disruptive and that the Japanese and other foreign powers would take advantage of any weakness. She later backed the late Qing reforms after the invasions of the Eight-Nation Alliance.

==Beginning==

China embarked on an effort to modernize, the Self-Strengthening Movement, following its defeat in the First (1839‚Äì1842) and Second (1856‚Äì1860) Opium Wars. The effort concentrated on providing the armed forces with modern weapons, rather than reforming governance or society. The limitations of this approach were exposed by the First Sino-Japanese War (1894‚Äì1895) when China was defeated by Meiji Japan, which had undergone comprehensive reforms during the same period. The defeat led to additional unequal treaties as European powers took advantage of China&#x27;s weakness. As Tan Sitong (Ë≠öÂó£Âêå), Kang Youwei (Â∫∑ÊúâÁà≤), and Liang Qichao (Ê¢ÅÂïìË∂Ö) saw the utter destruction and political problems of China at this time, such as political division, insurrection, opium addiction (due to the opium wars) and foreign conflicts. Therefore, they developed influential philosophical systems for creating solutions which enacted political reform and a new Chinese reformist movement.

Elements of the Qing government were sufficiently alarmed to permit Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao to propose reforms to Emperor Guangxu; Guangxu agreed. Some of Kang&#x27;s students were also given minor but strategic posts in the capital to assist with the reforms. The goals of these reforms included:

* Abolishing the traditional examination system
* Eliminating sinecures (positions that provided little or no work but provided a salary)
* Establishing Peking University as a place where sciences, liberal arts and the Chinese classics would all be available for study
* Establishing agricultural schools in all provinces and schools and colleges in all provinces and cities
* Building a modern education system (studying mathematics and science instead of focusing mainly on Confucian texts)
* Encouraging imperial family members to study abroad
* Transitioning to a constitutional monarchy
* Applying principles of capitalism to strengthen the economy
* Modernizing the military and adopting modern training and drill methods
* Establishing a naval academy
* Utilizing unused military land for farming
* Rapid industrialization through manufacturing, commerce, and capitalism
* Establishing trade schools for the manufacture of silk, tea, and other traditional crafts
* Establishing a bureau for railways and mines

The reformers declared that China needed more than &quot;self-strengthening&quot; and that innovation must be accompanied by institutional and ideological change.

Opposition to the reforms was intense among the conservative ruling elite who condemned it as too radical and proposed a more moderate and gradualist alternatives. Conservatives like Prince Duan suspected a foreign plot due to the introduction into the Qing government of foreign advisors like Timothy Richards and Ito Hirobumi; Duan wanted to expel foreigners completely from China.

In addition to the reforms, the reformers plotted to forcefully remove Empress Dowager Cixi from power. Tan Sitong asked Yuan Shikai to kill Ronglu, take control of the garrison at Tientsin, and then march on Beijing and arrest Cixi. However, Yuan had previously promised to support Ronglu; rather than kill him, Yuan informed Ronglu of the plot.

==End==
With the support of the conservatives and the armed forces commanded by Yuan and Ronglu, Cixi launched a &quot;coup d&#x27;√©tat&quot; on September 22, 1898, and took over the government. Guangxu was put under house arrest on the Yingtai Island until his death in 1908. 

The reforms were reversed and their chief advocates ‚Äì the &quot;Six Gentlemen of Wuxu&quot; (ÊàäÊàåÂÖ≠ÂêõÂ≠ê): Tan Sitong, Kang Guangren (Kang Youwei&#x27;s brother), Lin Xu, Yang Shenxiu, Yang Rui, and Liu Guangdi ‚Äì were ordered to be executed. Reforms such as the abolishing of the old writing style was put back into mandate, the removal of offices and agencies were reinstituted, and the establishment of certain newspapers, civil societies and schools were all suspended. The two principal leaders, Kang Youwei and his student Liang Qichao, fled to Japan to seek refuge where they founded Baohuang Hui (Protect the Emperor Society) and worked, unsuccessfully, for a constitutional monarchy in China. Tan Sitong refused to flee and was executed. An alternative view is that Liang and Kang had a different objective for leaving for Japan which is to not only justify fleeing China but to also solicit intervention by foreign powers like Britain or Japan to rescue Emperor Guangxu.

During the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform, generals Dong Fuxiang, Ma Anliang, and Ma Haiyan were called to Beijing and helped put an end to the movement along with Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang. Dong Fuxiang and the Muslim Gansu Army stationed in Beijing during the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform later participated in the Boxer Rebellion and became known as the Kansu Braves.

==Aftermath==
The late Qing reforms attempted in the years following the Hundred Days included the abolition of the Imperial examination in 1905, educational and military modernization patterned after the model of Japan, and experiments in constitutional and parliamentary government. The ultimate failure of these reforms gave impetus to revolutionary forces within the country. Changes within the establishment were seen to be largely hopeless, and the overthrow of the Qing increasingly appeared to be the only way to save China. Despite the late Qing reforms of the early 1900s, such sentiments directly contributed to the success of the Xinhai Revolution in 1911.

Leo Tolstoy corresponded with Gu Hongming on the Hundred Day&#x27;s Reform and agreed that the reform movement was ill-advised. The reformist Kang Party, formed by students of Kang and Liang, was one of the most alarming groups in the eyes of court conservatives at this time.

==Differing interpretations==
Views of the Hundred Days&#x27; Reform have grown increasingly more complex and nuanced. The traditional view portrayed the reformers as heroes and the conservative elites, particularly the Empress Dowager Cixi, as villains unwilling to reform because of their selfish interests.

===Failure as Kang&#x27;s responsibility===
However, some historians in the late 20th century have taken views that are more favorable to the conservatives and less favorable to the reformers. In this view, Kang Youwei and his allies were hopeless dreamers unaware of the political realities in which they operated. This view argues that the conservative elites were not opposed to change and that practically all of the reforms that were proposed were eventually implemented.

For example, Sterling Seagrave, in his book &quot;The Dragon Lady&quot;, argues that there were several reasons why the reforms failed. Chinese political power at the time was firmly in the hands of the ruling Manchu nobility. The highly xenophobic iron hats faction dominated the Grand Council and were seeking ways to expel all Western influence from China. When implementing reform, the Guangxu Emperor by-passed the Grand Council and appointed four reformers to advise him. These reformers were chosen after a series of interviews, including the interview of Kang Youwei, who was rejected by the Emperor and had far less influence than Kang&#x27;s later boasting would indicate. At the suggestion of the reform advisors, the Guangxu Emperor also held secret talks with former Japanese Prime Minister It≈ç Hirobumi with the aim of using his experience in the Meiji Restoration to lead China through similar reforms.

It has also been suggested, controversially, that Kang Youwei actually did a great deal of harm to the cause by his perceived arrogance in the eyes of the conservatives. Numerous rumors regarding potential repercussions, many of them false, had made their way to the Grand Council; this was one of the factors in their decision to stage a coup against the Emperor. Kang, like many of the reformers, grossly underestimated the reactionary nature of the vested interests involved.

The Emperor set about to enact his reforms by largely bypassing the powerful Grand Council; said councilors, irritated at the Emperor&#x27;s actions and fearful of losing the political power they had, then turned to the Empress Dowager Cixi to remove the emperor from power. Many, though not all, of the reforms came to naught. The council, now confident in their power, pushed for the execution of the reformers, an action that was carried out ruthlessly.

===Richard&#x27;s federation theory===
According to Professor Lei Chia-sheng (Èõ∑ÂÆ∂ËÅñ), Japanese former prime minister It≈ç Hirobumi (‰ºäËó§ÂçöÊñá) arrived in China on September 11, 1898, about the same time that Kang Youwei invited British missionary Timothy Richard to Beijing. Richard suggested that China appoint It≈ç as one of many foreign advisors in order to further push China&#x27;s reform efforts. On September 18, Richard successfully convinced Kang to adopt his plan in which China would join a federation (ÂêàÈÇ¶) of ten nations.

Kang nonetheless asked fellow reformers Yang Shenxiu (Ê•äÊ∑±ÁßÄ) and Song Bolu (ÂÆã‰ºØÈ≠Ø) to report this plan to the Guangxu Emperor. On September 20, Yang sent a memorial to the emperor to that effect. In another memorial to the Emperor written the next day, Song advocated the formation of a federation and the sharing of the diplomatic, fiscal, and military powers of the four countries under a hundred-man committee. Lei Chia-sheng argues that this idea was the reason why Cixi, who had just returned from the Summer Palace on September 19, decided to put an end to the reforms with the September 21 coup.

On October 13, following the coup, British ambassador Claude MacDonald reported to his government that Chinese reforms had been &quot;much injured&quot; by Kang and his friends&#x27; actions. However, the British and American governments had been largely unaware of the &quot;federation&quot; plot, which appears to have been Richard&#x27;s own personal idea. The Japanese government might have been aware of Richard&#x27;s plan, since his accomplice was the former Japanese prime minister, but there is no evidence to this effect yet.

<doc id="277553" wikidata="Q1138262" url="?curid=277553" title="Volkswagen Karmann Ghia">
<text>The Volkswagen Karmann Ghia are a family of three overlapping sports car models produced by Volkswagen, marketed in 2+2 coupe (1955‚Äì1975) and 2+2 convertible (1957‚Äì1975) body styles, though German production ended one year before that in Brazil. Internally designated the Type 14 (1955‚Äì1975), the Type 34 (1962‚Äì1969), and the Type 145 TC (1972‚Äì1975; Brazil), the Karmann Ghia cars combined the floorpans and mechanicals of the Type¬†1 / Beetle or Type¬†3 &#x27;ponton&#x27; models with styling by Italy&#x27;s Carrozzeria Ghia, and hand-built bodywork by German coachbuilding house Karmann.

The 1955 Type 14 Karmann Ghia was just the second Volkswagen passenger car ever produced, after the Beetle, and launched six years &quot;before&quot; the Type¬†3 notchbacks, fastbacks and Variants (squarebacks). They were faster and more expensive than the Beetle, but very cramped in the back, despite their wider, postwar and nearly slabsided body design. Two years later, in 1957, a convertible was added.

In 1961, the Karmann Ghia briefly lost its title of fastest Volkswagen, upon launch of the more powerful 1500cc Type¬†3 models, but later that year, Volkswagen, Ghia, and Karmann presented an all new Karmann Ghia ‚Äì Type 34, using the Type¬†3&#x27;s floorpan and 1500cc powertrain. Made from 1962 to 1969, this had both new, more modern, angular and roomier bodywork; and a new, more luxurious interior, making it substantially more expensive than all other VW passenger cars. Additionally, the Type 34 was one of the world&#x27;s first cars with a power operated steel sunroof option. The Type 34 Karmann Ghia thus became VW&#x27;s range-topper again ‚Äì costing up to twice the price of a Beetle ‚Äì while the cheaper Type 14 remained in production. Only the latter offered a convertible.

Failure to offer the Type 34 in the United States ‚Äì the Karmann Ghia&#x27;s most important market ‚Äì combined with high pricing elsewhere likely contributed to limited sales, and after the type 14 also received the 1500cc engine in 1967, production of Type 34s was ended during 1969. Volkswagen of Brazil nevertheless looked for an alternative in its market segment, and so Carrozzeria Ghia was again commissioned, to design a &quot;third&quot; Karmann Ghia model, for the South American market, the Karmann Ghia TC (Touring Coup√©), made in Brazil from 1972‚Äì1975. The result was a stylish, rakish fastback that offered good interior space for a 2+2 car.

For its final model year, the vestigial rear seat in the Type 14 was discontinued for North American models, as it lacked provisions for seat belts; all Karmann Ghias for 1974 were marketed strictly as two-seaters.

More than 445,000 Karmann Ghias were produced in Germany over the car&#x27;s production life, not including the Type 34 variant. Volkswagen do Brasil (Volkswagen Brasil) produced 41,600 Type 34s in Brazil for South America between 1962 and 1975.

Long noted for its exterior styling, the Karmann Ghia was designed with input from numerous individuals at Carrozzeria Ghia and was strongly influenced by Virgil Exner&#x27;s work, though all of its designers passed without a definitive individual styling attribution.

== History ==
Three companies and numerous individuals came together in the history of the Karmann Ghia. In the early 1950s, Volkswagen was producing its Volkswagen Beetle, and as postwar standards of living increased, executives at Volkswagen were at least receptive to adding a halo model to its range, if not actively seeking an additional model. Luigi Segre was committed to expanding the international reputation of Carrozzeria Ghia. And Wilhelm Karmann had taken over his family coachbuilding firm Karmann and was eager to augment his contracts building Volkswagen&#x27;s convertible models.

Wilhelm Karmann and Luigi Segre often encountered each other at international automobile shows, and after an initial discussion prompted by Wilhelm Karmann, Segre secretly obtained a Volkswagen Beetle to use as a basis for a prototype ‚Äì Beetles were difficult to come by and Gian Paolo, Mario Boano&#x27;s son, purchased one in Paris and drove it back to Turin. Ghia customized its platform, designed the initial prototype and in five months constructed the model. Segre secretly presented the model to Wilhelm Karmann one year after the initial discussion ‚Äî late in 1953, in Paris, at the Societ√© France Motors factories (Volkswagen&#x27;s dealership for France and the exclusive European dealer of Ghia-built Chrysler models). When Wilhelm Karmann saw the coup√©, Karmann said, &quot;I&#x27;d like to build that!&quot; As the head of Ghia, Segre singularly directed the project through conception and prototyping, delivering a feasible project that Willhelm Karmann both wanted to and could practically build ‚Äî the project Wilhelm Karmann would in turn present to Volkswagen.
The styling of the vehicle, however, integrated work by Segre as well as Mario Boano, Sergio Coggiola and Giovanni Savonuzzi ‚Äî and at various times they each took credit for the design. 
Furthermore, the design bore striking styling similarities to Virgil Exner&#x27;s Chrysler &quot;D&#x27;Elegance&quot; and K-310 concepts, which Ghia had been tasked with prototyping ‚Äî and which in turn reflected numerous cues and themes developed previously by Mario Boano. According to Virgil Exner&#x27;s son, Virgil M. Exner Jr., Giovanni Savonuzzi was tasked with scaling down the full-sized d‚ÄôElegance, replacing &quot;the Chrysler‚Äôs egg-crate grille with a gentle, boat-like prow. Exner Jr. is further quoted as saying that the Karmann Ghia &quot;was a direct, intentional swipe off the Chrysler D&#x27;Elegance. Giovanni Savonuzzi was the engineer and designer who downsized the D&#x27;Elegance and made the Karmann Ghia out of it. Nobody minded it. It was wonderful.&quot;

The precise styling responsibilities were not well-documented at the time, before the passing of the various designers, further complicated by the overlapping work of the key players. A definitive individual attribution on Karmann Ghia&#x27;s styling was never made.

Segre and Virgil Exner became close professionally and personally, eventually traveling Europe together. Peter Grist wrote in his 2007 Exner biography that when Exner in 1955 eventually saw the Karmann Ghia, which cribbed heavily from his Chrysler d&#x27;Elegance, &quot;he was pleased with the outcome and glad that one of his designs had made it into large-scale production.&quot; Chris Voss, a stylist in Exner&#x27;s office, reported in 1993, that Exner considered the Karmann Ghia the ultimate form of flattery. Segre in turn sent Exner the first production Karmann Ghia imported into the state of Michigan, in gratitude.

After Volkswagen approved the design in November 1953, the Karmann Ghia debuted (at the 1955 Paris and Frankfurt auto shows and at the Kasino Hotel in Westfalia, Germany, on July 14, 1955) and went into production, first at Ghia and then in Osnabr√ºck ‚Äî ultimately to reach a production over 445,000, running 19 years virtually unchanged.

==Production==
The design and prototype were well received by Volkswagen executives, and the Type 14 debuted at the October 1953 Paris Auto Show as a styling concept &quot;by Ghia.&quot; In August 1955 the first Type 14 was manufactured in Osnabr√ºck, Germany. Public reaction to the Type 14 exceeded expectations, and more than 10,000 were sold in the first year.

In contrast to the Beetle&#x27;s machine-welded body with bolt-on fenders, the Karmann Ghia&#x27;s body panels were butt-welded, hand-shaped, and smoothed with English pewter in a time-consuming process commensurate with higher-end manufacturers, resulting in the Karmann Ghia&#x27;s higher price.

The Type 14 was marketed as a practical and stylish 2+2 rather than as a true sports car. As they shared engines, the Type 14&#x27;s engine displacement grew concurrently with the Type 1 (Beetle), ultimately arriving at a displacement of 1584¬†cc, producing .

Production doubled soon after the Karmann Ghia&#x27;s U.S. introduction, becoming the car most imported into the U.S.

In August 1957, Volkswagen introduced a convertible version of the Karmann Ghia. Exterior changes in 1961 included wider and finned front grilles, taller and more rounded rear taillights and headlights relocated to a higher position ‚Äì with previous models and their lower headlight placement called &quot;lowlights&quot;. The Italian designer Sergio Sartorelli, designer of Type 34, oversaw the various restylings of Type 14.

In 1970, larger taillights integrated the reversing lights and larger wrap-around turn signals. Still larger and wider taillights increased side visibility. In 1972, large square-section bumpers replaced the smooth round originals, and tail lights were again enlarged. For the USA model only, 1973 modifications mandated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) included energy-absorbing bumpers. A carpeted package shelf replaced the rear seat.

In late 1974 the car was superseded by the Golf-based Scirocco.


== Type 34 Karmann Ghia ==

In September 1961, based on the new VW 1500 (Type 3) &#x27;ponton&#x27; models introduced that same year, Volkswagen also introduced a new VW 1500 Karmann Ghia model (Type 34), with a new body, designed by Italian engineer Sergio Sartorelli, positioned above the Beetle-based Karmann Ghia 1200 and 1300 models. Featuring more angular 1960s styling, the 1500 offered greater interior and cargo room, in three luggage spaces, than the first generation Karmann Ghia, despite unchanged wheelbase-length. Based on the new 1500&#x27;s platform, with its new, bigger and more powerful 1500cc engine, the Type 34 was the fastest production Volkswagen of its day.

In 1962, an electrically operated sliding steel sunroof option was added ‚Äì only the second automobile model in the world to have this option. The Karmann Ghia 1500 further featured round tail lights, built-in fog lights, an electric clock, upper and lower dash pads, door pads, and long padded armrests.

Due to model confusion once the original Type 14 Karmann Ghia was also introduced with the 1500 motor in 1967, the Type 34 was indicated variously as &quot;Der Gro√üe Karmann&quot; (&quot;the big Karmann&quot;) in Germany, &quot;Razor Edge Ghia&quot; in the United Kingdom, or &quot;European Ghia&quot; (or &quot;Type 3 Ghia&quot; among enthusiasts) in the United States. Today the name Type 34 is recognized as the worldwide naming convention.

Until it was replaced by the VW-Porsche 914, it was the most expensive and luxurious passenger car VW manufactured in the 1960s ‚Äî at the time costing twice as much as a Beetle in many markets. 42,505 (plus 17 prototype convertibles) were manufactured from 1962‚Äì1969.

Although the Type 34 was available in most countries, it was not offered officially in the U.S.¬†‚Äì VW&#x27;s largest and most important export market¬†‚Äì another reason for its low sales numbers. Nevertheless, many made their way to the USA (most via Canada), and the USA now has the largest number of known Type 34s left in the world (400 of the total 1,500 to 2,000 or so remaining).

Like the earlier Type 14, the Type 34 was styled by the Italian design studio Ghia. There are some similar styling influences, but the Type 34 Ghia looks very different from the Type 14. The chassis is also a major difference between the cars; the Type 14 shares its chassis with a Beetle (though with a wider floorpan), whereas the Type 34 body is mounted on a Type 3 floorpan and drivetrain (the same as a 1500/1600 Notchback, Fastback or Variant (Squareback))¬†‚Äì all featuring the 1500 &#x27;pancake&#x27; engine that allowed a front and rear boot. This makes the Type 34 &quot;mechanically&quot; the same as other Type 3s. However, all bodywork and bumpers, the interior, glass, and most of the lenses are all unique to the Type 34. The car has wider 6.00-15 crossply tyres, until 1968 when they moved to 165R15 Pirelli Cinturato.

The Wilhelm Karmann factory assembly line which assembled the Type 34, since then also produced the VW-Porsche 914 (known as Porsche 914 in the USA), the Type 34&#x27;s successor as the fastest VW.

== Karmann Ghia TC ==


As an alternative to the Type 34 Karmann-Ghia coup√©, which Volkswagen had introduced to Europe in 1961, Volkswagen do Brasil looked to Ghia in Turin for a reworked version of the Type 14 at the end of the 1960s. At the time Ghia employed the now famous Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro, who was set to work on the new Brazilian Karmann Ghia. The result was the &quot;Volkswagen Karmann Ghia TC&quot; (Touring Coup√©), internally known as the Type 145, which began production in 1971 and was produced until 1975.

This was a roomy 2+2 coupe with a modern and comfortable interior. Underneath, it still shared components with the Type 14, but the TC used the platform of the VW 1600 Type 3 / Variant models instead of the Beetle&#x27;s floorpan. The main difference was the engine: the Type 145 TC was fitted with the 1,584¬†cc flat-four air-cooled boxer unit from the Type¬†3 instead of the 1200cc units of the Type 14. The car produced at 4,600 rpm and had a top speed of , compared to the and top speed of the Type 14 Karmann Ghia.

18,119 TC models were sold during their production that began at the turn of 1970 until the end of their sales in 1976. It was offered only in South America and was not exported off the continent. There is a prototype that is part of the factory museum collection of Karmann in Osnabr√ºck, Germany.

== Subsequent concepts ==
In 1990, Karmann introduced a Karmann Ghia-inspired concept car ‚Äì the Karmann Coupe ‚Äì at the Frankfurt Motor Show, and in April 2013 Karmann Ghia do Brasil launched a competition for Brazilian students to design a modern interpretation of the classic Volkswagen Karmann-Ghia Coup√©, possibly leading to the development of a prototype.

<text>Queenstown is a town in the West Coast region of the island of Tasmania, Australia. It is in a valley on the western slopes of Mount Owen on the West Coast Range.

At the , Queenstown had a population of 1,808 people.

== History ==
Queenstown&#x27;s history has long been tied to the mining industry. This mountainous area was first explored in 1862. It was not long after that when alluvial gold was discovered at Mount Lyell, prompting the formation of the Mount Lyell Gold Mining Company in 1881. In 1892, the mining company began searching for copper. The final name of the Mount Lyell company was the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company.

Early in 1895 a Post Office was opened at Penghana, at the Queen River fork and crossing, about a kilometre north of present-day Queenstown on the road to Strahan; James Robertson was appointed the first postmaster. The only other substantial building nearby was Robertson &amp; Hunter&#x27;s store. 
Queenstown Post Office opened on 21 November 1896 and the Penghana office closed; Miss Mylan was the first postmaster. The present-day Queenstown Post Office dates from 1902 and is heritage-listed. The name &quot;Penghana&quot; was adopted for a substantial house nearby, from around 1925‚Äì1944 the residence of Mount Lyell mine manager R. M. Murray, and persists today as Penghana Road.

A Queenstown South office opened in 1949 and closed in 1973.

In the 1900s, Queenstown was the centre of the Mount Lyell mining district and had numerous smelting works, brick-works, and sawmills. The area at the time was heavily wooded. The population in 1900 was 5051; the district, 10,451. 

The town was the base of the Queenstown Council until its amalgamation with other west coast councils in the 1990s. The town, in its heyday, had a collection of hotels, theatres, churches and schools that have largely disappeared since the demise of the Mount Lyell company.

The town was the base of the Organisation for Tasmanian Development started in 1982.

There was a brief boom in prosperity in the 1980s, with the building of several nearby dams by the Hydro. The Darwin and Crotty dams that comprise Lake Burbury (a popular fishing and recreation venue) were built during this period. These followed the cancellation of the Gordon-below-Franklin Dam in 1983 after strong campaigning by environmentalists in the &#x27;No Dams&#x27; campaign.

==Ecology==

The mountains surrounding Queenstown have unusual pink and grey hues that come from the conglomerate rocks on the two most adjacent mountains - Mount Lyell and Mount Owen. The mountains surrounding Queenstown are often snowcapped through winter. Snow falls a few days out of the year.

Owing to a combination of tree removal for use in the smelters and the smelter fumes (for about 40 years), and the heavy annual rainfall, the erosion of the shallow horizon topsoil back to the harder rock profile contributed to the stark state of the mountains for many decades.

Typical of the successions that occur in fire affected areas in Western Tasmania, the low shrubbery that has revegetated adjacent to hillside creeks is a very early stage of a long recovery for the ecology of the region.

Some concern by local residents in the 1980s, and since, that the low-level succession of plants might affect the stark &#x27;moonscape&#x27; appearance of the southern parts of Mount Lyell, and northern Mount Owen. Although there are still large areas incapable of sustaining regrowth due to the acute slopes and lack of soil formation, revegetation projects have been stymied.

The Queen River was for most of the history of the Mount Lyell company the recipient of mining effluent and the Queenstown sewage - which then continued into the King River and consequently the Macquarie Harbour.

The Mount Lyell Remediation and Research and Demonstration Program scheme has since removed the direct flowing mining waste and local waste from the rivers.

== Current conditions ==

Today, the town and district attracts significant numbers of tourists, on either organised tours or the hire car &#x27;circuit&#x27; around Tasmania. The grand Empire Hotel overlooks the revived steam train station where rides to neighbouring Strahan are available through dense rainforest. The recent addition of mountain bike trails and white water rafting add to the town&#x27;s growth as a tourist destination. Some older features continue to fascinate tourists, either the mountains, the slag heap, and the gravel football ground. There are significant opportunities to catch glimpses of the town&#x27;s past at the local museum, and simply by driving up Orr Street the old main street with the dominant Post Office tower.

The mining operation at the original Mount Lyell mine continues, with Copper Mines of Tasmania operating between 1995 and 1999 independently, after which it became part of an Indian company group - and its concentrates are shipped to India for processing. In 2021, Indian mining company Vedanta Limited divested its copper mining activities in Queenstown.

Exploration continues within the West Coast region for further economic mineral deposits, and due to the complexity of the geology, there is always the possibility that new mines will open: the Henty Gold Mine is a good example as it commenced operation in the 1990s.

Queenstown is the terminus of the West Coast Wilderness Railway, which travels southwards alongside the Queen River, and then along the northern slopes of the King River to the port of Strahan in Macquarie Harbour.

==Queenstown Oval==

Queenstown is well known for its unique football oval, which utilises gravel instead of grass. The Queenstown Oval was laid with gravel due to pollution from local mining and heavy rain making it difficult to grow grass. The oval was inducted into the Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Queenstown Heritage and Arts Festival==
The &quot;Queenstown Heritage and Arts Festival&quot; was the first name of a biennial festival that celebrates Queenstown&#x27;s history.
One significant historical event it has celebrated was the centenary of the 1912 North Mount Lyell Disaster in the second festival in October 2012.
In the third festival in October 2014, the Hydro Tasmania centenary was a major component.

With key events taking place at The Paragon Theatre, the festival rebranded as the Unconformity Festival in 2016.

== Climate ==
Queenstown has a very wet oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), and is one of the wettest locations in Tasmania with an annual average rainfall of 2408.2¬†mm (94.8¬†in), spread throughout the year but especially concentrated in winter. Summers are cool to mild and prone to cold fronts off the Roaring Forties, although temperatures can occasionally rise above 30¬†¬∞C, while winters are cool to cold and almost always cloudy; however, during rare clear spells overnight temperatures can drop well below freezing. Brief, light snow usually occurs several times each winter, with occasional heavier snow falling every few years. Queenstown is very cloudy, getting only 29.0 days of clear skies annually.

==Demographics==
At the , Queenstown had a population of 1,808 people (929 males and 878 females). The median age was 47. Children aged 0‚Äì14 years made up 15.3% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 22.3% of the population.

According to the , the most common responses for religion in Queenstown were No Religion (40.5%), Catholic (22.0%), Anglican (16.7%), and Uniting Church (3.1%). Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.7% of the population.

The median weekly personal income for people aged 15 years and over in Queenstown was $509 while the median weekly incomes for families and households were $1,371 and $851 respectively.

<doc id="277556" wikidata="Q345294" url="?curid=277556" title="Nate Mendel">
<text>Nathan ‚ÄçGregor ‚ÄçMendel (born December 2, 1968) is an American musician who is the bass guitarist for the rock band Foo Fighters, as well as a former member of Sunny Day Real Estate. He has also worked with musical acts The Jealous Sound and The Fire Theft. He has released one solo album, &quot;If I Kill This Thing We&#x27;re All Going to Eat for a Week&quot;, under the name Lieutenant. Though not a founding member, he is the longest-serving member of the band after lead vocalist and guitarist Dave Grohl, and has appeared on every album by the group since &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Mendel was born in Richland, a mid-sized city in southeast Washington. His first instrument was the violin. At the age of 13, Mendel started to get interested in rock music and joined a band, a friend who played guitar suggesting he play the bass. Mendel stated that &quot;as I picked up that bass I went on a 20-year detour into punk&quot;, helped by his town usually having concerts of DIY punk bands such as Scream. This led to a &quot;pretty limited musical education&quot;, as despite taking some lessons with a bassist from a local band, Mendel mostly taught himself to play, and &quot;it was all hardcore punk rock, like Minor Threat, Black Flag and Bad Brains. Instead of studying the bass playing of someone like John Entwistle, which would have given me a foundation of how to play. I just wanted to play a lot of notes fast.&quot; His family is Jewish.

Mendel began his musical career in the hardcore band Diddly Squat, which only recorded a 7&quot; single but did a national tour during the 1988 summer vacation. After Diddly Squat ended, Mendel moved to Seattle, where he spent four months on the straight edge band Brotherhood. Afterward, he joined the band Christ on a Crutch, which included bandmate Glen Essary and lasted until 1993. In 1992, Mendel and his University of Washington housemate Dan Hoerner decided to form a band, and invited drummer William Goldsmith to form the group that would end up being named Sunny Day Real Estate (SDRE). Mendel added that SDRE was an attempt to &quot;play more intricate, interesting music&quot;. While Mendel toured Europe with Christ on a Crutch, Jeremy Enigk jammed with the remaining members and eventually became a full-time member of SDRE.

Just before Sunny Day Real Estate disbanded in 1995, Mendel and Goldsmith were invited by Dave Grohl to join his band, the Foo Fighters, during the week of Halloween in late October 1994. He has remained a bandmember ever since, being one of the only original members in the Foo Fighters&#x27; current lineup along with Grohl and former Nirvana live guitarist Pat Smear. Although Sunny Day Real Estate reunited for two more albums (&quot;How It Feels to Be Something On&quot; and &quot;The Rising Tide&quot;), he stayed with the Foo Fighters, in Sunny Day Real Estate, he was replaced by Jeff Palmer, and Palmer was replaced by Joe Skyward, when Skyward left the band, Jeremy Enigk (lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist, and keyboardist) moved to the bass. After Sunny Day Real Estate disbanded once more, he joined with other Sunny Day Real Estate members Jeremy Enigk and William Goldsmith to form The Fire Theft, who released a self-titled album in 2003. In 2001, he played with Juno.

He scored a role in the indie movie &quot;Our Burden Is Light&quot;, in which he also played a minor role as the main female character&#x27;s best friend&#x27;s boyfriend and bassist. In the movie, Mendel plays in a band named Bleeder, consisting of himself, Jessica Ballard, and Taylor Hawkins.

In June 2009, it was confirmed that Sunny Day Real Estate plans to reunite again, with Mendel back in the fold. The band toured in 2009, confirming a new album in the works. However, recording sessions proved to be unproductive and by 2013, the group had broken up once again.

== Technique ==

Mendel at first considered the bass a melodic instrument, and thus liked to input more personality in his bass parts. &quot;Bass Player&quot; described Mendel&#x27;s style in Sunny Day Real Estate as &quot;heavy-handed and fleet-footed, rooted in punk rock but prone to melodic flights that encircled the band&#x27;s airy arrangements&quot;, and Mendel added that in his first years of the Foo Fighters he tried &quot;to make these songs as complicated as I could and put as much bass on there as possible&quot;. He eventually changed his priorities to the more traditional bass style where the instrument acts as &quot;the bridge between the melodic element and the percussion&quot;, saying that he &quot;alter[ed] the way I play bass so it works in this band, so I can support Dave&#x27;s songs as best as possible.&quot; The priorities he learned to take with his playing was to &quot;play tight and lock better with the drums&quot; adding that when Grohl and drummer Taylor Hawkins decide to redo the drum tracks, at times Mendel would have to remake his whole basslines.

Mendel is known to use a pick almost exclusively. His preferred style was alternate picking, but on the fifth Foo Fighters album, &quot;In Your Honor&quot;, he started to employ downpicking because &quot;with this kind of music, you need the consistency and percussive sound you get from playing with downstrokes.&quot; For the acoustic shows, Mendel played fingerstyle.

== Equipment ==
Mendel&#x27;s main set-up consists of Fender Precision Basses with GHS strings, played through Ashdown amplifiers. Mendel described the Precision as &quot;iconic&quot; in both its looks and its sound. The bassist&#x27;s preferred P-Bass is his first, a 1971 model sold to him by the lead singer of Christ on a Crutch which Mendel adapted to be easier to play. Mendel also plays Lakland basses, particularly the Bob Glaub Signature, one of which was employed on the Foo Fighters&#x27; seventh album, &quot;Wasting Light&quot;. He uses a Fulltone Bassdrive pedal, though Mendel downsized the usage of effects pedals as the Foo Fighters rose its number of musicians ‚Äì &quot;Now that we have three guitar players, there&#x27;s a lot of distortion going on, so I try to keep it clean and stay in line with the kick drum. That way, I know that even if we&#x27;re playing a big echoey venue, at least the bass will come across with some bite and precision.&quot; In 2012, Mendel received his own signature Fender Nate Mendel Precision Bass, which has become popular globally due to it being a very well built, simply modified vintage style Precision Bass.

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===
Mendel met Kate Jackson, co-founder of independent public relations firm Grandstand Media, in 2009 while she was director of marketing and publicity at Sub Pop Records and Mendel was touring as part of a reunion of the original lineup of Sub Pop recording artists Sunny Day Real Estate. They were married on October 11, 2014, accompanied by close friends and family including Mendel&#x27;s Foo Fighters bandmates. On July 19, 2018, Mendel took a one-show leave of absence from the Foo Fighters&#x27; Concrete &amp; Gold tour, with Jane&#x27;s Addiction bassist Chris Chaney filling in for him for one night at the PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh, as he chose to be with Jackson as she gave birth to the couple&#x27;s twin girls.

=== HIV/AIDS denialism ===
Mendel has expressed fringe views on HIV &amp; AIDS. In January 2000, he organized a sold-out concert in Los Angeles to benefit Alive &amp; Well AIDS Alternatives, an HIV/AIDS denialism group. In April 2000, MTV News reported that &quot;The Foo Fighters have gone on record advocating Alive &amp; Well, an alternative AIDS information group that questions the link between HIV and AIDS.&quot; The Centers for Disease Control describe AIDS as the &quot;most severe stage of HIV.&quot; Sandra Thurman, then director of the Office of National AIDS Policy commented:For the Foo Fighters to be promoting this is extraordinarily irresponsible behavior. There is no doubt about the link between HIV and AIDS in the respected scientific community and it&#x27;s quite unfortunate that a band reads one book and then adopts this theory. To say [that HIV does not cause AIDS] is akin to saying the world is flat. Responding to coverage of the Alive &amp; Well benefit in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine, Mendel wrote, &quot;I am not a medical professional, and I am relatively new to these questions, but I am convinced that those who have tested HIV positive and those sick with AIDS are being done a disservice by not having all the information available to them.&quot; Links and references to Alive &amp; Well were removed from the band&#x27;s website by March 2003.

<text>William Goldsmith (born July 4, 1972) is an American drummer who is a member of Sunny Day Real Estate and Assertion, and a former member of Foo Fighters. 
He has toured with Mike Watt and IQU, and played live with several bands and artists.

==Early years==
Goldsmith was born in Seattle, Washington to Hugh and Skitty Goldsmith. He began playing drums as a child, after being introduced by his older brother to bands such as The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Elvis Costello and the Attractions, and Talking Heads. Goldsmith has stated that he wanted to be John Lennon, but also a drummer, and has cited Keith Moon of The Who as his biggest influence on the instrument. During fifth grade, Goldsmith formed his first band, Screaming Hormones. In high school, Goldsmith formed a duo called the 13 with John Atkins, and later formed the hardcore punk band Reason for Hate with his friend Jeremy Enigk, whom he had previously invited to be the bassist for the 13. After Goldsmith graduated from high school, Greg Williamson invited him to the band Positive Greed. Afterwards Goldsmith worked on many ensembles, at times being a member of four bands simultaneously. He also expanded his tastes in music, becoming a fan of post-hardcore bands such as Fugazi, and of Nirvana&#x27;s debut album &quot;Bleach&quot;.

==Career==
===Sunny Day Real Estate (1992‚Äì1995)===
In 1992, Goldsmith was invited by bassist Nate Mendel and singer-guitarist Dan Hoerner to play with their band. Despite being a part of many projects, Goldsmith accepted due to their tenacity and strong focus. The band went through many names, such as Empty Set, Chewbacca Kaboom and One Day I Stopped Breathing, before settling down on Sunny Day Real Estate. Afterwards the trio recorded a single, &quot;Flatland Spider&quot;.

As Mendel left temporarily to tour with another band, Goldsmith invited Enigk to jam with him and Hoerner. Enigk was then added to the band, and soon became their new frontman. They recorded two studio albums, both released on the well-known independent label Sub Pop, that were greeted with positive critical reviews and brought about newfound popularity for the emo genre before they disbanded in 1995.

===Foo Fighters (1994‚Äì1997)===
During one of Sunny Day Real Estate&#x27;s last concerts, former Nirvana member Dave Grohl left the band a note. Goldsmith called him back, and Grohl invited both Goldsmith and Mendel to join his new band, Foo Fighters, along with former Germs and touring Nirvana guitarist Pat Smear, during late October 1994. In 1995, they embarked on a club tour supporting Mike Watt along with Eddie Vedder&#x27;s side project Hovercraft. Afterwards, the band&#x27;s already recorded debut album ‚Äì on which Grohl had recorded nearly all instruments by himself ‚Äì was released. Goldsmith stated that while he enjoyed the smaller venues, &quot;pretty much everything after that blew,&quot; saying that as the band got bigger &quot;it turned into a world-domination thing that became really creatively stifling&quot; and he grew tired of reproducing songs he had no input composing. Goldsmith also developed carpal tunnel syndrome after the tour.

After touring through the spring of 1996, the full lineup entered a Seattle studio with producer Gil Norton to record the band&#x27;s second album. It was an arduous and mostly frustrating process for Goldsmith due to Grohl&#x27;s perfectionism, which led to the drummer performing his tracks over and over. &quot;Dave had me do 96 takes of one song, and I had to do thirteen hours&#x27; worth of takes on another one. It just seemed that everything I did wasn&#x27;t good enough for him, or anyone else.&quot; With the sessions nearly complete, the band took a break. According to Grohl, Goldsmith&#x27;s drumming had good moments but for the most part his performances did not meet Grohl‚Äôs standards. The band regrouped in Los Angeles in February 1997 and practically re-recorded the album‚Äîthis time with Grohl on drums‚Äîwithout informing Goldsmith about the overdub session. Goldsmith only later learned from Mendel that his contribution was being replaced. Feeling betrayed and unhappy with Grohl&#x27;s suggestion that he continue on as the band&#x27;s touring drummer only, Goldsmith decided to leave. He was replaced by Taylor Hawkins and the finished album, &quot;The Colour and the Shape&quot;, was released on May 20, 1997.

===Back with Sunny Day Real Estate (1997‚Äì2001)===
In 1997, Sub Pop had approached Hoerner and Enigk about releasing a compilation of Sunny Day Real Estate rarities. Instead, the band decided to reunite and release a new studio album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;How It Feels To Be Something On&quot;. While Goldsmith, who had by this time left Foo Fighters, took part in the reunion, Mendel remained with Foo Fighters. Goldsmith also drummed with Sunny Day Real Estate on their subsequent live album, which was their last recording for Sub Pop, and their 2000 studio album &quot;The Rising Tide&quot; (for Time Bomb Recordings). After completing an extensive tour of the United States, the band hoped to tour Europe for the first time, but Time Bomb could not afford to support such a tour; the label soon ceased operations, resulting in the band&#x27;s 2001 breakup.

===After Sunny Day Real Estate, other projects, and reunion (2001‚Äìpresent)===
After Sunny Day Real Estate disbanded for a second time, Goldsmith and Enigk formed The Fire Theft with original Sunny Day bassist Nate Mendel. An album and tour followed.

Around the same time, Goldsmith joined guitarist Billy Dolan, who had played on the Fire Theft album and tour, for a project called Varicocele. The band recorded about 30 songs, and presented them to Jonathan Poneman at Sub Pop, who declined to release them.

In 2008, Goldsmith formed Brawley Banks with Justin Schwartz and Jorum Young from Cobra High. In 2009 they played their first show.

In June 2009, it was confirmed that Sunny Day Real Estate would be reuniting once again with the original line-up. A tour began later that year. In early 2010, guitarist Dan Hoerner stated that a new album is in the works.

In December 2018, Goldsmith claimed on his Facebook page that the unfinished fifth Sunny Day Real Estate album remained &quot;silenced, abandoned and buried within the murkiest depths of David Grohl&#x27;s sock drawer.&quot; He would later clarify that he was referring to the Grohl-owned Studio 606 where the album sessions took place and were abandoned due to Jeremy Enigk not receiving &quot;the moral support as well as engineering that he deserved.&quot;

In 2020, Goldsmith&#x27;s new band Assertion signed to Spartan Records who released their debut album &#x27;Intermission&#x27; on April 9, 2021. The album was praised by outlets like Rolling Stone, who named it &quot;One of the Best Albums of 2021 So Far&quot; on June 11, 2021.

<doc id="277560" wikidata="Q320930" url="?curid=277560" title="Cao Wei">
<text>Wei () was one of the major dynastic states in China during the Three Kingdoms period. The state was established in 220 by Cao Pi based upon the foundations laid by his father Cao Cao during the end of the Han dynasty. Its capital was initially located at Xuchang, and was later moved to Luoyang.

The name &quot;Wei&quot; first became associated with Cao Cao when he was named the Duke of Wei by the Eastern Han government in 213, and became the name of the state when Cao Pi proclaimed himself emperor in 220. Historians often add the prefix &quot;Cao&quot; to distinguish it from other Chinese states known as &quot;Wei&quot;. The authority of the ruling Cao family dramatically weakened following the deposition and execution of Cao Shuang, a regent for the dynasty&#x27;s third emperor Cao Fang. Beginning in 249, another regent in Sima Yi gradually consolidated state authority for himself and his relatives, with the last Wei emperors largely being puppets of the Sima family. In 266, Sima Yi&#x27;s grandson Sima Yan forced Emperor Yuan to abdicate, proclaiming himself to be emperor of the newly established Jin dynasty; he would be posthumously known as Emperor Wu (of Jin).

==History==
===Beginnings and founding===
Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, northern China came under the control of Cao Cao, the chancellor to the last Han ruler, Emperor Xian. In 213, Emperor Xian granted Cao Cao the title of &quot;Duke of Wei&quot; (È≠èÂÖ¨) and gave him ten cities as his dukedom. The area was named &quot;Wei&quot;. At that time, the southern part of China was divided into two areas controlled by two other warlords, Liu Bei and Sun Quan. In 216, Emperor Xian promoted Cao Cao to the status of a vassal king ‚Äì &quot;King of Wei (È≠èÁéã)&quot;.

Cao Cao died on 15 March 220 and his vassal king title was inherited by his son Cao Pi. Later that year, on 11 December, Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to abdicate in his favour and took over the throne, establishing the state of Wei. However, Liu Bei immediately contested Cao Pi&#x27;s claim to the Han throne and declared himself &quot;Emperor of Han&quot; a year later. Sun Quan was nominally a vassal king under Wei, but he declared independence in 222 and eventually proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor of Wu&quot; in 229.

To distinguish the state from other historical Chinese states of the same name, historians have added a relevant character to the state&#x27;s original name: the state that called itself &quot;Wei&quot; (È≠è) is also known as &quot;Cao Wei&quot; (ÊõπÈ≠è).

===Reigns of Cao Pi and Cao Rui===
Cao Pi ruled for six years until his death on 29 June 226 and was succeeded by his son, Cao Rui, who ruled until his death on 22 January 239. Throughout the reigns of Cao Pi and Cao Rui, Wei had been fighting numerous wars with its two rival states ‚Äì Shu and Wu.

Between 228 and 234, Zhuge Liang, the Shu chancellor and regent, led a series of five military campaigns to attack Wei&#x27;s western borders (within present-day Gansu and Shaanxi), with the aim of conquering Chang&#x27;an, a strategic city which lay on the road to the Wei capital, Luoyang. The Shu invasions were repelled by the Wei armies led by the generals Cao Zhen, Sima Yi, Zhang He and others; Shu did not make any significant gains in the expeditions.

On its southern and eastern borders, Wei engaged Wu in a series of armed conflicts throughout the 220s and 230s, including the battles of Dongkou (222‚Äì223), Jiangling (223) and Shiting (228). However, most of the battles resulted in stalemate and neither side managed to significantly expand its territory.

===Sima Yi&#x27;s Liaodong Campaign===
After Guanqiu Jian failed to subjugate the Gongsun clan of the Liaodong Commandery, it was Sima Yi who, in June 238, as the Grand Commandant (Â§™Â∞â), launched an invasion with 40,000 troops at the behest of Emperor Cao Rui against Liaodong, which at this point had been firmly rooted under Gongsun control for 4 decades. After a three-month long siege, involving some assistance from the Goguryeo Kingdom, Sima Yi managed to capture the capital city of Xiangping, resulting in the conquest of the commandery by late September of the same year.

===Goguryeo‚ÄìWei Wars===
Around that time, as the Korean kingdom Goguryeo consolidated its power, it proceeded to conquer the territories on the Korean peninsula which were under Chinese rule. Goguryeo initiated the Goguryeo‚ÄìWei Wars in 242, trying to cut off Chinese access to its territories in Korea by attempting to take a Chinese fort. However, Wei responded by invading and defeated Goguryeo. Hwando was destroyed in a reprisal raid by Wei forces in 244. The invasions sent its king fleeing, and broke the tributary relationships between Goguryeo and the other tribes of Korea that formed much of Goguryeo&#x27;s economy. Although the king evaded capture and eventually settled in a new capital, Goguryeo was reduced to such insignificance that for half a century there was no mention of the state in Chinese historical texts.

===Fall of Wei===
In 249, during the reign of Cao Rui&#x27;s successor, Cao Fang, the regent Sima Yi seized state power from his co-regent, Cao Shuang, in a coup. This event marked the collapse of imperial authority in Wei, as Cao Fang&#x27;s role had been reduced to that of a puppet ruler while Sima Yi wielded state power firmly in his hands. Wang Ling, a Wei general, tried to rebel against Sima Yi, but was swiftly dealt with, and took his own life. Sima Yi died on 7 September 251, passing on his authority to his eldest son, Sima Shi, who continued ruling as regent.

Sima Shi deposed Cao Fang in 254, on grounds of planning to stage a rebellion, and replaced him with Cao Mao. In response, Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin staged a rebellion, but were crushed by Sima Shi in an event that nevertheless took a heavy toll on Sima Shi&#x27;s health, having undergone eye surgery prior to the insurrection, causing him to die on 23 March 255, but not before handing his power and regency over to his younger brother, Sima Zhao.

In 258, Sima Zhao quelled Zhuge Dan&#x27;s rebellion, marking an end to what are known as the Three Rebellions in Shouchun. In 260, Cao Mao attempted to seize back state power from Sima Zhao in a coup, but was killed by Cheng Ji, a military officer who was serving under Jia Chong, a subordinate to the Simas. After Cao Mao&#x27;s death, Cao Huan was enthroned as the fifth ruler of Wei. However, Cao Huan was also a mere figurehead under Sima Zhao&#x27;s control, much like his predecessor. 
In 263, Wei armies led by Zhong Hui and Deng Ai conquered Shu. Afterwards, Zhong Hui and former Shu general Jiang Wei grouped and plotted together in order to oust Sima Zhao from power, however, various Wei officials turned against them when it was found out that Jiang Wei had urged Zhong Hui to get rid of these officials before the planned coup. Sima Zhao himself received and finally accepted the nine bestowals and the title &quot;Duke of Jin&quot; in 263, and was further bestowed with the title &quot;King of Jin&quot; by Cao Huan in 264, but he died on 6 September 265, leaving the final step of usurpation up to his eldest son, Sima Yan.

On 4 February 266, Sima Zhao&#x27;s son, Sima Yan, forced Cao Huan to abdicate in his favor, replacing Wei with the Jin dynasty on 8 February 266. Cao Huan himself was spared, though, and continued to live until 302, before dying.

==Government==
The system of government in Wei inherited many aspects from that of the Eastern Han dynasty. During his reign, Cao Pi established two separate government bodies ‚Äì the Central Inspectorate (‰∏≠Êõ∏Áõ£) and the Mobile Imperial Secretariat (Ë°åÂ∞öÊõ∏Ëá∫) ‚Äì to reduce the authority of the Imperial Secretariat (Â∞öÊõ∏Ëá∫) and consolidate the power of the central government.

During this time, the minister Chen Qun developed the nine-rank system for civil service nomination, which was adopted by later dynasties until it was superseded by the imperial examination system in the Sui dynasty.

Cao Pi felt that the Han dynasty collapsed because the Governors (Â∑ûÁâß) of the various provinces wielded too much power and fell outside the control of the central government. He reduced the role of a Governor to that of an Inspector (Âà∫Âè≤), and permitted the Inspectors to administer only civil affairs in their respective provinces, while military affairs were handled by military personnel based in regional offices or in the capital.

Cao Wei society was feudalized and vassalized. When China was divided in the Period of Disunion, south and north were economically and socially dominated by an aristocratic hereditary class enshrined in law, who were exempt from conscript labor, special kinds of taxes, had legal immunities and other privileges. This situation was created by Cao Wei with rigid social stratification backed by law between shu (Â∫∂) (commoner) households and shi (Â£´) (noble) households in the Nine ranks system which was created by Cao Wei and enabled hereditary officeholding by the aristocratic magnate families. Magnates took in farming families and war refugees into their fortress villages as ke (ÂÆ¢) (private clients) and as buqu (military retainers) who made up their private militias. These magnates were rich landowners and local warlords and their economic and social power only grew at this time. The military retainers stayed own as private agricultural laborers bonded to the magnate families even after war ended. They did not contribute any labor service or taxes to the central government while their magnate lord received 50% or more of their grain harvest. They effectively were bondservants to their lords.

==Culture==

The &quot;kaishu&quot; style of Chinese calligraphy was developed at some time between the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Cao Wei dynasty, as well as the Jian&#x27;an poetry style. The first known master of the former was Zhong Yao, an official of Wei, of the latter; Cao Cao&#x27;s son, Cao Zhi.

Since the beginning of the Cao Wei dynasty, finding their roots in Cao Cao&#x27;s administrative influences, intellectual constraints were relaxed, leading to the formation of new groups of intellectuals, such as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. These intellectual freedoms were overturned by the time of the Jin dynasty (it was Sima Yi himself who associated with the orthodox Confucianists, who despised these new intellectual groups, and therefore were more willing to offer their support to the Sima clan).

==Ruling class==
According to the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; by Wang Chen, the Cao family descended from the Yellow Emperor through his grandson Zhuanxu. They were of the same lineage as Emperor Shun. Another account says that the Cao family descended from Emperor Shun. This account was attacked by Jiang Ji, who claimed that those with the family name &quot;Tian&quot; descended from Shun, but not those surnamed &quot;Cao&quot;. He also claimed that &quot;Gui&quot; (Â™Ø) was Emperor Shun&#x27;s family name.

<text>Han (; 221‚Äì263), known in historiography as Shu Han ( ) or Ji Han ( &quot;Junior Han&quot;), or often shortened to Shu (; Sichuanese Pinyin: &quot;Su&quot; &lt; Middle Chinese: *&quot;≈∫jowk&quot; &lt; Eastern Han Chinese: *&quot;d≈∫ok&quot;), was a dynastic state of China and one of the three major states that competed for supremacy over China in the Three Kingdoms period. The state was based in the area around present-day Hanzhong, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Guizhou, and north Guangxi, an area historically referred to as &quot;Shu&quot; based on the name of the past ancient kingdom of Shu, which also occupied this approximate geographical area. Its core territory also coincided with Liu Bang&#x27;s Kingdom of Han, the precursor of the Han dynasty.

Shu Han&#x27;s founder, Liu Bei (Emperor Zhaolie), had named his dynasty &quot;Han&quot;, as he considered it a rump state of the Han dynasty and thus the legitimate successor to the Han throne, while the prefix &quot;Shu&quot; was first used by the rival state of Cao Wei to delegitimize the claims of the Shu Han state to orthodox succession. Later on when writing the Records of the Three Kingdoms, the historian, Chen Shou, also used the prefix &quot;Shu&quot; to describe Liu Bei&#x27;s state of Han as a historiographical prefix to differentiate it from the many other states officially named &quot;Han&quot; throughout Chinese history.

==History==
===Beginnings and founding===
Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Liu Bei, a warlord and distant relative of the Han imperial clan, rallied the support of many capable followers. Following the counsel of his advisor, Zhuge Liang, and Zhuge&#x27;s Longzhong Plan, Liu Bei conquered parts of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) in 208 and 209, took over Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from the warlord Liu Zhang between 212 and 214, and wrestled control of Hanzhong from his rival, Cao Cao, in 219. Afterwards, Liu Bei proclaimed himself King of Hanzhong.

From the territories he gained, Liu Bei established a position for himself in China during the final years of the Han dynasty. However, in 219, the alliance between Liu Bei and his ally, Sun Quan, was broken when Sun sent his general, L√º Meng, to invade Jing Province. Liu Bei lost his territories in Jing Province to Sun Quan. Guan Yu, the general guarding Liu Bei&#x27;s assets in Jing Province, was captured and subsequently executed by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces.

Cao Cao died in 220, and was succeeded by his son, Cao Pi, who forced the last Han ruler, Emperor Xian, to abdicate the throne in his favour. Cao Pi then established the state of Cao Wei, and declared himself emperor. Liu Bei contested Cao Pi&#x27;s claim to the throne, and proclaimed himself &quot;Emperor of Han&quot; in 221. Although Liu Bei is widely seen as the founder of Shu Han, he never claimed to be the founder of a new dynasty; rather, he viewed Shu Han as a continuation of the Han dynasty.

To distinguish the state from other historical Chinese states of the same name, historians have added a relevant character to the state&#x27;s original name: the state that called itself &quot;Han&quot; (Êº¢) is also known as &quot;Shu Han&quot; (ËúÄÊº¢) or just &quot;Shu&quot; (ËúÄ).

===Liu Bei&#x27;s reign===
Liu Bei ruled as emperor for less than three years. In 222, he launched a campaign against Sun Quan to retake Jing Province and avenge Guan Yu, culminating in the Battle of Xiaoting. However, due to grave tactical mistakes, Liu Bei suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Sun Quan&#x27;s general, Lu Xun, and lost the bulk of his army. He survived the battle and retreated to Baidicheng, where he died from illness a year later.

===Liu Shan&#x27;s reign===


Before Liu Bei&#x27;s death, he appointed the chancellor Zhuge Liang and the general Li Yan as regents to his son, Liu Shan. The young Liu Shan was only 16 years old, making him the youngest of the rulers of the Three Kingdom states, and Liu Bei expected the two regents to assist Liu Shan in managing state affairs. Zhuge Liang was the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the Shu government throughout Liu Shan&#x27;s reign, and was responsible for most of Shu&#x27;s policies during his regency.

When Liu Shan succeeded his father, Shu was the weakest of the three major powers. Following his father&#x27;s defeat in 221, the portion of Jing Province previously held by Shu was now firmly under the control of Wu. Shu only included the western lands of Yi Province, while Wei controlled all of the northern lands, and Wu controlled all the lands from the east of Yi Province to the southern and eastern coastlines. Meanwhile, Shu&#x27;s population was not large enough to stand against the rival state of Wei. This greatly limited Shu in terms of resources and manpower; although the country could efficiently defend itself, Shu could not easily launch successful campaigns. As such, Zhuge Liang parleyed for peace with Wu, and reaffirmed the alliance between Sun Quan and Shu ‚Äî with the former even recognising Sun Quan&#x27;s legitimacy when the latter broke with Wei, and declared himself &quot;Emperor of Wu&quot; in 229. In order to strengthen the Shu Han state&#x27;s authority in the remote southern region of Nanzhong, Zhuge Liang also launched an expeditionary force there in 225 to quell local rebellions, and the growing influence of the Nanman (literal: southern barbarians) in the region.

Zhuge Liang advocated an aggressive foreign policy towards Wei, because he strongly believed it was critical to the survival of Shu and its sovereignty. Between the years of 228 and 234, he launched a series of five military campaigns against Wei, with the aim of conquering Chang&#x27;an, a strategic city located on the road to the Wei capital, Luoyang. Most of the battles were fought around present-day Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. However, aside from gaining Jiang Wei as an officer in 228, Shu failed to achieve any significant victories or lasting gains in the five expeditions. During his final campaign where he fought against the Wei general, Sima Yi, an already taxed and ill Zhuge Liang died under the strain of the long stalemate with the Wei forces at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains.

After Zhuge Liang&#x27;s death, the Shu government was then headed by Jiang Wan, Fei Yi, and others, and Shu temporarily ceased its aggression towards Wei. In 244, the Wei regent, Cao Shuang, launched an invasion of Hanzhong. Despite being outnumbered 2-to-1, the Shu forces defeated the invading combatants at the Battle of Xingshi, with the humiliated Wei forces fleeing. Between 247 and 262, the Shu general, Jiang Wei, resumed Zhuge Liang&#x27;s legacy by leading a series of military campaigns against Wei, but also failed to make any significant territorial gains.

===Fall of Shu===
In 263, armies led by the Wei generals Deng Ai and Zhong Hui attacked Shu, and conquered its capital, Chengdu, without much struggle ‚Äî the state having been exhausted by Jiang Wei&#x27;s ill-fated campaigns. In the same year, Liu Shan surrendered to Deng Ai outside Chengdu, marking the end of Shu. In spite of this, Jiang Wei attempted to incite conflict between Deng Ai and Zhong Hui, in the hope of taking advantage of the situation to revive Shu. Zhong Hui captured Deng Ai, and openly rebelled against the Wei regent, Sima Zhao, but the revolt was suppressed by Wei forces. Jiang Wei, Zhong Hui, and Deng Ai were killed in the struggle.

Liu Shan was brought to Luoyang, where he met with Sima Zhao, and was awarded the title of &quot;Duke of Anle.&quot; He lived a comfortable and peaceful life in Luoyang until the end of his days.

==Economy==
Shu was not merely a nation at war. During peacetime, the Shu state began many irrigation and road-building projects designed to improve the economy. Many of these public works still exist and are widely used. For example, the Zipingpu Dam is still present near Chengdu, Sichuan. These works helped improve the economy of southwestern China, and can be seen as the beginning of economic activity in Sichuan. It also promoted trade with southern China, which was then ruled by Eastern Wu.

<text>Kotor (Cyrillic: –ö–æ—Ç–æ—Ä, ), historically known as Cattaro (from Italian: ), is a town in Coastal region of Montenegro. It is located in a secluded part of the Bay of Kotor. The city has a population of 13,347 and is the administrative center of Kotor Municipality.

The old Mediterranean port of Kotor is surrounded by fortifications built during the Venetian period. It is located on the Bay of Kotor (&quot;Boka Kotorska&quot;), one of the most indented parts of the Adriatic Sea. Some have called it the southernmost fjord in Europe, but it is a ria, a submerged river canyon. Together with the nearly overhanging limestone cliffs of Orjen and Lovƒáen, Kotor and its surrounding area form an impressive landscape.

Since the early 2000s Kotor has seen an increase in tourists, many of them coming by cruise ship. Visitors are attracted to the natural environment of the Bay of Kotor and the old town of Kotor. Kotor is part of the World Heritage Site dubbed the Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor.

The fortified city of Kotor was also included in UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Site list as part of Venetian Works of Defence between 16th and 17th centuries: &quot;Stato da Terra&quot; ‚Äì western &quot;Stato da Mar&quot; in 2017.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Once populated by the Illyrians, the exact time of foundation of the first settlement is not known. According to some sources, the oldest settled area dates two millennia back.

The city, first mentioned in 168¬†BC, was settled during ancient Roman times, when it was known as Acruvium, Ascrivium, or Ascruvium () and was part of the Roman province of Dalmatia.

=== Middle Ages ===
The city has been fortified since the early Middle Ages, when Emperor Justinian built a fortress above Ascrivium in 535, after expelling the Ostrogoths. Ascrivium was plundered by the Saracens in 840. It was further fortified towards the peak of Saint Ivan by Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos in the 10th century.
It was one of the more influential Dalmatian city-states, initially with a Romance-speaking population, as throughout the early Middle Ages, and until the 11th century the Dalmatian language was still spoken in Kotor. The city was part of Byzantine Dalmatia in that period, and the modern name of Kotor probably originated in the Byzantine name for the city: &quot;Dekatera&quot; or &quot;Dekaderon&quot;.

In 1002, the city suffered damage under the occupation of the First Bulgarian Empire, and in the following year it was ceded to Duklja by the Bulgarian Tsar Samuil. Duklja, or Dioclea, was a vassal duchy of Byzantium at the time. The local population resisted the pact and, taking advantage of its alliance with Dubrovnik, maintained its high autonomy. Duklja, the biggest Serb duchy at the time, gradually became more powerful under Vojislavljeviƒá dynasty and eventually independent from Byzantium in 1042. The city remained autonomous up until Duklja was once again subdued by Byzantium in 1143.

The city was conquered in 1185 by Stefan Nemanja, the ruler of the Grand Principality of Serbia and founder of the Nemanjiƒá dynasty. At that time Kotor was already an episcopal see subordinated to the archbishopric of Bari, and in 13th century, Dominican and Franciscan monasteries were established to check the spread of Bogomilism. Under the rule of the Nemanjiƒá Kotor became a partially autonomous city, enjoying many privileges and maintaining its republican institutions. This is backed by a statute from 1301, which demonstrates that Kotor had the status of a city under Serbian rule. In the 14th century the commerce of &quot;Cattaro&quot;, as named in Latin scripts (in Serbian &quot;–ö–æ—Ç–æ—Ä, –≥—Ä–∞–¥ –∫—Ä–∞—ô–µ–≤/Kotor, city of the King&quot;), rivaled that of Republic of Ragusa, and caused the Republic of Venice to be envious. Kotor remained the most important trading port of subsequent Serb states ‚Äì Kingdom of Serbia and Serbian Empire, up to its downfall in 1371.

After the fracturing of the Serbian Empire, the city was taken by the Kingdom of Hungary, only to change hands repeatedly between them and the Republic of Venice in the period between 1371 and 1384. After that, Kotor was held by the Kingdom of Bosnia under Tvrtko I Kotromaniƒá between 1384 and 1391. The king of Bosnia, who claimed the Serbian throne, minted his coins in Kotor.

After the death of Tvrtko in 1391, Kotor became fully independent, until the administration, wary of the looming Ottoman danger, asked Venice for protection. The city acknowledged the suzerainty of Venice in 1420.

A document from 1332 mentions that the town had a Catholic Latin population, while outside the town walls lived Albanians.

===Venetian rule===

The city was part of the Venetian Albania province of the Venetian Republic from 1420 to 1797.

Four centuries of Venetian domination have given the city the typical Venetian architecture, that contributes to make Kotor a UNESCO world heritage site.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, there was an influx of settlers from the oblasts of Trebinje (the region around forts Klobuk Ledenica and Rudina) and the &quot;Hum lands&quot; (Gacko and Dabar) to Kotor. The Italian name of the city is &quot;Cattaro&quot;. Under Venetian rule, Kotor was besieged by the Ottoman Empire in 1538 and 1657, endured the plague in 1572, and was nearly destroyed by earthquakes in 1563 and 1667. 

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the customs of the local administration of Kotor, such as the right of the &quot;popolari&quot; to elect urban representatives, were unchanged and tolerated by the Provveditore of the city, despite Venetian laws prohibiting such institutions. In 1627, during a dispute between the populari and Kotor&#x27;s nobility, this right was revoked by the &quot;consultare&quot; Fulgenzio Micanzio, thus empowering the position of the city&#x27;s urban elite.

===Habsburg and Napoleonic rule===

After the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, it passed to the Habsburg monarchy. However, in 1805, it was assigned to the French Empire&#x27;s client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy, by the Treaty of Pressburg, although in fact held by a Russian squadron under Dmitry Senyavin. After the Russians retreated, Kotor was united in 1806 with this Kingdom of Italy and then in 1810 with the French Empire&#x27;s Illyrian Provinces. Kotor was captured by the British in an attack on the Bay led by Commodore John Harper in the brig sloop (18 guns). To seal off Kotor, residents along the shore literally pulled the ship in windless conditions with ropes. &quot;Saracen&quot;&#x27;s crew later hauled naval 18-pounder guns above Fort St. John, the fortress near Kotor, and were reinforced by Captain William Hoste with his ship (38 guns). The French garrison had no alternative but to surrender, which it did on 5 January 1814.

It was restored to the Habsburgs by the Congress of Vienna. Until 1918, the town, then known as &quot;Cattaro&quot;, was head of the district of the same name, one of the 13 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in the Kingdom of Dalmatia.

===World War I===

During World War I, &quot;Cattaro&quot; was one of three main bases of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, the home port of the Austrian Fifth Fleet, consisting of pre-dreadnought battleships and light cruisers, and a base for Austrian and German submarines. The Cattaro mutiny of sailors of the Austro-Hungarian Navy occurred in Kotor starting on 1 February 1918. The mutiny remained isolated and had to be abandoned after three days due to the arrival of loyal troops. Four sailors were subsequently executed according to naval law.

The area was the site of some of the fiercest battles between local Montenegrins and Austria-Hungary. The city came under the allied occupation of the eastern Adriatic in 1918. After 1918, the city became a part of Yugoslavia and officially became known as &quot;Kotor&quot;.

===World War II===
Between 1941 and 1943 the Kingdom of Italy annexed the area of Kotor which became one of three provinces of the Italian Governorate of Dalmatia ‚Äì the Province of Cattaro had an area (subdivided in 15 &quot;Comuni&quot;) of 547¬†km2 and a population of 39,800 inhabitants. Most of the city&#x27;s inhabitants were Orthodox (with some Roman Catholics). After the war the remaining Dalmatian Italians of Kotor (300 inhabitants) left Yugoslavia towards Italy (Istrian-Dalmatian exodus).

==Main sights==

Kotor has one of the best preserved medieval old towns in the Adriatic and is a double Unesco World Heritage Site: it is part of Natural and Culturo-Historical Region of Kotor and Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra ‚Äì western Stato da Mar.

It is home to numerous sights, such as the Cathedral of Saint Tryphon in the old town (built in 1166), and the ancient walls which stretch for directly above the city. Sveti ƒêorƒëe and Gospa od ≈†krpijela islets off the coast of Perast are also among the tourism destinations in the vicinity of Kotor.

==Culture==
Kotor hosts several summer events, such as the &quot;Summer Carnival&quot; or &quot;Bokeljska Noƒá&quot;. Together with Budva, and the small town of Tuzi, near Podgorica, the city hosted the Federation of European Carnival Cities (FECC) World Carnival City Congress in May 2009.

Kotor Festival of Theatre for Children is one of the most important festivals of its kind in Southeast Europe. Thirty years of this manifestation have marked performances by artists from over 30 countries, from 5 continents. It was founded in 1993, not far from the place where the first play for children in the Balkans was performed in 1829. The 2017/18 festival was awarded the EFFE Label by the EFA (European Festivals Association). Kotor Festival is highly regarded in the local community and has a large volunteer base.

Kotor has a large population of cats that have become a symbol of the city. The city has several cat stores and a cat museum, as well as the Cats&#x27; Square (&quot;Trg od maƒçaka&quot;). Water and food is left throughout the city for the cats to feed on, and cardboard boxes are often arranged to be a place for the cats to sleep in. Tourists may notice cats in poor health, which may be due to malnutrition, lack of shelter, fighting, or illness (often a common viral respiratory condition for which medicine is unavailable). The charity Kotor Kitties exists to try and help the cats of Kotor through spaying and neutering. 
Kotor is described evocatively at the beginning of Marguerite Yourcenar&#x27;s story &#x27;Marko&#x27;s Smile.&#x27;

==Demographics==
Kotor is the administrative centre of Kotor municipality, which includes the towns of Risan and Perast, as well as many small hamlets around the Bay of Kotor, and has a population of 21,916.

The town of Kotor itself has 1,360 inhabitants, but the administrative limits of the town encompass only the area of the Old Town. The urban area of Kotor also includes Dobrota (7,345) and ≈†kaljari (3,342), bringing the population of Kotor&#x27;s urban area close to 13,000 inhabitants. The total number rises to around 15,000 if the neighbouring hamlets of Muo, Prƒçanj and Stoliv are included. The entire population of Kotor Municipality was 21,916, as of the 2023 census.

Ethnic composition of the municipality in 2011:
Historically, there was a significant community of Italians in Kotor, the Dalmatian Italians. Until the 19th century the main language of Kotor was Italian. During the 19th century, the use of Italian began to decline in favour of Serbian. According to the Austrian censuses they were 623 Dalmatian Italians (18.7% of the total population) in 1890, 338 (11.2%) in 1900 and 257 (8%) in 1910. The majority of the Italian minority left the city for Italy after the Treaty of Rapallo (1920). Their number dropped drastically following the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus, which took place from 1943 to 1960. From the 2011 Montenegrin census, there are 31 Dalmatian Italians present in Kotor, corresponding to 0.14% of the total population.

According to documents from 1900, Kotor had 7,617 Catholics, and 7,207 Orthodox Christians. Kotor is still the seat of the Catholic Bishopric of Kotor, which covers the entire gulf. In 2011, 78% citizens of Kotor were Orthodox Christians, while 12% were listed as Roman Catholic.

<text>Cetinje (, ) is a town in Montenegro. It is the former royal capital () of Montenegro and is the location of several national institutions, including the official residence of the president of Montenegro.

According to the 2023 census, the town had a population of 12,460 while the Cetinje Municipality had 14,465 residents. Cetinje is the centre of Cetinje Municipality. The city rests on a small karst plain surrounded by limestone mountains, including Mount Lovƒáen, the legendary mountain in Montenegrin historiography. Cetinje was founded in the 15th century and became a cradle of the culture of Montenegro. Its status as the honorary capital of Montenegro is due to its heritage as a long-serving former capital of Montenegro.

==Name==
In Montenegrin, Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian, it is known as &quot;Cetinje&quot; (archaically –¶–µ—Ç–∏–Ω—£ / &quot;Cetinƒõ&quot;); in Italian as &quot;Cettigne&quot;; in Greek as ŒöŒµœÑŒØŒ≥ŒΩŒ∑ (&quot;Ket√≠gni&quot;); in Turkish as &quot;√áetince (means toughly)&quot;; and in Albanian as &quot;Cetina&quot;.

According to the written data, by the end of the 17th century, down the plain flowed the River Cetina, so that part of the town was called by that river Cetinjsko polje (The field of Cetinje). In Cetinjsko polje, at that time there used to be a small inhabited village, by which the later newly created town got name Cetinje. In the historical documents, Cetinje is mentioned for the first time in 1440.

== History ==
===Founding===

Cetinje was founded in 1482, when Ivan Crnojeviƒá moved his capital from Obod above the Crnojeviƒá River to deeper into the hills to a more easily defended location in a field at the foot of Mount Lovƒáen. He had his court built at the new location that year and also founded a monastery (dedicated to the Mother of Christ) as a personal endowment in 1484. His court and the monastery are the first recorded renaissance buildings in Montenegro. Crnojeviƒá was forced to move the seat of the Eparchy of Zeta from Vranjina to Cetinje due to the Ottoman invasions, in 1485. The town was named after the Cetina river.

The bishopric of Zeta was elevated to a metropolitanate in Cetinje. It was later to play an important part in both the religious and national life. The Crnojeviƒá printing house, the first printing house in southeastern Europe, was active between 1493 and 1496 in Cetinje. Zeta was first put under Ottoman rule in 1499, then annexed by the Ottomans in 1514, organized into the Sanjak of Montenegro.

===Early modern period===
In the next two centuries, the development of Cetinje stagnated. It was very often subject to attack by Venice and the Ottomans. The city therefore endured many privations in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.

During this period the court and the monastery of the Crnojeviƒái dynasty were destroyed. It was only at the end of the 17th century, in 1697, that Cetinje began to flourish again under the rule of the Petroviƒá dynasty, refounded by Danilo Petroviƒá.

===Modern period===

Leading the wars of liberation and strengthening the unity in the country occupied Danilo and his successors, so they were unable to devote enough effort to the further development of Cetinje. It was only during the rule of Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈° that far greater progress was made. In 1838 his new royal residence called Biljarda (Billiard house) was built. Cetinje was enlarged by building new houses that gradually led to genuine urbanization.

Many modern buildings designed for foreign consulates were built due to the newly established relations with various European countries, including the French, Russian, British, Italian and Austro-Hungarian consulates.

Cetinje made great progress under the rule of Prince Nikola I Petroviƒá when numerous public edifices were built. Those include the first hotel, called &#x27;Lokanda&#x27;, then the new Prince&#x27;s palace, the Girls&#x27; Institute and the hospital. This period also saw the first tenancy houses. In the 1860 census Cetinje had 34 households. After initially holding off Ottoman incursions in 1852 and 1853, Cetinje was captured by Ottoman Omar Pasha&#x27;s forces during the Montenegrin‚ÄìOttoman War of 1861‚Äì62. Ottoman rule over Montenegro did not last much more than a decade however, as 14 years later the &quot;Great War&quot;, the third successive contest between the two nations, ended in Montenegrin victory, with most previously-Montenegrin territory returning to their control.

Montenegrin independence was recognized at the Congress of Berlin of 1878 and consequently Cetinje became the capital of a European country. Between 1878 and 1914 Cetinje flourished in every sense. Many renowned intellectuals from other South-Slavic parts came to stay there and made a contribution to the cultural, educational and every other aspect of life. Montenegro was proclaimed a kingdom in 1910. This had a great effect on Cetinje&#x27;s development. At this time the Government House, the symbol of state power, was built. The population census from the same year recorded a massive growth in the world&#x27;s smallest capital, registering 5,895 inhabitants.

In the Interwar period, Cetinje expanded its territory, as it was now a centre of the Zeta region. But when it was decided by the Parliament of Montenegro that the administrative organs should be located in Titograd (previously and presently Podgorica), Cetinje went through a harsh crisis. By building certain industrial sections and at the same time neglecting the development of the city&#x27;s traditional and potential cultural and tourist capacities, the chance to create a strong basis for more solid prosperity was lost.

When Communist forces captured Cetinje in November 1944 the only population that stayed in the town were people who believed they have no reason to fear or hide from anybody. Still, as soon as Communists captured Cetinje, in the night of 13 November 1944, they shot without any trial 28 citizens of Cetinje. They were all summarily executed at &quot;New Cemetery&quot; of Cetinje in Humci.

On 12 August 2022, a mass shooting occurred in Cetinje, in which eleven people died, including the perpetrator, and six others were injured.

On 1 January 2025, another mass spree shooting occurred in Cetinje, in which fourteen people, including the perpetrator, were killed and three others were injured. The two mass shootings that have occurred in the same town are the deadliest in Montenegro&#x27;s history.

All these institutions keep, process, and provide public access to enormous literary treasure, and protect both mobile and immobile cultural monuments throughout Montenegro. The oldest ‚Äì and for a long time the most important ‚Äì cultural institution in the town is the monastery of Cetinje.

=== Architecture and urban heritage ===
The onset and development of Cetinje, as a relatively young city, with its old historical core draws a lot of attention to urban and architectural heritage, on its construction and development influenced stormy historical, social and economic events in the country.

Cetinje as a settlement has existed for 500 years, which is a relatively short period of time compared to the development of the coastal agglomeration of the ancient period in the immediate surroundings. However, these five centuries comprise the whole history of a people, who, through the development of city recorded moments of their origin, ascent, stagnation and downs.

Cetinje as an urban agglomeration can be said to have formed suddenly, which makes it very specific. In fact, since the 1870s, for almost fifty years, there was, in the urban context, designed and typological characteristic areas formed with urban-type residential home ground floors and multi-storey houses with developed attics, created and developed in closed urban blocks, in a street ‚Äì house ‚Äì garden layout.

Along with the development of this type of urban city blocks and residential buildings, the city has developed substantial public architecture, which was built under the influence of foreign builders with the application of various architectural styles, and which then and now is a representative architectural backbone of the city.

Between the two world wars, characterized by the loss of Montenegrin statehood and noticeable stagnation of the architectural development of the city, Cetinje continues the tradition of formed, then already traditional type of urban residential houses and closed urban blocks, but they built the first modern multi-storey residential buildings for collective housing, and modern public institutions necessary for the then social life.

In the fastest and most important period of the development of Cetinje, since the 1870s until the First World War, which was then the smallest European old capital, was created and developed city on the principles the European metropolises of that time in whose architectural activity of the city was engaged many foreign architects, engineers, builders and craftsmen.

The development of Cetinje in this period was followed by many important historical and social events. So the second half of the nineteenth century in the development of Cetinje marked a period of state power and its pursuit of European culture and international recognition. The recognition of Montenegro as an independent state, at the Berlin Congress in 1878, on the basis of which it greatly expanded, began a period of rapid creation of a national, economic, social, cultural, societal and spatial superstructure which caused an increase of economic power and the reorganization and improvement of the state apparatus and the authorities. During this period, Cetinje, as the old royal capital, gained even greater national and international significance and experienced rapid socio‚Äìeconomic, institutional, and urban development.

Without taking into consideration the possibilities and efforts which Cetinje was realized as a relatively small and young city, it occupies an important place in terms of conceptual, social and urban transformation of other cities in Montenegro, particularly since the second half of the nineteenth century until the First World War. Based on that and the facts about today&#x27;s relatively well-preserved urban heritage, Cetinje has been recognised for its significant architectural heritage.

=== Printing houses in Cetinje ===
Cetinje has a rich publishing and printing tradition. The Printing House of Crnojeviƒái (1492‚Äì1496) and the books published there are of great importance for Montenegrin culture and history as well as for the culture of other Orthodox Balkan peoples. Its greatest contribution refers to spreading Cyrillic type. Thus, it represents an important link in a chain of world culture. There were a number of printing houses that continued this great printing tradition. These are: Njego≈° Printing House, which operated between 1833 and 1839 and the State Printing House which was founded in 1858. It was renamed in 1952. Since then it has been known as &quot;Obod&quot;.

Since their foundation to the present day, Cetinje printing houses have published over 3,000 books, a major contribution to the Montenegrin cultural heritage. The first Montenegrin literary and scientific annual, &quot;Grlica&quot; (Turtledove), was published in 1835, while the first Montenegrin newspaper, &#x27;The Montenegrin&#x27;, was established in 1871. Since then, sixty different newspapers and over thirty magazines have been published. In 1914, as a town of fewer than 6,000 inhabitants, Cetinje supported six different daily newspapers.

=== Libraries ===
The oldest libraries of Montenegro, where the oldest books and documentation of great value are preserved, are located at Cetinje. This makes Cetinje internationally recognized as well. The oldest library among these is the Library of Cetinje Monastery, which was founded by the end of the 15th century at the time when the Printing House of Crnojeviƒái started operating. Today, seventy-five old manuscripts written in Cyrillic, then four incunabula, and many old liturgical books are kept there.

The first public reading room in Montenegro known as The Reading Room of Cetinje was founded in 1896. Since its founding it has been the cultural centre of Montenegro. The fruitful activity of this reading room was continued by the Town Library and the Njego≈° reading room, which offers over 63,000 books and volumes of periodicals.

The school libraries of Cetinje also have a long tradition. The library of the oldest school at Cetinje today known as Njego≈° Elementary School dates back to 1834, the library of the clerical college and the Carica Marija Girls&#x27; Institute dates back to 1869, and the library of the Gymnasium to 1880.

<text>Traditional Chinese opera (), or Xiqu, is a form of musical theatre in China with roots going back to the early periods in China. It is an amalgamation of various art forms that existed in ancient China, and evolved gradually over more than a thousand years, reaching its mature form in the 13th century, during the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279 AD). Early forms of Chinese theater are simple; however, over time, various art forms such as music, song and dance, martial arts, acrobatics, costume and make-up art, as well as literary art forms were incorporated to form traditional Chinese opera. Performers had to practice for many years to gain an understanding of the roles. Exaggerated features and colors made it easier for the audience to identify the roles portrayed by the performers.

There are over a hundred regional branches of traditional Chinese opera today. In the 20th century, the Peking opera emerged in popularity and has come to known as the &quot;national theatre&quot; of China, but other genres like Yue opera, Cantonese opera, Yu opera, &quot;kunqu&quot;, &quot;qinqiang&quot;, Huangmei opera, &quot;pingju&quot;, and Sichuan opera are also performed regularly before dedicated fans. Their differences are mainly found in the music and topolect; the stories are often shared and borrowed. With few exceptions (such as revolutionary operas and to some extent Shanghai operas) the vast majority of Chinese operas (including Taiwanese operas) are set in China before the 17th century, whether they are traditional or newly written.

For centuries, Chinese opera was the main form of entertainment for both urban and rural residents in China as well as the Chinese diaspora. Its popularity declined sharply in the second half of the 20th century as a result of both political and market factors. Language policies discouraging topolects in Taiwan and Singapore, official hostility against rural religious festivals in China, and de-Sinicization in Taiwan have all been blamed for the decline of various forms in different times, but overall the two major culprits were Cultural Revolution ‚Äî which saw traditional culture systematically erased, innumerable theatre professionals viciously persecuted, and younger generation raised with far lesser exposure to Chinese opera ‚Äì and modernization, with its immense social impact and imported values that Chinese opera has largely failed to counter. The total number of regional genres was determined to be more than 350 in 1957, but in the 21st century the Chinese government could only identify 162 forms for its intangible cultural heritage list, with many of them in immediate danger of disappearing. For young people, Chinese opera is no longer part of the everyday popular music culture, but it remains an attraction for many older people who find in it, among other things, a national or regional identity.

==History==

===Six dynasties to Tang===
An early form of Chinese drama is the &quot;Canjun Opera&quot; (ÂèÉËªçÊà≤, or Adjutant Play) which originated from the Later Zhao Dynasty (319‚Äì351 AD). In its early form, it was a simple comic drama involving only two performers, where a corrupt officer, &quot;Canjun&quot; or the adjutant, was ridiculed by a jester named Grey Hawk (ËíºÈ∂ª). The characters in &quot;Canjun Opera&quot; are thought to be the forerunners of the fixed role categories of later Chinese opera, particularly of its comic chou (‰∏ë) characters.

Various song and dance dramas developed during the Six Dynasties period. During the Northern Qi Dynasty, a masked dance called the Big Face (Â§ßÈù¢, which can mean &quot;mask&quot;, alternatively &quot;daimian&quot; ‰ª£Èù¢, and it was also called The King of Lanling, Ëò≠ÈôµÁéã), was created in honour of Gao Changgong who went into battle wearing a mask. Another was called &quot;Botou&quot; (Êí•È†≠, also ÁºΩÈ†≠), a masked dance drama from the Western Regions that tells the story of a grieving son who sought a tiger that killed his father. In The Dancing Singing Woman (Ë∏èË¨°Â®ò), which relates the story of a wife battered by her drunken husband, the song and dance drama was initially performed by a man dressed as a woman. The stories told of in these song-and-dance dramas are simple, but they are thought to be the earliest pieces of musical theatre in China, and the precursors to the more sophisticated later forms of Chinese opera.

These forms of early drama were popular in the Tang dynasty where they further developed. For example, by the end of the Tang Dynasty the &quot;Canjun Opera&quot; had evolved into a performance with more complex plot and dramatic twists, and it involved at least four performers. The early form of Chinese theatre became more organized in the Tang dynasty with Emperor Xuanzong (712‚Äì755), who founded the &quot;Pear Garden&quot; (Ê¢®Âõ≠/Ê¢®Âúí; l√≠yu√°n), the first academy of music to train musicians, dancers and actors. The performers formed what may be considered the first known opera troupe in China, and they performed mostly for the emperors&#x27; personal pleasure. To this day operatic professionals are still referred to as &quot;Disciples of the Pear Garden&quot; (Ê¢®Âõ≠ÂºüÂ≠ê / Ê¢®ÂúíÂºüÂ≠ê, l√≠yu√°n d√¨zi).

===Song to Qing===
By the Song Dynasty, &quot;Canjun Opera&quot; had become a performance that involved singing and dancing, and led to the development of &quot;Zaju&quot; (ÈõúÂäá). Forms such as the &quot;Zaju&quot; and &quot;Nanxi&quot; (ÂçóÊàè) further matured in the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) and Yuan dynasty (1279‚Äì1368). Acts based on rhyming schemes and innovations such as specialized roles like &quot;Dan&quot; (Êó¶, d√†n, female), &quot;Sheng&quot; (Áîü, shƒìng, male), &quot;Hua&quot; (Ëä±, huƒÅ, painted-face) and &quot;Chou&quot; (‰∏ë, ch≈èu, clown) were introduced into the opera. Although actors in theatrical performances of the Song Dynasty strictly adhered to speaking in Classical Chinese onstage, during the Yuan Dynasty actors speaking or performing lyrics in the vernacular tongue became popular on stage.

In the Yuan poetic drama, only one person sang for all of the four acts, but in the poetic dramas that developed from &quot;Nanxi&quot; during the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), all the characters were able to sing and perform. Playwright Gao Ming late in the Yuan dynasty wrote an opera called &quot;Tale of the Pipa&quot; which became highly popular, and became a model for Ming dynasty drama as it was the favorite opera of the first Ming emperor Zhu Yuanzhang. The presentation at this point resembled the Chinese opera of today, except that the librettos were then very long. The operatic artists were required to be skilled in many fields; according to &quot;Recollections of Tao An&quot; (Èô∂Â∫µÂ§¢ÊÜ∂) by Zhang Dai, performers had to learn how to play various musical instruments, singing and dancing before they were taught acting.

The dominant form of the Ming and early Qing dynasties was Kunqu, which originated in the Wu cultural area. A famous work in Kunqu is &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot; by Tang Xianzu. Kunqu later evolved into a longer form of play called &quot;chuanqi&quot;, which became one of the five melodies that made up Sichuan opera. Currently Chinese operas continue to exist in 368 different forms, the best known being Beijing opera, which assumed its present form in the mid-19th century and was extremely popular in the latter part of the Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911).


In Beijing opera, traditional Chinese string and percussion instruments provide a strong rhythmic accompaniment to the acting. The acting is based on allusion: gestures, footwork, and other body movements express such actions as riding a horse, rowing a boat, or opening a door. Spoken dialogue is divided into recitative and Beijing colloquial speech, the former employed by serious characters and the latter by young females and clowns. Character roles are strictly defined, and each character have their own elaborate make-up design. The traditional repertoire of Beijing opera includes more than 1,000 works, mostly taken from historical novels about political and military struggles.

===1912‚Äì1949===
At the turn of the 20th century, Chinese students returning from abroad began to experiment with Western plays. Following the May Fourth Movement of 1919, a number of Western plays were staged in China, and Chinese playwrights began to imitate this form. The most notable of the new-style playwrights was Cao Yu (b. 1910). His major works‚Äî&quot;Thunderstorm&quot;, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Wilderness&quot;, and &quot;Peking Man&quot;‚Äîwritten between 1934 and 1940, have been widely read in China.

The Republican Era saw the rise of Yue opera and all female Yue Opera troupes in Shanghai and Zhejiang. A woman-centric form, with all female casts and majority female audience members, plots were often love stories. Its rise was related to the changing place of women in society.¬† ¬†

In the 1930s, theatrical productions performed by traveling Red Army cultural troupes in Communist-controlled areas were consciously used to promote party goals and political philosophy. By the 1940s, theater was well established in the Communist-controlled areas.

===1949‚Äì1985===

In the early years of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, development of Peking opera was encouraged; many new operas on historical and modern themes were written, and earlier operas continued to be performed. As a popular art form, opera has usually been the first of the arts to reflect changes in Chinese policy. In the mid-1950s, for example, it was the first to benefit under the Hundred Flowers Campaign, such as the birth of Jilin opera.

In 1954 there were approximately 2000 government-sponsored opera troupes working throughout China each consisting of 50‚Äì100 professional performers. Despite its popularity, Peking opera made up a small percentage of these troupes. After the Chinese Communist Revolution a new genre emerged known as &quot;Schinggo&quot; opera which encompassed the revolutionary energy of the current sociopolitical climate. This operatic style built its foundation from the folk traditions of the rural community while also becoming influenced by European music.

Opera may be used as commentaries on political affairs, and in November 1965, the attack on Beijing deputy mayor Wu Han and his historical play &quot;Hai Rui Dismissed from Office&quot; as anti-Mao, signaled the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, most opera troupes were disbanded, performers and scriptwriters were persecuted, and all operas were banned except the eight &quot;model operas&quot; that had been sanctioned by Jiang Qing and her associates. Western-style plays were condemned as &quot;dead drama&quot; and &quot;poisonous weeds&quot;, and were not performed. After the fall of the Gang of Four in 1976, Beijing Opera enjoyed a revival and continued to be a very popular form of entertainment, both on stage and television.

===Present===
In the 21st century, Chinese opera is seldom publicly staged except in formal Chinese opera houses. It may also be presented during the lunar seventh month Chinese Ghost Festival in Asia as a form of entertainment to the spirits and audience. More than thirty famous pieces of Kunqu opera continue to be performed today, including &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot;, &quot;The Peach Blossom Fan&quot;, and adaptions of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

In 2001, Kunqu was recognized as Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (UNESCO)

== Costume and make-up ==

Face paint plays a significant role in portraying the internal complexities of the performer&#x27;s character with hundreds of combinations of colours and patterns. Below are some general meanings which may be further focused on extremely specific details depending on the facial location of the colour.

* Red ‚Äì bravery, fidelity, loyalty, chastity
* Black ‚Äì impatience, straightforwardness, vulgarity, rudeness
* White ‚Äì cunning, treachery, villainy, betrayal
* Blue ‚Äì ferocity, courage, uncontrollability, cruelty, violence
* Yellow ‚Äì cleverness, secretiveness, mystery, evil
* Purple ‚Äì loyalty, filial piety, age
* Green ‚Äì bravery, purpose, an evil spirit
* Gold and silver ‚Äì godhood, divinity, the supernatural (monsters, spirits, demons) 

==Musical characteristics==
The musical components of Chinese opera are created as an inseparable entity from voice and dance/movement. Both the musicians and the actors contribute to composing musical accompaniment. This collaborative process is reflected within the production by the immaculate synchronicity between the actors&#x27; movements and the sounds of the orchestra. The musicians are required to flawlessly support the actors with sound, often waiting for vocal cues or physical signals such as the stomp of a foot. Traditionally, musicians often performed from memory ‚Äì a feat made even more impressive considering pieces or sections of compositions were subject to infinite variations and often repeated.

The orchestra utilized a pentatonic scale until a 7-note scale was introduced by Mongolia during the Yuan Dynasty. The two extra notes functioned similarly to accidentals within western notation.

=== Instruments ===
The instruments in the orchestra were divided into two categories:

* &quot;wen&quot; ‚Äì string and wind instruments: characterized as clear, soft, or gentle and typically used during vocal pieces.
* &quot;wu&quot; ‚Äì percussive instruments: led dancing and movement, kettle drum &quot;conducts&quot; the whole orchestra, gongs signal audience to sit, appearance of female lead, anger, and fighting.

====String====

*Gaohu
*Erhu
*Pipa
*Sanxian

==Regional genres==

==In popular culture==
The Peking opera subgenre is the focal point of the 1988 play &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;, in which a spy for the Chinese government disguises himself as a woman performer under the alias Song Liling and enters a 20-year relationship with French civil servant Ren√© Gallimard. The latter is unaware that female roles in Peking opera are actually played by men due to women being barred from the stage.

An update in January 2022 for the game &quot;Genshin Impact&quot; includes a story quest that features a musical number from the character Yun Jin that is in the style of Chinese opera &quot;The Divine Damsel of Devastation&quot;, which went viral as it was the first time many people around the world have heard Chinese opera. Even Yang Yang, the Chinese voice of Yun Jin, was surprised about it.

In the 2022 film &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;, one of Evelyn&#x27;s multiverse counterparts became a prodigious Chinese opera singer after being blinded in a childhood accident. Evelyn assimilates this version&#x27;s abilities to improve her self-confidence and breath control during a fight. Later in the film, the interaction between various multiverse versions of Evelyn result in the Chinese opera version botching and then salvaging a performance.

<text>The National Research Council Canada (NRC; ) is the primary national agency of the Government of Canada dedicated to science and technology research and development. It is the largest federal research and development organization in Canada.

The Minister of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development (currently, Fran√ßois-Philippe Champagne) is responsible for the NRC.

== Mandate ==
NRC is an agency of the Government of Canada, and its mandate is set out in the &quot;National Research Council Act&quot;.

Under the Act, the NRC is responsible for:
* Undertaking, assisting or promoting scientific and industrial research in fields of importance to Canada;
* Providing vital scientific and technological services to the research and industrial communities;
* Investigating standards and methods of measurement;
* Working on the standardization and certification of scientific and technical apparatus, instruments and materials used or usable by Canadian industry;
* Operating and administering any astronomical observatories established or maintained by the Government of Canada;
* Establishing, operating and maintaining a national science library; and
* Publishing and selling or otherwise distributing such scientific and technical information as the Council deems necessary.
Over 5,000 people across Canada are employed by the NRC. In addition, the NRC also employs guest workers from universities, companies, and public and private-sector organizations.

== History ==
=== Between World War I and II ===
The National Research Council was established in 1916, under the pressure of World War I, to advise the government on matters of science and industrial research. In 1932, laboratories were built on Sussex Drive in Ottawa and the Medical Research Committee was formed with Dr. Frederick Banting as the inaugural Chair.

With the impetus of World War II, the NRC grew rapidly and for all practical purposes, became a military science and weapons research organization. It undertook a number of important projects, which included participation with the United States and United Kingdom, in the development of chemical and germ warfare agents, the explosive RDX, the proximity fuse, radar, and submarine detection techniques. Many inventions and innvoations during this period and beyond drew upon the skills of engineer George J. Klein, who is often touted as the most productive inventor in Canada during the 20th century. A special branch, known as the Examination Unit, was involved with cryptology and the interception of enemy radio communications. According to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service website, the NRC headquarters in Ottawa &quot;was a prime espionage target&quot; during the Cold War. The NRC was also engaged in atomic fission research at the Montreal Laboratory, and later the Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario.

=== Post-World War II ===
Post-WWII, the NRC reverted to its pre-war civilian role, and a number of wartime activities were spun off to newly formed organizations. Military research continued under a new organization, the Defence Research Board, while inventions with commercial potential were transferred to the newly formed Canadian Patents and Development Limited; and atomic research went to the newly created Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. Foreign signals intelligence gathering officially remained with the agency when, by Order in Council, the Examination Unit became the Communications Branch of the NRC in 1946. The CBNRC was transferred to the Department of National Defence in 1975, and renamed the Communications Security Establishment. During the 1950s, the medical research funding activities of the NRC were handed over to the newly formed Medical Research Council of Canada. 

By 1960, the Medical Research Committee had separated from the National Research Council, forming the Medical Research Council of Canada (which dissolved upon the creation of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research [ and the initial withdrawal from the National Reserve in 1997 (see Budget Implementation Act 1997), which was invested for three years and became life, along with CIHR in 2000 (see CIHR Act).

On 1 May 1978, with the rapid post-war growth of Canadian universities, the NRC&#x27;s role in university research funding in the natural sciences was passed under the GOSA Act to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Under financial pressure in the 1980s, the federal government produced what popularly became known as the Neilson Report, which recommended across-the-board financial cuts to all federal government organizations, including the NRC. This led to staff and program cutbacks. By 1985, however, two entities emerged from the National Research Council: the Social Science and Humanities Research Council (see SSHRC Act) and the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (See NSERC Act). The emergence of these Councils, for all material reasons, took over funding from the Federal Government and is responsible for relaying that to Academic Institutions, Academic hospitals and Research Institutions under the Agreement on the Administration of Agency Grants and Awards by Research Institutions, administered by a Secretariat (on the Responsible Conduct of Research).

=== 21st century ===
In 2000, there were about 1000 NRC researchers with PhDs conducting research in many areas.

Recovery was slow, but the NRC has managed to regain its status as Canada&#x27;s single most important scientific and engineering research institution among many other Canadian government scientific research organizations.

As President of the National Research Council Canada, chemist Arthur Carty revitalized the organization. In 2004, he left the NRC when then prime minister Paul Martin appointed him as independent, non-partisan advisor on science and technology.

In April 2010 Mr. John McDougal of Edmonton, Alberta was appointed President of the NRC by the Stephen Harper Government

Around June 2014, the NRC was reportedly penetrated by Chinese state-sponsored hackers.

The tenure of John McDougall as President of the NRC (2010‚Äì2016) was marked by a number of controversies. His presidency was characterized by a dramatic drop in publications and patents, by significant cuts in scientific staff, and by a 23-month period during which NRC management was aware that the organization was contaminating the water table outside its fire-safety testing facility in Mississippi Mills, Ontario, with perfluorinated chemicals used in firefighting foams and did not inform that community&#x27;s inhabitants. John McDougall&#x27;s departure ‚Äì signalled by a sudden, three-line email to employees in March 2016 announced that he was going on personal leave. During this time Maria Aubrey, Vice President of the NRC, filled the role as Acting President. Effective August 24, 2016, Iain Stewart became the new President of the NRC. The details regarding McDougall&#x27;s personal leave were not publicly disclosed.

Under Minister of Science Kirsty Duncan, the Trudeau government changed the focus of the NRC, to develop partnerships with private and public-sector technology companies, both nationally and internationally. Under the previous federal Minister of State (Science and Technology), Gary Goodyear, the NRC became in the words of one wag a &quot;toolbox for industry&quot; and dented basic-research infrastructure.

In August 2020 under Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Navdeep Bains and President Iain Stewart, the NRC announced it was building the Biologics Manufacturing Centre, a facility that can produce vaccines and other biologics. The construction of the facility was started as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Canada&#x27;s inability to produce COVID-19 Vaccines. The facility is expected to open in July 2021, and will have a vaccine manufacturing capacity of 2 million does per month. In February 2021, the Canadian government has signed a memorandum of understanding with Novavax to pursue manufacturing its NVX-CoV2373 vaccine at the Biologics Manufacturing Centre.

In September 2020, President Iain Stewart was shuffled to the troubled Public Health Agency of Canada, and in December 2020 Bains named Mitch Davies to fill the vacancy.

In October 2021, Iain Stewart returned to his position as President of the National Research Council.

In January 2024, Mitch Davies was appointed as President of the National Research Council following the retirement of Iain Stewart.

=== Algal Carbon Conversion Flagship Program ===
The goal of the Algal Carbon Conversion Pilot Program was to develop of an algae system to recycle carbon emissions from the oil sands. It contained plans for a $19-million facility to be constructed in Alberta, in partnership between the NRC, Canadian Natural Resources, and Pond Biofuels.

In 2008, researchers from five I-CAN organizations were developing a Carbon Algae Recycling System (CARS) to &quot;feed waste heat and flue gas containing from industrial exhaust stacks to micro-algae growing in artificial ponds.&quot; The &quot;Algal Carbon Conversion&quot;, is related to prior interests of NRC President John McDougall, as he previously headed Innoventures, a company involved in lobbying for the development of an algae system to recycle carbon emissions.

The NRC was not involved in this area of research prior to the arrival of McDougall.

=== Canadian Wheat Improvement Flagship ===
The Canadian Wheat Improvement Program is a &quot;strategic collaboration with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), the University of Saskatchewan‚Äôs Crop Development Centre and the province of Saskatchewan.&quot; With a budget of approximately $97 million (2013‚Äì2018), the Canadian Wheat Alliance will be conducting research on improving the yield of Canadian wheat crops and on the most efficient use of chemical fertilizers. Working with breeders and scientists at the Crop Development Centre and at AAFC, they will be integrating long-term research with genetic improvement of wheat.

=== Gallium Nitride Electronics Program ===
Gallium nitride (GaN) is a semiconductor commonly used in light-emitting diodes. The GaN Electronics Program supports partner research and development activities with a goal of ensuring that GaN technology will create wealth and a greener future for Canadians. The NRC is the only Canadian foundry for GaN electronics, and offers both normally-on and normally-off devices. The GaN500v2 Foundry Design Kit was released on June 28, 2014.

=== Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP) ===
The NRC Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP) was introduced in the 1950s to support product developments in small to medium-sized businesses. The NRC provides grants and financial support to business&#x27; looking to bring new and innovative technologies to the market.

Some of the many innovations by NRC personnel included the artificial pacemaker, development of canola (rapeseed) in the 1940s, the Crash Position Indicator in the 1950s, and the Cesium Beam atomic clock in the 1960s.

Since 1974, Paul Barton of PSB Speakers used the NRC&#x27;s world-class measurement facilities, their anechoic chamber. By the 1980s, more companies began to use this resource, develop it further, and tested their loudspeakers at the NRC. Electrical engineer, Floyd E. Toole, who worked at the NRC was at the centre of this research. By the year 2000, most companies had their own sound chambers, but Barton continued to use the NRC&#x27;s facilities. In about 1990, PSB and other Canadian companies worked with the NRC on Athena to evaluate digital signal processing (DSP) for loudspeaker design.

From 2002 to 2006, John R. McDougall, who was appointed President of the NRC in 2010, was a member of the NRC-IRAP Advisory Board. In 2011, Bev Oda, the Minister of International Cooperation, and Gary Goodyear, Minister of State (Science and Technology), announced the grant recipients. These included small to medium-sized businesses, such as, Nortek Solutions a privately owned Canadian software company. They received a $30,000 grant from the NRC to hire a young graphics design graduate to work on their &quot;CUROS&quot; people management software. Oasys Healthcare, a company that provides &quot;innovative audio and video solutions for the medical marketplace&quot; received a $13,000 NRC grant for its new technology for operating rooms. Jeffrey Ross Jewellery&#x27;s product called Dimples, imprints fingerprints in silver using an innovative process and material, developed through a NRC $35,750 grant.

== Controversies ==
=== Harper government ===
Under the tenure of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Canadian Government research organizations began to restrict the ability of government scientists to communicate with the public. This includes restricting scientists within the NRC to communicate with the public through non-scientist communications personnel. Harper&#x27;s focus as an economist was on his action plan: creating jobs and building the economy. There were widespread concerns that the progress in development was at the cost of the environment.

In 2012, the federal government moved &quot;to defund government research centres in the High Arctic.&quot; In the same year National Research Council environmental scientists &quot;were barred from discussing their work on snowfall with the media.

The appointment by Harper&#x27;s Minister of State (Science and Technology) Gary Goodyear of John McDougall as President of the NRC was followed by several controversies:

In 2011, President John McDougall began to oversee a change in research focus away from basic research and towards industry-relevant research. This included the development of multiple programs which shifted the research budget out of existing projects and into a number of focused programs. In October 2012, John McDougall and his appointment, Dr. Ian Potter (VP Business Management), served termination notices to all of the NRC&#x27;s Business Development Officer&#x27;s (BDOs) across Canada, which ultimately impacted the majority of the NRC&#x27;s intellectual property management, patenting, and business development activities conducted at the various NRC&#x27;s research centres in Canada.

The transformation of the NRC into a research and technology organization that focuses on &quot;business-led research&quot; was part of the Harper government&#x27;s Economic Action Plan. On 7 May 2013, the NRC launched its new &quot;business approach&quot; in which it offered four business lines: strategic research and development, technical services, management of science and technology infrastructure and NRC-Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP). With these services, the NRC intended to shorten the gap between early stage research and development and commercialization.

During his tenure as president, there was a drop in research publications and new patents from the NRC as the scientific staff was cut significantly. An article published in April 2016 and based on information from the office of the Minister of Science gave the following figures for the period 2011‚Äì2015: In the five years from 2011 through 2015, the number of studies in academic journals were 1,889, 1,650, 1,204, 1,017 and 549, respectively. (Figures from 2010 and earlier are generally in the 1,200 to 1,300 range.) The number of patents over the period 2011 to 2014 (with no figure available for 2015) are: 205, 251, 128 and 112, respectively. The years before 2011 averaged 250 to 300 patents per year. 

In 2014 the NRC&#x27;s computer network was the target of a cyber attack by Chinese infiltrators, which resulted in the NRC&#x27;s IT network being shut down for an extended period of time.

In September 2016, the office of the Minister of Science released figures showing that from 2010 to 2015, the number of research officers at the NRC fell by 26 per cent, and the number of scientists and engineers of all kinds fell by 22 per cent.

McDougall&#x27;s tenure as president included the period during which the NRC contaminated the water table in the Eastern Ontario community of Mississippi Mills, without informing its inhabitants. In January 2014, NRC employees at the fire-safety testing facility in Mississippi Mills were told to start drinking bottled water. In December 2015, 23 months later, residents of Mississippi Mills with homes near the facility were warned by the NRC that their well-water was contaminated with toxic chemicals called perfluorinated alkyl substances, often found in firefighting foam. In July 2016, Acting President Maria Aubrey formally acknowledged that the NRC&#x27;s National Fire Laboratory was the source of the groundwater contamination in Mississippi Mills. In December 2016, it was reported that owners of homes near the lab in Mississippi Mills were launching a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the NRC over water contamination.

In March 2016, John McDougall sent a three-sentence email to NRC employees, announcing that he was going on personal leave. Subsequently, NRC management announced that two major projects he had led would be abandoned: re-branding the NRC as &quot;CNRCSolutions&quot; ‚Äì though colourful &quot;CNRCSolutions&quot; T-shirts and &quot;branding books&quot; had already been distributed, and re-organizing its three research divisions into five research divisions.

Effective August 24, 2016 under Kirsty Duncan, Iain Stewart became the new President of the NRC. The details regarding McDougall&#x27;s personal leave were not publicly disclosed.

=== Bill C-38 ===
Bill C-38 angered many people who opposed unregulated industrial growth. They argued that science was being gutted and silenced to open the way for development in ecologically sensitive areas in the north.

In June 2012, the federal opposition made a motion in parliament,
===Thirty Meter Telescope===
Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is a proposed extremely large telescope (ELT) that has become controversial due to its planned location on Mauna Kea, which is considered sacred land according to the native Hawaiians, on the island of Hawaii in the United States. On April 6, 2015, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Canada would commit $243.5 million over a period of 10 years. The telescope&#x27;s enclosure was designed by Dynamic Structures Ltd. in British Columbia.

In an online petition, a group of Canadian academics have called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, together with Navdeep Bains (then Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development) and Kirsty Duncan (then Minister Of Science) to divest Canadian funding from the project. On July 20, 2019, an online petition titled &quot;A Call to Divest Canada&#x27;s Research Funding for the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea&quot; has been posted on Change.org.

<text>Heimrad Prem (27 May 1934 ‚Äì 19 February 1978) was a German painter born in Roding, Oberpfalz. From 1949 to 1952 he studied decorative painting at Schwandorf and then studied painting with Josef Oberberger and sculpture with Toni Stadler at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste, Munich until 1956. While studying painting with Ernst Schumacher at the Hochschule der K√ºnste, Berlin, he formed Gruppe SPUR with Lothar Fischer, Helmut Sturm, and Hans-Peter Zimmer. After meeting Asger Jorn, SPUR joined the Situationist International.

In 1960 he won a scholarship of the Kulturpreises im Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie, Cologne. From 1960 to 1962 he co-edited the magazine &quot;SPUR&quot;. In 1961 he visited Orkelljunga, Sweden with Sturm, Zimmer and Dieter Kunzelmann staying with J√∏rgen Nash. In 1962 the SPUR group was expelled from the Situationist International, but they continued to work with Nash and others. In 1963 he worked on the SPUR collaborative works: &quot;Canale Grande Crescente&quot; for the exhibition &quot;Visione e Colore&quot; in the Palazzo Grassi, Venice, the SPUR-Bau joint contribution to the exhibition &quot;Nouveaux Espaces&quot;, Biennale Paris, and the &quot;SPUR room&quot; in the country house of Willi Bleicher with Munich.

His first solo exhibition in the Galerie van de Loo, Munich was also in 1963. In 1965 the group SPUR fused with &quot;Wir&quot; to form the group &quot;Geflecht&quot; (Network). After a short stay in South Sweden, Prem organised the organization of &quot;white celebration&quot; near Munich and began to paint under the influence of drugs.

After his first suicide attempt in 1971 he traveled in Italy, Turkey and Iran. In 1975 he became a joint founder of the artists&#x27; community &quot;Kollektiv Herzogstrasse&quot;. He became a lecturer at the winter academy in the Schloss Ki√ülegg. In 1976 he had a special exhibition at the Haus der Kunst, Munich. The following year he exhibited in Copenhagen.

Following this, he continued to exhibit work mainly in Germany.

Heimrad Prem committed suicide in 1978 in Munich.

<text>32VSB is an acronym for 32-level vestigial sideband modulation, capable of transmitting five bits (25=32) at a time.

32VSB is rarely used, because receivers have more trouble distinguishing between so many fine levels of modulation. It can, however, be useful in situations such as short last mile coaxial cable runs, which bring fiber to the curb systems into the home as regular cable TV, cable modem, and cable telephone services.

Other slower but more rugged forms include 2VSB, 4VSB, 8VSB, and 16VSB.

<doc id="277584" wikidata="Q919348" url="?curid=277584" title="Chinese painting">
<text>Chinese painting () is one of the oldest continuous artistic traditions in the world. Painting in the traditional style is known today in Chinese as &quot;gu√≥ hu√†&quot; (), meaning &quot;national painting&quot; or &quot;native painting&quot;, as opposed to Western styles of art which became popular in China in the 20th century. It is also called &quot;danqing&quot; (). Traditional painting involves essentially the same techniques as calligraphy and is done with a brush dipped in black ink or coloured pigments; oils are not used. As with calligraphy, the most popular materials on which paintings are made are paper and silk. The finished work can be mounted on scrolls, such as hanging scrolls or handscrolls. Traditional painting can also be done on album sheets, walls, lacquerware, folding screens, and other media.

The two main techniques in Chinese painting are:
* Gongbi (Â∑•Á≠Ü), meaning &quot;meticulous&quot;, uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimit details very precisely. It is often highly colored and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects. It is often practiced by artists working for the royal court or in independent workshops.
* Ink and wash painting, in Chinese &quot;shu«ê-m√≤&quot; (Ê∞¥Â¢®, &quot;water and ink&quot;) also loosely termed watercolor or brush painting, and also known as &quot;literati painting&quot;, as it was one of the &quot;four arts&quot; of the Chinese Scholar-official class. In theory this was an art practiced by gentlemen, a distinction that begins to be made in writings on art from the Song dynasty, though in fact the careers of leading exponents could benefit considerably. This style is also referred to as &quot;xieyi&quot; (ÂØ´ÊÑè) or freehand style.

Landscape painting was regarded as the highest form of Chinese painting, and generally still is. The time from the Five Dynasties period to the Northern Song period (907‚Äì1127) is known as the &quot;Great age of Chinese landscape&quot;. In the north, artists such as Jing Hao, Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, and Guo Xi painted pictures of towering mountains, using strong black lines, ink wash, and sharp, dotted brushstrokes to suggest rough stone. In the south, Dong Yuan, Juran, and other artists painted the rolling hills and rivers of their native countryside in peaceful scenes done with softer, rubbed brushwork. These two kinds of scenes and techniques became the classical styles of Chinese landscape painting.

==Specifics and study==
Chinese painting and calligraphy distinguish themselves from other cultures&#x27; arts by emphasis on motion and change with dynamic life. The practice is traditionally first learned by rote, in which the master shows the &quot;right way&quot; to draw items. The apprentice must copy these items strictly and continuously until the movements become instinctive. In contemporary times, debate emerged on the limits of this copyist tradition within modern art scenes where innovation is the rule. Changing lifestyles, tools, and colors are also influencing new waves of masters.

==Early periods==
The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. It was only during the Eastern Zhou (770‚Äì256 BC) that artists began to represent the world around them. In imperial times (beginning with the Eastern Jin dynasty), painting and calligraphy in China were among the most highly appreciated arts in the court and they were often practiced by amateurs‚Äîaristocrats and scholar-officials‚Äîwho had the leisure time necessary to perfect the technique and sensibility necessary for great brushwork. Calligraphy and painting were thought to be the purest forms of art. The implements were the brush pen made of animal hair, and black inks made from pine soot and animal glue. In ancient times, writing, as well as painting, was done on silk. However, after the invention of paper in the 1st century AD, silk was gradually replaced by the new and cheaper material. Original writings by famous calligraphers have been greatly valued throughout China&#x27;s history and are mounted on scrolls and hung on walls in the same way that paintings are.

Artists from the Han (206 BC ‚Äì 220 AD) to the Tang (618‚Äì906) dynasties mainly painted the human figure. Much of what we know of early Chinese figure painting comes from burial sites, where paintings were preserved on silk banners, lacquered objects, and tomb walls. Many early tomb paintings were meant to protect the dead or help their souls to get to paradise. Others illustrated the teachings of the Chinese philosopher Confucius or showed scenes of daily life.

During the Six Dynasties period (220‚Äì589), people began to appreciate painting for its own beauty and to write about art. From this time we begin to learn about individual artists, such as Gu Kaizhi. Even when these artists illustrated Confucian moral themes ‚Äì such as the proper behavior of a wife to her husband or of children to their parents ‚Äì they tried to make the figures graceful.




===Six principles===


The &quot;Six principles of Chinese painting&quot; were established by Xie He, a writer, art historian and critic in 5th century China, in &quot;Six points to consider when judging a painting&quot; (Áπ™Áï´ÂÖ≠Ê≥ï, Pinyin: Hu√¨hu√† Li√πf«é), taken from the preface to his book &quot;The Record of the Classification of Old Painters&quot; (Âè§Áï´ÂìÅÈåÑ; Pinyin: G«îhu√† P«ênl√π). Keep in mind that this was written circa 550 CE and refers to &quot;old&quot; and &quot;ancient&quot; practices. The six elements that define a painting are:

# &quot;Spirit Resonance&quot;, or vitality, which refers to the flow of energy that encompasses theme, work, and artist. Xie He said that without Spirit Resonance, there was no need to look further.
# &quot;Bone Method&quot;, or the way of using the brush, refers not only to texture and brush stroke, but to the close link between handwriting and personality. In his day, the art of calligraphy was inseparable from painting.
# &quot;Correspondence to the Object&quot;, or the depicting of form, which would include shape and line.
# &quot;Suitability to Type&quot;, or the application of color, including layers, value, and tone.
# &quot;Division and Planning&quot;, or placing and arrangement, corresponding to composition, space, and depth.
# &quot;Transmission by Copying&quot;, or the copying of models, not from life only but also from the works of antiquity.

==Sui, Tang and Five dynasties (581‚Äì979)==


During the Tang dynasty, figure painting flourished at the royal court. Artists such as Zhou Fang depicted the splendor of court life in paintings of emperors, palace ladies, and imperial horses. Figure painting reached the height of elegant realism in the art of the court of Southern Tang (937‚Äì975).

Most of the Tang artists outlined figures with fine black lines and used brilliant color and elaborate detail. However, one Tang artist, the master Wu Daozi, used only black ink and freely painted brushstrokes to create ink paintings that were so exciting that crowds gathered to watch him work. From his time on, ink paintings were no longer thought to be preliminary sketches or outlines to be filled in with color. Instead, they were valued as finished works of art.

Beginning in the Tang dynasty, many paintings were landscapes, often &quot;shanshui&quot; (Â±±Ê∞¥, &quot;mountain water&quot;) paintings. In these landscapes, monochromatic and sparse (a style that is collectively called &quot;shuimohua&quot;), the purpose was not to reproduce the appearance of nature exactly (realism) but rather to grasp an emotion or atmosphere, as if catching the &quot;rhythm&quot; of nature.

A considerable amount of literary and documentary information about Tang painting has survived, but very few works, especially of the highest quality. A walled-up cave in the Mogao Caves complex at Dunhuang was discovered by Sir Aurel Stein, which contained a vast haul, mostly of Buddhist writings, but also some banners and paintings, making much the largest group of paintings on silk to survive. These are now in the British Museum and elsewhere. They are not of court quality, but show a variety of styles, including those with influences from further west. As with sculpture, other survivals showing Tang style are in Japan, though the most important, at Nara, was very largely destroyed in a fire in 1949.
The rock-cut cave complexes and royal tombs also contain many wall-paintings. Court painting mostly survives in what are certainly or arguably copies from much later.



==Song, Liao, Jin and Yuan dynasties (907‚Äì1368)==


Painting during the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) reached a further development of landscape painting; immeasurable distances were conveyed through the use of blurred outlines, mountain contours disappearing into the mist, and impressionistic treatment of natural phenomena. The &quot;shan shui&quot; style painting‚Äî&quot;shan&quot; meaning mountain, and &quot;shui&quot; meaning river‚Äîbecame prominent in Chinese landscape art. The emphasis laid upon landscape was grounded in Chinese philosophy; Taoism stressed that humans were but tiny specks in the vast and greater cosmos, while Neo-Confucianist writers often pursued the discovery of patterns and principles that they believed caused all social and natural phenomena. The painting of portraits and closely viewed objects like birds on branches were held in high esteem, but landscape painting was paramount. By the beginning of the Song dynasty a distinctive landscape style had emerged. Artists mastered the formula of intricate and realistic scenes placed in the foreground, while the background retained qualities of vast and infinite space. Distant mountain peaks rise out of high clouds and mist, while streaming rivers run from afar into the foreground.

There was a significant difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period (960‚Äì1127) and Southern Song period (1127‚Äì1279). The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of society; their paintings often depicted huge, sweeping landscapes. During the Northern Song, landscape paintings had political significance and were used by the court to emphasize its strength and authority with the symbolism of grand landscapes. The Northern Song court commissioned enormous landscapes which it used in support of its rites.

Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale, a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success; their paintings often focused on smaller, visually closer, and more intimate scenes, while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without concern for the artist or viewer. This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo-Confucian philosophy. Adherents to Neo-Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up, not the top down, which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state-controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era.

Ever since the Southern and Northern dynasties (420‚Äì589), painting had become an art of high sophistication that was associated with the gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes, the others being calligraphy and poetry. During the Song dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings, as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends. The poet and statesman Su Shi (1037‚Äì1101) and his accomplice Mi Fu (1051‚Äì1107) often partook in these affairs, borrowing art pieces to study and copy, or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed. They created a new kind of art based upon the three perfections in which they used their skills in calligraphy (the art of beautiful writing) to make ink paintings. From their time onward, many painters strove to freely express their feelings and to capture the inner spirit of their subject instead of describing its outward appearance. The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and mood of the painting.

Although they were avid art collectors, some Song scholars did not readily appreciate artworks commissioned by those painters found at shops or common marketplaces, and some of the scholars even criticized artists from renowned schools and academies. Anthony J. Barbieri-Low, a professor of early Chinese history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, points out that Song scholars&#x27; appreciation of art created by their peers was not extended to those who made a living simply as professional artists:

During the Northern Song (960‚Äì1126 CE), a new class of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l&#x27;≈ìil skills of the academy painters nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati&#x27;s painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They were not to be considered real artists.

However, during the Song period, there were many acclaimed court painters and they were highly esteemed by emperors and the royal family. One of the greatest landscape painters given patronage by the Song court was Zhang Zeduan (1085‚Äì1145), who painted the original &quot;Along the River During the Qingming Festival&quot; scroll, one of the most well-known masterpieces of Chinese visual art. Emperor Gaozong of Song (1127‚Äì1162) once commissioned an art project of numerous paintings for the &quot;Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute&quot;, based on the woman poet Cai Wenji (177‚Äì250 AD) of the earlier Han dynasty. Yi Yuanji achieved a high degree of realism painting animals, in particular monkeys and gibbons. During the Southern Song period (1127‚Äì1279), court painters such as Ma Yuan and Xia Gui used strong black brushstrokes to sketch trees and rocks and pale washes to suggest misty space.



During the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368), painters joined the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy by inscribing poems on their paintings. These three arts worked together to express the artist&#x27;s feelings more completely than one art could do alone. Yuan emperor Tugh Temur (r. 1328, 1329‚Äì1332) was fond of Chinese painting and became a creditable painter himself.



&#x27;

==Late imperial China (1368‚Äì1895)==

Beginning in the 13th century, the tradition of painting simple subjects‚Äîa branch with fruit, a few flowers, or one or two horses‚Äîdeveloped. Narrative painting, with a wider color range and a much busier composition than Song paintings, was immensely popular during the Ming period (1368‚Äì1644).

The first books illustrated with colored woodcuts appeared around this time; as color-printing techniques were perfected, illustrated manuals on the art of painting began to be published. &quot;Jieziyuan Huazhuan (Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden)&quot;, a five-volume work first published in 1679, has been in use as a technical textbook for artists and students ever since.

Some painters of the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) continued the traditions of the Yuan scholar-painters. This group of painters, known as the Wu School, was led by the artist Shen Zhou. Another group of painters, known as the Zhe School, revived and transformed the styles of the Song court.

During the early Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911), painters known as Individualists rebelled against many of the traditional rules of painting and found ways to express themselves more directly through free brushwork. In the 18th and 19th centuries, great commercial cities such as Yangzhou and Shanghai became art centers where wealthy merchant-patrons encouraged artists to produce bold new works. However, similar to the phenomenon of key lineages producing, many well-known artists came from established artistic families. Such families were concentrated in the Jiangnan region and produced painters such as Ma Quan, Jiang Tingxi, and Yun Zhu. 
It was also during this period when Chinese trade painters emerged. Taking advantage of British and other European traders in popular port cities such as Canton, these artists created works in the Western style particularly for Western traders. Known as Chinese export paintings, the trade thrived throughout the Qing dynasty.

In the late 19th and 20th centuries, Chinese painters were increasingly exposed to Western art. Some artists who studied in Europe rejected Chinese painting; others tried to combine the best of both traditions. Among the most beloved modern painters was Qi Baishi, who began life as a poor peasant and became a great master. His best-known works depict flowers and small animals.

==Modern painting==
Beginning with the New Culture Movement, Chinese artists started to adopt using Western techniques. Prominent Chinese artists who studied Western painting include Li Tiefu, Yan Wenliang, Xu Beihong, Lin Fengmian, Fang Ganmin and Liu Haisu.

=== Early PRC ===
After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Communist Party&#x27;s Propaganda Department organized networks of cultural workers&#x27; associations which were headed by the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The state incorporated existing cultural enterprises into the state apparatus, which provided stable income and working environments for artists.

In the early years of the PRC, artists were encouraged to employ socialist realism. Some Soviet Union socialist realism was imported without modification, and painters were assigned subjects and expected to mass-produce paintings. Following the model of the Soviet Union, the early PRC endorsed historical oil painting and the state commissioned many artistic works in this style to represent the new nation by depicting major battles and other events leading the country&#x27;s proclamation. In this period, critics took a negative stance towards the &quot;guohua&quot; painting style.

This regimen was considerably relaxed in 1953, and after the Hundred Flowers Campaign of 1956‚Äì57, traditional Chinese painting experienced a significant revival. By the mid-1950s, relations between China and the Soviet Union were deteriorating, and Mao Zedong was increasingly eager for China to establish its own national path. Propaganda campaigns began to promote the re-adoption of traditional art styles as suitable for depicting modern social relations. The New &quot;Guohua&quot; Campaign asked painters to modernize the traditional style (which had historically been exclusive to China&#x27;s ruling class) to portray the PRC&#x27;s landscape. The traditional landscape form and techniques were largely retained, but new elements like the increased use of the color red and the incorporation of modern vehicles and cable lines were intended to convey socialist modernity.

Along with these developments in professional art circles, there was a proliferation of peasant art depicting everyday life in the rural areas on wall murals and in open-air painting exhibitions. During the Great Leap Forward, authorities promoted the Peasant Painting Movement, from which hundreds of thousands of new artists emerged. As part of this Movement, peasant artists decorated village walls with Great Leap Forward-themed murals. The Great Leap Forward also prompted a second wave of the New &quot;Guohua&quot; Campaign in which the state commissioned landscape artists to paint new production projects; select paintings of the campaign were taught in schools, published widely as propaganda posters, exhibited in museums, and used as the backdrops of state events.

During the Cultural Revolution, art schools were closed, and publication of art journals and major art exhibitions ceased. Major destruction was also carried out as part of the elimination of Four Olds campaign. During the Cultural Revolution, the spread of peasant paintings in rural China became one of the newborn things celebrated in a socialist society.

===Since 1978===
Following the Cultural Revolution, art schools and professional organizations were reinstated. Exchanges were set up with groups of foreign artists, and Chinese artists began to experiment with new subjects and techniques.
One particular case of freehand style (xieyi hua) may be noted in the work of the child prodigy Wang Yani (born 1975) who started painting at age 3 and has since considerably contributed to the exercise of the style in contemporary artwork.

After Chinese economic reform, more and more artists boldly conducted innovations in Chinese painting. The innovations include: development of new brushing skill such as vertical direction splash water and ink, with representative artist Tiancheng Xie, creation of new style by integration traditional Chinese and Western painting techniques such as Heaven Style painting, with representative artist Shaoqiang Chen, and new styles that express contemporary theme and typical nature scene of certain regions such as Lijiang Painting Style, with representative artist Gesheng Huang. A 2008 set of paintings by Cai Jin, most well known for her use of psychedelic colors, showed influences of both Western and traditional Chinese sources, though the paintings were organic abstractions.

===Contemporary Chinese art===
Chinese painting continues to play an essential role in Chinese cultural expression. Starting in the mid-twentieth century, artists begin to combine traditional Chinese painting techniques with Western art styles, leading to the style of new contemporary Chinese art. One of the representative artists is Wei Dong who drew inspirations from eastern and western sources to express national pride and arrive at personal actualization. Another key figure is Liu Dan, known for his ink painting.

== Iconography in Chinese painting ==

=== Water Mill ===
As the landscape painting rose and became the dominant style in North Song dynasty, artists began to shift their attention from jiehua painting, which indicates paintings of Chinese architectural objects such as buildings, boats, wheels and vehicles, towards landscape paintings. Intertwining with the imperial landscape painting, water mill, an element of jiehua painting, though, is still used as an imperial symbol. Water mill depicted in the &quot;Water Mill&quot; is a representation for the revolution of technology, economy, science, mechanical engineering and transportation in Song dynasty. It represents the government directly participate in the milling industry which can influence commercial activities. Another evidence that shows the government interfered with the commercial is a wineshop that appears beside the water mill. The water mill in &quot;Shanghai Scroll&quot; reflects the development in engineering and growing knowledge in hydrology. Furthermore, a water mill can also be used to identify a painting and used as a literature metaphor. Lately, the water mill transform into a symbolic form representing the imperial court.

&quot;A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains&quot; by Wang Ximeng, celebrates the imperial patronage and builds up a bridge that ties the later emperors, Huizong, Shenzong with their ancestors, Taizu and Taizong. The water mill in this painting, unlike that is painted in previous Shanghai scroll to be solid and weighted, it is painted to be ambiguous and vague to match up with the court taste of that time. The painting reflects a slow pace and peaceful idyllic style of living. Located deeply in a village, the water mill is driven by the force of a huge, vertical waterwheel which is powered by a sluice gate. The artist seems to be ignorance towards hydraulic engineering since he only roughly drew out the mechanism of the whole process. &quot;A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains&quot;painted by Wang Ximeng, a court artist taught directly by Huizong himself. Thus, the artwork &quot;A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains&quot;should directly review the taste of the imperial taste of the landscape painting. Combining richness bright blue and turquoise pigments heritage from Tang dynasty with the vastness and solemn space and mountains from Northern Song, the scroll is a perfect representation of imperial power and aesthetic taste of the aristocrats.

=== Image as Word: Rebus ===
There is a long tradition of having hidden meaning behind certain objects in Chinese paintings. A fan painting by an unknown artist from North Song period depicts three gibbons capturing baby egrets and scaring the parents away. The rebus behind this scene is interpreted as celebrating the examination success. Since another painting which has similar subjects‚Äîgibbons and egrets, is given the title of San yuan de lu‰∏âÁåøÂæóÈπ≠, or Three gibbons catching egrets. As the rebus, the sound of the title can also be written as ‰∏âÂÖÉÂæóË∑Ø, meaning &quot;a triple first gains [one] power.&quot; ÂÖÉrepresents &quot;first&quot; replaces its homophonous Áåø, and Ë∑Ømeans road, replaces Èπ≠. Sanyuan is firstly recorded as a term referring to people getting triple first place in an exam in Qingsuo gaoyi by a Liu Fu, and the usage of this new term gradually spread across the country where the scenery of gibbons and egrets is widely accepted. Lately, other scenery derived from the original paintings, including deer in the scene because in Chinese, deer, lu is also a homophonous of egrets. Moreover, the number of gibbons depicted in the painting can be flexible, not only limited to three, sanyuan. Since the positions in Song courts are held by elites who achieved jinshi degree, the paintings with gibbons, egrets or deer are used for praising those elites in general.

Emperor Huizong personally painted a painting called &quot;Birds in a blossom wax-plum tree&quot;, features with two &quot;hoary headed birds,&quot; &quot;Baitou weng&quot; resting on a tree branch together. &quot;Baitou&quot; in Chinese culture is allusion to faithful love and marriage. In a well-known love poem, it wrote: &quot;I wish for a lover in whose heart I alone exist, unseparated even our heads turn hoary.&quot; During Huizong&#x27;s rule, literati rebus is embedded in court painting academy and became part of the test routine to enter the imperial court. During Song dynasty, the connection between painters and literati, paintings and poem is closer.

=== The Donkey Rider ===
&quot;The country is broken; mountains and rivers remain.&quot; The poem by Du Fu (712‚Äì770) reflects the major principle in Chinese culture: the dynasty might change, but the landscape is eternal. This timelessness theme evolved from Six Dynasties period and early Northern Song. A donkey rider travelling through the mountains, rivers and villages is studied as an important iconographical character in developing of landscape painting.

The donkey rider in the painting &quot;Travelers in a wintry forest&quot; by Li Cheng is assumed to be a portrait painting of Meng Haoran, &quot;a tall and lanky man dressed in a scholar plain robe, riding on a small horse followed by a young servant.&quot; Except Meng Haoran, other famous people for example, Ruan Ji, one of the seven sages of the Bamboo Grove and Du Fu, a younger contemporary of Meng are also depicted as donkey rider. Tang dynasty poets Jia Dao and Li He and early Song dynasty elites Pan Lang, Wang Anshi appears on the paintings as donkey rider. North Song poets Lin Bu and Su Shi are lately depicted as donkey rider. In this specific painting &quot;Travelers in a wintry forest&quot;, the potential candidates for the donkey rider are dismissed and the character can only be Meng Haoran. Meng Haoran has made more than two hundred poems in his life but none of them is related with donkey ride. Depicting him as a donkey rider is a historical invention and Meng represents a general persona than an individual character. Ruan Ji was depicted as donkey rider since he decided to escape the office life and went back to the wilderness. The donkey he was riding is representing his poverty and eccentricity. Du Fu was portrayed as the rider to emphasis his failure in office achievement and also his poor living condition. Meng Haoran, similar to those two figures, disinterested in office career and acted as a pure scholar in the field of poem by writing real poems with real experience and real emotional attachment with the landscape. The donkey rider is said to travel through time and space. The audience are able to connect with the scholars and poets in the past by walking on the same route as those superior ancestors have gone on. Besides the donkey rider, there is always a bridge for the donkey to across. The bridge is interpreted to have symbolic meaning that represents the road which hermits depart from capital city and their official careers and go back to the natural world.

=== Realm of the Immortals ===
During Song dynasty, paintings with themes ranging from animals, flower, landscape and classical stories, are used as ornaments in imperial palace, government office and elites&#x27; residence for multiple purposes. The theme of the art in display is carefully picked to reflect not only a personal taste, but also his social status and political achievement. In emperor Zhezong&#x27;s lecture hall, a painting depicting stories form Zhou dynasty was hanging on the wall to remind Zhezong how to be a good ruler of the empire. The painting also serves the purpose of expressing his determination to his court officers that he is an enlightened emperor.

The main walls of the government office, also called walls of the &quot;Jade Hall,&quot; meaning the residence of the immortals in Taoism are decorated by decorative murals. Most educated and respected scholars were selected and given the title xueshi. They were divided into groups in helping the Instituted of Literature and were described as descending from the immortals. Xueshi are receiving high social status and doing carefree jobs. Lately, the xueshi yuan, the place where xueshi lives, became the permanent government institution that helped the emperor to make imperial decrees.

During Tang dynasty reign of Emperor Xianzong (805‚Äì820), the west wall of the xueshi yuan was covered by murals depicting dragon-like mountain scene. In 820‚Äì822, immortal animals like Mount Ao, flying cranes, and , a kind of immortal birds were added to the murals. Those immortal symbols all indicate that the xueshi yuan as eternal existing government office.

During Song dynasty, the xueshi yuan was modified and moved with the dynasty to the new capital Hangzhou in 1127. The mural painted by Song artist Dong yu, closely followed the tradition of the Tang dynasty in depicting the misty sea surrounding the immortal mountains. The scenery on the walls of the Jade Hall which full of mist clouds and mysterious land is closely related to Taoism tradition. When Yan Su, a painter followed the style of Li Cheng, was invited to paint the screen behind the seat of the emperor, he included elaborated constructed pavilions, mist clouds and mountain landscape painting in his work. The theme of his painting is suggesting the immortal realm which accord with the entire theme of the Jade Hall provides to its viewer the feeling of otherworldliness. Another painter, Guo Xi made another screen painting for emperor Shenzong, depicting mountains in spring in a harmonized atmosphere. The image also includes immortal elements Mount Tianlao which is one of the realms of the immortals. In his painting, Early Spring, the strong branches of the trees reflects the life force of the living creatures and implying the emperor&#x27;s benevolent rule.

=== Images of women ===
Female characters are almost excluded from traditional Chinese painting under the influence of Confucianism. Dong Zhongshu, an influential Confucian scholar in the Han dynasty, proposed the three-bond theory saying that: &quot;the ruler is Yang and the subject is Yin, father is Yang and son is Yin‚Ä¶The husband is Yang, and the wife is Yin,&quot; which places females in a subordinate position to that of males. Under the three-bond theory, women are depicted as housewives who need to obey to their husbands and fathers in literature. Similarly, in the portrait paintings, female characters are also depicted as exemplary women to elevate the rule of males. A hand roll &quot;Exemplary Women&quot;by Ku Kai Zhi, a six Dynasty artist, depicted woman characters who may be a wife, a daughter or a widow.

During the Tang dynasty, artists slowly began to appreciate the beauty of a woman&#x27;s body (shinu). Artist Zhang Xuan produced painting named &quot;palace women listening to music&quot; that captured women&#x27;s elegance and pretty faces. However, women were still being depicted as submissive and ideal within male system.

During the Song dynasty, as the love poem emerged, the images associated with those love stories were made as attractive as possible to meet the taste of the male viewers.

==Landscape painting==


=== Paradigm shift in representation ===
Northern Song landscape painting differs from Southern Song painting because of its paradigm shift in representation. If Southern Song period landscape painting is said to be looking inward, Northern Song painting is reaching outward. During the Northern Song period, the rulers&#x27; goal is to consolidate and extend the elites value across the society. Whereas Southern Song painters decided to focus on personal expression. Northern Song landscapes are regarded as &quot;real landscape&quot;, since the court appreciated the representation relationship between art and the external world, rather than the relationship between art and the artists inner voice. The painting, &quot;A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains&quot; is horizontally displayed and there are four mountain ranges arranged from left to right. Similar to another early Southern Song painter, Zhou Boju, both artists glorified their patrons by presenting the gigantic empire images in blue and green landscape painting. The only difference is that in Zhou&#x27;s painting, there are five mountain ranges arranged from right to left. The scenes in the Southern Song paintings are about north landscape that echo the memory of their lost north territory. However, ironically, some scholars suggested that Wang Ximeng&#x27;s &quot;A Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains&quot; depicts the scenes of the south not the north.

=== Buddhist and Taoist influences ===
The Chinese landscape painting are believed to be affected by the intertwining Chinese traditional religious beliefs, for example, &quot;the Taoist love of nature&quot;, and &quot;Buddhist principle of emptiness,&quot; and can represent the diversification of artists attitudes and thoughts from previous period. The Taoist love of nature is not always present in Chinese landscape painting but gradually developed from Six Dynasties period when Taoists Lao-tzu, Chuang-tzu, the Pao-p&#x27;u tzu&#x27;s thoughts are reflected in literature documents. Apart from the contemporary Confucian tradition of insisting on human cultivation and learning to be more educated and build up social framework, Taoist persist on going back to human&#x27;s origin, which is to be ignorant. Taoists believe that if one discard wise, the robbery will stop. If people abandon expensive jewelry, thieves will not exist. From the Han dynasty, the practice of Taoism was associated with alchemical and medicine made. To better pursuit Taoism belief, Taoist need to go on pilgrim into specific mountains to connect themselves with the spirits and immortals that lived in those mountains. In the third and fourth century, the practice of escaping society and going back to nature mediating in the countryside is further enhanced by a group called Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove who would like to escape from the civil unrest. The wise men fleet the world and wonder in the countryside and enjoy the tranquil landscape and forgot to return. The Taoism ideology of forgetfulness, self-cultivation, harmonizing with nature world, and purifying soul by entering the isolated mountains to mediate and seek medicine herbs create the scene of landscape painting.

During the Han dynasty, the mountains appeared in the design of the artworks shows the prevalence role of mountain in Han society. The emperor would climb on to the mountain to sacrifice and religion practice because mountains are thought to have connection between earth and heaven and can link human with spirits and immortals. And sometimes, mountains are depicted as mystical mountains&quot; (shenshan), where sages and legendary animals settled. Hence, landscape painting is used as an object for Taoism practice which provide visualize form for religious ritual. During the Six Dynasties period, the landscape painting experienced a stylistic change which myth and poem depiction were introduced into the painting. For example, in Ku Kai-chih&#x27;s &quot;Nymph of the river&quot; scroll and &quot;The Admonitions of the Court Preceptress&quot;, audience are able to read narrative description and text accompanied by visualized images.

Furthermore, in Buddhism, the mountain also has an important role in religious practice. From an iconographical point of view, a Buddha&#x27;s image is used in helping a believer to practice meditation. For instance, Buddha&#x27;s reflection image, or shadow, is assimilated with the image of a mountain, Lushan. This assimilation is also recorded in a poem by poet from the Six Dynasties period who pointed out that the beauty and numinosity of the mountain can elevate the spiritual connection between human being and the spirits. Thus, the landscape painting come into display Buddha&#x27;s image in people&#x27;s everyday ritual practice. Hui-yuan described in his poem that &quot;Lushan seems to mirror the divine appearance&quot; which unifies the two images‚Äîthe true image and the reflection of Buddha. Moreover, spiritual elevation can be achieved by contemplating in front of landscape painting which depict the same mountain and path those old sages have been to. The painting contains both the spiritual force (ling) and the truth (li) of Buddha and also the objects that no longer physically presence. Hui-Yuan&#x27;s famous image is closely relation with its landscape scene indicating the trend of transformation from Buddha image to landscape painting as a religious practice.

=== Early landscape painting ===
In Chinese society, there is a long-time appreciation of natural beauty. The early themes of poems, artworks are associated with agriculture and everyday life associates with fields, animals. On the other hand, later Chinese painting pursuits majesty and grand. Thus, mountain scenery become the most popular subject to paint because it&#x27;s high which represent human eminence. Also, mountain is stable and permanent suggests the eminent of the imperial power. Furthermore, mountain is difficult to climb showing the difficulties human will face through their lives.

Landscape painting evolved under the influence of Taoist who fled from civil turbulence and prosecution of the government and went back to the wilderness. However, the development of Taoism was hindered by Han dynasty. During Han dynasty, the empire expanded and enlarged its political and economic influence. Hence, the Taoism&#x27;s anti-social belief was disfavored by the imperial government. Han rulers only favored portrait painting which enabled their image to be perpetuate and their civilians to see and to memorize their great leaders or generals. Landscape at that time only focus on the trees for literary or talismanic value. The usage of landscape painting as ornament is suspects to be borrowed from other societies outside Han empire during its expansion to the Near East. Landscape and animal scene began to appear on the jars, but the decoration has little to do with connection with the natural world. Also, there is evidence showing that the emerging of landscape painting is not derived from map-making.

During the Three Kingdoms and Six Dynasties, landscape painting began to have connection with literati and the production of poems. Taoism influence on people&#x27;s appreciation of landscaping deceased and nature worshipping superseded. However, Taoist still used landscape painting in their meditation just as Confucius uses portrait painting in their ritual practice. (Ku Kai Chih&#x27;s admonitions) During this time period, the landscape painting is more coherence with variation trees, rocks and branches. Moreover, the painting is more elaborated and organized. The evolution in landscape painting during the Six Dynasties is that artists harmonized sprit with the nature. (Wu Tao-tzu) Buddhism might also contribute in affecting changes in landscape painting. The artists began to show space and depth in their works where they showed mountain mass, distanced hills and clouds. The emptiness of the space is helping the believers meditating to enter the space of emptiness and nothingness.

The most important development in landscape painting is that people came to recognize the infinity variation of the nature world, so they tended to make each tree individualized. Every landscape painting is restricted by storytelling and is dependent on artists memory.

=== Dyads ===
Chinese landscape painting, &quot;shanshui hua&quot; means the painting of mountains, rivers, and cliffs which are the two major components that represents the essence of the nature. Shanshui in Chinese tradition is given rich meaning, for example mountain represents Yang and river indicates Yin. According to Yin Yang theory, Yin embodies Yang and Yang involved in Yin, thus, mountain and river is inseparable and is treated as a whole in a painting. In the &quot;Mountains and rivers without end,&quot; for example, &quot;the dyad of the mountain uplift, subduction, and erosion and the planetary water cycle&quot; is consistent with the dyad of Buddhism iconography, both representing austerity and generous loving spirit.

== Art as cartography ==
&quot;Arts in maps, arts as maps, maps in arts, and maps as arts,&quot; are the four relationships between art and map. Making a distinction between map and art is difficult because there are cartographic elements in both paintings. Early Chinese map making considered earth surface as flat, so artists would not take projection into consideration. Moreover, map makers did not have the idea of map scale. Chinese people from Song dynasty called paintings, maps and other pictorial images as tu, so it&#x27;s impossible to distinguish the types of each painting by name. Artists who paint landscape as an artwork focus mainly on the natural beauty rather on the accuracy and realistic representation of the object. Map on the other hand should be depicted in a precise manner which more focus on the distance and important geographic features.

The two examples in this case:

The Changjiang Wan Li Tu, although the date and the authorship are not clear, the painting is believed to be made in Song dynasty by examining the place names recorded on the painting. Only based on the name of this painting, it is hard to distinguish whether this painting is painted as a landscape painting or as a map.

The Shu Chuan Shenggai was once thought as the product done by North Song artist Li Gonglin, however, later evidence disapproved this thought and proposed the date should be changed to the end of South Song and artist remains unknown.

Both those paintings, aiming to enhance viewers appreciation on the beauty and majesty of landscape painting, focusing on the light condition and conveying certain attitude, are characterized as masterpiece of art rather than map.

<text>Harold Allen Ramis (; November 21, 1944 ‚Äì February 24, 2014) was an American actor, comedian, and filmmaker. His film acting roles include Egon Spengler in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984) and &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (1989), and as Russell Ziskey in &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981); he also co-wrote those films. As a director, his films include the comedies &quot;Caddyshack&quot; (1980), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; (1993), &quot;Analyze This&quot; (1999) and &quot;Analyze That&quot; (2002). Ramis was the original head writer of the television series &quot;SCTV&quot;, on which he also performed, as well as a co-writer of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; (1978). The final film that he wrote, produced, directed, and acted in was &quot;Year One&quot; (2009).

Ramis&#x27; films influenced subsequent generations of comedians, comedy writers and actors. Filmmakers and actors including Jay Roach, Jake Kasdan, Adam Sandler, Judd Apatow, and Peter and Bobby Farrelly have listed his films among their favorites. Along with Danny Rubin, he won the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;.

==Early life==
Ramis was born on November 21, 1944, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Ruth (n√©e Cokee) (1919‚Äì2001) and Nathan Ramis (1915‚Äì2009), who owned the Ace Food &amp; Liquor Mart on the city&#x27;s West Side. Ramis had a Jewish upbringing. In his adult life, he did not practice any religion. He graduated from Stephen K. Hayt Elementary School in June 1958 and Nicholas Senn High School in 1962, both Chicago public schools, and in 1966 from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was a member of the Alpha Xi chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.

Afterward, Ramis worked in a mental institution in St. Louis for seven months. He later said of his time working there that it:

==Career==

===Early years===
Ramis began writing parodic plays in college, saying years later, &quot;In my heart, I felt I was a combination of Groucho and Harpo Marx, of Groucho using his wit as a weapon against the upper classes, and of Harpo&#x27;s antic charm and the fact that he was oddly sexy‚Äîhe grabs women, pulls their skirts off, and gets away with it.&quot; He avoided the Vietnam War military draft by taking methamphetamine to fail his draft physical.

Following his work in St. Louis, Ramis returned to Chicago, where by 1968, he was a substitute teacher at schools serving the inner-city Robert Taylor Homes public housing development. He also became associated with the guerrilla television collective TVTV, headed by his college friend Michael Shamberg, and wrote freelance for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. &quot;Michael Shamberg, right out of college, had started freelancing for newspapers and got on as a stringer for a local paper, and I thought, &#x27;Well, if Michael can do that, I can do that.&#x27; I wrote a spec piece and submitted it to the &quot;Chicago Daily News,&quot; the Arts &amp; Leisure section, and they started giving me assignments [for] entertainment features.&quot; Additionally, Ramis had begun studying and performing with Chicago&#x27;s Second City improvisational comedy troupe.

Ramis&#x27; newspaper writing led to him becoming joke editor at &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. &quot;I called‚Ä¶just cold and said I had written several pieces freelance and did they have any openings. And they happened to have their entry-level job, party jokes editor, open. He liked my stuff and he gave me a stack of jokes that readers had sent in and asked me to rewrite them. I had been in Second City in the workshops already and Michael Shamberg and I had written comedy shows in college.&quot; Ramis was eventually promoted to associate editor.

===National Lampoon, &quot;SCTV&quot;, and &quot;The Top&quot;===
After leaving Second City for a time and returning in 1972, having been replaced in the main cast by John Belushi, Ramis worked his way back as Belushi&#x27;s deadpan foil. In 1974, Belushi brought Ramis and other Second City performers, including Ramis&#x27; frequent future collaborator Bill Murray, to New York City to work on &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot;.

During this time, Ramis, Belushi, Murray, Joe Flaherty, Christopher Guest, and Gilda Radner starred in the revue &quot;The National Lampoon Show&quot;, the successor to &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Lemmings&quot;. Later, Ramis became a performer on, and head writer of, the Canadian sketch-comedy television series &quot;SCTV&quot; during its first three years (1976‚Äì1979). At this juncture, SCTV was seen mainly in Canada, and also via syndication in scattered markets in the US. He was soon offered work as a writer at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; but chose to continue with &quot;SCTV&quot;. Characterizations by Ramis on &quot;SCTV&quot; include weaselly, corrupt and constantly sweating &quot;Dialing for Dollars&quot; host/SCTV station manager Maurice &quot;Moe&quot; Green, outwardly amiable (but thoroughly fascist) cop Officer Friendly, exercise guru Swami Bananananda (whose real name was Dennis Peterson), stern board chairman Allan &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; Hirschman and home dentist Mort Finkel. His celebrity impressions on &quot;SCTV&quot; included Kenneth Clark and Leonard Nimoy.

In 1984, Ramis executive produced a music/comedy/variety television show called &quot;The Top&quot;. The producer was Paul Flaherty and the director was David Jove. Ramis got involved after the mysterious death of his friend Peter Ivers, who had hosted Jove&#x27;s underground show &quot;New Wave Theatre&quot;. He called Jove and offered to help. Flattery and Jove pitched him the idea for &quot;The Top&quot;, and Ramis was instrumental in getting it on the air.

The show was a mixture of live music, videos, and humor. Performers on the show included Cyndi Lauper, who performed &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; and &quot;True Colors&quot;; the Hollies, who performed &quot;Stop in the Name of Love&quot;; and the Romantics, who performed their two hits at the time, &quot;Talking in Your Sleep&quot; and &quot;What I Like About You&quot;.

Guest stars included Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd. Ramis got Bill Murray to host but, because &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; filming ran late, he did not make it to the taping. Chase came out dressed as a &quot;punk&quot; of the time and somehow got into a physical altercation with an audience member (also a punk) during the opening monologue. He immediately left the taping. Flattery and Jove carried on with the show.

Ramis then got Andy Kaufman to fill in for Chase and recorded the host segments at a separate, later, session; it would be Kaufman&#x27;s final professional appearance.

&quot;The Top&quot; aired on Friday, January 27, 1984, at 7¬†p.m. It scored a 7.7% rating and a 14% share. This represented a 28% rating increase and a 27% share increase over KTLA&#x27;s regularly scheduled &quot;Happy Days&quot;/&quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;.

===Film career===
Ramis left &quot;SCTV&quot; to pursue a film career and wrote a script with &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine&#x27;s Douglas Kenney, which eventually became &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;. They were later joined by a third collaborator, Chris Miller. The 1978 film followed the struggle between a rowdy college fraternity house and the college dean. The film&#x27;s humor was raunchy for its time. &quot;Animal House&quot; &quot;broke all box-office records for comedies&quot; and earned $141¬†million.

He also had a voice part as Zeke in the &quot;So Beautiful &amp; So Dangerous&quot; segment of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; in 1981.

Ramis next co-wrote the comedy &quot;Meatballs&quot;, starring Bill Murray. The movie was a commercial success and became the first of six film collaborations between Murray and Ramis. His third film and his directorial debut was &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, which he wrote with Kenney and Brian Doyle-Murray. It starred Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Bill Murray. Like Ramis&#x27; previous two films, &quot;Caddyshack&quot; was a commercial success.

In 1982, Ramis was attached to direct the film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; by John Kennedy Toole. The film was to star John Belushi and Richard Pryor, but the project was abandoned. In 1984, Ramis collaborated with Dan Aykroyd on the screenplay for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, which became one of the biggest comedy hits of all time, in which he also starred as Dr. Egon Spengler. He reprised the role for the 1989 sequel, &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; (which he also co-wrote with Aykroyd). His later film &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; has been called his &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

His films have been noted for attacking &quot;the smugness of institutional life‚Ä¶with an impish good [will] that is unmistakably American.&quot; They are also noted for &quot;Ramis&#x27; signature tongue-in-cheek pep talks.&quot; Sloppiness and improv were also important aspects of his work. Ramis frequently depicted the qualities of &quot;anger, curiosity, laziness, and woolly idealism&quot; in &quot;a hyper-articulate voice&quot;.

Ramis also occasionally acted in supporting roles in acclaimed films that he did not write or direct, such as James L. Brooks&#x27;s Academy Award-winning &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; (1997) and Judd Apatow&#x27;s hit comedy &quot;Knocked Up&quot; (2007).

In 2004, Ramis turned down the opportunity to direct the Bernie Mac-Ashton Kutcher film &quot;Guess Who&quot;, then under the working title &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, because he considered it poorly written. That same year, he began filming the low-budget &quot;The Ice Harvest&quot;, &quot;his first attempt to make a comic film noir.&quot; Ramis spent six weeks trying to get the film greenlit because he had difficulty reaching an agreement about stars John Cusack&#x27;s and Billy Bob Thornton&#x27;s salaries. The film received mixed reviews. In 2004, Ramis&#x27;s typical directing fee was $5¬†million.

In an interview in the documentary &quot;American Storytellers&quot;, Ramis said he hoped to make a film about Emma Goldman (even pitching Disney with the idea of having Bette Midler star) but that none of the film studios were interested and that it would have been difficult to raise the funding.

Ramis said in 2009 that he planned to make a third &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film for release either in mid-2011 or for Christmas 2012. A reboot to the franchise, also called &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, was eventually made and released in 2016, directed and co-written by Paul Feig. In this film, a bronze bust of Ramis can be seen when Erin Gilbert leaves her office at Columbia University. Later, the second sequel to the original film, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2021 and posthumously dedicated to him.

==Personal life==
Ramis was married twice and had four children. On July 2, 1967, he married San Francisco artist Anne Plotkin, with whom he had a daughter, Violet Ramis Stiel. Actor and &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; co-star Bill Murray is Violet&#x27;s godfather. Ramis and Plotkin separated in 1984 and later divorced.

Ramis&#x27; daughter Mollie Israel (known professionally as Mollie Heckerling) was born in 1985 to him and director Amy Heckerling, while Heckerling was married to actor-director Neal Israel.

In 1989, Ramis married Erica Mann, daughter of director Daniel Mann and actress Mary Kathleen Williams. Together they had two sons, Julian Arthur and Daniel Hayes in 1990 and 1994.

Although Ramis maintained humanist beliefs, Erica&#x27;s Buddhist upbringing greatly influenced his philosophies for the rest of his life, and he became friends with the Dalai Lama.

Ramis was a Chicago Cubs fan, and when he moved back from Los Angeles to Chicago in the late 1990s, he would attend games at Wrigley Field, sometimes taking part of the seventh-inning stretch of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot;. His pastimes included fencing, ritual drumming, acoustic guitar, and making hats from felted fleece; additionally, he taught himself to ski by watching skiers on television.

==Illness and death==

In May 2010, Ramis contracted an infection that resulted in complications from autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis and lost the ability to walk. After relearning to walk he suffered a relapse of the disease in late 2011.

He died of complications of the disease on February 24, 2014, at his home on Chicago&#x27;s North Shore, at age 69. A private funeral was held for him two days later with family, friends, and several collaborators in attendance, including Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, David Pasquesi, Andrew Alexander, and the widows of John Belushi and Bernard Sahlins. He is buried at Shalom Memorial Park in Arlington Heights.

Upon Ramis&#x27; death, then-President Barack Obama released a statement, saying, &quot;When we watched his movies‚Äîfrom &quot;Animal House&quot; and &quot;Caddyshack&quot; to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;‚Äîwe didn&#x27;t just laugh until it hurt. We questioned authority. We identified with the outsider. We rooted for the underdog. And through it all, we never lost our faith in happy endings.&quot; He ended his statement by saying he hoped Ramis &quot;received total consciousness&quot;, in reference to a line from &quot;Caddyshack&quot;.

Ramis and longtime collaborator Bill Murray had a falling out during the filming of &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, which Ramis attributed to problems that Murray had in his own life at the time, plus creative differences between the two about the overall direction and mood of the film. Afterwards, they did not speak for more than 20 years, nor did they ever collaborate in any films. Shortly before Ramis&#x27; death, Murray, encouraged by his brother Brian Doyle-Murray, visited him to make amends with a box of doughnuts and a police escort, according to Ramis&#x27; daughter Violet. At that point, Ramis had lost most of his ability to speak, so Murray did most of the talking over several hours, as the two finally made peace. Murray gave a tribute to Ramis at the 86th Academy Awards.

Stephen Colbert paid tribute to Ramis on an episode of his show &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. Colbert said that &quot;as a young, bookish man with glasses looking for a role model, I might have picked Harold Ramis.&quot; He ended the show by thanking him.

==Awards and honors==
In 2004, Ramis was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In 2005, he received the Austin Film Festival&#x27;s Distinguished Screenwriter Award. In 2010, he received a lifetime achievement award from the Chicago Improv Festival. In 2015, the Writers Guild of America posthumously honored him with their lifetime achievement award, the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement.

In 2016, two years after his death, The Second City founded the Harold Ramis Film School, the first film school to focus solely on film comedy, in his honor.

The 2016 film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, a reboot of the series Ramis co-created and starred in, was posthumously dedicated to him. A bust of Ramis appears in the film. In the 2021 movie &quot;&quot;, the age-progressed image of Ramis appears as the ghost of Egon Spengler; a dedication before the end credits also reads &quot;for Harold.&quot;

On February 2, 2024, Chicago declared every February 2nd going forward to be &quot;Harold Ramis Day&quot;.

==Collaborations==
Ramis frequently collaborated with director Ivan Reitman. He co-wrote &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, which Reitman produced, then co-wrote the Reitman comedy &quot;Meatballs&quot;; he co-wrote and appeared in the Reitman films &quot;Stripes&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, and &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;.

<text>Helmut Sturm (21 February 1932 ‚Äì 20 February 2008) was a German painter.

He was born in Furth im Wald. From 1952 to 1958, he studied at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste, Munich. After this he joined Heimrad Prem, Lothar Fischer and Hans-Peter Zimmer in founding Gruppe SPUR, which in 1959 entered the Situationist International. He had a six-month scholarship in Paris before returning to Munich for the SPUR exhibition in Galerie van de Loo. He collaborated with Hans Platschek, Asger Jorn, J√∏rgen Nash, Constant, Maurice Wyckaert, Giuseppe Pinot-Gallizio and Guy Debord. In 1961 he stayed with Nash at Oerkelljunga, Sweden with Prem, Zimmer and Dieter Kunzelmann.

After the SPUR group was expelled from the Situationist International, they continued to do collaborative work, linking up with &quot;Wir&quot; in 1966 to form Geflecht. Sturm developed colorspatial anti-objects and had his first solo exhibition in the Galerie van de Loo, Munich.

From 1970 he worked as an Art educator, developing a Child Forum with Galerie van de Loo. In 1975 he set up the &quot;Kollektiv Herzogstrasse&quot; with Prem. From 1980 to 1982, he was guest professor at the Hochschule der K√ºnste, Berlin, taking over Hann Trier&#x27;s class. He continued to exhibit across Germany and from 1985 to 1998 was professor at the Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste, Munich. He died in February 2008 in Munich.

<text>The common ringed plover or ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula) is a species of bird in the family Charadriidae. It breeds across much of northern Eurasia, as well as Greenland.

==Taxonomy==
The common ringed plover was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the current binomial name &quot;Charadrius hiaticula&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;Europa &amp; America&quot; but this is now restricted to Sweden. The specific epithet &quot;hiaticula&quot; is late Medieval Latin for a plover.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;C. h. psammodromus&quot; Salomonsen, 1930 ‚Äì Arctic of North Atlantic: Ellesmere Island and Baffin Island (northeast Canada, sporadic); Greenland, Iceland, Faroe Islands and Svalbard (north of Norway)
* &quot;C. h. hiaticula&quot; Linnaeus, 1758 ‚Äì temperate east North Atlantic region: British Isles and northwest France to south Scandinavia and Baltic States
* &quot;C. h. tundrae&quot; (Lowe, 1915) ‚Äì Arctic Ocean coasts, islands: north Scandinavia to Chukchi Peninsula (northeast Siberia) including Novaya Zemlya and New Siberian Islands (north of northwest, northeast Russia) and St. Lawrence Island (north Bering Sea; erratic)

The subspecies &quot;C. h. psammodromus&quot; is poorly differentiated from the nominate and is not recognised by some ornithologists.

==Description==
Adults are in length with a wingspan. They have a grey-brown back and wings, a white belly, and a white breast with one black neckband. They have a brown cap, a white forehead, a black mask around the eyes and a short orange and black bill. The legs are orange and only the outer two toes are slightly webbed, unlike the slightly smaller but otherwise very similar semipalmated plover, which has all three toes slightly webbed, and also a marginally narrower breast band; it was in former times included in the present species. Juvenile ringed plovers are duller than the adults in colour, with an often incomplete grey-brown breast band, a dark bill and dull yellowish-grey legs.

This species differs from the smaller little ringed plover in leg colour, the head pattern, and the lack of an obvious yellow eye-ring.

==Distribution and habitat==
The common ringed plover&#x27;s breeding habitat is open ground on beaches or flats across northern Eurosiberia and in Arctic northeast Canada. Some birds breed inland, and in western Europe they nest as far south as northern France. They nest on the ground in an open area with little or no plant growth.

Common ringed plovers are migratory and winter in coastal areas south to Africa. In Norway, geolocators have revealed that adult breeding birds migrate to West Africa. Many birds in Great Britain and northern France are resident throughout the year.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===
Common ringed plovers breed from one year of age. They are seasonally monogamous and the pair-bond is sometimes maintained from one year to the next. They are solitary nesters and are territorial. Egg laying generally begins in May but the date varies depending on the region. The nest is a shallow scrape lined with pebbles and pieces of vegetation. The clutch is of 3 to 4 eggs. The eggs are laid of intervals of 1 to 3 days and are incubated by both parents beginning after the last or penultimate egg. They hatch after 21 to 27 days. The downy chicks are grey-buff mottled with cinnamon-buff above and white below. The young are precocial and nidifugous. They are cared for by both parents and can feed themselves. While small they are brooded at night and in bad weather. They fledge when aged around 24 days. 

If a potential predator approaches the nest, the adult will walk away from the scrape, calling to attract the intruder and feigning a broken wing.

===Food and feeding===
These birds forage for food on beaches, tidal flats and fields, usually by sight. They eat insects, crustaceans and worms and forage both by day and by night. They sometimes use foot-trembling to reveal location of prey.

==Conservation status==
The common ringer plover has an extremely large range with a large population size and is therefore evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be of &quot;Least Concern&quot;. The common ringed plover is one of the taxa to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

<text>Tristan (Latin/Brythonic:¬†&quot;Drustanus&quot;; ), also known as Tristram, Tristyn or Tristain and similar names, is the folk hero of the legend of Tristan and Iseult. In the legend, his objective is escorting the Irish princess Iseult to wed Tristan&#x27;s uncle, King Mark of Cornwall. Tristan and Iseult accidentally drink a love potion during the journey and fall in love, beginning an adulterous relationship that eventually leads to Tristan&#x27;s banishment and death. The character&#x27;s first recorded appearance is in retellings of British mythology from the 12th century by Thomas of Britain and Gottfried von Strassburg, and later in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;. He is featured in Arthurian legends, including the seminal text &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, as a skilled knight and a friend of Lancelot. He is also a Knight of the Round Table.

The historical roots of Tristan are unclear; his association with Cornwall may originate from the Tristan Stone, a 6th-century granite pillar in Cornwall inscribed with the name &quot;Drustanus&quot; (a variant of &quot;Tristan&quot;). He has been depicted in numerous historical and modern works of literature, music, and cinema.

==Tristan==
In the story of Tristan and Iseult, Tristan is the nephew of King Mark of Cornwall, sent to fetch Iseult from Ireland to wed the king. He and Iseult accidentally consume a love potion while en route and fall helplessly in love with each other. The pair then undergoes numerous trials that test their secret affair, before the tragic end.

Tristan made his first recorded appearance in the 12th century in British mythology circulating in the north of France and the Kingdom of Brittany, which had close ancestral and cultural links with Wales, Cornwall and Devon by way of the ancient British kingdom of Dumnonia, as made clear in the story itself, and the closely related Cornish and Breton languages, both of which are P-Celtic like Welsh. Although the oldest stories concerning Tristan are lost, some of the derivatives still exist. 

Most early versions fall into one of two branches: the &quot;courtly&quot; branch represented in the retellings in Thomas of Britain&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot; and his German successor Gottfried von Strassburg, and in the &quot;Folie Tristan d&#x27;Oxford&quot;; and the &quot;common&quot; branch, including the works of medieval French literature. 

Arthurian romancer Chr√©tien de Troyes mentioned in his poem &quot;Clig√®s&quot; that he composed his own account of the story; however, there are no surviving copies or records of any such text. In the 13th century, during the great period of prose romances, &quot;Tristan en prose&quot; or Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; became one of the most popular romances of its time. This long, sprawling, and often lyrical work (the modern edition takes up thirteen volumes) follows Tristan from the traditional legend into the realm of King Arthur where Tristan participates in the Quest for the Holy Grail. Its great success spawned many Italian (such as the &quot;Tavola Ritonda&quot;) and other rewrites. Among these was the French Post-Vulgate Cycle that combined it with a shortened version of the Vulgate Cycle, elements of which itself had been earlier used in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;.

==Name==
The ancient Brittonic name &quot;Tristan&quot; appears to mean &quot;clanking swords of iron&quot;. The more recent Romance languages version, including French, has been paretymologically associated with &quot;sadness&quot; (compare Latin &quot;tristis&quot; &quot;sad&quot;, Old French &quot;triste&quot; &quot;sad&quot;). In Gottfried von Strassburg&#x27;s &quot;Tristan&quot;, when his mother, Blanschfleur, learns that her husband has been killed in battle, she dies in childbirth. The orphaned baby is named &quot;Tristan&quot; because of the sorrowful circumstances of his birth. 

The quasi-historical, semi-legendary &quot;Pictish Chronicle&quot; (probably late 10th century) presents several ancient Pictish kings by the name of &quot;Drest&quot; or &quot;Drust&quot;. The Picts are believed to have lived in present-day Scotland far to the northwest of Cornwall. The form &quot;Drustanus&quot; is merely &quot;Drust&quot; or hypocoristic &quot;Drustan&quot; rendered into Latin. The name may have originated with an ancient legend regarding a Pictish king who slew a giant in the distant past, which had spread throughout the Isles, it may come from a 6th-century Pictish saint Drostan who bore another form of the name, or it may have migrated northwards from the southwest due to the fame of the legends of Arthur. There was a Tristan who bore witness to a legal document at the Swabian Abbey of Saint Gall in 807.

The philologist Sigmund Eisner came to the conclusion that the name &quot;Tristan&quot; comes from Drust, son of Talorc. This Drust is probably otherwise unknown to us, because the sons of Pictish kings never became kings themselves. According to Eisner, the legend of Tristan as we know it was gathered together by an author living in North Britain around the early 8th century and associated with early Celtic monasticism. Eisner explains that Irish monks of this time would have been familiar with the Greek and Roman narratives that the legend borrows from, such as Pyramus and Thisbe. They would also have been familiar with the Celtic elements of the story such as in &quot;The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gr√°inne&quot;. Eisner concludes that &quot;the author of the Tristan story used the names and some of the local traditions of his own recent past. To these figures he attached adventures which had been handed down from Roman and Greek mythology. He lived in the north of Britain, was associated with a monastery, and started the first rendition of the Tristan story on its travels to wherever it has been found.&quot;

==In &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;==
Thomas Malory later shortened and incorporated the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; into his own English-language &quot;The Book of Sir Tristram de Lyones&quot; (&quot;The Fyrste and the Secunde Boke of Syr Trystrams de Lyones&quot;), a part of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; in which Tristan (Tristram) plays the role of a counter-hero to Lancelot. Of all the knights, Tristram most resembles Lancelot as he too loves a queen, the wife of another. Tristan is even considered to be as strong and able a knight as Lancelot, including the fulfillment of Merlin&#x27;s prophecy for the two of them to engage in the greatest duel between any knights before or after, although neither kills the other and they become beloved friends. &quot;[T]he depiction of their chivalric prowess eclipses, for large sections of the narratives, their love for their respective queens.&quot; His other friends and companions include Dinadan and Lamorak.

In Malory&#x27;s telling, following the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, the mother of Tristan, Queen Elizabeth, dies during childbirth while desperately searching for his father King Meliodas after he was kidnapped by an enchantress (of a fairy kind in the original, unspecified by Malory) to be her lover. The young Tristan meets and falls in love with Isolde (Iseult) early on. His uncle, King Mark, jealous of Tristan and seeking to undermine him, seeks marriage to Isolde for just such a hateful purpose, going so far as to ask Tristram to go and seek her hand on his behalf (which Tristran, understanding that to be his knightly duty, does). Because of Mark&#x27;s treacherous behaviour, Tristran takes Isolde from him and lives with her for some time in Lancelot&#x27;s castle Joyous Gard, but he then returns Isolde to Mark. Nonetheless, Mark ends up ambushing and mortally injuring Tristram while he is harping (Tristan is noted in the book as one of the greatest of musicians and falconers), using a lance that had been given to him by the vengeful enchantress Morgan, whose lover had been slain by Tristan.

==Differences between versions==
Thomas of Britain draws on the &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; for historical details, and follows its example in matters of style. Gottfried draws more on the learned tradition of medieval humanism than on the chivalric ethos shared by his literary contemporaries. 

Tristan was originally the son of Queen Blancheflor and King Rivalen. In later versions since the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, his parents are Queen Isabelle (Malory&#x27;s Elizabeth, known as Eliabel or Eliabella in Italy) and King Meliodas of Lyonesse.

At the end of Joseph Bedier&#x27;s &quot;The Romance of Tristan and Iseult,&quot; a pair of flowers grow over the graves of Tristan and Iseult.

==Historical roots==

B√©roul&#x27;s Norman French &quot;Romance of Tristan and Iseult&quot;, possibly the earliest extant version, is notable for its very specific geographical locations in Cornwall. Another strange aspect is Tristan&#x27;s home-kingdom, Lyonesse, for whose existence there is no evidence. However, there were two places called &quot;Leonais&quot;: one in Brittany, the other the Old French transcription of Lothian. Regardless, Tristan being a prince of Lothian would make his name more sensible, Lothian being on the borderlands of the Pictish High-Kingship (and once a part of Pictish territory; Tristan may in fact have been a Pictish prince under a British king). There are also records of a Turstan Crectune, whose name gave the Lothian village of Crichton its name. King David I of Scotland granted lands to Turstan Crectune in 1128. One other suggestion sees Tristan as adopted into the family of Mark of Cornwall ‚Äì a historical practice attested in Roman law.

==The Tristan Stone==
Possible evidence for his roots in South West England is the 6th-century inscribed granite pillar known as &quot;The Tristan Stone&quot;, or &quot;The Longstone&quot; (, meaning &quot;long stone&quot;), set beside the road leading to Fowey in Cornwall. It measures some 2.13 m (7 feet) in height and has been set in a modern concrete base. Until the 1980s it was in its original position some yards from the coastal road in a field near the turn down to the small harbour of Polkerris. It was then closer to Castle Dore and may have been the origin of the association of this site with the story of the tragic love of Tristan and Iseult. There is a Tau cross on one side and a Latin inscription on the other side, now much worn, reading:
&quot;DRVSTANVS HIC IACIT&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;CVNOMORI FILIVS&quot;&lt;br&gt;
[&quot;Drustanus lies here, son of Cunomorus&quot;]


It has been suggested, and is confidently asserted on the plaque by the stone, that the characters referred to are Tristan, of which Drustan is a variant and Cynvawr Latinized to Cunomorus. Cynvawr, in turn, is said by the 9th-century author Nennius, who compiled an early pseudo-historical account of King Arthur, to be identified with King Mark known in alias &#x27;QVONOMORVS&#x27;. Around 1540, John Leland recorded a third line now missing: CVM DOMINA OUSILLA (&#x27;with the lady Ousilla&#x27;: Ousilla is conceivably a latinisation of the Cornish &quot;Eselt&quot;), but missed the badly weathered first line (&#x27;DRUSTANVS HIC IACIT&#x27;) which has led Craig Weatherhill to speculate that this third line could have been lost by stone fracture, but which has also led Goulven Peron to propose to see &#x27;OUSILLA&#x27; as a particular reading of &#x27;DRUSTANVS&#x27;. 

==Modern works==
*From 1857 to 1859, Richard Wagner composed the opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, now considered one of the most influential pieces of music of the 19th century. In his work, Tristan is portrayed as a doomed romantic figure.
*&quot;I due Tristani&quot; (&quot;The Two Tristans&quot;) was a 1555 adaptation of the Spanish &quot;Don Tristan de Leonis&quot;, featured Tristram&#x27;s son (&quot;Tristram the Younger&quot;), and emphasized romantic themes - following a trend of interest in more sentimental novels.
*Algernon Charles Swinburne published the epic poem &quot;Tristram of Lyonesse&quot; in 1882.
*In 1900, Joseph Bedier published his novel, &quot;The Romance of Tristan and Iseult.&quot;
*The legend of Tristan has been represented through the song of the same name by English singer-songwriter Patrick Wolf, and was the lead single from his 2005 album, &quot;Wind in the Wires&quot;.
*Tristan plays a prominent role in the comic book series &quot;Camelot 3000&quot;, in which he is reincarnated in the year 3000, as a woman and subsequently struggles to come to terms with his new body, sexuality, and identity, reconciling them in turn with his previous notions of gender roles.
*In 1983, Russian composer Nikita Koshkin wrote a classical guitar solo entitled &quot;Tristan Playing the Lute&quot;, evoking the spirit of Tristan from the legend of &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;, initially set in a playful adaptation of traditional English lute music.
*In &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot; novel series by Bernard Cornwell, Tristan is the young heir to Kernow and the son of King Mark. He is the best friend of the protagonist Derfel Cadarn and a loyal ally of Arthur. Eventually, however, in an agonising decision for the sake of peace and out of his deep belief in royal legitimacy, Arthur betrays Tristan and Iseault when they seek refuge and leaves them to be killed by King Mark.
*In the 2004 film, &quot;King Arthur&quot;, based on the Sarmatian connection theory of origin for the Arthurian legends, Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen) is a prominent member of the knights, who are Sarmatians serving under a half-Roman Arthur in the 5th century. Tristan is a cavalry archer, able to make amazing shots with his Parthian/Eurasian-style reflex composite bow. He uses a Chinese sword and holds true to the style, armour, and weapons, of a Sarmatian mounted archer. After many injuries, he dies a heroic death at the hand of the Saxon king Cerdic in single combat at the Battle of Badon Hill.
*The 2006 film &quot;Tristan &amp; Isolde&quot; starred James Franco as Tristan, Thomas Sangster as the child Tristan and Sophia Myles as Isolde, written by Dean Georgaris and directed by Kevin Reynolds.
*The 2008 TV show &quot;Merlin&quot; depicts Tristan and his partner Isolde as smugglers in the Season 4 finale &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; parts 1 &amp; 2. They help Arthur, Merlin, and the Knights regain Camelot after Morgana takes over. In the end, Isolde is killed by Helios, Morgana&#x27;s henchman, but nothing is said of what happens with Tristan.
*In the manga series &quot;Four Knights of the Apocalypse&quot;, Tristan is one of the titular knights, son of Meliodas and Elizabeth of Liones.
*Tristan is also a playable character in the mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; as an Archer class Servant who uses a harp as his bow.
*In Guy Ritchie&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;King Arthur: Legend of the Sword&quot;, Kingsley Ben-Adir plays Wet Stick, Arthur and Back Lack&#x27;s childhood friend; who is later knighted by Bedivere under his real name as Sir Tristan.

<doc id="277607" wikidata="Q190469" url="?curid=277607" title="Bull shark">
<text>The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark (informally zambi) in Africa and [[Lake Nicaragua]] shark in Nicaragua, is a species of requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. It is known for its aggressive nature, and presence mainly in warm, shallow brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and (usually) lower reaches of rivers. Their aggressive nature has led to ongoing shark-culling efforts near beaches to protect beachgoers, which is one of the causes of bull shark populations continuing to decrease. Bull sharks are currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.

Bull sharks are euryhaline and can thrive in both salt and fresh water. They are known to travel far up rivers, and have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, about from the ocean, but few freshwater interactions with humans have been recorded. Larger-sized bull sharks are probably responsible for the majority of nearshore shark attacks, including many incidents of shark bites attributed to other species.

Unlike the river sharks of the genus &quot;Glyphis&quot;, bull sharks are not true freshwater sharks, despite their ability to survive in freshwater habitats.

This shark appears in the image of the 2000 colones bill from Costa Rica.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;bull shark&quot; comes from the shark&#x27;s stocky shape, broad, flat snout, and aggressive, unpredictable behavior. In India, the bull shark may be confused with the Sundarbans or Ganges shark. In Africa, it is also commonly called the Zambezi River shark, or just &quot;zambi&quot;.

Its wide range and diverse habitats result in many other local names, including Ganges River shark, Fitzroy Creek whaler, van Rooyen&#x27;s shark, Lake Nicaragua shark, river shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, Swan River whaler, cub shark, and shovelnose shark.

== Evolution ==
Some of the bull shark&#x27;s closest living relatives do not have the capabilities of osmoregulation. Its genus, &quot;Carcharhinus&quot;, also includes the sandbar shark, which is not capable of osmoregulation.

The bull shark shares numerous similarities with river sharks of the genus &quot;Glyphis&quot;, and other species in the genus &quot;Carcharhinus&quot;, but its phylogeny has not been cleared yet.

==Anatomy and appearance==
Bull sharks are large and stout, with females being larger than males. The bull shark can be up to in length at birth. Adult female bull sharks average long and typically weigh , whereas the slightly smaller adult male averages and . While a maximum size of is commonly reported, a single record exists of a female specimen of exactly . A long pregnant individual reached . The maximum weight can be over , ranking it among the largest of the requiem sharks. Bull sharks are wider and heavier than other requiem sharks of comparable length, and are grey on top and white below. The second dorsal fin is smaller than the first. The bull shark&#x27;s caudal fin is longer and lower than that of the larger sharks, and it has a small snout, and lacks an interdorsal ridge.

Bull sharks have a bite force up to , weight for weight the highest among all investigated cartilaginous fishes.

===Exceptional specimens===
In early June 2012, off the coast of the Florida Keys near the western part of the Atlantic Ocean, a female believed to measure at least and was caught by members of the R.J. Dunlap Marine Conservation Program. In the Arabian Sea, off the coast of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, a pregnant shark weighing and measuring long was caught in February 2019, followed by another specimen weighing about and measuring about the same in length, in January 2020. Unconfirmed reports suggest that the very largest, exceptional specimens can possibly weigh up to .

==Distribution and habitat==
The bull shark is commonly found worldwide in coastal areas of warm oceans, in rivers and lakes, and occasionally salt and freshwater streams if they are deep enough. It is found to a depth of , but does not usually swim deeper than . In the Atlantic, it is found from Massachusetts to southern Brazil, and from Morocco to Angola.

Populations of bull sharks are also found in several major rivers, with more than 500 bull sharks thought to be living in the Brisbane River. One was reportedly seen swimming the flooded streets of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, during the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods. Several were sighted in one of the main streets of Goodna, Queensland, shortly after the peak of the January 2011, floods. A large bull shark was caught in the canals of Scarborough, just north of Brisbane within Moreton Bay. Still greater numbers are in the canals of the Gold Coast, Queensland. In the warmer months of the year, bull sharks frequent Sydney Harbour. In the Pacific Ocean, it can be found from Baja California to Ecuador.

The bull shark has traveled up the Amazon River to Iquitos in Peru and north Bolivia. It also lives in freshwater Lake Nicaragua, in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers of West Bengal, and Assam in Eastern India and adjoining Bangladesh. It can live in water with a high salt content as in St. Lucia Estuary in South Africa. Bull sharks have been recorded in the Tigris River since at least 1924 as far upriver as Baghdad, and has been rumored to also inhabit the Cahora Bassa lake upstream of the Zambezi. The species has a distinct preference for warm currents.

After Hurricane Katrina, many bull sharks were sighted in Lake Pontchartrain. In July 2023 some local fishermen in the Atchafalaya River have reported increasing numbers. Bull sharks have occasionally gone as far upstream in the Mississippi River as Alton, Illinois. Bull sharks have also been found in the Potomac River in St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland. From 1996 to 2013, a golf course lake at Carbrook, Logan City, Queensland, Australia was the home to several bull sharks. They were trapped following a flood of the Logan and Albert Rivers in 1996, and resided in the lake until 2013, when they disappeared after another series of floods. The golf course capitalized on the novelty, changing their logo to feature the sharks and hosting a monthly tournament called the &quot;Shark Lake Challenge&quot;.

==Behavior==
===Freshwater tolerance===
The bull shark is the best known of 43 species of elasmobranch, across 10 genera and four families, to have been reported in fresh and/or brackish water. Other species that enter rivers include the stingrays (Dasyatidae, Potamotrygonidae and others) and sawfish (Pristidae). Some skates (Rajidae), smooth dogfishes (Triakidae), and sandbar sharks (&quot;Carcharhinus plumbeus&quot;) regularly enter estuaries.

The bull shark is diadromous, meaning they can swim between salt and fresh water with ease, as they are euryhaline fish‚Äîable to quickly adapt to a wide range of salinities. Thus, the bull shark is one of the few cartilaginous fishes that have been reported in freshwater systems. Many of the euryhaline fish are bony fishes, such as salmon or tilapia, and are not closely related to bull sharks. Evolutionary assumptions can be made to help explain this sort of evolutionary disconnect, with one being that the bull shark experienced a population bottleneck during the last ice age. This bottleneck may have separated the bull shark from the rest of the Elasmobranchii subclass and favored the genes for an osmoregulatory system.

Elasmobranchs&#x27; ability to enter fresh water is limited because their blood is normally at least as salty (in terms of osmotic strength) as seawater through the accumulation of urea and trimethylamine oxide, but bull sharks living in fresh water show a significantly reduced concentration of urea within their blood. Despite this, the solute composition (i.e. osmolarity) of a bull shark in fresh water is still much higher than that of the external environment. This results in a large influx of water across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the shark&#x27;s body. However, bull sharks in fresh water possess several organs with which to maintain appropriate salt and water balance; these are the rectal gland, kidneys, liver, and gills. All elasmobranchs have a rectal gland which functions in the excretion of excess salts accumulated as a consequence of living in seawater. Bull sharks in freshwater environments decrease the salt-excretory activity of the rectal gland, thereby conserving sodium and chloride. The kidneys produce large amounts of dilute urine, but also play an important role in the active reabsorption of solutes into the blood. The gills of bull sharks are likely to be involved in the uptake of sodium and chloride from the surrounding fresh water, whereas urea is produced in the liver as required with changes in environmental salinity. Recent work also shows that the differences in density of fresh water to that of marine waters result in significantly greater negative buoyancies in sharks occupying fresh water, resulting in increasing costs of living in fresh water. Bull sharks caught in freshwater have subsequently been shown to have lower liver densities than sharks living in marine waters. This may reduce the added cost of greater negative buoyancy.

Bull sharks are able to regulate themselves to live in either fresh or salt water. It can live in fresh water for its entire life, but this does not happen, mostly due to the reproductive needs of the shark. Young bull sharks leave the brackish water in which they are born and move out into the sea to breed. While is theoretically possible for bull sharks to live purely in fresh water, experiments conducted on bull sharks found that they died within four years. The stomach was opened and all that was found were two small, unidentifiable fishes. The cause of death could have been starvation since the primary food source for bull sharks resides in salt water.

In a research experiment, the bull sharks were found to be at the mouth of an estuary for the majority of the time. They stayed at the mouth of the river independent of the salinity of the water. The driving factor for a bull shark to be in fresh or salt water, however, is its age; as the bull shark ages, its tolerance for very low or high salinity increases. The majority of the newborn or very young bull sharks were found in the freshwater area, whereas the much older bull sharks were found to be in the saltwater areas, as they had developed a much better tolerance for the salinity. Reproduction is one of the reasons why adult bull sharks travel into the river‚Äîit is thought to be a physiological strategy to improve juvenile survival and a way to increase overall fitness of bull sharks. The young are not born with a high tolerance for high salinity, so they are born in fresh water and stay there until they are able to travel out.

Initially, scientists thought the sharks in Lake Nicaragua belonged to an endemic species, the Lake Nicaragua shark (&quot;Carcharhinus nicaraguensis&quot;). In 1961, following specimen comparisons, taxonomists synonymized them. Bull sharks tagged inside the lake have later been caught in the open ocean (and vice versa), with some taking as few as seven to 11 days to complete the journey.

A study of six bull sharks confined to a stagnant golf course lake in Brisbane, Australia, from 1996 to 2013 uncovered their adaptability to low-salinity environments, marking the longest recorded residency for the species under such conditions, and demonstrating their ability to live indefinitely in low-salinity aquatic environments.

===Diet===
The bull shark is a marine apex predator, capable of taking a variety of prey. The bull shark&#x27;s diet consists mainly of bony fish and small sharks, including other bull sharks, and stingrays. Their diet can also include turtles, birds, dolphins, terrestrial mammals, crustaceans, and echinoderms. They hunt in murky waters where it is harder for the prey to see the shark coming. Bull sharks have been known to use the bump-and-bite technique to attack their prey. After the first initial contact, they continue to bite and tackle prey until the prey is unable to flee.

The bull shark is a solitary hunter, though may briefly pair with another bull shark to make hunting and tricking prey easier.

Sharks are opportunistic feeders, and the bull shark is no exception to this, as it is part of the &quot;Carcharhinus&quot; family of sharks. Normally, sharks eat in short bursts, and when food is scarce, sharks digest for a much longer period of time in order to avoid starvation. As part of their survival mechanism, bull sharks will regurgitate the food in their stomachs in order to escape from a predator. This is a distraction tactic; if the predator moves to eat the regurgitated food the bull shark can use the opportunity to escape.

===Reproduction===
Bull sharks mate during late summer and early autumn, often in bays and estuaries. After gestating for 12 months, a bull shark may give birth to 1 to 13 live young.

They are viviparous, born live and free-swimming. The young are about at birth. The bull shark does not rear its young; the young bull sharks are born into flat, protected areas. Coastal lagoons, river mouths, and other low-salinity estuaries are common nursery habitats.

The male bull shark is able to begin reproducing around the age of 15 years while the female cannot begin reproducing until the age of 18 years. The size of a fully matured female bull shark to produce viable eggs for fertilization seems to be 175¬†cm to 235¬†cm. The courting routine between bull sharks has not been observed in detail as of yet. The male likely bites the female on the tail until she can turn upside down and the male can copulate at that point. Mature females commonly have scratches from the mating process.

===Interactions with humans===

Since bull sharks often dwell in very shallow waters, are found in many types of habitats, are territorial by nature, and have no tolerance for provocation, they may be more dangerous to humans than any other species of shark. Bull sharks are one of the three shark species (along with the tiger shark and great white shark) most likely to bite humans.

One or several bull sharks may have been responsible for the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916. While it is a common misconception that these attacks were the inspiration for the novel &quot;Jaws&quot;, its author Peter Benchley has stated this is not the case. The speculation that bull sharks may have been responsible is based on two fatal bites occurring in brackish and fresh water.

Bull sharks have attacked swimmers around the Sydney Harbour inlets. In India, bull sharks swim up the Ganges, Bramaputra, Mahanadi, and other Indian rivers and have bitten bathers. Many of these bite incidents were attributed to the Ganges shark, &quot;Glyphis gangeticus&quot;, a critically endangered river shark species, although the sand tiger shark was also blamed during the 1960s and 1970s.

Bull sharks have also attacked humans off the coast of Florida.

===Visual cues===
Behavioral studies have confirmed that sharks can take visual cues to discriminate between different objects. The bull shark is able to discriminate between colors of mesh netting that is present underwater. It was found that bull sharks tended to avoid mesh netting of bright colors rather than colors that blended in with the water. Bright yellow mesh netting was found to be easily avoided when it was placed in the path of the bull shark. This was found to be the reason that sharks are attracted to bright yellow survival gear rather than ones that were painted black.

===Energy conservation===
In 2008, researchers tagged and recorded the movements of young bull sharks in the Caloosahatchee River estuary. They were testing to find out what determined the movement of the young bull sharks. It was found that the young bull sharks synchronously moved downriver when the environmental conditions changed. This large movement of young bull sharks were found to be moving as a response rather than other external factors such as predators. The movement was found to be directly related to the bull shark conserving energy for itself. One way the bull shark is able to conserve energy is that when the tidal flow changes, the bull shark uses the tidal flow in order to conserve energy as it moves downriver. Another way for the bull shark to conserve energy is to decrease the amount of energy needed to osmoregulate the surrounding environment.

==Ecology==
Humans are the biggest threat to bull sharks. Larger sharks, such as the tiger shark and great white shark, may attack them, but typically only target juveniles. Crocodiles may be a threat to bull sharks in rivers. Saltwater crocodiles have been observed preying on bull sharks in the rivers and estuaries of Northern Australia, and a Nile crocodile was reportedly sighted consuming a bull shark in South Africa.

== Conservation ==

The bull shark is listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List and the population is currently reported as decreasing. Despite their status, the species isn&#x27;t named as a protected species. Threats to the bull shark are numerous, such as getting caught in fishing nets, overfishing for their oil, skin, and meat, pollution to their habitat, and more. In many areas of the world, including Australia and South Africa, there are shark-culling measures around beaches to prevent attacks on beach-goers. Researchers tried to fix the problem of sharks getting too close to land by testing out a device called the SharkSafe Barrier‚Ñ¢. This barrier used magnetic and visual stimuli, which utilized rows of piping to create a continuous magnetic field to deter the sharks. However, researchers concluded that the technology needs to be improved upon and tested further before it can be implemented as a reliable safety measure. Other research is being conducted to come up with conservation solutions for the bull sharks. One example is The Nature Conservancy satellite tagging sharks to track their migration and find their habitats in order to guide what areas require further protection projects.

<text>Ploceidae is a family of small passerine birds, many of which are called weavers, weaverbirds, weaver finches, or bishops. These names come from the nests of intricately woven vegetation created by birds in this family. In most recent classifications, the Ploceidae are a clade that excludes some birds that have historically been placed in the family, such as some of the sparrows, but which includes the monotypic subfamily Amblyospizinae. The family is believed to have originated in the mid-Miocene. All birds of the Ploceidae are native to the Old World, most in Africa south of the Sahara, though a few live in tropical areas of Asia. A few species have been introduced outside their native range.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The family Ploceidae was introduced (as Ploce√Ødes) by Swedish zoologist Carl Jakob Sundevall in 1836. Phylogenetic studies have shown that the family is sister to a clade containing the families Viduidae and Estrildidae Their common ancestor lived in the middle Miocene around 18 million years ago.

A 2017 molecular phylogenetic study by Thilina de Silva and collaborators, as well as an expanded study by the same group published in 2019 have indicated that the genus &quot;Ploceus&quot; as currently defined is polyphyletic. A cladogram based on these results is shown below.
===Genera===
The family includes 15 genera with a total of 122 species. For more detail, see list of Ploceidae species.

==Description==
The males of many species in this family are brightly coloured, usually in red or yellow and black. Some species show variation in colour only in the breeding season. These are seed-eating birds with rounded conical bills.

==Distribution and habitat==
The weaverbird colonies may be found close to bodies of water.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Weavers are named for their elaborately woven nests. The nests vary in size, shape, material used, and construction techniques from species to species. Materials used for building nests include fine leaf fibers, grass, and twigs. Many species weave very fine nests using thin strands of leaf fiber, though some, like the buffalo-weavers, form massive untidy stick nests in their colonies, which may have spherical woven nests within. The sociable weavers of Africa build apartment-house nests, in which 100 to 300 pairs have separate flask-shaped chambers entered by tubes at the bottom. The sparrow weavers live in family units that employ cooperative breeding.
Most species weave nests that have narrow entrances, facing downward.

Many weaver species are gregarious and breed colonially. The birds build their nests together for protection, often several to a branch. Usually the male birds weave the nests and use them as a form of display to lure prospective females.

==Relationship to humans==
They sometimes cause crop damage, notably the red-billed quelea, reputed to be the world&#x27;s most numerous bird.

<text>Marcel Deprez (12 December 1843 ‚Äì 13 October 1918) was a French electrical engineer. He was born in Aillant-sur-Milleron. He died in Vincennes.

==Biography==
Deprez was born in Aillant-sur-Milleron in rural France and attended the School of Mines in Paris. He was not able to complete the course; however, he must have made a good impression, as he was employed as a secretary to the director of the school, Charles Combes.

At Creil, from 1876 to 1886, Deprez conducted the first experiments to transmit electrical power over long distances. At the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris, in 1881, Deprez undertook the task of presenting an electricity distribution system based on the long-distance transmission of direct current. The first successful attempt took place in 1882 from Miesbach to Munich at the occasion of the Exposition of Electricity in the Glaspalast organised by Oskar von Miller. There he transmitted 1.5¬†kW at 2 kV over a distance of 35 miles.

Deprez conducted experiments in La Chapelle, Grenoble, Vizille, Paris, and Creil. He eventually attained transmission over thirty-five miles for industrial purposes. In 1889, Ren√© Thury continued his approach of arranging generators in series, eventually developing commercial systems delivering 20 megawatts at 125 kV over 230 kilometers.
