<text>Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) is a magnetic tape sound recording format introduced by Philips and Matsushita Electric in late 1992 and marketed as the successor to the standard analog Compact Cassette. It was also a direct competitor to Sony&#x27;s MiniDisc (MD), but neither format toppled the then-ubiquitous analog cassette despite their technical superiority, and DCC was discontinued in October 1996. Another competing format, the Digital Audio Tape (DAT), had by 1992 also failed to sell in large quantities to consumers, although it was popular as a professional digital audio storage format.

The DCC form factor is similar to the analog compact cassette (CC), and DCC recorders and players can play back either type: analog as well as DCC. This backward compatibility was intended to allow users to adopt digital recording without rendering their existing tape collections obsolete, but because DCC recorders couldn&#x27;t record (only play back) analog cassettes, it effectively forced consumers to either replace their cassette deck with a DCC recorder and give up analog recording, or keep the existing cassette deck and make space to add the DCC recorder to their setup.

== History ==
DCC signaled the parting of ways of Philips and Sony, who had previously worked together successfully on the audio CD, CD-ROM, and CD-i. The companies had also worked together on the Digital Audio Tape which was successful in professional environments, but was perceived as too expensive and fragile for consumers. Furthermore, the recording industry had been fighting against digital recording in court, resulting in the Audio Home Recording Act and SCMS.

Philips had developed the Compact Cassette in 1963 and allowed companies to use the format royalty-free, which made it hugely successful but not a significant money-maker. The company saw a market for a digital version of the cassette, and expected that the product would be popular if it could be made compatible with the analog cassette. 

Around 1988, Philips participated in the Eureka 147 project that eventually produced the DAB standard. For this, it cooperated with the Institute for Perception Research of the Eindhoven University of Technology to create the PASC compression algorithm based on psychoacoustics. 

On 8 October 1990, Philips made the first formal announcement of DCC. Tandy Corporation announced at the same time that it would help Philips with the development and distribution through its Tandy and RadioShack stores. It was expected at the time that DCC recorders would be available in the beginning of 1992 and would cost several hundred dollars less than DAT recorders. Even though this first announcement already used the term &quot;digital compact cassette&quot; (without capitalization), some publications around this time also referred to it as &quot;S-DAT&quot; (&quot;Stationary-Head Digital Audio Tape&quot;), to distinguish it from &quot;R-DAT&quot; (&quot;Rotary-Head Digital Audio Tape&quot;).

On 5 July 1991, Philips announced that Matsushita had joined forces with them to develop DCC. 

The first DCC recorders were introduced at the CES in Chicago in May 1992 and at the Firato consumer electronics show in Amsterdam in September 1992. At that time, not only Philips and Technics (brand of Matsushita) announced DCC recorders but also other brands such as Grundig and Marantz (both related to Philips at the time). Around the same time, Sony introduced the MiniDisc.

More recorders and players were introduced by Philips and other manufacturers in the following years, including some portable players and recorders as well as in-dash DCC/radio combinations for automotive use.

At the &quot;HCC-dagen&quot; computer fair in Utrecht, Netherlands, between 24 and 26 November 1995, Philips presented the DCC-175 portable recorder that can be connected to an IBM-compatible PC using the &quot;PC-link&quot; cable. This was the only DCC recorder that can be connected to, and controlled by a computer, and it was only ever available in the Netherlands.

Philips marketed the DCC format mostly in Europe, the United States, and Japan. According to the newspaper article that announced the demise of DCC, DCC was more popular than MiniDisc in Europe (especially in the Netherlands).

DCC was quietly discontinued in October 1996 after Philips admitted it had failed at achieving any significant market penetration with the format, and unofficially conceded victory to Sony. However, the MiniDisc format had not done very well either; the price of both systems had been too high for the younger market, while audiophiles rejected MD and DCC because in their opinion, the lossy compression degraded the audio quality too much.

== Technology ==
=== Magneto-resistive stationary heads ===

Unlike helical scan systems such as DAT or VHS, the head is stationary and the tape moves in linear direction relative to the head. Like analog audio tapes, the heads use half of the tape width in each direction. There are 9 tracks per side: eight tracks for the audio, and one track for auxiliary information. The track pitch is 195 μm. The head assembly has what Philips called &quot;Fixed Azimuth Tape Guidance&quot; (FATG) pins, which work together with the &quot;Azimuth Locking Pins System&quot; (ALPS) in the cassette to guide the tape.

DCC used magneto-resistive (MR) heads 70 μm wide for playback, and miniaturized coils 185 μm wide for recording. The heads were produced using photolithography. Some DCC head assemblies had separate MR heads to play analog tapes, others re-used two DCC heads to pick up the left and right analog audio tracks from the tape.

All DCC players and recorders are auto-reverse, so every player and recorder must have a way to position the heads for the A-side as well as the B-side of the tape. In stationary recorders, the mechanism switched sides by pivoting the head assembly 180 degrees (Philips used a modified version of an analog auto-reverse cassette deck during development, on which this mechanism was based), but in portable recorders and players, the head assemblies had heads for the tracks on both sides, which saved space in the mechanism, but made the head assembly more complicated:

* Pivoting head mechanisms in stationary recorders such as the DCC-900 used a head assembly that had 9 (MR) playback heads and 9 (coil) recording heads for DCC, plus two (MR) heads for playing analog compact cassettes. The head assembly was mounted on a pivoting mechanism that rotated the head assembly by 180 degrees when it switched from one side of the tape to the other.
* Playback-only portable players such as the DCC-130 and DCC-134 used head assemblies with 18 MR heads, nine for each side of the tape. When playing analog cassettes, two of the DCC MR heads were used to pick up the analog audio.
* Portable recorders such as the DCC-170 and DCC-175 used head assemblies with 18 MR heads for DCC playback, 18 coil heads for DCC recording, and 4 MR heads for analog playback (a total of 40 heads in one head assembly).

Magneto-resistive heads do not use iron so they do not build up residual magnetism. They never need to be demagnetized, and if a magnetic field from e.g. a cassette demagnetizer is applied to MR heads, it induces so much current into the heads that they are damaged or destroyed. Also, it is recommended never to use a cleaning cassette as DCC heads are fragile and this operation could ruin them permanently.

=== Tape specifications and PASC audio compression ===

DCC tape is the same width as in analog compact cassettes, and operates at the same speed: per second. The tape that was used in production cassettes was chromium dioxide- or cobalt-doped ferric oxide, 3–4 μm thick in a total tape thickness of 12 μm, identical to the tape that was widely in use for video tapes.

Nine heads are used to read/write half the width of the tape; the other half of the width are used for the B-side. Eight of these tracks contain audio data, the ninth track is used for auxiliary information such as song titles and track markers, as well as markers to make the player switch from side A to side B (with or without winding towards the end of the tape first) and end-of-tape markers.

The (theoretical) maximum capacity of a DCC tape is 120 minutes, compared to 3 hours for DAT; however, no 120-minute tapes were ever produced. Also, because of the time needed for the mechanism to switch direction, there is always a short interruption in the audio between the two sides of the tape. DCC recorders could record from digital sources that used the S/PDIF standard, at sample rates of 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz, or they could record from analog sources at 44.1 kHz.

Because of the low tape speed, the achievable bit rate of DCC is limited. To compensate, DCC uses Precision Adaptive Sub-band Coding (PASC) for audio data compression. PASC was later integrated into the ISO/IEC 11172-3 standard as MPEG-1 Audio Layer I (MP1). Though MP1 allows various bit rates, PASC is fixed at 384 kilobits per second. The bandwidth of a CD recording of approximately 1.4 megabits per second is reduced to 384 kilobits per second, a compression ratio of around 3.68:1. The difference in quality between PASC and the 5:1 compression used by early versions of ATRAC in the original MiniDisc is largely a subjective matter.

After adding system information (such as emphasis settings, SCMS information, and time code) as well as adding Reed-Solomon error correction bits to the 384 kbit/s data stream, followed by 8b/10b encoding, the resulting bit rate on the eight main data tracks tape ends up being twice the rate of the original PASC data: 768 kbit/s, which is recorded onto the eight main data tracks at 96 kbit/s per track in an interleaved pattern. According to the Philips webpage, it is possible for a DCC player to recover all missing data from a tape, even if one of the 8 audio tracks is completely unreadable, or if all tracks are unreadable for 1.45 mm (about 0.03 seconds).

=== Auxiliary track ===

On prerecorded tapes, the information about album artist, album title, and track titles and lengths is recorded on the auxiliary ninth track continuously for the length of the entire tape. This makes it possible for players to recognize immediately what the tape position is and how to get to any of the other tracks (including which side of the tape to turn to), as soon as a tape was inserted and playback was started, regardless of whether the tape was rewound before inserting or not.

On user tapes, a track marker was recorded at the beginning of every track, so that it was possible to skip and repeat tracks automatically. The markers were automatically recorded when a silence was detected during an analog recording, or when a track marker was received in the S/PDIF signal of a digital input source (this track marker is automatically generated by CD players). It was possible to remove these markers (to &quot;merge tracks&quot;), or add extra markers (to &quot;split tracks&quot;) without rerecording the audio. Furthermore, it was possible to add markers afterwards that would signal the end of the tape or the end of the tape side, so that during playback, the player would stop the mechanism, fast-forward to the end of the A-side, or switch from the A-side to the B-side immediately.

On later generations of recorders, it was possible to enter title information for each track, which was recorded on the auxiliary track after the start-of-track marker. Because the title information was only stored in one place (unlike prerecorded tapes where users could see the names of all tracks on a tape) it was not possible to see tracks names of any other track than the one that is currently playing.

There are some minor compatibility problems with user-recorded titles; for example:
* On stationary recorders that had simple fourteen-segment displays, all track information had to be converted to upper-case because on those displays, showing lower-case characters is impossible. They were capable of displaying symbols that are impossible to enter with their own track information editors (such as the apostrophe).
* The Philips DCC-822/DCC-824 car stereo with DCC player had a full dot-matrix text display which could display upper-case and lower-case characters on prerecorded tapes as well as user-recorded tapes.
* Later-generation portable recorders DCC-170 and DCC-175 were capable of displaying text information from prerecorded tapes, but not from user-recorded tapes. The DCC-175 was capable of writing and reading the text information to/from a super-user tape via the PC, but does not show the user-recorded text information on the display.

=== &quot;User tapes&quot; and &quot;super user tapes&quot; ===

Some Philips documentation distinguishes between &quot;user tapes&quot; and &quot;super user tapes&quot;. Super user tapes are tapes that have a continuously recorded stream of audio, with continuous absolute time codes relative to the start of the tape, and contiguously numbered tracks. In contrast, non-super user tapes may have one or more section that has no absolute time code and tracks that are unnumbered. The Renumber button that makes the recorder find all the track markers on a tape and makes sure that all track numbers are contiguous (which might not be the case if the user splits or merges tracks), only works on super-user tapes.
Other than absolute time codes and track numbers that may become discontinuous or unavailable on a non-super user tape, it&#x27;s impossible to distinguish between user tapes and super user tapes.

To make sure that the absolute time codes remain continuous (and the tape remains a super user tape), the user should start every recording at a point where absolute time codes are available. Some recorders have an APPEND button to find the end of the last recording automatically and prepare the recorder for the next recording. When recording mode is engaged (with or without the APPEND function), the electronics actually read the tape for a fraction of a second, to synchronize the internal absolute time counter with the time recorded on tape, and then start the actual recording at the beginning of a tape frame so that the resulting data stream has a continuous absolute time code.

=== Copy protection ===

All DCC recorders used the SCMS copy-protection system, which uses two bits in the S/PDIF digital audio stream and on tape to differentiate between protected vs. unprotected audio, and between original vs. copy:

* Recording digitally from a source marked &quot;protected&quot; and &quot;original&quot; (produced by a prerecorded DCC or Minidisc, for example) was allowed, but the recorder will change the &quot;original&quot; bit to the &quot;copy&quot; state on the new tape to prevent copying of the copy. CDs do not have SCMS bits as the format predates this system. However, the recorder treats the absence of SCMS bits as &quot;protected&quot; and &quot;original&quot;. Consequently the DCC recording cannot be further copied.
* Recording digitally from a source marked &quot;unprotected&quot; is also allowed; the &quot;original/copy&quot; marker is ignored. The &quot;unprotected&quot; bit is preserved in the copy.
* Recording digitally from a source marked &quot;protected&quot; and &quot;copy&quot; is not allowed: the record button will not work and any ongoing recordings will stop, and an error message is shown on the display.

Analog recording was not restricted: tapes recorded from analog source were marked &quot;unprotected&quot;. The only limitation to analog recording on DCC as compared to that on DAT recorders is that the A/D converter was fixed to a sample frequency of 44.1 kHz. On the DCC-175 portable recorder it was possible to circumvent the SCMS protection by copying audio to the hard disk and then back to another tape, using the DCC Studio program.

=== Cassettes and cases ===

The DCC cassette and the case that Philips (but not some other cassette manufacturers) used were designed by Peter Doodson who also designed the CD jewel case.
DCCs are similar to analog compact cassettes, except that there are no &quot;bulges&quot; where the tape-access holes are located. DCC cassettes are flat and there are no access holes for the hubs on the top side (they are not required because auto-reverse is a standard feature on all DCC decks), so this side can be used for a larger label than can be used on an analog compact cassette. A spring-loaded metal shutter similar to the shutters on 3.5 inch floppy disks and MiniDiscs covers the tape access holes and locks the hubs while the cassette is not in use. Cassettes provide several extra holes and indentations so that DCC recorders can tell a DCC apart from an analog compact cassette, and so they can tell what the length of a DCC tape is. Also, there is a sliding write-protect tab on the DCC to enable and disable recording. Unlike the break-away notches on analog compact cassettes and VHS tapes, this tab makes it easier to make a tape recordable again, and unlike on analog compact cassettes, the marker protects the entire tape rather than just one side.

The cases that DCCs came in generally did not have the characteristic folding mechanism used for analog compact cassettes. Instead, DCC cases tended to be simple plastic boxes that were open on one of the short sides. The front side had a rectangular opening that exposed almost the entire cassette, so that any label on the cassette would be visible even when the cassette was in its case. This allowed the user to slide the cassette into and out of the case with one hand (which was seen as a major advantage for mobile use), and reduced production costs, especially for prerecorded cassettes, because the case did not need a separate label. Format partner Matsushita (now Panasonic) and others did, however, produce blank cassettes (under their Panasonic brand) with a clam-shell-style case. Because DCCs have no &quot;bulges&quot; near the tape access holes, there is more space in the case behind the cassette to insert, for example, a booklet for a prerecorded tape, or a folded up card on which users could write the contents of the tape. In spite of the differences, the outside measurements of the standard DCC cases were exactly identical to the cases of analog compact cassettes, so they could be used in existing storage systems. The Matsushita-designed clam-shell case was slightly thinner than an analog compact cassette case is.

=== Data recording ===

There is only one DCC recorder that has the capability of being connected to and controlled by a computer: the DCC-175. It is a portable recorder that was developed by Marantz in Japan (unlike most of the other Philips recorders which were developed in the Netherlands and Belgium), and looks very similar to the other portables available from Philips and Marantz at the time: the DCC-134 and the DCC-170. The DCC-175 was sold only in the Netherlands, and was available separately or in a package with the &quot;PC-link&quot; data cable which can be used to connect the recorder to a parallel port of an IBM-compatible PC. Only small quantities of both recorder and cable were made, leaving many people searching for one or both at the time of the demise of DCC.

The DCC-175 Service Manual shows that in the recorder, the cable is connected to the I²S bus that carries the PASC bitstream, and it is also connected to a dedicated serial port of the microcontroller, to allow the PC to control the mechanism and to read and write auxiliary information such as track markers and track titles. The parallel port connector of the cable contains a custom chip created especially for this purpose by Philips Key Modules, as well as a standard RAM chip. Philips made no detailed technical information available to the public about the custom chip and therefore it is impossible for people who own a DCC-175 but no PC-link cable to make their own version of the PC-link cable.

The PC-link cable package included software consisting of:

* DCC Backup for Windows, a backup program
* DCC Studio, a sound recorder and editor for Windows
* A DCC tape database program that works together with DCC Studio

Philips also provided a DOS backup application via their BBS, and later on they provided an upgrade to the DCC Studio software to fix some bugs and provide better compatibility with Windows 95 which had come out just before the release of the DCC-175. The software also works with Windows 98, Windows 98SE and Windows ME, but not with any later versions of Windows.

The backup programs for DOS as well as Windows does not support long file names which had been introduced by Windows 95 just a few months before the release. Also, because the tape runs at its usual speed and data rate, it takes 90 minutes to record approximately 250 megabytes of uncompressed data. Other backup media common in those days were faster, had more capacity, and supported long file names, so the DCC backup programs were relatively unhelpful for users.

The DCC Studio application, however, was a useful application that made it possible to copy audio from tape to hard disk and vice versa, regardless of the SCMS status of the tape. This made it possible to circumvent SCMS with DCC Studio. The program also allowed users to manipulate the PASC audio files that were recorded to hard disk in various ways: they could change equalization settings, cut/copy and paste track fragments, and place and move audio markers and name those audio markers from the PC keyboard. It was possible to record a mix tape by selecting the desired tracks from a list, and moving the tracks around in a playlist. Then the user could click on the record button to copy the entire playlist back to DCC tape, while simultaneously recording markers (such as reverse and end-of-tape) and track titles. It was not necessary to record the track titles and tape markers separately (as you would do with a stationary recorder), and thanks to the use of a PC keyboard, it was possible to use characters in song titles that were not available when using a stationary machine&#x27;s remote control.

The DCC Studio program used the recorder as playback and recording device, avoiding the need for a separate sound card, an uncommon accessory at the time. Working with the PASC data directly without the need to compress and decompress, also saved a lot of hard disk space, and most computers at the time would have had a hard time compressing and decompressing PASC data in real time anyway. However, many users complained that they would have liked to have the possibility of using uncompressed WAV audio files with the DCC Studio program, and Philips responded by mailing a floppy disk to registered users, containing programs to convert a WAV file to PASC and vice versa. Unfortunately this software was extremely slow (it takes several hours to compress a few minutes of PCM music in a WAV file to PASC) but it was soon discovered that the PASC files are simply MPEG-1 Audio Layer I files that use an under-documented padding feature of the MPEG standard to make all frames the same length, so then it became easy to use other MPEG decoding software to convert PASC to PCM and vice versa.

== Derivatives ==

The technology of using stationary MR heads was later further developed by OnStream for use as a data storage media for computers. MR heads are now also commonly used in hard disks, although hard disks now use the giant magnetoresistance variant, whereas DCCs used the earlier anisotropic magnetoresistance.

A derivative technology developed originally for DCC is now being used for filtering beer. Silicon wafers with micrometer-scale holes are ideal for separating yeast particles from beer, as the beer flows through the silicon wafer leaving the yeast particles behind. This is desirable when the final beer is meant to be extremely clear. The manufacturing process for the filters was originally developed for the read/write heads of DCC decks.

<text>Vanessa atalanta, the red admiral or, previously, the red admirable, is a well-characterized, medium-sized butterfly with black wings, red bands, and white spots. It has a wingspan of about . It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The red admiral is widely distributed across temperate regions of North Africa, the Americas, Europe, Asia, and the Caribbean. It resides in warmer areas, but migrates north in spring and sometimes again in autumn. Typically found in moist woodlands, the red admiral caterpillar&#x27;s primary host plant is the stinging nettle (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;); it can also be found on the false nettle (&quot;Boehmeria cylindrica&quot;). The adult butterfly drinks from flowering plants like &quot;Buddleia&quot; and overripe fruit. Red admirals are territorial; females will only mate with males that hold territory. Males with superior flight abilities are more likely to successfully court females. It is known as an unusually calm butterfly, often allowing observation at a very close distance before flying away, also landing on and using humans as perches.

==Geographic range==
The red admiral is found in temperate regions of North Africa, North and Central America, Europe, Asia, and island regions of Hawaii, and the Caribbean.

==Description==
The forewing of this butterfly bears on a black ground an oblique vermilion band and a group of white subapical spots. On the hindwing the larger portion of the distal margin is red, with a row of small black spots and at the anal angle an elongate blue spot. The underside is partly variegated with blue; the forewing is on the whole similar in markings to the upper, while the hindwing is brightly variegated and clouded, bearing black markings, of which those in the cell resemble a figure (on the left wing 18 or 98, on the right 81 or 89); in the middle of the costal area there is a pale patch and in the distal marginal area a row of ocellus-like spots. Sometimes, especially in the female, the red band of the forewing bears
a small white spot in the middle.

==Biology==

In northern Europe, it is one of the last butterflies to be seen before winter sets in, often feeding on the flowers of ivy on sunny days. The red admiral is also known to hibernate, re-emerging individuals showing prominently darker colors than the first brood. The butterfly also flies on sunny winter days, especially in southern Europe.

In North America, the red admiral generally has two broods from March through October. Most of North America must be recolonized each spring by southern migrants, but the species overwinters in south Texas.

==Life cycle==
===Larval and pupal stages===
Red admiral larvae measure approximately in length. Their coloration is variable, but they are usually black with white spots and spines. These spines persist into the pupal phase.

In laboratory tests where larvae were reared at various constant temperatures, a difference in pupal period and coloration was found. At higher temperatures, around 32 degrees Celsius (90 °F), the pupal period of the red admiral is 6 days. At 11 to 18 degrees Celsius (51 to 64 °F) this period increases to 18 to 50 days. At even lower temperatures around 7 degrees Celsius (45 °F), the pupal period lasts between 47 and 82 days. The pupae are bright scarlet at high temperatures and black with a smaller scarlet area at low temperatures. This differential coloration at various temperatures may explain why the summer form of the red admiral is brighter and more heavily pigmented than the winter form.

The primary host plant for the red admiral is the stinging nettle (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;), but it can also be found on the false nettle (&quot;Boehmeria cylindrica&quot;), Pennsylvania pellitory (&quot;Parietaria&quot;) and other species within Urticaceae. Certain plants of the families Compositae and Cannabaceae may also be used as hosts.

===Adult stage===
The red admiral is identified by its striking black, orange, and white wing pattern. On the dorsal side, its dark wings possess orange bands on the middle of the forewings and the outer edge of the hindwings. The distal ends of the forewings contain white spots. The ventral side of the wings are brown with patches of red, white, and black. The hindwings have a brown marbled pattern. The red admiral has summer and winter morphs. Summer red admirals are larger and more pigmented than winter morphs. The wingspan ranges from .
==Territoriality==
Male red admirals are territorial and perch during the afternoon until sunset. Larger territories are optimal and subject to intrusion by other males more frequently than smaller territories. Territories tend to be oval, long and wide. Males patrol their territory by flying around the perimeter between 7 and 30 times per hour. On average, territory holders interact with intruders 10 to 15 times per hour.

When another male encroaches on a red admiral&#x27;s territory, the resident chases away the intruder, often in a vertical, helical path to disorient or tire out the intruder while minimizing the horizontal distance it travels from its perch. The red admiral immediately returns to its territory after chasing off encroaching males. Time spent patrolling increases as number of the intruder interactions increases.

Patrolling behavior is correlated with warmer air temperatures, so males begin patrolling early and continue later on warmer days. Overcast skies usually led to patrolling later in the day. It is not clear whether this later start time is due to lower air temperature or a direct effect of decreased solar radiation. Another theory is that males believe it is earlier in the morning on cloudy days because of the reduced solar radiation.

==Mating==
Male red admirals court females for several hours before they begin mating. Because of female choice, only males with territory have the opportunity to mate. Females select males with traits that will increase the mating success of their offspring. In order to maintain their territory, males fly around and patrol the area 7 to 30 times per hour. Only males of exceptional flying ability are able to chase off intruding males and successfully court females.
==Migration==
Mating usually occurs in late autumn or early winter following collective migration to southern regions with a warmer climate. The red admiral&#x27;s main host plant, stinging nettle, is most abundant during this migration. Larval development proceeds through winter and adults are first sighted in early spring. The new generation of adults migrates north before mating, because food is usually diminished by late spring. In Europe, the cyclic nature of this migration has been confirmed by analysing stable isotopes of wing samples. In spring, individuals arriving at northern Europe (Kaliningrad) were of a southern origin, while in autumn the isotope analyses revealed that samples came from the surrounding area or northern latitudes. During migration, the red admiral flies at high altitudes where high-speed winds carry the butterfly, reducing energy expenditure.

==Physiology==
===Vision===
Red admirals have color vision in the 440–590 nm range of the visible spectrum which includes indigo, blue, green, and yellow. They have compound eyes with a transparent, crystalline structure called a rhabdom which is similar in function to a human retina. These butterflies do not have the specific lateral filtering pigments coating their rhabdom found in some other nymphalid butterflies that likely evolved later. A consequence of this lack of pigment is that the red admiral cannot differentiate between colors in the 590–640 nm range, which includes orange and red. In species such as the monarch butterfly that express these lateral filtering pigments, higher wavelengths of light are altered, so they can excite the sensory photopigments. This physiological difference between butterfly species provides insight into the evolutionary adaptation of color vision.

==Conservation==
===Climate change===
Spring temperatures in central England between 1976 and 1998 increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius and summer temperatures increased by 1 degree Celsius. Following this 22-year period of warming, the red admiral appeared six weeks earlier in the year. Of 35 species of butterflies studied in central England, the change in the duration of flight period was most significant in the red admiral, exhibiting a 39.8 day increase. These changes in migration time and length could result in an increased abundance of red admirals and a northward range expansion. Warmer climates could lead to an increase in time spent finding mates, laying eggs, and collecting nectar. Conversely, more frequent droughts associated with climate change would decrease egg survival and lead to habitat and host plant destruction.

==In popular culture==
The red admiral features in several works of Vladimir Nabokov: &quot;Speak, Memory&quot; (1951), &quot;Pale Fire&quot; (1962), and &quot;King, Queen, Knave&quot; (1968).

<text>Moscow Domodedovo International Airport () (IATA: DME, ICAO: UUDD), formally Domodedovo Mikhail Lomonosov International Airport, is an international airport serving Moscow, the capital of Russia. It is located in Domodedovo, Moscow Oblast, south-southeast from the city centre of Moscow. Domodedovo Airport serves regular flights across Russia, as well as to Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and it is the third largest airport in Russia and the CIS after Sheremetyevo and Pulkovo. Domodedovo Airport is among the top twenty busiest airports in Europe. In 2022, the airport served 21.2 million passengers.

In 2019, following a naming contest and a presidential decree, the airport was renamed after Russian scientist Mikhail Lomonosov.

==History==

The airport is named after the town of Domodedovo, on the territory of which it is located.

Survey work on the construction of the new Capital Airport began in 1948, after a decision by the Politburo. It was then described as special &quot;Facility No. 306&quot;.

The Domodedovo Airport is on the former territory of a village called Elgazino (). The village&#x27;s wrecked wooden houses (Izba) at and cemetery with 19th century tombstones at remained in the early 21st century, less than a kilometer west of the runway, almost immediately behind the fences. The first mention of Elgazino dates back to the 16th century. In 1550, Tsar Ivan the Terrible gave his voivode and boyar Ivan Vasilyevich Sheremetyev a smaller estate in the Moscow district with 150 quarters of land. In 1627, the village appears again in the records and appears as a village of Elgozino on a pond with five peasant households, in the parish of the Church of the Resurrection in the village of Kolychevo. According to the results of the General Survey of the 1760s, the village already had 25 households and 218 inhabitants. In the 1950s, just before the village was demolished, it had a population of about 200 people.

In 1951, preparatory work on construction began: cutting firebreaks, and construction of access roads, including roads from Paveletskaya.

A 1954 Resolution of the Council of Ministers of 13 November approved the proposal of the Main Directorate of the Civil Air Fleet under the Council of Ministers of the USSR on the construction of the second airport of the Moscow civil air fleet near the village Elgazino Podolsky (now Domodedovo) Moscow Oblast.

In 1958, a decree of the USSR Council of Ministers enabled completion of construction of the first stage of the airport in 1962.

In 1962, an Order of the Head of Main Directorate of Civil Aviation, issued on 7 April No. 200 (&quot;On the organization of the Moscow Domodedovo airport&quot;) ordered &quot;organize as part of the Moscow Transport Aviation Management Directorate the new airport, and continue to call it the Moscow Domodedovo Airport&quot;. Therefore, 7 April 1962 is considered the official birthday of the airport. By the end of 1962, after the official approbation, the airport began flights by postal and cargo planes.

Services from Domodedovo began in March 1964 with a flight to Sverdlovsk using a Tupolev 104. The airport, intended to handle the growth of long-distance domestic traffic in the Soviet Union, was officially opened in May 1965. A second runway, parallel to the existing one, entered service eighteen months after the opening of the airport. On 26 December 1975, Domodedovo Airport was selected for the inaugural flight of the Tupolev Tu-144 to Alma Ata.

In 1990s, the airport was privatized and came under the control of the private tourist company (later also an airline) East Line founded by Ural entrepreneurs Anton Bakov and Dmitry Kamenshchik. In 1992, their efforts led to the airport obtaining international status (Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation dated 13 July 1992 N 1262-r On the opening of Domodedovo Airport (Moscow) for international flights. Bakov left the business in 1994, and Kamenshchik still heads the company.

The reconstruction of the airport terminal complex began in 1999 as part of the Comprehensive Airport Development Program until 2003, which was approved by the Government of the Moscow Region and the Board of the Federal Air Transport Service of the Russian Federation. According that Program almost complete reconstruction of the airport terminal complex took place, which opened in 2000. The airport do not stop operations during period of construction.

In 2000, as a result of reconstruction, the capacity of the airport complex reached 6,000 passengers per hour: IAL – 2800 passengers per hour, DAL – 3,200 passengers per hour. As a result of this work Domodedovo airport terminal was the first in Russia to successfully pass the certification to ISO 9001:2000.

In 2003, the authoritative British magazine &quot;Airline Business&quot; recognized the growth in Domodedovo&#x27;s passenger traffic as one of the highest among the 150 largest airports in the world. In 2004, the airport was among the hundred leading airports in the world, and by 2005 became the leader in passenger traffic in the Moscow aviation area, a record it held for the next ten years.

By 2009, the terminal floor space was expanded to from in 2004. The renovated terminal and airport facilities allowed the owners of the airport to attract British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, Lufthansa, Royal Air Maroc, Japan Airlines, Austrian Airlines, and Vietnam Airlines who moved their flights from another major international Moscow airport, Sheremetyevo Airport, to Domodedovo. Domodedovo topped Sheremetyevo Airport in terms of passenger traffic becoming the busiest airport in Russia. By 2010, the traffic at Domodedovo rose to over 22 million passengers per year from 2.8 million in 2000.

Domodedovo is Russia&#x27;s first airport to have parallel runways operating simultaneously. Since the air traffic control tower was redeveloped in 2003, Domodedovo can control over seventy takeoffs and landings per hour. By late in the first decade of the 21st century, the airport had five business lounges set up by individual airlines.

In 2003, the airport began an expansion program designed to obtain approval for wide-body aircraft operations. The runway, taxiways, and parking areas were enlarged and strengthened. In March 2009, it was announced that the approval had been granted, making Domodedovo Airport the first airport in Russia approved for new large aircraft (NLA) operations such as the Airbus A380. The approval signifies that its operations areas comply with size and strength requirements of ICAO Category F standards. The airport has ILS category III A status.

Domodedovo Airport has been the focus of two terrorist-related incidents. In 2004, Muslim suicide bombers managed to pass airport security, board two passenger planes, and carry out the bombings after departure from Domodedovo. Despite the heightened security measures taken after this incident, another suicide bomber attack occurred on 24 January 2011, when an Islamist militant entered the terminal building and detonated a bomb in the arrival hall. As a result, mandatory screening and pat-down practices have been introduced at the airport terminal entrances.
In 2011 during the run-up for the IPO the holding company published information about the final beneficiary at the London Stock Exchange website and specified Kamenshchik as its sole owner. Domodedovo Airport is the only private airport in Russia: the airport operator is DME Limited Group.

==Future development==
As of January 2016, new concourse extensions adjacent to the current terminal building are under construction. The construction is projected to increase the overall size of the passenger terminal to . The extensions opened in stages in 2012–2014. In May 2015, the new extension of terminal A (the main building) was finished, which contains new offices, an airport lounge and new passport control desks, and its design differs from other terminal parts. All concourses will remain connected and plan to increase the efficiency of the airport operations and passenger connections by using ICAO and IATA transfer technologies. A new parking space was also finished, which can accommodate over 1500 cars.

==Airport facilities==

===Terminals===

The project is implemented within the framework of the architectural concept UNDER ONE ROOF: a single terminal allows the most efficient use of the transfer potential of the airport complex. The number of jetways increased to 40, including dual ones for servicing large-capacity aircraft, after the opening of the new segment of the passenger terminal (T2).

===Terminal 2===
The first stage of Terminal 2 was built as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup program, for international flights. When completed, the international flights operated at concourse B were all shifted to the new segment, which became the second segment of a new passenger terminal and is twice the size of Terminal 5 at London Heathrow – the equivalent of 61 football fields. An area of (segment T2) was mounted to the left wing of the existing terminal. There are about 100 check-in counters, 40 self check-in kiosks, as well as special jetways for the world&#x27;s largest passenger aircraft, Airbus A380. As a result, the total area of the passenger terminal (including the expansion of the current main segment T1) was more than doubled to nearly . It was designed by the British company RMJM and uses the under-the-roof concept, which means that passengers from all flights will be serviced within a single terminal. One of Europe&#x27;s largest air hubs – Amsterdam Airport Schiphol – operates under this concept. The construction was initially planned to be finished by March 2018, however, due to immediate changes in contractor, the construction was delayed significantly. During 2018, terminal staff worked only in specific arrival and departure zones for football fans, travelling with special fan-centered passports. The terminal was fully completed with all remaining parts left for work, in 2020.

Moscow Domodedovo Airport has commissioned a new segment of the passenger terminal – T2, increasing the area of the air harbor to almost . The total capacity of the airport will exceed 60 million passengers per year. The new segment is 7 floors with a total area of about .

===Terminal 3 and Aeroexpress Terminal===
In 2021 a new Aeroexpress terminal was opened, connected by a covered walkway to the airport terminal building.

===Hotel===
In September 2017, a new hotel was opened inside the airport terminal (&quot;Aerotel Express&quot;). This allows passengers transiting through Moscow to stay at a hotel without exiting the terminal (previously transit passengers had to leave the terminal and use a shuttle van to access the nearest hotel). This was the first hotel inside an airport terminal in Russia.

===Lounges===
Business lounges are available to business class passengers, participants of airline bonus programs and passengers, regardless of the class of the air ticket, who pay for the service in cash.

In 2023 the Horizon lounge opened in the new segment of the passenger terminal (T2) – a lounge-waiting area, a buffet, a coworking area, a shower room and a playroom for children.

===Family Service===
The baby care room provides facilities for children aged 0 to 14 years. Family Service guests have access to playrooms, bedrooms and changing room, as well as a dining area with kitchen.

===DME MED===
The first in Russia consultative and diagnostic clinic based on the airport&#x27;s medical center is located in the new segment of the passenger terminal. The clinic offers a full range of laboratory tests, including genetic, as well as a wide range of functional, medical ultrasound, cosmetology and psychological services.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, many countries have moved to ban Russian airlines from their air space and many countries ban airlines from flying in and out of Russian airspace. Other airlines from the European Union, North America, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore have indefinitely suspended their services to Domodedovo.

The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter services to and from Domodedovo:

==Statistics==

===Annual traffic===

==Other facilities==
* Russian Sky Airlines had its head office on the airport property.
* Transaero had its head office at Domodedovo Airport.
* When Domodedovo Airlines existed, its head office was on the airport property.

==Ground transportation==
===Rail===

The airport has a railway station with service to the Paveletsky Rail Terminal in central Moscow. The rail connection, which was completed in 2002, provides Aeroexpress trains (takes 45 min; coach class costs 500 rubles, business class costs 1,000 rubles), with two stops at Paveletsky Rail Terminal and Verkhnie Kotly railway station. 
Regular suburban commuter trains in the Paveletsky suburban railway line take 65 to 70 min and cost 198 rubles, but are infrequent during the day.

===Bus===
Connection to Moscow is served by bus 308, 1185 Aeroexpress and commercial marshrutka minivans (more frequent departures): to Domodedovskaya of Moscow Metro Zamoskvoretskaya Line (#2). The fare is 170 rubles (eq. to 1,9 US$), travel time around 45 minutes.

Local buses and marshrutkas 11, 26, 30, 17k, 30k, 47k, 52k link to nearby towns and connect to the railway station in the Paveletsky suburban railway line at Domodedovo municipality.

Bus 999 is south-east bound and connects the airport to Bronnitsy, Kolomna and Ryazan.

===Road===
The airport has several long and short term parking lots. The terminal itself is accessed from the junction of Moscow Ring Road and Kashirskoye Highway via a designated 22 kilometer (14 mi) four-lane freeway. Passengers can use the services of a licensed taxi, popular mobile applications for ordering a car, as well as take a carsharing located in the parking P3.

<text>Fordingbridge is a town and broader civil parish with a population of 6,200 on the River Avon in the New Forest District of Hampshire, England. It is located near the Dorset and Wiltshire borders and on the edge of the New Forest. 

It is southwest of London, and south of the city of Salisbury. Fordingbridge is a former market town famed for its seven-arch late medieval bridge, which crosses the River Avon at the centre of the town. The Avon Valley Path passes through the town. 

Since 1982 Fordingbridge has been twinned with Vimoutiers in Normandy, France.

==Overview==

Known as &quot;The Northern Gateway&quot; to the New Forest, Fordingbridge is popular with tourists, with various campsites, pubs and restaurants, and other tourist facilities locally. The Fordingbridge Museum, which houses many local and New Forest history exhibits, and the Visitor Information Centre are located within King&#x27;s Yard, Salisbury Street. The town&#x27;s High Street is well known for its pubs, cafes and local shops. The town also has its own Cinema, within the buildings of an old pottery. Rockbourne Roman Villa is in the nearby village of Rockbourne which sits northwest of Fordingbridge. The village of Breamore is 3 miles north of Fordingbridge and is home to Elizabethan country house, Breamore House.

 The Great Bridge, from which the town received its present name, has seven arches and can be seen from the town&#x27;s large riverside park and recreation ground. The park contains a children&#x27;s play area, secluded memorial gardens, and large sports playing field. A bronze statue of the painter and former resident Augustus John stands on the banks of the Avon near the Great Bridge. 

St. Mary&#x27;s Church, which has some typical Norman characteristics, is located in the south of the town. The church has a memorial to James Alexander Seton, last British person killed in a duel in England. The town also has a Catholic church in the form of Our Lady of Sorrows and St Philip Benizi. The Building dates from 1874 while the altar dating from 1897 was originally used at Netley Hospital. 

Fordingbridge Hospital is a small community hospital built within the grounds of a Victorian workhouse. Most of the older buildings have been redeveloped into private housing, however, the hospital site still houses an inpatient ward, as well as limited outpatients services. Fordingbridge Doctors Surgery is on the same site in Bartons Road. Fordingbridge Hospital was used as a COVID-19 vaccination centre from 2020.

The local comprehensive school is The Burgate School and Sixth Form Centre, in Burgate, a small hamlet to the north of the town.

Fordingbridge is home to Fordingbridge Turks, one of the oldest football clubs in England, established circa 1868. The Turks name is believed to derive from wishing to emulate the determination shown by Ottoman forces at Siege of Plevna. Fordingbridge Turks FC play their matches at the recreation ground. &#x27;The Rec&#x27; is also home to Fordingbridge Rugby Club.

==Geography==
The parish of Fordingbridge contains the hamlets of Burgate to the north, Criddlestyle to the east, Bickton to the south, and Ashford to the west. Burgate and Bickton are settlements dating back to the time of the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, and Bickton was in male heads of households greater than Fordingbridge in 1086. Criddlestyle is an ancient manor, also known as East Mill, with a history dating back to the 14th century. The largest hamlet today is &quot;Ashford&quot;, which was the location of an ancient watermill, and was also the location of Fordingbridge railway station until it was closed in 1964. Also near to Fordingbridge is the hamlet of Tinkers Cross just over a mile (1.6 km) northwest of the town centre.

The villages of Sandleheath, Damerham, Rockbourne, Whitsbury, Breamore, Woodgreen, Godshill and Hyde all sit within a 5 mile radius of Fordingbridge and are all within the county of Hampshire. Alderholt is southwest of Fordingbridge and is part of Dorset.

Fordingbridge is north of Ringwood and Bournemouth, south of Downton and Salisbury which are all linked by the A338 road.

==History==
Fordingbridge is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 under the name &quot;Forde&quot;. The manor was held by a certain Robert from &quot;Robert the son of Gerald&quot;. Prior to 1066 it had been held by Alwy from King Edward. At the beginning of the 13th century Fordingbridge was held by Hugh de Linguire, who, dying around 1231, left a niece and heir Alice, wife of William de la Falaise. From that date Fordingbridge followed the same descent as Rowner.

The manor was held by Elias de la Falaise at his death in 1254, and his brother William died in possession of the manor in the same year. Before 1277 the property had escheated to the Crown by the felony of William de la Falaise, grandson of William, and was granted in that year to Sir William le Brune, chamberlain to the king. The manor then stayed solidly in the Brune family until the death of Charles Brune in 1769, when the family became extinct in the male line. By his will his estates eventually devolved onto his grand-nephew the Rev. Charles Prideaux-Brune of Prideaux Place, Padstow, Cornwall, and the manor then remained in the possession of the Prideaux-Brune family.

The lord of the manor had a market before 1273: it was held weekly first on Saturday and then on Friday until the middle of the 19th century, when it was discontinued. A fair was held on 9 September. From the 13th to the 15th century Fordingbridge was governed by a bailiff, and then in later centuries by a constable chosen yearly at the court leet of the manor of Lower Burgate. The constable was the chief officer until 1878, when government by Local District Council was established.

A fire in the town on 23 May 1702 destroyed 43 dwelling houses, which were never rebuilt. Fordingbridge Town Hall, built in 1877, is almost in the centre of the town.

Cloth was made here in the 16th century, and in the 19th century there were factories for the manufacture of sailcloth and canvas and the spinning of flax. By 1900 the chief industries of the town were the manufacture of sailcloth and canvas and the making of bricks and tiles, and there were various flour mills, an iron foundry, and the Neave&#x27;s food works.

Fordingbridge railway station was opened in 1866 but closed in 1964. It was originally just outside the town, on the road leading to Sandleheath. Today, the road is still called Station Road; however, the spot where the station once stood is now occupied by a large mill and industrial park. The site is next to the recently reopened &#x27;Railway Hotel&#x27;. The Station connected the town with Salisbury to the north and Poole to the south, as part of the Salisbury and Dorset Junction Railway.

==The Great Bridge==
The first bridge at Fordingbridge was built before 1252, when the bailiff and men of the town received a grant of pontage for one year towards its repairs. Several similar grants followed, the last being dated in 1452. The bridge is 40 metres long and consists of seven stone arches, and it is one of the two bridges with seven arches in the UK. The bridge brought much traffic through the town. At the east end of the bridge was a Saint John the Baptist Hospital (hospitalry) for poor travellers. It was founded 1272, and dissolved 1546; some foundation walls remain, but no other remains.

A custom which survived until 1840 obliged the lord of Fordingbridge during one summer month known as &quot;fence month&quot; to keep the bridge guarded and arrest anyone found taking venison from the New Forest. Significant alterations were made in 1841 when both sides were widened, adding 45 cm to the width of the bridge. The original arches are still visible, being smaller in span than the 19th-century additions. A reinforced concrete footpath on one side was added in 1901 to widen the bridge.

<text>The Amber Room (, ) was a chamber decorated in amber panels backed with gold leaf and mirrors, located in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg.

Constructed in the 18th century in Prussia, the room was dismantled and eventually disappeared during World War II. Before its loss, it was considered an &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;. A reconstruction was made, starting in 1979 and completed and installed in the Catherine Palace in 2003.

The Amber Room was intended in 1701 for the Charlottenburg Palace, in Berlin, Prussia, but was eventually installed at the Berlin City Palace. It was designed by German baroque sculptor Andreas Schlüter and Danish amber craftsman Gottfried Wolfram. Schlüter and Wolfram worked on the room until 1707, when work was continued by amber masters Gottfried Turau and Ernst Schacht from Danzig (Gdańsk).

It remained in Berlin until 1716, when it was given by the Prussian King Frederick William I to his ally Tsar Peter the Great of the Russian Empire. In Russia, the room was installed in the Catherine Palace. After expansion and several renovations, it covered more than and contained over of amber.

The Amber Room was looted during World War II by the Army Group North of Nazi Germany, and taken to Königsberg for reconstruction and display. Some time in early 1944, with Allied forces closing in on Germany, the room was disassembled and crated for storage in the Castle basement. Königsberg was destroyed by Allied bombers in August 1944 and documentation of the room location ends there. Its eventual fate and current whereabouts, if it survives, remain a mystery. In 1979, the decision was taken to create a reconstructed Amber Room at the Catherine Palace in Pushkin. After decades of work by Russian craftsmen and donations from Germany, it was completed and inaugurated in 2003.

==Architecture==
The Amber Room is a priceless piece of art, with extraordinary architectural features, such as gilding, carvings, 450 kg (990 lb) of amber panels, gold leaf, gemstones, and mirrors, all highlighted with candle light. Additional architectural and design features include statues of angels and children.

Because of its unique features and singular beauty, the original Amber Room was sometimes dubbed the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;. Modern estimates of the room&#x27;s value range from $142 million (2007) to over $500 million (2016).

==History==
===Creation===

The Amber Room was begun in 1701 with the purpose of being installed at Charlottenburg Palace, the residence of Frederick, the first King in Prussia, at the urging of his second wife, Sophia Charlotte. The concept and design of the room was drafted by Andreas Schlüter. It was fabricated by Gottfried Wolfram, master craftsman to the Danish court of King Frederick IV of Denmark, with help from the amber masters Ernst Schacht and Gottfried Turau from Danzig, now Gdańsk in Poland.

Although originally intended for installation at Charlottenburg Palace, the complete panels were eventually installed at Berlin City Palace. The Amber Room did not, however, remain at Berlin City Palace for long. Peter the Great of Russia admired it during a visit, and in 1716, King Frederick I&#x27;s son Frederick William I presented the room to Peter as a gift, which forged a Russo-Prussian alliance against Sweden.

The original Berlin design of the Amber Room was reworked in Russia in a joint effort by German and Russian craftsmen. It was Peter&#x27;s daughter Empress Elizabeth who decided the amber treasure should be installed at Catherine Palace, where the Russian Imperial family typically spent their summers. After several other 18th-century renovations, the room covered more than and contained over of amber. The room took over ten years to construct.

===Theft during World War II===
Shortly after the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in World War II, the curators responsible for removing the art treasures in Leningrad tried to disassemble and remove the Amber Room. However, over the years the amber had dried out and become brittle, making it impossible to move the room without the amber crumbling. The Amber Room was therefore hidden behind mundane wallpaper, in an attempt to keep German forces from seizing it, but the attempt to hide such a well-known piece of art failed.

German soldiers of Army Group North disassembled the Amber Room within 36 hours under the supervision of two experts. On 14 October 1941, the priceless room reached Königsberg in East Prussia, for storage and display in the town&#x27;s castle. On 13 November 1941, a Königsberg newspaper announced an exhibition of the Amber Room at Königsberg Castle.

===Last days in Königsberg===
Orders given by Hitler on 21 and 24 January 1945 ordered the movement of looted possessions from Königsberg. This allowed Albert Speer, Reichsminister of Armaments, and his administration team to transport cultural goods of priority. However, before the Amber Room could be moved, Erich Koch, who was in charge of civil administration in Königsberg during the final months of the war, abandoned his post and fled from the city, leaving General Otto Lasch in command.

In August 1944, Königsberg was heavily fire-bombed by the Royal Air Force. It suffered further extensive damage from the artillery of the advancing Red Army before the final occupation on 9 April 1945.

== Disappearance and mysteries ==
After the war, the Amber Room was never seen in public again, though reports have occasionally surfaced stating that pieces of the Amber Room survived the war. Several eyewitnesses claimed to have spotted the famous room being loaded on board the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot;, which left Gdynia on 30 January 1945, and was then promptly torpedoed and sunk by a Soviet submarine.
In 1997, an Italian stone mosaic &quot;Feel and Touch&quot; that was part of a set of four stones which had decorated the Amber Room was found in Germany, in the possession of the family of a soldier who claimed to have helped pack up the amber chamber. The mosaic came into the hands of the Russian authorities and was used in the reconstruction.
In 1998, two separate teams, one German and one Lithuanian, announced they had located the Amber Room. The German team pointed to a silver mine while the Lithuanian team believed the amber treasure was buried in a lagoon; neither of the two locations turned out to hold the Amber Room.

In 2004, a lengthy investigation by British investigative journalists Catherine Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy concluded that the Amber Room was most likely destroyed when Königsberg Castle was damaged, first during the bombing of Königsberg by the Royal Air Force in 1944 and then by the Soviets&#x27; burning of the castle followed by shelling of the remaining walls. Official assessments, set out in documents from the Russian National Archives written by Alexander Brusov, head of the Soviet team charged with locating the Amber Room following the war, agreed with this theory. The official report stated: &quot;Summarizing all the facts, we can say that the Amber Room was destroyed between 9 and 11 April 1945.&quot;

These dates correspond with the end of the Battle of Königsberg, which on 9 April ended with the surrender of the German garrison. A few years later, Brusov publicly voiced a contrary opinion; this is believed to have been done due to pressure from Soviet authorities, who did not want to be seen as responsible for the loss of the Amber Room.

Among other information retrieved from the archives was the revelation that the remaining Italian stone mosaics were found in the burned debris of the castle. Scott-Clark and Levy concluded in their report that the reason the Soviets conducted extensive searches for the Amber Room, even though their own experts had concluded that it was destroyed, was because they wanted to know if any of their own soldiers had been responsible for the destruction. Scott-Clark and Levy also assessed that others in the Soviet government found the theft of the Amber Room a useful Cold War propaganda tool. Russian government officials have since denied these conclusions. Adelaida Yolkina, senior researcher at the Pavlovsk Palace, reportedly stated: &quot;It is impossible to see the Red Army being so careless that they let the Amber Room be destroyed&quot;.

After the report was made public, Leonid Arinshtein, who was a lieutenant in the Red Army in charge of a rifle platoon during the Battle of Königsberg, said: &quot;I probably was one of the last people who saw the Amber Room&quot;. At the same time, he explained that the whole city was burning due to artillery bombardments, but also denied allegations that the Red Army burned the city on purpose, saying: &quot;What soldiers would burn the city where they will have to stay?&quot;

A variation of this theory by some present-day residents of Kaliningrad (formerly Königsberg), is that at least parts of the room were found in the Königsberg Castle cellars after World War II by the Red Army. The Amber Room was allegedly still in good condition; this was not admitted at the time so the blame could fall upon the Nazis. To preserve this story, access to the ruins of the castle, which was allowed after World War II, was suddenly restricted to all, including historical and archaeological surveys, but the room is said to be in a storehouse near Königsberg Castle.

Then in 1968, despite academic protests worldwide, Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev ordered the destruction of Königsberg Castle, thus making any onsite research of the last known resting place of the Amber Room all but impossible. Later the search for the Amber Room continued in different locations, including near Wuppertal, Germany.
Another hypothesis involves a bunker in Mamerki in northeastern Poland, or that Stalin ordered the Amber Room replaced with a replica prior to its looting, hiding the original. The main problem with finding the Amber Room is that the Nazi regime hid many items in many difficult-to-reach places, usually without documentation, leaving a wide search area. The Germans also moved items to destinations far from Europe in some cases. The search for the Amber Room has also been halted by authorities. In the case of Frýdlant castle it was halted because of the historic value of the castle.

In October 2020 Polish divers from the Baltictech group found the wreck of the SS &quot;Karlsruhe&quot;, a ship which took part in Operation Hannibal, a sea evacuation which allowed more than a million German troops and civilians from East Prussia to escape advancing Soviet forces. The ship was attacked off the coast of Poland by Soviet aircraft after it sailed from Königsberg in 1945. The wreck holds many crates with unknown contents. An online news website, Live Science, reports that this German steamship may hold crates that contain parts of the Amber Room, but divers subsequently discovered that the crates on the ship contained military equipment and personal belongings

==Reconstruction==

In 1979, the Soviet government decided to construct a replica of the Amber Room at Tsarskoye Selo, a process that was to take 24 years and require 40 Russian and German experts in amber craftsmanship. Using original drawings and old black-and-white photographs, every attempt was made to duplicate the original Amber Room. This included the 350 shades of amber in the original panels and fixtures that adorned the room. A major problem was the lack of skilled workers, since amber carving was a nearly lost art form.

The financial difficulties that plagued the reconstruction project from the start were solved with the donation of US$3.5 million from the German company E.ON. By 2003, the work of the Russian craftsmen was mostly completed. The new room was dedicated by Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg.
In Kleinmachnow, near Berlin, there is a miniature Amber Room, fabricated after the original. The Berlin miniature collector Ulla Klingbeil had this copy made of original East Prussian amber.

<text>Reginald Ray (born 1942) is an American Buddhist academic and teacher.

Ray studied Tibetan Buddhism, traditional shamanic wisdom, and yogic-contemplative practices with the Tibetan refugee and recognized Vajrayana traditional-wisdom holder Chögyam Trungpa; and later studied under the tutelage of traditional Dagara teacher from Burkina Faso, Malidoma Somé.

A founding academic member of Naropa University, Ray was a longtime senior teacher in Vajradhatu (renamed Shambhala International in 2000) and from 1996 to 2004 was teacher-in-residence at the Rocky Mountain Shambhala Center (which became Shambhala Mountain Center in February 2000). He left the Shambhala organization to found his own teaching center in 2005, Dharma Ocean. Dhama Ocean, in addition to teaching meditation programs and hosting intensive retreats, is a non-profit foundation &quot;dedicated to the practice, study and preservation of the teachings of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche.&quot;

Ray has a BA in religion from Williams College (1965), and received an M.A. (1967) and Ph.D. (1973) in History of Religions from the University of Chicago Divinity School, where he focused on Buddhism and Indian religions. Among his mentors at Chicago was Mircea Eliade, a Romanian historian of religion.

==Teaching career==
Ray first encountered his main Buddhist teacher, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, in 1970, and studied with him until Rinpoche&#x27;s death in 1987. In 1974, at the invitation of Trungpa Rinpoche, Ray left a tenure-track position at Indiana University and relocated to Boulder, Colorado—then the center of Trungpa Rinpoche&#x27;s community–to become the first full-time faculty member and chair of the Buddhist Studies Department at Naropa University, where he taught until his retirement in July 2009. Ray also served on the Nalanda Translation Committee and held a half-time appointment in the Religious Studies department at the University of Colorado.

From 1996 to 2004, Ray was teacher-in-residence at the Rocky Mountain Dharma Center, which became the Shambhala Mountain Center in February 2000. Ray is the director of the Dharma Ocean Foundation.

<text>Varennes-en-Argonne (, literally &quot;Varennes in Argonne&quot;) or simply Varennes (German: Wöringen) is a commune in the Meuse department in the Grand Est region in Northeastern France. In 2019, it had a population of 639.

==Geography==
Varennes-en-Argonne lies on the river Aire to the northeast of Sainte-Menehould, near Verdun.

==History==
Varennes is most notable as it was the ending point of the Flight to Varennes. In June 1791, Louis XVI and his immediate family made a dash for the nearest friendly border, that of the Austrian Netherlands in modern Belgium (Queen Marie Antoinette being a sister to Leopold II, Archduke of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor). In Varennes, Louis and his family were arrested by Jean-Baptiste Drouet, the local postmaster, who had been alerted by a message received from nearby Sainte-Menehould. It is said that at Sainte-Menehould, where the escaping party had spent the previous night, a merchant alerted the town authorities of their presence after recognizing the King&#x27;s face on an Assignat as Louis tried to buy something from a shop. The royal family was returned to the Tuileries in humiliating captivity, and Louis and Marie-Antoinette were subsequently guillotined in 1793.

Located in the Zone rouge, Varennes was completely destroyed during the First World War but was reconstructed afterwards. The Pennsylvania Memorial, a monument for volunteers from 28th Division Pennsylvania in the First World War, was erected in Varennes during the Interwar period.

<doc id="291043" wikidata="Q1898494" url="?curid=291043" title="HMS Resolution (1771)">
<text>HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; was a sloop of the Royal Navy, a converted merchant collier purchased by the Navy and adapted, in which Captain James Cook made his second and third voyages of exploration in the Pacific. She impressed him enough that he called her &quot;the ship of my choice&quot;, and &quot;the fittest for service of any I have seen&quot;.

==Purchase and refitting==

&quot;Resolution&quot; began her career as the North Sea collier &quot;Marquis of Granby&quot;, launched at Whitby in 1770, and purchased by the Royal Navy in 1771 for £4,151 (equivalent to £ today). She was originally registered as HMS &quot;Drake&quot;, but fearing this would upset the Spanish, she was soon renamed &quot;Resolution&quot;, on 25 December 1771. She was fitted out at Deptford with the most advanced navigational aids of the day, including an azimuth compass made by Henry Gregory, ice anchors, and the latest apparatus for distilling fresh water from sea water. Her armament consisted of twelve 6-pounder guns and 12 swivel guns. At his own expense Cook had brass door-hinges installed in the great cabin. It was originally planned that the naturalist Joseph Banks and an appropriate entourage would sail with Cook, so a heightened waist, an additional upper deck and a raised poop deck were built to suit Banks. This refit cost £10,080.12.9d. However, in sea trials the ship was found to be top-heavy, and under Admiralty instructions the offending structures were removed in a second refit at Sheerness, at a further cost of £882.3.0d. Banks subsequently refused to travel under the resulting &quot;adverse conditions&quot; and Johann Reinhold Forster and his son, George, replaced him.

==Cook&#x27;s second voyage==

&quot;Resolution&quot; departed Sheerness on 21 June 1772, carrying 118 people, including 20 volunteers who had sailed on Cook&#x27;s first voyage in HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; in 1768–1771, and two years of provisions. She joined HMS &quot;Adventure&quot; at Plymouth and the two ships departed English waters on 13 July 1772.

&quot;Resolution&quot;&#x27;s first port of call was at Funchal in the Madeira Islands, which she reached on 1 August. Cook gave high praise to her sailing qualities in a report to the Admiralty from Funchal Roads, writing that she &quot;steers, works, sails well and is remarkably stiff and seems to promise to be a dry and very easy ship in the sea&quot;. The ship was reprovisioned with fresh water, beef, fruit and onions, and after a further provisioning stop in the Cape Verde Islands two weeks later, set sail due south toward the Cape of Good Hope. Several of the crew had brought monkeys aboard as pets, but Cook had them thrown overboard to prevent their droppings from fouling the ship.

On his first voyage Cook had calculated longitude by the usual method of lunars, but on her second voyage the Board of Longitude sent a highly qualified astronomer, William Wales, with Cook and entrusted him with a new marine chronometer, the K1,
recently completed by Larcum Kendall, together with three chronometers made by John Arnold. Kendall&#x27;s K1 was remarkably accurate and was to prove to be most efficient in determining longitude on board &quot;Resolution&quot;.

On 17 January 1773, &quot;Resolution&quot; was the first ship to cross the Antarctic Circle and crossed twice more on the voyage. The third crossing, on 3 February 1774, was the most southerly penetration, reaching latitude 71°10′ South at longitude 106°54′ West. &quot;Resolution&quot; thus proved Alexander Dalrymple&#x27;s &quot;Terra Australis Incognita&quot; to be a myth. She returned to Britain in 1775 and was then paid off.

==Cook&#x27;s third voyage==

She was recommissioned in February 1776 for Cook&#x27;s third voyage, which began on 12 July 1776, departing from Plymouth, England, during which &quot;Resolution&quot; crossed the Arctic Circle on 17 August 1778, and again crossed it on 19 July 1779, under the command of Charles Clerke after Cook&#x27;s death in Hawaii. She arrived back in Britain on 4 October 1780.

==Later service and loss==
In 1780, &quot;Resolution&quot; was converted into an armed transport and sailed for the East Indies in March 1781. &quot;Sphinx&quot; and &quot;Annibal&quot; of Suffren&#x27;s (French) squadron captured &quot;Resolution&quot; on 9 June 1782. In early July 1782, during the run-up of the Battle of Negapatam, Suffren sent &quot;Resolution&quot; to Manila to purchase spare spars, food and ammunition to resupply his fleet. She then sailed on 22 July 1782 and was never seen again.

On 5 June 1783, Suffren wrote that &quot;Resolution&quot; had last been seen in the Sunda Strait, and that he suspected she had either foundered or fallen into the hands of the English. An item from the Melbourne &quot;Argus&quot;, 25 February 1879, said that she ended her days as a Portuguese coal-hulk at Rio de Janeiro, but this has never been confirmed. Viscount Galway, a Governor-General of New Zealand, owned a ship&#x27;s figurehead described as that of &quot;Resolution&quot;, but a photograph of it does not agree with the figurehead depicted in Holman&#x27;s famous watercolour of her.

Alternatively, in 1789 she may have been renamed &quot;Général Conway&quot;, in November 1790 &quot;Amis Réunis&quot;, and in 1792 &quot;Liberté&quot;. Martin Dugard&#x27;s biography of Cook, &quot;Farther Than Any Man&quot;, published in 2001, states: &quot;Her fate, by some cruel twist of historical irony, is as incredible as &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s – she &quot;[Resolution]&quot; was sold to the French, rechristened &quot;La Liberté&quot;, and transformed into a whaler, then ended her days rotting in Newport Harbor. She settled to the bottom just a mile from &quot;Endeavour&quot;.&quot; (p. 281, Epilogue)

In 1881 the British Consul in Alexandria, looking from the Ras El Tin Palace, pointed out a ship in the harbour he identified as the &quot;Resolution&quot;, to William N. Armstrong, attendant to Hawaiian King David Kalākaua during his trip around the world.

<text>HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; (S22) was the first of the Royal Navy&#x27;s ballistic missile submarines. She operated from 1968 until 1994 providing the UK Polaris at sea nuclear deterrent.

== Construction ==
The submarine was ordered on 21 May 1963 with Vickers Armstrong at a cost of £40.2m.

The keel was laid down at Barrow-in-Furness on 26 February 1964 by the Director General Ships, Sir Alfred Sims.

She was launched was on 15 September 1966, attended by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. After fitting out, she proceeded to sea on 22 June 1967. The submarine was commissioned on 2 October 1967, and following extensive trials, including the firing of her first Polaris missile on 15 February 1968, commenced her first patrol on 14 June 1968. To ensure continuous operation, she was the first Royal Navy submarine to operate with two dedicated crews, who would relieve each other, known as port and starboard respectively.

== Service ==
The ship was assigned to the 10th Submarine Squadron (United Kingdom) where it operated as the first of the UKs new Polaris based nuclear deterrent.

Her Polaris system was updated in 1984 with the &quot;Chevaline&quot; IFE (Improved Front End) that included two new warheads and re-entry bodies and penaids, super-hardened to resist ABM attack, replacing the original three ET.317 warheads.

&quot;Resolution&quot; conducted the longest patrol of any Polaris submarine being at sea for 108 days in 1991.

=== Alleged use during the Falklands War ===
During the early stages of the Falklands War, the BBC World News reported that &quot;Resolution&quot; was stationed off Buenos Aires. A similar story appeared in 1984 in the New Statesman which alleged that &quot;Resolution&quot; was sent south, as a means of launching a nuclear attack against Córdoba in the event that a Royal Navy aircraft carrier be sunk.
In reality, &quot;Resolution&quot;&#x27;s crew were having to deal with an upsurge of Soviet SSN activity, with &quot;Resolution&quot; having to take evasive action to avoid a November-class submarine. Despite Soviet efforts, &quot;Resolution&quot; was never found during her 72-day patrol.

==Decommission==
Following the completion of the first Trident-carrying in 1992, the &quot;Resolution&quot; class were gradually removed from service. &quot;Resolution&quot; was decommissioned on 22 October 1994, after 69 patrols, and laid up at the Rosyth Dockyard. She remains in the main basin at Rosyth, intact but with her reactor defuelled; the MOD has yet to finalise plans for removal of the radioactive reactor parts and the scrapping of the boat.

<doc id="291049" wikidata="Q3107406" url="?curid=291049" title="The Tonight Show with Jay Leno">
<text>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno is an American television talk show broadcast by NBC. The show is the fourth and sixth installment of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Hosted by Jay Leno, it aired from May 25, 1992, to May 29, 2009, replacing &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and was replaced by &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. The show returned from March 1, 2010, to February 6, 2014, replacing &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and was replaced by &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;.

The fourth incarnation of the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; franchise debuted on May 25, 1992, three days after Johnny Carson&#x27;s retirement as host of the program. The program originated from NBC Studios in Burbank, California, and was broadcast Monday through Friday at 11:35p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (10:35p.m. Central/Mountain time). Unlike Carson or his predecessor Jack Paar, Leno only once used a guest host, preferring to host the series in person.

The series, which followed the same basic format as that of its predecessors (an opening monologue followed by comedy routines, interviews and performances), ran until May 29, 2009, after which Leno was succeeded by Conan O&#x27;Brien. NBC signed Leno to a new deal for a nightly talk show in the 10:00 pm ET timeslot. The primetime series, titled &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, debuted on September 14, 2009, following a similar format to the Leno incarnation of &quot;Tonight&quot;.

Neither O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s version of the program, which premiered June 1, 2009, nor &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; generated the ratings NBC had expected. The network decided to move a condensed 30-minute version of Leno&#x27;s show to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s time slot, and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; a half-hour later. This decision met with opposition from O&#x27;Brien, whose stint on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; ended January 22, 2010, after which he began his own talk show, &quot;Conan&quot;, on TBS. &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; then began its second incarnation, the sixth of the franchise, on March 1, 2010. Leno left &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; for good on February 6, 2014, and on February 17, was succeeded by &quot;Late Night&quot; host Jimmy Fallon, at which time the series returned to New York for the first time since 1972.

== History ==

=== Succession from Carson ===

Johnny Carson retired from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on May 22, 1992, and was replaced by Jay Leno. David Letterman wanted to move into the earlier time slot from his late night spot after &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and he was also considered by many as the natural successor (despite Leno having been Carson&#x27;s permanent guest host for several years). Carson always favored Letterman; notably, Carson, who had been interviewed by Letterman, made two appearances on Letterman&#x27;s rival CBS show, made no mention of Leno during his final shows and regularly sent Letterman monologue jokes in his final years. With his heart set on the earlier time slot, Letterman left NBC in June 1993 and joined CBS that August. &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, airing in the same slot, competed against &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; for the remainder of Leno&#x27;s run. Leno would outdo Letterman in ratings for the majority of the show&#x27;s run. Conan O&#x27;Brien slid into the late night time slot vacated by Letterman in September 1993.

=== First end of Leno on &quot;Tonight&quot; ===
On September 27, 2004, the 50th anniversary of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;″s debut, NBC announced Leno would be succeeded by O&#x27;Brien, in 2009. Leno explained he did not want to see a repeat of the hard feelings and controversy that occurred when he was given the show over Letterman following Carson&#x27;s retirement.

It was announced on July 21, 2008, that Leno would host his final episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on Friday, May 29, 2009, with O&#x27;Brien and James Taylor as his guests. O&#x27;Brien took over hosting duties commencing the following Monday, on June 1, 2009.

On December 9, 2008, it was announced Leno would be hosting a new nightly show in September 2009, which aired at 10 pm ET, during the network&#x27;s prime time period. &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; ended after a short run on February 9, 2010.

=== Second incarnation ===

On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that effective March 1, 2010, &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; would move from the 10 pm (Eastern/Pacific Time) weeknight time slot to 11:35 pm and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; would move from 11:35 pm to 12:05 am. On January 12, 2010, O&#x27;Brien publicly announced in an open letter that he intended to leave NBC if they moved &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; to 12:05 am ET/PT to accommodate moving &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; to 11:35 pm Eastern/10:35 pm Central, due to poor ratings. After several days of negotiations, O&#x27;Brien reached a settlement with NBC that allowed him to leave NBC and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on January 22, 2010.

On January 21, 2010, NBC announced Leno would return to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. Jay Leno began his second tenure on March 1, 2010, after the 2010 Winter Olympics. The show moved to Stage 11 in Burbank, the former home of &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, with a similar set and theme song of &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;. &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; bandleader Kevin Eubanks announced on April 12 he would be leaving &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on May 28 after 18 years with Leno. Eubanks&#x27; replacement was former &quot;American Idol&quot; musical director Rickey Minor. Minor composed a new main theme when he took over.

On July 1, 2010, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that only six months into its second life, Leno&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; posted its lowest ratings since 1992. By September 2010, Leno&#x27;s ratings in the adults 18–49 demographic had fallen below those of O&#x27;Brien when he had hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. NBC ratings specialist Tom Bierbaum commented that due to the host being out of late night television for a period of time and the subsequent 2010 &quot;Tonight Show&quot; conflict, Leno&#x27;s ratings fall was &quot;not a surprise at all&quot;. In October 2010, David Letterman beat Leno&#x27;s program in the ratings, for the first time since Leno returned to hosting &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. By May 2011, Leno&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot; regained the lead and held it since then. However, by August 2012, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was reporting that &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; was in serious trouble for a number of reasons, most notably that NBC was losing money. While Leno offered to take a pay cut, at least 24 members of his staff were laid off. By March 2013, there were rumors that NBC would have Jimmy Fallon, who had been hosting &quot;Late Night&quot; since 2009 when he succeeded O&#x27;Brien, become the next host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; when Leno&#x27;s current contract ended in 2014 and NBC would move the show back to New York for the first time in over 40 years. On May 13, 2013, during its fall &quot;upfronts&quot; presentation, NBC confirmed Fallon would take over as host of the &quot;Tonight Show&quot; beginning on February 17, 2014; Seth Meyers, in turn, would leave &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (where he was the anchor of &quot;Weekend Update&quot;) and take over Fallon&#x27;s time slot.

Leno&#x27;s final episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; aired on February 6, 2014. Per the terms on his deal with NBC, his staff was paid through September 2014. Leno wrapped up the night before the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, which began on February 7. Fallon took over &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; on February 17.
Leno himself would later appear multiple times on Jimmy Fallon&#x27;s version of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, such as a June 15, 2016, appearance in which Leno not only appeared as a guest, he delivered part of that night&#x27;s monologue, commenting on the 2016 US election campaign.
(Leno came out to do the monologue after Fallon faked an injury.)

== Production ==
From 1992 to 2009, the show was taped at NBC Studios&#x27; (now The Burbank Studios) Studio 1 and 3, and from 2009 to 2014 in Studio 11.

On April 26, 1999, the show began broadcasting in digital HDTV 1080i, becoming the first American nightly talk show to be shot in high definition. The show was recorded in two channel stereo sound and shot with ten Sony HD cameras including four Sony HDC-700A, three Sony HDC-750A, and three Sony DXC-H10 point of view cameras in 16:9 aspect ratio in the year 2000. The show was directly fed to network affiliates through SBS-4 satellite and NTSC feed was sent to New York via AT&amp;T fiber and was uplinked by New York to its affiliates.

=== Finances ===
During the last year with Leno as host, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; cost about $1.7 million a week to produce. With 45 weeks of annual production, that amounted to about $76.5 million, excluding the salaries for Leno and the show&#x27;s &quot;top producers&quot;.

In that same period, the show had been generating an estimated $30–40 million a year in profit, down from the $150 million a year the franchise once made.&quot;

=== Format ===
The show follows an established six-piece format. After the announcer announces the opening credits for the show, the first segment is a ten-minute monologue by Leno, with jokes about current events and brief comedy sketches occasionally mixed in. The second segment is a full comedy sketch, such as a mini-documentary by a &quot;&quot;Tonight Show&quot; correspondent&quot; (e.g., Ross the Intern or Mikey Day), or a trademark of Leno&#x27;s, such as Headlines.

The first guest appears, with the interview is divided into two segments, then followed by an interview with the second guest in the fifth segment. The sixth and final segment is typically a performance by a musical guest or stand-up comedian.

Immediately following the last performance segment, Leno walks on camera to thank the performers, bid farewell to the audience and recommends watching &quot;Late Night&quot; which immediately follows &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;. As the closing credits roll on-screen, the closing theme, composed by bandleader Rickey Minor plays the show off the air.

=== Bandleader ===
Branford Marsalis was the original bandleader of the show from 1992 to 1995, leaving the show after feeling displeased with his role on the show, what he called being an &quot;ass-kisser&quot;. Kevin Eubanks, who was the guitarist in Marsalis&#x27; band, moved up to bandleader forming &quot;Kevin Eubanks and The Tonight Show Band&quot; and remained with &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; until 2010, when he left to concentrate on music, adding that his leaving was not provoked by any problems with Leno or NBC. Eubanks would later reunite with Leno as co-host of Leno&#x27;s version of &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;.

Rickey Minor, former &quot;American Idol&quot; music director, replaced Eubanks, forming &quot;Rickey Minor and The Tonight Show Band&quot;, staying until the end of Leno&#x27;s tenure.

=== Announcer ===
Edd Hall served as announcer on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; from 1992 until 2004. Hall occasionally appeared in skits during the opening monologue. These skits often involved slapstick injury to Hall (by using a stunt double, dummy, or film clip), such as vehicles running him over in the studio parking lot. Unlike his predecessors on &quot;Tonight&quot; (i.e. McMahon with Carson, Hugh Downs with Jack Paar), Hall did not serve as a sidekick for Leno during his tenure on Leno&#x27;s incarnation of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

Hall was controversially replaced in 2004 by &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; staff member John Melendez in what many perceived as a thinly veiled attempt to attract a younger demographic and nonsensical considering his &quot;stuttering&quot; moniker. The hiring of Melendez which was carried out by Leno without Stern&#x27;s knowledge, prompted a rift between Stern and Leno. Stern launched into tirades on his show for many weeks on saying Leno was &quot;ripping him off&quot;, citing previously &quot;lifted&quot; material from his show such as &quot;Jaywalking&quot; ripping off Stern&#x27;s &quot;homeless game&quot;; for example, stating &quot;To an 18- to 25-year-old male, Jay Leno is gay. He might as well put a dress on.&quot; Since the move to &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;, Melendez was replaced as announcer, but remained on the writing staff. Wally Wingert would be the only off-camera announcer for Leno&#x27;s second &quot;Tonight&quot; tenure, carrying over his duties from &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;.

== Recurring segments ==
==Notable episodes==
*On May 25, 1992, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; debuted on NBC. Jay&#x27;s guests on his first show as permanent host were Billy Crystal, Shanice, and Robert Krulwich.
*On May 20, 1993, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; traveled to the Bull &amp; Finch Pub in Boston, Massachusetts, to celebrate the final episode of &quot;Cheers&quot;. This is the first time that &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; is taped on the road.
*On May 9, 1994, Bobcat Goldthwait appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, where he set the guest chair on fire. Leno throws a cup of coffee, and tells Bobcat to sit down.
*On August 22, 1994, Leno eulogized his father, who had recently died. After his monologue, Leno sat behind his desk and told the audience about his father&#x27;s life and how his father had supported him in his career. Leno noted a moment when, upon Carson&#x27;s disapproval at Leno being his successor, his father had encouraged him and told him to &quot;fight the good fight&quot;. Leno ended the tribute saying, &quot;You know, it really is lonely at the top. You have no idea. But... we&#x27;ll fight the good fight, Pop.&quot;
*On July 10, 1995, Hugh Grant appeared in public for the first time after his arrest on lewd conduct charges the previous month. Leno famously asked him &quot;What the hell were you thinking?&quot; In response, Grant told Leno, &quot;I think you know in life what&#x27;s a good thing to do and what&#x27;s a bad thing, and I did a bad thing...and there you have it.&quot; The appearance was the first episode in which Leno beat CBS rival David Letterman.
*On November 30, 1995, Howard Stern, who had made two highly rated appearances in 1992 and 1993, appeared with bikini-clad porn stars Nikki Tyler and Janine Lindemulder, attempting to show &quot;the Tonight Show&#x27;s first lesbian kiss&quot; and encouraging Leno to spank one of them. Stern and the women remained during Siskel and Ebert&#x27;s segment, where he began to suck one of their toes, to raucous applause and behavior from the crowd. Leno was visibly uncomfortable during both segments, repeatedly telling Stern &quot;it will all be edited out&quot;, and hastily trying to interview Siskel &amp; Ebert while the crowd went wild at Stern&#x27;s antics. Leno ended the show early by walking off the air, which was edited out when it aired a few hours later, as revealed by Stern when he went on the air (on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;) the following morning. Despite the situation, Leno called into the show that morning claiming Stern had &quot;gone beyond the acceptable standards&quot;. Stern said Leno should not have &quot;been so uptight&quot; and he had a &quot;real&quot; reaction to the situation which was great. Stern recounted Leno had yelled at his producer Gary Dell&#x27;Abate saying Stern had &quot;&#x27;s-d&#x27; in his house&quot; and supposedly &quot;grabbed his crotch&quot; and yelled &quot;Pussy, Pussy, Pussy! That&#x27;s all it is with Howard&quot; which Leno denied but agreed he had been angered by Stern.
*On March 13, 2000, New York Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn came onstage during Leno&#x27;s interview with his girlfriend, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; star Angie Harmon, surprising her by proposing in front of Jay, the audience, and musical guest Elton John. Harmon tearfully said yes, and Elton performed after the break. One night later in the monologue, Leno cracked up the audience by saying the episode was like every date he had in college: &quot;The pretty girl ran off with the football player, and I was left alone listening to Elton John!&quot;
*In September 2000, with California in an energy crisis that forced blackouts, Leno did an episode in the dark using only candles and flashlights known as &quot;The Tonight Show Unplugged&quot;.
*Following the September 11 attacks, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; was off the air for about a week, as were most similar programs. The first post-9/11 episode began with a still image of an American flag and a subdued opening without the usual opening credits. Leno&#x27;s monologue paid tribute to those who lost their lives and to firefighters, police and rescue workers across the US. Leno had questioned whether a show that regularly poked fun at the government could continue after the attacks, but in his monologue he explained that he also saw the show as a respite from the grim news of the world, akin to a cookie or glass of lemonade handed to a firefighter. He also told a story about himself as a 12-year-old Boy Scout, which Leno said he was not a very good at because of his dyslexia. His scoutmaster gave him the task of being the &quot;cheermaster&quot; of the troop, in which Leno told jokes to the troop to keep their spirits up. Senator John McCain and the musical group Crosby, Stills, and Nash were featured guests. Leno also organized an auction for a Harley-Davidson motorcycle signed by celebrities (he signed his name on-stage), with the proceeds going to 9/11 support organizations. For an extended period after the attack, a short clip of a large American flag waving was shown in between the announcement of the musical guest and Leno&#x27;s introduction during the opening montage.
*On May 12, 2003, Katie Couric hosted &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; for a day. Couric&#x27;s guests on that night&#x27;s show were Mike Myers, Simon Cowell, and Robbie Williams.
*On August 6, 2003, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and confirmed he would be running against California governor Gray Davis for the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election. Schwarzenegger won the election on October 7.
*On January 24, 2005, Leno had a special episode that paid tribute to &quot;Tonight Show&quot; predecessor Johnny Carson, who had died the day before. During the opening credits, the guests of that show were simply announced using pictures from when they were on Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;, and the monologue simply gave condolence to Carson. There were no segments used; however, Leno played clips from &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; before commercials. All the guests were people who had worked with Carson, and had been on his show, including Ed McMahon, Drew Carey, Don Rickles, and Bob Newhart.
*On July 20, 2006, as Colin Farrell was being interviewed by Leno, Farrell&#x27;s stalker, Dessarae Bradford, evaded security, walked on stage as cameras were rolling, confronted Farrell, and threw her book on Leno&#x27;s desk. In front of a silent, stunned audience, Farrell escorted her off the stage himself, told the camera crew to stop filming, and handed her over to security. As Bradford was led out of the studio, she shouted &quot;I&#x27;ll see you in court!&quot; Farrell&#x27;s response was simply, &quot;Darling, you&#x27;re insane!&quot; Outside the studio, NBC security handed her to Burbank police, who eventually released her. While waiting to begin filming again, a shocked Leno sarcastically called for &quot;a round of applause for NBC security&quot; from the audience. After Farrell apologized to the audience, describing Bradford as &quot;my first stalker&quot;, the show then continued filming and the incident was edited out of the broadcast aired that night. Farrell later requested a restraining order in court against Bradford.
*On July 24, 2007, the monologue was animated by Homer Simpson. Simpson gave a short monologue to the audience, and was &quot;kicked out&quot; by Leno. This sketch was to promote &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;.
*On January 2, 2008, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (along with &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;) returned to air without writers, with the WGA still on strike. This was in response to the deal by David Letterman&#x27;s production company Worldwide Pants and CBS Paramount Television with the WGA to allow &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; to return with writers. Leno&#x27;s guest that night, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, was criticized for crossing the WGA picket line to appear on the show. Huckabee would go on to win the Iowa caucuses the very next day.
*On June 13, 2008, Leno delivered the news of Tim Russert&#x27;s death to his audience during his monologue, and set aside some time in it to remember his old colleague. Leno then stated that he would continue the show as normal afterwards.
*On March 19, 2009, Barack Obama appeared on the show. This marked the first time that a sitting President of the United States appeared on a late night talk show. President Obama came under fire for a remark made about the Special Olympics, which he made in reference to Leno&#x27;s congratulations to Obama&#x27;s low bowling score.
*On March 1, 2010, Leno made his return to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with a re-written version of &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot; theme song and a renovated Stage 11. Leno&#x27;s guests were Jamie Foxx, Olympic Gold medalist Lindsey Vonn, and musical guest Brad Paisley. Leno also did a segment searching for a new desk, an element which was not implemented into his primetime show.
* On November 18, 2010, former President George W. Bush made his first appearance on a late night talk show since leaving office.
*On November 23, 2010, former bandleader Kevin Eubanks returned to promote his new album &quot;Zen Food&quot;.
*On March 2, 2011, the 4,000th episode aired.
*On February 6, 2014, Leno hosted his final show, which featured several pre-taped well-wishes (and humorous advice) from a variety of celebrities ranging from Steve Carell to President Barack Obama, who offered Leno an ambassadorship to Antarctica (&quot;Hope you have a warm coat, funnyman.&quot;). Appearing as Leno&#x27;s final guests were Billy Crystal (Leno&#x27;s first guest in 1992) and Garth Brooks. Crystal surprised Leno by leading an on-stage sing-along of &quot;So Long, Farewell&quot; from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, with lyrics for the occasion performed by special guests Jack Black, Kim Kardashian, Chris Paul, Sheryl Crow, Jim Parsons, Carol Burnett, and Oprah Winfrey; Brooks performed his touching song &quot;The Dance&quot; (at Leno&#x27;s request) before closing out the show with the rousing &quot;Friends in Low Places&quot;. In closing &quot;the greatest 22 years of my life&quot;, Leno turned emotional in his final remarks, calling himself &quot;the luckiest guy in the world... I got to meet presidents, astronauts, and movie stars.&quot; Leno also thanked the audience as well as his staff, who &quot;became my family&quot; after the deaths of his parents and his brother early in his &quot;Tonight&quot; tenure.

== Reception ==
Critical reviews for the show were mixed, with a Metacritic score of 49 out of 100, based on 9 reviews. In a negative review, Robert Bianco of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote; &quot;Monday&#x27;s opening monologue, supposedly Leno&#x27;s strong suit, was tired, lame and unfunny. In other words, typical of the real Leno, rather than the Leno of public-relations imagination.&quot;

The show was nominated for an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series category ten times between 1993 and 2005. It won the award in 1995.

== Ratings ==
The 10th Anniversary special, broadcast on April 30, 2002, drew in 11.888 million viewers.

On September 22, 2006, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; led in ratings for the 11th consecutive season, with a nightly average of 5.7 million viewers – 31% of the total audience in that time slot – compared to 4.2 million viewers for &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, 3.4 million for &quot;Nightline&quot; and 1.6 million for &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. Two events helped Leno gain and keep the lead: a new set brought Leno closer to the audience and Hugh Grant kept his July 10, 1995 scheduled appearance, despite having been arrested for seeing a prostitute, where Leno famously asked Grant, &quot;What the hell were you thinking?&quot; The final telecast of the first incarnation of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; had the show&#x27;s highest overnight household rating for a Friday episode in the comedian&#x27;s 17-year run as host of &quot;Tonight&quot;, averaging an 8.8 rating in metered-market households.

For at least six weeks following his return to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Leno&#x27;s program beat Letterman in the overall ratings each night, though with a reduced lead in comparison to his first tenure. By mid-2010, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; was receiving its lowest ratings since 1992, an average of 4 million total viewers, though he remained ahead of Letterman, who experienced a coinciding decline in ratings. In September 2010, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; posted its lowest numbers on record, with Leno averaging 3.8 million viewers. This was a 12% increase in total viewers over O&#x27;Brien at the same time the previous year, but still 23% below O&#x27;Brien in the coveted 18–49 demographic. For the first time in almost 15 years, the show slipped to second place in its time slot being consistently beaten by &quot;Nightline&quot;. In October 2010, Letterman beat Leno&#x27;s program in the ratings, for the first time since Leno returned to hosting &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;.

In the May 2011 sweeps period, all of NBCs late night programming had increased viewership. &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; received a 15% increase in viewership compared with the first 36 weeks of last season. In that process, it outlasted rival late night talk shows &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; on ABC, as well as &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on CBS. Both of Leno&#x27;s lead-in, &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; and &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;, also received increased viewership. For the season, in the 18–49 demographic, &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; had 4 million viewers, compared with &quot;Late Show&quot;, which had 3.5 million, and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, which had only 1.9 million. &quot;Nightline&quot;, though, still beat Leno in the May 2011 sweeps, with 4.4 million viewers.

<text>Arbois () is a commune in the Jura department, in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region, eastern France. The river Cuisance passes through the town, which centres on an arcaded central square where one can sample the local wines.

The commune has been awarded two flowers by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the competition of Cities and Villages in Bloom.

==Geography==
Arbois is located some 40 km southwest of Besançon and 30 km southeast of Dole. With a typical &quot;Revermont&quot; landscape, the plain is mainly used for cropping of cereals on medium-sized plots of land. The lower slopes consist mainly of meadows surrounded by small hedges for dairy farming, with some vineyards located in the same area. The rest of the hills is occupied by small vineyards with a few scattered meadows. The top of the hills and the plateau are heavily forested.

===Communication and transport===

Access to the commune is by Route nationale N83 which comes from Mouchard in the north and passes through the town before continuing south to Buvilly. The D469 goes west from the village to Mathenay and the D107 goes east to Mesnay. The D14 goes north to Villers-Farlay and the D246 goes south to Pupillin.

The town is about 40 minutes drive from Dole (35 km), Besançon (48 km) and Lons-le-Saunier (38 km). It takes about 2 hours to reach Geneva by car, and 1 hour 45 minutes to drive to Lyon.

;SNCF Arbois
The railway station is just north of the town and all TER Franche-Comté (Besançon-Lyon) trains serve this station. The nearest TGV station is at Mouchard on the Paris-Switzerland line.

;Aerodrome
There is a small aerodrome in the north of the commune with the ICAO code LFGD and a restricted use runway.

===Hydrology===

Arbois is traversed by the &quot;Cuisance&quot; river and is part of Revermont since it lies at the foot of the Plateau of Lons-le-Saunier, the first plateau of the Jura.

Together with Salins-les-Bains and Poligny, it forms the &quot;Heart of the Jura&quot; Community of Communes (&quot;Communauté des communes Coeur du Jura).&quot;

===Climate===
This small, historic town often enjoys episodes of fine weather from March through to October. The presence of vineyards reflects this and the Loue and Doubs rivers are far enough away to limit the occurrence of fog in the winter. The influence of the small Cuisance river is low. The town does, however, receive generous amounts of precipitation throughout the year, totaling nearly 1,000 mm annually. The climate is rather continental with cold winters and little snow but hot in summer.

==History==

The origin of the town of Arbois dates back to remote times, although specifications are difficult. It is certain, however, that its wines were known to the Romans.

Until 1260, Arbois was a &quot;villa&quot; or town without defences: it was surrounded by ramparts during the following ten years.

Arbois endured seven sieges when it was part of the Duchy of Burgundy, including sackings by Charles I of Amboise (in 1479 while he was governor of the County of Burgundy under Louis XI), Henry IV (when the town held out for three weeks against the King&#x27;s 25,000 troops), and Louis XIV. A castle was built in 1270, some vestiges of which survived the dismantling that Louis XIV ordered in 1678 following the conquest of Franche-Comté. There remain stretches of wall, pierced for archers, three round towers, and the square Gloriette tower.

When the republic was proclaimed at Lyon on 13 April 1834, the town joined the revolt against the government, which promptly sent a small force of grenadiers, cavalry, and a battery of artillery to subdue it.

The U.S. 36th Infantry Division liberated Arbois in September 1944 as it moved up the Rhône towards Besançon and then on to the Moselle.

===Heraldry===

The Arbois symbol is the heraldic pelican which is called a &quot;Pelican in her piety&quot; who is feeding her young from her beak. This is a Christian symbol and is accompanied by the motto of the city which is &quot;Sic his quos diligo&quot; (So I do for those I love). The Arbois band, which plays during the &quot;Biou&quot; festival is called &quot;Le Pelican&quot; in reference to this symbolic bird. There is also a Guggenmusik band called Biou&#x27;Z&#x27;Musik.

The arms use the colours of the city: yellow (gold) and black (sable) which are an allusion to yellow wine and dark forests.

==Economy==
Arbois is a small rural town with a rich historical heritage and important advantages for agricultural activity such as viticulture, an industrial enterprise among the 10 largest in the department, and tourism based on its heritage and gastronomy.

There is, however, some hidden economic fragility with an aging population, sensitive industries at risk of relocation, a downturn in the diversity of shopping, and an overestimation of the value of property which tends to deter young households.

===Agriculture===

The area produces some of the best Jura wines, including &quot;vin jaune&quot; (yellow wine) and &quot;vin de Paille&quot; (straw wine), in the Arbois AOC; this is the dominant activity. Arbois has many wineries such as Henri Maire, the cooperative Fruitière vinicole d&#x27;Arbois, Rolet, Stéphane Tissot, Jacques Tissot, Domaine de la Pinte, Pascal Clairet, Michel Gahier, Frédéric Lornet, and Fumey-Chatelain.

The Arbois Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée (AOC) was introduced in 1936 and covers 13 communes on the hills and valley slopes surrounding the town. One of these, a small village named Pupillin, is particularly known for the quality of its wines, which come from a patchwork of vineyards planted on south-facing, limestone-rich slopes. Wines from these sites are sold as Arbois-Pupillin. Arbois wines are produced from around 2,100 acres (850ha) of vineyards, planted with Chardonnay, Savagnin, Poulsard (or Ploussard as it is known in the commune), Pinot Noir and Trousseau.

About 70% of Jura&#x27;s red wines are produced under the Arbois name, along with about 30% of its whites.

Some bottles are labeled with the saying (in French): &quot;Arbois wine: the more you drink, the more it goes right!&quot;. An old familiar song, the &quot;Tourdion&quot; is a song on the wines of &quot;Anjou or Arbois&quot;. It is also mentioned by Jacques Brel in his song &quot;Pour mon dernier repas&quot; (For my last meal) as well as by Hubert-Félix Thiéfaine in &quot;La cancoillotte&quot; (The cream cheese). In 1285 the Count of Chiny used to offer it to his guests during the Chauvency Tournament according to the troubadour Jacques Bretel who drank it in the company of Henri de Briey.

Arbois also has dairy farms (Montbéliarde and goat breeds) in the AOC of Comté and Morbier.

===Industry===
Industries other than wine contribute to the wealth of the commune including &quot;Bost-Garnache Industries&quot; (Stanley/Facom Group) which manufactures screwdrivers, SIOBRA who do zinc injection moulding, and CIFC who build industrial wood framing.

==Culture and heritage==
===Civil heritage===
The commune has a number of buildings and structures that are registered as historical monuments:
*The Brand consorts House (13th century)
*The Hydro-Electric Power Station (20th century)
*The Delort House (18th century)
*The Hotel de Broissia (19th century)

The &quot;Tour Gloriette&quot; (Gloriette Tower) was built in the 13th century together with the Tour Velfaux (Vellefaux), and integrated into the Château Pécauld (Pecaud). The Gloriette was one of the principal elements of the city&#x27;s ramparts which stretched for some 1200 metres. It was badly damaged in 1503 when the &quot;Cuisance&quot; overflowed its banks. With a height of 17 metres and a square base 11 metres on each side, the current tower was restored at the beginning of the 16th century. Although the city was attacked by several armies, the tower itself was never attacked.
*Louis Pasteur&#x27;s House (18th century). It was the only house the scientist owned. The house is preserved in its original state, exactly as it was when Louis Pasteur was alive with his private laboratory. The Pasteur House contains many items that are registered as historical objects:

*The Château Pécaud and Velfaux Tower (11th century). The Château Pécauld was built in the 11th and 14th centuries and once belonged to the Dukes of Burgundy. It now houses a small museum dedicated to wine growing and production. By the 13th century, it was part the defences of the city. Its large circular tower is known as the &quot;Tour de Velfaux&quot; after the tower&#x27;s owner, &quot;Guillaume de Velfaux&quot;, who sold it to Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle, the father of Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle. De Grenvelle added to the house proper at the beginning of the 16th century, at the end of which the Pecauld family acquired it. During the French Revolution the house was nationalized and sold in 1826 to the city of Arbois. Later, the Institute of Wines of Jura restored it.

<text>The Secchi disk (or Secchi disc), as created in 1865 by Angelo Secchi, is a plain white, circular disk in diameter used to measure water transparency or turbidity in bodies of water. The disc is mounted on a pole or line and lowered slowly down in the water. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is taken as a measure of the transparency of the water. This measure is known as the Secchi depth and is related to water turbidity. Since its invention, the disk has also been used in a modified, smaller diameter, black-and-white design to measure freshwater transparency.

Similar disks, with a black-and-yellow pattern, are used as fiducial markers on vehicles in crash tests, crash-test dummies, and other kinetic experiments.

==History==
The original Secchi disk was a plain white disk and was used in the Mediterranean Sea. A plain white, diameter Secchi disk remains the standard design used in marine studies. In 1899, George C. Whipple modified the original all-white Secchi disk to &quot;...a disc about 8 inches in diameter, divided into quadrants painted alternately black and white like the target of a level-rod...&quot;. This modified black-and-white Secchi disk is the standard disk used in limnology (freshwater) investigations.

==Secchi depth==

The Secchi depth is reached when the reflectance equals the intensity of light backscattered from the water. 1.7 divided by this depth in metres yields an attenuation coefficient (also called an extinction coefficient), for the available light averaged over the Secchi disk depth. While used as a variable, the extinction coefficient is also used as a variable for turbidity. The light attenuation coefficient, &quot;k&quot;, can then be used in a form of the Beer–Lambert law,
formula_1
to estimate &quot;I&quot;&quot;z&quot;, the intensity of light at depth &quot;z&quot; from &quot;I&quot;0, the intensity of light at the ocean surface.

The Secchi disk readings do not provide an exact measure of transparency, as there can be errors because of the sun&#x27;s glare on the water, or one person may see the disk at one depth, but another person with better eyesight may see it at a greater depth. However, it is an inexpensive and straightforward method of measuring water clarity. Because of the potential for variation between users, methods should be standardized as much as possible.

A Secchi disk measurement should always be taken off the shady side of a boat or dock between 9:00 and 15:00. The period for best results is between 10:00 and 14:00. The same observer should take Secchi depth measurements, in the same manner, every time. One can approach the measurement by lowering the disk beyond a point of disappearance, then raising it and lowering it slightly to set the Secchi depth. Another method is to record the depth at which the disk disappears, lower it another few feet, then record the depth at which the disk reappears as it is slowly brought up. The Secchi depth is taken as the average of the two values.

Secchi disk measurements do not indicate how attenuation changes with depth or particular wavelengths of light. Submarine photometers can operate at depths of and can record visible, ultraviolet, and infrared parts of the spectrum. Turbidimeters and Transmissometers have their own light sources and can measure transparency with scientific accuracy.

==Applications==
Secchi disk measurements have been an integral component of Minnesota&#x27;s and Wisconsin&#x27;s lake water quality assessment programs for some time; lake residents make periodic measurements and submit their readings to state and local agencies. The aggregated longitudinal data are used to reveal general trends in water quality. Similarly, the Indiana Clean Lakes Program trains and relies on volunteers to monitor turbidity in over 80 Indiana lakes using Secchi disks, and uses data submitted by volunteers to monitor lake quality in the state.

In 2013, a team of marine scientists established the global citizen science Secchi Disk program for seafarers to study marine phytoplankton. This ongoing citizen science Secchi Disk study combines the traditional plain white, 30 cm diameter marine Secchi Disk with mobile technology to upload Secchi depth data collected from the sea to a central database. The study&#x27;s first scientific results were published in 2017. The Secchi Disk study was begun in response to a controversial scientific report that suggested the phytoplankton that influences water transparency had declined by 40% in the oceans between the years 1950 and 2008.

<doc id="291069" wikidata="Q1759953" url="?curid=291069" title="Helical scan">
<text>Helical scan is a method of recording high-frequency signals on magnetic tape, used in open-reel video tape recorders, video cassette recorders, digital audio tape recorders, and some computer tape drives. 

With this technique, magnetic tape heads (or head chips) are placed on a rotating head drum, which moves the chips at high speed by due to its high angular velocity. The speed of the head chips must be higher than the linear speed of the tape. The tape is wrapped tightly around the drum. The drum and/or the tape is tilted at an angle that allows the head chips to read the tape diagonally. The linear speed of the tape is slower than the speed of the head chips, allowing high frequency signals to be read or recorded, such as video. As the tape moves linearly or length-wise, the head chips move across the width of the tape in a diagonal path. Due to geometry, this allows for high head chip speeds, known as writing speeds, to be achieved in spite of the low linear speed of the tape. The high writing speed allows for high frequency signals to be recorded. As each head chip enters into contact with the tape, it creates or reads long and narrow areas with information recorded magnetically known as tracks. In Helical scan, these tracks are positioned diagonally, relative to the length of the tape. The diagonal tracks read or written using this method are known as helical tracks.

== Types ==
There are several types of helical scan. These include:
* Alpha wrap (α), in which the tape is wrapped around the drum in a full, 360 degree fashion. 
* Omega wrap (Ω), in which the tape is wrapped almost fully around the drum similar to the Greek letter Omega. Used in Type-C videotape recorders. The tape is wrapped 346 degrees around the drum with 270 degrees used for recording. Because of this, the vertical blanking interval of the video signal is lost and to prevent this a secondary head in a &quot;1 1/2 head&quot; configuration must record the interval when the video head is not reading the tape. A full frame of video with two fields can be recorded in a single revolution of the drum with a single head creating a single diagonal track on the tape. 
*C wrap, where the tape is wrapped around the head drum in the shape of a backwards C, used in the Betacam format, uses a wrap of 200 to 300 degrees where 180 to 270 degrees are active or used for recording, similar to the U wrap which is reminiscent of an U laid on its side and is used in the U-matic format. Because the tape is not wrapped around the drum as much as with the omega wrap, two heads creating two diagonal tracks must be used to record a video frame, one field for every track and head.
*M wrap, used in VHS and the D-1 (Sony) and D-2 (video) digital videotape formats, wraps the tape around the head drum in a pattern or in a tape path reminiscent of the letter M, around the left and right side of the head drum, 250 to 300 degrees around it where 180 to 270 degrees are active or used for recording, with two heads if 180 degrees are used.
* Half wrap, used to denominate any type of wrap where the tape covers approximately 180 degrees, or half of the circumference of the drum. To record a full frame of video it requires at least two video heads, each recording a video field, of which two are necessary to record a video frame.

Many helical scan cassette formats such as VHS and Betacam use a head drum with heads that use azimuth recording, in which the heads in the head drum have a gap that is tilted at an angle, and opposing heads have their gaps tilted so as to oppose each other. This eliminates the need for guard bands between the helical tracks allowing for a higher density of information on the tape.

==History==
Earl Edgar Masterson from RCA patented the first helical scan method in 1950. German engineer Eduard Schüller developed a helical scan method of recording in 1953 while working at AEG. With the advent of television broadcasting in Japan in the early 1950s, they saw the need for magnetic television signal recording. Dr. Kenichi Sawazaki developed a prototype helical scan recorder in 1954. Helical scan machines were demonstrated by Toshiba in 1959 and since they recorded one field of video per track, they were the first to allow video to be paused and played back at speeds other than real time. Helical scan type B and type C videotape began to be used in 1976.

<text>Heiner Geißler (3 March 1930 – 12 September 2017) was a German politician with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party and a federal minister from 1982 to 1985.

== Career ==
Born Heinrichjosef Georg Geißler in Gleisweiler, he studied law and philosophy in Munich and Tübingen, where he graduated in 1960.

From 1967 to June 1977, Geißler was minister of the state government of Rhineland-Palatine, serving prime ministers Peter Altmeier, Helmut Kohl and Bernhard Vogel. During that time, he implemented the first law concerning kindergartens, and introduced the state&#x27;s first welfare stations.

From 1982 to 1985 Geißler served as federal minister, heading the Bundesministerium für Jugend, Familie und Gesundheit (youth, family, and health) for Chancellor Kohl. It was during this period that said federal ministry was alerted to the Austrian wine scandal in 1985.

From 1977 to 1989, Geißler was Secretary General of the CDU under the leadership of Kohl, shaping strategy and running election campaigns. He was widely regarded as a principal architect of Kohl&#x27;s rise to the chancellorship in 1982. In the following years, he kept the party on a centrist track, hoping to attract moderate voters among the opposition Social Democrats alarmed by the gains of the Republicans and the environmentalist Green Party.

Despite becoming a major figure in the CDU, differing and increasingly left-leaning views eventually strained relations with Kohl. Reports that Geißler would be replaced cropped up after the Christian Democrats lost elections in West Berlin and Frankfurt in 1989 and polled only 37.6 percent in the European elections that year, a drop of 8.2 percentage points from the 1984 elections. In late 1989, he joined forces with Kurt Biedenkopf, Lothar Späth, Rita Süssmuth and others in an unsuccessful effort to oust Kohl as CDU chairman. Geißler was subsequently forced to resign as secretary general.

Geißler remained a member of the Bundestag until 2002 as a member of parliament for his home state Rhineland-Palatinate. From 1991 until 1998, he served as deputy chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group under the leadership of chairman Wolfgang Schäuble.

In addition to his parliamentary work, Geißler also served as Vice-President of the Christian Democrat and People&#x27;s Parties International from 1986 until 1993.

Geißler later became a sought-after arbitrator in wage and other disputes.

== Political positions ==
During the 1991 parliamentary vote to move the seat of federal government from Bonn to Berlin, the country&#x27;s historic capital, Geißler proposed a two-city capital as a compromise.

From being a conservative right-winger until the early 1990s, he also became increasingly leftist in his views as far as social policy and globalization are concerned. In 2007, he announced he had become a member of the attac network. This happened weeks before the 2007 G8 summit, which Germany, holding the 2007 G8 presidency, was hosting. Geißler himself said that his joining of attac had to be seen in the context of the upcoming G8 summit.

== Other activities ==
* Aktion Courage, Chairman (2002–2005)
* Barmenia Versicherungen, Member of the Advisory Board

== Personal life ==

Geißler was married and had three children. Since 1980 he lived in Gleisweiler. He died on 11 September 2017, aged 87.

<text>Legio I Adiutrix ( First Legion &quot;Rescuer&quot;), was a legion of the Imperial Roman army founded in AD 68, probably by Nero or Galba when he rebelled against emperor Nero (r. 54–68). The last record mentioning the &quot;Adiutrix&quot; is in 344, when it was stationed at Brigetio (modern Szőny), in the Roman province of Pannonia. The emblem of the legion was a capricorn, used along with the winged horse Pegasus, on the helmets the symbol used by I &quot;Adiutrix&quot; legionaries was a dolphin.

==Origins==
The legion probably was founded by Nero, although some sources provide that it was Galba. Some theories propose the idea that Nero began to recruit marines from the Misenum navy, and Galba likely was responsible for the last stages of the organization, when sacrifices were made, and the legion received its aquila standard. Some children may have been among the first recruits.

== Year of the Four Emperors ==
In the confusing Year of the Four Emperors, the legion fought in Otho&#x27;s army in the Battle of Bedriacum, where this emperor was defeated by Vitellius The victorious Vitellius ordered the legion transferred to Spain, but by the year 70 it was fighting in the Batavian rebellion.
==Stationed in Moguntiacum==
The city of Moguntiacum (Mainz) is the legion&#x27;s first known base camp, shared with Legio XIV &quot;Gemina&quot;, where they attended mainly building activities. In 83, they fought the &quot;Germanic wars&quot; against the Chatti, a German tribe living across the Rhine, under the command of Emperor Domitian. After that they were transferred to the Danubian army stationed in the Roman province of Pannonia, to fight the Dacians.

==Legio I Adiutrix Pia Fidelis==
Following the murder of Domitian in 96, the &quot;Adiutrix&quot;, along with the Danubian army, played an important role in Roman politics, forcing Nerva to adopt Trajan as his successor. When Trajan became emperor, he gave the legion the cognomen Pia Fidelis (&quot;loyal and faithful&quot;) to acknowledge their support. Between 101 and 106, under the new emperor&#x27;s command, I &quot;Adiutrix&quot;, along with IV &quot;Flavia Felix&quot; and XIII &quot;Gemina&quot;, conquered Dacia and occupied the newly formed province. Trajan also used his &quot;Pia Fidelis&quot; in the campaign against Parthia (115–117), but they were sent back to Pannonia by his successor emperor Hadrian, with base in Brigetio.

During the next decades, I &quot;Adiutrix&quot; remained in the Danube frontier. Under Marcus Aurelius, I &quot;Adiutrix&quot; fought the war against Marcomanni commanded by Marcus Valerius Maximianus. Between 171 and 175, the commander was Pertinax, emperor for a brief period in 193. When Septimius Severus became emperor, I &quot;Adiutrix&quot; was among his supporters, following him in the march for Rome.

In the next decades, the main base was again Pannonia, but they played a part in several Parthian wars, namely the campaigns of 195 and 197–198 of Septimius Severus, 215–217 led by Caracalla and 244 by Gordian III.

It (probably vexilationes of it) took part in the battle of Mediolanum.

The legion received the cognomen Pia Fidelis Bis (&quot;twice loyal and faithful&quot;) and Constans (&quot;reliable&quot;), sometime in the 3rd century.

<text>Legio I Germanica, ( First Legion &quot;Germanic&quot;), was a legion of the Imperial Roman army, possibly founded in 48 BC by Julius Caesar to fight for him in the civil war against Pompey. The title &quot;germanic&quot; is a reference to its service in the Germanic Wars, rather than the place of origin of its soldiers. After the Revolt of the Batavi (AD 70), the remaining men of the &quot;Germanica&quot; were added to Galba&#x27;s seventh legion, which became VII &quot;Gemina&quot;. The emblem of Legio I is unknown, but it was probably Taurus, like all the other legions levied by Caesar (except the V &quot;Alaudae&quot;).

==Origin==
There are three theories about I &quot;Germanica&quot; recruitment. The most favored is that it was raised by Julius Caesar in 48 BC to fight in the civil war against Pompey. The Legion first saw action at the Battle of Dyrracchium. In that case it would have fought in the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC. Another claim is that the legion was raised by Pompey and it fought against Caesar at Pharsalus, Thaspus, and Munda.

The third theory attributes its recruitment to Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus, a partisan of Caesar, who died in the Battle of Forum Gallorum against Mark Antony in 43 BC. Legio I would have been recruited in that year for that campaign.

However recruited, Legio I was inherited by Augustus and therefore ought to have been entitled to the &quot;cognomen&quot; &quot;Augusta&quot; after distinguished service under his eyes; however, there was no Legio I Augusta. That title was stripped after a defeat in the Cantabrian wars and the loss of its standard to the Astur and Cantabrian peoples.

The legion would fight against Sextus Pompey in Sicilly in 36 BCE. After Augustus lost a battle, he requested the Legio I Germanica as reinforcements.

==Hispania disgrace==
After the civil war the legion joined the army of Augustus. It is believed to be identical to the Legio I that took part in the Hispania campaign against the Cantabri conducted for Augustus by Marcus Agrippa and was disgraced there. Inscriptions on coins from Hispania indicate that between 30 and 16 BC, some Legio I was stationed in Hispania Tarraconensis, where they would have fought in the war against the Cantabrians and Asturians. Dio Cassius (54.11.5) says that one legion was stripped of its title, Augusta, after suffering reverses in that campaign. The two references are believed to be to the same legion, accounting for its early missing title and emblem. While in Spain they helped build the colonia Acci.

==Distinguished service in Germania==
Around the turn of the century, Legio I appears on the Rhine frontier. They may have been moved to the Rhine in order to help emperor Tiberius&#x27;s war against the Vindelicia. The &quot;Annales&quot; of Tacitus state that they received standards from Tiberius, but when that was is not clear. This statement is problematic because only new or reconstituted legions received standards. Other theories suggest they received the standard after winning a battle near Lake Constance. Because of their service in Germania the legion soon redeemed itself, winning the title &quot;Germanica&quot; for it. Exactly when they won it is not known. Most likely, the title &quot;Germanica&quot; was granted for service in Drusus&#x27; subsequent punitive and exploratory campaigns against the Germanic tribes. Drusus was extremely popular. It was an honor to be in his service and he made sure that his men were honored properly.

==Mutiny on the Limes Germanicus==

After the defeat of Varus, Augustus&#x27; adoptive son Tiberius (brother of Drusus) assumed command of the army on the Rhine, which was reinforced to eight legions. When Tiberius returned to Italy in 13 AD, Augustus appointed Drusus&#x27; son, Germanicus, commander of the eight legions on the Rhine. In the following year Augustus died, Tiberius being his successor.

Subsequently Junius Blaesus, commander of three legions in summer camp in Pannonia, gave the men a holiday. A soldier who had been a claqueur, Percennius, addressed the men on that occasion on the subject of soldier&#x27;s benefits. They needed a fixed contract, he said, a term of service of 16 seasons instead of 25 or 30, and a pay raise. The speech was far from comic. The men as he spoke began raise a dais of earth around him and brought the standards and that attracted the attention of the Praetor, Blaesus. Unable to dissuade the men, he agreed to send his son, a tribune, to Tiberius with the demands. The men settled down to await the reply.

Word of the mutiny spread to construction crews of the legions in nearby Nauportus. Arresting their commander, Aufidienus Rufus, they forced him to march at the head of the return column carrying heavy baggage and asking him all the while how he liked it. They plundered &quot;vici&quot; as they went. Arriving in camp they raised a riot. Attempting to quell it, Blaesus had loyal troops throw the rioters in the guardhouse, but they were set free, the tribunes were ejected from camp, and a harsh centurion murdered.

The soldiers were on the point of killing each other when Tiberius&#x27; own son, Drusus Julius Caesar arrived in camp with some troops, sealed the gates and proceeded to investigate and settle the mutiny in tribunal. The men rejecting his proposals, he sent them to their tents and sent men to speak to them personally. Gradually the men were recalled to duty. Drusus had the leaders executed and returned to Rome. No action yet was taken on the issues.

The XXI &quot;Rapax&quot;, V &quot;Alaudae&quot;, I &quot;Germanica&quot; and XX &quot;Valeria Victrix&quot; of the army of &quot;Germania Inferior&quot; heard of the mutiny at their summer camp among the Ubii. Aroused by new recruits from the city of Rome, the men attacked the centurions by surprise, beating many to death and throwing the bodies into the Rhine. The main command was isolated and the men ran the camp. Hearing of the mutiny, Germanicus left his tax-collecting duties in Gaul and hastened to the camp with a small retinue. He was just as popular as his father had been.

After mingling with the men and hearing their complaints, Germanicus persuaded them into formation, had the standards brought out and began a dialogue with them. At one point they bared their backs to show Germanicus the scars from lashing. At another Germanicus drew his sword and offered to commit suicide, but was restrained. Another soldier offered him a sharper sword. He withdrew to his tent.

There he received word that the mutiny was about to become a state issue. Mutinous envoys were being sent to Cologne, there were plans to burn the city and sack Gaul. The enemy on the other side of the border was watching with interest, waiting to intervene. In realization of the common danger the men settled for immunity, double pay (which Germanicus gladly paid from his own funds on the spot) and an enlistment of sixteen years. I &quot;Germanica&quot; and the XX &quot;Valeria Victrix&quot; retired to Cologne, while Germanicus went to seek senatorial confirmation and approval by Tiberius.

Germanicus returned to Cologne with envoys from the Senate, arriving at night, which was misinterpreted by the men as signifying the agreement was off. They dragged Germanicus from his bed, but the matter was clarified next day. Upset, Germanicus tried to send his pregnant wife and young son off to safety, but the soldiers heard them weeping and came out to detain them. Aroused, Germanicus delivered one of the great orations in history, upholding the tradition of his family&#x27;s ability in that area, saying, for example:

:&quot;For what have you not dared, what have you not profaned during these days? What name shall I give to this gathering? Am I to call you soldiers ... when you have trampled under foot the Authority of the Senate? ...&quot; (&quot;Annales&quot; 1.46 from the Perseus site)

Moved and stung to the quick, the soldiers settled the mutiny on the spot by general court martial conducted by the tribunes. The leaders were put in chains and brought to the dais, where they went before the troops one by one. The soldiers voted for guilt or innocence by voice. The guilty were thrown off the dais to be executed by the men. Each centurion then passed before the tribunal to be approved or disapproved. The approved kept their rank. The disapproved were discharged from the service. The terms of the agreement were faithfully kept. Germanicus returned to Rome.

I &quot;Germanica&quot; went back to duty, but not exactly with honor. It remained in Germania Inferior fighting in all the major campaigns along the Rhine and the Danube.

After the dissolution of the Cologne fortress the legion was moved to Bonn.

== Gaius Julius Vindex&#x27;s revolt against Nero ==
During the year 67 AD emperor Nero&#x27;s position as emperor became unstable. Many senators became discontent with him, and a number of governors discussed his removal. Two of these politicians were Lucius Clodius Macer, governor of Africa and Gaius Julius Vindex, governor of Gallia Lugdunensis. When the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, Servius Sulpicius Galba, rebelled against Nero, both of them supported him. The Legio I Germanica supported Nero. They defeated Gaius Julius Vindex. However, Galba still became the emperor. Afterwards the Legio I Germanica proclaimed Vitellius, the governor of Germania Inferior as emperor. Vitellius would become emperor. Later he would be deposed by Vespasian.

==Final disgrace and disbandment==
During the Batavian revolt a Roman expedition was defeated near Nijmegen, and shortly after, two legions were besieged at Xanten. Although the Legio I Germanica, led by Herennius Gallus, XVI Gallica and a legion from Germania Superior, XXII Primigenia, attempted to reinforce them, they were made to surrender in March 70. The two legions who had made an abortive rescue attempt, I Germanica and XVI Gallica later surrendered as well.

It would be several months before emperor Vespasian could muster a strong force, led by Quintus Petillius Cerialis, to restore control over the Rhineland and subdue the Batavian revolt. In the wake of this, the remains of I Germanica were combined with Legio VII Galbiana to become the VII Gemina. The legion was probably disbanded in the year 70.

<text>Legio XXI Rapax (&quot;Predator, Twenty-First Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. The symbol of the legion is thought to have been a capricorn.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
It was founded in 31 BC by the emperor Augustus (), probably from men previously enlisted in other legions.

Augustus probably sent his new XXIst legion to Hispania Tarraconensis to fight the campaign against the Cantabrians. XXI &quot;Rapax&quot; was one of the five legions used by Drusus to suppress the rebellion of the Raetians, in 16–15 BC. From 15 BC, the legion was stationed in &quot;Castra Regina&quot; (Regensburg), in the new province of Raetia.

=== After Teutoburg ===
After the disaster of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, the legion was sent as reinforcements to Germania Inferior, where they shared the base camp of &quot;Castra Vetera&quot; (Xanten) with V &quot;Alaudae&quot;. Both Legio V and Legio XXI were involved in a mutiny in AD 14. In 43, they were relocated in &quot;Vindonissa&quot; (Windisch), in the province of Germania Superior.

The legion occupied Vindonissa from 46 to 69 with two auxiliary cohorts, first the III &quot;Hispanorum&quot; and VI &quot;Raetorum&quot;, and later the VII &quot;Raetorum equitata&quot; and the XXVI &quot;voluntariorum civium Romanorum&quot;.

Along with the rest of the German border army, the XXI &quot;Rapax&quot; supported its commander, Vitellius, in the Year of the Four Emperors (69) and defeated Othonian forces at the First Battle of Bedriacum. Vitellius was, however, defeated by Vespasian before the end of the year.

In 70, the legion was part of the army sent to deal with the Batavian rebellion and relieve the four legions imprisoned by Civilis. After that they were sent to Germania Superior, where they shared the &quot;castrum&quot; (camp) of &quot;Moguntiacum&quot; (modern day Mainz) with XIV &quot;Gemina&quot;.

In 89, the legions in Moguntiacum supported their commander, Lucius Antonius Saturninus, in his revolt against emperor Domitian. After the end of this unsuccessful insurrection, the legions were separated and XXI &quot;Rapax&quot; sent to Pannonia.

=== Destruction ===
In spring of 92, several tribes (probably Marcomanni, Quadi, Jazyges) crossed the Danube and attacked Pannonia, probably destroying XXI &quot;Rapax&quot;. These tribes would be defeated from May to December 92, and chased back over the river. The Romans did not pursue the retreating tribes.

<text>The Football Association Community Shield (formerly the Charity Shield) is English football&#x27;s annual match contested at Wembley Stadium between the champions of the previous Premier League season and the holders of the FA Cup. If the Premier League champions also won the FA Cup, then the league runners-up provide the opposition. The fixture is recognised as a competitive super cup by the Football Association and UEFA.

Organised by the FA, proceeds from the game are distributed to community initiatives and charities around the country. Revenue from the gate receipts and match programme sales is distributed to the 124 clubs who competed in the FA Cup from the first round onwards, for onward distribution to charities and projects of their choice, while the remainder is distributed to the FA&#x27;s national charity partners. The fixture was first played in the 1908–09 season, replacing the Sheriff of London Charity Shield.

The current holders are 2023–24 Premier League champions Manchester City, who beat 2023–24 FA Cup winners Manchester United 7–6 on penalties after a 1–1 draw in the 2024 fixture.

==History==
The Community Shield evolved from the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, which was introduced in 1898 as a professionals vs amateurs cup (the gentlemen and players tradition). The Football Association Charity Shield, as it was known at the time, was designed to replace the Sheriff of London Charity Shield after the leading amateur clubs fell out with the FA. The new format was to have the Football League First Division champions play the Southern League champions, and the first match was in 1908 between Manchester United (the First Division champions) and Queens Park Rangers (the Southern League champions). The match was drawn 1–1, so the game was replayed when Manchester United won 4–0. This is the only Charity Shield game to go to a replay. Both games were played at Stamford Bridge.

The competition format varied over the years: in 1913 the Shield was contested between Amateurs and Professionals XIs, while in 1921 the Shield was contested between the Football League and FA Cup winners for the first time. The format continued to vary in the 1920s, usually along the lines of Amateurs vs Professionals, including one year (1927) where the Professionals were represented by the FA Cup holders Cardiff City and the Amateurs by the Corinthians, echoing the format of the trophy&#x27;s predecessor, the Sheriff of London Charity Shield.

In 1930, the match returned to being contested by the winners of the Football League and the FA Cup, and with a few exceptions, that format has remained to the present day. Notable exceptions include the 1950 Shield, which involved the England World Cup team against an FA team that had toured Canada that summer, and the 1961 Shield, when Tottenham Hotspur became the first team of the 20th century to win the Double, and so played a Football Association XI.

The game was moved to the start of the season from 1959 onwards. The question of which two teams should contest the Shield should one team win both the FA Cup and League continued to linger. In 1971, Arsenal became the second team to win the Double since the Shield&#x27;s foundation, but owing to their previously arranged pre-season friendly matches, they could not take part. Leicester City were invited as Division Two champions to play FA Cup runners-up Liverpool instead and went on to win the trophy, despite at the time having never won either the League or the FA Cup.

In 1972, league champions Derby County and FA Cup winners Leeds United both declined to take part in the Charity Shield, so Manchester City, who had finished in fourth in the First Division, and Third Division champions Aston Villa were invited to take part; Manchester City won 1–0. 
After league champions Liverpool and FA Cup winners Sunderland declined to play, despite finishing the season 11th in the league City also contested the 1973 Charity Shield but lost 1–0 to Second Division champions Burnley.

In 1974, the then FA secretary, Ted Croker, created the current format with the match being played at Wembley Stadium, and being contested by the reigning League and FA Cup holders.

Between 1949 and 1991, the Shield was shared on 11 occasions, after the matches ended in a draw. Four drawn games in the 1980s and early 1990s resulted in each team holding the trophy for six months, but in 1993 penalties were re-introduced to decide drawn games.

With the formation of a new top league, the FA Premier League, the Shield became a showcase match between the Premier League and FA Cup winners from the 1993 competition onwards.

In 2002, the Charity Commission found that the Football Association had failed to meet its legal obligations under charity law, by failing to specify what money from ticket sales went to charity, and delaying payments to the charities nominated. As a result, the competition was renamed the Community Shield. Arsenal were the first winners of the renamed Community Shield with a 1–0 victory over Liverpool.

In 2016, the FA&#x27;s official silversmith Thomas Lyte restored and rebuilt the Football Association&#x27;s original 1908 Charity Shield to mark 50 years since England beat West Germany in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The trophy was sold at auction, raising £40,000 for the Bobby Moore Fund for Cancer Research UK. The Bobby Moore Fund became the FA&#x27;s charity partner in July 2016. The auction was held at The Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington, where the England team celebrated the 1966 victory.

==Rules==
The rules of the Community Shield are generally the same as those of the Premier League, with a team of 11 starting players and 7 substitutes. However, unlike in most other competitions where only five substitutions are permitted, teams in the Community Shield are permitted up to six substitutions. If the scores are level after 90 minutes, the teams play a penalty shootout. If a team wins both the Premier League and the FA Cup, the runners-up from the Premier League will be the opposition.

==Status==
Serving as England&#x27;s super cup between the previous season&#x27;s Premier League champions and FA Cup winners, the Community Shield is regarded as the &quot;curtain-raiser&quot; and is the first competitive game of each top-flight English football season. However, it has been treated with varying degrees of seriousness by participating teams, with some using it similarly to friendlies in their pre-season schedule – as an opportunity to give match practice to fringe members of their squads or those returning from injury. BBC Sport pundit Mark Lawrenson and &quot;The Guardian&quot; writer Tom Bryant both described the match as a &quot;glorified friendly&quot;. Prior to the 2008 FA Community Shield, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson summarised his opinion of the competition: &quot;The Community Shield is a prestigious match but I have used players in it who were not quite fit... it&#x27;s always a game we never quite use as a do or die thing; we use it as a barometer for fitness&quot;.

Others, however, continue to recognise the status of the match as the first official game and trophy of the domestic season. Ahead of the 2016 FA Community Shield against Manchester United, Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri asked, &quot;Why do you say this question, a friendly? When is the Community Shield a friendly? Of course we will be at the maximum and Manchester United will be at their maximum. The two teams want to win. I am very excited.&quot; The following year, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte affirmed the significance of the cup, stating &quot;It is not a friendly game. It is an official game and there is a trophy so for us it must be important&quot; ahead of his side&#x27;s clash with Arsenal. Likewise in 2018, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola referred to his side&#x27;s clash with Chelsea in the competition as &quot;the first final&quot; of the season. Prior to the 2023 match, Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta affirmed the status of the Community Shield when speaking to the official matchday programme, stating &quot;We&#x27;re proud to be playing in the FA Community Shield here at Wembley Stadium. This is a match which recognises two clubs who had a good year, with a traditional place in our football calendar at the start of the new season.

The FA classifies the Community Shield as a friendly match for disciplinary purposes.

==Records==
* The most successful teams in the competition are Manchester United (17 outright wins, 4 shared), Arsenal (16 outright wins, 1 shared), Liverpool (11 outright wins, 5 shared) and Everton (8 outright wins, 1 shared).
* Chelsea (2010, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2018) and Newcastle United (1932, 1951, 1952, 1955 and 1996) share the joint-longest run of appearances without winning or sharing the trophy.
* The highest scoring game was Manchester United&#x27;s 8–4 win against Swindon Town in 1911.
* Everton hold the record for most consecutive wins (4) from 1984 to 1987; however, the 1986 &#x27;win&#x27; was shared with Liverpool. Manchester United hold the record for most consecutive losses (4) from 1998 to 2001. During this period Manchester United also held the record for most consecutive games played (6) from 1996 to 2001 in which they won 2.
* Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Pat Jennings scored against Manchester United from his own penalty area in the 1967 Charity Shield, which was shared at 3–3.
* Brighton &amp; Hove Albion are the only club to win just the Shield (in 1910), never the FA Cup or the League. In the five years that the Charity Shield was contested by the winners of the Football League and Southern League between 1908 and 1912, this was the only occasion on which the Southern League champions prevailed. The victory remains Brighton&#x27;s only national honour to date and they were crowned the &#x27;Champions of all England&#x27;.

==Venues==

For purposes of clarity, venues mentioned in &quot;italics&quot; in this section no longer exist.

===Permanent venues===
Since 1974, the Community Shield has been at a permanent home rather than guest venues. 
*&quot;Old Wembley Stadium&quot;: 1974–2000
*Millennium Stadium: 2001–2006
*New Wembley Stadium: 2007–2011, 2013–2021, 2023–present

===Neutral and guest host venues===
The fixture was originally played at various neutral grounds or at the home ground of one of the competing teams. In total, there have been eighteen host grounds other than the aforementioned permanent three. The first ground to host the fixture was Stamford Bridge in 1908 and the last ground that guest hosted the fixture was the King Power Stadium in 2022, which was due to Wembley hosting the final of UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022 on the following day.

Seven grounds have hosted the fixture once: St James&#x27; Park in 1932, Roker Park in 1936, Burnden Park in 1958, Turf Moor in 1960, Portman Road in 1962, Anfield in 1964 and Elland Road in 1969. Leicester City have hosted the fixture twice, at Filbert Street in 1971 and the King Power Stadium in 2022. A further nine grounds have hosted the fixture on multiple occasions (see table).

<doc id="291076" wikidata="Q2389679" url="?curid=291076" title="Self-clocking signal">
<text>In telecommunications and electronics, a self-clocking signal is one that can be decoded without the need for a separate clock signal or other source of synchronization. This is usually done by including embedded synchronization information within the signal, and adding constraints on the coding of the data payload such that false synchronization can easily be detected.

Most line codes are designed to be self-clocking.

==Isochronicity and anisochronicity==
If a clock signal is embedded in the data transmission, there are two possibilities: the clock signals are sent at the same time as the data (isochronous), or at a different time (anisochronous).

===Isochronous self-clocking signals===
If the embedded clock signal is isochronous, it gets sent simultaneously with the data. Below is an example signal, in this case using the Manchester code self-clocking signal. The data and clock cycles can be thought of as &quot;adding up&quot; to a combination, where both the clock cycle and the data can be retrieved from the transmitted signal.

===Asynchronous self-clocking signals===
Asynchronous self-clocking signals do not combine clock cycles and data transfer into one continuous signal. Instead, the transmission of clock cycles and data transmission is modulated. Below is an example signal used in asynchronous serial communication, where it is made clear that the information about the clock speed is transmitted in a different timeframe than the actual data.

==Implementations==
Example uses of self-clocking signal protocols include:
*Isochronous
**Manchester code, where the clock signals occur at the transition points.
**Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy signals
**Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation
**4B5B
**8b/10b encoding
**64b/66b encoding
**HDLC
**Modified Frequency Modulation
*Anisochronous
**Morse code
**Asynchronous start-stop

Most of these codes can be seen as a kind of Run Length Limited code. Those constraints on &quot;runs&quot; of zeros and &quot;runs&quot; of ones ensure that transitions occur often enough to keep the receiver synchronized.

Such self-clocking signals can be decoded correctly into a stream of bits without bit slip.
To further decode that stream of bits and decide which bit is the first bit of a byte, often a self-synchronizing code is used.

== Analog examples ==
Amplitude modulation – modulating a signal formula_1 by changing the amplitude of a carrier wave, as in:
:formula_2
is self-clocking, as the zero crossings serve as a clock pulse.

One may consider this clock pulse redundant information, or at least a wasteful use of channel capacity, and duplex the channel by varying the phase, as in polar modulation, or adding another signal that is 90° out of phase (a sine wave), as in quadrature modulation. The result is to send twice as many signals over the channel, at the cost of losing the clock, and thus suffering signal degradation in case of clock drift (the analog equivalent of bit drift).

This demonstrates how encoding clocking or synchronization in a code costs channel capacity, and illustrates the trade-off.

<text>The Scottish Constitutional Convention (SCC) was an association of Scottish political parties, churches and other civic groups, that developed a framework for Scottish devolution. 

== History ==

=== Campaign for a Scottish Assembly ===

The Convention has its roots in the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly (CSA), which was formed in the aftermath of the 1979 referendum that failed to establish a devolved Scottish Assembly. The all-party Campaign for a Scottish Assembly, which was launched at a rally in Edinburgh on 1st March 1980, was led by Jack Brand, and later headed by Jim Boyack. By July, a Labour Campaign for a Scottish Assembly had been established to build support in the party at constituency level and exert influence at the party conference. The CSA contained individuals committed to some form of Home Rule for Scotland. Activists were drawn from the Labour Party, the Scottish National Party (SNP), the Scottish Liberal Party, the Scottish Ecology Party, the Communist Party and the trade union movement. Some were formerly members of the Scottish Labour Party (SLP).

The CSA kept up the pressure for devolution in the early years of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, which was totally opposed to any form of Home Rule. Eventually, the CSA came to the stance that the cause of Scottish devolution would be best served by a convention with more democratic legitimacy invested in it.

The CSA organised the committee, chaired by Professor Sir Robert Grieve, that published the Claim of Right for Scotland. The Claim held that it was the Scottish people&#x27;s right to choose the form of government that best suited them (a long-established principle, first formally stated in the Declaration of Arbroath, 1320 ), and which also recommended the establishment of a convention to discuss this.

=== Scottish Constitutional Convention ===

The Scottish Constitutional Convention was then established in 1989 after prominent Scottish individuals signed the Claim of Right, and superseded the role of the CSA.

The first meeting was held in the Assembly Hall in Edinburgh on 30 March 1989. Canon Kenyon Wright, the convener of the executive committee, opened the meeting. David Steel and Harry Ewing were adopted as co-chairmen. A second meeting on 7 July was held in Inverness. Various organisations participated in the Convention, such as the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Green Party, the Communist Party, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, the Small Business Federation and various bodies representing other strands of political opinion as well as civic society in general. Representatives of the two largest churches – the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church – were involved, as well as smaller church groups, and some non-Christian communities which decided to participate.

Initially, the Scottish National Party (SNP) participated, but the then party leader Gordon Wilson, along with Jim Sillars, decided to withdraw the SNP from participation owing to the convention&#x27;s unwillingness to discuss Scottish independence as a constitutional option.

The Conservative government of the day was very hostile to the convention, and challenged the local authorities&#x27; right to finance the convention, although the courts found that they were in fact entitled to do so.

Under its executive chairman, Canon Kenyon Wright, the convention published its blueprint for devolution, &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Parliament, Scotland&#x27;s Right&quot;, on 30 November 1995, Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day. The report had proposals for a devolved arrangement.

In December 2013, John McAllion, who participated in the convention as a Labour MP, claimed that it was &quot;self-appointed&quot;, &quot;elitist&quot;, and &quot;ultimately unrepresentative&quot; of Scottish society, and should not be a model for a future constitutional convention.

<doc id="291093" wikidata="Q1823907" url="?curid=291093" title="Walter Mitty">
<text>Walter Jackson Mitty is a fictional character in James Thurber&#x27;s first short story &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,&quot; first published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on March 18, 1939, and in book form in &quot;My World—and Welcome to It&quot; in 1942.

Thurber loosely based the character, a daydreamer, on himself. It was made into a film in 1947 starring Danny Kaye, with a remake in 2013 directed by, and starring Ben Stiller.

== Character and plot ==
Mitty is a meek, mild-mannered man with a vivid fantasy life. In a few dozen paragraphs, he imagines himself a wartime pilot, an emergency-room surgeon, and a devil-may-care killer. Although the story has humorous elements, there is a darker and more significant message underlying the text, leading to a more tragic interpretation of the Mitty character. Even in his heroic daydreams, Mitty does not triumph, several fantasies being interrupted before the final one sees Mitty dying bravely in front of a firing squad. In the brief snatches of reality that punctuate Mitty&#x27;s fantasies, the reader meets well-meaning but insensitive strangers who inadvertently rob Mitty of some of his remaining dignity.

== Popular culture ==

The character&#x27;s name has come into more general use to refer to an ineffectual dreamer and appears in several dictionaries. &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary&quot; defines a Walter Mitty as &quot;an ordinary, often ineffectual person who indulges in fantastic daydreams of personal triumphs&quot;. The most famous of Thurber&#x27;s inept male protagonists, the character is considered &quot;the archetype for dreamy, hapless, Thurber Man&quot;.

When referencing actor Errol Flynn, Warner Brothers studio head, Jack L. Warner, noted in his autobiography, &quot;My First Hundred Years in Hollywood&quot;, &quot;To the Walter Mittys of the world he [Flynn] was all the heroes in one magnificent, sexy, animal package.&quot;

In the song &quot;Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, Ian Dury refers to the clothes of Mr. Walter Mitty as a better alternative to wearing grey, citing the character as an example of the unconventional.

In the December 2, 1963 edition of Newsweek Magazine (and later published as a slim book), Washington Post Editor Ben Bradlee recalled his friend John F. Kennedy in a column and described his, &quot;Walter Mitty streak, as wide as his smile&quot; citing Kennedy on the golf course when he played well as embodying Arnold Palmer&#x27;s power or Julius Boros&#x27; finesse.

The 1969-1970 television series &quot;My World and Welcome to It&quot; is titled after Thurber&#x27;s anthology that contained his Walter Mitty story. The short-lived series won two Emmys.

The character is mentioned in the opening lines of the Mark Lindsay 1970 hit song, &quot;Silver Bird&quot;: &quot;Get aboard the silver bird, departing gate 19/Satisfy your Walter Mitty mind, tryin&#x27; out a dream.&quot;

In his of Henry Kissinger, Walter Isaacson records that on October 6, 1973, during the 1973 Arab Israeli War, Kissinger urged President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Chief of Staff General Alexander Haig to keep Nixon in Florida in order to avoid any &quot;hysterical&quot; moves and to keep any &quot;Walter Mitty tendencies&quot; under control.

In the 1997 book &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; by Jon Krakauer—a personal account of the events of the 1996 Everest disaster—Krakauer states: &quot;Walter Mittys with Everest dreams need to bear in mind that when things go wrong up in the death zone (above 26,000 feet)—and sooner or later they always do—the strongest guides in the world may be powerless to save a client&#x27;s life; indeed as the events of 1996 demonstrated, the strongest guides in the world are sometimes powerless to save even their own lives.&quot;

In the 1999 autobiography &quot;John Glenn: A Memoir by Mercury&quot; by astronaut and US Senator John Glenn, he states, &quot;The average person could Walter Mitty him- or herself into winning the Indianapolis 500, since everybody drove a car; all you had to do was imagine yourself going faster and making nothing but left turns. But space was so new nobody had a way to relate to it realistically.&quot;

In 2007, automaker Ford stated that it had to exclude from the list of potential bidders &quot;Walter Mitty&quot; types who had dreams but no experience, prior to the sale of their Aston Martin British GT car brand to a consortium of business interests from America and the Middle East, headed by Prodrive founder and world rally championship owner David Richards.

Impostor Alan McIlwraith, who falsely claimed to be a knighted war hero, was dubbed &quot;Sir Walter Mitty&quot; by the press.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on April 20, 2009 that a leaked British National Party training manual described some members as &quot;liars, oddballs, and Walter Mitty types&quot;.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on January 23, 2016 that up to 10% of servicemen and ex-servicemen who made use of the services of military psychiatrists for PTSD were &quot;Walter Mitty&quot; characters who fabricated or exaggerated their experiences in combat.

Terry Gilliam described his film &quot;Brazil&quot; as &quot;Walter Mitty meets Franz Kafka&quot;.

In his January 20, 2021 column &quot;Witless Ape Rides Helicopter&quot; in National Review magazine, Kevin D. Williamson criticized the US Republican Party for the legacy of Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency, saying &quot;maybe turning your party over to Generalissimo Walter Mitty, his hideous scheming spawn, and the studio audience from &quot;Hee-Haw&quot; was not just absolutely &quot;aces&quot; as a political strategy.&quot;

=== British military slang ===
Individuals who impersonate serving or retired members of the armed forces are known as &quot;Walts&quot; in the British Armed Forces, a shortened form of &quot;Walter Mitty&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it is an offence under the Armed Forces Act 2006 to wear real or replica military decorations to pretend to be a member of the armed forces.

In his book on selection for the SAS, Andy McNab wrote that soldiers from other units who were applying to join and who gave away the fact they were motivated by reasons of personal vanity were labelled as &quot;Walter Mitties&quot; and quietly sent home.

== Films ==
The character was first played by Danny Kaye in the 1947 film version. Thurber opposed this 1947 production.

A 2013 re-make of the film starred, and was directed by Ben Stiller. This too bore little resemblance to Thurber&#x27;s vision of the character.

== Music ==

Walter Mitty is referenced in the lyrics of these songs:

<doc id="291098" wikidata="Q1055850" url="?curid=291098" title="Derry, New Hampshire">
<text>Derry is a town in Rockingham County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 34,317 at the 2020 census. Although it is a town and not a city, Derry is the most populous community in Rockingham County and the 4th most populous in the state. The town&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Spacetown&quot;, derives from the fact that Derry is the birthplace of Alan Shepard, the first astronaut from the United States in space. Derry was also for a time the home of the poet Robert Frost and his family.

The Derry census-designated place, with a 2020 population of 22,879, occupies the central part of the town, extending from Derry&#x27;s downtown in the west to the town of Hampstead in the east. The town also includes the village of East Derry.

== History ==
The area was first settled by Scots-Irish families in 1719 as part of the town of Londonderry, as were present-day Windham and portions of Manchester, Salem and Hudson. The town of Derry was formed in 1827 from the eastern portion of Londonderry and was named, like Londonderry, after the city of Derry in Ireland, the Irish word &quot;Doire&quot; meaning &quot;oak grove&quot;. The first potato planted in the United States was sown in Derry in the town&#x27;s common field in 1719. The town is the location of two of America&#x27;s oldest private schools, Pinkerton Academy, founded in 1814 and still in operation, and the closed Adams Female Seminary.

Derry was once a linen and leather-making center until New England textile industries moved south in the 20th century. As recently as World War II, Derry was also a sleepy farming community. From 1900 to 1911, poet Robert Frost lived with his family on a farm in Derry purchased for him by his grandfather. The Robert Frost Farm is now a National Historic Landmark and state park and is open to the public for tours, poetry readings and other cultural events from spring through fall.

The post-war suburban boom, the town&#x27;s proximity to Boston in the south and Manchester to the northwest, and the construction of Interstate 93 through town led to a huge population boom. After the 1990s, this growth disappeared, with the population remaining essentially unchanged since 2000.

The Manchester and Lawrence branch of the Boston and Maine Railroad ran through Derry, but is now abandoned, with most of the line in town now a rail trail. The New Hampshire Department of Transportation stated in its I-93 corridor transit study and its 2012 statewide rail plan that it could be feasible to reopen the line.

==Geography==
Derry is in southern New Hampshire, in southwestern Rockingham County. It is southeast of Manchester, the state&#x27;s largest city, and northwest of Lawrence, Massachusetts. The town is crossed by Interstate 93 and New Hampshire routes 28, 28 Bypass, and 102.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.26% of the town. Derry is drained by Beaver Brook, a southward-flowing tributary of the Merrimack River. Island Pond is on the southeastern border of the town and drains to the Spicket River, another tributary of the Merrimack. A small section along the northern border of town drains north to the Exeter River, part of the Piscataqua River watershed. The highest point in the town is Warner Hill, at above sea level, where from the top one can see the Boston skyline on a clear day.

Derry&#x27;s downtown is located near the town&#x27;s western border at the intersection of Routes 102 and 28, and the village of East Derry is located approximately to the east and close to the geographic center of the town. Both areas are part of the Derry census-designated place.

Precipitation is well-spread throughout the year, including snowfall in the winter.

==Demographics==

==Government==
In the New Hampshire Senate, Derry is in the 19th district and is currently represented by Republican Regina Birdsell. On the Executive Council of New Hampshire, Derry is in district 3 and is currently represented by Republican Janet Stevens. In the U.S. House of Representatives, Derry is included in New Hampshire&#x27;s 1st congressional district and is currently represented by Democrat Chris Pappas.

Derry is part of a reliably Republican belt of dense, populous towns along Interstate 93 near the Massachusetts border. Derry leans Republican in presidential elections, and has even trended rightwards as of late. Bill Clinton did manage to carry the town with a plurality of the vote in 1996. No Democrat has won a majority of Derry&#x27;s voters since Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s landslide election in 1964.
==Economy==

===Top employers===
According to the town&#x27;s 2020 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the town are the following:

== Transportation ==
Five New Hampshire state highways and one Interstate Highway cross the town of Derry:

*NH 28 enters from Salem in the south, follows Rockingham Road north to the southern limit of the town&#x27;s main business district, then turns west along with Rockingham Road toward an intersection with Windham Road and Kendall Pond Road (Shute&#x27;s Corner), and then north to follow Birch Street. After crossing NH 102, it becomes Crystal Avenue, and finally at Tsienneto Road changes names again to Manchester Road before entering Londonderry in the western part of town.
*NH 28 Bypass, known locally as &quot;The Bypass&quot;, begins at South Main Street where NH 28 turns along with Rockingham Road, and continues on South Main Street, North Main Street, and Londonderry Turnpike before crossing the extreme northwestern corner of town and entering Auburn.
*NH 102 enters in the west from Londonderry, where it is known locally as Broadway. Running southwest to northeast, it crosses North and South Main Street (NH 28 Bypass) and East Derry Road at a traffic circle in the center of town (Danforth Circle), from where it follows Chester Road to the northern border with the town of Chester.
*NH 111 crosses the extreme southeastern corner of town, entering from Salem in the south, and passing into Atkinson in the east. There is only one intersection in the town, with Island Pond Road, with NH 111 spending less than 1/2 mile in Derry.
*NH 121 crosses the extreme northeastern corner of town for a few hundred feet between Hampstead and Sandown. There are no intersections on this stretch of NH 121 that connect to the rest of Derry, though Hampstead Road intersects NH 121 a few feet from the Derry border with Hampstead some distance to the south.
*Interstate 93 crosses the southwestern corner of Derry, for less than 1 mile. There are no interchanges in the town, but the interchange with NH 102 in Londonderry is less than 1,000 feet from the town line.

The nearest air transport is Manchester–Boston Regional Airport. There is currently no passenger rail service in Derry, though a former train depot in the center of town has been converted to a hub for the main commercial district in town. Amtrak provides Downeaster service and the MBTA&#x27; Haverhill Line at Haverhill station, 32 miles to the southeast.

<text>James Reid (9 July 1932 – 10 August 2010) was a Scottish trade union activist, orator, politician and journalist born in Govan, Glasgow. His role as spokesman and one of the leaders in the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in between June 1971 and October 1972 attracted international recognition. He later served as Rector of the University of Glasgow and subsequently became a journalist and broadcaster. Formerly a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Reid was later a member of the Labour Party. He moved on to supporting the Scottish Socialist Party in the late 1990s, then joined the Scottish National Party in 2005 and gave his full support to the idea of Scottish independence. He died in 2010 after a long illness.

== Early life==
Reid was born in Govan, Glasgow, then a major British shipbuilding centre. In his youth Reid joined the Young Communist League and later he became a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. He was involved in organising a major apprentices&#x27; strike at the Clyde shipyards in 1951.

==Union career==
Reid came to prominence in the early 1970s, when he led the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in to try to stop Edward Heath&#x27;s Conservative government from closing down the shipyards on the River Clyde. The government had decided that the shipyards should operate without state subsidy, which would have resulted in at least six thousand job losses. An engineer by trade and shop steward of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, Reid, along with his colleagues Jimmy Airlie, Sammy Gilmore and Sammy Barr, decided that the best way to show the viability of keeping the yards open was by staging a work-in rather than by going on strike. This meant that the workers would continue to complete what orders the shipyard had until the government changed policy.

In a speech to the workers Reid announced the beginning of workers&#x27; control of the shipyard and insisted on self-discipline while it was in force:

The occupation received support from across the world. There was a series of fundraising events, and foreign unions, celebrities such as John Lennon and Billy Connolly, and members of the public provided donations. The campaign was successful in persuading Heath to back down the following year, and the Clyde shipyards received £101million in public support over the following three years.

==Political career==

===CPGB years===
Reid was elected as a Communist councillor in Clydebank, where, until the local government reform of the mid-1970s, there were a few Communist councillors. He stood for the Communist Party of Great Britain in East Dunbartonshire in the 1970 general election.

Reid also served as Rector of the University of Glasgow, having been elected to the post in 1971, largely on the back of his union activities. When he was installed as Rector he gave a speech that has become known as &quot;the rat-race speech&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; printed the speech in full and described it as &quot;the greatest speech since President Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address&quot;. 

In the general election in February 1974 Reid stood for the Communist Party in Central Dunbartonshire, which was dominated by the town of Clydebank, against the sitting Labour member Hugh McCartney. Reid got 14.6 per cent of the votes cast, the best result for a Communist Party candidate in Britain for some time. It was a controversial campaign, as the ballot paper described Reid only as &quot;Engineering Worker,&quot; which some thought was disguising his Communist identity. One Catholic priest gave a sermon advising his parishioners to vote only for candidates whose beliefs were consistent with Christian principles. In his speech at the count Reid described his opponents as &quot;Falangists&quot; in reference to their perceived Catholic nationalism. He stood again in October 1974, when his vote share went down to 8.7 per cent.

===Leaving the CPGB for Labour and journalism===
Reid left the Communist Party in around 1975. The breakaway Scottish Labour Party considered recruiting him, but its leader, Jim Sillars, reportedly said: &quot;If we have that man in the party he&#x27;ll be competing with me for time on the box.&quot;

About a year after he left the CP Reid joined the Labour Party. He was Labour candidate in Dundee East in 1979, but lost to Gordon Wilson, then the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP). Writing in the aftermath of the election, Anthony Finlay stated in &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; that it was &quot;only because the Labour Party was foolish enough to pick Jimmy Reid&quot;, that Wilson held the seat when all but one of the 10 other SNP MPs was defeated. The decision by Dundee East Constituency Labour Party to select him as its candidate was controversial, as he had been a party member for less than the two years normally expected.

Reid then became a journalist and broadcaster, writing opinion columns for various newspapers including the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Herald&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Scotsman&quot;.He also presented an investigative series &#x27;The Reid Report&#x27;, for BBC Scotland. In 1985 he wrote and presented a series of documentaries entitled &quot;Reid About the USSR&quot;, for which his previous status within the Communist Party gave him unprecedented access. The series resulted in two BAFTAs. In 2000 Reid helped to establish the &quot;Scottish Left Review&quot;, a bimonthly publication. He also wrote a column in &quot;Tribune&quot; under the title &quot;As I Please&quot;, previously used by George Orwell in the same magazine.

Reid was highly critical of the UK miners&#x27; strike (1984–1985) and its leader Arthur Scargill. In his newspaper column Reid argued that the working miners could not properly be referred to as strikebreakers, as no national ballot had been held and no local ballot had passed a resolution to strike: &quot;A scab is someone who participates in a vote in which the majority are for taking strike action and then refuses to honour the decision. If you are denied the right to vote, it is impossible to be a scab.&quot; Reid&#x27;s attitude led to his coming under strong criticism from many former supporters in the Labour movement, and Mick McGahey described him as &quot;Broken Reid&quot;.

===Leaving Labour for the SNP===
Reid continued to support Labour up until the general election in 1997, but he became disillusioned with New Labour and in 1998 he urged voters to support the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) in the first election to the new Scottish Parliament. In the SNP leadership contest in 2004 Reid urged party members to support Alex Salmond for leader and Nicola Sturgeon for deputy leader, and he joined the party in the following year.

In 2007 &quot;From Govan to Gettysburg&quot;, a play by Brian McGeachan about Reid&#x27;s life, starring John Cairney, toured Scotland as part of celebrations of Jimmy Reid&#x27;s 75th birthday.

==Later life and death==
Reid retired to Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. He died at Inverclyde Royal Hospital on 10 August 2010. He had been in poor health for a number of years and had suffered a brain haemorrhage earlier in the week.

After a private service in Rothesay his hearse was driven into Glasgow for a secular funeral service at the Govan Old Parish Church on 19 August. The cortege passed the BAE Systems Surface Ships yard in Govan, one of the shipyards saved after the collapse of UCS, where hundreds of workers had gathered outside in tribute. The funeral service was attended by notable figures including Ed Balls, Ed Miliband, Gordon Brown, Alex Salmond, Alex Ferguson and Billy Connolly.

Reid is survived by his wife Joan, their three daughters and their three granddaughters, one of whom, Joani Reid, is a Labour Party Councillor in the London Borough of Lewisham. , Joani Reid is also the Scottish Labour prospective parliamentary candidate for East Kilbride and Strathaven in the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

The Jimmy Reid Foundation, a left-wing think tank and advocacy group, was established in his memory by the Editorial Board of the &quot;Scottish Left Review&quot;.

<text>The Assembly demoparty is an annual demoscene and gaming event in Finland. It is the biggest and the longest standing demoscene party. The Summer event takes place every year at Messukeskus in Helsinki, between late July and early August, and lasts three to four days. The 2020 edition was held online.

&quot;Assembly Winter&quot; was announced in early 2007. The winter party is held in January or February and is a more gaming-oriented LAN party–type event, whereas the summer events continues the traditions of the original demoparty under the name &quot;Assembly Summer&quot;.

== History ==
The first Assembly was held from July 24 to July 26, 1992, in Kauniainen. It was organized by the Amiga demo groups Complex and Rebels, and the PC demo group Future Crew. The staff grew into a large non-profit group of individuals known as Assembly Organizing. Through the 1990s, Assembly grew so large that even exposition halls no longer sufficed, and only the largest of sports arenas met the partygoers&#x27; needs. In 1999, they rented the largest sports arena in the country, Helsinki Halli (formerly Hartwall Arena) in Helsinki, with over 5000 visitors and 3500 computers on the ice rink.

The 2004 edition of the party also set a record: in July 2004, QuakeCon announced it was holding the world&#x27;s first Doom 3 competitions at the event starting on August 12–14, roughly a week after the game&#x27;s release on August 3. Assembly, however, managed to hold the first Doom 3 competitions after acquiring copies of the game via FedEx with the help of some contacts in the United States and holding the competition during August 5–8. 

Since 2014, the event has moved to Messukeskus Expo Centre. In 2022, the party celebrated 30 years of continuous operation. The main organizers of the event are Pekka Aakko (&quot;Pehu&quot; of Accession) and Jussi Laakkonen (&quot;Abyss&quot; of Future Crew).

==Boozembly==

Since 1995, an event called Boozembly has been organized in a nearby forest. It is officially unrelated to Assembly but serves as a meeting point for Assembly attendees as well as for other computer hobbyists and their friends. In Boozembly it is possible to use intoxicants which is not allowed in Assembly. Later IT corporations started to sponsor free beer for Boozembly. Like Assembly, Boozembly itself has become an important part of Finnish demoscene culture.

== Competitions ==

The party includes multiple competitions, or compos including but not limited to:

* Demo
* Oldskool demo (older machines)
* 64k intro (discontinued after 2011; reintroduced from 2017–2020)
* 4k intro
* 1k intro
* Dance music
* Listening music
* Fast Music
* Fast graphics
* Short film
* Real Wild demo
* Photo
* Video game developing compo

For the first eight years of Assembly, the demo and intro competitions were split into separate IBM PC compatible and Amiga categories. Starting in 2000, the platforms have been combined, with PC (Windows or Linux), Amiga, Mac and even high-end consoles competing in the same demo and intro competitions. Similarly, Commodore 64 competitions were replaced with &quot;oldskool&quot; competitions that also allow entries for some other old platforms, such as various 8-bit systems and older Amigas.

Entries are submitted by demogroups and individual artists and are rated by judges. All demos which are deemed to be of a high-enough standard are then shown on a big screen. Entries which break the competition rules (e.g. use copyrighted material, or aren&#x27;t suitable for the category to which they are entered) are disqualified. People who are present at the arena vote for the entries, and the results are published on the Assembly website. The entries are usually made available by the artists at scene.org or on the artists own website.

Assembly&#x27;s demo competitions generally hold a very high level, especially for a party that is not specific to the demoscene. Notable winners include &quot;Lifeforce&quot; by ASD, &quot;Panic Room&quot; by Fairlight and &quot;Frameranger&quot; by Fairlight, CNCD and Orange.

Janne &quot;Tempest&quot; Suni—who is a Finnish demoscener, pixel artist, tracker musician, and a member of the demogroup Fairlight—is best known for his song &quot;Acidjazzed Evening&quot;. &quot;Acidjazzed Evening&quot; originally won the oldskool music competition at the 2000 Assembly demoparty. Suni and his award-winning song came to mainstream prominence after the melody was unlawfully co-opted by hip-hop producer Timbaland in the 2006 song &quot;Do It&quot; by Nelly Furtado.
During Assembly demoparty 2013 an electronic music concert was performed on stage by Sabastian Teir alias „Kebu”.

=== Demo and intro competition winners ===
==AssemblyTV==
In recent years, Assembly has broadcast content from its in-house media effort AssemblyTV to local and national TV networks, as well as producing web streams for people to watch live over the internet — spots for hundreds, if not thousands of viewers are catered for, and these streams have been watched all over the world, not just in Finland. In addition to the opening and closing ceremonies, the competitions and party reports, the educational sessions that are being held during the party are broadcast via AssemblyTV.

==ARTtech seminars==
ARTtech seminars are free-to-attend educational seminar sessions that are being held during the party at the venue location. The sessions cover various subjects that are usually related to the main party theme and idea, including sessions about programming (coding), graphic design, music composition, game development, hardware hacks, scene history and more.

<text>Caspases (cysteine-aspartic proteases, cysteine aspartases or cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases) are a family of protease enzymes playing essential roles in programmed cell death. They are named caspases due to their specific cysteine protease activity – a cysteine in its active site nucleophilically attacks and cleaves a target protein only after an aspartic acid residue. As of 2009, there are 12 confirmed caspases in humans and 10 in mice, carrying out a variety of cellular functions.

The role of these enzymes in programmed cell death was first identified in 1993, with their functions in apoptosis well characterised. This is a form of programmed cell death, occurring widely during development, and throughout life to maintain cell homeostasis. Activation of caspases ensures that the cellular components are degraded in a controlled manner, carrying out cell death with minimal effect on surrounding tissues.

Caspases have other identified roles in programmed cell death such as pyroptosis, necroptosis and PANoptosis. These forms of cell death are important for protecting an organism from stress signals and pathogenic attack. Caspases also have a role in inflammation, whereby it directly processes pro-inflammatory cytokines such as pro-IL1β. These are signalling molecules that allow recruitment of immune cells to an infected cell or tissue. There are other identified roles of caspases such as cell proliferation, tumor suppression, cell differentiation, neural development and axon guidance and ageing.

&quot;Caspase deficiency&quot; has been identified as a cause of tumor development. Tumor growth can occur by a combination of factors, including a mutation in a cell cycle gene which removes the restraints on cell growth, combined with mutations in apoptotic proteins such as caspases that would respond by inducing cell death in abnormally growing cells. Conversely, over-activation of some caspases such as caspase-3 can lead to excessive programmed cell death. This is seen in several neurodegenerative diseases where neural cells are lost, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Caspases involved with processing inflammatory signals are also implicated in disease. Insufficient activation of these caspases can increase an organism&#x27;s susceptibility to infection, as an appropriate immune response may not be activated. The integral role caspases play in cell death and disease has led to research on using caspases as a drug target. For example, inflammatory caspase-1 has been implicated in causing autoimmune diseases; drugs blocking the activation of Caspase-1 have been used to improve the health of patients. Additionally, scientists have used caspases as cancer therapy to kill unwanted cells in tumors.

== Functional classification of caspases ==
Most caspases play a role in programmed cell death. These are summarized in the table below. The enzymes are sub classified into three types: Initiator, Executioner and Inflammatory.

Note that in addition to apoptosis, caspase-8 is also required for the inhibition of another form of programmed cell death called necroptosis. Caspase-14 plays a role in epithelial cell keratinocyte differentiation and can form an epidermal barrier that protects against dehydration and UVB radiation.

== Activation of caspases ==
Caspases are synthesised as inactive zymogens (pro-caspases) that are only activated following an appropriate stimulus. This post-translational level of control allows rapid and tight regulation of the enzyme.

Activation involves dimerization and often oligomerisation of pro-caspases, followed by cleavage into a small subunit and large subunit. The large and small subunit associate with each other to form an active heterodimer caspase. The active enzyme often exists as a heterotetramer in the biological environment, where a pro-caspase dimer is cleaved together to form a heterotetramer.

=== Dimerisation ===
The activation of initiator caspases and inflammatory caspases is initiated by dimerisation, which is facilitated by binding to adaptor proteins via protein–protein interaction motifs that are collectively referred to as death folds. The death folds are located in a structural domain of the caspases known as the pro-domain, which is larger in those caspases that contain death folds than in those that do not. The pro-domain of the intrinsic initiator caspases and the inflammatory caspases contains a single death fold known as caspase recruitment domain (CARD), while the pro-domain of the extrinsic initiator caspases contains two death folds known as death effector domains (DED).

&quot;Multiprotein complexes&quot; often form during caspase activation. Some activating multiprotein complexes includes:
* The &quot;death-inducing signaling complex&quot; (DISC) during extrinsic apoptosis
* The &quot;apoptosome&quot; during intrinsic apoptosis
* The &quot;inflammasome&quot; during pyroptosis

=== Cleavage ===
Once appropriately dimerised, the Caspases cleave at inter domain linker regions, forming a large and small subunit. This cleavage allows the active-site loops to take up a conformation favourable for enzymatic activity.

&quot;Cleavage of Initiator and Executioner caspases&quot; occur by different methods outlined in the table below.
* Initiator caspases auto-proteolytically cleave whereas Executioner caspases are cleaved by initiator caspases. This hierarchy allows an amplifying chain reaction or cascade for degrading cellular components, during controlled cell death.

== Some roles of caspases ==

=== Apoptosis ===

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death where the cell undergoes morphological changes, to minimize its effect on surrounding cells to avoid inducing an immune response. The cell shrinks and condenses - the cytoskeleton will collapse, and the nuclear envelope disassembles the DNA fragments up. This results in the cell forming self-enclosed bodies called &#x27;blebs&#x27;, to avoid release of cellular components into the extracellular medium. Additionally, the cell membrane phospholipid content is altered, which makes the dying cell more susceptible to phagocytic attack and removal.

&quot;Apoptotic caspases are subcategorised as:&quot;
# &quot;Initiator Caspases&quot; (Caspase 2, Caspase 8, Caspase 9, Caspase 10)
# &quot;Executioner Caspases&quot; (Caspase 3, Caspase 6 and Caspase 7)
Once initiator caspases are activated, they produce a chain reaction, activating several other executioner caspases. Executioner caspases degrade over 600 cellular components in order to induce the morphological changes for apoptosis.

&quot;Examples of caspase cascade during apoptosis:&quot;
# &quot;Intrinsic apoptopic pathway:&quot; During times of cellular stress, mitochondrial &quot;cytochrome&quot; c is released into the cytosol. This molecule binds an adaptor protein (APAF-1), which recruits initiator Caspase-9 (via CARD-CARD interactions). This leads to the formation of a Caspase activating multiprotein complex called the &quot;Apoptosome.&quot; Once activated, initiator caspases such as Caspase 9 will cleave and activate other executioner caspases. This leads to degradation of cellular components for apoptosis.
# &quot;Extrinsic apoptopic pathway:&quot; The caspase cascade is also activated by extracellular ligands, via cell surface Death Receptors. This is done by the formation of a multiprotein Death Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC) that recruits and activates a pro-caspase. For example, the Fas Ligand binds the FasR receptor at the receptor&#x27;s extracellular surface; this activates the death domains at the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. The adaptor protein FADD will recruit (by a Death domain-Death domain interaction) pro-Caspase 8 via the DED domain. This FasR, FADD and pro-Caspase 8 form the Death Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC) where &quot;Caspase-8 is activated.&quot; This could lead to either downstream activation of the intrinsic pathway by inducing mitochondrial stress, or direct activation of Executioner Caspases (Caspase 3, Caspase 6 and Caspase 7) to degrade cellular components as shown in the adjacent diagram.

=== Pyroptosis ===
Pyroptosis is a form of programmed cell death that inherently induces an immune response. It is morphologically distinct from other types of cell death – cells swell up, rupture and release pro-inflammatory cellular contents. This is done in response to a range of stimuli including microbial infections as well as heart attacks (myocardial infarctions). Caspase-1, Caspase-4 and Caspase-5 in humans, and Caspase-1 and Caspase-11 in mice play important roles in inducing cell death by pyroptosis. This limits the life and proliferation time of intracellular and extracellular pathogens.

==== Pyroptosis by caspase-1 ====

Caspase-1 activation is mediated by a repertoire of proteins, allowing detection of a range of pathogenic ligands. Some mediators of Caspase-1 activation are: NOD-like Leucine Rich Repeats (NLRs), AIM2-Like Receptors (ALRs), Pyrin and IFI16.

These proteins allow caspase-1 activation by forming a multiprotein activating complex called Inflammasomes. For example, a NOD Like Leucine Rich Repeat NLRP3 will sense an efflux of potassium ions from the cell. This cellular ion imbalance leads to oligomerisation of NLRP3 molecules to form a multiprotein complex called the NLRP3 inflammasome. The pro-caspase-1 is brought into close proximity with other pro-caspase molecule in order to dimerise and undergo auto-proteolytic cleavage.

Some pathogenic signals that lead to Pyroptosis by Caspase-1 are listed below:
* &quot;DNA in the host cytosol&quot; binds to AIM2-Like Receptors inducing Pyroptosis
* &quot;Type III secretion system apparatus from bacteria&quot; bind NOD Like Leucine Rich Repeats receptors called NAIP&#x27;s (1 in humans and 4 in mice)
&quot;Pyroptosis by Caspase-4 and Caspase-5 in humans and Caspase-11 in mice&quot;

These caspases have the ability to induce direct pyroptosis when lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules (found in the cell wall of gram negative bacteria) are found in the cytoplasm of the host cell. For example, Caspase 4 acts as a receptor and is proteolytically activated, without the need of an inflammasome complex or Caspase-1 activation.

A crucial downstream substrate for pyroptotic caspases is Gasdermin D (GSDMD)

=== Role in inflammation ===
Inflammation is a protective attempt by an organism to restore a homeostatic state, following disruption from harmful stimulus, such as tissue damage or bacterial infection.

Caspase-1, Caspase-4, Caspase-5 and Caspase-11 are considered &#x27;Inflammatory Caspases&#x27;.
* &quot;Caspase-1&quot; is key in activating pro-inflammatory cytokines; these act as signals to immune cells and make the environment favourable for immune cell recruitment to the site of damage. Caspase-1 therefore plays a fundamental role in the innate immune system. The enzyme is responsible for processing cytokines such as pro-ILβ and pro-IL18, as well as secreting them.
* &quot;Caspase-4 and -5 in humans, and Caspase-11&quot; &quot;in mice&quot; have a unique role as a receptor, whereby it binds to LPS, a molecule abundant in gram negative bacteria. This can lead to the processing and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 cytokines by activating Caspase-1; this downstream effect is the same as described above. It also leads to the secretion of another inflammatory cytokine that is not processed. This is called pro-IL1α. There is also evidence of an inflammatory caspase, caspase-11 aiding cytokine secretion; this is done by inactivating a membrane channel that blocks IL-1β secretion
* Caspases can also induce an inflammatory response on a transcriptional level. There is evidence where it promotes transcription of &quot;nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB&quot;), a transcription factor that assists in transcribing inflammatory cytokines such as IFNs, TNF, IL-6 and IL-8. For example, Caspase-1 activates Caspase-7, which in turn cleaves the poly (ADP) ribose – this activates transcription of NF-κB controlled genes.

== Discovery of caspases ==
H. Robert Horvitz initially established the importance of caspases in apoptosis and found that the &quot;ced-3&quot; gene is required for the cell death that took place during the development of the nematode &quot;C. elegans&quot;. Horvitz and his colleague Junying Yuan found in 1993 that the protein encoded by the ced-3 gene is cysteine protease with similar properties to the mammalian interleukin-1-beta converting enzyme (ICE) (now known as caspase 1). At the time, ICE was the only known caspase. Other mammalian caspases were subsequently identified, in addition to caspases in organisms such as fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.

Researchers decided upon the nomenclature of the caspase in 1996. In many instances, a particular caspase had been identified simultaneously by more than one laboratory; each would then give the protein a different name. For example, caspase 3 was variously known as CPP32, apopain and Yama. Caspases, therefore, were numbered in the order in which they were identified. ICE was, therefore, renamed as caspase 1. ICE was the first mammalian caspase to be characterised because of its similarity to the nematode death gene ced-3, but it appears that the principal role of this enzyme is to mediate inflammation rather than cell death.

== Evolution ==
In animals apoptosis is induced by caspases and in fungi and plants, apoptosis is induced by arginine and lysine-specific caspase like proteases called metacaspases. Homology searches revealed a close homology between caspases and the caspase-like proteins of &quot;Reticulomyxa&quot; (a unicellular organism). The phylogenetic study indicates that divergence of caspase and metacaspase sequences occurred before the divergence of eukaryotes.

<doc id="291112" wikidata="Q312966" url="?curid=291112" title="Abdul Ghaffar Khan">
<text>Abdul Ghaffar Khan (; 6 February 1890 – 20 January 1988), also known as Bacha Khan () or Badshah Khan (), was an Indian independence activist from the North-West Frontier Province, and founder of the Khudai Khidmatgar resistance movement against British colonial rule in India.

He was a political and spiritual leader known for his nonviolent opposition and lifelong pacifism; he was a devout Muslim and an advocate for Hindu–Muslim unity in the subcontinent. Due to his similar ideologies and close friendship with Mahatma Gandhi, Khan was nicknamed Sarhadi Gandhi (). In 1929, Khan founded the Khudai Khidmatgar, an anti-colonial nonviolent resistance movement. The Khudai Khidmatgar&#x27;s success and popularity eventually prompted the colonial government to launch numerous crackdowns against Khan and his supporters; the Khudai Khidmatgar experienced some of the most severe repression of the entire Indian independence movement.

Khan strongly opposed the proposal for the Partition of India into the Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan and the Hindu-majority Dominion of India, and consequently sided with the pro-union Indian National Congress and All-India Azad Muslim Conference against the pro-partition All-India Muslim League. When the Indian National Congress reluctantly declared its acceptance of the partition plan without consulting the Khudai Khidmatgar leaders, he felt deeply betrayed, telling the Congress leaders &quot;you have thrown us to the wolves.&quot; In June 1947, Khan and other Khudai Khidmatgar leaders formally issued the Bannu Resolution to the British authorities, demanding that the ethnic Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan, which was to comprise all of the Pashtun territories of British India and not be included (as almost all other Muslim-majority provinces were) within the state of Pakistan—the creation of which was still underway at the time. However, the British government refused the demands of this resolution. In response, Khan and his elder brother, Abdul Jabbar Khan, boycotted the 1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum on whether the province should be merged with India or Pakistan, objecting that it did not offer options for the Pashtun-majority province to become independent or to join neighbouring Afghanistan.

After the Partition of India by the British government, Khan pledged allegiance to the newly created nation of Pakistan, and stayed in the now-Pakistani North-West Frontier Province; he was frequently arrested by the Pakistani government between 1948 and 1954. In 1956, he was arrested for his opposition to the One Unit program, under which the government announced its plan to merge all the provinces of West Pakistan into a single unit to match the political structure of erstwhile East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh). Khan was jailed or in exile during some years of the 1960s and 1970s. He was awarded Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian award, by the Indian government in 1987.

Following his will upon his death in Peshawar in 1988, he was buried at his house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral including Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah, marching through the Khyber Pass from Peshawar towards Jalalabad. It was marred by two bomb explosions that killed 15 people; despite the heavy fighting at the time due to the Soviet–Afghan War, both sides, namely the Soviet–Afghan government coalition and the Afghan mujahideen, declared an immediate ceasefire to allow Khan&#x27;s burial. He was given military honors by the Afghan government.

== Early years ==
Abdul Ghaffar Khan was born on 6 February 1890 into a prosperous Sunni Muslim Muhammadzai Pashtun family from Utmanzai, Hashtnagar; they lived by the Jindee-a, a branch of the Swat River, in what was then British India&#x27;s Punjab province. His father, Abdul Bahram Khan, was a land owner in Hashtnagar. Khan was the second son of Bahram to attend the British-run Edward&#x27;s Mission School, which was the only fully-functioning school in the region and which was administered by Christian missionaries. At school, Khan did well in his studies, and was inspired by his mentor, Reverend Wigram, into seeing the crucial role education played in service to the local community. In his tenth and final year of secondary school, he was offered a highly prestigious commission in the Corps of Guides regiment of the British Indian Army. Khan declined due to his observational feelings that even Guides&#x27; Indian officers were still second-class citizens in their own nation. He subsequently followed through with his initial desire to attend university, and Reverend Wigram (Khan&#x27;s teacher) offered him the opportunity to follow his brother, Abdul Jabbar Khan, to study in London, England. After graduating from Aligarh Muslim University, Khan eventually received permission from his father to travel to London. However, his mother wasn&#x27;t willing to let another son go to London, so he began working on his father&#x27;s lands in the process of figuring out his next steps.

At the age of 20 in 1910, Khan opened a madrasa in his hometown of Utmanzai. In 1911, he joined the independence movement of the Pashtun activist Haji Sahib of Turangzai. By 1915, the British colonial authorities had shut down Khan&#x27;s madrasa, deeming its pro-Indian independence activism to be a threat to their authority. Having witnessed the repeated failure of Indian revolts against British rule, Khan decided that social activism and reform would be more beneficial for the ethnic Pashtuns. This led to the formation of the &quot;Anjuman-e Islāh-e Afghānia&quot; (Pashto: ) in 1921, and the youth movement &quot;Pax̌tūn Jirga&quot; () in 1927. After Khan&#x27;s return from the Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Hejaz−Nejd (present-day Saudi Arabia) in May 1928, he founded the Pashto-language monthly political journal &quot;Pax̌tūn&quot; (). Finally, in November 1929, Khan founded the &quot;Khudāyī Khidmatgār&quot; () movement, which would strongly advocate for the end of British colonial rule and establishment of a unified and independent India.

== Ghaffar &quot;Badshah&quot; Khan ==

In response to his inability to continue his own education, Bacha Khan turned to helping others start theirs. Like many such regions of the world, the strategic importance of the newly formed North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan), as a buffer for the British Raj from Russian influence was of little benefit to its residents. Opposition to British colonial rule, the authority of the mullahs, and an ancient culture of violence and vendetta prompted Bacha Khan to want to serve and uplift his fellow men and women by means of education. At 20 years of age, Bacha Khan opened his first school in Utmanzai. It was an instant success and he was soon invited into a larger circle of progressively minded reformers.

While he faced much opposition and personal difficulties, Bacha Khan worked tirelessly to organise and raise the consciousness of his fellow Pashtuns. Between 1915 and 1918 he visited 500 villages in all part of the settled districts of NWFP. It was in this frenzied activity that he had come to be known as &quot;Badshah (Bacha) Khan&quot; (&quot;King of Chiefs&quot;).

Being a secular Muslim he did not believe in religious divisions. He married his first wife Meharqanda in 1912; she was a daughter of Yar Mohammad Khan of the Kinankhel clan of the Mohammadzai tribe of Razzar, a village adjacent to Utmanzai. They had a son in 1913, Abdul Ghani Khan, who would become a noted artist and poet. Subsequently, they had another son, Abdul Wali Khan (17 January 1917 – 2006), and daughter, Sardaro. Meharqanda died during the 1918 influenza epidemic. In 1920, Bacha Khan remarried; his new wife, Nambata, was a cousin of his first wife and the daughter of Sultan Mohammad Khan of Razzar. They had a daughter, Mehar Taj (25 May 1921 – 29 April 2012), and a son, Abdul Ali Khan (20 August 1922 – 19 February 1997). Tragically, in 1926 Nambata died early as well from a fall down the stairs of the apartment where they were staying in Jerusalem.

== Khudai Khidmatgar ==
In time, Bacha Khan&#x27;s goal came to be the formulation of a united, independent, secular India. To achieve this end, he founded the &quot;Khudai Khidmatgar&quot; (&quot;Servants of God&quot;), commonly known as the &quot;Red Shirts&quot; (&quot;Surkh Pōsh&quot;), during the 1920s.

The &quot;Khudai Khidmatgar&quot; was founded on a belief in the power of Gandhi&#x27;s notion of Satyagraha, a form of active non-violence as captured in an oath. He told its members:
I am going to give you such a weapon that the police and the army will not be able to stand against it. It is the weapon of the Prophet, but you are not aware of it. That weapon is patience and righteousness. No power on earth can stand against it.

The organisation recruited over 100,000 members and became influential in the independence movement for their resistance to the colonial government. Through strikes, political organisation and non-violent opposition, the &quot;Khudai Khidmatgar&quot; were able to achieve some success and came to dominate the politics of NWFP. His brother, Dr. Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan (known as Dr. Khan Sahib), led the political wing of the movement, and was the Chief Minister of the province (from 1937 and then until 1947 when his government was dismissed by Mohammad Ali Jinnah of the Muslim League).

=== Kissa Khwani Massacre ===

On 23 April 1930, Bacha Khan was arrested during protests arising out of the Salt Satyagraha. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar gathered in Peshawar&#x27;s Kissa Khwani (Storytellers) Bazaar. The colonial government ordered troops to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200–250. The Khudai Khidmatgar members acted in accord with their training in non-violence under Bacha Khan, facing bullets as the troops fired on them. Two platoons of the Garhwal Rifles regiment under Chandra Singh Garhwali refused to fire on the non-violent crowd. They were later court-martialled and sentenced to a variety of punishments, including life imprisonment.

== Bacha Khan and the Indian National Congress ==
Bacha Khan forged a close, spiritual, and uninhibited friendship with Gandhi, the pioneer of non-violent mass civil disobedience in India. The two had a deep admiration towards each other and worked together closely till 1947.

&quot;Khudai Khidmatgar&quot; (servants of God) agitated and worked cohesively with the Indian National Congress (INC), the leading national organisation fighting for independence, of which Bacha Khan was a senior and respected member. On several occasions when the Congress seemed to disagree with Gandhi on policy, Bacha Khan remained his staunchest ally. In 1931 the Congress offered him the presidency of the party, but he refused saying, &quot;I am a simple soldier and Khudai Khidmatgar, and I only want to serve.&quot; He remained a member of the Congress Working Committee for many years, resigning only in 1939 because of his differences with the Party&#x27;s War Policy. He rejoined the Congress Party when the War Policy was revised.

Bacha Khan was a champion of women&#x27;s rights and non-violence. He became a hero in a society dominated by violence; notwithstanding his liberal views, his unswerving faith and obvious bravery led to immense respect. Throughout his life, he never lost faith in his non-violent methods or in the compatibility of Islam and non-violence. He recognised as a jihad struggle with only the enemy holding swords. He was closely identified with Gandhi because of his non-violence principles and he is known in India as the &#x27;Frontier Gandhi&#x27;. One of his Congress associates was Pandit Amir Chand Boambwal of Peshawar.

== The Partition ==

Khan strongly opposed the partition of India. Accused as being anti-Muslim by some politicians, Khan was physically assaulted in 1946, leading to his hospitalisation in Peshawar. On 21 June 1947, in Bannu, a &quot;loya jirga&quot; was held consisting of Bacha Khan, the Khudai Khidmatgars, members of the Provincial Assembly, Mirzali Khan (Faqir of Ipi), and other tribal chiefs, just seven weeks before the partition. The &quot;loya jirga&quot; issueud the Bannu Resolution, which demanded that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan composing all Pashtun territories of British India, instead of being made to join either India or Pakistan. However, the British refused to comply with the demand of this resolution.

The Congress Party refused last-ditch compromises to prevent the partition, like the Cabinet Mission Plan and Gandhi&#x27;s suggestion to offer the position of Prime Minister to Jinnah.

When the July 1947 NWFP Referendum over accession to Pakistan was held, Bacha Khan, the Khudai Khidmatgars, the then Chief Minister Khan Sahib, and the Indian National Congress Party boycotted the referendum. Some have argued that a segment of the population was barred from voting.

== Arrest and exile ==

Bacha Khan took the oath of allegiance to the new nation of Pakistan on 23 February 1948 at the first session of the Pakistan Constituent Assembly.

He pledged full support to the government and attempted to reconcile with the founder of the new state Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Although initial overtures led to a successful meeting in Karachi, a follow-up meeting in the Khudai Khidmatgar HQ never materialised, allegedly due to the role of NWFP Chief Minister, Abdul Qayyum Khan Kashmiri, who told Jinnah that Bacha Khan was plotting his assassination.

Following this, Bacha Khan formed Pakistan&#x27;s first national opposition party, on 8 May 1948, the Pakistan Azad Party. The party pledged to play the role of constructive opposition and would be non-communal in its philosophy.

However, suspicions of his allegiance persisted and under the new Pakistani government, Bacha Khan was placed under house arrest without charge from 1948 till 1954. In 1954, Bacha Khan split with his elder brother Khan Sahib after the latter joined the Central Cabinet of Muhammad Ali Bogra as Minister for Communications. Released from prison, he gave a speech again on the floor of the National Assembly, this time condemning the massacre of his supporters at Babrra.


He was arrested several times after late 1948. In 1956 he was arrested for opposing the One Unit Scheme. The government attempted in 1958 to reconcile with him and offered him a ministry in the government, after the assassination of his brother, but he refused. He remained in prison till 1957 only to be re-arrested in 1958 until an illness in 1964 allowed for his release.

In 1962, Bacha Khan was named an &quot;Amnesty International Prisoner of the Year&quot;. Amnesty&#x27;s statement about him said, &quot;His example symbolizes the suffering of upward of a million people all over the world who are prisoners of conscience.&quot;

In September 1964, the Pakistani authorities allowed him to go to the United Kingdom for treatment. During the winter, his doctor advised him to go to United States. He then went into exile to Afghanistan, he returned from exile in December 1972 to popular support, following the establishment of National Awami Party provincial governments in North West Frontier Province and Balochistan.

He was arrested by Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s government at Multan in November 1973 and described Bhutto&#x27;s government as &quot;the worst kind of dictatorship&quot;.

In 1984, increasingly withdrawing from politics, he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. He visited India and participated in the centennial celebrations of the Indian National Congress in 1985; he was awarded the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1967 and later Bharat Ratna, India&#x27;s highest civilian award, in 1987.

His final major political challenge was against the Kalabagh dam project, fearing that the project would damage the Peshawar valley. His hostility would eventually lead to the project being shelved after his death.

==Death==
Bacha Khan died in Peshawar in 1988 from complications of a stroke and was buried in his house at Jalalabad, Afghanistan. Over 200,000 mourners attended his funeral, including the Afghan president Mohammad Najibullah. The then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi went to Peshawar, to pay his tributes to Bacha Khan despite the fact that General Zia ul-Haq attempted to stall his attendance citing security reasons. Additionally, the Indian government declared a five-day period of mourning in his honour.
Although he had been repeatedly imprisoned and persecuted, tens of thousands of mourners attended his funeral, described by one commentator as &quot;a caravan of peace, carrying a message of love&quot; from Pashtuns east of the Khyber to those on the west, marching through the historic Khyber Pass from Peshawar to Jalalabad. This symbolic march was planned by Bacha Khan, to affirmatively demonstrate his dream of Pashtun unification and to help that dream live on after his death. A cease-fire was announced in the Afghan Civil War to allow the funeral to take place, even though it was marred by bomb explosions killing fifteen people.

==Memorial==
The Banaras Flyover in Karachi and the Bacha Khan Chowk it traverses stand as memorials to Abdul Ghaffar Khan. The chowk, named in his honor, was a cultural and political landmark for the local Pashtun community, is now overshadowed by the flyover.

==Pashtunistan==
Abdul Ghaffar Khan took an oath of allegiance to Pakistan in 1948 in the legislation assembly. When during his speech he was asked by the PM Liaquat Ali Khan about Pashtunistan, he replied that it was just a name for the Pashtun province in Pakistan, just as Punjab, Bengal, Sindh, and Baluchistan are the names of provinces of Pakistan as ethno-linguistic names, However, this compromise was apparently contrary to what he believed in and strived for before partition: Pashtunistan as an independent state after the failure of the idea of a united India.

Later on in 1980, during an interview with an Indian journalist, Haroon Siddiqui, in Jalalabad, Abdul Ghaffar Khan said 
 He also said in the same interview that &quot;I&#x27;ll live here. I&#x27;m now (for all intents and purposes) an Afghan. I&#x27;m not even permitting my son, Khan Abdul Wali Khan, political leader of Pakistan&#x27;s North West Frontier Province, to visit me because he&#x27;ll insist that I go with him to Pakistan. But I don&#x27;t want to go.&quot;

== Family ==
Bacha Khan married his first wife Meharqanda in 1912; she was a daughter of Yar Mohammad Khan of the Kinankhel clan of the Mohammadzai tribe of Razzar, a village adjacent to Utmanzai. They had a son in 1913, Abdul Ghani Khan, who would become a noted artist and poet. Subsequently, they had another son, Abdul Wali Khan (17 January 1917 – 2006), and daughter, Sardaro. Meharqanda died during the 1918 influenza epidemic. In 1920, Bacha Khan remarried; his new wife, Nambata, was a cousin of his first wife and the daughter of Sultan Mohammad Khan of Razzar. They had a daughter, Mehar Taj (25 May 1921 – 29 April 2012), and a son, Abdul Ali Khan (20 August 1922 – 19 February 1997). Tragically, in 1926 Nambata died early as well from a fall down the stairs of the apartment where they were staying in Jerusalem.

== Legacy ==
Bacha Khan&#x27;s political legacy is renowned amongst Pashtuns and those in modern Republic of India as a leader of a non-violent movement. Within Pakistan, however, the vast majority of society have questioned his stance with the All India Congress over the Muslim League as well as his opposition to the partition of India and Jinnah. In particular, people have questioned where Bacha Khan&#x27;s patriotism rests.
His eldest son Ghani Khan was a poet. Ghani Khan&#x27;s wife, Roshan, was from a Parsi family and was the daughter of Nawab Rustam Jang, a prince of Hyderabad. His second son, Abdul Wali Khan, was the founder and leader of the Awami National Party from 1986 to 2006, and was the Leader of the Opposition in the Pakistan National Assembly from 1988 to 1990.

His third son Abdul Ali Khan was non-political and a distinguished educator, and served as Vice-Chancellor of University of Peshawar. Ali Khan was also the head of Aitchison College in Lahore and Fazle Haq College in Mardan.

His niece Mariam married Jaswant Singh in 1939. Jaswant Singh was a young British Indian airforce officer and was Sikh by faith. Mariam later converted to Christianity.

Mohammed Yahya, Education Minister of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, was the only son-in-law of Bacha Khan.

Asfandyar Wali Khan is the grandson of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and was the leader of the Awami National Party. The party was in power from 2008 to 2013.

Zarine Khan Walsh, who lives in Mumbai, is the granddaughter of Abdul Ghaffar Khan and was the second daughter of Abdul Ghaffar Khan&#x27;s eldest son Abdul Ghani Khan.

The All India Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind is chaired by Yasmin Nigar Khan, who claims to be the great-granddaughter of Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Awami National Party leader Asfandyar Wali Khan rejected the claim, though a cultural ministry official clarified that Yasmin Nigar Khan was a descendant of Abdul Ghaffar Khan&#x27;s &quot;adopted&quot; son.

Salma Ataullahjan is the great-grandniece of Abdul Ghaffar Khan and a member of the Senate of Canada.

In 2008, a documentary, titled &quot;The Frontier Gandhi: Badshah Khan, a Torch for Peace&quot;, by film-maker and writer T.C. McLuhan, premiered in New York. The film received the 2009 award for Best Documentary Film at the Middle East International Film Festival (see film page).

In 1990, Abdul Kabeer Siddiqui of Indian National TV made a 30-minute English-language biographical documentary film on Badshah Khan, titled &quot;The Majestic Man&quot;. It was telecast on Doordarshan.

In Richard Attenborough&#x27;s 1982 epic &quot;Gandhi&quot;, Bacha Khan was portrayed by Dilsher Singh.

In his home city of Peshawar, the Bacha Khan International Airport is named after him.

In his hometown Charsadda, the Bacha Khan University is named after him.

Bacha Khan was listed as one of 26 men who changed the world in a recent children&#x27;s book published in the United States, alongside Tiger Woods and Yo-Yo Ma. He also wrote an autobiography (1969), and has been the subject of biographies by Eknath Easwaran (see article) and Rajmohan Gandhi (see &quot;References&quot; section, below). His philosophy of Islamic pacifism was recognised by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in a speech to American Muslims.

In the Indian city of Delhi, the popular Khan Market is named in his honour, along with Ghaffar market in the Karol Bagh area of New Delhi. In Mumbai, a seafront road and promenade in the Worli neighbourhood was named Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan Marg after him.

<doc id="291114" wikidata="Q650401" url="?curid=291114" title="Parathyroid gland">
<text>Parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands in the neck of humans and other tetrapods. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, located on the back of the thyroid gland in variable locations. The parathyroid gland produces and secretes parathyroid hormone in response to low blood calcium, which plays a key role in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.

Parathyroid glands share a similar blood supply, venous drainage, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands. Parathyroid glands are derived from the epithelial lining of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, with the superior glands arising from the fourth pouch and the inferior glands arising from the higher third pouch. The relative position of the inferior and superior glands, which are named according to their final location, changes because of the migration of embryological tissues.

Hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism, characterized by alterations in the blood calcium levels and bone metabolism, are states of either surplus or deficient parathyroid function.

==Structure==
The parathyroid glands are two pairs of glands usually positioned behind the left and right lobes of the thyroid. Each gland is a yellowish-brown flat ovoid that resembles a lentil seed, usually about 6 mm long and 3 to 4 mm wide, and 1 to 2 mm anteroposteriorly. There are typically four parathyroid glands. The two parathyroid glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands. Healthy parathyroid glands generally weigh about 30 mg in men and 35 mg in women. These glands are not visible or able to be felt during examination of the neck.

Each parathyroid vein drains into the superior, middle and inferior thyroid veins. The superior and middle thyroid veins drain into the internal jugular vein, and the inferior thyroid vein drains into the brachiocephalic vein.

===Lymphatic drainage===
Lymphatic vessels from the parathyroid glands drain into deep cervical lymph nodes and paratracheal lymph nodes.

===Variation===
The parathyroid glands are variable in number: three or more small glands, and can usually be located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. Rarely, the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the thymus.

===Microanatomy===
The parathyroid glands are named for their proximity to the thyroid—and serve a completely different role than the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands are quite easily recognizable from the thyroid as they have densely packed cells, in contrast with the follicular structure of the thyroid. Two unique types of cells are present in the parathyroid gland:
* Chief cells, which synthesize and release parathyroid hormone. These cells are small, and appear dark when loaded with parathyroid hormone, and clear when the hormone has been secreted, or in their resting state.
* Oxyphil cells, which are lighter in appearance and increase in number with age, have an unknown function.

===Development===
In the early development of the human embryo, a series of five pharyngeal arches and four pharyngeal pouches form that give rise to the face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest to the top of the embryo&#x27;s head and the fourth is the farthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological development. The pair of glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas the pair of glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downward, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downward by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus&#x27;s ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.

Parathyroid development is regulated by a number of genes, including those coding for several transcription factors.

==Function==

The major function of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body&#x27;s calcium and phosphate levels within a very narrow range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. The parathyroid glands do this by secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH).

Parathyroid hormone (also known as parathormone) is a small protein that takes part in the control of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, as well as bone physiology. Parathyroid hormone has effects antagonistic to those of calcitonin.

* Calcium. PTH increases blood calcium levels by directly stimulating osteoblasts and thereby indirectly stimulating osteoclasts (through RANK/RANKL mechanism) to break down bone and release calcium. PTH increases gastrointestinal calcium absorption by activating vitamin D, and promotes calcium conservation (reabsorption) by the kidneys.
* Phosphate. PTH is the major regulator of serum phosphate concentrations via actions on the kidney. It is an inhibitor of proximal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Through activation of vitamin D the absorption (intestinal) of phosphate is increased.

==Disorders==

Parathyroid disease is conventionally divided into states where the parathyroid is overactive (hyperparathyroidism), and states where the parathyroid is under- or hypoactive (hypoparathyroidism). Both states are characterised by their symptoms, which relate to the excess or deficiency of parathyroid hormone in the blood.

===Hyperparathyroidism===

====Primary====

Hyperparathyroidism is the state in which there is excess parathyroid hormone circulating in the blood. This may cause bone pain and tenderness, due to increased bone resorption. With increased circulating calcium, there may be other symptoms associated with hypercalcemia, most commonly dehydration. Hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a benign proliferation of chief cells in one parathyroid gland, and rarely in MEN syndrome. This is known as primary hyperparathyroidism, which is generally managed by surgical removal of the abnormal parathyroid gland.

====Secondary====
Renal disease may lead to hyperparathyroidism. When too much calcium is lost from the blood via urination, there is a compensation by the parathyroid, and parathyroid hormone is released. The glands enlarge (hypertrophy) to synthesize more parathyroid hormone. This is known as secondary hyperparathyroidism. 

====Tertiary====
If secondary hyperparathyroidism persists over months, the parathyroid tissue may become unresponsive to the blood calcium levels, and begin to autonomously release parathyroid hormone. This is known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

===Hypoparathyroidism===

The state of decreased parathyroid activity is known as hypoparathyroidism. This is most commonly associated with damage to the glands or their blood supply during thyroid surgeryit may be associated with rarer genetic syndromes such as DiGeorge syndrome, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant syndrome. Hypoparathyroidism will occur after surgical removal of the parathyroid glands.

Occasionally, an individual&#x27;s tissues are resistant to the effects of parathyroid hormone. This is known as pseudohypoparathyroidism. In this case the parathyroid glands are fully functional, and the hormone itself is not able to function, resulting in a decrease in blood calcium levels. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is often associated with the genetic condition Albright&#x27;s hereditary osteodystrophy. Pseudo-pseudohypoparathyroidism, one of the longest words in the English language, is used to describe an individual with Albright&#x27;s hereditary osteodystrophy with normal parathyroid hormone and serum calcium levels.

Hypoparathyroidism may present with symptoms associated with decreased calcium, and is generally treated with Vitamin D analogues.

==History==
The parathyroid glands were first discovered in the Indian rhinoceros by Richard Owen in 1852. In his description of the neck anatomy, Owen referred to the glands as &quot;a small compact yellow glandular body attached to the thyroid at the point where the veins emerged&quot;. The glands were first discovered in humans by Ivar Viktor Sandström (1852–1889), a Swedish medical student, in 1880 at Uppsala University. Unaware of Owen&#x27;s description, he described the glands in his monograph &quot;On a New Gland in Man and Fellow Animals&quot; as the &quot;glandulae parathyroidae&quot;, noting its existence in dogs, cats, rabbits, oxen, horses and humans. For several years, Sandström&#x27;s description received little attention.

Eugene Gley, Giulio Vassale, and others documented the putative function of the glands in 1891, noting the connection between their removal and the development of muscular tetany. William G. MacCallum in 1908, investigating tumours of the parathyroid, proposed their role in calcium metabolism. He noted that &quot;Tetany occurs spontaneously in many forms and may be produced by the destruction of the parathyroid glands&quot;.

The first successful removal of the parathyroid may have been carried out in 1928 by medical doctor Isaac Y Olch, whose intern had noticed elevated calcium levels in an elderly patient with muscle weakness. Prior to this surgery, patients with removed parathyroid glands typically died from muscular tetany.

Parathyroid hormone was isolated in 1923 by Adolph M. Hanson and 1925 by James B. Collip. Studies of parathyroid hormone levels by Roger Guillemin, Andrew Schally and Rosalyn Sussman Yalow led to the development of immunoassays capable of measuring body substances and a Nobel Prize in 1977.

==Other animals==
Parathyroid glands are found in all adult tetrapods; they vary in their number and position. Mammals typically have four parathyroid glands, while other types of animals typically have six. The removal of parathyroid glands in animals produces a condition resembling acute poisoning with irregular muscle contractions.

Fish do not possess parathyroid glands; several species have been found to express parathyroid hormone. Developmental genes and calcium-sensing receptors in fish gills are similar to those within the parathyroid glands of birds and mammals. It has been suggested that the tetrapod glands may have been evolutionarily derived from these fish gills.

<doc id="291120" wikidata="Q955405" url="?curid=291120" title="P. J. Kennedy">
<text>Patrick Joseph Kennedy (January 14, 1858 – May 18, 1929) was an American businessman and politician from Boston, Massachusetts. He and his wife Mary were the parents of four children, including future U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair and U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. Their grandchildren through Joseph include U.S. President John F. Kennedy, U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and longtime U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy.

After cholera killed his father and brother, Kennedy was the only surviving male in his family. He started work at age fourteen and became a successful businessman, later owning three saloons and a whisky import house. Eventually, he had major interests in coal and banking as well. Kennedy was a major figure in the Democratic Party in Boston. Though he served in both the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the state Senate, he preferred to play a behind-the-scenes role as a party boss.

== Early life ==

Patrick Joseph Kennedy was born on January 14, 1858, in Boston, Massachusetts. He was the youngest of five children born to Patrick Kennedy (1823–1858) and Bridget Kennedy (née Murphy) (1824–1888). His parents were Irish Catholic immigrants who were both from New Ross, County Wexford and emigrated to America together to flee the Great Famine in Ireland. The couple&#x27;s elder son John had died of cholera in infancy two years before Kennedy was born. Ten months after P. J. Kennedy&#x27;s birth, his father Patrick also succumbed to the infectious epidemic that infested the family&#x27;s East Boston neighborhood. As the only surviving male, Kennedy was the first family member to receive a formal education, attending Sacred Heart, a private Catholic school in Boston. His mother Bridget had purchased an East Boston stationery and notions store where she had worked. The business took off and expanded into a grocery and liquor store.

At the age of fourteen, young Kennedy left school to help support his mother and three older sisters, Mary, Joanna, and Margaret, as a stevedore on the Boston docks. In the 1880s, with money he had saved from his modest earnings and help from his mother Bridget, he launched a business career by buying a saloon in the Haymarket Square neighborhood near downtown Boston. In time, he bought a second establishment by the East Boston docks. Next, to capitalize on the social drinking of upper-class Bostonians, Kennedy purchased a third bar in an upscale East Boston hotel, the Maverick House. Before he was 30, his growing prosperity allowed him to buy a whiskey-importing business.

== Marriage and children ==
On November 23, 1887, Kennedy married Mary Augusta Hickey. The couple had four children and remained married until Hickey&#x27;s death on May 20, 1923. His wealth afforded them a home on Jeffries Point in East Boston.

== Political career ==

Kennedy was, as Robert Dallek describes: &quot;always ready to help less fortunate fellow Irishmen with a little cash and some sensible advice.&quot; A sociable man able to mix comfortably with both the Roman Catholic and the Protestant elite, Kennedy moved successfully into politics. Beginning in 1884, he converted his popularity into service as a Democrat, a minority in the then Republican dominant power in the Massachusetts General Court. Kennedy served five single year terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and then three two-year terms in the Massachusetts Senate. He found success as a Democratic Leader of Boston, which led him to giving a seconding speech for Grover Cleveland at the 1888 Democratic National Convention held at St. Louis. More drawn to the behind the scenes of work of politics in Boston, Kennedy left the Massachusetts Senate in 1895 and spent time as an appointed elections commissioner and city fire commissioner as the backroom boss of Boston&#x27;s Ward Two, as well as serving in the Democratic party&#x27;s unofficial Board of Strategy with three other power brokers.

== Death ==
By the time of his death in 1929, Kennedy held an interest in a coal company and a substantial amount of stock in a bank, the Columbia Trust Company.

In his later years, Kennedy developed degenerative liver disease. In April 1929, he was admitted to Deaconess Hospital to receive treatment. He died there on May 18 at the age of 71. His funeral was held at St. John the Evangelist Church in Winthrop, Massachusetts, on May 21. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that hundreds of mourners lined the streets to watch Kennedy&#x27;s funeral procession and businesses in East Boston closed to honor him. Kennedy is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Malden, Massachusetts.

== Legacy ==
In 1914, P. J. Kennedy&#x27;s son Joseph married Rose Fitzgerald (July 22, 1890 – January 22, 1995), the eldest daughter of Boston Mayor John F. Fitzgerald (1863–1950). Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. went on to become a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair and a U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom.

Joseph and Rose Kennedy had nine children, including World War II casualty Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., U.S. President John F. Kennedy, U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy.

<text>The hazelnut is the fruit of the hazel tree and therefore includes any of the nuts deriving from species of the genus &quot;Corylus&quot;, especially the nuts of the species &quot;Corylus avellana&quot;. They are also known as cobnuts or filberts according to species.

Hazelnuts are used as a snack food, in baking and desserts, and in breakfast cereals such as muesli. In confectionery, they are used to make praline, and also used in combination with chocolate for chocolate truffles and products such as chocolate bars and hazelnut cocoa spreads such as Nutella. They are also used in Frangelico liqueur. Hazelnut oil, pressed from hazelnuts, is strongly flavored and high in monounsaturated fat. It is used as a cooking oil and as a salad or vegetable dressing. 

Turkey is the world&#x27;s largest producer of hazelnuts, accounting for 58% of total production in 2023.

==Description==
A hazelnut cob is roughly spherical to oval, about long and in diameter, with an outer fibrous husk surrounding a smooth shell, while a filbert is more elongated, being about twice as long as its diameter. The nut falls out of the husk when ripe, about seven to eight months after pollination. The seed is edible and consumed raw, roasted or ground into a paste. The seed has a thin, dark brown skin, which is sometimes removed before cooking.

== Cultivation ==

=== History ===
In 1995, evidence of large-scale Mesolithic nut processing, some 8,000 years old, was found in a midden pit on the island of Colonsay in Scotland. The evidence consists of a large, shallow pit full of the remains of hundreds of thousands of burned hazelnut shells. Hazelnuts have been found on other Mesolithic sites, but rarely in such quantities or concentrated in one pit. The nuts were radiocarbon dated to 7720±110 BP, which calibrates to . Similar sites in Britain are known only at Farnham in Surrey and Cass ny Hawin on the Isle of Man.

This discovery gives an insight into communal activity and planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a single year, and pollen analysis suggests that all of the hazel trees were cut down at the same time.

The scale of the activity and the lack of large game on the island suggest that Colonsay may have contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island. Originally, the pit was on a beach close to the shore and was associated with two smaller, stone-lined pits whose function remains obscure, a hearth and a second cluster of pits.

The traditional method to increase nut production is called &quot;brutting&quot;, which involves prompting more of the tree&#x27;s energy to go into flower bud production by snapping, but not breaking off, the tips of the new year shoots six or seven leaf groups from where they join with the trunk or branch, at the end of the growing season. The traditional term for an area of cultivated hazelnuts is a &quot;plat&quot;.

=== Cultivars ===
The many cultivars of the hazel include &#x27;Atababa&#x27;, &#x27;Barcelona&#x27;, &#x27;Butler&#x27;, &#x27;Casina&#x27;, &#x27;Clark&#x27;, &#x27;Cosford&#x27;, &#x27;Daviana&#x27;, &#x27;Delle Langhe&#x27;, &#x27;England&#x27;, &#x27;Ennis&#x27;, &#x27;Halls Giant&#x27;, &#x27;Jemtegaard&#x27;, &#x27;Kent Cob&#x27;, &#x27;Lewis&#x27;, &#x27;Tokolyi&#x27;, &#x27;Tonda Gentile&#x27;, &#x27;Tonda di Giffoni&#x27;, &#x27;Tonda Romana&#x27;, &#x27;Wanliss Pride&#x27;, and &#x27;Willamette&#x27;. Some of these are grown for specific qualities of the nut, including large nut size or early or late fruiting, whereas others are grown as pollinators. The majority of commercial hazelnuts are propagated from root sprouts. Some cultivars are of hybrid origin between common hazel and filbert.

In Ireland and the United Kingdom, hazelnuts are sometimes referred to as cobnuts, for which a specific cultivated variety – Kentish cobnuts – is the main variety cultivated in fields known as plats, hand-picked, and eaten green. According to the BBC, a national collection of cobnut varieties exists at Roughway Farm, near Plaxtol in Kent. They are called cobnuts because cob was a word used to refer to the head or &quot;noggin,” and children had a game in which they would tie a string to a hazelnut and use it to try to hit an opponent on the head.

=== Cropping system ===
In Europe hazelnuts are traditionally grown as multi-trunk trees where the rootstock is formed by the variety itself. To enhance the possibility for mechanization and to prevent suckering, a single-trunk tree can be formed by grafting a scion of the desired variety on a &quot;Corylus colurna&quot; rootstock.
There are different approaches in orchard floor management. Strong infestations of certain weeds can lower the yield. Therefore, to prevent yield loss by competition, herbicides are used to create bare soil. Using cover crops protects the soil and suppresses weed establishment without a yield reduction.

Silvopastoral systems where animals like pigs are kept in the orchard or silvoarable systems where crops are grown between the rows could introduce new sources of revenue into the hazelnut production and may have beneficial effects on hazelnut yield by fertilizing the soil through nitrogen fixation or animal dung. These systems limit the plant protection measures, potentially impacting the yield quality and level. There are very few studies on these systems, leading to a higher uncertainty for the producer.

=== Harvesting ===

Hazelnuts are harvested annually in mid-autumn. As autumn comes to a close, the trees drop their nuts and leaves. Most commercial growers wait for the nuts to drop rather than using equipment to shake them from the tree. The harvesting of hazelnuts is performed either by hand or by manual or mechanical raking of fallen nuts.

Four primary pieces of equipment are used in commercial harvesting: the sweeper, the harvester, the nut cart, and the forklift. The sweeper moves the nuts into the center of the rows, the harvester lifts and separates the nuts from any debris (i.e., twigs and leaves), the nut cart holds the nuts picked up by the harvester, and the forklift brings a tote to offload the nuts from the nut cart and then stacks the totes to be shipped to the processor (nut dryer).
The sweeper is a low-to-the-ground machine that makes two passes in each tree row. It has a belt attached to the front that rotates to sweep leaves, nuts, and small twigs from left to right, depositing the material in the center of the row as it drives forward. On the rear of the sweeper is a powerful blower to blow material left into the adjacent row with air speeds up to . Careful grooming during the year and patient blowing at harvest may eliminate the need for hand raking around the tree trunk, where nuts may accumulate. The sweeper prepares a single center row of nuts, narrow enough for the harvesting tractor to drive over without driving on the center row. It is best to sweep only a few rows ahead of the harvesters at any given time, to prevent the tractor that drives the harvester from crushing the nuts that may still be falling from the trees. Hazelnut orchards may be harvested up to three times during the harvest season, depending on the number of nuts in the trees and the rate of nut drop due to the weather.

The harvester is a slow-moving machine pushed by a tractor, which lifts the material off the ground and separates the nuts from the leaves, empty husks, and twigs. As the harvester drives over the rows, a rotating cylinder with hundreds of tines rakes the material onto a belt. The belt takes the material over a blower and under a powerful vacuum that sucks any lightweight soil, leaves from the nuts, and discharges them into the orchard. The remaining nuts are conveyed into a cart pulled behind the harvester. Once a tote is filled with nuts, the forklift hauls away the full totes and brings empty ones back to the harvester to maximize the harvester&#x27;s time.

Two different timing strategies are used for collecting the fallen nuts. The first is to harvest early when about half of the nuts have fallen. With less material on the ground, the harvester can work faster with less chance of a breakdown. The second option is to wait for all the nuts to fall before harvesting. Although the first option is considered the better of the two, two or three passes do take more time to complete than one.

== Production ==
In 2023, world production of hazelnuts (in shells) was 1.13 million tonnes led by Turkey with 58% of the total, and Italy and the United States as other major producers (table).

==Food==
Hazelnuts are used in confections to make pralines, chocolate truffles, and hazelnut paste products. The (solid) combination of ground hazelnuts with chocolate is called &quot;gianduja&quot;. In Austria, hazelnut paste is an ingredient for making tortes, such as Viennese hazelnut torte. In Kyiv cake, hazelnut flour is used to flavor its meringue body, and crushed hazelnuts are sprinkled over its sides. &quot;Dacquoise&quot;, a French dessert cake, often contains a layer of hazelnut meringue. Hazelnuts are used in Turkish cuisine and Georgian cuisine; the snack &quot;churchkhela&quot; and sauce &quot;satsivi&quot; are used, often with walnuts. Hazelnuts are also a common constituent of muesli. The nuts may be eaten fresh or dried, having different flavors.

=== Nutrition ===

Raw hazelnuts are 5% water, 61% fat, 17% carbohydrates, and 15% protein (table).

In a reference amount, raw hazelnuts supply of food energy and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of numerous essential nutrients (see table).

Hazelnuts contain particularly high amounts of protein, dietary fiber, vitamin E, iron, thiamin, phosphorus, manganese, and magnesium, all exceeding 30% DV (table). Several B vitamins have appreciable content. In lesser but still significant amounts (moderate content, 10–19% DV) are vitamin K, calcium, zinc, and potassium (table).

Hazelnuts are a rich source of dietary fat, accounting for 93% DV in a 100-gram amount. The fat components are monounsaturated fat as oleic acid (75% of total), polyunsaturated fat mainly as linoleic acid (13% of total), and saturated fat, mainly as palmitic acid and stearic acid (together, 7% of total).

==In culture==
The hazelnut is used as a literary device by Julian of Norwich (c. 1343 – after 1416) within her mystical Christian treatise &quot;Revelations of Divine Love&quot;. The hazelnut shell is imagined as a chariot for the fairy Queen Mab within English playwright and poet William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The hazel fruit is also used as a metaphorical device in the poem &quot;To Autumn&quot; by the English Romantic poet John Keats.

<doc id="291126" wikidata="Q1351927" url="?curid=291126" title="Smart mob">
<text>A smart mob is a group whose coordination and communication abilities have been empowered by digital communication technologies. Smart mobs are particularly known for their ability to mobilize quickly.

The concept was introduced by Howard Rheingold in his 2002 book &quot;Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution&quot;. Rheingold defined the smart mob as follows: &quot;Smart mobs consist of people who are able to act in concert even if they don’t know each other... because they carry devices that possess both communication and computing capabilities&quot;. In December of that year, the &quot;smart mob&quot; concept was highlighted in the &quot;New York Times&quot; &quot;Year in Ideas&quot;.

==Characteristics==
These technologies that empower smart mobs include the Internet, computer-mediated communication such as Internet Relay Chat, and wireless devices like mobile phones and personal digital assistants. Methodologies like peer-to-peer networks and ubiquitous computing are also changing the ways in which people organize and share information.

Flash mobs are a specific form of smart mob, originally describing a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, do something unusual and pointless for a brief period of time, then quickly disperse. The difference between flash and smart mobs is primarily with regards to their duration: flash mobs disappear quickly, but smart mobs can have a more enduring presence. The term &quot;flash mob&quot; is claimed to have been inspired by &quot;smart mob&quot;.

Smart mobs have begun to have an impact in current events, as mobile phones and text messages have empowered everyone from revolutionaries in Malaysia to individuals protesting the second Iraq War. Individuals who have divergent worldviews and methods have been able to coordinate short-term.

A 2009 entry in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology&quot; noted that the term may be &quot;fading from public use&quot;.

==Early instances==
A forerunner to the idea can be found in the work of anarchist thinker Kropotkin, &quot;fishermen, hunters, travelling merchants, builders, or settled craftsmen came together for a common pursuit.&quot;

According to CNN, the first smart mobs were teenage &quot;thumb tribes&quot; in Tokyo and Helsinki who used text messaging on cell phones to organize impromptu raves or to stalk celebrities. For instance, in Tokyo, crowds of teenage fans would assemble seemingly spontaneously at subway stops where a rock musician was rumored to be headed.

However, an even earlier example is the &quot;Dîner en blanc&quot; phenomenon, which has taken place annually in Paris, France, since 1988, for one night around the end of June. The invited guests wear only white clothes and gather at a chosen spot, knowledge of which they have only a short time beforehand. They bring along food, drink, chairs and a table and the whole group then gathers to have a meal, after which they disperse. The event has been held each year in different places in the centre of Paris. It is not a normal cultural event because it is not advertised and only those who have received an invite attend—information on the chosen location is transferred by text message or more recently Twitter. The number of people attending has grown, in 2011, to over 10,000. &quot;Dîner en blanc&quot; would be considered a smart mob rather than a flash mob, because the event lasts for several hours.

The Professional Contractors Group organised the first smart mob in the UK in 2000 when 700 contractors turned up at The House of Commons to lobby their MP following an email sent out a few days before.

In the days after the U.S. presidential election of 2000, online activist Zack Exley anonymously created a website that allowed people to suggest locations for gatherings to protest for a full recount of the votes in Florida. On the first Saturday after the election, more than 100 significant protests took place—many with thousands of participants—without any traditional organizing effort. Exley wrote in December 2000 that the self-organized protests &quot;demonstrated that a fundamental change is taking place in our national political life. It&#x27;s not the Internet per se, but the emerging potential for any individual to communicate—for free and anonymously if necessary—with any other individual.&quot;

In the Philippines in 2001, a group of protesters organized via text messaging gathered at the EDSA Shrine, the site of the 1986 revolution that overthrew Ferdinand Marcos, to protest the corruption of President Joseph Estrada. The protest grew quickly, and Estrada was soon removed from office.

The Critical Mass bicycling events, dating back to 1992, are also sometimes compared to smart mobs, due to their self-organizing manner of assembly.

==Examples==
Essentially, the smart mob is a practical implementation of collective intelligence. According to Rheingold, examples of smart mobs are the street protests organized by the anti-globalization movement. The Free State Project has been described in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; as an example of potential &quot;smart mob rule&quot;. Other examples of smart mobs include:

*Smart mobs who arrange the meet up over the internet and show up at a retailer at a specific time and use their number to negotiate a discount with the retailer.
*Crop mobs, a group of agricultural volunteers who help out at a small farm
*Text messages that were sent in the Philippines, which are thought to be partly responsible for the demonstration that ousted former President Joseph Estrada. Examples of such a text message read &quot;Wear black to mourn the death of democracy&quot;, &quot;Expect there to be rumbles&quot; and &quot;Go to EDSA&quot;.
*The 11 March 2004 Madrid attacks (11M), and the reaction from the people against the government in the Spanish elections of 14 March 2004.
*The 2005 civil unrest in France exhibited smart mobs—the French national police spokesman, Patrick Hamon, was quoted in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; as saying that youths, mainly those of the Muslim faith, in individual neighborhoods were communicating by cellphone text messages, online blogs, and/or email—arranging meetings and warning each other about police operations.
*The 2006 student protests in Chile and 2007 Chilean government-Microsoft agreement are the example in Latin America about the smart mobs and the use of weblogs, Fotologs, Photoblogs, text messages and digital organization in a few hours. Also due to their online organization has called the attention of the press as a source of news because of the strong activism online.
*On July 5, 2005, during U2&#x27;s performance of the song &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot; at a stadium in Chorzów, Poland, the audience of 70,000 waved colored articles of clothing to form a giant Polish flag of white and red: fans on the pitch waved red, those in the bleachers waved white. This behavior was coordinated by fans communicating on the internet.
*On November 6, 2008, more than 500 students across Taiwan began a sit-in protest in front of the Executive Yuan. Known as the Wild Strawberry Students Movement 野草莓學運, this assembly was mobilised overnight with the help of an on-line Bulletin Board System (BBS). The students were equipped with mobile technology such as HSDPA (high speed download packet access) and web-cameras. They soon set up a live broadcast that aired for 24 hours a day over the internet for more than a week, and they used mobile devices to keep up to date with government reactions on the mass media. One of the main themes of the protest was for amendment of the Assembly and Parade Law that curbed freedom of expression: this demand earned support from various non-government organizations nationwide.
*The release of the Baauer song &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; was a smart mob phenomena in 2013. The song reached 700 million views in the month of February 2013 on YouTube. The song and dance has influences from a dance originally released in the 1980s. The phenomenon involves large groups of people banding together, utilizing their weak ties, and all filming a video dancing to &quot;Harlem Shake&quot;. On February 10, 2013, the upload rate of the &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; videos was 4,000 per day onto YouTube. The increasing popularity has enabled the video to become used as a political statement, such as in Egypt, where a smart mob formed to perform the dance outside the Egyptian Islamic president&#x27;s headquarters. According to Rhinegold&#x27;s characteristics of what makes a smart mob, such as a lack of centralized control and peer-to-peer influence, the &quot;Harlem Shake&quot; is the epitome of a smart mob.

==In popular culture==
The comic book &quot;Global Frequency&quot;, written by Warren Ellis, describes a covert, non-governmental intelligence organization built around a smart mob of people that are called on to provide individual expertise in solving extraordinary crises.

David Brin&#x27;s speculative science fiction novel, &quot;Existence&quot; (), similarly posits the use of on-the-fly smart mobs by credible journalists as sources of information and expertise.

<doc id="291130" wikidata="Q858661" url="?curid=291130" title="Big Chicken">
<text>The Big Chicken is a KFC restaurant in Marietta, Georgia, which features a steel-sided structure designed in the appearance of a chicken rising up from the top of the building. It is located at the intersection of Cobb Parkway (U.S. 41/Georgia 3) and Roswell Road (Georgia 120) and is a well-known landmark in the area. Constructed in 1963, it was rebuilt following storm damage in 1993 and underwent a $2 million renovation project in 2017.

==History==

The restaurant was built in 1963 at 12 Cobb Parkway, on the newly constructed stretch of Highway 41, the first divided highway in Cobb County. Taking advantage of the prime location on the new and quicker route for travelers on U.S. 41, Johnny Reb&#x27;s Chick, Chuck and Shake owner S. R. &quot;Tubby&quot; Davis erected the 56-foot (17-meter) tall structure over his restaurant in 1963 as a method of advertising. The novelty architecture was designed by Hubert Puckett, a Georgia Tech student of architecture, and fabricated by Atlantic Steel in nearby Atlanta (of which Marietta is a suburb). Davis later sold it to his brother, and it subsequently became a franchise of KFC.

In January 1993, storm winds damaged the structure, and rather than tear it down KFC was forced by public outcry to re-erect the building. Among those who complained about the Big Chicken being torn down were pilots, who used the building as a reference point when approaching Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport and Dobbins Air Reserve Base. The new Big Chicken includes the original design of beak and eyes which move, although this time the vibrations which plagued the first structure (even to the point of breaking windows) have been eliminated. Pieces of the original structure were sold to collectors as souvenirs. In early April 2006, the structure narrowly escaped a small eastward-moving nighttime tornado, which overturned a tractor-trailer at a Kmart across the street, and damaged another building nearby.

In early 2017 it was announced that The Big Chicken would undergo a twelve-week, $2 million renovation, incorporating the chain&#x27;s newest design and a gift shop. The renovations began January 23, 2017. The restaurant reopened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 11, 2017.

==Culture==

The Big Chicken has become one of the most well-recognized landmarks in Marietta, and has an established history of impacting the local culture of the area. Inside the building exists a gift shop selling souvenirs emblazoned with the monument and holding it comparable to other landmarks worldwide such as Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower. A board game featuring the Big Chicken and other local landmarks was produced in 1985 as part of a promotion for the city of Marietta. There is a barbershop-style singing group called the Big Chicken Chorus, formed in 1986, which gives concerts throughout the year. There is also a Marietta-based band called The Big Chicken Beatles Band which performs often at town activities. The Big Chicken was also featured on a promotional card in &quot;Sim City: The Card Game&quot;, and has appeared in the comic strip &quot;Zippy the Pinhead&quot; as a part of artist Bill Griffith&#x27;s fascination with roadside icons.

The Big Chicken is also commonly used as a landmark for driving directions. Locals will often include &quot;make a [turn] at the Big Chicken&quot;, or &quot;it&#x27;s about &quot;x&quot; miles past the Big Chicken&quot;. This is referenced in music video game &quot;Rock Band 3&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Road Challenge Mode&quot;, when the player is told &quot;Don&#x27;t be alarmed if you&#x27;re asking for directions in the bus and the locals tell you to &#x27;turn left at the Big Chicken&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="291132" wikidata="Q313696" url="?curid=291132" title="Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.">
<text>Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr. (September 6, 1888 – November 18, 1969) was an American businessman, investor, philanthropist, and politician. He is known for his own political prominence as well as that of his children and was a patriarch of the Kennedy family, which included President John F. Kennedy, attorney general and senator Robert F. Kennedy, and longtime senator Ted Kennedy.

Kennedy was born into a political family in East Boston, Massachusetts. He made a large fortune as a stock and commodity market investor, and later rolled over his proceeds by dedicating a substantial amount of his wealth into investment-grade real estate and a wide range of privately controlled businesses across the United States. During World War I he was an assistant general manager of a Boston area Bethlehem Steel shipyard; through that position he became acquainted with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In the 1920s Kennedy made huge profits by reorganizing and refinancing several Hollywood studios; several acquisitions were ultimately merged into Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) studios. Kennedy increased his fortune with distribution rights for Scotch whisky. He owned the largest privately owned building in the country, Chicago&#x27;s Merchandise Mart.

Kennedy was a leading member of the Democratic Party and of the Irish Catholic community. President Roosevelt appointed Kennedy to be the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he led from 1934 to 1935. Kennedy later directed the United States Maritime Commission. Kennedy served as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1938 to late 1940. With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Kennedy was pessimistic about Britain&#x27;s ability to survive attacks from Nazi Germany. During the Battle of Britain in November 1940, Kennedy publicly suggested, &quot;Democracy is finished in England. It may be here [in the United States].&quot; After a controversy regarding this statement, Kennedy resigned his position.

Kennedy was married to Rose Fitzgerald; the couple had nine children. During his later life he was heavily involved in the political careers of his sons. Three of Kennedy&#x27;s sons attained distinguished political positions: John served as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and as the 35th president of the United States, Robert as the U.S. attorney general and as a U.S. senator from New York, and Ted as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts.

==Early life and education==

Joseph Patrick Kennedy Sr. was born on September 6, 1888, at 151 Meridian Street in East Boston, Massachusetts. Kennedy was the elder son of Mary Augusta (née Hickey) Kennedy and businessman and politician Patrick Joseph &quot;P.J.&quot; Kennedy. Kennedy attended Boston Latin School, where he excelled at baseball and was elected class president before graduating in 1908.

Kennedy then attended Harvard College, where he gained admittance to the prestigious Hasty Pudding Club but was not invited to join the Porcellian Club. Kennedy graduated in 1912 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics.

==Business career==
Kennedy set his future sights on embarking on a business career upon his graduation from Harvard. During his mid to late 20s, he made a large fortune as an active commodity and stock investor; he then reinvested much of his proceeds into film studios, real estate, and shipping lines. Although Kennedy never built a significant business from scratch, his timing as both buyer and seller was excellent.

Various criminals, such as Frank Costello, have boasted they worked with Kennedy in mysterious bootlegging operations during Prohibition. Although his father was in the whisky importation business, scholars dismiss the claims. The most recent and most thorough biographer David Nasaw asserts that no credible evidence has been found to link Kennedy to bootlegging activities. When &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine published its first list of the richest people in the United States in 1957, it placed Kennedy in the $200–400 million group, which is equivalent to roughly 3.2 billion dollars in 2023.

===Early ventures===
Kennedy&#x27;s first job after graduating from Harvard was a position as a state-employed bank examiner, where the job allowed him to learn a great deal about the banking industry. In 1913, the Columbia Trust Bank, in which his father held a significant share, was under threat of takeover. Kennedy borrowed $45,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) from family and friends and bought back control. At the age of 25, he was rewarded by being elected the bank&#x27;s president. Kennedy told the press he was &quot;the youngest&quot; bank president in America. In May 1917, Kennedy was elected to the Board of Trustees of the Massachusetts Electric Company, New England&#x27;s leading public utility at the time.

Kennedy emerged as an astute businessman who possessed an eye for value, both with regard to his shrewd entrepreneurial acumen and savvy investment foresight. For example, as an active real estate investor, he turned a handsome profit from his privately controlled ownership of Old Colony Realty Associates, Inc., an investment company which bought distressed real estate throughout the United States.

Although he was skeptical of American involvement in World War I, Kennedy sought to participate in wartime production as an assistant general manager of Fore River, a major Bethlehem Steel shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. There, he oversaw the production of transports and warships. Through this job, he became acquainted with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt.

===Wall Street and stock market investments===
In 1919, Kennedy joined Hayden, Stone &amp; Co., a prominent stock brokerage firm with offices in Boston and New York, where he became an expert dealing in the unregulated stock market of the day, engaging in tactics that were later considered to be insider trading and market manipulation violations. He happened to be on the corner of Wall and Broad Streets at the moment of the Wall Street bombing on September 16, 1920, and was thrown to the ground by the force of the blast. In 1923, he established his own investment company. Kennedy subsequently became a multi-millionaire as a result of taking &quot;short&quot; positions following the 1929 stock market crash.

Kennedy was enlisted in 1924 to help stabilize the stock of John D. Hertz&#x27;s Yellow Cab Company, a taxi cab operator, against a bear raid; afterward, Hertz suspected Kennedy of carrying out such a raid against the stock himself. In 1933, he helped establish a &quot;stock pool&quot; that bought large quantities of stock in Libbey-Owens-Ford (LOF), an auto-glass manufacturer, and wash-traded huge volumes of stock among themselves while promoting the outright fraud that their company was related to Owens-Illinois, a glassmaker that made bottles which presumably would have profited from the imminent repeal of Prohibition.

====1929 Wall Street Crash====
Kennedy later claimed he understood that the rampant stock speculation of the late 1920s would lead to a market crash. It is said that he knew it was time to get out of the market when he received stock tips from a shoe-shine boy, but no evidence has been found of the anecdote and the first known version of the same tale was associated to Bernard Baruch in 1957. Kennedy survived the crash &quot;because he possessed a passion for facts, a complete lack of sentiment and a marvelous sense of timing&quot;.

During the Great Depression, Kennedy shrewdly increased his wealth by devoting most of it into investment-grade real estate. In 1929, Kennedy&#x27;s fortune was estimated to be $4 million (equivalent to $ million in ). By 1935, his wealth had increased to $180 million (equivalent to $ in ). He also acquired enough capital to establish million-dollar trust funds for each of his nine children that guaranteed lifelong financial independence.

===Investments===
====Hollywood====

Kennedy generated windfall profits from reorganizing and refinancing several Hollywood film studios. He began with film distribution in New England, buying first movie theaters in Massachusetts, but quickly moved on to industry-wide arrangements and production. While still at Hayden, Stone &amp; Co., Kennedy boasted to a colleague, &quot;Look at that bunch of pants pressers in Hollywood making themselves millionaires. I could take the whole business away from them.&quot; One small studio, Film Booking Offices of America (or FBO), specialized in Westerns produced cheaply. Its owner was in financial trouble, and asked Kennedy to help find a new owner. Kennedy formed his own group of investors and bought it for $1.5 million.

In March 1926, Kennedy moved to Hollywood to focus on running film studios. At that time, film studios were permitted to own exhibition companies, which were necessary to get their films on local screens. With that in mind, he bought controlling shares in Keith-Albee-Orpheum Theaters Corporation (KAO), which had more than 700 vaudeville theaters across the United States that had begun showing movies. In October 1928, he formally merged his film companies FBO and KAO to form Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) and made a large amount of money in the process. Kennedy had no interest in vaudeville; he just wanted the theaters, which he planned to convert to movie houses for the film booking interests he ran in cooperation with Radio Corporation of America (RCA). As the developer of photophone, a sound system for the new &quot;talkies&quot;, RCA needed to forge a connection with Hollywood to sell its product. At the same time Kennedy knew that he needed to compete in the new market of sound films and to do so he would have to have access to a technology that was not proprietary.

Keen to buy the Pantages Theatre chain, which had 63 profitable theaters, Kennedy made an offer of $8 million (equivalent to $ million in ). It was declined. He then stopped distributing his movies to Pantages. Still, Alexander Pantages declined to sell. However, when Pantages was later charged and tried for rape, his reputation took a battering, and he accepted Kennedy&#x27;s revised offer of $3.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Pantages, who claimed that Kennedy had &quot;set him up&quot;, was later found not guilty at a second trial. The girl who had accused Pantages of rape, Eunice Pringle, confessed on her deathbed that Kennedy was the mastermind of the plot to frame Pantages.

Many estimate that Kennedy made over $5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) from his investments in Hollywood. During his three-year affair with film star Gloria Swanson, he arranged the financing for her films &quot;The Love of Sunya&quot; (1927) and the ill-fated &quot;Queen Kelly&quot; (1928). The duo also used Hollywood&#x27;s famous &quot;body sculptor&quot;, masseuse Sylvia of Hollywood. Their relationship ended when Swanson discovered that an expensive gift from Kennedy had actually been charged to her account.

====Liquor importing====
As soon as it became legal to do so, Kennedy ventured into liquor importing. One of his shipping ventures he was involved in was the importation of large shipments of high-priced Scotch where he earned a handsome profit in the process. Various contradictory &quot;bootlegging&quot; stories surrounding Kennedy have circulated but historians have not accepted them. At the start of the Franklin Roosevelt administration in March 1933, Kennedy and future Congressman James Roosevelt II founded Somerset Importers, a business entity that acted as the exclusive American agent for Haig &amp; Haig Scotch, Gordon&#x27;s Dry Gin and Dewar&#x27;s Scotch. Kennedy kept his Somerset company for years. In addition, Kennedy purchased spirits-importation rights from Schenley Industries, a Canadian distillery and liquor company. Though he possessed substantial investments in various shipping lines that imported significant shipments of liquor, Kennedy himself drank little alcohol. He so disapproved of what he considered a stereotypical Irish vice that he offered his sons $1,000 not to drink until they turned 21.

====Real estate====
Kennedy reinvested the proceeds he made from liquor importing into various residential and commercial real estate ventures, much of it concentrated in New York City, and the Hialeah Park Race Track in Hialeah, Florida. The most important purchase of his real estate investment career was marked by the land acquisition of the largest privately owned building in the country, Chicago&#x27;s Merchandise Mart (the world&#x27;s largest building at the time), which gave his family an important base in that city and an alliance with the Irish-American political leadership there to lay the groundwork for realizing his sons&#x27; future political ambitions. The Merchandise Mart&#x27;s revenues became a principal source of wealth that formed much of the Kennedy family&#x27;s private fortune, including being a source of funding for financing his sons&#x27; future political campaigns.

==Political career==
===SEC Chairman (1934–1935)===

In 1932, Kennedy supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in his bid for the presidency. This was his first major involvement in a national political campaign, and he donated, lent, and raised a substantial amount of money for the campaign.

In 1934, Congress established the independent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to end irresponsible market manipulations and dissemination of false information about securities. Roosevelt&#x27;s brain trust drew up a list of recommended candidates for the SEC chairmanship. Kennedy headed the list, which stated he was &quot;the best bet for Chairman because of executive ability, knowledge of habits and customs of business to be regulated and ability to moderate different points of view on Commission.&quot;

Kennedy sought out the best lawyers available, giving him a hard-driving team with a mission for reform. They included William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas, both of whom were later named to the Supreme Court. The SEC had four missions. First was to restore investor confidence in the securities market, which had collapsed on account of its questionability, and the external threats supposedly posed by anti-business elements in the Roosevelt administration. Second, the SEC had to get rid of penny-ante swindles based on false information, fraudulent devices, and get-rich-quick schemes. Thirdly, and much more important than the frauds, the SEC had to end the million-dollar maneuvers in major corporations, whereby insiders with access to high-quality information about the company knew when to buy or sell their own securities. A crackdown on insider trading was essential. Finally, the SEC had to set up a complex system of registration for all securities sold in America, with a clear set of rules, deadlines and guidelines that all companies had to follow. The main challenge faced by the young lawyers was drafting precise rules. The SEC succeeded in its four missions, as Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and taken advantage of by Wall Street. He trumpeted for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again. Kennedy&#x27;s reforming work as SEC Chairman was widely praised on all sides, as investors realized the SEC was protecting their interests. He resigned from the SEC in September 1935.

===Chairman of U.S. Maritime Commission (1937–1938)===
In 1936, Roosevelt sought Kennedy&#x27;s help on the campaign, and Kennedy responded with his book &quot;I&#x27;m for Roosevelt&quot;, which he had published and made sure was widely distributed. The book presented arguments for why businessmen should support Roosevelt and the New Deal, told from the perspective of Kennedy&#x27;s own personal endorsement. The book had significant impact in the business community and after his re-election, Roosevelt appointed Kennedy as Chairman of the United States Maritime Commission, which built on his wartime experience in running a major shipyard. Kennedy spent only ten months at the commission.

===Relationship with Father Charles Coughlin===

Father Charles Coughlin, an Irish Canadian priest near Detroit, became the most prominent Roman Catholic spokesman on political and financial issues in the 1930s, with a radio audience that reached millions every week. Having been a strong supporter of Roosevelt since 1932, in 1934 Coughlin broke with the president, who became a bitter opponent and a target of Coughlin&#x27;s weekly anti-communist, anti-Semitic, far-right, anti–Federal Reserve and isolationist radio talks. Roosevelt sent Kennedy and other prominent Irish Catholics to try to tone down Coughlin.

Coughlin swung his support to Huey Long in 1935, and then to William Lemke&#x27;s Union Party in 1936. Kennedy strongly supported the New Deal (Father Coughlin believed that the New Deal did not go far enough, and thought that Franklin Roosevelt was a tool of the rich) and reportedly believed as early as 1933 that Coughlin was &quot;becoming a very dangerous proposition&quot; as an opponent of Roosevelt and &quot;an out and out demagogue&quot;. In 1936, Kennedy worked with Roosevelt, Bishop Francis Spellman and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) to shut Coughlin down. When Coughlin returned to the air in 1940, Kennedy continued to battle against his influence among Irish Americans.

Despite his public disputes with Coughlin, it has also been acknowledged that Kennedy would also accompany Coughlin whenever the priest visited Roosevelt at Hyde Park. A historian with History News Network also stated that Coughlin was a friend of Kennedy as well. In a &quot;Boston Post&quot; article of August 16, 1936, Coughlin referred to Kennedy as the &quot;shining star among the dim &#x27;knights&#x27; in the [Roosevelt] Administration&quot;.

===Ambassador to the United Kingdom (1938–1940)===

In 1938, Roosevelt appointed Kennedy as the United States ambassador to the Court of St James&#x27;s (United Kingdom). Kennedy hoped to succeed Roosevelt in the White House, telling a British reporter in late 1939 that he was confident that Roosevelt would &quot;fall&quot; in 1940 (that year&#x27;s presidential election).

Kennedy and his family retreated to the countryside during the bombings of London by German aircraft in World War II. In so doing, he damaged his reputation with the British. This move prompted Randolph Churchill to say, &quot;I thought my daffodils were yellow until I met Joe Kennedy&quot;.

Kennedy developed a reputation as a defeatist.

====High society====
According to the U.S. National Archives:In London, the American Ambassador and his wife soared to the heights of British society. In the spring of 1938...the couple luxuriated in the warmth of English hospitality, hobnobbing with aristocrats and royalty at the many balls, dinners, regattas, and derbies of the season. The highlight was surely the April weekend that they spent at Windsor Castle, guests of King George VI and his wife, Queen Elizabeth.

While getting dressed for an evening at Windsor Castle soon after he arrived, Kennedy paused in momentary reflection and remarked to his wife, &quot;Well, Rose, this is a helluva long way from East Boston, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;

On May 6, 1944, Kennedy&#x27;s daughter, Kathleen, married William &quot;Billy&quot; Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, the elder son of the Duke of Devonshire. The union was disapproved by Rose Kennedy due to Hartington being an Anglican. Unable to reconcile their religious backgrounds, Hartington and Kathleen were married in a civil ceremony. Hartington, a major in the Coldstream Guards, was killed in action in 1944.

====Appeasement====
Kennedy rejected the belief of Winston Churchill that any compromise with Nazi Germany was impossible. Instead, he supported Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of appeasement. Throughout 1938, while the Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany intensified, Kennedy attempted to arrange a meeting with Adolf Hitler. Shortly before the Nazi bombing of British cities began in September 1940, Kennedy once again sought a personal meeting with Hitler without the approval of the U.S. Department of State, in order to &quot;bring about a better understanding between the United States and Germany&quot;.

====Anti-British sentiment====
When war came in September 1939, Kennedy&#x27;s public support for American neutrality conflicted with Roosevelt&#x27;s increasing efforts to provide aid to Britain. &quot;Democracy is finished in England. It may be here [in the United States]&quot;, he stated in the &quot;Boston Sunday Globe&quot; of November 10, 1940. With German troops having overrun Poland, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France, and with daily bombings of Great Britain, Kennedy unambiguously and repeatedly stated that the war was not about saving democracy from National Socialism (Nazism) or from Fascism. In an interview with two newspaper journalists, Louis M. Lyons of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and Ralph Coghlan of the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot;, Kennedy said:

====Isolationism====
Kennedy&#x27;s views became inconsistent and increasingly isolationist. British MP Josiah Wedgwood IV, who had himself opposed the British government&#x27;s earlier appeasement policy, said of Kennedy:

====Antisemitism====
According to Harvey Klemmer, who served as one of Kennedy&#x27;s embassy aides, Kennedy habitually referred to Jews as &quot;kikes or sheenies&quot;. Kennedy allegedly told Klemmer that &quot;[some] individual Jews are all right, Harvey, but as a race they stink. They spoil everything they touch.&quot; When Klemmer returned from a trip to Germany and reported the pattern of vandalism and assaults on Jews by Nazis, Kennedy responded, &quot;Well, they brought it on themselves.&quot;

On June 13, 1938, Kennedy met in London with Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador to the United Kingdom, who claimed upon his return to Berlin that Kennedy had told him that &quot;it was not so much the fact that we want to get rid of the Jews that was so harmful to us, but rather the loud clamor with which we accompanied this purpose. [Kennedy] himself fully understood our Jewish policy.&quot; Kennedy&#x27;s main concern with such violent acts against German Jews as &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; was that they generated bad publicity in the West for the Nazi regime, a concern that he communicated in a letter to Charles Lindbergh.

Kennedy had a close friendship with Viscountess Astor, and their correspondence is replete with anti-Semitic statements. According to Edward Renehan:

By August 1940, Kennedy worried that a third term for President Roosevelt would mean war. Biographer Laurence Leamer in &quot;The Kennedy Men: 1901–1963&quot; reports: &quot;Joe believed that Roosevelt, Churchill, the Jews, and their allies would manipulate America into approaching Armageddon.&quot; Nevertheless, Kennedy supported Roosevelt&#x27;s third term in return for Roosevelt&#x27;s promise to support Joseph Kennedy Jr. in a run for Governor of Massachusetts in 1942. However, even during the darkest months of World War II, Kennedy remained &quot;more wary of&quot; prominent American Jews, such as Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, than he was of Hitler.

Kennedy told the reporter Joe Dinneen:

====Resignation====
From late 1939 onwards, Kennedy began to suspect that Roosevelt and the State Department were excluding him from decision-making and communiqués pertinent to his ambassadorial duties. Roosevelt had started to communicate in secret with Winston Churchill (at this time First Lord of the Admiralty, later Prime Minister). In early 1940, Roosevelt also sent personal representatives (under Secretary of State Sumner Welles, and General William Donovan) on fact-finding missions to London and other European capitals, without advising Kennedy beforehand, thereby causing the ambassador great embarrassment and annoyance. As a result, Kennedy was, for much of 1940, determined to resign his post, although Roosevelt insisted he remain in London. In late October 1940, Roosevelt invited Kennedy to return to Washington for a pre-election consultation, Kennedy used this visit to announce his resignation. Kennedy agreed to make a nationwide radio speech to advocate Roosevelt&#x27;s reelection. Roosevelt was pleased with the speech because, Nasaw says, it &quot;rallied reluctant Irish Catholic voters to his side, buttressed his claims that he was not going to take the nation into war, and emphasized that he alone had the experience to lead the nation in these difficult times.&quot; Kennedy finally submitted his resignation at the White House on December 1, 1940, but agreed to remain Ambassador until a successor was chosen in early 1941.

For the rest of the war, relations between Kennedy and the Roosevelt administration remained tense, especially when Joe Jr., a Massachusetts delegate at the 1940 Democratic National Convention, vocally opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s unprecedented nomination for a third term, which began in 1941. Kennedy may have wanted to run for president himself in 1940 or later. Having effectively removed himself from the national stage, Joe Sr. spent World War II on the sidelines. Kennedy stayed active in the smaller venues of rallying Irish-American and Roman Catholic Democrats to vote for Roosevelt&#x27;s re-election for a fourth term in 1944. Kennedy claimed to be eager to help the war effort, but as a result of his previous gaffes, he was neither trusted nor invited to do so.

===Alliances===
Kennedy used his wealth and connections to build a national network of supporters that became the base for his sons&#x27; political careers. He especially concentrated on Irish-American communities in large cities, particularly Boston, New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh and several New Jersey cities. Kennedy also used Arthur Krock of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, America&#x27;s most influential political columnist, for decades as a paid speechwriter and political advisor.

A political conservative (John F. Kennedy once described his father as being to &quot;the right of Herbert Hoover&quot;), Kennedy supported Richard Nixon, who had entered Congress with John in 1947. In 1960, Joe Kennedy approached Nixon, praised his anti-Communism, and said &quot;Dick, if my boy can&#x27;t make it, I&#x27;m for you&quot; for the presidential election that year.

====Alliance with Senator Joseph McCarthy====
Kennedy&#x27;s close ties with Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin strengthened his family&#x27;s position among Irish Catholics, but weakened it among liberals who strongly opposed McCarthy. Even before McCarthy became famous in 1950, Kennedy had forged close ties with the Republican Senator. Kennedy often brought him to his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, as a weekend house guest in the late 1940s. McCarthy at one point dated his daughter Patricia.

When McCarthy became a dominant voice of anti-Communism starting in 1950, Kennedy contributed thousands of dollars to McCarthy, and became one of his major supporters. In the 1952 U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts, Kennedy apparently worked a deal so that McCarthy, a Republican, would not make campaign speeches for the Republican ticket in Massachusetts. In return, Congressman John F. Kennedy, running for the Senate seat, would not give any anti-McCarthy speeches that his liberal supporters wanted to hear.

At Kennedy&#x27;s urging in 1953, McCarthy hired his 27-year-old son, Robert F. Kennedy, as a senior staff member of the Senate&#x27;s investigations subcommittee, which McCarthy chaired. In 1954, when the Senate was threatening to condemn McCarthy, Senator John Kennedy faced a dilemma. &quot;How could I demand that Joe McCarthy be censured for things he did when my own brother was on his staff?&quot; asked John.

By 1954, Robert and McCarthy&#x27;s chief aide Roy Cohn had fallen out with each other, and Robert no longer worked for McCarthy. John had a speech drafted calling for the censure of McCarthy, but never delivered it. When the Senate voted to censure McCarthy on December 2, 1954, Senator Kennedy was in a hospital and never indicated how he would cast his vote. Joe Kennedy strongly supported McCarthy to the end.

===Involvement in sons&#x27; political careers===
Kennedy&#x27;s connections and influence were turned into political capital for the political campaigns of his sons: John, Robert, and Ted. Kennedy was influential in creating John&#x27;s cabinet, which included Robert as U.S. attorney general, although he had never argued or tried a case. He was one of four fathers (the other three being George Tryon Harding, Nathaniel Fillmore, and George H. W. Bush) to live through the entire presidency of a son.

Kennedy had been consigned to the political shadows after his remarks during World War II (&quot;Democracy is finished&quot;), and he remained an intensely controversial figure among U.S. citizens because of his suspect business credentials, his Roman Catholicism, his opposition to Roosevelt&#x27;s foreign policy, and his support for Joseph McCarthy. Although his own ambitions to achieve the U.S. presidency were thwarted, Kennedy held out great hope for his eldest son, Joe Jr., to seek the presidency. However, Joe Jr., who had become a U.S. Navy bomber pilot, was killed over the English Channel in August 1944 while undertaking Operation Anvil. After grieving over his dead son, Joe Sr. turned his attention to his second son, John, for a run for political office.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and children===
On October 7, 1914, Kennedy married Rose Fitzgerald, the eldest daughter of Boston Mayor John F. &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald, in the private chapel of Archbishop William Henry O&#x27;Connell in Boston. After a two-week honeymoon, the couple settled at 83 Beals Street in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts.

Joseph and Rose Kennedy had nine children: Joseph Jr. (1915–1944), John, called &quot;Jack&quot; (1917–1963), Rose Marie, called &quot;Rosemary&quot; (1918–2005), Kathleen, called &quot;Kick&quot; (1920–1948), Eunice (1921–2009), Patricia (1924–2006), Robert, called &quot;Bobby&quot; (1925–1968), Jean (1928–2020), and Edward, called &quot;Ted&quot; (1932–2009). Three of the Kennedys&#x27; sons attained distinguished political positions: John F. Kennedy served as a U.S. representative from Massachusetts (1947–1953), a U.S. senator from Massachusetts (1953–1960), and as 35th president of the United States (1961–1963); Robert F. Kennedy served as U.S. attorney general (1961–1964) and as a U.S. senator from New York (1965–1968); and Edward M. &quot;Ted&quot; Kennedy served as a U.S. senator from Massachusetts (1962–2009). One of the Kennedys&#x27; daughters, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics for disabled people, while another, Jean Kennedy Smith, served as U.S. ambassador to Ireland.

As Kennedy&#x27;s business success expanded, he and his family lived in increasing prosperity in Massachusetts, New York, around Washington, D.C., London, as well as the French Riviera. Their two permanent homes were located in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and Palm Beach, Florida.

Kennedy engaged in numerous extramarital relationships, including relationships with actresses Gloria Swanson and Marlene Dietrich and with his secretary, Janet DesRosiers Fontaine. He also managed Swanson&#x27;s personal and business affairs.

===Lobotomy of Rosemary Kennedy===
When Rosemary Kennedy was 23 years old, doctors told Joseph Kennedy Sr. that a form of psychosurgery known as a lobotomy would help calm her mood swings and stop her occasional violent outbursts. (Accounts of Rosemary&#x27;s life indicated that she was intellectually disabled, although some have raised questions about the Kennedys&#x27; accounts of the nature and scope of her disability.) Rosemary&#x27;s erratic behavior frustrated her parents; her father was especially worried that she would shame and embarrass the family and damage his political career and that of his other children. Kennedy requested that surgeons perform a lobotomy on Rosemary. The lobotomy took place in November 1941. Kennedy did not inform his wife about the procedure until after it was completed. James W. Watts and Walter Freeman (both of George Washington University School of Medicine) performed the surgery.

The lobotomy was a disaster, leaving Rosemary Kennedy permanently incapacitated. Her mental capacity diminished to that of a two-year-old child; she could not walk or speak intelligibly and was incontinent. Following the lobotomy, Rosemary was immediately institutionalized. In 1949, she was relocated to Jefferson, Wisconsin, where she lived for the rest of her life on the grounds of the St. Coletta School for Exceptional Children (formerly known as &quot;St. Coletta Institute for Backward Youth&quot;). Kennedy did not visit his daughter at the institution. In &quot;Rosemary: The Hidden Kennedy Daughter,&quot; author Kate Clifford Larson stated that Rosemary&#x27;s lobotomy was hidden from the family for twenty years. In 1961, after Kennedy suffered a stroke that left him unable to speak, his children were made aware of Rosemary&#x27;s location. The lobotomy did not become public knowledge until 1987. Rosemary Kennedy died from natural causes on January 7, 2005, at the age of 86.

Dr. Bertram S. Brown, director of the National Institute of Mental Health who was previously an aide to President Kennedy, told a Kennedy biographer that Kennedy referred to Rosemary as mentally retarded rather than mentally ill in order to protect his son John&#x27;s reputation for a presidential run. Brown added that the family&#x27;s &quot;lack of support for mental illness&quot; was &quot;part of a lifelong family denial of what was really so&quot;.

===Illness and death===

On December 19, 1961, at the age of 73, Kennedy suffered a stroke. He survived but was left paralyzed on his right side. Thereafter, he suffered from aphasia, which severely affected his ability to speak. He remained mentally alert, regained certain functions with therapy, and began walking with a cane. His speech also showed some improvement. Kennedy began to experience excessive muscular weakness, which eventually required him to use a wheelchair. In 1964, Kennedy was taken to The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential in Philadelphia, a medical and rehabilitative center for those who have experienced brain injury.

Kennedy&#x27;s son Robert was assassinated on June 5, 1968, while running for president. He died the following morning at the age of forty-two. In the aftermath of Robert&#x27;s death, Kennedy made his last public appearance when he, his wife, and son Ted made a filmed message to the country. He died at home in Hyannis Port the following year on November 18, 1969, two days before what would have been Robert&#x27;s 44th birthday. He was 81 years old. He had outlived four of his children. He is buried at Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline, Massachusetts. Kennedy&#x27;s widow Rose is buried next to him following her death in 1995 at age 104, as is their daughter Rosemary in 2005.

<text>John Francis &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; Fitzgerald (February 11, 1863 – October 2, 1950) was an American Democratic politician from Boston, Massachusetts. Fitzgerald served as mayor of Boston and a member of the United States House of Representatives. He also made unsuccessful runs for the United States Senate in 1916 and 1942 and governor of Massachusetts in 1922. Fitzgerald maintained a high profile in the city whether in or out of office, and his theatrical style of campaigning and charisma earned him the nickname &quot;Honey Fitz&quot;.

He was the father of Rose Fitzgerald and maternal grandfather of her sons President John F. Kennedy, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and Senator Ted Kennedy. In his old age, Fitzgerald helped his namesake grandson, John F. Kennedy, win his first election to Congress.

==Early life and education==
John Francis Fitzgerald was born on February 11, 1863, in the North End of Boston to Irish immigrant businessman and politician Thomas Fitzgerald of Bruff, County Limerick and Rose Anna Cox of Tonymore, Tomregan, Knockninny, County Fermanagh, Ireland. He was the fourth of twelve children. Both of his sisters, Ellen and Mary, and his eldest brother, Michael, died in infancy. Fitzgerald&#x27;s brother Joseph had severe brain damage from malaria. Only three of the children survived in good health.

Fitzgerald&#x27;s mother died when he was sixteen. His father wished for him to become a doctor to help prevent future deaths of the sort that had marred the family. Accordingly, after being educated at Boston Latin School and Boston College, he enrolled at Harvard Medical School for one year, but withdrew following the death of his father in 1885. Fitzgerald later became a clerk at the Customs House in Boston and was active in the local Democratic Party.

==Entry to politics==
In the 1890s, Fitzgerald founded the Jefferson Club, a political club founded to organize the Irish Catholic voters of South Boston. It was modeled on earlier clubs like Tammany Hall in New York and Martin Lomasney&#x27;s Hendricks Club in the West End of Boston. Fitzgerald won election to Boston&#x27;s Common Council in 1891. In 1892, he became a member of the Massachusetts Senate. These early victories came with support from Martin Lomasney.

== United States Representative ==
In 1894, he was elected to Congress for the 9th district, serving from 1895 to 1901. In his first two terms (1895–1899), Fitzgerald was the only Democrat to represent New England in Congress.

In 1901, Fitzgerald was one of three representatives, along with Charles H. Grosvenor and George Henry White, to argue in favor of reducing the size of southern delegations in accordance with the Fourteenth Amendment due to their suppression of voting rights for black people. This measure failed by a vote of 94 to 136.

==Mayor of Boston==
===First term (1906–1908)===
In December 1905, Fitzgerald was elected Mayor of Boston. In the process, he made an enemy of the powerful Lomasney by opposing one of Lomasney&#x27;s lieutenants, Edward J. Donovan. After Fitzgerald beat Donovan in the mayoral primary, Lomasney endorsed the Republican candidate, Louis Frothingham, and delivered 95% of the vote in his usually Democratic ward to Frothingham. However, the Republican vote was split between Frothingham and judge Henry Dewey, who ran on the Populist ticket after losing the primary. Fitzgerald won despite Lomasney&#x27;s undermining, though only with a plurality of the vote.

Another opponent of Fitzgerald&#x27;s during the campaign was P. J. Kennedy, a behind-the-scenes Democratic figure. They later became allies. In 1914, their families were united when P. J.&#x27;s son Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. married Fitzgerald&#x27;s eldest daughter Rose.

Fitzgerald was the first American-born Irish Catholic to be elected mayor.
According to Peter Jones, during his first term as mayor, Fitzgerald demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the city, actively advocating for the development of port and harbor facilities and promoting industrial growth. Under his leadership, the High School of Commerce for boys and the School of Practical Arts for girls were constructed, and he oversaw the establishment of numerous playgrounds, public baths, and other facilities that served large numbers of voters. He also engaged in corrupt practices, manipulating public contracts to create superfluous jobs for poorly credentialed friends. For instance, he appointed a tavern keeper and a bartender to superintendent positions for public buildings and streets, respectively, and his brother Henry managed the patronage department. The mayor&#x27;s tireless energy was on full display: in two years he attended around 1200 dinners, a thousand meetings, and 1500 dances, maintaining an active presence throughout the city.

He lost the 1907 election in part because his opponent, Republican George A. Hibbard, promised he would &quot;clean up [Fitzgerald&#x27;s] mess.&quot; With control of the city and state Government, Republicans revised the city charter to curb the power of the Irish Democratic ward bosses like Fitzgerald and Lomasney. They eliminated the large common council, replaced the board of aldermen with a nine-seat city council, extending the mayor&#x27;s term to four years, and making all offices formally non-partisan, removing the advantage of party recognition in the predominantly Democratic city.

=== Second term (1910–1914) ===
In 1910, Fitzgerald ran for mayor again. His campaign was almost scuttled by a bribery scandal involving no-bid contracts with kickbacks during his first term. Fitzgerald escaped prosecution, but made a long-term enemy in Daniel H. Coakley, an Irish lawyer who had defended one of the key figures in the business. In addition to his rivalry with Lomasney, Fitzgerald now also had to contend with the rising star of James Michael Curley of Roxbury, who was kept out of the race by assurances that Fitzgerald would serve only one term. Fitzgerald won a narrow victory over James J. Storrow, a stiff Protestant Republican Boston Brahmin.

Early in his first term as Boston&#x27;s mayor, Fitzgerald had formulated a plan to revitalize the commercial importance of the city under the banner of &quot;a Bigger, Busier and Better Boston.&quot; This plan was not pursued by Hibbard but gained traction after Fitzgerald&#x27;s return to office. Fitzgerald was able to persuade businesses and the Massachusetts legislature to invest $9 million for improvements to the port by 1912. Within a year, the investments began to pay off in the form of new port traffic to and from Europe.

In 1914, Fitzgerald broke his promise to Curley and attempted to run for a second consecutive term. Curley made common cause with Daniel Coakley, and they secured Fitzgerald&#x27;s withdrawal by threatening to expose a dalliance he had with a cigarette girl, Elizabeth &quot;Toodles&quot; Ryan—who was only 24, the same age as Fitzgerald&#x27;s daughter Rose—at a local gambling club. Curley was elected in January 1914 to his first of four terms as Boston mayor.

== Later political career ==
In 1916, Fitzgerald unsuccessfully challenged incumbent United States Senator Henry Cabot Lodge.

Fitzgerald won a close election for the House in 1918, but his opponent Peter F. Tague contested the race. Investigators found evidence of fraud in three precincts and when those precincts were eliminated they found Tague to be the winner. Fitzgerald served from March 4 until October 23, 1919, when the House voted unanimously that Fitzgerald had not won and that Tague had.

In 1922, Fitzgerald unsuccessfully challenged incumbent governor of Massachusetts Channing Cox.

Fitzgerald served on the Port of Boston Authority from 1934-1948 and in 1942 ran a quixotic campaign for the U.S. Senate. He lost the Democratic primary to Congressman Joseph E. Casey. (Daniel Coakley finished a distant fourth.)

== Retirement ==
In his later years, Fitzgerald focused on his business interests and on honing the political instincts of his daughter Rose&#x27;s promising sons.

In 1930, he ran for governor but withdrew late in the race for the Democratic nomination, citing his health. Despite his withdrawal, Fitzgerald received over 84,000 votes against eventual Governor Joseph B. Ely, as James Michael Curley encouraged Irish Catholic voters to support Fitzgerald in solidarity against the supposedly &quot;anti-Irish&quot; Ely.

In 1932, he campaigned for Franklin Delano Roosevelt for President. He was joined by James Michael Curley and P.J. Kennedy. Fitzgerald unsuccessfully tried to recruit Martin Lomasney to the cause as well. After Roosevelt won the election, Fitzgerald&#x27;s son-in-law Joseph was appointed chairman of the new U.S. Maritime Commission. Joseph would later serve as chairman of the new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and as U.S. ambassador to Great Britain.

In 1946, when John Fitzgerald &quot;Jack&quot; Kennedy decided to run for Congress, 83-year-old Honey Fitz helped him plan his campaign strategy. At the victory celebration, Fitzgerald danced an Irish jig, sang &quot;Sweet Adeline,&quot; and predicted that his grandson would someday occupy the White House. Shortly after his election to the presidency, President Kennedy renamed the presidential yacht the &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; in honor of his maternal grandfather.

==Personal life==
On September 18, 1889, Fitzgerald married his second cousin Mary Josephine &quot;Josie&quot; Hannon (1865–1964). She was a daughter of Michael Hannon and Mary Ann Fitzgerald. John and Mary had six children: Rose (1890–1995), Mary (1892–1936), Thomas (1895–1968), John Jr. (1897–1979), Eunice (1900–1923), and Frederick (1904–1935). They had nineteen grandchildren, including Rose&#x27;s nine children with Joseph Kennedy.

Fitzgerald was a member of the Royal Rooters, an early supporters&#x27; club for Boston&#x27;s baseball teams, particularly its American League team, the modern Boston Red Sox. At one point, he was the group&#x27;s chairman and threw out the ceremonial opening pitch at Fenway Park&#x27;s inaugural game on April 20, 1912, as well as in the 1912 World Series later that year. His great-granddaughter Caroline Kennedy threw out the first pitch at Fenway Park&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration on April 20, 2012.

== Death ==
On October 2, 1950, Fitzgerald died in Boston at the age of eighty-seven. His funeral was one of the largest in the city&#x27;s history. President Harry S. Truman sent his sympathies and Fitzgerald&#x27;s pallbearers included two U.S. Senators (Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and Leverett Saltonstall) two future U.S. Speakers of the House (John McCormack and Tip O&#x27;Neill), and James Michael Curley. As &quot;Honey Fitz&quot; was carried to his final rest from Holy Cross Cathedral to St. Joseph Cemetery in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, a crowd of thousands gathered along the streets and sang &quot;Sweet Adeline.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Of his stylish manner, Robert Dallek wrote: He was a natural politician—a charming, impish, affable lover of people. ... His warmth of character earned him yet another nickname, &quot;Honey Fitz,&quot; and he gained a reputation as the only politician who could sing &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot; sober and get away with it. A pixie-like character with florid face, bright eyes, and sandy hair, he was a showman who could have had a career in vaudeville. But politics, with all the brokering that went into arranging alliances and the hoopla that went into campaigning, was his calling. A verse of the day ran: &#x27;Honey Fitz can talk you blind / on any subject you can find / Fish and fishing, motor boats / Railroads, streetcars, getting votes.&#x27; His gift of gab became known as Fitzblarney, and his followers as &#x27;dearos,&#x27; a shortened version of his description of his district as &#x27;the dear old North End.&#x27;The official name for the Central Artery highway in Boston was &quot;The John F. Fitzgerald Expressway,&quot; until it was torn down in the 1990s as part of Boston&#x27;s &quot;Big Dig&quot; project which eliminated the Central Artery and replaced it with a tunnel. The resulting greenway above the tunnel where the expressway had been was named for Fitzgerald&#x27;s daughter as the &quot;Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway.&quot;

<text>&quot;Mind the gap&quot; or sometimes &quot;watch the gap&quot; is an audible or visual warning phrase issued to rail passengers to take caution while crossing the horizontal, and in some cases vertical, spatial gap between the train doorway and the station platform edge.

The phrase was first introduced in 1968 on the London Underground in the United Kingdom. It is popularly associated with the UK among tourists because of the particularly British word choice (this meaning of the verb &quot;mind&quot; has largely fallen into disuse in American English, where the term &quot;watch your step&quot; is more commonly used).

== Origin of the phrase ==

The phrase &quot;Mind the gap&quot; was coined in around 1968 for a planned automated announcement, after it had become impractical for drivers and station attendants to warn passengers. London Underground chose digital recording using solid state equipment with no moving parts. As data storage capacity was expensive, the phrase had to be short. A concise warning was also easier to paint onto the platform.

The equipment was supplied by AEG Telefunken. According to the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot;, sound engineer Peter Lodge, who owned Redan Recorders in Bayswater, working with a Scottish Telefunken engineer, recorded an actor reading &quot;Mind the gap&quot; and &quot;Stand clear of the doors please&quot;, but the actor insisted on royalties and the phrases had to be re-recorded. Lodge read the phrases to line up the recording equipment for level, and those were used.

While Lodge&#x27;s recording is still in use, some lines use other recordings. From 2005, the voice of Phil Sayer was heard on the Jubilee, Northern, and Piccadilly lines. When he died in 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, one of many newspapers worldwide to report his death, said, &quot;Mr. Sayer&#x27;s was not the only voice cautioning passengers to &#x27;mind the gap&#x27;, but it is arguably the most familiar one.&quot; For 15 years before that, the voice on the Piccadilly line was that of Archers actor Tim Bentinck, but is now Julie Berry&#x27;s. Another announcement was recorded by voice artist Emma Clarke. At least ten stations were supplied with announcers manufactured by PA Communications Ltd. of Milton Keynes. The recorded voice is that of Keith Wilson, their industrial sales manager (May 1990). It can still be heard at Paddington for example. Keith Wilson&#x27;s voice can be heard in the background of a scene in the Bond film &quot;Skyfall&quot;.

In March 2013, an old &quot;Mind the gap&quot; recording by Oswald Laurence was restored to the curved northbound platform at Embankment station on the Northern line&#x27;s Charing Cross branch so that the actor&#x27;s widow, Dr Margaret McCollum, could hear his voice.

== Use in Britain ==

=== London Underground ===
Because some platforms on the London Underground are curved, and the rolling stock that use them are straight, an unsafe gap is created when a train stops at a curved platform. In the absence of a device to fill the gap, some form of visual and auditory warning is needed to advise passengers of the risk of being caught unaware and sustaining injury by stepping into the gap. The phrase &quot;Mind the gap&quot; was chosen for this purpose and can be found painted along the edges of curved platforms and heard on recorded announcements when a train arrives at many Underground stations.

The recording is also used where platforms are non-standard height. Deep-level tube trains have a floor height around less than sub-surface stock trains. Where trains share platforms, for example, some Piccadilly line (deep-tube) and District line (sub-surface) stations, the platform is a compromise. On London&#x27;s Metropolitan line, a gap has been created between the train and the platform edge at Aldgate and Baker Street stations. This is due to the phasing out of the old &quot;A&quot; stock trains and their replacement with &quot;S&quot; stock trains, which have low floors to ease accessibility for disabled people.

&quot;Mind the gap&quot; audible warnings are always played on the Central line platforms at Bank, the Northern line northbound platform at Embankment, and the Bakerloo line platforms at Piccadilly Circus. The markings on the platform edge usually line up with the doors on the cars.

While the message is sometimes played over the platform&#x27;s public address system on some lines, usually it is an arrival message inside the train itself: &quot;Please mind the gap between the train and the platform&quot;.

During the coronation weekend of King Charles III in 2023, the message was voiced by the King himself and his wife Camilla. The King says, &quot;My wife and I wish you and your families a wonderful coronation weekend,&quot; followed by Camilla, who says, &quot;Wherever you are travelling, we hope you have a safe and pleasant journey,&quot; which is ended with the King saying &quot;And remember, please mind the gap.&quot; It was played throughout every railway station in the United Kingdom.

== Use in Ireland ==
The phrase &quot;mind the gap&quot; can be heard at each station along Dublin&#x27;s DART and at all stations in the city centre. The message can be seen in some train stations in the rest of Ireland. On Commuter and InterCity trains, the phrase &quot;Please mind the gap&quot; is accompanied by the Irish &quot;&quot; when pulling into stations.

== The phrase worldwide ==

=== In trains ===


Equivalents of &quot;Mind the gap&quot; are used by transit systems worldwide, particularly when stations curve, but most new systems tend to avoid these types of stations.

==== Europe ====
* The French version &quot;&quot; (&quot;Watch your step when getting off the train&quot;), an , can be heard on trains arriving at curved stations on Metro lines 1 to 7, 9, 11, 13, 14 and RER A, B, E. Announcements are also played in English (&quot;Please mind the gap between the train and the platform&quot;) and in either Italian, German, Japanese, Spanish, or Korean. Written signage can be seen when walking up to said platforms. Another version used by SNCF is &quot;&quot; (&quot;Be careful with the gap between the footboard and the platform.&quot;) on national rail services.
* In the Athens Metro, the message &quot;&quot; (&quot;Please mind the gap between the train and the platform&quot;) is heard in both Greek and English at the stations of Monastiraki and Agios Nikolaos.
* In Stockholm&#x27;s tunnelbana and on Stockholm commuter rail&#x27;s stations two versions can be heard: &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Mind the distance between carriage and platform when you exit&quot;. It is also displayed as text on electronic displays.
* In Oslo, T-bane trains play a recorded Norwegian warning: &quot;&quot; (Be aware of the distance between train and platform.) -- followed up by the English &quot;Please mind the gap.&quot;
* In Helsinki, on some commuter rail stations, &quot;Mind the gap&quot; can be heard in English, Finnish, and Swedish.
* In Hamburg, passengers at the S-Bahn station Berliner Tor are warned with yellow flashing lights and the announcement &quot;&quot; (&quot;Please mind the gap between train and platform&quot;).
* On the Berlin U-Bahn, the phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;Please mind the gap between train and platform edge when alighting&quot;) is used, followed by the English &quot;Please mind the gap between platform and train.&quot;
* On the Madrid Metro, a recorded warning message can be heard inside the trains when approaching a station with curved platforms: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Caution: station on a curve. As you exit, be careful not to place your foot between the train and the platform.&quot;) No warning messages are heard when arriving at a station with straight platforms.
* On the Lisbon Metro at the Marquês de Pombal station on the blue line, the announcement &quot;&quot; (&quot;Pay attention to the gap between the platform and the train&quot;) can be heard.
* On all of the trains of the Milan Metro network, a yellow sticker on every door is visible with the warning in the Italian language &quot;&quot; (meaning literally &quot;Pay attention to the gap between the train and the platform&quot;) and also in English &quot;Mind the gap between the train and the platform&quot;.
*On the Amsterdam Metro, a female voice announces the phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;Pay attention to the space between the metro and platform during boarding and disembarking.&quot;) when approaching some stations, which is then followed in English by: &quot;Please mind the gap between the train and platform.&quot;
*Trains of the Dutch Railways have an announcement that warns passengers to carefully disembark because of high-level difference: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Dear passengers, pay attention when disembarking. There is a level difference between the platform and the train.&quot;) This is only announced in Dutch.
*In Warsaw Metro, a sticker over the doors depicting a stick figure falling into the gap with texts below: &quot;&quot; in Polish and (in italics) &quot;Mind the gap&quot; in (British) English, both written in Frutiger font (the same as all assets forming Warsaw Public Transport).

==== Asia ====
* On Jakarta&#x27;s Commuterline (KRL), the train announcement &quot;Perhatikan jarak antara peron dengan kereta.&quot; is spoken. This translates as &quot;Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.&quot; An English announcement is then played: &quot;Please mind the platform gap.&quot; 
* On Singapore&#x27;s MRT, the phrases &quot;Please mind the platform gap&quot; and &quot;Please mind the gap&quot; are used in announcements in English, played in the trains whenever a train approaches an underground station after the station&#x27;s name has been announced twice. It is played on underground station platforms just after the train doors open or, sometimes, just as the train approaches the platform. Trains also have stickers pasted on the windows to caution passengers. The Chinese version &quot;请小心空隙&quot; is also commonly heard.
* The phrase can be heard in New Delhi Metro in two languages (English and Hindi): &quot;&quot; &quot;Mind the gap&quot;.
*It also can be heard in Chennai Metro in two languages (English and Tamil): &quot;&quot; &quot;Please Mind the gap&quot;. 
* On Hong Kong&#x27;s MTR, the phrase &quot;Please mind the gap&quot; () is announced in three languages: Cantonese, Mandarin, and English. In recent years, a more elaborate version of the announcement, heard on some East Rail line stations with very curved platforms, says, &quot;Please mind the gap and be aware of the difference in levels between the platform and the train&quot; ().
* Several mainland Chinese metro systems use the phrase extensively; on the Tianjin Metro, announcements and stickers on train doors and platforms mention the gap (as well as to &quot;mind the gap&quot;) in both English and Chinese. (The Chinese phrase is .) The Beijing Subway uses &quot;Mind the Gaps&quot; (note the plural). On lines operated by Beijing MTR Corp., Ltd., the Hong Kong/British influence is prominent, with the English announcement &quot;Please mind the gap between the train and the platform&quot; – having a British pronunciation – being played every time a train arrives. Both the Shanghai Metro and the Nanjing Metro use versions with slightly mutilated grammar (&quot;Caution, Gap&quot; and &quot;Care the Gap&quot;, respectively, although the Chinese is the same).
* On the Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3, a pre-recorded message is played at certain stations reminding passengers to &quot;Watch your step and watch the gap between the train and the platform as you get on and off the train&quot;. This is simplified in its Filipino translation, which reminds passengers to be careful when boarding and alighting the train.
* When approaching Taipei Main Station and Guandu Station on the Red line of Taipei Metro, after the transfer information is announced, the phrase &quot;Mind the gap&quot; () is announced in Mandarin, English, Hokkien and Hakka.
* On many trains in Japan, the message &quot;&quot; is spoken. This translates as: &quot;There is a wide space between the train and the platform, so please be careful&quot;. The phrase &quot;&quot; is also common, which means &quot;Please mind your step&quot;.
* In Thailand, the announcement is used somewhat differently from the London one. On Bangkok underground trains and Airport Rail Link trains, it says, &quot;Please mind the gap between train and platform&quot;. Some grammarians argue that as specific and countable nouns, the words &quot;train&quot; and &quot;platform&quot; should be preceded by &quot;the&quot;. Also, the Thai language version of the announcement does not refer to a &quot;gap&quot; but translates to &quot;Please be careful when stepping out of the train&quot;, and is announced at every station as &quot;&quot; (romanised: ). However, in the Bangkok skytrain stations, the Thai announcement mentions the &quot;gap&quot;, and is announced quite infrequently as: &quot;&quot; (romanised: ) and can be translated into: &quot;Attention, passengers, while entering and exiting the train, please mind the gap between the platform and the train. Thank you.&quot;
* Signs on ferry docks in Shanghai render the phrase in Chinglish as &quot;Note that the level of gap&quot;.
* Announcements are made on Seoul Metro trains when arriving at stations with a curved platform, e.g. Myeongdong station on Line 4 and Singil station on Line 1, saying &quot;&quot; (which translates as &quot;There is a big gap between the station platform and the train, please be careful when getting off&quot;) and &quot;Please watch your step&quot; in Korean and English.
* The phrase is used in Dhaka Metro&#x27;s pre-recorded audio announcement in a female voice after stopping at the stations in both Bangla and English. In English, the phrase goes, &quot;Please mind the gap&quot;. In Bangla, however, the audio announcement does not explicitly mention or announce the gap; therefore, the phrase goes as &quot;&quot; (romanised: ) meaning &quot;Please maintain a safe distance&quot;.

==== Oceania ====

* At most Sydney Trains stations and on Waratah series train carriages, there is an automated announcement reminding passengers to mind the gap (&quot;Please mind the gap when getting on or off the train&quot;) as well as posters informing riders about the number of people who fall down the gap each year.
* Adelaide Metro trains conclude automated station announcements with the reminder, &quot;Please mind the gap&quot;.
* Many Queensland Rail trains announce &quot;mind the gap&quot; after the station name on arrival at a station.
* On Transperth trains arriving at Perth, Mount Lawley, Sherwood and Stirling the announcement &quot;Please mind the gap&quot; is used.

==== Americas ====

* In early 2009 the phrase was also being used on Metro Transit (King County) buses in and around Seattle, Washington.
* At the stations of the São Paulo Metro and CPTM in São Paulo, Brazil, the sentence that can be heard is &quot;&quot; (&quot;Watch the gap between the train and the platform&quot;).
* At almost all stations of SuperVia, Rio de Janeiro suburban trains, the driver announces &quot;Observe o espaço entre o trem e a plataforma&quot; (&quot;Watch the space between the train and the platform&quot;), and sometimes &quot;Observe o desnível entre o trem e a plataforma&quot; (&quot;Watch the level difference between the train and the platform&quot;).
* On the Rio de Janeiro Metro, the phrase &quot;&quot;Observe atentamente o espaço entre o trem e a plataforma&quot; – Mind the gap&quot; also can be heard.
* During the CPTM train trips in São Paulo, the announcer says, before reaching a station, &quot;&quot;Ao desembarcar, cuidado com o vão entre o trem e a plataforma&quot; – Before leaving, mind the gap between the train and the platform&quot;.

* The New York City–area Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North, and New Jersey Transit use signs that read &quot;Watch the gap&quot; on trains and platforms. Because of reports of people falling through the gap, a warning is now played at every station, plus automated announcements on board the trains of all three railroads.
** The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which operates LIRR and MNRR, retained New York personalities, including Maria Bartiromo and Al Roker, to recite the slogan. The newer trains with automated announcements also announce, &quot;As you leave the train, please watch/step over the gap between the train and platform&quot;, to warn passengers to use caution.
** It is also used on the MTA-operated New York City Subway and the Staten Island Railway – on trains and platforms and in conductor announcements. Newer trains equipped with automated announcements would say, &quot;As you exit, please be careful of the gap between the platform and the train&quot;, where applicable after a station announcement is made.
** New Jersey Transit uses signs on doors on all trains that read &quot;Caution: Watch the gap&quot; and an announcement plays &quot;When leaving the train, please watch the gap&quot; where applicable to warn passengers to remain cautious of the gap.
* Plaques on Toronto subway station platforms warn riders to &quot;Mind the gap.&quot; Platform-edge decals warn passengers, &#x27;Wide gap space, mind the gap when entering.&#x27; Similar warnings are affixed to the inside of carriage doors. These warnings are featured alongside a ubiquitous graphic depicting a passenger boarding a carriage. Announcements about the warning on the public announcement system in each station can also be heard intermittently.
* In the United States, the standard Amtrak conductor announcement when approaching any station stop concludes with &quot;Mind the gap between the train and the platform&quot;. This is not strictly adhered to, and the more common American phraseology &#x27;Watch the gap&#x27; may be heard instead.
* On the Buenos Aires Metro, warnings on platform floors and on the door windows in the trains read &quot;Cuidado con el espacio entre el tren y el andén.&quot; (&quot;Mind the gap between train and platform&quot;).
* The MBTA in Boston has added &quot;Mind the gap&quot; warnings near the platform edges in the 2016 renovated Government Center Station.

=== Other uses ===

Despite its origin as a utilitarian safety warning, &quot;Mind the gap&quot; has become a stock phrase and is used in many other contexts having little to do with subway safety.

It has been used as the title of at least two music albums by Scooter and Tristan Psionic, a film, and a novel, as the name of a movie production company, a theatre company, and a board game. It was also the title of a regional daytime quiz show on ITV, hosted by Paul Ross.

The phrase is used in many video games, including &quot;Portal&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3&quot;, &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;Where&#x27;s My Water&quot;, &quot;Temple Run&quot;, &quot;Quantum Conundrum&quot;, &quot;Killing Floor&quot;, &quot;Amazing Alex&quot;, &quot;Armadillo Run&quot; and &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;, and in animated series such as &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, usually in an ironic context. A soldier in &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot; says it humorously before they descend via zip-line onto a moving train across snowy mountain peaks. It was a prominent utterance by the subterranean cannibal killer of the 1972 movie &quot;Death Line&quot;. The phrase is also featured in the soundtrack of the game &quot;Timesplitters: Future Perfect&quot; in the Subway level.

It is also the title of a Noisettes song on their album &quot;What&#x27;s the Time Mr. Wolf?&quot;. The phrase is used in the songs &quot;Deadwing&quot; by Porcupine Tree, &quot;Bingo&quot; by Madness, &quot;Someone in London&quot; by Godsmack, Metal Airplanes by Matthew Good and &quot;New Frontier&quot; by the Counting Crows. Emma Clarke, one of the voices of the London Underground, has released a Mind The Gap single. It features spoof London Underground announcements. The name of the Portuguese hip hop group Mind Da Gap was also inspired by this stock phrase.

The phrase was used as the name for a campaign in December 2010 to lobby the UK Government to allow Gap Year students to defer their university place and not pay the higher tuition fees in September 2012.

The phrase has been used to name a combinatorial optimization problem.

The original Oswald Laurence &quot;Mind the gap&quot; announcement and the current voice-over announcements are also used in electronic music.

<text>The Battle of Berlin, designated as the Berlin Strategic Offensive Operation by the Soviet Union, and also known as the Fall of Berlin, was one of the last major offensives of the European theatre of World War II.

After the Vistula–Oder offensive of January–February 1945, the Red Army had temporarily halted on a line east of Berlin. On 9 March, Germany established its defence plan for the city with Operation Clausewitz. The first defensive preparations at the outskirts of Berlin were made on 20 March, under the newly appointed commander of Army Group Vistula, General Gotthard Heinrici.

When the Soviet offensive resumed on 16 April, two Soviet fronts (army groups) attacked Berlin from the east and south, while a third overran German forces positioned north of Berlin. Before the main battle in Berlin commenced, the Red Army encircled the city after successful battles of the Seelow Heights and Halbe. On 20 April 1945, Hitler&#x27;s birthday, the 1st Belorussian Front led by Marshal Georgy Zhukov, advancing from the east and north, started shelling Berlin&#x27;s city centre, while Marshal Ivan Konev&#x27;s 1st Ukrainian Front broke through Army Group Centre and advanced towards the southern suburbs of Berlin. On 23 April General Helmuth Weidling assumed command of the forces within Berlin. The garrison consisted of several depleted and disorganised Army and Waffen-SS divisions, along with poorly trained &quot;Volkssturm&quot; and Hitler Youth members. Over the course of the next week, the Red Army gradually took the entire city.

On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide. The city&#x27;s garrison surrendered on 2 May but fighting continued to the north-west, west, and south-west of the city until the end of the war in Europe on 8 May (9 May in the Soviet Union) as some German units fought westward so that they could surrender to the Western Allies rather than to the Soviets.

==Background==
On 12 January 1945, the Red Army began the Vistula–Oder Offensive across the Narew River and from Warsaw, a three-day operation on a broad front, which incorporated four army Fronts. On the fourth day, the Red Army broke out and started moving west, up to per day, taking East Prussia, Danzig, and Poznań, drawing up on a line east of Berlin along the Oder River.

The new Army Group Vistula ( Heinrich Himmler), conducted Operation Solstice, a counter-attack, but this had failed by 24 February. The Red Army then drove on to Pomerania, clearing the right bank of the Oder River, thereby reaching into Silesia.

In the south, Soviet and Romanian forces conducted the Siege of Budapest. Three German divisions&#x27; attempts to relieve the city city failed, and Budapest fell to the Soviets on 13 February. Adolf Hitler insisted on a counter-attack to recapture the Drau-Danube triangle. The goal was to secure the oil region of Nagykanizsa and regain the Danube River for future operations but the depleted German forces had been given an impossible task. By 16 March, the German Operation Spring Awakening (also the Lake Balaton Offensive) had failed, and a counter-attack by the Red Army took back in 24 hours everything the Germans had taken ten days to gain. On 30 March, the Soviets entered Austria; and in the Vienna Offensive they captured Vienna on 13 April.

On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had happened once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).

No plans were made by the Western Allies to seize the city. The Supreme Commander [Western] Allied Expeditionary Force, General Eisenhower, lost interest in the race to Berlin and saw no further need to suffer casualties by attacking a city that would be in the Soviet sphere of influence after the war, envisioning excessive friendly fire if both armies attempted to occupy the city at once. The main Western Allied contribution to the battle was the bombing of Berlin during 1945. During 1945 the United States Army Air Forces launched mass day raids on Berlin and for 36 nights in succession, scores of Royal Air Force (RAF) Mosquitos bombed the German capital, ending on the night of 20/21 April 1945 just before the Soviets entered the city.

==Preparations==
The Soviet offensive into central Germany, what later became East Germany, had two objectives. Stalin did not believe the Western Allies would hand over territory occupied by them in the post-war Soviet zone, so he began the offensive on a broad front and moved rapidly to meet the Western Allies as far west as possible. But the overriding objective was to capture Berlin. The two goals were complementary because possession of the zone could not be won quickly unless Berlin was taken. Another consideration was that Berlin itself held useful post-war strategic assets, including Adolf Hitler and the German nuclear weapons program (but unknown to the Soviet Union, by the time of the Battle of Berlin, the bulk of the uranium and most of the scientists had been evacuated to Haigerloch in the Black Forest). On 6 March, Hitler appointed Lieutenant General Helmuth Reymann commander of the Berlin Defence Area, replacing Lieutenant General Bruno Ritter von Hauenschild.

On 20 March, General Gotthard Heinrici was appointed Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula replacing Himmler. Heinrici was one of the best defensive tacticians in the German army, and he immediately started to lay defensive plans. Heinrici correctly assessed that the main Soviet thrust would be made over the Oder River and along the main east-west Autobahn. He decided not to try to defend the banks of the Oder with anything more than a light skirmishing screen. Instead, Heinrici arranged for engineers to fortify the Seelow Heights, which overlooked the Oder River at the point where the Autobahn crossed them. This was some west of the Oder and east of Berlin. Heinrici thinned out the line in other areas to increase the manpower available to defend the heights. German engineers turned the Oder&#x27;s flood plain, already saturated by the spring thaw, into a swamp by releasing the water from a reservoir upstream. Behind the plain on the plateau, the engineers built three belts of defensive emplacements reaching back towards the outskirts of Berlin (the lines nearer to Berlin were called the &quot;Wotan&quot; position). These lines consisted of anti-tank ditches, anti-tank gun emplacements, and an extensive network of trenches and bunkers.

On 9 April, after a long resistance, Königsberg in East Prussia fell to the Red Army. This freed up Marshal Rokossovsky&#x27;s 2nd Belorussian Front to move west to the east bank of the Oder river. Marshal Georgy Zhukov concentrated his 1st Belorussian Front, which had been deployed along the Oder river from Frankfurt (Oder) in the south to the Baltic, into an area in front of the Seelow Heights. The 2nd Belorussian Front moved into the positions being vacated by the 1st Belorussian Front north of the Seelow Heights. While this redeployment was in progress, gaps were left in the lines; and the remnants of General Dietrich von Saucken&#x27;s German II Army, which had been bottled up in a pocket near Danzig, managed to escape into the Vistula delta. To the south, Marshal Konev shifted the main weight of the 1st Ukrainian Front out of Upper Silesia and north-west to the Neisse River.

The three Soviet fronts had altogether 2.5 million men (including 78,556 soldiers of the 1st Polish Army), 6,250 tanks, 7,500 aircraft, 41,600 artillery pieces and mortars, 3,255 truck-mounted Katyusha rocket launchers (nicknamed &#x27;Stalin&#x27;s Organ&#x27;), and 95,383 motor vehicles, many manufactured in the US.

==Battle of the Oder–Neisse==


The sector in which most of the fighting in the overall offensive took place was the Seelow Heights, the last major defensive line outside Berlin. The Battle of the Seelow Heights, fought over four days from 16 until 19 April, was one of the last pitched battles of World War II: almost one million Red Army soldiers and more than 20,000 tanks and artillery pieces were deployed to break through the &quot;Gates to Berlin&quot;, which were defended by about 100,000 German soldiers and 1,200 tanks and guns. The Soviet forces led by Zhukov broke through the defensive positions, having suffered about 30,000 dead, while 12,000 German personnel were killed.

On 19 April, the fourth day, the 1st Belorussian Front broke through the final line of the Seelow Heights and nothing but broken German formations lay between them and Berlin. The 1st Ukrainian Front, having captured Forst the day before, fanned out into open country. One powerful thrust by Gordov&#x27;s 3rd Guards Army and Rybalko&#x27;s 3rd and Lelyushenko&#x27;s 4th Guards Tank Armies were heading north-east towards Berlin while other armies headed west towards a section of the United States Army&#x27;s front line south-west of Berlin on the Elbe. With these advances, the Soviet forces drove a wedge between Army Group Vistula in the north and Army Group Centre in the south. By the end of the day, the German eastern front line north of Frankfurt around Seelow and to the south around Forst had ceased to exist. These breakthroughs allowed the two Soviet Fronts to envelop the German 9th Army in a large pocket west of Frankfurt. Attempts by the 9th Army to break out to the west resulted in the Battle of Halbe. The cost to the Soviet forces had been very high, with over 2,807 tanks lost between 1 and 19 April, including at least 727 at the Seelow Heights.

In the meantime, RAF Mosquitos conducted tactical air raids against German positions inside Berlin on the nights of 15 April (105 bombers), 17 April (61 bombers), 18 April (57 bombers), 19 April (79 bombers), and 20 April (78 bombers).

==Encirclement of Berlin==
On 20 April 1945, Hitler&#x27;s 56th birthday, Soviet artillery of the 1st Belorussian Front began shelling Berlin and did not stop until the city surrendered. The weight of ordnance delivered by Soviet artillery during the battle was greater than the total tonnage dropped by Western Allied bombers on the city. While the 1st Belorussian Front advanced towards the east and north-east of the city, the 1st Ukrainian Front pushed through the last formations of the northern wing of Army Group Centre and passed north of Juterbog, well over halfway to the American front line on the river Elbe at Magdeburg. To the north between Stettin and Schwedt, the 2nd Belorussian Front attacked the northern flank of Army Group Vistula, held by Hasso von Manteuffel&#x27;s III Panzer Army. The next day, Bogdanov&#x27;s 2nd Guards Tank Army advanced nearly north of Berlin and then attacked south-west of Werneuchen. The Soviet plan was to encircle Berlin first and then envelop the IX Army.
The command of the German V Corps, trapped with the IX Army north of Forst, passed from the IV Panzer Army to the IX Army. The corps was still holding on to the Berlin-Cottbus highway front line. Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner&#x27;s Army Group Centre launched a counter-offensive aimed at breaking through to Berlin from the south and entering (the Battle of Bautzen) in the 1st Ukrainian Front region, engaging the 2nd Polish Army and elements of the Red Army&#x27;s 52nd Army and 5th Guards Army. When the old southern flank of the IV Panzer Army had some local successes counter-attacking north against the 1st Ukrainian Front, Hitler unrealistically ordered the IX Army to hold Cottbus and set up a front facing west. Next, they were to attack the Soviet columns advancing north to form a pincer that would meet the IV Panzer Army coming from the south and envelop the 1st Ukrainian Front before destroying it. They were to anticipate a southward attack by the III Panzer Army and be ready to be the southern arm of a pincer attack that would envelop 1st Belorussian Front, which would be destroyed by SS-General Felix Steiner&#x27;s Army Detachment advancing from north of Berlin. Later in the day, when Steiner explained that he did not have the divisions to achieve this, Heinrici made it clear to Hitler&#x27;s staff that unless the IX Army retreated immediately, it would be enveloped by the Soviets. He stressed that it was already too late for it to move north-west to Berlin and would have to retreat west. Heinrici went on to say that if Hitler did not allow it to move west, he would ask to be relieved of his command.

On 22 April 1945, at his afternoon situation conference, Hitler fell into a tearful rage when he realised that his plans, prepared the previous day, could not be achieved. He declared that the war was lost, blaming the generals for the defeat and that he would remain in Berlin until the end and then kill himself.

In an attempt to coax Hitler out of his rage, General Alfred Jodl speculated that General Walther Wenck&#x27;s XII Army, which was facing the Americans, could move to Berlin because the Americans, already on the Elbe River, were unlikely to move further east. This assumption was based on his viewing of the captured Eclipse documents, which organised the partition of Germany among the Allies. Hitler immediately grasped the idea, and within hours Wenck was ordered to disengage from the Americans and move the XII Army north-east to support Berlin. It was then realised that if the IX Army moved west, it could link up with the XII Army. In the evening Heinrici was given permission to make the link-up.

Elsewhere, the 2nd Belorussian Front had established a bridgehead deep on the west bank of the Oder and was heavily engaged with the III Panzer Army. The IX Army had lost Cottbus and was being pressed from the east. A Soviet tank spearhead was on the Havel River to the east of Berlin, and another had at one point penetrated the inner defensive ring of Berlin.

The capital was now within range of field artillery. A Soviet war correspondent, in the style of World War II Soviet journalism, gave the following account of an important event which took place on 22 April 1945 at 08:30 local time:
On 23 April 1945, the Soviet 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front continued to tighten the encirclement, severing the last link between the German IX Army and the city. Elements of the 1st Ukrainian Front continued to move westward and started to engage the German XII Army moving towards Berlin. On this same day, Hitler appointed General Helmuth Weidling as the commander of the Berlin Defence Area, replacing Lieutenant General Reymann. Meanwhile, by 24 April 1945 elements of 1st Belorussian Front and 1st Ukrainian Front had completed the encirclement of the city. Within the next day, 25 April 1945, the Soviet investment of Berlin was consolidated, with leading Soviet units probing and penetrating the S-Bahn defensive ring. By the end of the day, it was clear that the German defence of the city could not do anything but temporarily delay the capture of the city by the Soviets, since the decisive stages of the battle had already been fought and lost by the Germans outside the city. By that time, Schörner&#x27;s offensive, initially successful, had mostly been thwarted, although he did manage to inflict significant casualties on the opposing Polish and Soviet units, slowing down their progress.

==Battle in Berlin==
The forces available to General Weidling for the city&#x27;s defence included roughly 45,000 soldiers in several severely depleted &quot;Heer&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; divisions. These divisions were supplemented by the Berlin Police force, boys in the compulsory &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot;, and the &quot;Volkssturm&quot;. Many of the 40,000 elderly men of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; had been in the army as young men and some were veterans of World War I. Hitler appointed &quot;SS Brigadeführer&quot; Wilhelm Mohnke the Battle Commander for the central government district that included the Reich Chancellery and &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. He had over 2,000 men under his command. Weidling organised the defences into eight sectors designated &#x27;A&#x27; through to &#x27;H&#x27; each one commanded by a colonel or a general, but most had no combat experience. To the west of the city was the 20th Infantry Division. To the north of the city was the 9th Parachute Division. To the north-east of the city was the Panzer Division &quot;Müncheberg&quot;. To the south-east of the city and to the east of Tempelhof Airport was the 11th SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Nordland&quot;. The reserve, 18th Panzergrenadier Division, was in Berlin&#x27;s central district.

On 23 April, Berzarin&#x27;s 5th Shock Army and Katukov&#x27;s 1st Guards Tank Army assaulted Berlin from the south-east and, after overcoming a counter-attack by the German LVI Panzer Corps, reached the Berlin S-Bahn ring railway on the north side of the Teltow Canal by the evening of 24 April. During the same period, of all the German forces ordered to reinforce the inner defences of the city by Hitler, only a small contingent of French SS volunteers under the command of &quot;SS Brigadeführer&quot; Gustav Krukenberg arrived in Berlin. During 25 April, Krukenberg was appointed as the commander of Defence Sector C, the sector under the most pressure from the Soviet assault on the city.

On 26 April, Chuikov&#x27;s 8th Guards Army and the 1st Guards Tank Army fought their way through the southern suburbs and attacked Tempelhof Airport, just inside the S-Bahn defensive ring, where they met stiff resistance from the &quot;Müncheberg&quot; Division. But by 27 April, the two understrength divisions (&quot;Müncheberg&quot; and &quot;Nordland&quot;) that were defending the south-east, now facing five Soviet armies—from east to west, the 5th Shock Army, the 8th Guards Army, the 1st Guards Tank Army and Rybalko&#x27;s 3rd Guards Tank Army (part of the 1st Ukrainian Front)—were forced back towards the centre, taking up new defensive positions around Hermannplatz. Krukenberg informed General Hans Krebs, Chief of the General Staff of Army high command that within 24 hours the &quot;Nordland&quot; would have to fall back to the centre sector Z (for &quot;Zentrum&quot;). The Soviet advance to the city centre was along these main axes: from the south-east, along the Frankfurter Allee (ending and stopped at the Alexanderplatz); from the south along Sonnenallee ending north of the Belle-Alliance-Platz, from the south ending near the Potsdamer Platz and from the north ending near the Reichstag. The Reichstag, the Moltke bridge, Alexanderplatz, and the Havel bridges at Spandau saw the heaviest fighting, with house-to-house and hand-to-hand combat. The foreign contingents of the SS fought particularly hard, because they were ideologically motivated and they believed that they would not live if captured.

===Battle for the Reichstag===

In the early hours of 29 April the Soviet 3rd Shock Army crossed the Moltke Bridge and started to fan out into the surrounding streets and buildings. The initial assaults on buildings, including the Ministry of the Interior, were hampered by the lack of supporting artillery. It was not until the damaged bridges were repaired that artillery could be moved up in support. At 04:00 hours, in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;, Hitler signed his last will and testament and, shortly afterwards, married Eva Braun. At dawn the Soviets pressed on with their assault in the south-east. After very heavy fighting they managed to capture Gestapo headquarters on Prinz-Albrechtstrasse, but a Waffen-SS counter-attack forced the Soviets to withdraw from the building. To the south-west the 8th Guards Army attacked north across the Landwehr canal into the Tiergarten.

By the next day, 30 April, the Soviets had solved their bridging problems and with artillery support at 06:00 they launched an attack on the Reichstag, but because of German entrenchments and support from 12.8 cm FlaK 40 guns away on the roof of the Zoo flak tower, close by Berlin Zoo, it was not until that evening that the Soviets were able to enter the building. The Reichstag had not been in use since it had burned in February 1933 and its interior resembled a rubble heap more than a government building. The German troops inside were heavily entrenched, and fierce room-to-room fighting ensued. At that point there was still a large contingent of German soldiers in the basement who launched counter-attacks against the Red Army. By 2 May 1945 the Red Army controlled the building entirely. The famous photo of the two soldiers planting the flag on the roof of the building is a re-enactment photo taken the day after the building was taken. To the Soviets the event as represented by the photo became symbolic of their victory demonstrating that the Battle of Berlin, as well as the Eastern Front hostilities as a whole, ended with the total Soviet victory. As the 756th Regiment&#x27;s commander Zinchenko had stated in his order to Battalion Commander Neustroev &quot;... the Supreme High Command ... and the entire Soviet People order you to erect the victory banner on the roof above Berlin&quot;.

===Battle for the centre===
During the early hours of 30 April, Weidling informed Hitler in person that the defenders would probably exhaust their ammunition during the night. Hitler granted him permission to attempt a breakout through the encircling Red Army lines. That afternoon, Hitler and Braun committed suicide and their bodies were cremated not far from the bunker. In accordance with Hitler&#x27;s last will and testament, Admiral Karl Dönitz became the &quot;President of the Reich&quot; (&quot;Reichspräsident&quot;) and Joseph Goebbels became the new Chancellor of the Reich (&quot;Reichskanzler&quot;).

As the perimeter shrank and the surviving defenders fell back, they became concentrated into a small area in the city centre. By now there were about 10,000 German soldiers in the city centre, which was being assaulted from all sides. One of the other main thrusts was along Wilhelmstrasse on which the Air Ministry, built of reinforced concrete, was pounded by large concentrations of Soviet artillery. The remaining German Tiger tanks of the Hermann von Salza battalion took up positions in the east of the Tiergarten to defend the centre against Kuznetsov&#x27;s 3rd Shock Army (which although heavily engaged around the Reichstag was also flanking the area by advancing through the northern Tiergarten) and the 8th Guards Army advancing through the south of the Tiergarten. These Soviet forces had effectively cut the sausage-shaped area held by the Germans in half and made any escape attempt to the west for German troops in the centre much more difficult.

During the early hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, informing him of Hitler&#x27;s death and a willingness to negotiate a citywide surrender. They could not agree on terms because of Soviet insistence on unconditional surrender and Krebs&#x27; claim that he lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels&#x27;s death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness.

===Breakout and surrender===
On the night of 1/2 May, most of the remnants of the Berlin garrison attempted to break out of the city centre via three directions. Only those that went west through the Tiergarten and crossed the Charlottenbrücke (a bridge over the Havel) into Spandau succeeded in breaching Soviet lines. A handful of those who survived the initial breakout made it to the lines of the Western Allies—most were either killed or captured by the Red Army&#x27;s outer encirclement forces west of the city. Early in the morning of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 06:00 hours. He was taken to see General Vasily Chuikov at 08:23, where Weidling ordered the city&#x27;s defenders to surrender to the Soviets. The 350-strong garrison of the Zoo flak tower left the building. There was sporadic fighting in a few isolated buildings where some SS troops still refused to surrender, but the Soviets reduced such buildings to rubble.

===Hitler&#x27;s Nero Decree===
The city&#x27;s food supplies had been largely destroyed on Hitler&#x27;s orders. 128 of the 226 bridges had been blown up and 87 pumps rendered inoperative. &quot;A quarter of the subway stations were under water, flooded on Hitler&#x27;s orders. Thousands and thousands who had sought shelter in them had drowned when the SS had carried out the blowing up of the protective devices on the Landwehr Canal.&quot; A number of workers, on their own initiative, resisted or sabotaged the SS&#x27;s plan to destroy the city&#x27;s infrastructure; they successfully prevented the blowing up of the Klingenberg power station, the Johannisthal waterworks, and other pumping stations, railroad facilities, and bridges.

==Battle outside Berlin==
At some point on 28 April or 29 April, General Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, was relieved of his command after disobeying Hitler&#x27;s direct orders to hold Berlin at all costs and never order a retreat, and was replaced by General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici&#x27;s interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. There remains some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula&#x27;s coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few days of the war was of little significance.

On the evening of 29 April, Krebs contacted General Alfred Jodl (Supreme Army Command) by radio: 

In the early morning of 30 April, Jodl replied to Krebs: 

===North===
While the 1st Belorussian Front and the 1st Ukrainian Front encircled Berlin, and started the battle for the city itself, Rokossovsky&#x27;s 2nd Belorussian Front started his offensive to the north of Berlin. On 20 April between Stettin and Schwedt, Rokossovsky&#x27;s 2nd Belorussian Front attacked the northern flank of Army Group Vistula, held by the III Panzer Army. By 22 April, the 2nd Belorussian Front had established a bridgehead on the east bank of the Oder that was over deep and was heavily engaged with the III Panzer Army. On 25 April, the 2nd Belorussian Front broke through III Panzer Army&#x27;s line around the bridgehead south of Stettin, crossed the &quot;Randowbruch&quot; Swamp, and were now free to move west towards Montgomery&#x27;s British 21st Army Group and north towards the Baltic port of Stralsund.

The German III Panzer Army and the German XXI Army situated to the north of Berlin retreated westwards under relentless pressure from Rokossovsky&#x27;s 2nd Belorussian Front, and was eventually pushed into a pocket wide that stretched from the Elbe to the coast. To their west was the British 21st Army Group (which on 1 May broke out of its Elbe bridgehead and had raced to the coast capturing Wismar and Lübeck), to their east Rokossovsky&#x27;s 2nd Belorussian Front and to the south was the United States Ninth Army which had penetrated as far east as Ludwigslust and Schwerin.

===South===

The successes of the 1st Ukrainian Front during the first nine days of the battle meant that by 25 April, they were occupying large swathes of the area south and south-west of Berlin. Their spearheads had met elements of the 1st Belorussian Front west of Berlin, completing the investment of the city. Meanwhile, the 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army in 1st Ukrainian Front made contact with the 69th Infantry Division (United States) of the United States First Army near Torgau, on the Elbe River. These manoeuvres had broken the German forces south of Berlin into three parts. The German IX Army was surrounded in the Halbe pocket. Wenck&#x27;s XII Army, obeying Hitler&#x27;s command of 22 April, was attempting to force its way into Berlin from the south-west but met stiff resistance from 1st Ukrainian Front around Potsdam. Schörner&#x27;s Army Group Centre was forced to withdraw from the Battle of Berlin, along its lines of communications towards Czechoslovakia.

Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army fought a desperate action to break out of the pocket in an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a successful breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no evidence to suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler&#x27;s agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.

At dawn on 28 April, the youth divisions &quot;Clausewitz&quot;, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;, and &quot;Theodor Körner&quot; attacked from the south-west toward the direction of Berlin. They were part of Wenck&#x27;s XX Corps and were made up of men from the officer training schools, making them some of the best units the Germans had in reserve. They covered a distance of about , before being halted at the tip of Lake Schwielow, south-west of Potsdam and still from Berlin. During the night, General Wenck reported to the German Supreme Army Command in Fuerstenberg that his XII Army had been forced back along the entire front. According to Wenck, no attack on Berlin was possible. At that point, support from the IX Army could no longer be expected. In the meantime, about 25,000 German soldiers of the IX Army, along with several thousand civilians, succeeded in reaching the lines of the XII Army after breaking out of the Halbe pocket. The casualties on both sides were very high. Nearly 30,000 Germans were buried after the battle in the cemetery at Halbe. About 20,000 soldiers of the Red Army also died trying to stop the breakout; most are buried at a cemetery next to the Baruth-Zossen road. These are the known dead, but the remains of more who died in the battle are found every year, so the total of those who died will never be known. Nobody knows how many civilians died but it could have been as high as 10,000.

Having failed to break through to Berlin, Wenck&#x27;s XII Army made a fighting retreat back towards the Elbe and American lines after providing the IX Army survivors with surplus transport. By 6 May many German Army units and individuals had crossed the Elbe and surrendered to the US Ninth Army. Meanwhile, the XII Army&#x27;s bridgehead, with its headquarters in the park of Schönhausen, came under heavy Soviet artillery bombardment and was compressed into an area eight by two kilometres (five by one and a quarter miles).

===Surrender===
On the night of 2–3 May, General von Manteuffel, commander of the III Panzer Army along with General von Tippelskirch, commander of the XXI Army, surrendered to the US Army. Von Saucken&#x27;s II Army, that had been fighting north-east of Berlin in the Vistula Delta, surrendered to the Soviets on 9 May. On the morning of 7 May, the perimeter of the XII Army&#x27;s bridgehead began to collapse. Wenck crossed the Elbe under small arms fire that afternoon and surrendered to the American Ninth Army.

==Aftermath==
According to Grigoriy Krivosheev, declassified archival data gives 81,116 Soviet dead for the operation, including the battles of Seelow Heights and the Halbe. Another 280,251 were reported wounded or sick. The operation also cost the Soviets about 1,997 tanks and self-propelled guns. All losses were considered irrecoverable – i.e. beyond economic repair or no longer serviceable. The Soviets claimed to have captured nearly 480,000 German soldiers, while German research put the number of dead between 92,000 and 100,000. Some 125,000 civilians are estimated to have died during the entire operation.

In those areas that the Red Army had captured and before the fighting in the centre of the city had stopped, the Soviet authorities took measures to start restoring essential services. Almost all transport in and out of the city had been rendered inoperative, and bombed-out sewers had contaminated the city&#x27;s water supplies. The Soviet authorities appointed local Germans to head each city block, and organised the cleaning-up. The Red Army made a major effort to feed the residents of the city. Most Germans, both soldiers and civilians, were grateful to receive food issued at Red Army soup kitchens, which began on Colonel-General Berzarin&#x27;s orders. After the capitulation the Soviets went house to house, arresting and imprisoning anyone in a uniform including firemen and railwaymen.

During and immediately following the assault, in many areas of the city, vengeful Soviet troops (often rear echelon units) engaged in mass rape, pillage and murder. Oleg Budnitskii, historian at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, told a BBC Radio programme that Red Army soldiers were astounded when they reached Germany. &quot;For the first time in their lives, eight million Soviet people came abroad, the Soviet Union was a closed country. All they knew about foreign countries was there was unemployment, starvation and exploitation. And when they came to Europe they saw something very different from Stalinist Russia ... especially Germany. They were really furious, they could not understand why being so rich, Germans came to Russia&quot;. Other authors question the narrative of sexual violence by Red Army soldiers being more than what was a sad normality from all sides during the war, including the Western Allies. Nikolai Berzarin, commander of the Red Army in Berlin, quickly introduced penalties up to the death penalty for looting and rape.

Despite Soviet efforts to supply food and rebuild the city, starvation remained a problem. In June 1945, one month after the surrender, the average Berliner was getting only 64 percent of a daily ration of . Across the city over a million people were without homes.

==Commemoration==
All told, 402 Red Army personnel were bestowed the USSR&#x27;s highest degree of distinction, the title Hero of the Soviet Union (HSU), for their valor in Berlin&#x27;s immediate suburbs and in the city itself. Marshals of the Soviet Union Zhukov and Konev received their third and second HSU awards respectively, for their roles in the battle&#x27;s outcome. Combat medic Guards Senior Sergeant Lyudmila S. Kravets, was the Battle of Berlin&#x27;s only female HSU recipient for her valorous actions while serving in 1st Rifle Battalion, 63rd Guards Rifle Regiment, 23rd Guards Rifle Division (subordinate to 3rd Shock Army). Additionally, 280 Red Army enlisted personnel earned the Soviet Order of Glory First Class and attained status as Full Cavaliers of the Order of Glory for their heroism during the Battle of Berlin. In Soviet society, Full Cavaliers of the Order of Glory were accorded the same rights and privileges as Heroes of the Soviet Union.

Some 1.1 million Soviet personnel who took part in the capture of Berlin from 22 April to 2 May 1945 were awarded the Medal &quot;For the Capture of Berlin&quot;.

The design of the Victory Banner for celebrations of the Soviet Victory Day was defined by a federal law of Russia on 7 May 2007.

Poland&#x27;s official Flag Day is held each year on 2 May, the last day of the battle in Berlin, when the Polish Army hoisted its flag on the Berlin Victory Column.

<text>Sheldon Oberman (May 20, 1949 – March 26, 2004) was a Canadian children&#x27;s writer who lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Oberman (known to friends as Obie) grew up in the city&#x27;s North End. After graduating from St. Johns High School, he studied literature first at the University of Winnipeg and then at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Oberman lived and travelled through Canada, Europe and the Middle East before he returned to Winnipeg in 1973, where he received his teaching degree. In 1975, he started working as an English, Drama and Journalism teacher at Joseph Wolinsky Collegiate, a job he held for nearly 30 years.

Oberman started writing in the mid-seventies, inspired by bedtime stories he told his children. An important development in his career as a writer was the summer he spent at the Banff School of Fine Arts where he studied under W. O. Mitchell. Oberman published twelve books, including the award-winning &quot;Always Prayer Shawl&quot; (1999), &quot;The Shaman&#x27;s Nephew&quot; (1999; short-listed for the Governor General&#x27;s Award), &quot;The Island of the Minotaur&quot;, and &quot;Solomon and the Ant and other Jewish Folktales&quot; (2006), (published posthumously).

Oberman acted and directed in both film and stage plays, and toured North America as a professional storyteller. He wrote columns and freelance articles for the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; and published children&#x27;s songs, stories and poems in a number of magazines, journals and anthologies.

He died of stomach cancer on March 26, 2004.

<text>Communications of the ACM is the monthly journal of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). It was established in 1958, with Saul Rosen as its first managing editor. It is sent to all ACM members.
Articles are intended for readers with backgrounds in all areas of computer science and information systems. The focus is on the practical implications of advances in information technology and associated management issues; ACM also publishes a variety of more theoretical journals. The magazine straddles the boundary of a science magazine, trade magazine, and a scientific journal. While the content is subject to peer review, the articles published are often summaries of research that may also be published elsewhere. Material published must be accessible and relevant to a broad readership.

From 1960 onward, &quot;CACM&quot; also published algorithms, expressed in ALGOL. The collection of algorithms later became known as the Collected Algorithms of the ACM.

CACM announced a transition to entirely open access in February 2024, as part of ACM&#x27;s commitment to make all articles open access. 

According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has a 2023 impact factor of 22.7.

<text>Legio XIX (&quot;Nineteenth Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army. It was destroyed in 9 AD in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. The emblem of the XIXth legion is unknown but was probably the Capricorn like other legions levied by Augustus.

== History ==
It was founded in 41 or 40 BC by Augustus. Their first assignment was in Sicily where Sextus Pompey, son of Pompey, was leading a revolt. This revolt put Rome&#x27;s grain supply in peril and it needed a harsh response.

In 30 BC, veterans of the XIX legion were settled near Pisa, and after that, the rest of the legion was allocated in the Rhine frontier with base camp at Cologne. The XIX legion participated in the German campaigns of Drusus (13–9 BC) and Tiberius (8–5 BC). By the year 5 BC Germania was a Roman province and Publius Quinctilius Varus was assigned as governor.

The legion could have been stationed in Dangstetten. It is possible the reason the legion was stationed here was to police the nearby Roman Road.

In September 9 AD, Arminius, leader of the Cherusci and a Roman ally, set a trap. He had reported a major revolt of one of the western tribes and suggested the return of both governor and his legions to the Rhine. Varus accepted the suggestion and went with the XVII, XVIII and XIX legions. The army was trapped near Osnabrück and was completely destroyed in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Between 16 and 18, Germanicus, the leader of the Rhine armies, looked for the remains of the legions. The Legion XIX Eagle was captured by the Bructeri. In 15 AD troops under the command of Lucius Stertinius rescued the eagle: After its destruction, the Romans never used this legion number again.

<doc id="291164" wikidata="Q156449" url="?curid=291164" title="Nymphalidae">
<text>The Nymphalidae are the largest family of butterflies, with more than 6,000 species distributed throughout most of the world. Belonging to the superfamily Papilionoidea, they are usually medium-sized to large butterflies. Most species have a reduced pair of forelegs and many hold their colourful wings flat when resting. They are also called brush-footed butterflies or four-footed butterflies, because they are known to stand on only four legs while the other two are curled up; in some species, these forelegs have a brush-like set of hairs, which gives this family its other common name. Many species are brightly coloured and include popular species such as the emperors, monarch butterfly, admirals, tortoiseshells, and fritillaries. However, the under wings are, in contrast, often dull and in some species look remarkably like dead leaves, or are much paler, producing a cryptic effect that helps the butterflies blend into their surroundings.

== Nomenclature ==

Rafinesque introduced the name Nymphalia as a subfamily name in diurnal Lepidoptera. Rafinesque did not include &quot;Nymphalis&quot; among the listed genera, but &quot;Nymphalis&quot; was unequivocally implied in the formation of the name (Code Article 11.7.1.1). The attribution of the Nymphalidae to Rafinesque has now been widely adopted.
== Morphology ==

In the adult butterflies, the first pair of legs is small or reduced, giving the family the other names of four-footed or brush-footed butterflies. The caterpillars are hairy or spiky with projections on the head, and the chrysalids have shiny spots.

The forewings have the submedial vein (vein 1) unbranched and in one subfamily forked near the base; the medial vein has three branches, veins 2, 3, and 4; veins 5 and 6 arise from the points of junction of the discocellulars; the subcostal vein and its continuation beyond the apex of cell, vein 7, has never more than four branches, veins 8–11; 8 and 9 always arise from vein 7, 10, and 11 sometimes from vein 7 but more often free, i.e., given off by the subcostal vein before apex of the cell.

The hindwings have internal (1a) and precostal veins. The cell in both wings is closed or open, often closed in the fore, open in the hindwing. The dorsal margin of the hindwing is channelled to receive the abdomen in many of the forms.

The antennae always have two grooves on the underside; the club is variable in shape. Throughout the family, the front pair of legs in the male, and with three exceptions (&quot;Libythea&quot;, &quot;Pseudergolis&quot;, and &quot;Calinaga&quot;) in the female also, is reduced in size and functionally impotent; in some, the atrophy of the forelegs is considerable, e.g., the Danainae and Satyrinae. In many of the forms of these subfamilies, the forelegs are kept pressed against the underside of the thorax, and are in the male often very inconspicuous.

=== Systematics and phylogeny ===

The phylogeny of the Nymphalidae is complex. Several taxa are of unclear position, reflecting the fact that some subfamilies were formerly well-recognized as distinct families due to insufficient study.

The five main clades within the family are:

The libytheine clade (basal)

* Libytheinae (snout butterflies, earlier treated as the distinct family Libytheidae)

The danaine clade (basal)

* Danainae (milkweed butterflies, earlier treated as the distinct family Danaidae)
: Host plant families include Apocynaceae, Asclepiadoideae (subfamily of Apocynaceae), and Moraceae.
:* Ithomiini (about 300 Neotropical species, sometimes considered a subfamily Ithomiinae)
:: Most species have long wings, and some have transparent wings. Host plants are in the families Apocynaceae, Gesneriaceae, and Solanaceae.
:* Tellervini (about 6–10 species in Australasia, sometimes considered a subfamily Tellervinae)
:: Caterpillars resemble those of the Danainae and feed on Apocynaceae.

The satyrine clade

* Calinaginae (about six species, restricted to the Himalayas)
: Mimics of the Danainae, they are restricted to host plants in the family Moraceae.
* Charaxinae
: Tropical canopy butterflies, the caterpillars often have head spines or projections. Mostly edible species, have some Batesian mimics. Host plants are in the families Annonaceae, Celastraceae, Convolvulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Lauraceae, Myrtaceae, Piperaceae, Poaceae, Rhamnaceae, Rutaceae, Santalaceae, and Sapindaceae.
* Morphinae (including Amathusiini, sometimes considered a subfamily Amathusiinae)
: Include the spectacular neotropical &quot;Morpho&quot;, its food plants include the Arecaceae, Bignoniaceae, Fabaceae, Menispermaceae, Poaceae, and Sapindaceae.
:* Brassolini (owls, neotropical with 70–80 species, mostly crepuscular, sometimes considered a subfamily Brassolinae)
:: Host plants in the families Arecaceae, Bromeliaceae, Heliconiaceae, Musaceae, and Poaceae.
* Satyrinae (satyrs and browns, earlier treated as distinct family Satyridae)
: Host plants are in the families Arecaceae, Araceae, Cyperaceae, Heliconiaceae, Poaceae, and Selaginellaceae.

The heliconiine clade (sister group of the nymphaline clade, excludes former tribes Biblidini and Cyrestini, and tribes Pseudergolini and Coeini)

* Heliconiinae (earlier treated as distinct family Heliconiidae)
: Colourful tropical butterflies, they are noted for Müllerian mimicry. All species use host plants in the family Passifloraceae.
:* Acraeini (mostly African, but some species in Asia, sometimes considered a family Acraeinae)
:: Host plants are in the families Asteraceae, Passifloraceae, Sterculiaceae, Tiliaceae, and Urticaceae.
* Limenitidinae

The nymphaline clade (sister group of the heliconiine clade, also includes tribes Coeini and Pseudergolini)

* Apaturinae (mostly tropical)
: Host plants are in the family Ulmaceae. Caterpillars are smooth with bifid tails and horns on the head.
* Biblidinae (formerly in Limenitidinae)
* Cyrestinae (formerly in Limenitidinae)
* Nymphalinae (a large subfamily that sometimes includes the Limenitidinae and Biblidinae)
: Some species migrate. Caterpillars are sometimes covered in spines. Host plants include Acanthaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Convolvulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fagaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Lamiaceae, Loranthaceae, Moraceae, Plantaginaceae, Poaceae, Rubiaceae, Rutaceae, Salicaceae, Sapindaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Urticaceae, and Verbenaceae.

==Morphology==

The trait for which these butterflies are most known is the use of only four legs; the reason their forelegs have become vestigial is not yet completely clear. Some suggest the forelegs are used to amplify the sense of smell, because some species possess a brush-like set of soft hair called setae, which has led researchers to believe the forelegs are used to improve signaling and communication between the species, while standing in the other four. This ability proves useful in terms of reproduction and the overall health of the species, and it is the leading theory so far.

<text>In organic chemistry, an alkyl group is an alkane missing one hydrogen.
The term &quot;alkyl&quot; is intentionally unspecific to include many possible substitutions. 
An acyclic alkyl has the general formula of . A cycloalkyl group is derived from a cycloalkane by removal of a hydrogen atom from a ring and has the general formula .
Typically an alkyl is a part of a larger molecule. In structural formulae, the symbol R is used to designate a generic (unspecified) alkyl group. The smallest alkyl group is methyl, with the formula .

== Related concepts ==
Alkylation is the addition of alkyl groups to molecules, often by alkylating agents such as alkyl halides. 

Alkylating antineoplastic agents are a class of compounds that are used to treat cancer. In such case, the term alkyl is used loosely. For example, nitrogen mustards are well-known alkylating agents, but they are not simple hydrocarbons.

In chemistry, alkyl is a group, a substituent, that is attached to other molecular fragments. For example, alkyl lithium reagents have the empirical formula Li(alkyl), where alkyl = methyl, ethyl, etc. A &quot;dialkyl&quot; ether is an ether with two alkyl groups, e.g., diethyl ether .

==In medicinal chemistry==
In medicinal chemistry, the incorporation of alkyl chains into some chemical compounds increases their lipophilicity. This strategy has been used to increase the antimicrobial activity of flavanones and chalcones.

==Alkyl cations, anions, and radicals==
Usually, alkyl groups are attached to other atoms or groups of atoms. Free alkyls occur as neutral radicals, as anions, or as cations. The cations are called carbocations. The anions are called carbanions. The neutral alkyl free radicals have no special name. Such species are usually encountered only as transient intermediates. However, persistent alkyl radicals with half-lives &quot;from seconds to years&quot; have been prepared. Typically alkyl cations are generated using superacids and alkyl anions are observed in the presence of strong bases. Alkyl radicals can be generated by a photochemical reaction or by homolytic cleavage. Alkyls are commonly observed in mass spectrometry of organic compounds. Simple alkyls (especially methyl) are observed in the interstellar space as well.

==Nomenclature==
Alkyl groups form homologous series. The simplest series have the general formula . Alkyls include &quot;methyl&quot;, (), &quot;ethyl&quot; (), &quot;propyl&quot; (), &quot;butyl&quot; (), &quot;pentyl&quot; (), and so on. Alkyl groups that contain one ring have the formula , e.g. cyclopropyl and cyclohexyl. The formula of alkyl radicals are the same as alkyl groups, except the free valence &quot;&quot; is replaced by the dot &quot;•&quot; and adding &quot;radical&quot; to the name of the alkyl group (e.g. methyl radical ).

The naming convention is taken from IUPAC nomenclature:


The prefixes taken from IUPAC nomenclature are used to name branched chained structures by their substituent groups, for example 3-methylpentane:

The structure of 3-methylpentane is viewed as consisting of two parts. First, five atoms comprise the longest straight chain of carbon centers. The parent five-carbon compound is named pentane (highlighted blue). The methyl &quot;substituent&quot; or &quot;group&quot; is highlighted red. According to the usual rules of nomenclature, alkyl groups are included in the name of the molecule before the root, as in methylpentane. This name is, however, ambiguous, as the methyl branch could be on various carbon atoms. Thus, the name is 3-methylpentane to avoid ambiguity: The 3- is because the methyl is attached to the third of the five carbon atoms.

If there is more than one of the same alkyl group attached to a chain, then the prefixes are used on the alkyl groups to indicate multiples (i.e., di, tri, tetra, etc.)

This compound is known as 2,3,3-trimethylpentane. Here three identical alkyl groups attached to carbon atoms 2, 3, and 3. The numbers are included in the name to avoid ambiguity about the position of the groups, and &quot;tri&quot; indicates that there are three identical methyl groups. If one of the methyl groups attached to the third carbon atom were instead an ethyl group, then the name would be 3-ethyl-2,3-dimethylpentane. When there are different alkyl groups, they are listed in alphabetical order.

In addition, each position on an alkyl chain can be described according to how many other carbon atoms are attached to it. The terms primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary refer to a carbon attached to one, two, three, or four other carbons respectively.
==Etymology==
The first named alkyl radical was ethyl, named so by Liebig in 1833 from the German word &quot;Äther&quot; (which in turn had been derived from the Greek word &quot;aither&quot; meaning &quot;air&quot;, for the substance now known as diethyl ether) and the Greek word ύλη (hyle), meaning &quot;matter&quot;. This was followed by methyl (Dumas and Peligot in 1834, meaning &quot;spirit of wood&quot;) and amyl (Auguste Cahours in 1840). The word alkyl was introduced by Johannes Wislicenus in or before 1882, based on the German word &quot;Alkoholradikale&quot; and then-common suffix -yl.

<text>In chemistry, an open-chain compound (or open chain compound) or acyclic compound (Greek prefix &quot;α&quot; &#x27;without&#x27; and &quot;κύκλος&quot; &#x27;cycle&#x27;) is a compound with a linear structure, rather than a cyclic one.
An open-chain compound having no side groups is called a straight-chain compound (also spelled as straight chain compound). Many of the simple molecules of organic chemistry, such as the alkanes and alkenes, have both linear and ring isomers, that is, both acyclic and cyclic. For those with 4 or more carbons, the linear forms can have straight-chain or branched-chain isomers. The lowercase prefix &quot;n-&quot; denotes the straight-chain isomer; for example, &quot;n&quot;-butane is straight-chain butane, whereas &quot;i&quot;-butane is isobutane. Cycloalkanes are isomers of alkenes, not of alkanes, because the ring&#x27;s closure involves a C-C bond. Having no rings (aromatic or otherwise), all open-chain compounds are aliphatic.

Typically in biochemistry, some isomers are more prevalent than others. For example, in living organisms, the open-chain isomer of glucose usually exists only transiently, in small amounts; D-glucose is the usual isomer; and L-glucose is rare.

Straight-chain molecules are often not literally straight, in the sense that their bond angles are often not 180°, but the name reflects that they are schematically straight. For example, the straight-chain alkanes are wavy or &quot;puckered&quot;, as the models below show.

<text>Pythagoreanism originated in the 6th century BC, based on and around the teachings and beliefs held by Pythagoras and his followers, the Pythagoreans. Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community in the ancient Greek colony of Kroton, in modern Calabria (Italy) circa 530 BC. Early Pythagorean communities spread throughout Magna Graecia.

Already during Pythagoras&#x27; life it is likely that the distinction between the &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; (&quot;those who listen&quot;), who is conventionally regarded as more concerned with religious, and ritual elements, and associated with the oral tradition, and the &quot;mathematikoi&quot; (&quot;those who learn&quot;) existed. The ancient biographers of Pythagoras, Iamblichus () and his master Porphyry ( ) seem to make the distinction of the two as that of &#x27;beginner&#x27; and &#x27;advanced&#x27;. As the Pythagorean cenobites practiced an esoteric path, like the mystery schools of antiquity, the adherents, &quot;akousmatikoi&quot;, following initiation became &quot;mathematikoi&quot;. It is wrong to say that the Pythagoreans were superseded by the Cynics in the 4th century BC, but it seems to be a distinction mark of the Cynics to disregard the hierarchy and protocol, ways of initiatory proceedings significant for the Pythagorean community; subsequently did the Greek philosophical traditions become more diverse. The Platonic Academy was arguably a Pythagorean cenobitic institution, outside the city walls of Athens in the 4th century BC. As a sacred grove dedicated to Athena, and Hecademos (Academos). The academy, the sacred grove of Academos, may have existed, as the contemporaries seem to have believed, since the Bronze Age, even pre-existing the Trojan War. Yet according to Plutarch it was the Athenian strategos (general) Kimon Milkiadou () who converted this, &quot;waterless and arid spot into a well watered grove, which he provided with clear running-tracks and shady walks&quot;. Plato (less known as Aristocles) lived almost a hundred years later, circa 427 to 348 BC. On the other hand, it seems likely that this was a part of the re-building of Athens led by Kimon Milkiadou and Themistocles, following the Achaemenid destruction of Athens in 480–479 BC during the war with Persia. Kimon is at least associated with the building of the southern Wall of Themistocles, the city walls of ancient Athens. It seems likely that the Athenians saw this as a rejuvenation of the sacred grove of Academos.

Following political instability in Magna Graecia, some Pythagorean philosophers moved to mainland Greece while others regrouped in Rhegium. By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy. Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato and through him, on all of Western philosophy. Many of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originate with Aristotle and the philosophers of the Peripatetic school.

As a philosophic tradition, Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC, giving rise to Neopythagoreanism. The worship of Pythagoras continued in Italy and as a religious community Pythagoreans appear to have survived as part of, or deeply influenced, the Bacchic cults and Orphism.

==History==


Pythagoras was already well known in ancient times for his supposed mathematical achievement of the Pythagorean theorem. Pythagoras had been credited with discovering that in a right-angled triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In ancient times Pythagoras was also noted for his discovery that music had mathematical foundations. Antique sources that credit Pythagoras as the philosopher who first discovered music intervals also credit him as the inventor of the monochord, a straight rod on which a string and a movable bridge could be used to demonstrate the relationship of musical intervals.

Much of the surviving sources on Pythagoras originated with Aristotle and the philosophers of the Peripatetic school, which founded historiographical academic traditions such as biography, doxography and the history of science. The surviving 5th century BC sources on Pythagoras and early Pythagoreanism are void of supernatural elements, while surviving 4th century BC sources on Pythagoras&#x27; teachings introduced legend and fable. Philosophers who discussed Pythagoreanism, such as Anaximander, Andron of Ephesus, Heraclides and Neanthes had access to historical written sources as well as the oral tradition about Pythagoreanism, which by the 4th century BC was in decline. Neopythagorean philosophers, who authored many of the surviving sources on Pythagoreanism, continued the tradition of legend and fantasy.

The earliest surviving ancient source on Pythagoras and his followers is a satire by Xenophanes, on the Pythagorean beliefs on the transmigration of souls. Xenophanes wrote of Pythagoras that:

In a surviving fragment from Heraclitus, Pythagoras and his followers are described as follows:

Two other surviving fragments of ancient sources on Pythagoras are by Ion of Chios and Empedocles. Both were born in the 490s, after Pythagoras&#x27; death. By that time, he was known as a sage and his fame had spread throughout Greece. According to Ion, Pythagoras was:

Empedocles described Pythagoras as &quot;a man of surpassing knowledge, master especially of all kinds of wise works, who had acquired the upmost wealth of understanding&quot;. In the 4th century BC the Sophist Alcidamas wrote that Pythagoras was widely honored by Italians.

Today scholars typically distinguish two periods of Pythagoreanism: early-Pythagoreanism, from the 6th until the 5th century BC, and late-Pythagoreanism, from the 4th until the 3rd century BC. The Spartan colony of Taranto in Italy became the home for many practitioners of Pythagoreanism and later for Neopythagorean philosophers. Pythagoras had also lived in Crotone and Metaponto, both of which were Achaean colonies. Early-Pythagorean sects lived in Croton and throughout Magna Graecia. They espoused to a rigorous life of the intellect and strict rules on diet, clothing and behavior. Their burial rites were tied to their belief in the immortality of the soul.

Early-Pythagorean sects were closed societies and new Pythagoreans were chosen based on merit and discipline. Ancient sources record that early-Pythagoreans underwent a five-year initiation period of listening to the teachings (&quot;akousmata&quot;) in silence. Initiates could through a test become members of the inner circle. However, Pythagoreans could also leave the community if they wished. Iamblichus listed 235 Pythagoreans by name, among them 17 women whom he described as the &quot;most famous&quot; women practitioners of Pythagoreanism. It was customary that family members became Pythagoreans, as Pythagoreanism developed into a philosophic tradition that entailed rules for everyday life and Pythagoreans were bound by secrets. The home of Pythagoras was known as the site of mysteries.

Pythagoras had been born on the island of Samos at around 570 BC and left his homeland at around 530 BC in opposition to the policies of Polycrates. Before settling in Croton, Pythagoras had traveled throughout Egypt and Babylonia. In Croton, Pythagoras established the first Pythagorean community, described as a secret society, and attained political influence. In the early 5th century BC Croton acquired great military and economic importance. Pythagoras emphasised moderation, piety, respect for elders and of the state, and advocated a monogamous family structure. The Croton Council appointed him to official positions. Among others Pythagoras was in charge of education in the city. His influence as political reformer reputedly extended to other Greek colonies in southern Italy and in Sicily. Pythagoras died shortly after an arson attack on the Pythagorean meeting place in Croton.

The anti-Pythagorean attacks in were headed by Cylon of Croton. Pythagoras escaped to Metapontium. After these initial attacks and the death of Pythagoras, Pythagorean communities in Croton and elsewhere continued to flourish. At around 450 BC attacks on Pythagorean communities were carried out across Magna Graecia. In Croton, a house where Pythagoreans gathered was set on fire and all but two of the Pythagorean philosophers burned alive. Pythagorean meeting places in other cities were also attacked and philosophic leaders killed. These attacks occurred in the context of widespread violence and destruction in Magna Graecia. Following the political instability in the region, some Pythagorean philosophers fled to mainland Greece while others regrouped in Rhegium. By about 400 BC the majority of Pythagorean philosophers had left Italy. Archytas remained in Italy and ancient sources record that he was visited there by young Plato in the early 4th century BC. The Pythagorean schools and societies died out from the 4th century BC. Pythagorean philosophers continued to practice, albeit no organised communities were established.

According to surviving sources by the Neopythagorean philosopher Nicomachus, Philolaus was the successor of Pythagoras. According to Cicero (de Orat. III 34.139), Philolaus was teacher of Archytas. According to the Neoplatonist philosopher Iamblichus, Archytas in turn became the head of the Pythagorean school about a century after the Pythagoras&#x27; death. Philolaus, Eurytus and Xenophilus are identified by Aristoxenus as the teachers of the last generation of Pythagoreans.

== Philosophic traditions ==
Following Pythagoras&#x27; death, disputes about his teachings led to the development of two philosophical traditions within Pythagoreanism in Italy: &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; and &quot;mathēmatikoi&quot;. The &quot;mathēmatikoi&quot; recognised the &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; as fellow Pythagoreans, but because the &quot;mathēmatikoi&quot; allegedly followed the teachings of Hippasus, the &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; philosophers did not recognise them. Despite this, both groups were regarded by their contemporaries as practitioners of Pythagoreanism.

The &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; were superseded in the 4th century BC as a significant mendicant school of philosophy by the Cynics. &quot;Mathēmatikoi&quot; philosophers were in the 4th century BC absorbed into the Platonic school of Speusippus, Xenocrates and Polemon. As a philosophic tradition, Pythagoreanism was revived in the 1st century BC, giving rise to Neopythagoreanism. The worship of Pythagoras continued in Italy in the two intervening centuries. As a religious community Pythagoreans appear to have survived as part of, or deeply influenced, the Bacchic cults and Orphism.

=== &quot;Akousmatikoi&quot; ===

The &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; believed that humans had to act in appropriate ways. The &quot;Akousmata&quot; (translated as &quot;oral saying&quot;) was the collection of all the sayings of Pythagoras as divine dogma. The tradition of the &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; resisted any reinterpretation or philosophical evolution of Pythagoras&#x27; teachings. Individuals who strictly followed most &quot;akousmata&quot; were regarded as wise. The &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; philosophers refused to recognise that the continuous development of mathematical and scientific research conducted by the &quot;mathēmatikoi&quot; was in line with Pythagoras&#x27;s intention. Until the demise of Pythagoreanism in the 4th century BC, the &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; continued to engage in a pious life by practicing silence, dressing simply and avoiding meat, for the purpose of attaining a privileged afterlife. The &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; engaged deeply in questions of Pythagoras&#x27; moral teachings, concerning matters such as harmony, justice, ritual purity and moral behavior.

=== &quot;Mathēmatikoi&quot; ===
The &quot;mathēmatikoi&quot; acknowledged the religious underpinning of Pythagoreanism and engaged in &quot;mathēma&quot; (translated as &quot;learning&quot; or &quot;studying&quot;) as part of their practice. While their scientific pursuits were largely mathematical, they also promoted other fields of scientific study in which Pythagoras had engaged during his lifetime. A sectarianism developed between the dogmatic &quot;akousmatikoi&quot; and the &quot;mathēmatikoi&quot;, who in their intellectual activism became regarded as increasingly progressive. This tension persisted until the 4th century BC, when the philosopher Archytas engaged in advanced mathematics as part of his devotion to Pythagoras&#x27; teachings.

Today, Pythagoras is mostly remembered for his mathematical ideas, and by association with the work early Pythagoreans did in advancing mathematical concepts and theories on harmonic musical intervals, the definition of numbers, proportion and mathematical methods such as arithmetic and geometry. The &quot;mathēmatikoi&quot; philosophers claimed that numbers were at the heart of everything and constructed a new view of the cosmos. In the &quot;mathēmatikoi&quot; tradition of Pythagoreanism the Earth was removed from the center of the universe. The &quot;mathēmatikoi&quot; believed that the Earth, along with other celestial bodies, orbited around a central fire. This, they believed, constituted a celestial harmony.

===Rituals===
Pythagoreanism was a philosophic tradition as well as a religious practice. As a religious community they relied on oral teachings and worshiped the Pythian Apollo, the oracular god of Delphic Oracle. Pythagoreans preached an austere life. They believed that the soul was buried in the body, which acted as a tomb for the soul in this life. The highest reward a human could attain was for the soul to join in the life of the gods and thus escaped the cycle of reincarnation in another human body. Like the practitioners of Orphism, a religious tradition that developed in parallel to Pythagorean religious practice, Pythagoreanism held that the soul was buried in the body as a punishment for a committed offense and that the soul could be purified. Aside from conducting their daily lives according to strict rules Pythagorean also engaged in rituals to attain purity. The 4th century Greek historian and sceptic philosopher Hecataeus of Abdera asserted that Pythagoras had been inspired by ancient Egyptian philosophy in his use of ritual regulations and his belief in reincarnation.

==Philosophy==
Early Pythagoreanism was based on research and the accumulation of knowledge from the books written by other philosophers. Pythagoras&#x27; philosophic teachings made direct reference to the philosophy of Anaximander, Anaximenes of Miletus and Pherecydes of Syros. Of the Pythagorean philosophers, Hippasus, Alcmaeon, Hippon, Archytas and Theodorus, written sources have survived.

===Arithmetic and numbers===
Pythagoras, in his teachings focused on the significance of numerology, he believed that numbers themselves explained the true nature of the Universe. &quot;Numbers&quot; were in the Greek world of Pythagoras&#x27; days &quot;natural numbers&quot; – that is positive integers (there was no zero). But unlike their Greek contemporaries, the Pythagorean philosophers represented numbers graphically, not symbolically through letters. Pythagoreans used dots, also known as &quot;psiphi&quot; (pebbles), to represent numbers in triangles, squares, rectangles and pentagons. This enabled a visual comprehension of mathematics and allowed for a geometrical exploration of numerical relationships. Pythagorean philosophers investigated the relationship of numbers extensively. They defined &quot;perfect numbers&quot; as those that were equal to the sum of all their divisors. For example: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. The theory of odd and even numbers was central to Pythagorean arithmetic. This distinction was for the Pythagorean philosophers direct and visual, as they arranged triangular dots so that the even and odd numbers successively alternate: 2, 4, 6, ... 3, 5, 7, ...

Early-Pythagorean philosophers such as Philolaus and Archytas held the conviction that mathematics could help in addressing important philosophical problems. In Pythagoreanism numbers became related to intangible concepts. The &quot;one&quot; was related to the intellect and being, the &quot;two&quot; to thought, the number &quot;four&quot; was related to justice because 2 * 2 = 4 and equally even. A dominant symbolism was awarded to the number &quot;three&quot;, Pythagoreans believed that the whole world and all things in it are summed up in this number, because end, middle and beginning give the number of the whole. The triad had for Pythagoreans an ethical dimension, as the goodness of each person was believed to be threefold: prudence, drive and good fortune.

Pythagoreans thought numbers existed &quot;outside of [human] minds&quot; and separate from the world. They had many mystical and magical interpretations of the roles of numbers in governing existence.

===Geometry===
The Pythagoreans engaged with geometry as a liberal philosophy which served to establish principles and allowed theorems to be explored abstractly and rationally. Pythagorean philosophers believed that there was a close relationship between numbers and geometrical forms. Early-Pythagorean philosophers proved simple geometrical theorems, including &quot;the sum of the angles of a triangle equals two right angles&quot;. Pythagoreans also came up with three of the five platonic solids: the tetrahedron, the cube and the dodecahedron. The sides of a regular dodecahedron are regular pentagons, which for Pythagoreans symbolised health. They also revered the pentagram, as each diagonal divides the two others at the golden ratio. When linear geometrical figures replaced the dots, the combination of Babylonian algebra and Pythagorean arithmetic provided the basis for Greek geometric algebra. By attempting to establish a system of concrete and permanent rules, Pythagoreans helped to establish strict axiomatic procedures of solving mathematical problems.

===Music===
Pythagoras pioneered the mathematical and experimental study of music. He objectively measured physical quantities, such as the length of a string and discovered quantitative mathematical relationships of music through arithmetic ratios. Pythagoras attempted to explain subjective psychological and aesthetic feelings, such as the enjoyment of musical harmony. Pythagoras and his students experimented systematically with strings of varying length and tension, with wind instruments, with brass discs of the same diameter but different thickness, and with identical vases filled with different levels of water. Early Pythagoreans established quantitative ratios between the length of a string or pipe and the pitch of notes and the frequency of string vibration.

Pythagoras is credited with discovering that the most harmonious musical intervals are created by the simple numerical ratio of the first four natural numbers which derive respectively from the relations of string length: the octave (1/2), the fifth (2/3) and the fourth (3/4). The sum of those numbers 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 was for Pythagoreans the perfect number, because it contained in itself &quot;the whole essential nature of numbers&quot;. Werner Heisenberg has called this formulation of musical arithmetic as &quot;among the most powerful advances of human science&quot; because it enables the measurement of sound in space.

Pythagorean tuning is a system of musical tuning in which the frequency ratios of all intervals are based on the ratio 3:2. This ratio, also known as the &quot;pure&quot; perfect fifth, is chosen because it is one of the most consonant and easiest to tune by ear and because of importance attributed to the integer 3. As Novalis put it, &quot;The musical proportions seem to me to be particularly correct natural proportions.&quot;

The fact that mathematics could explain the human sentimental world had a profound impact on the Pythagorean philosophy. Pythagoreanism became the quest for establishing the fundamental essences of reality. Pythagorean philosophers advanced the unshakable belief that the essence of all things are numbers and that the universe was sustained by harmony. According to ancient sources music was central to the lives of those practicing Pythagoreanism. They used medicines for the purification (&quot;katharsis&quot;) of the body and, according to Aristoxenus, music for the purification of the soul. Pythagoreans used different types of music to arouse or calm their souls, and certain stirring songs could have notes that existed in the same ratio as the &quot;distances of the heavenly bodies from the centre of&quot; Earth.

===Harmony===
For Pythagoreans, harmony signified the &quot;unification of a multifarious composition and the agreement of unlike spirits&quot;. In Pythagoreanism, numeric harmony was applied in mathematical, medical, psychological, aesthetic, metaphysical and cosmological problems. For Pythagorean philosophers, the basic property of numbers was expressed in the harmonious interplay of opposite pairs. Harmony assured the balance of opposite forces. Pythagoras had in his teachings named numbers and the symmetries of them as the first principle and called these numeric symmetries harmony. This numeric harmony could be discovered in rules throughout nature. Numbers governed the properties and conditions of all beings and were regarded the causes of being in everything else. Pythagorean philosophers believed that numbers were the elements of all beings and the universe as a whole was composed of harmony and numbers.

===Cosmology===
The philosopher Philolaus, one of the most prominent figures in Pythagoreanism, was the precursor of Copernicus in moving the earth from the center of the cosmos and making it a planet. According to Aristotle&#x27;s student Eudemus of Cyprus, the first philosopher to determine quantitatively the size of the known planets and the distance between them was Anaximander, a teacher to Pythagoras, in the 6th century BC. Historic sources credit the Pythagorean philosophers with being the first to attempt a clarification of the planet sequence. The early-Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus believed that limited and unlimited things were the components of the cosmos, and these had existed ever since. The center of the universe, according to Philolaus, was the number one (&quot;hēn&quot;), which equated to the unity of Monism. Philolaus called the number one an &quot;even-odd&quot; because it was able to generate both even and odd numbers. When one was added to an odd number it produced an even number, and when added to an even number it produced an odd number. Philolaus further reasoned that the fitting together of the earth and the universe corresponded to the construction of the number one out of the even and the odd. Pythagorean philosophers believed that the even was unlimited and the odd was limited.

Aristotle recorded in the 4th century BC on the Pythagorean astronomical system: 
:It remains to speak of the earth, of its position, of the question whether it is at rest or in motion, and of its shape. As to its position, there is some difference of opinion. Most people–all, in fact, who regard the whole heaven as finite–say it lies at the center. But the Italian philosophers known as Pythagoreans take the contrary view. At the centre, they say, is fire, and the earth is one of the stars, creating night and day by its circular motion about the center. They further construct another earth in opposition to ours to which they give the name counterearth.

It is not known whether Philolaus believed Earth to be round or flat, but he did not believe the earth rotated, so that the Counter-Earth and the Central Fire were both not visible from Earth&#x27;s surface, or at least not from the hemisphere where Greece was located. But the conclusion of Pythagorean philosophers that the universe is not geocentric was not based on empirical observation. Instead, as Aristotle noted, the Pythagorean view of the astronomical system was grounded in a fundamental reflection on the value of individual things and the hierarchical order of the universe.

Pythagoreans believed in a &quot;musica universalis&quot;. They reasoned that stars must produce a sound because they were large swiftly moving bodies. Pythagoreans also determined that stars revolved at distances and speeds that were proportional to each other. They reasoned that because of this numerical proportion the revolution of the stars produced a harmonic sound. The early-Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus argued that the structure of the cosmos was determined by the musical numerical proportions of the diatonic octave, which contained the fifth and fourth harmonic intervals.

===Justice===
Pythagoreans equated justice with geometrical proportion, because proportion ensured that each part receives what it is due. Early-Pythagoreans believed that after the death of the body, the soul would be punished or rewarded. Humans could, through their conduct, ensure that their soul was admitted to another world. The reincarnation in this world equated to a punishment. In Pythagoreanism life in this world is social and in the realm of society justice existed when each part of society received its due. The Pythagorean tradition of universal justice was later referenced by Plato. For Pythagorean philosophers the soul was the source of justice and through the harmony of the soul, divinity could be achieved. Injustice inverted the natural order. According to the 4th century BC philosopher Heraclides Ponticus, Pythagoras taught that &quot;happiness consists in knowledge of the perfection of the numbers of the soul. A surviving fragment from the 3rd century BC by the late-Pythagorean philosopher Aesara reasoned that:

===Body and soul===

Pythagoreans believed that body and soul functioned together, and a healthy body required a healthy psyche. Early Pythagoreans conceived of the soul as the seat of sensation and emotion. They regarded the soul as distinct from the intellect. However, only fragments of the early Pythagorean texts have survived, and it is not certain whether they believed the soul was immortal. The surviving texts of the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus indicate that while early Pythagoreans did not believe that the soul contained all psychological faculties, the soul was life and a harmony of physical elements. As such the soul passed away when certain arrangements of these elements ceased to exist.

However, the teaching most securely identified with Pythagoras is &quot;metempsychosis&quot;, or the &quot;transmigration of souls&quot;, which holds that every soul is immortal and, upon death, enters into a new body. Pythagorean metempsychosis resembles the teachings of the Orphics, although its version contains substantial differences. Unlike the Orphics, who considered metempsychosis a cycle of grief that could be escaped by attaining liberation from it, Pythagoras seems to postulate an eternal, endless reincarnation where subsequent lives would not be conditioned by any action done in the previous.

===Vegetarianism===
Some medieval authors refer to a &quot;Pythagorean diet&quot;, entailing the abstention from eating meat, beans or fish. Pythagoreans believed that a vegetarian diet fostered a healthy body and enhanced the search for Arete. The purpose of vegetarianism in Pythagoreanism was not self-denial; instead, it was regarded as conducive to the best in a human being. Pythagoreans advanced a grounded theory on the treatment of animals. They believed that any being that experienced pain or suffering should not have pain inflicted on it unnecessarily. Because it was not necessary to inflict pain on animals for humans to enjoy a healthy diet, they believed that animals should not be killed for the purpose of eating them. The Pythagoreans advanced the argument that unless an animal posed a threat to a human, it was not justifiable to kill an animal and that doing so would diminish the moral status of a human. By failing to show justice to the animal, humans diminish themselves.

Pythagoreans believed that human beings were animals, but with an advanced intellect and therefore humans had to purify themselves through training. Through purification humans could join the psychic force that pervaded the cosmos. Pythagoreans reasoned that the logic of this argument could not be avoided by killing an animal painlessly. The Pythagoreans also thought that animals were sentient and minimally rational. The arguments advanced by Pythagoreans convinced numerous of their philosopher contemporaries to adopt a vegetarian diet. The Pythagorean sense of kinship with non-humans positioned them as a counterculture in the dominant meat-eating culture. The philosopher Empedocles is said to have refused the customary blood sacrifice by offering a substitute sacrifice after his victory in a horse race in Olympia.

Late-Pythagorean philosophers were absorbed into the Platonic school of philosophy and in the 4th century BC the head of the Platonic Academy Polemon included vegetarianism in his concept of living according to nature. In the 1st century AD Ovid identified Pythagoras as the first opponent to meat-eating. But the fuller argument Pythagoreans advanced against the maltreatment of animals did not sustain. Pythagoreans had argued that certain types of food arouse the passions and hindered spiritual ascent. Thus Porphyry would rely on the teachings of the Pythagoreans when arguing that abstinence from eating meat for the purpose of spiritual purification should be practiced only by philosophers, whose aim was to reach a divine state.

==Female philosophers==
The biographical tradition on Pythagoras holds that his mother, wife and daughters were part of his inner circle. Women were given equal opportunity to study as Pythagoreans and learned practical domestic skills in addition to philosophy.

Many of the surviving texts of women Pythagorean philosophers are part of a collection, known as &quot;pseudoepigrapha Pythagorica&quot;, which was compiled by Neopythagoreans in the 1st or 2nd century. Some surviving fragments of this collection are by early-Pythagorean women philosophers, while the bulk of surviving writings are from late-Pythagorean women philosophers who wrote in the 4th and 3rd century BC. Female Pythagoreans are some of the first female philosophers from which texts have survived.

Theano of Croton, the wife of Pythagoras, is considered a major figure in early-Pythagoreanism. She was noted as distinguished philosopher and in the lore that surrounds her, is said to have taken over the leadership of the school after his death. Text fragments have also survived from women philosophers of the late-Pythagorean period. These include Perictione I, Perictione II, Aesara of Lucania and Phintys of Sparta.

Scholars believe that Perictione I was an Athenian and contemporary of Plato, because in &quot;On the Harmony of Woman&quot; she wrote in Ionic and used the same terms of virtues as Plato had done in his &quot;Republic&quot;: &quot;andreia&quot;, &quot;sophrosyne&quot;, &quot;dikaiosyne&quot; and &quot;sophia&quot;. In &quot;On the Harmony of Woman&quot; Perictione I outlines the condition that enable women to nurture wisdom and self-control. These virtues will, according to Perictione I, bring &quot;worthwhile things&quot; for a woman, her husband, her children, the household and even the city &quot;if, at any rate, such a woman should govern cities and tribes&quot;. Her assertion that a wife should remain devoted to her husband, regardless of his behavior, has been interpreted by scholars as a pragmatic response to the legal rights of women in Athens. The woman Pythagorean philosopher Phyntis was Spartan and is believed to have been the daughter of a Spartan admiral killed in the battle of Arginusae in 406 BC. Phyntis authored the treatise &quot;Moderation of Women&quot;, in which she assigned the virtue of moderation to women, but asserted that &quot;courage and justice and wisdom are common to both&quot; men and women. Phyntis defended the right of women to philosophise.

==Influence on Plato and Aristotle ==
Pythagoras&#x27; teachings and Pythagoreanism influenced Plato&#x27;s writings on physical cosmology, psychology, ethics and political philosophy in the 5th century BC. However, Plato adhered to the dominant Greek philosophy, and the Platonic philosophy suppressed the combination of experimental method and mathematics which was an inherent part of Pythagoreanism. The influence of Pythagoreanism extended throughout and beyond antiquity because the Pythagorean doctrine of reincarnation was recounted in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Gorgias&quot;, &quot;Phaedo&quot;, and &quot;Republic&quot;, while the Pythagorean cosmology was discussed in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;. The possible influence of Pythagoreanism on Plato&#x27;s concept of harmony and the Platonic solids has been discussed extensively. Plato&#x27;s dialogues have become an important surviving source of Pythagorean philosophic arguments. Plato referenced Philolaus in &quot;Phaedo&quot; and wrote a Platonic adaptation of Philolaus&#x27; metaphysical system of limiters and unlimiteds. Plato also quoted from one of the surviving Archytas fragments in the &quot;Republic&quot;. However, Plato&#x27;s views that the primary role of mathematics was to turn the soul towards the world of forms, as expressed in &quot;Timaeus&quot;, is regarded as Platonic philosophy, rather than Pythagorean.

Aristotle in the 4th century BC rejected mathematics as a tool for investigation and understanding of the world. He believed that numbers constituted simply a quantitative determinant and had no ontological value. Aristotle&#x27;s discussion of Pythagorean philosophy is difficult to interpret, because he had little patience for Pythagorean philosophic arguments, and Pythagoreanism does not fit with his philosophic doctrine. In &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, Aristotle refuted the Pythagorean doctrine on the harmony of the spheres. Nevertheless, he wrote a treatise on the Pythagoreans of which only fragments survive, in which he treats Pythagoras as a wonder-working religious teacher.

==Neopythagoreanism==

The Neopythagoreans were a school and a religious community. The revival of Pythagoreanism has been attributed to Publius Nigidius Figulus, Eudorus of Alexandria and Arius Didymus. In the 1st century AD Moderatus of Gades and Nicomachus of Gerasa emerged as leading teachers of Neopythagoreanism. The most significant Neopythagorean teacher was Apollonius of Tyana in the 1st century AD, who was regarded as a sage and lived as an ascetic. The last Neopythagorean philosopher was Numenius of Apamea in the 2nd century. Neopythagoreanism remained an elite movement which in the 3rd century merged into Neoplatonism.

Neopythagoreans combined Pythagorean teachings with Platonic, Peripatetic, Aristotelian and Stoic philosophic traditions. Two tendencies within Neopythagorean philosophy emerged, one that owed much to Stoic monism and another that relied on Platonic dualism. Neopythagoreans refined the idea of God and located him beyond the finite so that God could not come into contact with anything corporeal. Neopythagoreans insisted on a spiritual worship of God and that life had to be purified through abstinence.

Neopythagoreans manifested a strong interest in numerology and the superstitious aspects of Pythagoreanism. They combined this with the teachings of Plato&#x27;s philosophic successors. Neopythagorean philosophers engaged in the common ancient practice of ascribing their doctrines to the designated &quot;founder&quot; of their philosophy and by crediting their doctrines to Pythagoras himself, they hoped to gain authority for their views.

==Later influence==
===On early Christianity===
Christianity was influenced by a Christianised form of Platonism, which had been set out in the four books of the &quot;Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum&quot;: &quot;The Celestrial Hierarchy&quot;, &quot;The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy&quot;, &quot;On Divine Names&quot; and &quot;The Mystical Theology&quot;. Having been attributed to Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, the books explained the relationship among celestial beings, humans, God and the universe. At the heart of the explanation were numbers. According to &quot;The Celestrial Hierarchy&quot;, the universe consisted of a threefold division: heaven, earth and hell. Sunlight lit up the universe and was proof of God&#x27;s presence. In the Middle Ages this numerological division of the universe was credited to the Pythagoreans, while early on it was regarded as an authoritative source of Christian doctrine by Photius and John of Sacrobosco. The &quot;Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum&quot; was to be referenced in the late Middle Ages by Dante and in the Renaissance a new translation of it was produced by Marsilio Ficino.

Early Christian theologians, such as Clement of Alexandria, adopted the ascetic doctrines of the neopythagoreans. The moral and ethical teachings of Pythagorean influenced early Christianity and assimilated into early Christian texts. The &quot;Sextou gnomai&quot; (&quot;Sentences of Sextus&quot;), a Hellenistic Pythagorean text modified to reflect a Christian viewpoint, existed from at least the 2nd century and remained popular among Christians well into the Middle Ages. The &quot;Sentences of Sextus&quot; consisted of 451 sayings or principles, such as injunctions to love the truth, to avoid the pollution of the body with pleasure, to shun flatterers and to let one&#x27;s tongue be harnessed by one&#x27;s mind. The contents of the &quot;Sentences of Sextus&quot; was attributed by Iamblichus, the 1st century biographer of Pythagoras, to &quot;Sextus Pythagoricus&quot;. The assertion was repeated subsequently by Saint Jerome. In the 2nd century many of the &quot;Sentences of Sextus&quot; were cited by Plutarch as Pythagorean aphorisms. The &quot;Sentences of Sextus&quot; were translated into Syriac, Latin and Arabic, then the written language of both Muslims and Jews, but only in the Latin world did they become a guide to daily life that was widely circulated.

===On numerology===
1st century treatises of Philo and Nicomachus popularised the mystical and cosmological symbolism Pythagoreans attributed to numbers. This interest in Pythagorean views on the importance of numbers was sustained by mathematicians such as Theon of Smyrna, Anatolius and Iamblichus. These mathematicians relied on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; as their source for Pythagorean philosophy.

In the Middle Ages studies and adaptations of &quot;Timaeus&quot; solidified the view that there was a numerical explanation for proportion and harmony among learned men. Pythagoreanism, as mediated in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;, spurred increasingly detailed studies of symmetry and harmony. Intellectuals pondered how knowledge of the geometry in which God had arranged the universe could be applied to life. By the 12th century Pythagorean numerological concepts had become a universal language in medieval Europe and were no longer recognised as Pythagorean. Writers such as Thierry of Chartres, William of Conches and Alexander Neckham referenced classical writers that had discussed Pythagoreanism, including Cicero, Ovid and Pliny, leading them to believe that mathematics was the key to understanding astronomy and nature. Another important text on Pythagorean numerology was Boethius&#x27;s &quot;De arithmetica&quot;, which was widely reproduced in the West. Boethius had relied on Nicomachus&#x27;s writings as a source of Pythagoreanism.

The 11th-century Byzantine professor of philosophy Michael Psellus popularised Pythagorean numerology in his treatise on theology, arguing that Plato was the inheritor of the Pythagorean secret. Psellus also attributed arithmetical inventions by Diophantus to Pythagoras. Psellus thought to reconstruct Iamblichus&#x27; 10 book encyclopedia on Pythagoreanism from surviving fragments, leading to the popularisation of Iamblichus&#x27; description of Pythagorean physics, ethics and theology at the Byzantine court. Psellus was reputably in the possession of the Hermetica, a set of texts thought to be genuinely antique and which would be prolifically reproduced in the late Middle Ages. Manuel Bryennios introduced Pythagorean numerology to Byzantine music with his treatise &quot;Harmonics&quot;. He argued that the octave was essential in attaining perfect harmony.

In the Jewish communities the development of the Kabbalah as esoteric doctrine became associated with numerology. It was only in the 1st century that Philo of Alexandria, developed a Jewish Pythagoreanism. In the 3rd century Hermippus popularised the belief that Pythagoras had been the basis for establishing key dates in Judaism. In the 4th century this assertion was further developed by Aristobulus. The Jewish Pythagorean numerology developed by Philo held that God as the unique One was the creator of all numbers, of which seven was the most divine and ten the most perfect. The medieval edition of the Kabbalah focused largely on a cosmological scheme of creation, in reference to early Pythagorean philosophers Philolaus and Empedocles and helped to disseminate Jewish Pythagorean numerology.

===On mathematics===
Nicomachus&#x27; treatises were well known in Greek, Latin and the Arabic worlds. In the 9th century an Arabic translation of Nicomachus&#x27; &quot;Introduction to Arithmetic&quot; was published. The Arabic translations of Nicomachus&#x27; treatises were in turn translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona, making them part of the Latin tradition of numerology. The Pythagorean theorem was referenced in Arabic manuscripts. Scholars in the Arabic world displayed a strong interest in Pythagorean concepts. In the 10th century Abu al-Wafa&#x27; Buzjani discussed multiplication and division in a treatise on arithmetic for business administrators in reference to Nicomachus. However, the primary interest of Islamic arithmeticians was in solving practical problems, such as taxation, measurement, the estimation of agricultural values and business applications for the buying and selling of goods. There was little interest for the Pythagorean numerology that developed in the Latin world. The primary arithmetical system used by Islamic mathematicians was based on Hindu arithmetic, which rejected the notion that the relations between numbers and geometrical forms were symbolic.

Besides the enthusiasm that developed in the Latin and Byzantine worlds in the Middle Ages for Pythagorean numerology, the Pythagorean tradition of perfect numbers inspired profound scholarship in mathematics. In the 13th century Leonardo of Pisa, better known as Fibonacci, published the &quot;Libre quadratorum&quot; (&quot;The Book of Squares&quot;). Fibonacci had studied scripts from Egypt, Syria, Greece and Sicily, and was learned in Hindu, Arabic and Greek methodologies. Using the Hindu–Arabic numeral system instead of the Roman numerals, he explored numerology as it had been set forth by Nicomachus. Fibonacci observed that square numbers always arise through the addition of consecutive odd numbers starting with unity. Fibonacci put forward a method of generating sets of three square numbers that satisfied the relationship first attributed to Pythagoras by Vitruvius, that . This equation is now known as the Pythagorean triple.

===In the Middle Ages===
In the Middle Ages, from the 5th until the 15th century, Pythagorean texts remained popular. Late antique writers had produced adaptions of the &quot;Sentences of Sextus&quot; as &quot;The golden verses of Pythagoras&quot;. The &quot;Golden Verses&quot; gained popularity and Christian adaptations of it appeared. These Christian adaptations were adopted by monastic orders, such as Saint Benedict, as authoritative Christian doctrine. In the Latin medieval western world, the &quot;Golden Verses&quot; became a widely reproduced text.

Although the concept of the quadrivium originated with Archytas in the 4th century BC and was a familiar concept among academics in the antiquity, it was attributed as Pythagorean in the 5th century by Proclus. According to Proclus, Pythagoreanism divided all mathematical sciences into four categories: arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy. Boethius developed this theory further, arguing that a fourfold path led to the attainment of knowledge. Arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy went on to become the essential parts of curriculums in medieval schools and universities. In the 12th century Pythagoras was credited by Hugh of Saint Victor with having written a book on quadrivium. The role of harmony had its roots in the triadic thinking of Plato and Aristotle and included the trivium of grammar, rhetoric and dialectic. From the 9th century onwards, both the quadrivium and the trivium were commonly taught in schools and the newly emerging universities. They came to be known as the Seven liberal arts.

In the early 6th century the Roman philosopher Boethius popularised Pythagorean and Platonic conceptions of the universe and expounded the supreme importance of numerical ratios. The 7th century Bishop Isidore of Seville expressed his preference for the Pythagorean vision of a universe governed by the mystical properties of certain numbers, over the newly emerging Euclidean notion that knowledge could be built through deductive proofs. Isidore relied on the arithmetic of Nicomachus, who had fashioned himself as heir of Pythagoras, and took things further by studying the etymology of the name of each number. The 12th century theologian Hugh of Saint Victor found Pythagorean numerology so alluring that he set out to explain the human body entirely in numbers. In the 13th century the fashion for numerology dwindled. The Christian scholar Albertus Magnus rebuked the preoccupation with Pythagorean numerology, arguing that nature could not only be explained in terms of numbers. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; became a popular source on the mystical and cosmological symbolism Pythagoreans attributed to numbers. The preoccupation for finding a numerical explanation for proportion and harmony culminated in the French cathedrals of the 11th, 12th and 13th century.

Arabic translations of the &quot;Golden Verses&quot; were produced in the 11th and 12th centuries. In the Medieval Islamic world a Pythagorean tradition took hold, whereby spheres or stars produced music. This doctrine was further developed by Ikhwan al-Safa and al-Kindi, who pointed to the similarity between the harmony of music and the harmony of the soul. But Islamic philosophers such as al-Farabi and Ibn Sina vehemently rejected this Pythagorean doctrine. in &quot;Kitab al-Musiqa al-Kabir&quot; Al-Farabi rejected the notion of celestial harmony on the grounds that it was &quot;plainly wrong&quot; and that it was not possible for the heavens, orbs and stars to emit sounds through their motions.

The four books of the &quot;Corpus Areopagiticum or Corpus Dionysiacum&quot; (&quot;The Celestrial Hierarchy&quot;, &quot;The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy&quot;, &quot;On Divine Names&quot; and &quot;The Mystical Theology&quot;) by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite became enormously popular during the Middle Ages in the Byzantine world, where they had first been published in the 1st century, but also the Latin world when they were translated in the 9th century. The division of the universe into heaven, earth and hell, and the 12 orders of heaven were credited as Pythagoras&#x27; teachings by an anonymous biographer, who was quoted in the treatise of the 9th century Byzantine patriarch Photius. The 13th century astronomer and mathematician John of Sacrobosco in turn credited Pseudo-Dionysius when discussing the twelve signs of the zodiac.

In the Middle Ages various classical texts that discussed Pythagorean ideas were reproduced and translated. Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; was translated and republished with commentary in the Arab and Jewish worlds. In the 12th century the study of Plato gave rise to a vast body of literature explicating the glory of God as it reflected in the orderliness of the universe. Writers such as Thierry of Chartres, William of Conches and Alexander Neckham referenced not only Plato but also other classical authors that had discussed Pythagoreanism, including Cicero, Ovid and Pliny. William of Conches argued that Plato was an important Pythagorean. In this medieval Pythagorean understanding of Plato, God was a craftsman when he designed the universe.

===On Western science===
In the preface of &quot;De revolutionibus&quot;, Copernicus cites three pythagorean philosophers as precursors of the Heliocentric Theory: Hicetas, Philolaus and Ecphantus.

:At first I found in Cicero that Hicetas supposed the earth to move. Later I also discovered in Plutarch that others were of this opinion. I have decided to set his words down here, so that they may be available to everybody: &quot;Some think that the earth remains at rest. But Philolaus the Pythagorean believes that, like the sun and moon, it revolves around the fire in an oblique circle. Heraclides of Pontus and Ecphantus the Pythagorean make the earth move, not in a progressive motion, but like a wheel in a rotation from west to east about its own center.&quot;

In the 16th century Vincenzo Galilei challenged the prevailing Pythagorean wisdom about the relationship between pitches and weights attached to strings. Vincenzo Galilei, the father of Galileo Galilei, engaged in an extended public exchange with his former teacher Zarlino. Zarlino supported the theory that if two weights in the ratio of 2 to 1 were attached to two strings, the pitches generated by the two strings would produce the octave. Vincenzo Galilei proclaimed that he had been a committed Pythagorean, until he &quot;ascertained the truth by means of experiment, the teacher of all things&quot;. He devised an experiment which showed that the weights attached to the two strings needed to increase as the square of the string length. This public challenge to prevailing numerology in musical theory triggered an experimental and physical approach to acoustics in the 17th century. Acoustics emerged as a mathematical field of music theory and later an independent branch of physics. In the experimental investigation of sound phenomena, numbers had no symbolic meaning and were merely used to measure physical phenomena and relationships such as frequency and vibration of a string.

Many of the most eminent 17th century natural philosophers in Europe, including Francis Bacon, Descartes, Beeckman, Kepler, Mersenne, Stevin and Galileo, had a keen interest in music and acoustics. By the late 17th century it was accepted that sound travels like a wave in the air at a finite speed and experiments to establish the speed of sound were carried out by philosophers attached to the French Academy of Sciences, the Accademia del Cimento and the Royal Society.

At the height of the Scientific Revolution, as Aristotelianism declined in Europe, the ideas of early-Pythagoreanism were revived. Mathematics regained importance and influenced philosophy as well as science. Mathematics was used by Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Huygens and Newton to advance physical laws that reflected the inherent order of the universe. Twenty-one centuries after Pythagoreas had taught his disciples in Italy, Galileo announced to the world that &quot;the great book of nature&quot; could only be read by those who understood the language of mathematics. He set out to measure whatever is measurable, and to render everything measurable that is not. The Pythagorean concept of cosmic harmony deeply influenced western science. It served as the basis for Kepler&#x27;s &quot;harmonices mundi&quot; and Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;pre-established harmony&quot;. Albert Einstein believed that through this &quot;pre-established harmony&quot;, the productive unison between the spiritual and material world was possible.

The Pythagorean belief that all bodies are composed of numbers and that all properties and causes could be expressed in numbers, served as the basis for a mathematization of science. This mathematization of the physical reality climaxed in the 20th century. The pioneer of physics Werner Heisenberg argued that &quot;this mode of observing nature, which led in part to a true dominion over natural forces and thus contributes decisively to the development of humanity, in an unforeseen manner vindicated the Pythagorean faith&quot;.

<text>Alexander Arthur Alfonso David Maule Ramsay of Mar, DL (21 December 1919 – 20 December 2000) was the only child of Princess Patricia of Connaught, who renounced her royal title and style when she married then-Captain the Hon. Alexander Ramsay in February 1919. His mother was the youngest child of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, the third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. His father was the third son of John Ramsay, 13th Earl of Dalhousie. Through the marriage of his maternal aunt, Princess Margaret of Connaught, to the Swedish prince who later became King Gustav VI Adolf of Sweden, his first cousins included Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, whose son later became King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden; and Princess Ingrid of Sweden, who later became Queen of Denmark after marrying the Danish prince who later became King Frederik IX of Denmark. 

==Biography==
Alexander Arthur Alfonso David Maule Ramsay was born on 21 December 1919 in his mother&#x27;s bathroom at Clarence House, then the London residence of his maternal grandfather, the Duke of Connaught. His baptism was held on 23 February 1920 at the Chapel Royal at St James&#x27;s Palace and attended by King George V and Queens Mary and Alexandra; Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll; and Princess Victoria. His godparents were the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), King Alfonso XIII of Spain, the Princess Royal, Princess Christian, Princess Helena Victoria, and Commander Bolton Eyres-Monsell.

He, along with his cousin Viscount Lascelles, acted as a page of honour during the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. After leaving Eton College the same year, he received a commission in the Grenadier Guards. Ramsay saw active service in North Africa during the Second World War. He lost his right leg during a tank battle in Tunisia in 1943. In 1944, he joined the staff of his second cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, who was then Governor-General of Australia.

Upon returning to Britain in 1947, he was informed that he would inherit Mar Lodge and its estates from his aunt, Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife. In preparation for this role, he read agriculture at Trinity College, Oxford. After graduating in 1952, he worked for three years as assistant factor on the Linlithgow estates at South Queensferry. Ramsay inherited the Mar estate, becoming the new Laird of Mar, in 1959. At that point, Lord Lyon King of Arms allowed him to add the designation &quot;of Mar&quot; to his name. Part of the estate had to be sold to pay inheritance tax and became Mar Lodge Estate.

In 1956, Ramsay married Flora Fraser (18 October 1930 – 3 September 2024), the only daughter of Alexander Fraser, 20th Lord Saltoun, and chief of the Name of Fraser. His wife succeeded her father as the 21st Lady Saltoun and chief of the Name of Fraser in 1979. Thereafter, they resided at his wife&#x27;s family seat, Cairnbulg Castle at Fraserburgh, in Aberdeenshire. In 1971, he became the deputy lord lieutenant for Aberdeenshire.

Although the Ramsays of Mar had no royal titles and carried out no public duties, they attended most major royal events, and were the heads of many Scottish Feudal Baronies, including MacDuff, named for James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife. Alexander Ramsay of Mar died at his estate after a short illness, on the eve of his 81st birthday.

==Family==
Captain Alexander Ramsay of Mar and Lady Saltoun had three daughters:

* Katherine Ingrid Mary Isabel Fraser, 22nd Lady Saltoun (born 11 October 1957)
* Hon. Alice Elizabeth Margaret Ramsay of Mar (born 8 July 1961, Edinburgh). She married David Ramsey on 28 July 1990. They have four children:
**Alexander Ramsey (b. 1991)
**Victoria Ramsey (b. 1994)
**George Ramsey (b. 28 September 1995)
**Oliver Ramsey (b. 28 September 1995)
* Hon. Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Ramsay of Mar (born 15 April 1963, Inverness)

<doc id="291174" wikidata="Q952774" url="?curid=291174" title="Invasion of Quebec (1775)">
<text>The Invasion of Quebec (June 1775 – October 1776, ) was the first major military initiative by the newly formed Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The objective of the campaign was to seize the Province of Quebec (part of modern-day Canada) from Great Britain, and persuade French-speaking to join the revolution on the side of the Thirteen Colonies. One expedition left Fort Ticonderoga under Richard Montgomery, besieged and captured Fort Saint-Jean, and very nearly captured British General Guy Carleton when taking Montreal. The other expedition, under Benedict Arnold, left Cambridge, Massachusetts, and traveled with great difficulty through the wilderness of Maine to Quebec City. The two forces joined there, but they were defeated at the Battle of Quebec in December 1775.

Montgomery&#x27;s expedition set out from Fort Ticonderoga in late August, and in mid-September began besieging Fort St. Johns, the main defensive point south of Montreal. After the fort was captured in November, Carleton abandoned Montreal, fleeing to Quebec City, and Montgomery took control of Montreal before heading for Quebec with an army much reduced in size by expiring enlistments. There he joined Arnold, who had left Cambridge in early September on an arduous trek through the wilderness that left his surviving troops starving and lacking in many supplies and equipment.

These forces joined before Quebec City in December, and they assaulted the city in a snowstorm on the last day of the year. The battle was a disastrous defeat for the Continental Army; Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded, while the city&#x27;s defenders suffered few casualties. Arnold then conducted an ineffectual siege on the city, during which successful propaganda campaigns boosted Loyalist sentiments, and General David Wooster&#x27;s blunt administration of Montreal served to annoy both supporters and detractors of the Americans.

The British sent several thousand troops under General John Burgoyne, including Hessian auxiliaries, to reinforce the province in May 1776. General Carleton then launched a counter-offensive, ultimately driving the smallpox-weakened and disorganized Continental forces back to Fort Ticonderoga. The Continental Army, under Arnold&#x27;s command, hindered the British advance sufficiently that an attack could not be mounted on Fort Ticonderoga in 1776. The end of the campaign set the stage for Burgoyne&#x27;s 1777 campaign in the Hudson River valley.

==Naming==
The objective of the American military campaign, control of the British province of Quebec, was frequently referred to as &quot;Canada&quot; in 1775. For example, the authorization by the Second Continental Congress to General Philip Schuyler for the campaign included language that, if it was &quot;not disagreeable to the Canadians&quot;, to &quot;immediately take possession of St. John&#x27;s, Montreal, and any other parts of the Country&quot;, and to &quot;pursue any other measures in Canada&quot; that might &quot;promote peace and security&quot; of the colonies. Even relatively modern history books covering the campaign in detail refer to it as Canada in their titles (see references). The territory that Britain called Quebec was in large part French Canada until 1763, when France ceded it to Britain in the Treaty of Paris (1763), which formally ended the French and Indian War. (French leaders had surrendered the province to the British military in 1760.) The name &quot;Quebec&quot; is used in this article, except in quotations that specifically mention &quot;Canada&quot;, to avoid confusion between this historic usage, and usage with respect to the modern nation of Canada.

==Background==
In the spring of 1775, the American Revolutionary War began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The conflict was then at a standstill, with the British Army surrounded by colonial militia in the Siege of Boston. In May 1775, aware of the light defenses and presence of heavy weapons at the British Fort Ticonderoga, Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen led a force of colonial militia that captured Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point, and raided Fort St. Johns, all of which were only lightly defended at the time. Ticonderoga and Crown Point were garrisoned by 1,000 Connecticut militia under the command of Benjamin Hinman in June.

===Congressional authorization===
The First Continental Congress, meeting in 1774, had previously invited the French-Canadians to join in a second meeting of the Congress to be held in May 1775, in a public letter dated October 26, 1774. The Second Continental Congress sent a second such letter in May 1775, but there was no substantive response to either one.

Following the capture of Ticonderoga, Arnold and Allen noted that it was necessary to hold Ticonderoga as a defense against attempts by the British to militarily divide the colonies, and also noted that Quebec was poorly defended. They each separately proposed expeditions against Quebec, suggesting that a force as small as 1200–1500 men would be sufficient to drive the British military from the province. Congress at first ordered the forts to be abandoned, prompting New York and Connecticut to provide troops and material for purposes that were essentially defensive in nature. Public outcries from across New England and New York challenged the Congress to change its position. When it became clear that Guy Carleton, the governor of Quebec, was fortifying Fort St. Johns, and was also attempting to involve the Iroquois in upstate New York in the conflict, Congress decided that a more active position was needed. On June 27, 1775, Congress authorized General Philip Schuyler to investigate, and, if it seemed appropriate, begin an invasion. Benedict Arnold, passed over for its command, went to Boston and convinced General George Washington to send a supporting force to Quebec City under his command.

===Defensive preparations===
Following the raid on Fort St. Johns, General Carleton was keenly aware of the danger of invasion from the south, and requested, without immediate relief, reinforcements from General Thomas Gage in Boston. He set about raising local militias to aid in the defense of Montreal and Quebec City, which met with only limited success. In response to the capture of Ticonderoga and the raid on Fort St. Johns, he sent 700 troops to hold that fort on the Richelieu River south of Montreal, ordered construction of vessels for use on Lake Champlain, and recruited about one hundred Mohawk to assist in its defense. He himself oversaw the defense of Montreal, leading only 150 regulars, since he relied on Fort St. Johns for the main defense. The defense of Quebec City he left under the command of Lieutenant-Governor Cramahé.

===Negotiations for Indian support===
Guy Johnson, a Loyalist and British Indian agent living in the Mohawk Valley in New York, was on quite friendly terms with the Iroquois of New York, and was concerned for the safety of himself and his family after it became clear that Patriot sentiment had taken hold in New York. Apparently convinced that he could no longer safely conduct Crown business, he left his estate in New York with about 200 Loyalist and Mohawk supporters. He first went to Fort Ontario, where, on June 17, he extracted from indigenous tribal leaders (mostly Iroquois and Huron) promises to assist in keeping supply and communication lines open in the area, and to support the British in &quot;the annoyance of the enemy&quot;. From there he went to Montreal, where, in a meeting with General Carleton and more than 1,500 indigenous peoples, negotiated similar agreements, and delivered war belts &quot;to be held ready for service&quot;. However, most of those involved in these agreements were Mohawks; the other tribes in the Iroquois Confederacy largely avoided these conferences, seeking to stay neutral. Many of the Mohawks remained in the Montreal area after the conference; however, when it seemed uncertain whether the Americans would actually launch an invasion in 1775, most of them had returned home by the middle of August.

The Continental Congress sought to keep the Six Nations out of the war. In July 1775, Samuel Kirkland, a missionary who was influential with the Oneidas, brought to them a statement from Congress: &quot;we desire you to remain at home, and not join either side, but to keep the hatchet buried deep.&quot; While the Oneidas and Tuscaroras remained formally neutral, many individual Oneidas expressed sympathy with the rebels. News of Johnson&#x27;s Montreal meeting prompted General Schuyler, who also had influence with the Oneidas, to call for a conference in Albany, to be held in mid-August. Attended by about 400 indigenous (primarily Oneidas and Tuscaroras, and only a few Mohawk), Schuyler and other Indian commissioners explained the issues dividing the colonies from Britain, emphasizing that the colonists were at war to preserve their rights, and were not attempting conquest. The assembled chiefs agreed to remain neutral, with one Mohawk chief saying, &quot;It is a family affair&quot; and that they would &quot;sit still and see you fight ... out&quot;. They did, however, extract concessions from the Americans, including promises to address ongoing grievances like the encroachment of white settlers on their lands.

==Montgomery&#x27;s expedition==

The primary thrust of the invasion was to be led by General Schuyler, going up Lake Champlain to assault Montreal and then Quebec City. The expedition was to be composed of forces from New York, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, as well as the Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, with provisions supplied by New York. However, Schuyler was overcautious, and by mid-August the colonists were receiving reports that General Carleton was fortifying defensive positions outside Montreal, and that some Native tribes had joined with the British.

===Approach to St. Johns===
On August 25, while Schuyler was at the indigenous peoples conference, Montgomery received word that ships under construction at Fort St. Johns were nearing completion. Montgomery, taking advantage of Schuyler&#x27;s absence (and in the absence of orders authorizing movement), led 1,200 troops that had mustered at Ticonderoga up to a forward position at Île aux Noix in the Richelieu River, arriving September 4. Schuyler, who was falling ill, caught up with the troops en route. He dispatched a letter to James Livingston, a Canadian prepared to raise local militia forces in support of the American effort, to circulate in the area south of Montreal. The next day, the forces went down the river to Fort St. Johns, where, after seeing the defenses and a brief skirmish in which both sides suffered casualties, they withdrew to Île aux Noix. The skirmish, which involved mostly indigenous people on the British side, was not supported from the fort, prompting the Indians to withdraw from the conflict. Any additional indigenous support for the British was further halted by the timely arrival of Oneidas in the area, who intercepted a Mohawk war party on the move from Caughnawaga toward St. John&#x27;s. The Oneidas convinced the party to return to their village, where Guy Johnson, Daniel Claus, and Joseph Brant had arrived in an attempt to gain the Mohawks&#x27; assistance. Refusing to meet directly with Johnson and Claus, the Oneidas explained to Brant and the Mohawks the terms of the Albany agreement. Brant and the British agents left without any promises of support. (In a more formal snub of the British, the war belt that Guy Johnson gave to the Iroquois in July was turned over to the American Indian commissioners in December 1775.)

Following this first skirmish, General Schuyler became too ill to continue, so he turned command over to Montgomery. Schuyler left for Fort Ticonderoga several days later. After another false start, and the arrival of another 800–1000 men from Connecticut, New Hampshire, and New York, as well as some of the Green Mountain Boys, Montgomery finally began besieging Fort St. Jean on September 17, cutting off its communications with Montreal and capturing supplies intended for the fort. Ethan Allen was captured the following week in the Battle of Longue-Pointe, when, overstepping instructions to merely raise local militia, he attempted to take Montreal with a small force of men. This event resulted in a brief upturn in militia support for the British; but the effects were relatively short-lived, with many deserting again in the following days. After an attempt by General Carleton to relieve the siege failed on October 30, the fort finally surrendered on November 3.

==Occupation of Montreal begins==
Montgomery then led his troops north and occupied Saint Paul&#x27;s Island in the Saint Lawrence River on November 8, crossing to Pointe-Saint-Charles on the following day, where he was greeted as a liberator. Montreal fell without any significant fighting on November 13, as Carleton, deciding that the city was indefensible (and having suffered significant militia desertion upon the news of the fall of St. Johns), withdrew. He barely escaped capture, as some Americans had crossed the river downstream of the city, and winds prevented his fleet from departing right away. When his fleet neared Sorel, it was approached by a boat carrying a truce flag. The boat carried a demand for surrender, claiming that gun batteries downstream would otherwise destroy the convoy. Based on uncertain knowledge of how real these batteries were, Carleton elected to sneak off the ship, after ordering the dumping of powder and ammunition if surrender was deemed necessary. (There were batteries in place, but not nearly as powerful as those claimed.) On November 19, the British fleet surrendered; Carleton, disguised as a common man, made his way to Quebec City. The captured ships included prisoners that the British had taken; among these was Moses Hazen, a Massachusetts-born expatriate with property near Fort St. Jean whose poor treatment by the British turned him against them. Hazen, who had combat experience in the French and Indian War and went on to lead the 2nd Canadian Regiment throughout the war, joined Montgomery&#x27;s army.

Before departing Montreal for Quebec City, Montgomery published messages to the inhabitants that the Congress wanted Quebec to join them, and entered into discussions with American sympathizers with the aim of holding a provincial convention for the purpose of electing delegates to Congress. He also wrote to General Schuyler, requesting that a Congressional delegation be sent to take up diplomatic activities.

Much of Montgomery&#x27;s army departed due to expiring enlistments after the fall of Montreal. He then used some of the captured boats to move towards Quebec City with about 300 troops on November 28, leaving about 200 in Montreal under the command of General David Wooster. Along the way, he picked up James Livingston&#x27;s newly created 1st Canadian Regiment of about 200 men.

==Arnold&#x27;s expedition==
Benedict Arnold, who had been rejected for leadership of the Champlain Valley expedition, returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and approached George Washington with the idea of a supporting eastern invasion force aimed at Quebec City. Washington approved the idea, and gave Arnold 1,100 men, including Daniel Morgan&#x27;s riflemen, for the effort. Arnold&#x27;s force sailed from Newburyport, Massachusetts to the mouth of the Kennebec River and then upriver to Fort Western (present day Augusta, Maine).

Arnold&#x27;s expedition was a success in that he was able to bring a body of troops to the gates of Quebec City. However, the expedition was beset by troubles as soon as it left the last significant outposts of civilization in present-day Maine. There were numerous difficult portages as the troops moved up the Kennebec River, and the boats they were using frequently leaked, spoiling gunpowder and food supplies. The height of land between the Kennebec and the Chaudière River was a swampy tangle of lakes and streams, where the traversal was complicated by bad weather, resulting in one quarter of the troops turning back. The descent down the Chaudière resulted in the destruction of more boats and supplies as the inexperienced troops were unable to control the boats in the fast-moving waters.

By the time Arnold reached the outskirts of civilization along the Saint Lawrence River in November, his force was reduced to 600 starving men. They had traveled almost 400 miles through untracked wilderness. When Arnold and his troops finally reached the Plains of Abraham on November 14, Arnold sent a negotiator with a white flag to demand their surrender, but to no avail. The Americans, with no cannons, and barely fit for action, faced a fortified city. Arnold, after hearing of a planned sortie from the city, decided on November 19 to withdraw to Pointe-aux-Trembles to wait for Montgomery, who had recently captured Montreal. As he headed upriver, Carleton returned to Quebec by river following his defeat at Montreal.

On December 2, Montgomery finally came down the river from Montreal with 500 troops, bringing captured British supplies and winter clothing. The two forces united, and plans were made for an attack on the city. Three days later the Continental Army again stood on the Plains of Abraham and began to besiege the city of Quebec.

==Battle and siege of Quebec==

While planning the attack on the city, Christophe Pélissier, a Frenchman living near Trois-Rivières, came to meet with Montgomery. Pélissier, who was politically supportive of the American cause, operated an ironworks at Saint-Maurice. Montgomery discussed the idea of holding the provincial convention with him. Pélissier recommended against holding a convention until after Quebec City had been taken, as the habitants would not feel free to act in that way until their security was better assured. The two did agree to have Pélissier&#x27;s ironworks provide munitions for the siege, which he did until the Americans retreated in May 1776 (at which time Pélissier also fled, eventually returning to France).

Montgomery joined Arnold and James Livingston in an assault on Quebec City during a snowstorm on December 31, 1775. Outnumbered and lacking any sort of tactical advantage, the Americans were soundly defeated by Carleton. Montgomery was killed, Arnold was wounded, and many men were taken prisoner, including Daniel Morgan. Following the battle, Arnold sent Moses Hazen and Edward Antill, another expatriate American, to report the defeat and request support to Wooster in Montreal, and also to the Congress in Philadelphia.

Carleton chose not to pursue the Americans, opting instead to stay within the fortifications of the city, and await reinforcements that might be expected to arrive when the river thawed in the spring. Arnold maintained a somewhat ineffectual siege over the city, until March 1776, when he was ordered to Montreal and replaced by General Wooster. During these months, the besieging army suffered from difficult winter conditions, and smallpox began to travel more significantly through the camp. These losses were offset by the arrival each month of small companies of reinforcements. On March 14, Jean-Baptiste Chasseur, a miller living downstream from the city, entered Quebec and informed Carleton that there were 200 men on the south side of the river ready to act against the Americans. These men and more were mobilized, but an advance force was defeated in the Battle of Saint-Pierre by a detachment of pro-American local militia that were stationed on the south side of the river.

Congress, even before it learned of the defeat at Quebec, had authorized as many as 6,500 additional troops for service there. Throughout the winter, troops trickled into Montreal and the camp outside Quebec City. By the end of March, the besieging army had grown to almost 3,000, although almost one quarter of these were unfit for service, mainly due to smallpox. An American veteran of the invasion, John Joseph Henry, later recalled that American troops inoculated themselves against smallpox during the campaign &quot;by laceration under the finger nails by means of pins or needles.&quot; This practice continued ever after military officials attempted to prohibit it, as it was reducing the invasion force&#x27;s combat efficiency. Furthermore, James Livingston and Moses Hazen, commanding the 500 Canadians in the army, were pessimistic about the loyalty of their men and the cooperation of the population due to persistent Loyalist propaganda.

Congress was conflicted about requests that Arnold made for a more experienced general officer to lead the siege effort. They first chose Charles Lee, a major general with experience in the British Army, to lead the troops in Quebec in January. One week later, they retracted the step, and instead sent Lee into the southern states to direct efforts against an anticipated British attack there. (The British attempt was thwarted in the June 1776 Battle of Sullivan&#x27;s Island.) They finally settled in March 1776 on Major General John Thomas, who had served in the army besieging Boston.

==Discontent in Montreal==

When General Montgomery left Montreal for Quebec City, he left the administration of the city in the hands of Connecticut&#x27;s Brigadier General David Wooster. While Wooster at first had decent relations with the community, he took a number of steps that caused the local population to come to dislike the American military presence. After promising American ideals to the population, he began arresting Loyalists and threatening arrest and punishment of anyone opposed to the American cause. He also disarmed several communities, and attempted to force local militia members to surrender their Crown commissions. Those who refused were arrested and imprisoned at Fort Chambly. These and similar acts, combined with the fact that the Americans were paying for supplies and services with paper money rather than coin, served to disillusion the local population about the entire American enterprise. On March 20, Wooster left to take command of the forces at Quebec City, leaving Moses Hazen, who had raised the 2nd Canadian Regiment, in command of Montreal until Arnold arrived on April 19.

On April 29, a delegation consisting of three members of the Continental Congress, along with an American Jesuit priest, John Carroll (later the first Catholic bishop in the United States) and a French printer from Philadelphia, arrived in Montreal. The Continental Congress had assigned this delegation the tasks of assessing the situation in Quebec and attempting to sway public opinion to their cause. This delegation, which included Benjamin Franklin, was largely unsuccessful in its efforts, as relations were already significantly damaged. The delegation had not brought any hard currency to alleviate debts to the population that were accumulating. Efforts to turn the Catholic clergy to their cause failed, as the local priests pointed out that the Quebec Act passed by the British Parliament had given them what they wanted. Fleury Mesplet, the printer, while he had set up his press, did not have time to produce anything before events began to overtake the delegation. Franklin and Carroll left Montreal on May 11, following news that the American forces at Quebec City were in panicked retreat, to return to Philadelphia. Samuel Chase and Charles Carroll, the other two delegates, analyzed the military situation in the area south and east of Montreal, finding it a good place to set up a defense. On May 27, they wrote a report to Congress on the situation, and left for the south.

===The Cedars===
Upriver from Montreal were a series of small British garrisons that the Americans had not concerned themselves with during the occupation. As spring approached, bands of Cayuga, Seneca, and Mississauga warriors began to gather at Oswegatchie, one of these garrisons, giving the commander there, Captain George Forster, a force with which to cause trouble for the Americans. Forster had recruited them on the recommendation of a Loyalist who had escaped from Montreal. Furthermore, while General Wooster, much to the annoyance of both Patriot and Loyalist merchants, had refused to permit trade with the Indians upriver out of fear that supplies sent in that direction would be used by the British forces there, the congressional delegation reversed his decision and supplies began flowing out of the city up the river.

To prevent the flow of supplies to the British forces upriver, and in response to rumours of indigenous peoples gathering, Moses Hazen detached Colonel Timothy Bedel and 390 men to a position upriver at Les Cèdres (English: &quot;The Cedars&quot;), where they built a stockaded defense works. Colonel Forster was made aware of these movements by Indian spies and Loyalists, and on May 15 began to move downriver with a mixed force of about 250 Natives, militia, and regulars. In an odd series of encounters known as the Battle of the Cedars, Bedel&#x27;s lieutenant Isaac Butterfield surrendered this entire force without a fight on the 18th, and another 100 men brought as reinforcements also surrendered after a brief skirmish on the 19th.

===Quinze-Chênes===
On receiving news of Butterfield&#x27;s capture, Arnold immediately began assembling a force to recover them, which he entrenched in a position at Lachine, just upriver from Montreal. Forster, who had left the captives in the stockade at Les Cèdres, moved closer to Montreal with a force now numbering around 500, until May 24 when he received intelligence of Arnold&#x27;s location, and that Arnold was expecting additional forces which would significantly outnumber his. Since his force was dwindling in size, he negotiated an agreement with his captives to exchange them for British prisoners taken during the Siege of Fort St. Jean. After a brief exchange of cannon fire at Quinze-Chênes, Arnold also agreed to the exchange, which took place between May 27 and 30.

==Reinforcements arrive at Quebec City==
===American troops===
General John Thomas was unable to move north until late April, due to the icy conditions on Lake Champlain. Concerned about reports of troop readiness and sickness, he made requests to Washington for additional men to follow him while he waited for conditions to improve. Upon his arrival in Montreal, he learned that many men had promised to stay only until April 15, and most of these were insistent on returning home. This was compounded by relatively low enrollments in regiments actually raised for service in Quebec. One regiment with an authorized strength of 750, sailed north with but 75 men. These deficiencies prompted Congress to order Washington to send more troops north. In late April, Washington ordered ten regiments, led by Generals William Thompson and John Sullivan, to go north from New York. This significantly reduced Washington&#x27;s forces that were preparing for a British attack there. This also exposed transport problems: there were insufficient sailing hands on Lakes George and Champlain to easily move all of these men. Furthermore, there was also a shortage of supplies in Quebec, and much of the shipping was needed to move provisions instead of men. As a result, Sullivan&#x27;s men were held up at Ticonderoga, and Sullivan did not reach Sorel until the beginning of June.

General Wooster arrived in the American camp outside Quebec City in early April with reinforcements. Reinforcements continued to arrive from the south in modest numbers, until General Thomas arrived at the end of April and assumed command of a force that was nominally over 2,000 strong, but in reality was significantly diminished by the effects of smallpox and the hardships of the Canadian winter. Rumors began circulating on May 2 that British ships were coming up the river. Thomas decided on May 5 to evacuate the sick to Trois-Rivières, with the rest of the forces to withdraw as soon as practical. Late on that day he received intelligence that 15 ships were 40 leagues below the city, awaiting favorable conditions to come up the river. The pace of camp evacuation took on a sense of urgency early the next day when ship&#x27;s masts were spotted; the wind had changed, and 3 ships of the fleet had reached the city.

===British troops===
After news of Lexington and Concord reached London, the government of Lord North, realizing it would require the support of foreign troops to combat the rebellion, began negotiating with European allies for the use of their troops in North America. Requests to Catherine the Great for Russian troops were refused, but a number of German principalities were prepared to offer theirs. Of the 50,000 troops that Britain raised in 1776, nearly one third came from a handful of these principalities; the number of troops from Hesse-Cassel and Hesse-Hanau caused them to be widely referred to as Hessians. Of these 50,000, about 11,000 were destined for service in Quebec. Troops from Hesse-Hanau and Brunswick-Lüneburg sailed in February 1776 for Cork, where they joined a convoy carrying British troops that sailed in early April.

Carleton, having been informed of pace of activity in the American camp, rapidly unloaded reinforcements from the arrived ships, and around noon marched with a force of about 900 troops to test the Americans. The American response was essentially panic; a disorganized retreat began that might have ended even more disastrously for the Americans had Carleton pressed his advantage. Hoping to win over the rebels with a lenient attitude, he was content to send ships up the river to harass the Americans, and to possibly cut them off. He also captured a number of Americans, mostly sick and wounded, but also a detachment of troops that had been abandoned on the south side of the St. Lawrence. The Americans, in their hurry to get away, left numerous valuable military effects, including cannon and gunpowder, in their wake. They regrouped on the 7th at Deschambault, about 40 miles upriver from Quebec City. Thomas held a war council there, in which most of the leadership favored retreat. Thomas opted to retain 500 men at Deschambault while sending the rest to Sorel, and also sent word to Montreal for assistance, since many of the troops had little more than the clothes on their backs and a few days rations.

The Congressional delegation in Montreal, upon hearing this news, determined that holding the Saint Lawrence would no longer be possible, and dispatched only a small number of troops toward Deschambault. Thomas, after waiting for six days for word from Montreal and hearing none, began to withdraw toward Trois-Rivières, but not before having to fight off skirmishers from forces landed from British ships on the river. They reached Trois-Rivières on May 15, where they left the sick, and a detachment of New Jersey troops to defend them. By the 18th, the remaining troops joined reinforcements under General Thompson at Sorel, where on the 21st, a council was held with the Congressional delegates. Thomas contracted smallpox that same day, and died on June 2. He was replaced by Thompson.

==Carleton&#x27;s counteroffensive==


===Trois-Rivières===
On May 6, 1776, a small squadron of British ships under Captain Charles Douglas had arrived to relieve Quebec with supplies and 3,000 troops, precipitating the Americans&#x27; retreat to Sorel. However, General Carleton did not take significant offensive measures until May 22, when he sailed to Trois-Rivières with the 47th and 29th regiments. While hearing news of Forster&#x27;s success at Les Cèdres, instead of pushing ahead he returned to Quebec City, leaving Allen Maclean in command at Trois-Rivières. There he met Lieutenant General John Burgoyne, who had arrived on June 1 with a large force of mostly Irish recruits, Hessian allies, and a war chest of money.

The Americans at Sorel, on receiving word that a force of &quot;only 300 men&quot; was at Trois-Rivières, thought that they should be able to send a force from Sorel to take Trois-Rivières back. Unaware that major British reinforcements had arrived, and ignorant of the geography around the town, General Thompson led 2,000 men first into a swamp, and then into the teeth of a reinforced, entrenched British army. This disaster included the capture of Thompson and many of his senior officers, as well as 200 men and most of the ships used for the expedition, and forecast the end of the American occupation of Quebec. The American forces at Sorel, now under the command of General Sullivan, retreated. Carleton once again did not press his advantage, even going so far as to eventually return the captives to New York, in great comfort, in August.

===Retreat to Crown Point===
Early on June 14, Carleton finally sailed his army up the river to Sorel. Arriving late in the day, they discovered that the Americans had abandoned Sorel just that morning, and were retreating up the Richelieu River valley toward Chambly and St. Johns. Unlike the departure from Quebec City, the Americans left in a somewhat orderly manner, although some units were separated from the main force by the arrival of Carleton&#x27;s fleet, and were forced to march to Montreal to join Arnold&#x27;s forces. Carleton directed General Burgoyne and 4,000 troops to move up the Richelieu after the retreating Americans, while Carleton continued sailing toward Montreal.

In Montreal, Arnold was ignorant of the events taking place downriver, having recently finished dealing with Forster. A messenger he sent downriver toward Sorel on June 15 for news from General Sullivan spotted Carleton&#x27;s fleet, escaped to shore, and returned with the news to Montreal on a stolen horse. Within four hours, Arnold and the American forces garrisoned around Montreal had abandoned the city (but not before trying to burn it down), leaving it in the hands of the local militia. Carleton&#x27;s fleet arrived in Montreal on June 17.

Arnold&#x27;s troops caught up with the main army near St. Jean on the 17th. Sullivan&#x27;s army was in no condition to fight, and after a brief council, the decision was made to retreat to Crown Point. The army reportedly got away from St. Jean almost literally moments before the vanguard of Burgoyne&#x27;s army arrived on the scene.

The remains of the American army arrived at Crown Point in early July, ending a campaign that was described as &quot;a heterogeneal concatenation of the most peculiar and unparalleled rebuffs and sufferings that are perhaps to be found in the annals of any nation&quot;, by Isaac Senter, a doctor who experienced much of the campaign. Unfortunately for the Americans, the campaign was not quite ended, since the British were still on the move.

===Shipbuilding and politics===
The Americans had been careful at every step of the retreat up the Richelieu and across Lake Champlain to deny the British of any significant shipping, burning or sinking any boats they did not take with them. This forced the British to spend several months building ships. Carleton reported to London on September 28 that &quot;I expect our Fleet will soon sail with hopes of success should they come to action&quot;. General Arnold, when he and Ethan Allen captured Fort Ticonderoga, had established a small navy that was still patrolling Lake Champlain.

While the British assembled a navy to counteract Arnold&#x27;s, Carleton dealt with matters in Montreal. Even before the Americans retreated from Quebec City, he formed committees to look into the roles played by local Patriot sympathizers, sending them out into the countryside to arrest active participants in the American action, including those who had detained Loyalists. When he arrived in Montreal, similar commissions were set up.

===Valcour Island===
General Horatio Gates was given command of the Continental Army&#x27;s northern forces in early July. He promptly moved the bulk of the army to Ticonderoga, leaving a force of about 300 at Crown Point. The army was busied improving the defenses at Ticonderoga, while Arnold was given the task of building up the American fleet at Crown Point. Throughout the summer, reinforcements poured into Ticonderoga, until the army was estimated to be 10,000 strong. A smaller army of shipwrights labored at Skenesborough (present-day Whitehall) to build the ships needed to defend the lake.

Carleton began to move on October 7. By October 9, the British fleet was on Lake Champlain. In a naval action between Valcour Island and the western shore, beginning on October 11, the British inflicted heavy damage to Arnold&#x27;s fleet, forcing him to withdraw to Crown Point. Feeling that Crown Point would be inadequate protection against a sustained British attack, he then withdrew to Ticonderoga. British forces occupied Crown Point on October 17.

Carleton&#x27;s troops remained at Crown Point for two weeks, with some troops advancing to within three miles of Ticonderoga, apparently in an attempt to draw Gates&#x27; army out. On November 2, they pulled out of Crown Point and withdrew to winter quarters in Quebec.

==Aftermath==
The invasion of Quebec ended as a disaster for the Americans, but Arnold&#x27;s actions on the retreat from Quebec and his improvised navy on Lake Champlain were widely credited with delaying a full-scale British counter thrust until 1777. Numerous factors were put forward as reasons for the invasion&#x27;s failure, including the high rate of smallpox among American troops. Carleton was heavily criticized by Burgoyne for not pursuing the American retreat from Quebec more aggressively. Due to these criticisms and the fact that Carleton was disliked by Lord George Germain, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies and the official in King George&#x27;s government responsible for directing the war, command of the 1777 offensive was given to General Burgoyne instead (an action that prompted Carleton to tender his resignation as Governor of Quebec).

A significant portion of the Continental forces at Fort Ticonderoga were sent south with Generals Gates and Arnold in November to bolster Washington&#x27;s faltering defense of New Jersey. (He had already lost New York City, and by early December had crossed the Delaware River into Pennsylvania, leaving the British free to operate in New Jersey.) Conquering Quebec and other British colonies remained an objective of Congress throughout the war. However, George Washington, who had supported this invasion, considered any further expeditions a low priority that would divert too many men and resources away from the main war in the Thirteen Colonies, so further attempts at expeditions to Quebec were never fully realized.

Several hundred men of British and French descent continued to serve in the ranks of the Continental Army following the retreat of 1776. Under Livingston and Hazen, they served in various theaters of the war, including the siege of Yorktown. Being unable to recover the property they lost in the Province of Quebec, many remained in the army out of necessity and continually pushed American political and military authorities to live up to their financial pledges. At war&#x27;s end, &quot;Canadiens&quot; reunited with women and children who had survived on rations in Albany and Fishkill, New York; some accepted the opportunity to settle a northern New York tract designated for &quot;refugees&quot; from Canada and Nova Scotia.

During the Paris peace talks, American negotiators, including Benjamin Franklin, unsuccessfully demanded all of Quebec as part of the war spoils. In the end, only portions of southwestern Quebec were ceded by Britain to the new United States. In the War of 1812 the Americans launched another invasion of British North America, and again expected the local populace to support them. That failed invasion is now regarded as a significant event in Canadian history; it has even been claimed as the birth of modern Canadian identity.

<text>In marketing and sales, marketing collateral is a collection of media used to support the sales of a product or service. Historically, the term &quot;collateral&quot; specifically referred to brochures or sell sheets developed as sales support tools. These sales aids are intended to make the sales effort easier and more effective.

The brand of the company usually presents itself by way of its collateral to enhance its brand through a consistent message and other media, and must use a balance of information, promotional content, and entertainment.

==Common examples==
There are many items that come under marketing collateral, some common items are:
=== Sales brochures and other printed product information===
These are print materials that summarize a product&#x27;s or service&#x27;s main features and benefits and include a persuasive call to action. They are often distributed to potential customers through direct mail, trade shows, or sales representatives. They aim to increase awareness and adoption of the product or service by providing relevant and concise information.

===Visual aids used in sales presentations===
These are visual elements that complement a verbal sales pitch and help to illustrate and reinforce the key points and arguments. They can be in the form of graphics, charts, tables, images, videos, or animations. They are often displayed on a screen, a board, or a handout. They aim to enhance the effectiveness and memorability of the sales presentation by showing data, comparisons, benefits, features, testimonials, etc.

===Web content===
This is any content that is published on a website or other online platforms, such as blogs, social media, or email newsletters. It can be in the form of text, images, videos, audio, or interactive features. It is often optimized for search engines, lead generation, and conversion. It aims to attract and educate the online audience and persuade them to take a desired action, such as buying, subscribing, or contacting.

===Sales scripts===
These are written guides that outline the steps and techniques for conducting a sales conversation with a prospect or customer. They usually include an introduction, a qualification, a presentation, an objection handling, and a closing. They are often used by sales representatives over the phone or in person. They aim to establish rapport, identify needs, offer solutions, overcome objections, and close the deal.

===Demonstration scripts===
These are written guides that outline the steps and techniques for conducting a sales demonstration of a product or service. They usually include an introduction, a demonstration, a summary, and a call to action. They are often used by sales representatives in person or online. They aim to highlight features, benefits, and value propositions, address pain points and challenges, and create urgency and desire.

===Product data sheets===
These are technical documents that provide detailed information about the specifications, features, functions, performance, compatibility, etc. of a product. They usually include tables, diagrams, charts, or graphs to illustrate the data. They are often used by engineers, technicians, or other experts who need to evaluate or compare the product. They aim to educate the audience about the product’s capabilities and advantages.

===Product white papers===
These are authoritative and informative documents that provide in-depth insights into a specific topic related to a product or industry. They usually include data, facts, statistics, case studies, or research findings to support the arguments. They are often used by decision-makers, influencers, or researchers who need to understand or solve a problem or opportunity. They aim to educate the audience about the topic.

===Promotional pictures===
These are images that showcase a product or service in an attractive and appealing way. They usually include high-quality photos or illustrations of the product or service in use or in context.

<text>Rear-Admiral The Honourable Edward Barry Stewart Bingham, VC, OBE (26 July 1881 – 24 September 1939) served in the Royal Navy during the First World War and was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in engaging the German fleet during the Battle of Jutland.

==Military career==
The third son of Lord Clanmorris, Edward Bingham was born in Bangor Castle, County Down, Ireland. Educated at Arnold House and in HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;, he entered the Royal Navy in 1895 as an acting sub-lieutenant. He was confirmed as a sub-lieutenant 15 March 1901. At the beginning of the First World War, he was appointed Commander (Executive Officer) of , which saw action at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914.

On 31 May 1916, during the Battle of Jutland off Denmark, Commander Bingham was in command of a destroyer division. He led his division in their attack, first on enemy destroyers and then on the battle cruisers of the German High Seas Fleet. Once the enemy was sighted Bingham ordered his own destroyer, , and the one remaining destroyer of his division, , to close to within 2,750 meters of the opposing battle fleet so that he could bring his torpedoes to bear. While making this attack &quot;Nestor&quot; and &quot;Nicator&quot; were under concentrated fire of the secondary batteries of the German fleet and &quot;Nestor&quot; was subsequently sunk. For his actions, Bingham earned the Victoria Cross, one of relatively few awarded for naval bravery during World War I.

Bingham was picked up by the Germans at Jutland, and remained a prisoner of war (latterly at Holzminden) until the Armistice. After the war, he remained with the Royal Navy and retired as a Rear Admiral in 1932. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Bingham died in 1939 and is buried in the Golders Green cemetery in northwest London.

== Family ==
In 1915, Bingham married Vera Patterson; they had a son and a daughter. The marriage was dissolved in 1937.
==Victoria Cross medal==
Bingham&#x27;s Victoria Cross was auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s in 1983 and was purchased by the North Down Borough Council, County Down, who outbid a Canadian millionaire. It is on display at the North Downs Museum in Bangor Castle.

Bingham&#x27;s Victoria Cross and his Order of St Stanislaus medal were both stolen by an opportunist thief in 2001. He was quickly caught and when the items were valued with help from the Imperial War Museum, at tens of thousands of pounds, the thief was charged with a major theft.

<doc id="291180" wikidata="Q180035" url="?curid=291180" title="Mountain hare">
<text>The mountain hare (Lepus timidus), also known as blue hare, tundra hare, variable hare, white hare, snow hare, alpine hare, and Irish hare, is a species of Palearctic hare that is largely adapted to polar and mountainous habitats.

==Evolution==
The mountain hare arose during the Late Pleistocene; there is evidence that its range expanded during glaciations into southern Europe, with populations of Iberian hare (&quot;Lepus granatensis&quot;), European hare (&quot;L. europaeus)&quot; and broom hare (&quot;L. castroviejoi&quot;) in northern Iberia harboring mitochondrial haplotypes from the mountain hare.
During the Late Pleistocene to Early Holocene, populations of mountain hare in Russia grew at least 10% larger than any living population today. This population has been classified as a distinct species &quot;Lepus tanaiticus&quot;, but is now generally considered a prehistoric morphotype of the living mountain hare.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is distributed from Fennoscandia to eastern Siberia; in addition, isolated mountain populations occur in the Alps, Scotland, the Baltics, northeastern Poland, and Hokkaidō. In Ireland, the Irish hare (&quot;L. t. hibernicus&quot;) lives on lowland pastures, coastal grasslands, and salt marshes, not just in the mountains. The mountain hare has also been introduced to Iceland, Shetland, Orkney, the Isle of Man, the Peak District, Svalbard, the Kerguelen Islands, the Crozet Islands, and the Faroe Islands. In the Alps, the mountain hare lives at elevations from , depending on geographic region and season.

==Description==
The mountain hare is a large species, though it is slightly smaller than the European hare. It grows to a length of , with a tail of , and a mass of , females being slightly heavier than males. They can live for up to 12 years. In summer, for all populations of mountain hares, the coat is various shades of brown. In preparation for winter most populations moult into a white (or largely white) pelage. The tail remains completely white all year round, distinguishing the mountain hare from the European hare (&quot;Lepus europaeus&quot;), which has a black upper side to the tail. The subspecies &quot;Lepus timidus hibernicus&quot; (the Irish mountain hare) is smaller in size and stays brown all year. The Irish hare may also have a &quot;golden&quot; variation, particularly those found on Rathlin Island.

In the Faroe Islands, mountain hares turn grey in the winter instead of white. The winter-grey colour may be caused by downregulation of the agouti hair cycle isoform in the autumn moult.

== Behaviour ==
The diet of the mountain hare varies from region to region. It seems to be somewhat dependent on the particular habitat in which the population under study lives. For example, in northern Scandinavia, where snow may blanket the ground for many months, the hares may feed on twigs and bark. In areas where snowfall is rare, such as Ireland, grass may form the bulk of the diet. Given a choice, mountain hares in Scotland and Ireland seem to prefer grazing (feeding on grasses). For mountain hares on a coastal grassland environment in Ireland, grasses constituted over 90% of their diet. This was higher than the percentage of grass in the diet of the European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) that inhabited the same environment. The mountain hare is regionally the favourite prey of the golden eagle and may additionally be preyed on by Eurasian eagle-owls and red foxes. Stoats may prey on young hares.

In southern parts of Finland, Norway, and Sweden, the mountain hare and the European hare compete for habitat. The European hare, being larger, is usually able to drive away the mountain hare, but is less adapted for living in snowy regions; its feet are smaller and its winter fur is a mixture of white and brown. While this winter fur is actually a very good camouflage in the coastal regions of Finland where the snow covers the shrubs only a short time, the mountain hare is better adapted for the snowier conditions of the inland areas. The two may occasionally cross.

The Arctic hare (&quot;Lepus arcticus&quot;) was once considered a subspecies of the mountain hare, but it is now regarded as a separate species. Similarly, some scientists believe that the Irish hare should be regarded as a separate species. Fifteen subspecies are currently recognised.

== Human impact ==
In the European Alps, the mountain hare lives at elevations from , depending on biographic region and season. The development of alpine winter tourism has increased rapidly since the last few decades of the 20th century, resulting in expansion of ski resorts, growing visitor numbers, and a huge increase in all forms of snow sport activities. A 2013 study looking at stress events and the response of mountain hares to disturbance concluded that those hares living in areas of high winter recreational activities showed changes in physiology and behaviour that demanded additional energy input at a time when access to food resources is restricted by snow. It recommended ensuring that forests inhabited by mountain hares were kept free of tourist development, and that new skiing areas should be avoided in mountain hare habitat, and that existing sites should not be expanded.

In August 2016, the Scottish animal welfare charity OneKind launched a campaign on behalf of the mountain hare, as a way of raising awareness of mountain hare culls taking place across the country and in garnering public support for the issue. Mountain hares are routinely shot in the Scottish Highlands both as part of paid hunting &quot;tours&quot; and by gamekeepers managing red grouse populations (who believe that mountain hares can be vectors of diseases that affect the birds). Much of this activity is secretive, but investigations have revealed that tens of thousands of hares are being culled every year. The campaign, which urges people to proclaim, &quot;We Care For The Mountain Hare&quot;, will culminate with the charity urging the Scottish government to legislate against commercial hunting and culling of the iconic Scottish species. The campaign has revealed widespread public support for a ban on hare hunting in Scotland. On May 17, 2020, MSPs voted to ban the unlicensed culling of mountain hares and grant them protected species status within Scotland after a petition started by Green MSP Alison Johnstone gathered over 22,000 signatures.

In 2021, the People&#x27;s Trust for Endangered Species funded a survey of mountain hare populations in the UK&#x27;s Peak District after concerns about the viability of the isolated population, believed to be as low as 2,500. The trust believes climate change is a threat to long-term survival of the Peak District population, which was introduced to the area in the 1870s.
