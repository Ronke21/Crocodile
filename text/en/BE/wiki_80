<text>Georgian Bay () is a large bay of Lake Huron, in the Laurentia bioregion. It is located entirely within the borders of Ontario, Canada. The main body of the bay lies east of the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island. To its northwest is the North Channel.

Georgian Bay is surrounded by (listed clockwise) the districts of Manitoulin, Sudbury, Parry Sound and Muskoka, as well as the more populous counties of Simcoe, Grey and Bruce. The Main Channel separates the Bruce Peninsula from Manitoulin Island and connects Georgian Bay to the rest of Lake Huron. The North Channel, located between Manitoulin Island and the Sudbury District, west of Killarney, was once a popular route for steamships and is now used by a variety of pleasure craft to travel to and from Georgian Bay.

The shores and waterways of the Georgian Bay are the traditional domain of the Anishinaabeg First Nations peoples to the north and Huron-Petun (Wyandot) to the south. The bay was thus a major Algonquian-Iroquoian trade route. 

==Etymology==
Georgian Bay has been known by several names. To the Ojibwe, it is known as &quot;Spirit Lake&quot;. To the Huron-Wendat, it is known as Lake Attigouatan. Samuel de Champlain, the first European to explore and map the area in 1615–1616, called it &quot;La Mer douce&quot; (the sweet/calm/fresh sea), which was a reference to the bay&#x27;s freshwater. It was named &quot;Lake Manitoulin&quot; by Royal Navy Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen. In 1822, after Great Britain had taken over the territory, Lieutenant Henry Wolsey Bayfield of a Royal Navy expedition named it as &quot;Georgian Bay&quot; (after King George IV).

==Geography==
Georgian Bay is about long by wide. It covers approximately , making it nearly 80% the size of Lake Ontario.

Eastern Georgian Bay is part of the southern edge of the Canadian Shield, granite bedrock exposed by the glaciers at the end of the last ice age, about 11,000 years ago. The granite rock formations and windswept eastern white pine are characteristic of the islands and much of the shoreline of the bay. The rugged beauty of the area inspired landscapes by artists of the Group of Seven. The western part of the bay, from Collingwood north, and including Manitoulin, Drummond, Cockburn and St. Joseph islands, borders the Niagara Escarpment. Because of its size and narrowness of the straits joining it with the rest of Lake Huron, which is analogous to if not as pronounced as the separation of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, Georgian Bay is sometimes called the &quot;sixth Great Lake&quot;.

If Georgian Bay were considered a lake in its own right, it would be the fourth largest lake located entirely within Canada (after Great Bear Lake, Great Slave Lake and Lake Winnipeg). With Georgian Bay, Lake Huron is considered to be the second largest of the Great Lakes - if Georgian Bay were excluded, Lake Huron would be the third largest (after Lake Superior and Lake Michigan, but still ahead of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario).

There are tens of thousands of islands in Georgian Bay. Most of these islands are along the east side of the bay and are collectively known as the &quot;Thirty Thousand Islands&quot;, including the larger Parry Island. Manitoulin Island, lying along the northern side of the bay, is the world&#x27;s largest island in a freshwater lake. The Trent–Severn Waterway connects Georgian Bay to Lake Ontario, running from Port Severn in the southeastern corner of Georgian Bay through Lake Simcoe into Lake Ontario near Trenton. Further north, Lake Nipissing drains into Georgian Bay through the French River. In October 2004, the Georgian Bay Littoral was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO.

==History==

Archaeological records reveal an Aboriginal presence in the southern regions of the Canadian Shield dating from 11,000 years ago. Evidence of later Paleo-Indian settlements have been found on Manitoulin Island and near Killarney.

During the period of deglaciation, a succession of prehistoric lakes in the Huron basin caused shoreline advance and retreat. The former shoreline of pro-glacial Lake Algonquin left behind high ridges which were attractive sites for human occupation. As shorelines retreated, the highly mobile Paleo-Indian groups of the period were able to migrate northward into this new land. Declining water levels created two distinct lakes in the Huron basin: Lake Stanley and Lake Hough, the latter of which corresponds to the modern Georgian Bay. Lake Stanley drained into Lake Hough through a spillway. While it is sometimes unclear whether some sites were contemporaneous with shorelines or were located a distance inland, sites are geographically-temporally stratified in correspondence with water levels. 

For example, at two sites along Batteaux Creek near modern-day Collingwood adjacent to the south shore of Georgian Bay, the transitional Late Paleo-IndianEarly Archaic McKean site corresponds to the relatively low water ebb of Lake Hough, while the Middle Archaic Rentner site (likely a true shoreline site) reflects the high water levels of the later Nipissing transgression.

At the time of European contact, the Ojibwe and Ottawa First Nations, both of whom call themselves Anishinaabe (plural: &quot;Anishinaabeg&quot;), lived along the northern, eastern and western shores of Georgian Bay. The Huron (or Wendat) and Petun inhabited the lands along the southern coast, having migrated from the northern shores of Lake Ontario. Names of islands such as &quot;Manitoulin&quot; (from &quot;Gitchi Manitou&quot;, the Great Spirit who left the bay as a source of life for the first people) and &quot;Giant&#x27;s Tomb&quot; are indicative of the richness of the cultural history of the area. Aboriginal communities continue to live on their territories and practise their cultural traditions.

The first European to visit this area was likely Étienne Brûlé, who at age less than 20, in 1610 was sent to live as an interpreter trainee with the Onontchataronon, an Algonquian people of the Ottawa River. They travelled every winter to live with the Arendarhonon people of the Huron-Wendat Nation at the southern end of Georgian Bay, in the area now called Huronia. Brulé returned to the Arendarhonon the following year. At the same time another young interpreter trainee, a youth remembered only as Thomas, who was employed by the French surgeon and trader Daniel Boyer, also likely made it to Huronia, in the company of the Onontchataronon, another member of the confederacy.

In 1615, Brulé&#x27;s employer, the French explorer Samuel de Champlain, made his own visit to Georgian Bay and overwintered in Huronia. He was preceded that summer by a Récollet missionary, Joseph Le Caron, who would live among the Huron in 1615–1616 and 1623–1624. Another Récollet missionary, Gabriel Sagard, lived there from 1623–34. The French Jesuit Jean de Brébeuf began a mission in Huronia in 1626. In 1639 he oversaw the building of the mission fort of Sainte-Marie, Ontario&#x27;s first European settlement, at what is now the town of Midland. The reconstructed Jesuit mission, Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, is now a historic park operated by Huronia Historical Parks, an agency of the Ontario Ministry of Tourism and Culture. Also nearby is the Martyrs&#x27; Shrine, a Catholic church dedicated to the Canadian Martyrs, Jesuits who were killed during Iroquois warfare against the Huron around Georgian Bay in the 17th century. The Bay appears on maps of the time as &quot;Toronto Bay&quot;.

Penetanguishene, the location of an Ojibwe village located at the southern tip of the bay near present-day Midland, was developed as a naval base in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe, first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. In 1814, during the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States, one of the battles was fought in southern Georgian Bay. On August 17, at the mouth of the Nottawasaga River near Wasaga Beach, the British schooner HMS &quot;Nancy&quot; was sunk by three American vessels. Several weeks later, &quot;Nancy&quot; was avenged when British boarding parties in the De Tour Passage surprised and captured two of the three American vessels.

The first nautical charts of Georgian Bay were made in 1815 by Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen, who called it Lake Manitoulin. Captain Henry Bayfield, who made more detailed charts of the bay, renamed it in 1822 after King George IV. His charts are the basis for those in use today.

The Canadian Hydrographic Service traces its history back to 1883, when it was originally established as the Georgian Bay Survey, tasked with charting and improving knowledge of the bay after a steamship wrecked there the previous year, killing 150 of its passengers.

Over the years, 32 lighthouses were built on Georgian Bay. Six of them were designed with limestone towers; these were built in the 1850s and are known collectively as the Imperial Towers. Some of the 32 can be toured by the public, some cannot, and some are accessible only by tour boats or private boat.

==Legend of Kitchikewana==

Wyandot legend tells of a god called Kitchikewana, who was large enough to guard the whole of the Georgian Bay. Kitchikewana was known for his great temper, and his tribe decided the best way to calm him was with a wife. They held a grand celebration, and many women came. Kitchikewana met a woman named Wanakita here. He decided that this was the woman he wanted to marry, and started planning the wedding immediately after she left. But when she was invited back, she told Kitchikewana that she was already engaged. Enraged, Kitchikewana destroyed all the decorations, running to one end of Beausoleil Island and grabbing a large ball of earth. Running to the other end, he tossed it into the Great Lakes. Thus, the 30,000 Islands were created. The indentations left behind by his fingers form the five bays of Georgian Bay: Midland Bay, Penetang Bay, Hog Bay, Sturgeon Bay, and Matchedash Bay. He then lay down to sleep and sleeps there still as Giant&#x27;s Tomb Island.

The town of Penetanguishene now has a large statue of Kitchikewana on its main street. There is a YMCA summer camp for youth located on Beausoleil Island, in southern Georgian Bay, named after Kitchikewana. YMCA Camp Kitchikewana, or Kitchi for short, has been located in Georgian Bay Islands National Park since 1919. Originally operated by the Midland YMCA, it is now the residential camp for youth from the YMCA of Simcoe/Muskoka.

==Settlements==
Wasaga Beach has now passed Collingwood as the largest town on the bay, not long after Collingwood had surpassed Owen Sound. Owen Sound served for a long time as a shipping and rail depot for the Upper Great Lakes. The towns of Midland and Penetanguishene and villages of Port Severn and Honey Harbour are at the southeastern end of the bay and are popular sites for summer cottages, as are the many bays and islands on the eastern coast. Collingwood, Meaford, and Wasaga Beach are located at the southern end of the bay, around Nottawasaga Bay. Owen Sound, Wiarton, and Lion&#x27;s Head are located on the Bruce Peninsula along the southern and southwestern shores of the bay, while Tobermory is located at the northern tip of the Bruce Peninsula on the Main Channel. The passenger ferry travels from Tobermory across the Main Channel to South Baymouth on Manitoulin Island. Parry Sound, the world&#x27;s deepest freshwater port, is located on the eastern shore of the bay. 

There are communities of summer cottages on the north and east shore and on the adjacent 30,000 Islands. These include areas such as Cognashene, Wah Wah Taysee, Sans Souci, Pointe au Baril and Byng Inlet. Most of these cottages are accessible only by water.

<doc id="289926" wikidata="Q3120070" url="?curid=289926" title="William Malet (companion of William the Conqueror)">
<text>William Malet (Anglo-Norman: Willame Malet de Graville, died 1071) held senior positions within the Norman forces that occupied England from 1066. He was appointed the second High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1068. Of the so-called companions of William of Normandy, Malet is one of about a dozen for whom there is evidence of their presence at the Battle of Hastings of 14 October 1066. For example, the contemporary chronicler William of Poitiers recorded that Malet was present at the battle. 

According to apocryphal accounts, Malet was related to both William of Normandy and King Harold of England. Some accounts claim that Malet took charge of Harold&#x27;s body following the Norman victory at Hastings. However, there is no evidence confirming such claims.

Malet held substantial property in Normandy – chiefly in the Pays de Caux, with a castle at (now a suburb of Le Havre). After 1066, he held many properties in England as well, most of them in Yorkshire and East Anglia.

==Biography==

===Early life===
According to unverifiable, apocryphal accounts, Malet had significant, multiple ties to the Anglo-Saxon elite before the Norman Conquest.

* Malet&#x27;s mother was said to be English.

* He was said to be the brother of Ælgifu, wife of Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia (and, therefore, daughter-in-law of Lady Godiva).

* In or about January 1066, King Harold married Ealdgyth, often known as Edith (the dowager of Welsh king Gruffydd ap Llywelyn) and a daughter of Ælgifu and Ælfgar of Mercia. If Malet &quot;was&quot; a biological uncle of the queen consort of England in 1066, he would probably have been pivotal to Norman-English relations at around the time of the Battle of Hastings.

However, modern historians discount any blood-links to Anglo-Saxon royalty or aristocracy, noting instead that there was considerable Norman influence in England even before 1066.

===Battle of Hastings===
There is evidence that Malet fought on the Norman side at Hastings, regardless of any divided loyalties that may have been caused by family ties. For instance, William of Poitiers wrote of King Harold&#x27;s remains: &quot;His corpse was brought into the Duke&#x27;s camp and William [of Normandy] gave it for burial to William, surnamed Malet, and not to Harold&#x27;s mother, who offered for the body of her beloved son its weight in gold.&quot; If Malet was at the Norman headquarters, immediately after the battle, it would be strong evidence that he played a significant role in the Norman victory.

===High Sheriff of Yorkshire===
Malet&#x27;s activities during the first few years of the Norman Conquest of England are not known. Early on he was granted the great honour of Eye, with vast lands in Suffolk and several other shires. It was in fact the largest lordship in East Anglia. He made Eye his caput, his main headquarters, built a motte and bailey castle there, and started a highly successful market. He is credited with initiating the urbanization of Eye.

After the Danish stronghold York was captured in 1068, he was appointed the second High Sheriff of Yorkshire. William was in charge of the garrisons defending the shire, and built a timbered castle fortress on a motte in York and another wooden castle across the River Ouse. His efforts at defending the shire from Danish raids were, in the end, a terrible failure, for the next year the city was burned and the garrison slaughtered. Malet, his wife, and two of their children were held as hostages, and finally released when the Danes were driven off.

Malet was relieved of his duties in the north, but his efforts to defend the kingdom did not go unappreciated. He stayed in the king&#x27;s favour and was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk about 1069/70, and appointment that passed to his son Robert upon his death.

==In historical literature &amp; the media==
The Domesday Book of 1086 also mentions a Durand Malet, who held land in Lincolnshire and possibly some neighbouring shires. This may be William Malet&#x27;s brother, but this is not certain.

On screen, Malet has been portrayed by Peter Halliday in the two-part BBC TV play &quot;Conquest&quot; (1966), part of the series &quot;Theatre 625&quot;, and by Gawn Grainger in the TV drama &quot;Blood Royal: William the Conqueror&quot; (1990).

==Family==
While still in Normandy, about 1050, William married Hesilia (Helise or Elisee), daughter of Gilbert de Brionne. Hesilia was the second cousin of William the Conqueror and possibly the widow of Balderic Teutonicus (Balderic de Courcy; Balderic de Bacqueville).
William and Hesilia had two sons and at least one daughter:
*Robert Malet (c. 1050 – by 1130)
*Gilbert Malet, founder of the Malets of Shepton Mallet in Somerset.
*Beatrice, wife of William de Archis
Thorold, the sheriff of Lincoln and father of Lucy Bolingbroke was married to a daughter of William, either Beatrice (before she married William de Achis) or another, unknown daughter.

==Death==
William Malet died around 1071, probably during the rebellion of Hereward the Wake, although Kirk, referencing Stapleton&#x27;s Norman Pipe Rolls, assigns his death to 1069 and the siege of York.
He was succeeded by his son Robert as Lord of Eye and Sheriff of Suffolk.

<text>John Aikin (15 January 1747 – 7 December 1822) was an English medical doctor and surgeon. Later in life he devoted himself wholly to biography and writing in periodicals.

==Life==
He was born at Kibworth Harcourt, Leicestershire, England, son of John Aikin, Unitarian divine, and received his elementary education at the Nonconformist academy at Warrington, where his father was a tutor. He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, and in London under William Hunter. He practised as a surgeon at Chester and Warrington. Finally, he went to Leiden in Holland, earned an M.D. in 1780, and in 1784 established himself as a doctor in Great Yarmouth.

In 1792, one of his pamphlets having given offence, he moved to London, where he practised as a consulting physician. He lived in Church Street, Stoke Newington. However, he concerned himself more with the advocacy of liberty of conscience than with his professional duties, and he began at an early period to devote himself to literary pursuits, to which his contributions were incessant. When Richard Phillips founded &quot;The Monthly Magazine&quot; in 1796, Aikin was its first editor. In conjunction with his sister, Anna Laetitia Barbauld, he published a popular series of volumes entitled &quot;Evenings at Home&quot; (6 vols, 1792–1795), for elementary family reading, which were translated into almost every European language.

==Works==

In 1798 Aikin retired altogether from medicine and devoted himself to literary undertakings such as his &quot;General Biography&quot; (10 vols, 1799–1815). His other work included &quot;Biographical Memoirs of Medicine in Great Britain&quot; (1780), &quot;The Arts of Life... described in a series of letters. For the instruction of young persons&quot; (1802, reprinted 1807), and &quot;The Lives of John Selden, Esq., and Archbishop Usher&quot; (1812).

Apart from editing &quot;The Monthly Magazine&quot; (1796–1807) and Dodsley&#x27;s &quot;Annual Register&quot; (1811–1815), Aikin produced a paper called &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; in 1807–1809, not to be confused with the well-known magazine &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; (1828–1921).

==Family==
Aikin had four children, three sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Arthur, was a prominent scientist, and the youngest, Edmund, an architect. The second son, Charles, was adopted by Aikin&#x27;s sister, who had no children. Through Charles, Aikin was grandfather to the writer Anna Letitia Le Breton. His daughter Lucy was a biographer, who in 1823 published &quot;Memoir of John Aikin, M.D., with a selection of Miscellaneous Pieces, Biographical, Moral and Critical&quot;.

<text>A land run or land rush was an event in which previously restricted land of the United States was opened to homestead on a first-arrival basis. Lands were opened and sold first-come or by bid, or won by lottery, or by means other than a run. The settlers, no matter how they acquired occupancy, purchased the land from the United States General Land Office. For former Indian lands, the Land Office distributed the sales funds to the various tribal entities, according to previously negotiated terms. The Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 was the most prominent of the land runs while the Land Run of 1893 was the largest. The opening of the former Kickapoo area in 1895 was the last use of a land run in the present area of Oklahoma.

==In Oklahoma==
After years of raids—led by the leaders of the Boomers activist movement such as David L. Payne—into the central area of what would become the U.S. state of Oklahoma, Congress finally agreed to open what was dubbed the Unassigned Lands. Seven land runs in all took place in Oklahoma, beginning with the initial and most famous Land Rush of April 22, 1889, which gave rise to the terms &quot;Eighty-Niner&quot; (a veteran of that run) and &quot;Sooner.&quot; That area led to today&#x27;s Canadian, Cleveland, Kingfisher, Logan, Oklahoma, and Payne counties of Oklahoma.

The nearly two million acres of land opened up to white settlement was located in Indian Territory, a large area that once encompassed much of modern-day Oklahoma. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 eventually led to the Trail of Tears. Creek and Seminole tribes were granted area known before the Land Run as the Unassigned Lands. Some American Indian tribes signed a treaty of alliance with the Confederacy in 1861. Initially considered unsuitable for white colonization, Indian Territory was thought to be an ideal place to relocate Native Americans who were removed from their traditional lands to make way for white settlement. The relocations began in 1817, and by the 1880s, Indian Territory was a new home to a variety of tribes, including the Chickasaw, Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Cheyenne, Comanche, and Apache.

The Land Run of September 22, 1891, opened the Iowa, Sac and Fox, Potawatomi, and Shawnee lands to settlement. The land run opened 6,097 plots of each of former reservation land. On the following day, a land run was held to settle Tecumseh, the pre-designated location of the county seat of County B, later renamed as Pottawatomie County. On September 28, 1891, another land run was held to settle Chandler, the pre-designated location of the county seat of County A, later renamed as Lincoln County.

The Land Run of April 19, 1892, opened the Cheyenne and Arapaho lands.

The Land Run of September 16, 1893 was known as the Cherokee Strip Land Run. It opened 8,144,682.91 acres (12,726 square miles or about 3.3 million hectares) to settlement. The land was purchased from the Cherokees. It was the largest land run in U.S. history, four times larger than the Land Rush of 1889. The Cherokee Strip Regional Heritage Center museum at the eastern edge of Enid, Oklahoma commemorates this event.

The final land run in Oklahoma was the Land Run of 1895 to settle the Kickapoo lands. Each run had exhibited many problems and the Federal Government deemed the run to be an inefficient way to distribute land to would-be settlers. After 1895, the government distributed land by sealed-bid auctions. Major openings by this method included Kiowa-Comanche-Apache Reservation (1901), the Wichita-Caddo Reservation (1901), and the Big Pasture (1906).

There was one land run in the 20th century, but on a much smaller scale, held to select lots in the community of Arcadia, on August 6, 1901. This was similar to the run to settle Chandler in 1891.

==Legacy==
In honor of Oklahoma&#x27;s Centennial of statehood, sculptor Paul Moore won the commission for the Oklahoma Centennial Land Run Monument. As Moore completed elements of the 45-piece monument, such as horses and riders, wagons and horse teams, dogs, and others, they were installed in lower Bricktown, Oklahoma City. To be completed at a future date the monument covers approximately , making it overall one of the largest bronze sculptures in the world.

==In popular culture==
*The 1889 and 1893 Oklahoma Land Runs were portrayed in Edna Ferber&#x27;s 1929 novel, &quot;Cimarron&quot;, as well as the 1931 and 1960 films of the same name based on the novel.
*The Land Run of 1893, also known as the Cherokee Strip Land Run, was portrayed in the films &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; (1925) and &quot;Far and Away&quot; (1992) and was also depicted in 1969 novel &quot;The Thundering Prairie&quot; by M. A. Hancock.

<text>The following is a list of burials in the [[Valley of the Kings]], in Thebes (modern Luxor, Egypt) and nearby areas.

The numbering system was established by John Gardner Wilkinson in 1821. Wilkinson numbered the 21 tombs known to him (some of which had been open since antiquity) according to their location, starting at the entrance to the valley and then moving south and west. Tombs that have been discovered since then have been allocated a sequential KV number (those in the Western Valley are known by the WV equivalent) in the order of their discovery.

Since the mid 20th century, Egyptologists have used the acronym &quot;KV&quot; (standing for Kings&#x27; Valley) to designate tombs located in the Valley of the Kings. Additionally, the acronym &quot;WV&quot; is also used to designate tombs located in the West Valley (of the Kings).

== East Valley ==

Most of the open tombs in the Valley of the Kings are located in the East Valley, and this is where most tourists can be found.

== West Valley ==
The numbering the West Valley follows in sequence to that of the East Valley, and there are only five known burials/pits in the valley.

<doc id="289950" wikidata="Q219718" url="?curid=289950" title="George Emil Palade">
<text>George Emil Palade (; November 19, 1912 – October 7, 2008) was a Romanian-American cell biologist. Described as &quot;the most influential cell biologist ever&quot;, in 1974 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Albert Claude and Christian de Duve. The prize was granted for his innovations in electron microscopy and cell fractionation which together laid the foundations of modern molecular cell biology, the most notable discovery being the ribosomes of the endoplasmic reticulum – which he first described in 1955.

Palade also received the U.S. National Medal of Science in Biological Sciences for &quot;pioneering discoveries of a host of fundamental, highly organized structures in living cells&quot; in 1986, and was previously elected a Member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1961. In 1968 he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society (HonFRMS) and in 1984 he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS).

==Education and early life==
George Emil Palade was born on November 19, 1912, in Iași, Romania; his father was a professor of philosophy at the University of Iași and his mother was a high school teacher. Palade received his M.D. in 1940 from the Carol Davila School of Medicine in Bucharest.

==Career and research==

Palade was a member of the faculty at University of Bucharest until 1946, when he went to the United States to do postdoctoral research. While assisting Robert Chambers in the Biology Laboratory of New York University, he met Professor Albert Claude. He later joined Claude at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.

In 1952, Palade became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He worked at the Rockefeller Institute (1958–1973), and was a professor at Yale University Medical School (1973–1990), and University of California, San Diego (1990–2008). At UCSD, Palade was Professor of Medicine in Residence (Emeritus) in the Department of Cellular &amp; Molecular Medicine, as well as a Dean for Scientific Affairs (Emeritus), in the School of Medicine at La Jolla, California.

In 1970, he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University, together with Renato Dulbecco (winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine) &quot;for discoveries concerning the functional organization of the cell that were seminal events in the development of modern cell biology&quot;, related to his previous research carried out at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. His Nobel lecture, delivered on December 12, 1974, was entitled: &quot;Intracellular Aspects of the Process of Protein Secretion&quot;, published in 1992 by the Nobel Prize Foundation, He was elected an Honorary member of the Romanian Academy in 1975. He received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1975. In 1981, Palade became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. 
In 1985, he became the founding editor of the &quot;Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology&quot;.
In 1988 he was also elected an Honorary Member of the American-Romanian Academy of Arts and Sciences (ARA).

Palade was the first Chairman of the Department of Cell Biology at Yale University. Presently, the Chair of Cell Biology at Yale is named the &quot;George Palade Professorship&quot;.

At the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, Palade used electron microscopy to study the internal organization of such cell structures as ribosomes, mitochondria, chloroplasts, the Golgi apparatus, and others. His most important discovery was made while using an experimental strategy known as a pulse-chase analysis. In the experiment Palade and his colleagues were able to confirm an existing hypothesis that a secretory pathway exists and that the Rough ER and the Golgi apparatus function together.

He focused on Weibel-Palade bodies (a storage organelle unique to the endothelium, containing von Willebrand factor and various proteins) which he described together with the Swiss anatomist Ewald R. Weibel.

===Palade&#x27;s coworkers and approach in the 1960s===
The following is a concise excerpt from Palade&#x27;s Autobiography appearing in the Nobel Award documents

One notes also that the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 2009 to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, Thomas A. Steitz, and Ada E. Yonath &quot;for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome&quot;, discovered by George Emil Palade.

==Personal life==
He married Irina Malaxa (born in 1919, the daughter of industrialist Nicolae Malaxa) on June 12, 1941. The couple had two children: Georgia (born in 1943) and Theodore (born in 1949). After his wife died in 1969, Palade married Marilyn Farquhar, a cell biologist at the University of California, San Diego.

<text>U.S. Highway 26 (US 26) is an east–west United States Numbered Highway that runs from Seaside, Oregon, to Ogallala, Nebraska. When the U.S. Numbered Highway System was first defined, it was limited to Nebraska and Wyoming; by the 1950s, it continued into Idaho and Oregon. The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in Ogallala at an intersection with Interstate 80 (I-80). Its western terminus is south of Seaside at an intersection with US 101. Prior to 2004, the route&#x27;s last were cosigned with US 101 from the highways&#x27; junction south of Seaside north to Astoria where its intersection with US 30 was also US 30&#x27;s western terminus. Long segments of the highway follow the historic Oregon Trail. At its peak, immediately before the establishment of the Interstate Highway System, US 26 was in length and terminated in Astoria.

===Oregon===

Starting at a junction with US 101 near Seaside, US 26 heads southeast through the Coast Range to Portland. In the western Portland area, US 26 is a freeway known as the Sunset Highway. After passing through the Vista Ridge Tunnels, heading into Downtown Portland, it intersects with I-405 and runs along the Interstate southbound for about a half-mile () before exiting onto surface streets at the waterfront, meeting Oregon Route 43 (OR 43) at Macadam Avenue before crossing I-5. After crossing the Willamette River and meeting at an incomplete interchange with OR 99E, US 26 then heads east on Powell Boulevard where it crosses I-205 and continues east to Sandy on what is known as the Mount Hood Highway No. 26, a four-lane divided highway that was supposed to be the Mount Hood Freeway, which was never built just south of Division Street.

After passing through Sandy, US 26 (known there as the Mount Hood Highway) continues on toward Government Camp and Bennett Pass, where it eventually meets up with OR 35. The Mount Hood Highway continues north along OR 35, while US 26 heads southeast toward Madras, where it intersects with US 97. It then continues southeast to Prineville, where it meets OR 126 and heads east through John Day where it meets US 20 in Vale. The remainder of US 26 follows US 20 to the Idaho state line.

===Idaho===

From the Oregon state line, US 26 continues to follow US 20 to Boise, with short concurrencies with US 95 near Parma and I-84 at Caldwell. At Boise, US 26/US 20 merges with I-84 for about until Mountain Home, where US 20 splits from US 26/I-84. About later in Bliss, US 26 splits from I-84, joining US 93 at Shoshone with the concurrent routes joining US 20 at Carey. US 20/US 26/US 93 skirt the north edge of Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve and then through Arco where US 93 splits north. Near Idaho National Laboratory, US 26 again splits from US 20 to the southeast, proceeding to Blackfoot, where US 26 joins I-15 for about before splitting just south of Idaho Falls toward Alpine, Wyoming.

===Wyoming===
From Alpine, US 26 is cosigned with US 89 east and north to Hoback Junction, then cosigned with US 89, US 189, and US 191 to Jackson. US 189 ends in Jackson, and the other three highways continue their concurrency through Grand Teton National Park up to Moran. At &quot;Glacier View Turnout&quot;, a view of Teton Glacier, on the north of Grand Teton, can be seen. At Moran, US 26 turns east, concurrent with US 287. Crossing the Continental Divide at Togwotee Pass, US 26 passes through Dubois, the end of the Wyoming Centennial Scenic Byway, and at Diversion Dam Junction, US 26 and US 287 separate; US 26 continues southeast to Riverton, then northeast to Shoshoni. From Shoshoni to Casper, US 26 is cosigned with US 20. US 20/US 26 has a bypass north of Casper, the eastern half of which is concurrent with I-25 and US 87. US 20/US 26/US 87 parallels I-25 from Casper to Glenrock; east of Glenrock, US 26 (along with US 20 and US 87) is cosigned on I-25. US 26 follows I-25 to Dwyer Junction, where it turns east to continue along the Old Oregon Trail. US 26 passes through Guernsey, Fort Laramie, Lingle, and Torrington before entering Nebraska. US 85 is concurrent with US 26 between Lingle and Torrington.

===Nebraska===

US 26 runs southeastward parallel to the North Platte River. The largest city US 26 runs through in Nebraska is Scottsbluff, which is just 22 miles (35 km) from the Wyoming border. US 26 also goes past Chimney Rock National Historic Site. US 26 intersects with US 385 in Bridgeport and then continues to its eastern terminus in Ogallala, Nebraska at I-80. All told, there are of US 26 in the state of Nebraska.

==History==
U.S. Highway 320 (US 320) was part of the initial 1926 system, connecting US 20 in Shoshoni with US 87W in Riverton, Wyoming. It became Wyoming Highway 320 (WYO 320) in 1938, which was extended southwest to Lander in 1940 when US 287 (which had replaced US 87W) was realigned. The original part of US 320/WYO 320 became part of an extension of US 26 in 1950, and the rest of WYO 320 became part of WYO 789 in 1954.

<doc id="289955" wikidata="Q636609" url="?curid=289955" title="Fan-out">
<text>In digital electronics, the fan-out is the number of gate inputs driven by the output of another single logic gate.

In most designs, logic gates are connected to form more complex circuits. While no logic gate input can be fed by more than one output at a time without causing contention, it is common for one output to be connected to several inputs. The technology used to implement logic gates usually allows a certain number of gate inputs to be wired directly together without additional interfacing circuitry. The maximum fan-out of an output measures its load-driving capability: it is the greatest number of inputs of gates of the same type to which the output can be safely connected.

== Logical practice ==

Maximum limits on fan-out are usually stated for a given logic family or device in the manufacturer&#x27;s datasheets. These limits assume that the driven devices are members of the same family.

More complex analysis than fan-in and fan-out is required when two different logic families are interconnected. Fan-out is ultimately determined by the maximum source and sink currents of an output and the maximum source and sink currents of the connected inputs; the driving device must be able to supply or sink at its output the sum of the currents needed or provided (depending on whether the output is a logic high or low voltage level) by all of the connected inputs, while maintaining the output voltage specifications. For each logic family, typically a &quot;standard&quot; input is defined by the manufacturer with maximum input currents at each logic level, and the fan-out for an output is computed as the number of these standard inputs that can be driven in the worst case. (Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by fan-out, even of devices within the same family, if the particular devices being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a &quot;standard&quot; device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the fan-out capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) sink currents of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device&#x27;s guaranteed maximum output-low sink current and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device&#x27;s limits, then it has the DC fan-out capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn&#x27;t, regardless of the manufacturer&#x27;s given fan-out number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the fan-out number will agree.

When high-speed signal switching is required, the AC impedance of the output, the inputs, and the conductors between may significantly reduce the effective drive capacity of output, and this DC analysis may not be enough. See &quot;AC Fan-out&quot; below.

== Theory ==

===DC fan-out===

A perfect logic gate would have infinite input impedance and zero output impedance, allowing a gate output to drive any number of gate inputs. However, since real-world fabrication technologies exhibit less than perfect characteristics, a limit will be reached where a gate output cannot drive any more current into subsequent gate inputs - attempting to do so causes the voltage to fall below the level defined for the logic level on that wire, causing errors.

The fan-out is the number of inputs that can be connected to an output before the current required by the inputs exceeds the current that can be delivered by the output while still maintaining correct logic levels. The current figures may be different for the logic zero and logic one states and in that case we must take the pair that give the lower fan-out. This can be expressed mathematically as

:formula_1
where formula_2 is the floor function.

Going on these figures alone TTL logic gates are limited to perhaps 2 to 10, depending on the type of gate, while CMOS gates have DC fan-outs that are generally far higher than is likely to occur in practical circuits (e.g. using NXP Semiconductor specifications for their HEF4000 series CMOS chips at 25 °C and 15 V gives a fan-out of 34 000).

===AC fan-out===
However, inputs of real gates have capacitance as well as resistance to the power supply rails. This capacitance will slow the output transition of the previous gate and hence increase its propagation delay. As a result, rather than a fixed fan-out the designer is faced with a trade off between fan-out and propagation delay (which affects the maximum speed of the overall system). This effect is less marked for TTL systems, which is one reason why TTL maintained a speed advantage over CMOS for many years.

Often a single signal (as an extreme example, the clock signal) needs to drive far more than 10 things on a chip. Rather than simply wiring the output of a gate to 1000 different inputs, circuit designers have found that it runs much faster to have a tree (as an extreme example, a clock tree) – for example, have the output of that gate drive 10 buffers (or equivalently a buffer scaled 10 times as big as the minimum-size buffer), those buffers drive 100 other buffers (or equivalently a buffer scaled 100 times as big as the minimum-size buffer), and those final buffers to drive the 1000 desired inputs. During physical design, some VLSI design tools do buffer insertion as part of signal integrity design closure.

Likewise, rather than simply wiring all 64 output bits to a single 64-input NOR gate to generate the Z flag on a 64-bit ALU, circuit designers have found that it runs much faster to have a tree – for example, have the Z flag generated by an 8-input NOR gate, and each of their inputs generated by an 8-input OR gate.

Reminiscent of radix economy, one estimate for the total delay of such a tree—the total number of stages by the delay of each stage – gives an optimum (minimum delay) when each stage of the tree is scaled by &quot;e&quot;, approximately 2.7. People who design digital integrated circuits typically insert trees whenever necessary such that the fan-in and fan-out of each and every gate on the chip is between 2 and 10.

Dynamic or AC fan-out, not DC fan-out is therefore the primary limiting factor in many practical cases, due to the speed limitation. For example, suppose a microcontroller has 3 devices on its address and data lines, and the microcontroller can drive 35 pF of bus capacitance at its maximum clock speed. If each device has 8 pF of input capacitance, then only 11 pF of trace capacitance is allowable. (Routing traces on printed circuit boards usually have 1-2 pF per inch so the traces in this case can be 5.5 inches long max.) If this trace length condition can&#x27;t be met, then the microcontroller must be run at a slower bus speed for reliable operation, or a buffer chip with higher current drive must be inserted into the circuit. Higher current drive increases speed since formula_3; more simply, current is rate of flow of charge, so increased current charges the capacitance faster, and the voltage across a capacitor is equal to the charge on it divided by the capacitance. So with more current, voltage changes faster, which allows faster signaling over the bus.

Unfortunately, due to the higher speeds of modern devices, IBIS simulations may be required for exact determination of the dynamic fan-out since dynamic fan-out is not clearly defined in most datasheets. (See the external link for more information.)

<text>The Samjeondo Monument () is a monument marking the submission of the Korean Joseon dynasty to the Manchu-led Qing dynasty in 1636 after the latter&#x27;s invasion of the former. Its original name was Daecheong Hwangje Gongdeok Bi (大淸皇帝功德碑), which means the stele to the merits and virtues of the Emperor of the Great Qing. Initially erected at Samjeondo, near the Sambatnaru crossing point of the Han River in modern-day Seoul, it was thereafter buried and erected again several times. It is designated as the 101st historic site of South Korea.

==Erection==
Following the siege of Namhansanseong, King Injo of Joseon was forced to surrender and accept tributary status to Qing China in 1636. The following year, Hong Taiji, founding emperor of the Qing dynasty, ordered King Injo to put up a monument &quot;in honor of the excellent virtues of the Qing Emperor&quot;. In 1639 it was erected at Samjeondo, where the ceremony of surrender had been conducted. Inscriptions were written in Manchu and Mongolian on the front side and in Hanmun on the back; they have almost identical contents. The Hanmun version was composed by Yi Gyeongseok (李景奭), and the rest seem to have been translated from it.

Samjeondo, meaning &quot;crossing of the three fields&quot;, was located near the Sambatnaru, a major crossing point of the Han River in early Joseon times. The Sambatnaru way was the shortest route to the stronghold of Gwangju and the southern provinces. It was also the one most often used to visit the tomb of King Taejong of Joseon at the foot of Mt. Daemosan.

==Timeline==
Because of the strong emotional charge attached to it, this monument has been buried and then erected again several times from 1639 till nowadays.

* 1895. The monument was buried down as a result of the Treaty of Shimonoseki that concluded the First Sino-Japanese War.
* 1913. The monument is erected again.
* ???. The monument is buried after 1945. During Syngman Rhee&#x27;s presidency (1948–1960), orders were given to destroy the stele, but the Ministry of Culture had it buried instead.
* 1957. South Korean Government designates the site as Historic Site No 101 (1957/02/01).
*1963. The monument becomes visible after the river floods.
* 1983. Monument is placed in a park, 37.503351 N,127.107083 E, i.e. in Seokchon-dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul, South Korea

* 2010. Monument is relocated 37.510407 N, 127.101635 E.

which can be translated as &quot;the stele to the merits and virtues of the Emperor of the Great Qing.&quot;

==Content==

===Description===
Both the Qing and Joseon dynasties saw the inscription as the litmus test for the latter&#x27;s attitude toward the Qing emperor, so King Injo ensured that it flattered the Qing dynasty: the inscription narrates how the king of Joseon came to attach himself to the virtue of the Qing emperor from a Joseon point of view. Although one-sided, it provides a concise account of the Qing-Joseon relationship.

The inscription starts with the description of the Qing campaign against Joseon in 1636. The Qing army besieged the Namhan fortress, where King Injo took refuge. He admitted his guilt, accepted the imperial edict and surrendered at Samjeondo. Since Hong Taiji felt compassion for the Joseon king, he mercifully sent the king back to the capital and rapidly withdrew the army without doing harm to the people.

In the next paragraph, the inscription traces the history back to the Battle of Sarhū in 1619. The Joseon army, led by Gang Hong-rip, put on the appearance of supporting the Ming dynasty but surrendered to the Qing dynasty. However, all of the soldiers except the high-ranking ones were released by Nurhaci, and the inscription emphasizes the merciful act. Since Joseon still displayed disobedient behavior, Hong Taiji commenced the Later Jin invasion of Joseon in 1627. He did not overthrow the kingdom but established a Confucian &quot;elder brother-younger brother&quot; relationship. The inscription then goes on to describe the second campaign. When Hong Taiji proclaimed the Qing dynasty in 1636, Joseon did not accept it even though Qing China announced a war. The inscription stressed his benevolent acts during the war.

Next, the inscription explains the background of erection of the monument. It says that the king voluntarily erected the monument at Samjeondo to let the excellent virtue of the Qing emperor be known around the world.

Finally, the inscription summarizes the entire course of events in verse.

<text>KV55 is a tomb in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt. It was discovered by Edward R. Ayrton in 1907 while he was working in the Valley for Theodore M. Davis. It has long been speculated, as well as much disputed, that the body found in this tomb was that of the famous king, Akhenaten, who moved the capital to Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna). The results of genetic and other scientific tests published in February 2010 have confirmed that the person buried there was both the son of Amenhotep III and the father of Tutankhamun. Furthermore, the study established that the age of this person at the time of his death was consistent with that of Akhenaten, thereby making it almost certain that it is Akhenaten&#x27;s body. However, a growing body of work soon began to appear to dispute the assessment of the age of the mummy and the identification of KV55 as Akhenaten.

Both the tomb&#x27;s history and the identification of its single occupant have been problematic. It is presumed to be a royal cache and reburial dating from the late eighteenth dynasty, prepared after the abandonment of Amarna and the dismantling of the royal necropolis there. On the basis of the recovered artifacts, it is also suggested that the burial once contained more than a single occupant, either interred on one occasion or over a period of time. Queen Tiye is most often named in this context.

It is also clear that the tomb was re-opened at a later time, almost certainly during the twentieth dynasty. At that time, any additional, hypothetical occupants of the tomb would have been removed and (possibly) relocated to KV35, while the remaining mummy and some of the other artefacts were desecrated and abandoned.

The tomb is often referred to as the &quot;Amarna cache&quot;, given the mixed nature of its contents.

==Discovery and excavations==
The entrance to KV55 was uncovered by Ayrton on 6 January 1907. Its discovery was brought to Davis&#x27;s attention on the following day. The tomb was first entered on 9 January by Ayrton, Davis, Joseph Lindon Smith and (as the representative of the antiquities service) Arthur Weigall. On 11 January 1907, the finds were photographed. Ayrton then began clearance of the tomb. On 25 January 1907, the coffin and mummy were investigated &quot;in situ&quot;.

According to a letter from Davis to Gaston Maspero, some of the objects found in KV55 were still in place in January 1908, and their study and attempts at conservation were still ongoing at that later date. In 1921, while excavating south of the tomb, Howard Carter discovered several items that seem to have originated in KV55. These include a jasper burnisher and some fragments of copper rosettes from a funerary pall.

After its excavation, the tomb&#x27;s entrance was initially fitted with a steel door, which was later removed and replaced by stone blocking. By 1944, this blocking had collapsed and filled the tomb&#x27;s entrance with debris. In 1993, the tomb was cleared again by Lyla Pinch Brock. In 1996, she undertook conservation work on the stairs and the plastering inside the burial chamber through a grant from the American Research Centre in Egypt.

===KVC===
Three days before the discovery of KV55, Ayrton uncovered a recess in the rock (now designated as KVC) located immediately above the entrance to KV55 and containing jars of twentieth dynasty type. This recess may have been an unfinished tomb commencement, and its contents may be analogous to the embalming cache found in KV54, but because the find was never properly published, the precise nature of its contents, the date of the jars, and its relation (if any) to KV55 are now unclear.

==The tomb==

===Location and general appearance===

KV55 is a relatively small, undecorated, single-chamber tomb, its total length measuring only 27.61 meters. It is located in the central area of the valley, immediately adjacent to and below KV6 (Ramesses IX) and across the valley floor from KV7 (Ramesses II) and the near-contemporary tomb KV62 (Tutankhamun). Oriented almost due east, its entrance way consists of a set of stairs cut into the valley bedrock that leads to a gently sloping corridor and then to the single chamber of the tomb.

The tomb appears to be unfinished: in the south wall of the burial chamber is a small niche, the commencement of an unfinished antechamber, while red masonry marks within the burial chamber indicate plans for yet another room. When finished these would have made the tomb&#x27;s layout roughly similar to that of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Such a plan seems to indicate that KV55, like KV62, was initially intended as a private burial site and only later taken over for a royal interment.

===Entranceway===
The tomb is accessed by a flight of 20 steps, cut into the bedrock and covered by an overhanging rock. An ostracon found by Pinch Brock in 1993 has been interpreted as a plan of the tomb, and possibly indicates a widening of the entrance after its initial cutting. This possibility is also suggested by mason&#x27;s marks found on the walls by the tomb entrance. It appears that the stairwell has been enlarged, its ceiling raised, and the number of steps increased.

When the tomb was discovered in 1907, the stairwell was covered with debris, probably originating from the cutting of KV6 directly above. The upper layer of this filling consisted of chips cemented together by water; underneath, the chips were dry and clean.

===Doorway and blocking===
When it was discovered, the tomb&#x27;s outer door was blocked by two consecutive walls. The primary blocking consisted of a wall of cemented limestone blocks, plastered and stamped with the seal of the Royal Necropolis (with the jackal and nine captives motif). Weigall later stated that a fragment of Tutankhamun&#x27;s seal had been recovered from this original blocking. However, his statement is not corroborated by any of the other reports dating from the initial discovery, leaving Weigall&#x27;s claim open to question.

The first wall had been partially pulled down in antiquity, and the tomb was closed again by a second wall made of loose limestone fragments, erected in front of the remains of the first wall. Because Weigall described these consecutive blockings in ambiguous terms, it is unclear whether the secondary wall was found intact or had already been partially dismantled, like the primary wall.

===Corridor===
The sloping corridor beyond the entrance was partially filled with rubble. Since the secondary wall was built on top of material originating from this rubble, the fill seems to date from the time of the original interment. By 1907 this rubble had spread down into the burial chamber. Stains on the ceiling and walls of the corridor indicate that water had infiltrated the tomb in the past.

On top of the rubble fill were found a panel and door of a large gilded shrine, although the exact position of these items is unclear. Additional pieces of the same shrine were recovered from the burial chamber.

===Burial chamber and niche===
The walls of the burial chamber were plastered, but otherwise undecorated. This plastering seems to have been done some years after the cutting of the tomb, and repairs are evident. Rubble fill from the corridor had spread down into the chamber, partially covering its floor with debris. Elsewhere in the burial chamber, the floor and numerous objects were covered with fragments of plaster fallen from the walls and stones fallen from the ceiling.

Items found in the burial chamber can be grouped into several categories:
* Parts of a dismantled, gilded shrine: Related to the panel and door found in the corridor. A door was found lying on the rubble inflow near the entrance to the chamber; large panels were lying on the floor or stacked against the eastern wall; and smaller elements (such as doorjambs, a lintel and possibly parts of the cornice) were lying on the floor.
* Coffin, mummy and related items: Lying against the southern wall and resting on the decayed remains of a lion-headed bier was a badly damaged coffin. Its lid was ajar, and the coffin box had rotted. The mummy contained in this coffin was badly preserved but its linen wrappings appear to have been intact. The damaged skull had been separated from the body and was found with a vulture pectoral wrapped around it. The left arm of the body was crossed over the chest, the right arm extended. In the niche above this coffin was found a set of four canopic jars. Also related to this group of items were four &quot;magical bricks&quot;.
* Remains of boxes and their contents: At least two badly preserved boxes were found in the southeastern corner of the room, their contents spread on the floor. These included faience objects and appear to have been related to the &quot;Opening of the Mouth&quot; ceremony.
* Seal impressions: Several small seal impressions were found underneath the panels of the gilded shrine. These carry Tutankhamun&#x27;s prenomen and are identical to seal type N found in Tutankhamun&#x27;s own tomb.
* Other items: Their exact location in the chamber is not always clear. Included are a vase stand, a fragment of furniture, a silver head of a goose, pall-discs of gilded copper and a statue plinth.

Some wooden objects in the burial chamber seem to have suffered water damage, most notably the coffin, bier and boxes; however, the elements of the gilded shrine appear to have been reasonably solid. Moisture is also the likely cause of the discoloration visible on some of the faience objects, although other, similar objects appear unaffected.

==Interpretation==
The problems surrounding the interpretation of KV55 are due in large part to the shortcomings of Davis&#x27;s original publication of the excavation. Its mix of fact, assumption, error and omission has obscured a full understanding of the deposit. The blame for these shortcomings usually falls on Davis (as editor of the publication) and Ayrton (as supervising archaeologist). Recent careful re-examinations of the original publication, of eyewitness reports, and of the photographs taken before the tomb was cleared have brought some clarity to the situation.

Although the tomb was clearly disturbed in antiquity and its contents have been described as disordered and chaotic, Martha Bell argued that this disarray was more apparent than real. Her reconstruction of the layout of the tomb indicates an orderly and deliberate arrangement of artefacts, and she suggests that the impression of chaos might be due to the collapse of wooden objects caused by falling plaster and stone. The &quot;cemented&quot; chips and stains in the corridor indicate that water entered the tomb along the corridor ceiling, but the amount of water might not have been great, and most damage could have been caused by increased humidity rather than direct contact with water. Bell also suggested that the moisture under the mummy might have resulted from rainfall shortly after the tomb&#x27;s opening in 1907. Other damage to wooden objects might result from insects.

===The shrine and Tiye&#x27;s burial===
A recent reconstruction of the shrine, based on photographic evidence, drawings, eyewitness descriptions and two surviving planks on display in Cairo, indicate that it resembled Tutankhamun&#x27;s second and third shrines in general appearance and size. The presence of copper rosettes indicate that a funeral pall was draped on a frame associated with the shrine, also comparable to Tutankhamun&#x27;s shrines. However, the decoration and inscriptions on the shrine are markedly different from those of Tutankhamun: the decoration was dominated by large offering scenes rather than a multitude of smaller mythological scenes; the text was far more brief, and seems primarily concerned with titles, names and the shrine&#x27;s dedication, rather than with excerpts from funerary books; and the interior of the shrine was uninscribed and undecorated.

The text on the shrine states that it was made by Akhenaten for his mother Tiye. With one exception, the names of Akhenaten were erased and in some places were replaced by those of Amenhotep III (the father of Akhenaten) in ink. The text also refers to the &quot;House of the Aten in Akhetaten&quot;, perhaps indicating that the shrine was made and originally used in Amarna. The decoration, which appears to have been very similar on all sides of the shrine, features Akhenaten and Tiye making offerings to the Aten, with a focus on the king rather than his mother. As with his names, Akhenaten&#x27;s figure was erased from the scenes, with one exception.

The orderly arrangement of the shrine parts inside the tomb seems to indicate that it once stood up, fully assembled, with its doors facing south, and that it was later dismantled inside the tomb. It appears that only a single shrine was used in KV55, rather than a suite of four nested shrines, as in the tomb of Tutankhamun.

The presence of a shrine dedicated to Tiye is usually seen as evidence that Tiye&#x27;s mummy once reposed inside the shrine in KV55. Other objects inscribed with her name (such as the piece of furniture) and with those of Amenhotep III are also seen as belonging to her funerary equipment. The seal impressions found near the east wall might indicate further items that were removed together with the queen&#x27;s mummy at some later point.

===Coffin, canopic jars and magical bricks===

When KV55 was initially opened, Theodore Davis believed that he had found the tomb of Queen Tiye. However, it was quickly recognized that the human remains interred there were male. Georges Daressy further deduced that the gilded coffin found in the tomb was originally made for a woman and only later adapted to accommodate a king, through alterations to its inscriptions and the addition of a false beard, a uraeus and the royal scepters (crook and flail). The identity of the coffin&#x27;s original owner has been a matter of much discussion over the years, with Tiye, Nefertiti, Meketaten and Meritaten all proposed as candidates. It is now widely accepted that the coffin was originally intended for Akhenaten&#x27;s secondary wife Kiya. It is also recognized that the four canopic jars discovered near the coffin belonged to Kiya, and that the female heads on the stoppers of the jars portray her. Like the coffin, the canopic jars were altered for the burial of a king through the erasure of Kiya&#x27;s titulary and the addition of a royal uraeus to each portrait head.

All personal names inscribed on the coffin and the canopic jars were excised in antiquity, rendering the identity of the human remains inside the coffin a matter of long debate. Over the past century, the chief candidates for this individual have been either Akhenaten or Smenkhkare, another male member of the Amarna royal family.

Evidence that the occupant of the coffin was Akhenaten is provided by the four magical bricks found inside the tomb. Two were inscribed in hieratic, but they are poorly preserved and the name of their owner is lost. The other two, however, are of better quality, with hieroglyphic inscriptions naming &quot;the Osiris Neferkheprure Waenre&quot;, a reference to Akhenaten&#x27;s nomen. The fact that all four bricks were oriented correctly and that three of them were positioned in close association with the coffin suggests that they were intended as a set and were made for the coffin&#x27;s final occupant, who therefore, would be Akhenaten.

===The identification of the mummy===

The mummy found in the tomb was, however, at first identified as belonging to a woman by two visiting physicians who examined the remains in situ. This led Davis to conclude he had found the mummy of queen Tiye and he therefore published his account of the discovery as &quot;The Tomb of Queen Tiyi&quot;. As possible reasons for this initial identification the (typical female) position of the mummy&#x27;s arms, post-mortem damage to the pelvic bones and the absence of male genitalia have been suggested. But when anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith examined the skull and bones in Cairo a few months later he concluded that they were those of a young male, with wide hips, a pendent chin, and distorted cranium brought on by chronic hydrocephalus. The age of death he estimated as being around 25 years although he later suggested the possibility that the body had suffered from Frölich&#x27;s syndrome which delayed normal skeletal maturation. These results were seen to support the initial claims by Weigall, Maspero and Smith, based on other evidence found in the tomb (see above) that the body was that of Akhenaten.

Later re-examinations of the remains confirmed Smith&#x27;s original identification of the mummy as belonging to a young male (although with feminine traits) but pushed the estimated age of death back to around 20 years. These re-examinations also indicated that the body showed no signs of delayed maturation, and that, while the skull was of unusual shape, it was not abnormal, and showed no indication of hydrocephalus. Reconstruction of the facial features of the skull also indicated that the mummy&#x27;s face in life bore no particular resemblance to Akhenaten&#x27;s representation on his monuments. However, as Akhenaten&#x27;s depictions were highly stylised, the lack of similarity is not conclusive. After the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, a close resemblance was noted between his mummy and the body found in KV55 and later tests showed both shared the same blood-group (A2) and serum antigen (MN), all of which suggests Tutankhamun and the individual found in KV55 were closely related to each other, either as father and son, or brothers. Based on these results it was concluded that the KV55 body was too young to be Akhenaten and they were seen to support the claim that the mummy was that of Smenkhkare, an idea first proposed by Rex Engelbach in 1931.

Before February 2010, it was pointed out that the reliability of methods to assess the age of death for mummies in general was uncertain. For these reasons the correctness of the age estimates was repeatedly called into question. Several studies estimated the mummy to be of a man who died around age 25–26; beside Smith, Douglas E. Derry and Ronald G. Harrison came to this conclusion. John R. Harris in the late 1980s offered 35 years as its age, while Joyce Filer in the early 2000s suggested early 20s. Elsewhere, an analysis of the skeletal remains based on dentition and X-rays of the long bones indicated 35 years. Finally, examinations using CT scans from the late 2000s, published in 2010 and 2016, showed the mummy to have died between age 35–45, which the examiners believe supports the theory that the mummy is Akhenaten&#x27;s. The archaeological, inscriptional, and now genetic evidence indicate that the ancient Egyptians who buried (and later desecrated) the body in KV55 believed this to be Akhenaten&#x27;s. However, a number of experts dispute these findings, claiming that Hawass et al. have not provided sufficient evidence to assume the older age at death. In fact, the original 2010 paper only cites a single point of spinal degeneration, while other analyses, such as Strouhal&#x27;s cite multiple indicators for a younger age.

Further complicating the identity of the KV55 mummy is the fact that he does not seem to be the father of the female mummy KV21a. The latter has been identified as a likely candidate for the mother of two foetuses found in Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, thus probably making her Ankhesenamun, the daughter of Akhenaten and the only known wife of Tutankhamun. The identity of the KV55 mummy, therefore, remains controversial for many.

In March 2021, the results of a new forensic facial reconstruction were released.

===Reconstruction===

The deposit, as it was found in KV55, presents a mixture of chronological and religious anomalies. Objects inscribed with Amenhotep III&#x27;s nomen and prenomen might be contemporary with that king&#x27;s reign and could be interpreted as possessions of Queen Tiye. Other items inscribed with Tiye&#x27;s name (such as the shrine and furniture elements) also clearly belonged to her. Akhenaten&#x27;s presence is indicated by items originally inscribed for him (such as the magical bricks) and items that were adapted for his use (such as the coffin and canopic jars).

It is nevertheless highly unlikely that either of these two burials within KV55 was original. In the case of Tiye, evidence found in tomb WV22 suggests that Amenhotep III prepared her burial in his own tomb. However, the fact that Tiye outlived her husband by possibly as much as twelve years seems to have disrupted such plans. On the other hand, from inscriptional evidence on the KV55 shrine, it seems likely that Tiye was buried at Amarna by her son Akhenaten. In the case of Akhenaten, it seems almost certain that he was originally buried in the tomb he prepared for himself in the Amarna royal wadi. Although it is unclear whether or not the original blocking of the tomb was stamped with Tutankhamun&#x27;s seal, the several small seal-impressions carrying his prenomen are most likely related to the reburial(s) in KV55, since he was probably not involved in the original burial preparations of either Tiye (who died several years before Tutankhamun came to the throne) or Akhenaten (who, presumably, was buried by his co-regent and probable immediate successor, Smenkhkare).

One scenario, suggested by Nicholas Reeves, is as follows: Akhenaten and his mother, Queen Tiye, were originally entombed in the Royal Tomb at Akhenaten&#x27;s new capital Akhetaten (modern Amarna), but their mummies were moved to KV55 following the total abandonment of Akhetaten during the reign of Tutankhamun, who was Akhenaten&#x27;s son. The door to KV55 was sealed with Tutankhamun&#x27;s name. There, the mummies remained for about 200 years, until the tomb was rediscovered by workmen excavating the tomb of Ramesses IX (KV6) nearby. By this time, Akhenaten was reviled as the &quot;heretic king&quot;; consequently, Queen Tiye&#x27;s sarcophagus was hastily removed from his defiling presence, except for its surrounding gilded wooden shrine, which would have had to be dismantled for removal. Akhenaten&#x27;s likeness was chiseled off the shrine&#x27;s carved relief. Moreover, the gold face mask was ripped from Akhenaten&#x27;s sarcophagus and his identifying cartouche was removed from its hieroglyphic inscription, thus consigning its occupant to oblivion. As a final insult, a large rock was thrown at the coffin. However, a finely made vulture pectoral—a symbol of royalty in Ancient Egypt—was still found placed around this mummy&#x27;s head.

==Later use of KV55==
In 1923, Harry Burton used KV55 as a darkroom to develop his photographs documenting Howard Carter&#x27;s excavation of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb.

==In literature==

The discovery and opening of KV55 is one of the events recounted in the novel &quot;The Ape Who Guards the Balance&quot; by the Egyptologist Barbara Mertz (writing as Elizabeth Peters).

<text>John Cairncross (25 July 1913 – 8 October 1995) was a British civil servant who became an intelligence officer and spy during the Second World War. As a Soviet double agent, he passed to the Soviet Union the raw Tunny decryptions that may have influenced the Battle of Kursk. He was alleged to be the fifth member of the Cambridge Five. He was also notable as a translator, literary scholar and writer of non-fiction.

The most significant aspect of his work was helping the Soviets defeat the Germans in battle during the Second World War; he may also have told Moscow that the US was developing an atomic bomb. Cairncross confessed in secret to MI5&#x27;s Arthur S. Martin in 1964 and gave a limited confession to two journalists from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in December 1979. He was given immunity from prosecution.

According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the suggestion that John Cairncross was the &quot;fifth man&quot; of the Cambridge ring was not confirmed until 1990, by Soviet double-agent Oleg Gordievsky. This was re-confirmed by former KGB agent Yuri Modin&#x27;s book published in 1994, &quot;My Five Cambridge Friends Burgess, Maclean, Philby, Blunt, and Cairncross by Their KGB Controller&quot;.

==Childhood and education==

Cairncross was born at Pine Cottage, Lesmahagow, in Lanarkshire, the youngest of four girls and four boys, of Elizabeth Andrew Wishart (1875–1958), a primary schoolteacher, and Alexander Kirkland Cairncross (1865–1947), an ironmongery manager. His three brothers became professors, one of whom was the economist Sir Alexander Kirkland Cairncross (a.k.a. Alec Cairncross). The journalist Frances Cairncross is his niece. Cairncross grew up in Lesmahagow, a small town on the edge of moorland, near Lanark in the Central Belt of Scotland, and was educated at Lesmahagow Higher Grade School (where his name appears as the 1928 winner of the Dux prize); Hamilton Academy; the University of Glasgow; the Sorbonne; and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied French and German.

== Early professional work ==

After graduating, Cairncross took the British Civil Service exam and won first place in both the &quot;home civil service&quot; and the &quot;foreign office and diplomatic service&quot; competitions. An article in the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; on 29 September 1936 noted that Cairncross had scored an &quot;outstanding double success of being placed 1st in the Home List and 1st in the competition for the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Service&quot; and that he had been placed fifth in the University of Glasgow bursary competition of 1930 and was also a Scholar and Bell Exhibitioner at Trinity College, Cambridge.

Cairncross worked initially in the Foreign Office before transferring to the Treasury and then the Cabinet Office, where he worked as a private secretary to Lord Hankey, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. It has been suggested that in 1936, whilst at Cambridge, Cairncross joined the Communist Party of Great Britain but he was not noted whilst at university for any political activity by his brother Alec, who was also at Cambridge until 1935. Sir Alec also recalled that John &quot;was a prickly young man, who was difficult to argue with and resented things rather easily&quot;.

It was while he was working with the Foreign Service () that he was recruited as a spy for the Soviets by James Klugmann of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

== Second World War ==
In 1942 and 1943 Cairncross worked at GC&amp;CS, Bletchley Park in Hut 3, on Ultra ciphers. He had access to communications of the German military and intelligence services. In June 1943, he left Bletchley Park for a job in MI6.

=== Government Code and Cypher School, Bletchley Park ===

Cairncross passed decrypted documents through secret channels to the Soviet Union. Codenamed &quot;Liszt&quot; by the Russians because of his love of music, Cairncross had been instructed to get into Bletchley Park, known to the KGB as &quot;Kurort&quot;.

From 1942, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German Armed Forces High Command) communicated with Army group commanders in the field using a machine that the British codenamed Tunny. Cairncross smuggled &quot;Tunny&quot; decrypts due to be destroyed out of Hut 3 in his trousers, transferring them to his bag at the railway station before going to meet his NKVD contact in London, Anatoli Gorsky. The Soviets were particularly interested in traffic between Berlin–Pskov, Berlin–Helsinki, Berlin–Lisbon, Trebizond–Istanbul, Berlin–Bucharest, and Kirkenes–Oslo. They were also interested in British efforts to decipher Soviet ciphers and in the joint effort by German and Japanese cipher experts to decipher Soviet signals including military ones, which the combined German–Japanese effort failed to achieve with the Soviet diplomatic ciphers.

The raw transcripts decrypted by Colossus were passed to intelligence officers at Bletchley Park, who created reports based on this material by disguising its origin as signals traffic. By providing verbatim transcripts, Cairncross showed the Soviets that the British were breaking German ciphers. It was considered to be in the British interest for the Soviet Union to be made aware of German military plans, but not of how they were obtained, because of &quot;defective and leaky&quot; internal security in the Soviet Union. The Lubianka originally suspected a &quot;trap&quot; because of the amount of high-grade material supplied, but it was acted on and found to be accurate. One item passed was &quot;advance warning to develop tanks with stronger shells in the light of German armament reports. Information based on decrypts was passed to the Soviets through official channels as from Agent &quot;Boniface&quot;. Stalin distrusted unsourced intelligence presented to him by Britain and the United States.

==== Operation Citadel ====
Operation Citadel was the codename given by Nazi Germany to their offensive which led to the Battle of Kursk. After being defeated at Kursk, the Wehrmacht retreated steadily until Berlin was taken. Tunny decrypts (transcripts) gave the British advance intelligence about Operation Citadel. Almost all raw transcripts were destroyed at the end of the war but a surviving transcript dated 25 April 1943 from Army Group South signed by Maximilian von Weichs shows the high level of detail available to British intelligence officers. Analysts deduced the northern and southern attack routes, and a report based on this transcript was passed through official channels to Stalin. During this period, Cairncross provided a second, clandestine channel, supplying raw Tunny transcripts directly.

==== Tito and the Yugoslav partisans ====
Axis occupation forces in Yugoslavia used radio communication extensively. In addition to German Abwehr, Sicherheitsdienst (SD), Luftwaffe, naval, railway, Army group and OKW messages, GC&amp;CS intercepted and decrypted Yugoslav partisan communications with Comintern and with the Soviet Union. Cairncross first in Hut 3, then later at MI6 HQ, had access to raw decrypts. Communications from Comintern to Tito supplying some of this intelligence, strongly suggest that he passed decrypts concerning Yugoslavia to the KGB.

==As a spy==
Between 1941 and 1945, Cairncross supplied the Soviets with 5,832 documents, according to Russian archives. In 1944, Cairncross joined MI6, the foreign intelligence service. In Section V, the counter-intelligence section, Cairncross produced under the direction of Kim Philby an order of battle of the SS. Cairncross later suggested that he was unaware of Philby&#x27;s connections with the Russians. In October 1944, he wrote to his Soviet leaders in foreign intelligence &quot;I am delighted that our friends found my help worthy of attention, and I am proud that I contributed something to the victory, which led to the almost complete cleansing of the Soviet land from the invaders&quot;. In March 1945, he was awarded a £1,000 per year pension but he refused to accept it.

Yuri Modin, the Russian MGB (later KGB) Controller in London, claims that Cairncross gave him details of nuclear arms to be stationed with NATO in West Germany. He gives no date for this message. Cairncross was at the Ministry of Supply in 1951 and NATO was established in April 1949. There was no such plan at this time and it was only much later that NATO obtained tactical nuclear weapons under US control in Germany. This appears to have been a disinformation exercise.

In September 1951, he was questioned by British counterintelligence about his relationship with Maclean and the Communist Party. Cairncross had been trained by the Soviets on how to behave during a counterintelligence interrogation. On 23 October 1951, Cairncross informed his Soviet controller that he had merely explained to the interrogator that he did not hide his membership with the party and that he would merely greet Maclean when he worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but did not maintain any contact with him after graduation. For security, the residence (or rezidentura, the local Soviet intelligence station) temporarily stopped contact with him, allowed him to continue to report monthly his situation with appropriate signals, and planned a follow-up meeting on 23 January 1952. The Soviets developed an exfiltration plan for Cairncross including funds, documents, and communication methods while living in other countries. Cairncross did not signal his controller until an early March 1952 meeting during which Cairncross stated that he had been interrogated again. The residency did not have any more contact with Cairncross and instructed Kim Philby to determine Cairncross&#x27;s whereabouts. Philby could not determine the whereabouts of Cairncross.

Cairncross admitted to some impropriety in 1951 after MI5 found papers in Guy Burgess&#x27;s flat with a handwritten note from him, after Burgess&#x27;s flight to Moscow. This included a 15-page report about international affairs and policy obtained from nine officials. Cairncross claimed that this was the only document that he had ever provided to Burgess. No evidence of his spying for the Soviets during the war was produced. The official report concluded that the interrogations in 1951 and 1952 had &quot;failed to produce evidence on which a charge of espionage could be based&quot;. Philby had also informed the residency of this.

Evidence from the Soviet archives strongly indicates that Cairncross supplied to his Soviet handlers early information about British intentions to develop an atomic weapons programme. In September 1940 Cairncross was assigned to the office of Maurice Hankey, a minister without portfolio who sat on numerous scientific committees including the MAUD Committee and later the Tube Alloys Consultative Committee. While this did not include technical data, it provided the Soviet Union evidence that the British were considering the production of atomic weapons. He was never prosecuted, which later led to charges that the government engaged in a conspiracy to cover up his role.

The identity of the infamous &#x27;fifth man&#x27; in the Cambridge Five remained a mystery outside intelligence circles until 1990, when KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky confirmed Cairncross publicly. Cairncross worked independently of the other four and did not share their upper-middle-class backgrounds or tastes. Although he knew Anthony Blunt at Cambridge, Guy Burgess socially (and had a dislike of both of them), Donald Maclean from the Foreign Office and Kim Philby from MI6, he claimed not to have been aware that they were also passing secrets to the Russians.

Cairncross had resigned from the civil service in late 1952 and forfeited his pension. In 1964, he admitted to interrogator Arthur Martin that he had spied for the Soviets. In December 1979, Cairncross was approached by journalist Barrie Penrose and confessed to him. The news was widely publicized leading many to surmise that he was in fact the &quot;fifth man&quot;, a designation which would be confirmed in 1989 by Gordievsky, who had defected to Britain.

While Cairncross is now widely considered to be the &quot;fifth man&quot;, a few sources previously believed that the designation should go to Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild. In his 1994 book &quot;The Fifth Man&quot;, Roland Perry asserted this claim. After the book was published, former KGB controller Yuri Modin denied ever having named Rothschild as &quot;any kind of Soviet agent&quot;. Modin&#x27;s own book&#x27;s title clarifies the name of the fifth man: &quot;My Five Cambridge Friends: Burgess, Maclean, Philby, Blunt, and Cairncross&quot;.

Cairncross did not view himself as one of the Cambridge Five, insisting that the information he sent to Moscow was not harmful to Britain and that he had remained loyal to his homeland. He believed that he had been doing a favour to an ally who was being refused information by a &quot;right-wing clique&quot;, according to one news item. His link to the Cambridge ring is tenuous since his truly valuable spy work had concluded by the end of the war. A review of the 2019 book by Chris Smith, &quot;The Last Cambridge Spy: John Cairncross, Bletchley Park Codebreaker and Soviet Double Agent&quot;, proposes this view. The review adds that unlike the other four, described as &quot;privileged&quot; and as &quot;haute bourgeois&quot; by another book (&quot;A Spy Named Orphan: The Enigma of Donald Maclean&quot;), he was &quot;lower middle class&quot; with a heavy Scottish accent. &quot;It was mere happenstance that he was at Cambridge with the others&quot;.

==Later life==
At the end of the war, Cairncross joined the Treasury; he claimed that he ceased working for the MGB (later to become the KGB). KGB reports, published subsequently, contradict this. After his first confession (1952), Cairncross lost his civil service job and was penniless and unemployed. With some financial assistance from his previous handler, Modin, he moved to the US, where he taught at universities in Chicago and as a lecturer in Romance Languages at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Cairncross was an expert on French authors and translated the works of many 17th century French poets and dramatists such as Jean Racine, Jean de La Fontaine and Pierre Corneille, as well as writing three of his own books, &quot;Molière bourgeois et libertin&quot;, &quot;New Light on Molière&quot; and &quot;After Polygamy was Made a Sin&quot;.

This career was ended following further investigation into Cairncross by MI5 investigative officer Arthur S. Martin. After Philby fled to Moscow in 1963, Martin reopened the files to hunt for the fourth and fifth men in 1964. To Martin&#x27;s surprise, Cairncross made a full confession. Martin also received a denunciation which led to Blunt&#x27;s confession. Despite his confession to Martin, Cairncross was never prosecuted for his espionage activities. The confession, conducted in Cleveland, Ohio, was not made under police caution and would therefore have been inadmissible in court. Despite MI5 enquiries regarding extradition, the FBI did not view Cairncross as a danger to US security and had no grounds to deport him to Britain. MI5 asked Cairncross if he would be willing to voluntarily return to Britain to provide his confession again, this time under caution. He declined to do so.

In 1967, Cairncross moved to Rome, where he worked for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization as a translator, also taking on work for the Research Office of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), Banca d&#x27;Italia and IMI. In 1970, he moved to France and lived in Provence. In the BNL, a young economist engaged with international scenarios analysis (the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–1988, petroleum&#x27;s strategic routes in the Middle East and Far East) reported a strong and unusual interest by Cairncross in the bank&#x27;s role in that area. During his time in Rome, his secret finally reached the public. In December 1979, in the wake of the Blunt scandal, the former civil servant Jock Colville alluded to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; journalist, Barrie Penrose, that there had been another spy in the Foreign Office at the same time as Donald Maclean. After searching the Foreign Office lists, Penrose concluded that Cairncross was that spy and confronted him.

Cairncross&#x27;s third confession became front-page news. In 1981, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher informed parliament that Cairncross was a Soviet agent and was living with his wife in the west of England while he wrote his memoirs. His status as the &quot;fifth man&quot; was established in 1990 by Oleg Gordievsky, the KGB defector. Cairncross retired to the south of France until 1995 when he returned to Britain and married American opera singer Gayle Brinkerhoff, daughter of John Brinkerhoff. This was one month after his first wife whom he married in 1951, Gabriella Oppenheim, died. Later that year he died after suffering a stroke, at the age of 82. Unlike many other spies, Cairncross was never charged with criminally passing information to Moscow. His only imprisonment was in Rome, after being convicted of charges involving currency.

Cairncross&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Enigma Spy&quot;, was published in 1997. In 2001, writer Rupert Allason lost a court case in which he claimed to have ghostwritten &quot;The Enigma Spy&quot; in return for copyright and 50% of the book proceeds. According to the BBC, &quot;John Cairncross denied both that he was the supposed &#x27;fifth man&#x27; and that such a person had ever existed. Critics at the time viewed this book as a last attempt to clear his name, though few appear to have been convinced&quot;.

Cairncross corresponded with novelist Graham Greene for forty years and that correspondence is held by the John J. Burns Library, at Boston College.

==Cultural representations==
Cairncross is depicted in part three of the 2003 BBC TV series &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot;, where he appears reluctant to continue passing Bletchley Park data to the Russians for fear that the Red Army was heavily penetrated by Abwehr (German intelligence) and by Eastern Front military intelligence under General Gehlen. Anthony Blunt is depicted in the drama as pressuring him with threats. 

Cairncross appears as a cryptographer at Bletchley Park in the 2014 film &quot;The Imitation Game,&quot; played by Allen Leech. He is portrayed as an unwitting double agent being used as a back-channel by MI6 to pass information to the Soviets that Churchill is too cautious to provide; no historical basis for this is provided. Historians, and the spy&#x27;s own autobiography, have confirmed that Cairncross was spying for the Soviets because of his own views, and that this was not discovered by MI6 until long after the end of WWII.

<text>Smenkhkare (alternatively romanized Smenkhare, Smenkare, or Smenkhkara; meaning &quot;Vigorous is the soul of Re&quot;) was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of unknown background who lived and ruled during the Amarna Period of the 18th Dynasty. Smenkhkare was husband to Meritaten, the daughter of his likely co-regent, Akhenaten. Since the Amarna period was subject to a large-scale condemnation of memory by later pharaohs, very little can be said of Smenkhkare with certainty, and he has hence been subject to immense speculation.

== Origin and family ==
Smenkhkare&#x27;s origins are unknown. It is assumed he was a member of the royal family, likely either a brother or son of the pharaoh Akhenaten. If he is Akhenaten&#x27;s brother, his mother was likely either Tiye or Sitamun. If a son of Akhenaten, he was presumably an older brother of Tutankhamun, as he succeeded the throne ahead of him; his mother was likely an unknown, lesser wife. An alternative suggestion, based on objects from the tomb of Tutankhamun, is that Smenkhkare was the son of Akhenaten&#x27;s older brother, Thutmose and an unknown woman, possibly one of his sisters.

Smenkhkare is known to have married Akhenaten&#x27;s eldest daughter, Meritaten, who was his Great Royal Wife. Inscriptions mention a King&#x27;s Daughter named Meritaten Tasherit, who may be the daughter of Meritaten and Smenkhkare. Furthermore, Smenkhkare has been put forth as a candidate for the mummy in KV55. If so, he would be the father of Tutankhamun.

==Reign as pharaoh==
=== Length of reign ===
Clear evidence for a sole reign for Smenkhkare has not yet been found. There are few artifacts that attest to his existence at all, and so it is assumed his reign was short. A wine docket from &quot;the house of Smenkhkare&quot; attests to Regnal Year 1. A second wine docket dated to Year 1 refers to him as &quot;Smenkhkare, (deceased)&quot; and may indicate that he died during his first regnal year.

Some Egyptologists have speculated about the possibility of a two- or three-year reign for Smenkhkare based on a number of wine dockets from Amarna that lack a king&#x27;s name but bear dates for regnal years 2 and 3. However, they could belong to any of the Amarna kings and are not definitive proof either way.

=== Smenkhkare Hall ===
While there are few monuments or artifacts that attest to Smenkhkare&#x27;s existence, there is a major addition to the Amarna palace complex that bears his name. It was built in approximately Year 15 and was likely built for a significant event related to him.

== Theories of timing of Smenkhkare&#x27;s reign ==
Academic consensus has yet to be reached about when exactly Smenkhkare ruled as pharaoh and where he falls in the timeline of Amarna. In particular, the confusion of his identity compared to that of Pharaoh Neferneferuaten has led to considerable academic debate about the order of kings in the late Amarna Period. Aidan Dodson suggests that Smenkhkare did not have a sole reign and only served as Akhenaten&#x27;s co-regent for about a year around Regnal Year 13. However, James Peter Allen depicts Smenkhkare as successor to Neferneferuaten and Marc Gabolde has suggested that after Smenkhkare&#x27;s reign, Meritaten succeeded him as Neferneferuaten.

=== Co-regency with Akhenaten ===
Per Dodson&#x27;s theory, Smenkhkare served only as co-regent with Akhenaten and never had an individual rule and Nefertiti became co-regent and eventual successor to Akhenaten. Smenkhkare and Meritaten appear together in the tomb of Meryre II at Amarna, rewarding Meryre. There, Smenkhkare wears the khepresh crown, however he is called the son-in-law of Akhenaten. Further, his name appears only during Akhenaten&#x27;s reign without certain evidence to attest to a sole reign. The names of the king have since been cut out but were recorded around 1850 by Karl Lepsius. Additionally, a calcite &quot;globular vase&quot; from Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb displays the full double cartouches of both pharaohs. However, this is the only object known to carry both names side-by-side. This evidence has been taken by some Egyptologists to indicate that Akhenaten and Smenkhkare were co-regents. However, the scene in Meryre&#x27;s tomb is undated and Akhenaten is neither depicted nor mentioned in the tomb. The jar may simply be a case of one king associating himself with a predecessor. The simple association of names, particularly on everyday objects, is not conclusive of a co-regency.

=== Smenkhkare as successor to Neferneferuaten ===
Arguing against the co-regency theory, Allen suggests that Neferneferuaten followed Akhenaten and that upon her death, Smenkhkare ascended as pharaoh. Allen proposes that following Nefertiti&#x27;s death in Year 13 or 14, her daughter Neferneferuaten-tasherit became Pharaoh Neferneferuaten. After Neferneferuaten&#x27;s short rule of two or three years, according to Allen, Smenkhkare became pharaoh. Under this theory, both pharaohs succeeded Akhenaten: Neferneferuaten as the chosen successor and Smenkhkare as a rival with the same prenomen, perhaps to challenge Akhenaten&#x27;s unacceptable choice. However, a hieratic inscription discovered at the limestone quarry at Dier Abu Hinnis suggests that Nefertiti was alive in Akhenaten&#x27;s Year 16, undermining this theory. There, Nefertiti is referred to as the pharaoh&#x27;s Great Royal Wife.

Furthermore, work is believed to have halted on the Amarna tombs shortly after Year 13. Therefore, the depiction of Smenkhkare in Meryre&#x27;s tomb must date to no later than Year 13. For him to have succeeded Neferneferuaten means that aside from a lone wine docket, he left not a single trace over the course of five to six years.

=== Meritaten as successor to Smenkhkare ===
In comparison to the theories mentioned above, Marc Gabolde has advocated that Smenkhkare&#x27;s Great Royal Wife, Meritaten, became Pharaoh Neferneferuaten after her husband&#x27;s death. The main argument against this is a box (Carter 001k) from Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb that lists Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten, and Meritaten as three separate individuals. There, Meritaten is explicitly listed as Great Royal Wife. Further, various private stelae depict the female pharaoh with Akhenaten. However under this theory, Akhenaten would be dead by the time Meritaten became pharaoh as Neferneferuaten. Gabolde suggest that these depictions are retrospective. Yet since these are private cult stelae it would require a number of people to get the same idea to commission a retrospective, commemorative stela at the same time. Allen notes that the everyday interaction portrayed in them more likely indicates two living people.

==Identity and confusion over regnal name==

There has been much confusion in identifying artifacts related to Smenkhkare because another pharaoh from the Amarna Period bears the same or similar royal titulary. In 1978, it was proposed that there were two individuals using the same name: a male king Smenkhkare and a female Neferneferuaten. Neferneferuaten has since been identified as a female pharaoh who ruled during the Amarna Period and is generally accepted as a separate person from Smenkhkare. Neferneferuaten is theorized to be either Nefertiti, Meritaten, or, more rarely, Neferneferuaten Tasherit.

After their initial rediscovery, Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten were assumed to be the same person because of their similar prenomen (throne name). Typically, throne names in Ancient Egypt were unique. Thus, the use of similar titulary led to a great deal of confusion among Egyptologists. For the better part of a century, the repetition of throne names was taken to mean that Smenkhare changed his name to Neferneferuaten at some point, probably upon the start of his sole reign. Indeed, Petrie makes exactly that distinction in his 1894 excavation notes. Later, a different set of names emerged using the same: &quot;&quot;Ankhkheperure mery Neferkheperure&quot; [Akhenaten] &quot;Neferneferuaten mery Wa en Re&quot; [Akhenaten]&quot;.

Smenkhkare can be differentiated from Neferneferutaten by the lack of an epithet associated with his throne name. James Peter Allen pointed out the name &#x27;Ankhkheperure&#x27; nearly always included the epithet &#x27;desired of Wa en Re&#x27; (referring to Akhenaten) when coupled with the nomen &#x27;Neferneferuaten&#x27;. There were no occasions where &#x27;Ankhkheprure plus epithet&#x27; occurred alongside &#x27;Smenkhkare;&#x27; nor was plain &#x27;Ankhkheperure&#x27; ever found associated with the nomen Neferneferuaten. However, differentiating between the two individuals when &#x27;Ankhkheperure&#x27; occurs alone is complicated by the Pawah graffito from TT139. Here, Ankhkheperure is used alone twice when referring to Neferneferutaten. In some instances, a female version &#x27;Ankhetkheperure&#x27; occurs; in this case the individual is Neferneferuaten.

The issue of a female Neferneferuaten was finally settled for the remaining holdouts when Allen confirmed Marc Gabolde&#x27;s findings that objects from Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb originally inscribed for Neferneferuaten which had been read using the epithet &quot;...desired of Akhenaten&quot; were originally inscribed as &quot;Akhet-en-hyes&quot; or &quot;effective for her husband.&quot;

=== Theories ===

==== Akhenaten and Smenkhkare as homosexual couple ====
Theories arose when the two pharaohs Smenkhkare and Neferneferutaten were still considered the same, male person, that he and Akhenaten could have been homosexual lovers or even married. This is because of artwork clearly showing Akhenaten in familiar, intimate poses with another pharaoh. For example, stele in Berlin depicts a pair of royal figures, one in the double crown and the other, who appears to be a woman, in the khepresh crown. However, the set of three empty cartouches can only account for the names of a king and queen. This has been interpreted to mean that at one point Nefertiti may have been a coregent, as indicated by the crown, but not entitled to full pharaonic honors such as the double cartouche. Furthermore, it is now accepted that other artifacts similar to this one are depictions of Akhenaten and Neferneferuaten.

====Nefertiti as Smenkhkare====
Alternatively, once the feminine traces were discovered in some versions of the throne names, it was proposed that Nefertiti was masquerading as Smenkhkare and later changed her name back to Neferneferuaten. There would be precedent for presenting a female pharaoh as a male, such as Hatshepsut had done generations prior.

==Evidence==
* The Coregency Stela U.C. 410, now in the Petrie Museum. Although badly damaged, partial inscriptions survive. It shows the double cartouche of Akhenaten alongside that of &quot;Ankhkheperure mery-Waenre Neferneferuaten Akhet-en-hyes&quot; (&#x27;effective for her husband&#x27;). The inscription originally bore the single cartouche of Nefertiti, which was erased along with a reference to Meritaten to make room for the double cartouche of King Neferneferuaten.
*Line drawings of a block depicting the nearly complete names of King Smenkhkare and Meritaten as Great Royal Wife were recorded before the block was lost.
*A cartouche which was stamped on a jar handle before firing, from Tell Jerishe (Tel Gerisa) in Israel. It bears the throne name of Smenkhkare.
* Flinders Petrie documented six rings bearing only the Throne Name &#x27;Ankhkheperure&#x27; (the other six with the same Throne Name show an epithet: or Mery Neferkheperure, no. 92 and no. 93; or Mery Waenre, no. 94, 95, and 96) and two more bearing &#x27;Smenkhkare&#x27; (with another one bearing the epithet Djeserkheperu, which belonged to Smenkhkare) in excavations of the palace. One example is Item UC23800 in the Petrie Museum which clearly shows the &quot;djeser&quot; and &quot;kheperu&quot; elements and a portion of the &#x27;ka&#x27; glyph. Pendlebury found more when the town was cleared.
* A ring bearing his name is found at Malqata in Thebes.
* Perhaps the most magnificent was a vast hall more than 125 metres square and including over 500 pillars. This late addition to the central palace has been known as the Hall of Rejoicing, Coronation Hall, or simply Smenkhkare Hall because a number of bricks stamped &quot;Ankhkheperure in the House of Rejoicing in the Aten&quot; were found at the site.
* Indisputable images for Smenkhkare are rare. Aside from the tomb of Meryre II, a carved and painted relief showing an Amarna king and queen in a garden is often attributed to him. It is completely without inscription, but since they do not look like Tutankhamun or his queen, they are often assumed to be Smenkhkare and Meritaten, but Akhenaten and Nefertiti are sometimes put forth as well.
* An inscription in the tomb of Pairi, TT139, by the other Ankhkheperure (Neferneferuaten), mentions a functioning Amen &#x27;temple of Ankhkheperure&#x27;.

Several items from the tomb of Tutankhamun bear the name of Smenkhkare:

* A linen garment decorated with 39 gold daisies along with 47 other sequins bearing the prenomen of Smenkhkare alongside Meritaten&#x27;s name.
* Carter number 101s is a linen shawl with the name Ankhkheperure
* A compound bow (Carter 48h) and the mummy bands (Carter 256b) were both reworked for Tutankhamun.
* Less certain, but much more impressive is the second anthropoid coffin containing the mummy of Tutankhamun. The face depicted is much more square than that of the other coffins and quite unlike the gold mask or other depictions of Tutankhamun. The coffin is rishi style and inlaid with coloured glass, a feature only found on this coffin and one from KV55, the speculated resting place for the mummy of Smenkhkare. Since both cartouches show signs of being reworked, Dodson and Harrison conclude this was most likely originally made for Smenkhkare and reinscribed for Tutankhamun.

As the evidence came to light in bits and pieces at a time when Smenkhkare was assumed to have also used the name Neferneferuaten, perhaps at the start of his sole reign, it sometimes defied logic. For instance, when the mortuary wine docket surfaced from the &#x27;House of Smenkhkare (deceased)&#x27;, it seemed to appear that he changed his name back before he died.

Since his reign was brief, and he may never have been more than co-regent, the evidence for Smenkhkare is not plentiful, but nor is it quite as insubstantial as it is sometimes made out to be. It certainly amounts to more than just &#x27;a few rings and a wine docket&#x27; or that he &#x27;appears only at the very end of Ahkenaton&#x27;s reign in a few monuments&#x27; as is too often portrayed.

==Death and burial==

The location of Smenkhkare&#x27;s burial is unconfirmed. He has been put forward as a candidate for the mummy discovered in KV55, which rested in a desecrated rishi coffin with the owner&#x27;s name removed. It is generally accepted that the coffin was originally intended for a female and later reworked to accommodate a male. Over the past century, the chief candidates for this individual have been either Akhenaten or Smenkhkare. The case for Smenkhkare comes mostly from the presumed age of the mummy (see below) which, between ages 18 and 26 would not fit Akhenaten who reigned for 17 years and had fathered a child near by his first regnal year. There is nothing in the tomb positively identified as belonging to Smenkhkare, nor is his name found there. The tomb is certainly not befitting any king, but even less so for Akhenaten.

In 1980, James Harris and Edward F. Wente conducted X-ray examinations of New Kingdom Pharaoh&#x27;s crania and skeletal remains, which included the supposed mummified remains of Smenkhkare. The authors determined that the royal mummies of the 18th Dynasty bore strong similarities to contemporary Nubians with slight differences.

Initial studies conducted on the KV55 mummy indicated that the individual was a young man with no apparent abnormalities in his mid-twenties or younger. Another study used craniofacial analysis and examined past x-rays on several 18th Dynasty mummies. That study found close cranial similarities between the mummies of Tutankhamun, KV55 and Thutmose IV. In addition, seriological tests published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1974 indicated that the KV55 mummy and Tutankhamun shared the same rare blood type. This information led Egyptologists to conclude that the KV55 mummy was either the father or brother of Tutankhamun. A brother seemed more likely since the age would only be old enough to plausibly father a child at the upper extremes.

However, the academic debate was believed concluded following a 2010 genetic study performed by Zahi Hawass that determined that the parents of Tutankhamun were likely the KV55 mummy and “The Younger Lady” mummy from KV35. Chief among the genetic results was, &quot;The statistical analysis revealed that the mummy KV55 is most probably the father of Tutankhamun (probability of 99.99999981%), and KV35 Younger Lady could be identified as his mother (99.99999997%).&quot; The study further identified the two mummies as children of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye. CT scans also performed on the KV55 mummy indicated that his age at the time of death was likely higher than previous estimates, based on the reveal of age-related degeneration in the spine and osteoarthritis in the knees and spine. These estimates placed the mummy&#x27;s age at death closer to 40 years than 25. This led to further belief that the mummy was in fact Akhenaten.

However, evidence to support the much older claim was not provided beyond the single point of spinal degeneration. Other scholars still dispute Hawass&#x27;s assessment of the mummy&#x27;s age and the identification of KV55 as Akhenaten. Where Filer and Strouhal relied on multiple indicators to determine the younger age, the new study cited one point to indicate a much older age. One letter to the &quot;JAMA&quot; editors came from Arizona State University bioarchaeologist Brenda J. Baker. The content was retold on the Archaeology News Network website and is representative of a portion of the dissent:

An examination of the KV55 mummy was conducted in 1998 by Czech anthropologist Eugene Strouhal. He published his conclusions in 2010 where he &#x27;utterly excluded the possibility of Akhenaten&#x27;:

<text>The Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, commonly known as ADM, is an American multinational food processing and commodities trading corporation founded in 1902 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. The company operates more than 270 plants and 420 crop procurement facilities worldwide, where cereal grains and oilseeds are processed into products used in food, beverage, nutraceutical, industrial, and animal feed markets worldwide.

ADM ranked No. 35 in the 2023 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest United States corporations.

The company also provides agricultural storage and transportation services. The American River Transportation Company along with ADM Trucking, Inc., are subsidiaries of ADM.

ADM has been the subject of significant media attention and infamy over the years with its various scandals, one inspiring a novel and subsequent film &quot;The Informant!.&quot;

== History ==

===Early history===
In 1902, John W. Daniels started a linseed crushing business in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
George A. Archer joined the operation the next year, and in 1905 the firm&#x27;s name officially became the Archer-Daniels Linseed Company. In 1923, Archer-Daniels Linseed Company acquired Midland Linseed Products Company and then incorporated as the Archer Daniels Midland Company. The new corporation had total assets exceeding $11 million and controlled just over a third (35%) of the total linseed mill capacity within the United States.

In 1924, ADM was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. A series of acquisitions over the next several years expanded the company&#x27;s oil processing capabilities and agricultural operations, and a grain division was established in 1927. In 1930, ADM purchased control of the flour milling company Commander-Larabee Corp., which was capable of producing 32,000 barrels of flour per day. In 1934 the company began operating its first continuous solvent extraction plant in Chicago, Illinois and could now produce soybean oil. The rapid development of similar extraction plants soon followed.

By 1952, Archer Daniel Midland&#x27;s workforce had expanded to 5,000 employees, and by 1952 the company was operating overseas and manufacturing over 700 products.

In 1962, the company acquired a trademark for &quot;ADM&quot; and began referring to itself by those initials. In 1965, ADM registered the original patent for textured vegetable protein and began producing the soy flour product at its Decatur East Plant by 1966.

In 1966, Dwayne Andreas and his brother Lowell Andreas became minority shareholders in ADM. In 1969, ADM relocated its headquarters from Minneapolis to Decatur, Illinois, a location closer to the company&#x27;s soybean processing operations. At this time, it was already considered one of the world&#x27;s largest agribusiness company, with a labor force of more than 24,000 employees.

===Dwayne Andreas period (1970–1997)===

Dwayne Andreas was named CEO of ADM in 1970, and two years later was elected chairman of the company&#x27;s board. Under his leadership, Archer Daniels Midland acquired many smaller agricultural companies and expanded into international markets, eventually becoming one of the world&#x27;s largest agricultural processing companies. During this period, the company&#x27;s soybean exports increased from $1.5 billion to $7 billion. 

In 1974, ADM made its first expansion into Europe and South America when the company acquired soybean plants in Holland and Brazil. 

In 1982, ADM established international grain operations when it purchased a portion of Toepfer International, a Germany-based grain trading firm. 

In 1989, ADM purchased Collingwood Grain Inc. based in Hutchinson Kansas, adding 48 million bushels of grain storage at 36 terminal elevators. 
Dwayne Andreas stepped down from his position as CEO in 1997 and was succeeded by his nephew G. Allen Andreas. The transition occurred a year after the company pleaded guilty to price-fixing.

===2001–present===

In 2001, Paul B. Mulhollem became the company&#x27;s president. In December 2001, ADM completed the first U.S. commercial sale to Cuba since the embargo was imposed in October 1960. The next year
ADM sponsored a major agribusiness show in Havana, where the company signed a $10 million contract with Cuba’s food import agency, Alimport, to deliver rice, cooking oil, and soy.

In March 2006, G. Allen Andreas announced he was stepping down as CEO. Later, in May 2006, Patricia A. Woertz became the company&#x27;s chief executive officer. In February 2007, Woertz was elected chairman of the board at ADM.
In 2012, the company sought to acquire strategic holdings to support serving Asian markets through the acquisition of GrainCorp, an Australian grain firm with a network of storage and port facilities in Australia. On November 28, 2013, the acquisition was blocked by the Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey after Australia&#x27;s Foreign Investment Review Board failed to reach a consensus recommendation.

The company moved its headquarters to Chicago in 2014. 

That same year, ADM completed its acquisition of Toepfer International, Germany&#x27;s largest grain trader, and renamed the company ADM Germany GmbH. The company also announced that it would buy Swiss-German natural ingredient company Wild Flavors for $3 billion, a move aimed at expanding ADM into health-oriented food sectors.

ADM announced the appointment of current CEO Juan R. Luciano on November 5, 2014. Luciano initially joined the company in 2011 as chief operating officer. Under Luciano&#x27;s leadership, the company restructured its business segments and pursued an aggressive strategy of acquisitions that expanded its human and animal nutrition business.
In October 2015, ADM announced the sale of its global cocoa business to Olam International. The sale was valued at about $1.2 billion. Approximately 1,500 employees transferred to Olam with the sale. In January 2017, ADM agreed to sell its crop risk services (insurance) unit to Validus Holdings for $127.5 million. 

In October 2016, ADM launched its venture capital arm, ADM Ventures, which focused initially on alternative proteins.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in January 2018 that ADM had approached Bunge Ltd. about a takeover, with details &quot;unclear&quot; at the time. At that point, Bunge had a market value of about $9.8 billion, and was also being pursued by Glencore PLC for acquisition, since May 2017. In January 2019, Juan Luciano clarified the company didn&#x27;t need a &quot;monster transformational transaction&quot; and a deal was never made.

In March 2018, ADM restructured its business segments into four units: carbohydrate solutions, nutrition, oilseeds, and origination or ag services. The next year, the company announced it was consolidating the ag services and oilseed units. 

In September 2021, ADM acquired a 75% stake in four pet food companies for a total of $450 million, including PetDine, Pedigree Ovens, NutraDine, and The Pound Bakery. Later that year in November, ADM acquired Serbian soy agribusiness Sojaprotein, and completed its acquisition of Deerland Probiotics &amp; Enzymes.

In 2022, ADM saw rising profits due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the global food crisis.

== Environmental record ==

The company has been the subject of several major federal lawsuits related to air pollution. In 2001, it agreed to pay a $1.46 million fine for violating federal and Illinois clean-air regulations at its Decatur feed plant and to spend $1.6 million to reduce air pollution there. 
In 2003, the company settled federal air pollution complaints related to its efforts to avoid New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act that require pollution control upgrades when a plant is modernized. The company paid $4.5 million in penalties and more than $6 million to support environmental projects. In addition, ADM agreed to eliminate more than 60,000 tons of emissions of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and other pollutants from 42 plants in 17 states, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.

===Carbon footprint===
ADM reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending December 2022 at 15,630 Kt (-370 year over year). In April 2020, ADM announced that by 2035, the company intends to have reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 25%, and its energy intensity by 15%. 
==== Underground storage ====

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the economic stimulus package developed in response to the Great Recession, included a $3.4 billion allocation for the Department of Energy&#x27;s office of fossil fuel, the majority of which was slated for the Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage (ICCS) program. Through this ICCS initiative, the Department of Energy co-sponsored two large-scale capture and storage projects at ADM facilities in Illinois. These projects were intended to test the feasibility of underground disposal of carbon dioxide emissions.

In November 2011, the first of these projects, the Illinois Basin - Decatur Project (IBDP), began operation. The project involved injecting carbon captured at an ADM biofuel facility into Mount Simon Sandstone, a saline reservoir. This project was carried out by the Midwest Geological Sequestration Consortium at the University of Illinois. The Department of Energy provided $66.7 million in funding, with other funding coming from private partners.

After three years of injection, it was determined that the sandstone was accepting in an easier fashion than was originally expected. In 2017, operations began on a larger project, the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage Project (IL-CCS), which again involved injecting carbon into Mount Simon Sandstone, but this time at a different location and at a much higher volume. Whereas the first project involved injecting one million tons of carbon underground over three years, the IL-CCS project involved storing that same amount in only one year. The Department of Energy contributed $141 million to the project, while the private sector cost share amounted to over $66 million. Other partners included Richland Community College and the Illinois State Geological Survey.

In November 2020, &quot;Investigate Midwest&quot; reported that the Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage Project had not reached its milestone of one million tons stored and had only stored approximately half that amount, and that carbon emissions from the Decatur facility had actually increased from 4.2 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2016, the year before the project launched, to 4.4 million in 2019. The United States Department of Energy responded that the agency wasn&#x27;t concerned about the project reaching the stated goals, as ADM successfully demonstrated that the storage technologies work and could be utilized for future projects. 

In August 2021, ADM announced that its US flour milling operations had achieved net carbon neutral status, in part due to the Decatur capture and storage project.

In March 2023, the Decatur City Council voted unanimously to allow ADM to expand its carbon sequestration program onto city land, with the company paying the city $450 per acre of land. The agreement enabled ADM to inject liquified carbon dioxide into &quot;pore space&quot; 1.25 miles under land owned by the city of Decatur. On September 19, 2023, the EPA issued a Proposed Enforcement Order to Archer Daniels Midland Co., following a previously issued Notice of Violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Roughly 8,000 metric tons of liquid carbon dioxide and other ground fluids were leaked, equivalent to approximately three days worth of fluid injection according to ADM. According to ADM, an inspection of the facility uncovered additional anomalies, and injections were suspended pending further investigation.

==== Regenerative agriculture ====
In September 2022, PepsiCo and ADM established a partnership on regenerative agriculture projects that would increase the practice across their North American supply chains and help the companies meet carbon reduction goals. In July 2023, ADM launched an expansion of the program, which offers producers financial incentives and technical support to implement regenerative practices. As of December 2023, the company had allocated nearly 2 million acres of land within its supply chain for the program.

==Products==
Products include oils and meal from soybeans, cottonseed, sunflower seeds, canola, peanuts, flaxseed, Palm kernel, and DAG oil, as well as corn germ, corn gluten feed pellets, syrup, starch, glucose, dextrose, crystalline dextrose, high fructose corn syrup sweeteners, chocolate, ethanol, and wheat flour. End uses are consumption by people, livestock, and additives for fuel. In January 2008, ADM signed a three-year memorandum of understanding with Daimler AG and Bayer CropScience to explore the use of jatropha as a feedstock for biofuel. Natural flavors were added to ADM&#x27;s product portfolio with the 2014 acquisition of Wild Flavors and vanilla products were added through the acquisition of Rodelle in 2018. 

Long known as a food and ingredients company, it has also invested in fuel production. ADM nearly doubled capital spending in its 2007 budget to an estimated $1.12 billion. The increase is planned for bioenergy projects, focusing on bioethanol and biodiesel.

===Oilseeds processing===
The oilseeds processing segment includes global activities related to the origination, merchandising, crushing, and further processing of oilseeds such as soybeans and soft seeds (cottonseed, sunflower seed, canola, and flaxseed) into vegetable oils and protein meals.

The first quarter of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, saw the operating profit of Ag Services and Oilseeds (ADM&#x27;s biggest revenue segment) rise $422 million, or 1.2%.

===Corn processing===
ADM&#x27;s corn processing segment is engaged in corn wet milling and dry milling activities, with its asset base primarily located in the central part of the United States. The Corn Processing segment converts corn into sweeteners and starches, and bioproducts. Its products include ingredients used in the food and beverage industry including sweeteners, starch, syrup, glucose (dextrose). Dextrose and starch are used by the Corn Processing segment as feedstocks for its bioproducts operations. In 2021, ADM was ranked second on the Top 50 Global Sweetener Companies list by FoodTalks.

===Agricultural services===

ADM&#x27;s agricultural services segment uses its U.S. grain elevator, global transportation network, and port operations to buy, store, clean, and transport agricultural commodities, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, rice, and barley, and resells these commodities primarily as food and feed ingredients and as raw materials for the agricultural processing industry.

===Investor services===
ADM investor services, Inc. is a registered futures commission merchant and a clearing member of all principal commodities exchanges in the U.S. ADM Investor Services International, Ltd., a member of commodity exchanges and clearing houses in Europe, and ADMIS Hong Kong Limited, offer broker services in Europe and Asia.

==Scandals==
===Sherman antitrust violation===
In 1920 the US Department of Justice brought suit against the National Linseed Oil Trust for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Several co-defendants were named, including the Archer-Daniels Manufacturing Company. The suit alleged all of these companies were acting in collusion to raise prices, citing a spike in linseed oil costs between 1916 and 1918, when the price rose from $.50 per gallon to $1.80.

=== Price fixing ===

In 1993, the company was the subject of a lysine price-fixing investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. Senior ADM executives were indicted on criminal charges for engaging in price-fixing within the international lysine market. In a tape played at the trial, ADM&#x27;s President said that a single phrase inspired the company: &quot;Our competitors are our friends. Our customers are the enemy.&quot; Three of ADM&#x27;s top officials, including vice chairman Michael Andreas were eventually sentenced to federal prison in 1999. Moreover, in 1997, the company was fined $100 million, the largest antitrust fine in U.S. history at the time. Mark Whitacre, FBI informant and whistleblower of the lysine price-fixing conspiracy, would also find himself in legal trouble for embezzling money from ADM during his time as an informant for the FBI. In addition ADM&#x27;s 2005 annual report revealed that earlier that year the company settled a class-action antitrust suit for a payment of $400 million. &quot;The Informant&quot; is a nonfiction thriller book based on this event, which was later adapted into the 2009 film &quot;The Informant!.&quot;

=== Tax dodging ===
A noteworthy case of transfer mispricing came to light in 2011 in Argentina involving the world&#x27;s four largest grain traders: ADM, Bunge, Cargill and LDC. Argentina&#x27;s revenue and customs service began an investigation into the four companies when prices for agricultural commodities spiked in 2008 and yet very little profit for the four companies had been reported to the office. As a result of the investigation, it was alleged that the companies had submitted false declarations of sales and routed profits through tax havens or through their headquarters. In some cases, they were said to have used phantom firms to buy grain and had inflated costs in Argentina in order to reduce the recorded profits earned in the country. According to the country&#x27;s revenue and customs service, the outstanding taxes amounted to almost US$1 billion. The companies involved have denied the allegations. To date, the Argentinian tax authorities have not replied to the Swiss NGO Public Eye’s request regarding the current state of the case. In its 2018 annual report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Bunge mentioned provisions which suggest that the case is still ongoing: &quot;[A]s of December 31, 2018, Bunge&#x27;s Argentine subsidiary had received income tax assessments relating to 2006 through 2009 of approximately 1,276 million Argentine pesos (approximately $34 million), plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount of approximately 4,246 million Argentine pesos (approximately $113 million).&quot;

=== Violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ===
On December 20, 2013, the SEC announced that it had charged ADM for failing to prevent illicit payments (bribes) made by its foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the FCPA. Alfred C. Toepfer International Ukraine Ltd. (ACTI Ukraine), plead guilty in the Central District of Illinois to one count of conspiracy in violation of the anti-bribery sections of the FCPA. They agreed to pay $17.8 million in fines. The Department of Justice also entered into a non-prosecution agreement with ADM due to the company&#x27;s failure to implement a system of internal financial controls, addressing improper payments both in Ukraine and by an ADM joint venture in Venezuela. ADM agreed to pay more than $36 million to settle the SEC&#x27;s charges, bringing the total amount paid to over $54 million.

The Swiss NGO Public Eye elaborated the case.

=== Sonny Perdue land sale ===
In 2021, an investigation by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; found that ADM had sold land to incoming Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in 2017 at a fraction of its estimated value. Ethics lawyers had legal and ethical concerns about the sale, questioning whether it amounted to bribery. According to the &quot;Post&quot;, ADM &quot;sold the land at a small fraction of its estimated value just as it stood to benefit from a friendly secretary of agriculture.&quot;

=== Accounting practices ===
In 2020, ADM&#x27;s board agreed to have bonuses of senior executives tied to the nutrition segment&#x27;s success—a unit which accounts for less than 10 percent of the company&#x27;s revenue—replacing the standard practice of tying the award to adjusted earnings. In January 2023, its seven top executives collectively received shares worth about $72 million for exceeding those performance metrics.

In January 2024, ADM disclosed that the SEC requested information regarding its accounting practices at its nutrition business on &quot;intersegment transactions.&quot; ADM suspended its CFO, postponed its quarterly earnings report and annual filings, and said it was cooperating with the SEC investigation. In March 2024, FBI agents delivered grand jury subpoenas to current and former employees of ADM, authorized by officials at the U.S. attorney&#x27;s Manhattan office.

<text>Shalom Carmy (born May 1, 1949) is an Orthodox rabbi teaching Jewish studies and philosophy at Yeshiva University, where he is Chair of Bible and Jewish philosophy at Yeshiva College and an affiliated scholar at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. He is also Editor Emeritus of &quot;Tradition&quot;, an Orthodox theological journal, and formerly wrote a regular column in &quot;First Things&quot;.

A Brooklyn native, he is a prominent Modern Orthodox theologian, historian, and philosopher. He received his B.A. in 1969 and M.S. from Yeshiva University, and received his rabbinic ordination from its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, studying under Rabbis Aharon Lichtenstein and Joseph Soloveitchik. He has edited some of R. Soloveitchik&#x27;s work for publication. Carmy has written many articles on Biblical theology, Jewish thought, Orthodoxy in the 20th century and the role of liberal arts in a Torah education. He edited &quot;Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations&quot; (), “Jewish Perspectives on the Experience of Suffering” as well as several other works. He writes a regular personal column in Tradition, and contributes regularly on Jewish and general subjects to First Things and other journals. In addition to his exegetical and analytic work, Carmy&#x27;s theological contribution is distinguished by preoccupation with the way religious doctrine and practice express themselves in the life of the individual.

== Thought ==

One of Carmy&#x27;s most consequential essays has attempted to develop what he has called &quot;literary-theological approach&quot; to modern biblical scholarship, including biblical archaeology and higher textual criticism. Carmy contemplates a system of biblical study and engagement by Orthodox individuals with aspects of biblical scholarship with the ability to digest, integrate, and build upon an authentic engagement with Jewish thought and modern academic approaches to biblical literature without falling into apologetics.

&quot;[W]e assert the conviction that Bible is to be encountered as the word of God, rather than primarily as the object of academic investigation; we also refer to the authoritative presence of the interpretive tradition. The adjective literary comes to stress that understanding the word of God is not only a matter of apprehending propositions, but also of hearing them in their literary and historical context; secondarily, we are reminded that the language we use to articulate our insight is also an integral aspect of our study...&quot;

First, Carmy suggests that the Orthodox perspective on biblical literature should be integrated into the study of bible by student from the Orthodox community in entering into engagement with the academy. This outlook serves to lay the groundwork for further speculation and informs the study by the whole academy. He warns that failure to engage is not an option.

&quot;[I]f the university orientation becomes the paradigm and pattern for our study, then the quasi-critical and speculative subjects peripheral to the study of devar Ha-Shem-issues of authorship, dating, historical background and the like will inexorably work their way to the top of our syllabi. And if that is the case, then the marginality of Bible in the curriculum will necessarily be reinforced, as student and layman come to experience Tanakh not as the occasion for confrontation with God and with ourselves, but as a complex of preoccupations, a sideshow of &quot;problems,&quot; a vermiform appendix in the body politic of Torah, useless in itself, worthy of attention only when it causes pain or becomes infected.&quot;

Carmy suggests that Orthodox Bible student should understand the modern methodologies of the academy, but should balance this with an a priori reverence for scripture and simultaneously voice a respectful dissension to academic methodology&#x27;s conclusions when they are unchallenged simply because they originate from the academy where necessary. Carmy suggests that conflicts between findings of the academy and traditional scholarship cannot be simply papered over, but that &quot;so long as we believe that there is a solution, [challenging academic findings] need not affect the way we study Bible day by day.&quot; The second aspect of this approach Carmy presents as built off his interpretation of the mystic-philosophical approach of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook towards potentially problematic academic interpretations of religious literature. He asserts that we must &quot;build a palace of Torah&quot; on top of the challenges. Where appropriate, the observant scholar should assume an ability to integrate enlightening aspects of modern scholarship into formulations of Jewish Theology (Carmy assumes the Tanakh to be the core prism through which any vision of Jewish Theology must pass), but should refrain from hinging theology on any particular discovery.

Early in his teaching career he devised an imaginary television series, &quot;Police Philosopher&quot;, about a philosopher who gets involved in police cases. This is part a running theme in Carmy&#x27;s teaching where he touches on popular film or literature as an explanatory device for a given topic. Carmy has said that &quot;&quot;Police Philosopher&quot; was born the day I spied an ad in a professional journal, seeking a professor of philosophy prepared to teach at a local precinct so that the cops could get college credit without having to be on campus. Wouldn&#x27;t it be interesting if the professor got involved in police cases?&quot;

<text>Enigma is a puzzle video game based on &quot;Oxyd&quot;, and is released under the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later. &quot;Enigma&quot; continues to be very popular as an open source multi-platform derivative of &quot;Oxyd&quot; now that &quot;Oxyd&quot; is no longer maintained. The open source fangame &quot;Enigma&quot; has been praised in reviews.

&quot;Enigma&quot; is a marble game. Landscapes usually take the form of logic puzzles, although frequently, dexterity with the pointing device (the only form of input) is also required. The game is based on a traditional square grid map (2D computer graphics) and a realistic physics simulation.

&quot;Enigma&quot; is cross-platform and available for Mac OS X, GP2X, Microsoft Windows, FreeBSD and Linux (with packages available for several distributions).

==Gameplay==

&quot;Enigma&quot; consists of approximately 2500 levels, known as &#x27;landscapes&#x27;, which may be played in any order. The player controls one or more marbles using the mouse, and interacts with the landscape purely through the marble. Levels fall into two broad categories: Oxyd landscapes and Meditation landscapes. Some levels may appear to fall into one category while actually being in the other.

===Obstacle course navigation===
Apart from the introductory levels that gradually introduce the game&#x27;s mechanics to the player, each level either contains a puzzle, race, or hazards which the player must solve, win, or avoid. The player risks making the level impossible to solve or having the marble sink, fall down an abyss, or be crushed or otherwise destroyed. The challenges tax the player&#x27;s problem solving and logic skills, dexterity, patience and speed. These factors determine the overall difficulty of the level. If the player loses a marble, one of the player&#x27;s lives shown in the form of spare marbles in the inventory is lost. The level automatically restarts from the beginning when all lives are lost, with the Oxyd colours randomly shuffled again. Some levels even have mazes the player must navigate.

===Scoring system===
&quot;Enigma&quot; also contains a score system which tracks how fast the player finishes the level. When a level is completed, a &quot;personal record&quot; for the level is made. All levels have two records which the player can try to beat: PAR (derived from the golf scoring format) and World Record. PAR usually takes some quick doing to achieve and even changes with time in the newer versions. Setting a new World Record is nearly impossible even for the dedicated player except through sheer luck. World Records are usually formed by groups of very dedicated players who have mastered moving the marble quickly but precisely and know the ins and outs of each level.

Score statistics are published every month at the official website of &quot;Enigma&quot;. The most important categories are &quot;World Record Statistics&quot; and &quot;Solved Level Statistics&quot;. Due to the large number of levels and the variety of challenges involved, achieving 100% level completion is no small task. According to in-game published statistics, as of December 2010 only one person has managed 100% level completion.

==History==
The initial release of &quot;Enigma&quot; was in 2002. Development started due to a stated desire to keep the spirit of the game &quot;Oxyd&quot; alive since its publisher had decided to leave the video game market that same year. In 2007, &quot;Enigma&quot; reached stable version 1.01. Current version is 1.30.

===Development===
The landscapes are generated by scripts in the Lua programming language, making the creation of complicated landscapes relatively easy. A level editor exists. Composer of the menu music &#x27;Pentagonal Dreams&#x27; is Andrew &#x27;Necros&#x27; Sega.

&quot;Enigma&quot; does not currently support the popular cooperative two-player network games that were available with some versions of &quot;Oxyd&quot;, but most of the two-player landscapes are playable in single-player.

== Reception ==
&quot;Enigma&quot; has been praised in reviews as open source fan game and clone of &quot;Oxyd&quot;. &quot;Enigma&quot; was selected by Linux Format as &quot;HotPick&quot; in February 2007. It is included in many Linux distributions and is distributed over various freeware outlets. &quot;Enigma&quot; was downloaded alone over SourceForge between 2011 and May 2017 over 110,000 times according to their download statistic, computerbild.de counted another 30,000 downloads.

Also several video game magazines&#x27; cover disks included &quot;Enigma&quot; as part of Freeware and remake collections, for instance GameStar from June 2005.

<doc id="289974" wikidata="Q3083875" url="?curid=289974" title="Narita-san">
<text>Narita-san (成田山 &quot;Narita mountain&quot;) Shinshō-ji (新勝寺 &quot;New victory temple&quot;) is a Shingon Buddhist temple located in central Narita, Chiba, Japan. It was founded in 940 by Kanchō Daisōjō, a disciple of Kōbō Daishi. It is a lead temple in the Chisan branch (Chisan-ha 智山派) of New Shingon (Shingi Shingon 新義真言宗), includes a large complex of buildings and grounds, and is one of the best-known temples in the Kantō region. It is dedicated to Ācala (Japanese: Fudō myōō (&quot;Unmovable Wisdom King&quot;)) who is usually depicted holding a sword and rope and surrounded by flames. Often called a fire god, he is associated with fire rituals.

==Founding==
The temple was established in 940 to commemorate the victory of the forces dispatched from the Heian capital to suppress a revolt by the powerful Kantō region samurai, Taira no Masakado. The Shingon priest Kanchō accompanied the force, bringing with him an image of Acala from the Gomadō (Fire Offering Hall) of Takao-san Jingo-ji in Kyōtō. Shingon founder Kōbō Daishi himself was said to have carved the image and used it in Goma sacred fire rituals that helped stop a rebellion during his era. The rebellion in 940 also came to an end just as Kanchō completed a three-week Goma ritual with the same image.

According to legend, the image of Acala became too heavy after the victory to move back to its home base, so a new temple on Narita-san, named Shinshō-ji (New Victory Temple), was built to enshrine it on the spot. The temple maintains that the original image is enshrined in the Main Hall, where it is displayed on special occasions, but art historians date the current image to no earlier than the 13th century.

==Expansion==
For over 600 years, Narita-san remained a remote, humble, provincial temple—until Tokugawa Ieyasu moved his capital to Edo in 1603. Ieyasu himself credited its abbot with converting him to Buddhism, and assigned the local Sakura Domain &quot;daimyō&quot; to be responsible for its upkeep. The military and political success associated with the temple may also have appealed to him, and the location of the temple, protecting the unlucky northeast approach to his new capital, corresponded to the position of the head temple of the Tendai sect, Enryaku-ji, relative to the old Heian capital of Kyoto. However, the shogunate did little to support the temple until Tokugawa Ietsuna reconstructed its Main Hall in 1655. That building now serves as a calligraphy classroom. Shingon founder Kōbō Daishi (Kūkai) was famous for his Japanese calligraphy.

But the person most responsible for promoting and enriching Narita-san was Ichikawa Danjūrō I (1660–1704), one of the most influential actors of the golden age of kabuki. Born into a wealthy merchant family with ties to the Narita area, Danjūrō relished his family&#x27;s former samurai status by playing heroic characters doing noble deeds, developing in the process a rough, manly style known as &quot;aragoto&quot;. He was also a devout Buddhist with a particular devotion to Fudō myōō, to whom he gave credit for the safe birth of his son Kuzō, who went on to become Ichikawa Danjūrō II (1688–1758). Kuzō played such a ferocious and convincing Fudō in his stage debut in 1697 that the audience responded with prayers and offerings as if they were before a temple deity. In 1703, Danjūrō I wrote and starred in another play specifically about the Fudō at Shinshō-ji, &quot;The Avatars of the Fudō of Narita Temple,&quot; whose opening was timed to coincide with the traveling exhibit (出開帳 &quot;degaichō&quot;) of sacred images from Narita-san in Edo. Danjūrō&#x27;s immense popularity and his attachment to Fudō myōō at Shinshō-ji prompted many commoners of all classes to make regular pilgrimages from Edo to Narita-san.

==Important buildings==
Several of the structures at Narita-san temple have been designated National Important Cultural Properties: the Kōmyō-dō, built in 1701 and dedicated to the Dainichi Nyorai Buddha (Vairocana), the principal image of Shingon Buddhism; the three-storied, 25-meter high pagoda built in 1712; the &quot;Niōmon&quot; main gate, built in 1830; the Shaka-dō (Shakyamuni Hall), built in 1858; and the Gaku-dō (Votive Tablet Hall), built in 1861. The Kaizan-dō (Open Mountain Hall) shrine to Kanchō Daisōjō was built in 1938, in time for the temple&#x27;s 1000th anniversary. Narita-san Park (16.5 hectares) opened in 1928, the current Great Main Hall dates from 1968, a 58-meter high Great Pagoda (Daitō) was added in 1984, and a hall dedicated to Prince Shōtoku, regarded as the father of Japanese Buddhism, was erected in 1992.
==Regular events==
Large crowds attend the major annual events at Narita-san: Oshogatsu in January, Setsubun in February, the taiko drum festival in April, firelight performances of Noh plays in May, the Gion Festival in July, Obon in August; Shichigosan in November; and the annual burning of amulets in late December. People come to Narita-san Park to view ume blossoms in the early spring and autumn leaves in the late fall. In addition, there are chantings of the Sutra of Great Wisdom (Daihannya-e) in January, May, and September; and temple fairs are held on the 1st, 15th, and 28th day of each month. Several times a day, wooden amulets are ceremonially burned in Goma rituals.

==Tourism==
Narita-san has been a favorite site for excursions and pilgrimages by citizens of the nearby metropolitan area ever since the Tokugawa shōguns moved the national capital to Edo in 1603. After nearby Narita International Airport became the primary international hub for Japanese air traffic in the late 1970s, Narita-san also began to attract increasing numbers of foreign tourists, especially those who have a long layovers in transit. The airport is just a short train ride from either JR East Narita Station or Keisei Narita Station. From each station, it is just a short walk to the temple, along picturesque streets with many small shops selling snacks and other foodstuffs, as well as good-luck charms and other souvenirs, such as Daruma dolls.

<doc id="289975" wikidata="Q15059344" url="?curid=289975" title="Duke of Hamilton">
<text>Duke of Hamilton is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, created in April 1643. It is the senior dukedom in that peerage (except for the Dukedom of Rothesay held by the sovereign&#x27;s eldest son), and as such its holder is the premier peer of Scotland, as well as being head of both the House of Hamilton and the House of Douglas. The title, the town of Hamilton in Lanarkshire, and many places around the world are named after members of the Hamilton family. The ducal family&#x27;s surname, originally &quot;Hamilton&quot;, is now &quot;Douglas-Hamilton&quot;. Since 1711, the dukedom has been held together with the Dukedom of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain, and the dukes since that time have been styled Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, along with several other subsidiary titles.

==Overview==
The titles held by the current duke of Hamilton and Brandon are:

===Peerage of Scotland===
* 16th Duke of Hamilton (created 1643)
* 13th Marquess of Douglas (created 1633)
* 16th Marquess of Clydesdale (created 1643)
* 23rd Earl of Angus (created 1389)
* 13th Earl of Angus (created 1633)

* 16th Earl of Arran and Cambridge (created 1643)
* 13th Lord Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest (created 1633)
* 15th Lord Machanshyre and Polmont (created 1639)

===Peerage of Great Britain===
* 13th Duke of Brandon, in the County of Suffolk (created 1711)
* 13th Baron Dutton, in the County of Chester (created 1711)

===Other offices and duties===

The duke of Hamilton and Brandon is the hereditary keeper of the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the official royal residence in Scotland, where he maintains large private quarters. He is also, as Lord Abernethy and in this respect successor to the Gaelic earls of Fife, the hereditary bearer of the Crown of Scotland, a role which the 15th duke performed at the inauguration of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, as did the 16th duke at the State Opening of Parliament, 30 June 2011. As Hereditary Bearer of the Crown of Scotland, the 16th Duke also placed the crown upon the coffin of Queen Elizabeth II during a service of remembrance in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral on 12 September 2022. Traditionally, the duke of Hamilton enjoys the exclusive right to remove the Scottish Crown Jewels from the City of Edinburgh. He also regularly attends sittings in the Court of Lord Lyon as a hereditary assessor, sitting on the bench beside Lord Lyon.

===Courtesy titles===
The courtesy titles used by heirs apparent are &quot;Marquess of Douglas and Clydesdale&quot; (the eldest son of the duke) and &quot;Earl of Angus&quot; (the eldest son of a marquess of Douglas and Clydesdale). No duke has had a great-grandson in direct line to the titles, but it is likely that the latter would be styled &quot;Lord Abernethy&quot; (the Lordship of Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest being the most senior available title).

Before the dukes succeeded to the Marquessate of Douglas and its subsidiary titles, the heirs apparent were styled initially &quot;Earl of Arran&quot; (which had previously been used as a courtesy title by the marquesses of Hamilton) and later &quot;Marquess of Clydesdale&quot; (the former style then being adopted for a grandson in direct line). The heir apparent to the Earldom of Lanark (before that title merged with the dukedom) was styled &quot;Lord Polmont&quot;.

===Multiple dukedoms===
The duke of Hamilton and Brandon is one of only five British peers to hold more than one dukedom, the others being:
* the Prince of Wales (who is Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, and Duke of Cambridge);
* the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry;
* the Duke of Argyll (who holds two Dukedoms of Argyll); and
* the Duke of Richmond, Lennox and Gordon

Historically, several other peers have held multiple dukedoms, including the Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne and Newcastle-under-Lyne, the Duke of Argyll and Greenwich, the Duke of Monmouth and Buccleuch and the two Dukes of Queensberry and Dover and some other mainly royal dukes.

==House of Hamilton==

===Lairds of Cadzow===

Gilbert de Hameldun is recorded as witnessing a charter confirming the gift of the church at Cragyn to the Abbey of Paisley in 1271. His ancestry is uncertain but he may have been the son of William de Hamilton (third son of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester) and Mary of Strathearn. Gilbert de Hameldun married Isabella Randolph, daughter of Thomas Randolph of Strathdon, Chamberlain of Scotland. His heir was Walter fitz Gilbert. He was governor of Bothwell Castle for the English Crown during the First War of Scottish Independence. Following the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, he gave refuge to the Earl of Hertford and other escapees, only to deliver them and Bothwell up to Edward Bruce. He then became a Bruce partisan. Sometime between 1315 and 1329, Robert the Bruce knighted him and granted him lands in Renfrewshire and the Lothians and Cadzow (present day Hamilton in Lanarkshire), including Cadzow Castle. The lands had previously belonged to John Comyn, who was murdered by Robert the Bruce.
The 1st laird of Cadzow was succeeded as the 2nd laird by his son Sir David fitz Walter. He was a supporter of King David II and fought at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross (Battle of Durham) where he was captured along with the King. His son David Hamilton, the 3rd laird, was the first to establish Hamilton as the family name. David Hamilton&#x27;s son Sir John Hamilton became the 4th laird and was, in turn, succeeded as the 5th laird by his son James Hamilton.

===Lords Hamilton and Earls of Arran===

The 5th laird was succeeded as 6th laird by his son, Sir James Hamilton, who was created a Lord of Parliament as Lord Hamilton on 3 July 1445. In early 1474, he married Princess Mary, Countess of Arran, daughter of King James II and widow of Thomas Boyd, 1st Earl of Arran. He was succeeded by his only legitimate son, James, 2nd Lord Hamilton. In 1490, then aged 15, he married the 13-year-old Elizabeth, Lady Hay, daughter of Alexander Home, 2nd Lord Home and widow of Sir Thomas Hay, Master of Yester, son and heir of John Hay, 1st Lord Hay of Yester. However, it was later discovered that Sir Thomas Hay was still alive and the marriage was annulled. The 2nd Lord married secondly Janet, Lady Livingstone, daughter of Sir David Beaton of Creich and widow of Sir Robert Livingstone of Easter Wemyss and Drumry. He became a Privy Counsellor to King James IV, and helped to arrange his marriage to Margaret, daughter of King Henry VII of England. As a reward, he was created Earl of Arran on 8 August 1503. He was succeeded by his elder son from his second marriage, James, 2nd Earl of Arran. He was Regent of Scotland between 1542 and 1554, and guardian of the young Mary, Queen of Scots. He was created Duc de Châtellerault in the Peerage of France in 1548 for his part in arranging the marriage of Queen Mary to Francis, Dauphin of France. This French Dukedom was forfeited when he switched allegiances in 1559. Emperor Napoleon III &quot;confirmed&quot; this title for the 12th Duke of Hamilton in the 19th century, but although the 12th Duke was heir male of the 2nd Earl, the legal effect of this &quot;confirmation&quot; is doubtful.

The 2nd Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, James, 3rd Earl of Arran, who had been proposed as a husband to Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1561. In 1562 he was declared insane, and in 1581 he resigned the Earldom to James Stewart of Bothwellhaugh. However, in 1586 his resignation was ruled by the Court of Session to be the act of a madman and his honours were restored.

===Marquesses and Dukes of Hamilton===

The 3rd Earl&#x27;s younger brother John Hamilton (who was styled Lord Hamilton as is traditional for the younger sons of Earls) was appointed to administer his brother&#x27;s estates. He was created Marquess of Hamilton, Earl of Arran and Lord Aven on 17 April 1599. His son, James, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton (who had been created Lord Aberbrothwick (or Arbroath) on 5 May 1608, before he succeeded) moved to England with King James VI, and invested into the Somers Isles Company, an offshoot of the Virginia Company, buying the shares of Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford. The Parish of Hamilton in the Somers Isles (now Bermuda) is named for him. Upon the death of his uncle in 1609 he succeeded as 4th Earl of Arran (of the 1503 creation) and 5th Lord Hamilton. He was also created Earl of Cambridge and Baron Innerdale in the Peerage of England on 16 June 1619.

His son, James, 3rd Marquess of Hamilton, was created Duke of Hamilton, Marquess of Clydesdale, Earl of Arran and Cambridge and Lord Aven and Innerdale on 12 April 1643, with a special remainder allowing succession through the female line should his and his brother&#x27;s heirs male fail. His son, Charles, Earl of Arran, died young and the 1st Duke&#x27;s titles passed to his younger brother, William, 2nd Duke of Hamilton, who had already been created Earl of Lanark and Lord Machanshire and Polmont on 31 March 1639. A surrender and regrant in 1650 allowed these also to be inherited by the 1st Duke&#x27;s elder daughter. Upon his death in 1651, with no further heirs in the immediate male line, the Dukedom (and the titles created with it), as well as the Earldom of Lanark (and the title created with it), passed to that daughter, Anne, 3rd Duchess of Hamilton. The 1503 Earldom of Arran and the Lordship of Hamilton became dormant, and all the other titles (the Marquessate of Hamilton, the 1599 Earldom of Arran and the Lordships of Hamilton, Aven and Aberbrothwick in the Peerage of Scotland, and the Earldom of Cambridge and the Barony of Innerdale in the Peerage of England) became extinct.

In 1656, the 3rd Duchess married William Douglas, 1st Earl of Selkirk, third son of William Douglas, 1st Marquess of Douglas. He had been created Earl of Selkirk and Lord Daer and Shortcleuch on 4 August 1646. He changed his surname to &quot;Hamilton&quot;, and on 20 September 1660 was created Duke of Hamilton, Marquess of Clydesdale, Earl of Arran, Lanark and Selkirk and Lord Aven, Machanshire, Polmont and Daer for life. In 1688, he resigned the Earldom of Selkirk and the Lordship of Daer and Shortcleuch, and those titles were regranted to his second son, with a special remainder designed to prevent them becoming merged with the Dukedom. (See Earl of Selkirk for the subsequent history of those titles, which were eventually inherited by the 12th Duke of Hamilton, becoming separated again from the Dukedom on the death of the 13th Duke in 1940).

On 9 July 1698, the 3rd Duchess resigned all her titles in favour of her eldest son, James, Earl of Arran, who thereby succeeded as 4th Duke in his mother&#x27;s lifetime (his father had died in 1694). During the lead-up to the Acts of Union 1707, the 4th Duke was the leader of the anti-union party. He was created Duke of Brandon, in the County of Suffolk, and Baron Dutton, in the County of Chester, in the Peerage of Great Britain on 10 September 1711, but was wrongfully refused a summons to the Parliament of Great Britain under that title (although he continued to sit as a Scottish representative peer). He was killed in a celebrated duel with Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun (who also died) in Hyde Park in London on 15 November 1712.
The 4th Duke&#x27;s son James, 5th Duke of Hamilton was succeeded by his son James, 6th Duke of Hamilton, and he by his son James, 7th Duke of Hamilton. In 1761, the 7th Duke&#x27;s second cousin twice removed, Archibald Douglas, 1st Duke of Douglas, died without an heir. As the Duke of Hamilton, though still using the surname &quot;Hamilton&quot;, was patrilineally a &quot;Douglas&quot; (through the 3rd Duchess&#x27;s husband), the 7th Duke became heir male of the House of Douglas and inherited the Duke of Douglas&#x27;s subsidiary titles (although not the Dukedom), succeeding as 4th Marquess of Douglas, 14th and 4th Earl of Angus and 4th Lord Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest. He died without issue and was succeeded by his brother Douglas, 8th Duke of Hamilton. He left no sons and the title passed back to his uncle, the 6th Duke&#x27;s brother, Archibald, 9th Duke of Hamilton. He was succeeded by his son Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton, and then by his son William, 11th Duke of Hamilton. The 11th Duke&#x27;s son William, 12th Duke of Hamilton (who changed his surname to &quot;Hamilton Douglas&quot;), died without a male heir, and the Dukedom passed to his fourth cousin Alfred, 13th Duke of Hamilton, who was descended from the 4th Duke of Hamilton and whose line of the family had adopted the surname &quot;Douglas-Hamilton&quot;. His son was Douglas, 14th Duke of Hamilton, who was succeeded by his son Angus, 15th Duke of Hamilton. He died in 2010, and was succeeded by his son, the current Duke, Alexander, 16th Duke of Hamilton.

=== Succession to the Dukedom of Hamilton ===

The letters patent that created the Dukedom of Hamilton contained a special remainder. It stipulated that the Dukedom should descend to:

# heirs male of the body of the grantee, failing which to
# the grantee&#x27;s brother and heirs male of the body of the grantee&#x27;s brother, failing which to
# the grantee&#x27;s eldest daughter and heirs male of her body, failing which to
# nearest heirs whatsoever of the grantee.

As the first Duke and his brother (the second Duke) both died without surviving sons, the succession has, since 1651, been governed by the third rule given, with the dukedom going to the grantee&#x27;s daughter (the third Duchess) and her heirs male.

==House of Douglas==

George Douglas, an illegitimate son of William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, was created Earl of Angus on 9 April 1389.

His descendant, William, 11th Earl of Angus, was created Marquess of Douglas, Earl of Angus and Lord Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest on 14 June 1633.

His great-grandson, Archibald, 3rd Marquess of Douglas, was created Duke of Douglas, Marquess of Angus and Abernethy, Viscount of Jedburgh Forest and Lord Douglas of Bonkill, Prestoun and Robertoun on 10 April 1703.

He died, married but childless, in 1761, at which point the Dukedom of Douglas (and the titles created with it) became extinct, but the Marquessate of Douglas, both Earldoms of Angus and the Lordship of Abernethy and Jedburgh Forest passed to his second cousin twice removed and heir male, James Hamilton, 7th Duke of Hamilton.

==Arms==

The arms of the current Duke of Hamilton and Brandon are: &quot;quarterly: 1st and 4th grand quarters: quarterly: 1st and 4th, Gules three Cinquefoils Ermine (for Hamilton); 2nd and 3rd, Argent a Lymphad with the sails furled proper flagged Gules (for Arran); 2nd and 3rd grand quarters: Argent a Heart Gules imperially crowned Or on a Chief Azure three Mullets of the first (for Douglas)&quot;.

Lord Derby is not, however, an heir to the Marquessate of Douglas and its subsidiary titles, which would pass to the heir male (a junior-line descendant of one of the Earls of Angus, as the heirs male of the body of the 3rd Duchess are the only remaining heirs male of the body of the 1st Marquess of Douglas). He is also not an heir to the Dukedom of Brandon or the Barony of Dutton, which are limited to the heirs male of the body of the 3rd Duchess.

<doc id="289978" wikidata="Q835309" url="?curid=289978" title="Tomb of Tutankhamun">
<text>The tomb of Tutankhamun (reigned ), a pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty of ancient Egypt, is located in the Valley of the Kings. The tomb, also known by its tomb number KV62, consists of four chambers and an entrance staircase and corridor. It is smaller and less extensively decorated than other Egyptian royal tombs of its time, and it probably originated as a tomb for a non-royal individual that was adapted for Tutankhamun&#x27;s use after his premature death. Like other pharaohs, Tutankhamun was buried with a wide variety of funerary objects and personal possessions, such as coffins, furniture, clothing and jewelry, though in the unusually limited space these goods had to be densely packed. Robbers entered the tomb twice in the years immediately following the burial, but Tutankhamun&#x27;s mummy and most of the burial goods remained intact. The tomb&#x27;s low position, dug into the floor of the valley, allowed its entrance to be hidden by debris deposited by flooding and tomb construction. Thus, unlike other tombs in the valley, it was not stripped of its valuables during the Third Intermediate Period ().

Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb was discovered in 1922 by excavators led by Howard Carter. As a result of the quantity and spectacular appearance of the burial goods, the tomb attracted a media frenzy and became the most famous find in the history of Egyptology. The discovery produced only limited evidence about the history of Tutankhamun&#x27;s reign and the Amarna Period that preceded it, but it provided insight into the material culture of wealthy ancient Egyptians as well as patterns of ancient tomb robbery. Tutankhamun became one of the best-known pharaohs, and some artefacts from his tomb, such as his golden funerary mask, are among the best-known artworks from ancient Egypt.

Most of the tomb&#x27;s goods were sent to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and are now in the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza, although Tutankhamun&#x27;s mummy and sarcophagus are still on display in the tomb. Flooding and heavy tourist traffic have inflicted damage on the tomb since its discovery, and a replica of the burial chamber has been constructed nearby to reduce tourist pressure on the original tomb.

==History==
===Burial and robberies===

Tutankhamun reigned as pharaoh between and 1325 BC, towards the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty during the New Kingdom. He took the throne as a child after the death of Akhenaten (who was probably his father) and the subsequent brief reigns of Neferneferuaten and Smenkhkare. Akhenaten had radically reshaped ancient Egyptian religion by worshipping a single deity, Aten, and rejecting other deities, a shift that began the Amarna Period. One of Tutankhamun&#x27;s major acts was the restoration of traditional religious practice. His name was changed from Tutankhaten, referring to Akhenaten&#x27;s deity, to Tutankhamun, honouring Amun, one of the foremost deities of the traditional pantheon. Similarly, his queen&#x27;s name was changed from Ankhesenpaaten to Ankhesenamun.

Shortly after Tutankhamun took power, he commissioned a full-size royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings, which was probably one of two tombs from the same era, WV23 or KV57. KV62 is thought to have originally been a non-royal tomb, possibly intended for Ay, Tutankhamun&#x27;s advisor. After Tutankhamun died prematurely, KV62 was enlarged to accommodate his burial. Ay became pharaoh on Tutankhamun&#x27;s death and was buried in WV23. Ay was elderly when he came to the throne, and it is possible that he buried his predecessor in KV62 in order to usurp WV23 for himself and ensure that he would have a tomb of suitably royal proportions ready when he himself died. Pharaohs in Tutankhamun&#x27;s time also built mortuary temples where they would receive offerings to sustain their spirits in the afterlife. The Temple of Ay and Horemheb at Medinet Habu contained statues that were originally carved for Tutankhamun, suggesting either that Tutankhamun&#x27;s temple stood nearby or that Ay usurped Tutankhamun&#x27;s temple as his own.

Ay was succeeded by Tutankhamun&#x27;s general Horemheb, although the transfer of power may have been contested and created a brief period of political instability. As part of the continued reaction against Atenism, Horemheb tried to erase Akhenaten and his successors from the record, dismantling Akhenaten&#x27;s monuments and usurping those erected by Tutankhamun. Future king-lists skipped straight from Akhenaten&#x27;s father, Amenhotep III, to Horemheb.

Within a few years of Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial, his tomb was robbed twice. After the first robbery, officials responsible for its security repaired and repacked some of the damaged goods before filling the outer corridor with chips of limestone. Nevertheless, a second set of robbers burrowed through the corridor fill. This robbery too was detected, and after a second hasty restoration the tomb was once again sealed.

The Valley of the Kings is subject to periodic flash floods that deposit alluvium. Much of the valley, including the entrance to Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, was covered by a layer of alluvium over which huts were later built for the tomb workers who cut KV57, in which Horemheb was buried. The geologist Stephen Cross has argued that a major flood deposited this layer after KV62 was last sealed and before the huts were built, which would mean Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb had been rendered inaccessible by the time Ay&#x27;s reign ended. However, the Egyptologist Andreas Dorn suggests that this layer already existed during Tutankhamun&#x27;s reign, and workers dug through it to reach the bedrock into which they cut his tomb.

More than 150 years after Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial, KV9, the tomb of Ramesses V and Ramesses VI, was cut into the rock to the west of his tomb. The entrance of his tomb was further buried by mounds of debris from KV9&#x27;s excavation and by the workers&#x27; huts atop that debris. In subsequent years, the tombs in the valley suffered major waves of robbery: first during the late Twentieth Dynasty by local gangs of thieves, then during the Twenty-first Dynasty by officials working for the High Priests of Amun, who stripped the tombs of their valuables and removed the royal mummies. Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, buried and forgotten, remained undisturbed.

===Discovery and clearance===

Several tombs in the Valley of the Kings lay open continuously from ancient times onward, but the entrances to many others remained hidden until after the emergence of Egyptology in the early nineteenth century. Many of the remaining tombs were found by a series of excavators working for Theodore M. Davis from 1902 to 1914. Under Davis most of the valley was explored, although he never found Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb because he thought no tomb would have been cut into the valley floor. Among his discoveries was KV54, a pit containing objects bearing Tutankhamun&#x27;s name; these objects are now thought to have been either burial goods that were originally stored in the corridor of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb, which were removed and reburied in KV54 when the restorers filled the corridor, or objects related to Tutankhamun&#x27;s funeral. Davis&#x27;s excavators also discovered a small tomb called KV58 that contained pieces of a chariot harness bearing the names of Tutankhamun and Ay. Davis was convinced that KV58 was Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb.
After Davis gave up work on the valley, the archaeologist Howard Carter and his patron George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, made an effort to clear the valley of debris down to the bedrock. Davis&#x27;s finds of artefacts bearing Tutankhamun&#x27;s name gave them reason to hope they might find his tomb. The discovery began on 4 November 1922 with a single step at the top of the entrance staircase. When the excavators reached the antechamber, on 26 November, it exceeded all expectations, providing unprecedented insight into what a New Kingdom royal burial was like.

The condition of the burial goods varied greatly; many had been profoundly affected by moisture, which probably derived from both the damp state of the plaster when the tomb was first sealed and from water seepage over the millennia until it was excavated. Recording the tomb&#x27;s contents and conserving them so they could survive to be transported to Cairo proved to be an unprecedented task, lasting for ten digging seasons. Although many others participated, the only members of the excavation team who worked throughout the process were Carter, Alfred Lucas (a chemist who was instrumental in the conservation effort), Harry Burton (who photographed the tomb and its artefacts) and four foremen: Ahmed Gerigar, Gad Hassan, Hussein Abu Awad and Hussein Ahmed Said.

The spectacular nature of the tomb goods inspired a media frenzy, dubbed &quot;Tutmania&quot;, that made Tutankhamun into one of the most famous pharaohs, often known by the nickname &quot;King Tut&quot;. In the Western world the publicity inspired a fad for ancient Egyptian-inspired design motifs. In Egypt it reinforced the ideology of pharaonism, which emphasized modern Egypt&#x27;s connection to its ancient past and had risen to prominence during Egypt&#x27;s struggle for independence from British rule from 1919 to 1922. The publicity increased when Carnarvon died of an infection in April 1923, inspiring rumours that he had been killed by a curse on the tomb. Other deaths or strange events connected with the tomb came to be attributed to the curse as well.

After Carnarvon&#x27;s death, the tomb clearance continued under Carter&#x27;s leadership. In the second season of the process, in late 1923 and early 1924, the antechamber was emptied of artefacts and work began on the burial chamber. The Egyptian government, which had become partially independent in 1922, fought with Carter over the question of access to the tomb; the government felt that Egyptians, and especially the Egyptian press, were given too little access. In protest of the government&#x27;s increasing restrictions, Carter and his associates stopped work in February 1924, beginning a legal dispute that lasted until January 1925. Under the agreement that resolved the dispute, the artefacts from the tomb would not be divided between the government and the dig&#x27;s sponsors, as had been standard practice on previous Egyptological digs. Instead most of the tomb&#x27;s contents went to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.

The excavators opened and removed Tutankhamun&#x27;s coffins and mummy in 1925, then spent the next few seasons working on the treasury and annexe. The clearance of the tomb itself was completed in November 1930, though Carter and Lucas continued to work on conserving the remaining burial goods until February 1932, when the last shipment was sent to Cairo.

===Tourism and preservation===

The tomb has been a popular tourist destination ever since the clearance process began. Sometime after the mummy was reinterred in 1926, someone broke into the sarcophagus, stealing objects Carter had left in place. A likely time for the event is the Second World War, when a shortage of security workers led to widespread looting of Egyptian antiquities. The body was subsequently rewrapped, suggesting local officials may have discovered the break-in and restored the mummy without reporting what had happened. The theft was not exposed until 1968, after the anatomist Ronald Harrison re-examined Tutankhamun&#x27;s remains.

Most tombs in the Valley of the Kings tombs are vulnerable to flash flooding. When analysing Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb in 1927, Lucas concluded that despite the moisture seepage, no significant liquid water had entered before its discovery. In contrast, since the discovery water has periodically trickled in through the entrance, and on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1991 a rainstorm flooded the tomb through a fault in the burial chamber ceiling. The flood stained the painted chamber wall and left about of standing water on the floor. Tombs are also threatened by the tourists who visit them, who may damage the wall decoration with their touch and with the moisture introduced by their breath. The mummy is also vulnerable to this kind of damage, so in 2007 it was moved to a climate-controlled glass display case that was placed in the antechamber, allowing it to be displayed to the public while protecting it from humidity and mould.

The Society of Friends of the Royal Tombs of Egypt suggested the idea of creating a replica of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb in 1988, so that tourists could see it without further damaging the original. In 2009, Factum Arte, a workshop that specialises in replicas of large-scale artworks, took detailed scans of the burial chamber on which to base a replica, while the Egyptian government and the Getty Conservation Institute launched a long-term project to assess the condition of the tomb and renovate it as needed. The replica was completed in 2012 and opened to the public in 2014; the renovation was completed in 2019.

In 2015, the Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves argued, based on Factum Arte&#x27;s scans, that the west and north walls of the burial chamber included previously unnoticed plaster partitions. That would suggest the tomb contained two previously unknown chambers, one behind each partition, which Reeves suggested were the burial place of Neferneferuaten. The Ministry of Antiquities commissioned a ground-penetrating radar examination later that year, which seemed to show voids behind the chamber walls, but follow-up radar examinations in 2016 and 2018 determined that there are no such voids and therefore no hidden chambers.

Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb is in higher demand from tourists than any other in the Valley of the Kings. Up to 1,000 people pass through it on its busiest days.

==Architecture==


Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb lies in the eastern branch of the Valley of the Kings, where most tombs in the valley are located. It is cut into the limestone bedrock in the valley floor, on the west side of the main path, and runs beneath a low foothill. Its design is similar to those of non-royal tombs from its time, but elaborated so as to resemble the conventional plan of a royal tomb. It consists of a westward-descending stairway (labeled A in the conventional Egyptological system for designating parts of royal tombs in the valley); an east–west descending corridor (B); an antechamber at the west end of the passage (I); an annexe adjoining the southwest corner of the antechamber (Ia); a burial chamber north of the antechamber (J); and a room east of the burial chamber (Ja), known as the treasury. The burial chamber and treasury may have been added to the original tomb when it was adapted for Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial. Most Eighteenth Dynasty royal tombs used a layout with a bent axis, so that a person moving from the entrance to the burial chamber would take a sharp turn to the left along the way. By placing Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial chamber north of the antechamber, the builders of KV62 gave it a layout with an axis bent to the right rather than the left.

The entrance stair descends steeply beneath an overhang. It originally consisted of sixteen steps. The lowest six were cut away during the burial to make room to maneuver the largest pieces of funerary furniture through the doorway, then rebuilt, then removed again 3,400 years later when the excavators removed that same furniture. The corridor is long and wide; the antechamber is north–south by east–west; the annexe is north–south by east–west; the burial chamber is north–south by east–west; and the treasury is north–south by east–west. The chambers range from to high, and the floors of the annexe, burial chamber and treasury are about below the floor of the antechamber. In the west wall of the antechamber is a small niche for a beam that was used for manoeuvring the sarcophagus through the room. The burial chamber contains four niches, one in each wall, in which were placed &quot;magic bricks&quot; inscribed with protective spells.

Partitions constructed of limestone and plaster originally sealed the doorways between the stairway and the corridor; between the corridor and the antechamber; between the antechamber and the annexe; and between the antechamber and the burial chamber. All were breached by robbers. Most were resealed by the restorers, but the robbers&#x27; hole in the annexe doorway was left open.

There are several faults in the rock into which the tomb is cut, including a large one that runs south-southeast to north-northwest across the antechamber and burial chamber. Although the workmen who cut the tomb sealed the fault in the burial chamber with plaster, the faults are responsible for the water seepage that affects the tomb.

==Decoration==

The plaster partitions were marked with impressions from seals borne by various officials who oversaw Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial and the restoration efforts. These seals consist of hieroglyphic text that celebrates Tutankhamun&#x27;s services to the gods during his reign.

Aside from these seal impressions, the only wall decoration in the tomb is in the burial chamber. This limited decorative programme contrasts with other royal tombs of the late Eighteenth Dynasty, in which two chambers in addition to the burial chamber often received decoration, and with the practice in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties, in which all parts of the tomb were decorated. None of the decoration is executed in relief, a technique that was not used in the Valley of the Kings until the reign of Horemheb.

KV62&#x27;s burial chamber is painted with figures on a yellow background. The north wall shows Ay performing the Opening of the Mouth ritual upon Tutankhamun&#x27;s mummy, thus legitimising himself as the king&#x27;s heir, and then Tutankhamun greeting the goddess Nut and the god Osiris in the afterlife. The east wall portrays Tutankhamun&#x27;s funeral procession, a type of image that is common in private New Kingdom tombs but not found in any other royal tomb. The south wall portrayed the king with the deities Hathor, Anubis and Isis. Part of the decoration of this wall was painted on the partition dividing the burial chamber from the antechamber, and thus the figure of Isis was destroyed by Carter when the partition was demolished during the tomb clearance. The west wall bears an image of twelve baboons, which is an extract from the first section of the Amduat, a funerary text that describes the journey of the sun god Ra through the netherworld. On three walls the figures are given the unusual proportions found in the art style of the Amarna Period, although the south wall reverts to the conventional proportions found in art before and after Amarna.



==Burial goods==

The contents of the tomb are by far the most complete example of a royal set of burial goods in the Valley of the Kings, numbered at 5,398 objects. Some classes of object number in the hundreds: there are 413 shabtis (figurines intended to do work for the king in the afterlife) and more than 200 pieces of jewellery. Objects were present in all four chambers in the tomb as well as the corridor.

The efforts of the robbers, followed by the hasty restoration effort, left much of the tomb in disarray when it was last sealed. By the time of the discovery, many of the objects had been damaged by alternating periods of humidity and dryness. Nearly all leather in the tomb had dissolved into a pitch-like mass, and while the state of preservation of textiles was highly inconsistent, the worst-preserved had turned into a black powder. Wooden objects were warped and their glues dissolved, leaving them in a very fragile state. Every exposed surface was covered with an unidentified pink film; Lucas suggested it was some kind of dissolved iron compound that came from the rock or the plaster. In the process of cleaning, restoring and removing the damaged artefacts, the excavators labeled each object or group of objects with a number, from 1 to 620, appending letters to distinguish individual objects within a group.

===Outer chambers===
The corridor may have contained miscellaneous materials, such as bags of natron, jars and flower garlands, that were moved to KV54 when the corridor was filled with limestone chips after the first robbery. Other objects and fragments were incorporated into the corridor fill, including some dropped by the thieves and others that were swept in from the outside along with the stone chips. One well-known artefact, a wooden bust of Tutankhamun, was apparently found in the corridor when it was excavated, but it was not recorded in Carter&#x27;s initial excavation notes.

The antechamber contained 600 to 700 objects. Its west side was taken up by a tangled pile of furniture among which miscellaneous small objects, such as baskets of fruit and boxes of meat, were placed. Several dismantled chariots took up the southeast corner, while the northeast contained a collection of funerary bouquets and the north end of the chamber was dominated by two life-size statues of Tutankhamun that flanked the entrance to the burial chamber. These statues are thought to have either served as guardians of the burial chamber or as figures representing the king&#x27;s &quot;ka&quot;, an aspect of his soul. Among the significant objects in the antechamber were several funerary beds with animal heads, which dominated the cluster of furniture against the west wall; an alabaster lotus chalice; and a painted box depicting Tutankhamun in battle, which Carter regarded as one of the finest works of art in the tomb. Carter thought even more highly of a gilded and inlaid throne depicting Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun in the art style of the Amarna Period; he called it &quot;the most beautiful thing that has yet been found in Egypt&quot;. Boxes in the antechamber contained most of the clothing in the tomb, including tunics, shirts, kilts, gloves and sandals, as well as cosmetics such as unguents and kohl. Scattered in various places in the antechamber were pieces of gold and semiprecious stones from a corselet, a ceremonial version of the armor that Egyptian kings wore into battle. Reconstructing the corselet was one of the most complex tasks the excavators faced. This room also contained a wooden dummy of Tutankhamun&#x27;s head and torso. Its purpose is uncertain, although it bears marks that may indicate it once wore a corselet, and Carter suggested it was a mannequin for the king&#x27;s clothes.

The annexe contained more than 2,000 individual artefacts. Its original contents were jumbled together with objects that had been haphazardly replaced during the restoration after the robberies, including beds, stools, and stone and pottery vessels containing wine and oils. The room housed most of the tomb&#x27;s foodstuffs, most of the shabtis and many of its wooden funerary models, such as models of boats. Much of the weaponry in the tomb, such as bows, throwing sticks and &quot;khopesh&quot;-swords, as well as ceremonial shields, were found here. Other objects in the annexe were personal possessions that Tutankhamun seemingly used as a child, such as toys, a box of paints and a fire-lighting kit.

===Burial chamber===

Most of the space in the burial chamber was taken up by the gilded wooden outer shrine. This shrine enclosed a wooden frame covered with a blue linen pall spangled with bronze rosettes, followed by three nested inner shrines and then a stone sarcophagus containing three nested coffins. Burial goods were placed in the narrow gaps between shrines and between the outer shrine and the chamber walls: lamps, jars, oars, fans, walking sticks and religious objects such as &quot;imiut&quot; fetishes. Each wall of the chamber bore a niche containing a brick, of a type that Egyptologists call &quot;magic bricks&quot;, because they are inscribed with passages from Spell 151 from the funerary text known as the Book of the Dead, and are intended to ward off threats to the deceased.

The decoration of the shrines, executed in relief, includes portions of several funerary texts. All four shrines bear extracts from the Book of the Dead, and further extracts from the Amduat are on the third shrine. The outermost shrine is inscribed with the earliest known copy of the Book of the Heavenly Cow, which describes how Ra reshaped the world into its current form. The second shrine bears a funerary text that is found nowhere else, although texts with similar themes are known from the tombs of Ramesses VI (KV9) and Ramesses IX (KV6). Like them, it describes the sun god and the netherworld using a cryptic form of hieroglyphic writing that uses non-standard meanings for each hieroglyphic sign. These three texts are sometimes labeled &quot;enigmatic books&quot; or &quot;books of the solar-Osirian unity&quot;.

The sarcophagus is made of quartzite but with a red granite lid, painted yellow to match the quartzite. It is carved with the images of four protective goddesses (Isis, Nephthys, Neith and Serqet), and contained a golden lion-headed bier on which rested three nested coffins in human shape. The outer two coffins were made of gilded wood inlaid with glass and semiprecious stones, while the innermost coffin, though similarly inlaid, was primarily composed of of solid gold. Within it lay Tutankhamun&#x27;s mummified body. On the body, and contained within the layers of mummy wrappings, were 143 items, including articles of clothing such as sandals, a plethora of amulets and other jewellery and two daggers. Tutankhamun&#x27;s head bore a beaded skullcap and a gold diadem, all of which was encased in the golden mask of Tutankhamun, which has become one of the most iconic ancient Egyptian artefacts in the world.

===Treasury===

In the doorway of the treasury stood a shrine on carrying poles topped by a statue of the jackal god Anubis, in front of which lay a fifth magic brick. Against the east wall of the treasury was a tall gilded shrine containing the canopic chest, in which Tutankhamun&#x27;s internal organs were placed after mummification. Whereas most canopic chests contain separate jars, Tutankhamun&#x27;s consists of a single block of alabaster carved into four compartments, each covered by a human-headed stopper and containing an inlaid gold coffinette that housed one of the king&#x27;s organs. Between the Anubis shrine and the canopic shrine stood a wooden sculpture of a cow&#x27;s head, representing the goddess Hathor. The treasury was the location of most of the tomb&#x27;s wooden models, including more boats and a model granary, as well as many of the shabtis. Boxes in the treasury contained miscellaneous items, including much of the tomb&#x27;s jewellery. A nested set of small coffins in the treasury contained a lock of hair belonging to Tiye, the wife of Amenhotep III and mother of Akhenaten, who is thought to have been Tutankhamun&#x27;s grandmother. One box contained two miniature coffins in which mummies of Tutankhamun&#x27;s stillborn daughters were interred.

===Significance===
The volume of goods in Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb is often taken as a sign that longer-lived kings who had full-size tombs were buried with an even larger array of objects. Yet Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial goods barely fit into his tomb, so the Egyptologist Joyce Tyldesley argues that larger tombs in the valley may have contained assemblages of similar size that were arranged in a more orderly and spacious manner.
The fragmentary remains of burial goods in other tombs in the Valley of the Kings include many of the same objects found in Tutankhamun&#x27;s, implying that there was a somewhat standard set of object types for royal burials in this era. The life-size statues of Tutankhamun and the statuettes of deities have parallels in several other tombs in the valley, while the statuettes of Tutankhamun himself are closely paralleled by wall paintings in KV15, the tomb of Seti II. Funerary models, such as Tutankhamun&#x27;s model boats, were mainly a feature of burials in the Old and Middle Kingdoms and fell out of favour in non-royal burials in the New, but several royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings contained them. Conversely, Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb contained no funerary texts on papyri, unlike private tombs from its era, but the existence of an excerpt of the Book of the Dead on a papyrus from KV35, the tomb of Amenhotep II, suggests that their absence in Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb may have been unusual.

No papyrus texts at all were among the burial goods—a disappointment to Egyptologists, who hoped to find documents that would clarify the history of the Amarna Period. Instead much of the value of the discovery was in the insight it provided into the material culture of ancient Egypt. Among the furniture was a foldable bed, the only intact example known from ancient Egypt. Some of the boxes could be latched with the turn of a knob, and Carter called them the oldest known examples of such a mechanism. Other everyday items include musical instruments, such as a pair of trumpets; a variety of weapons, including a dagger made of iron, a rare commodity in Tutankhamun&#x27;s time; and about 130 staffs, including one bearing the label &quot;a reed staff which His Majesty cut with his own hand.&quot;

Tutankhamun&#x27;s clothes—loose tunics, robes and sashes, often elaborately decorated with dye, embroidery or beadwork—exhibit more variety than the clothes depicted in art from his time, which consist largely of plain white kilts and tight sheaths. No crowns were found in the tomb, although crooks and flails, which also served as emblems of kingship, were stored there. Tyldesley suggests that crowns may have not been considered personal property of the king and were instead passed down from reign to reign.

Some of the objects in the tomb shed limited light on the end of the Amarna Period. A piece of a box found in the corridor bears the names of Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten and Akhenaten&#x27;s daughter Meryetaten, while a calcite jar from the tomb bore two erased royal names that have been reconstructed as those of Akhenaten and Smenkhkare. These are key pieces of evidence in attempts to reconstruct the relationships between members of the royal family and the sequence in which they reigned, although scholars&#x27; interpretations have varied greatly. The faces of Tutankhamun&#x27;s second coffin and his canopic coffinettes differ from the faces of most portrayals of him, so these items may originally have been made for another ruler, such as Smenkhkare or Neferneferuaten, and reused for Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial.

Some objects bear evidence of the shift in religious policy in Tutankhamun&#x27;s reign. The golden throne portrays Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun beneath the rays of the Aten, in the Amarna art style. The king and queen are labeled with the later forms of their names, referring to Amun rather than the Aten, but there are signs that these labels were altered after the throne was made, and the open-work arms and back of the throne bear the king&#x27;s original name, Tutankhaten. A sceptre from the annexe bears an inscription mentioning both the Aten and Amun, implying an attempt to integrate the two religious systems.

Other information about the reign is provided by wine jars, which are labeled by the year in which they were produced. Jars that are explicitly labeled as coming from Tutankhamun&#x27;s reign range from Year 5 to Year 9, while one jar from an unidentified reign is labeled Year 10 and another Year 31. The Year 31 wine probably comes from the reign of Amenhotep III, so the remaining jars suggest that Tutankhamun reigned for nine or ten years. The flowers and fruits in the funerary garlands would have been available from mid-March to mid-April, indicating that Tutankhamun&#x27;s funeral took place then. The royal annals of the Hittite Empire record a letter from an unnamed Egyptian queen, referred to as &quot;Dakhamunzu&quot;, recently widowed by the death of a pharaoh and offering to marry a Hittite prince. The dead king is most commonly thought to be Tutankhamun, and Ankhesenamun the sender of the letter, but the letter indicates the king in question died in August or September, meaning either that Tutankhamun was not the king in the Hittite annals or that he remained unburied far longer than the traditional 70-day period of mummification and mourning.

The thefts make Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb one of the most important sources for understanding tomb robbery and restoration in the New Kingdom, particularly for the early part of that period, when robberies were more opportunistic than the large-scale plundering that took place in the late Twentieth Dynasty. Many of the boxes in the tomb bear dockets in hieratic writing that list their original contents, making it possible to partially reconstruct what the tomb originally held and which items were lost. The dockets of the jewellery boxes in the treasury, for instance, indicate that about 60 percent of their contents is missing. Thieves would have prized what was valuable, portable and either untraceable or possible to disguise through dismantling or melting. Most of the metal vessels originally buried with Tutankhamun were stolen, as were those of glass, indicating that glass was a valuable commodity at the time. The robbers also took bedding and cosmetics; the theft of the latter shows that the robberies took place soon after burial, as the Egyptians&#x27; fat-based unguents would have turned rancid within a few years. One of the boxes in the antechamber contained a set of gold rings wrapped in a scarf, which Carter believed had been dropped by the thieves and placed in the box by the restorers. The unlikelihood that robbers would forget something so valuable led him to suggest they had been caught in the act. The broken objects found in the fill of the corridor all came from the antechamber, implying that the first group of thieves only had access to that chamber and that it was the second group who reached as far as the treasury.

A man named Djehutymose, apparently the official who carried out the restoration of the tomb, wrote his name on a jar stand in the annexe. The same man left a note in KV43, the tomb of Thutmose IV, recording the restoration of that tomb in Year 8 of the reign of Horemheb. These two tombs were among several in the Valley of the Kings that were robbed at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty, suggesting that political uncertainty following Tutankhamun&#x27;s death caused a weakening of security there.

===Disposition===

After the completion of the clearance in 1932, the tomb was emptied of nearly all its contents. The main exceptions were the sarcophagus, with its original lid replaced by a glass plate, and the outermost of the three coffins, in which Tutankhamun&#x27;s mummy was placed. Carter also took a handful of small artefacts from the tomb, without permission; upon his death, his heir, Phyllis Walker, discovered them and had them returned to the Egyptian government. A few items are suspected of having illicitly made their way into other collections of Egyptian antiquities, but their provenance is uncertain.

For several decades after his tomb was cleared, the overwhelming majority of Tutankhamun&#x27;s burial goods were stored at either the Egyptian Museum in Cairo or Luxor Museum. Only the most major pieces have been on display, while the rest have been in storage at one of the two sites. Selected pieces have also gone on museum exhibition tours, raising money for the Egyptian government and serving to improve its relations with the host countries. There have been several exhibitions, visiting Europe, North America, Japan and Australia, in three major phases, one from 1961 to 1967, another from 1972 to 1981, and a third from 2004 to 2013. Many exhibitions of replicas have also taken place, beginning with a set made for the British Empire Exhibition in 1924.

Beginning in 2011, the objects from the tomb were gradually transferred to the Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza. Upon its opening, the museum is planned to display all the tomb&#x27;s artefacts.

==Mummies==

When it was uncovered in November 1925, Tutankhamun&#x27;s mummy was in poor condition. The unguents that were poured over the wrappings before burial had undergone a chemical reaction that Lucas called &quot;some kind of slow spontaneous combustion&quot;, possibly caused by fungi in the tomb. As a result most of the wrappings, and even much of the tissues in the mummy, had been carbonised. Tutankhamun&#x27;s condition contrasted with the much better-preserved mummies of other New Kingdom rulers. These mummies had been removed from their plundered tombs, placed in simpler coffins and buried in two caches during the Twenty-first Dynasty, a few centuries after they were originally entombed. It is not known whether they suffered less deterioration because they were less liberally treated with unguents, or because their removal from their original coffins prevented the unguents from soaking through the wrappings.

The solidified unguents glued together Tutankhamun&#x27;s remains, his mummy wrappings and the objects on his body, forming a single mass stuck to the bottom of the inner coffin. The excavators concluded that to remove the mummy and extricate the burial goods they would have to cut it into sections, chiselling each piece out of its setting. Two anatomists, Douglas Derry and Saleh Bey Hamdi, examined the pieces as they came free before coating the fragile flesh in paraffin wax to prevent further deterioration. They determined that Tutankhamun had been close to the age of 18 when he died, and that his skull shape, closely resembling that of an unidentified royal mummy from KV55, showed he was of royal blood rather than having married into the royal family, as Egyptologists had previously believed. When the examination concluded, Carter placed the dismembered mummy on a sand tray, which he returned to the sarcophagus in the burial chamber the following year.

The mummified foetuses found in the treasury are at different stages of development, one at five months&#x27; gestation and the other at seven to nine. Their coffins do not specify names, so they are designated based on the object number of the box that contained them (317); the smaller foetus is known as 317a(2) and the larger as 317b(2). They were examined by Derry in 1932 and subsequently stored at the medical school where he worked, now part of Cairo University.

Tutankhamun&#x27;s mummy has often been analysed to see what health conditions he had, and particularly to determine his cause of death. Such efforts are often contentious, as it is difficult to distinguish damage inflicted on the body in recent times from damage Tutankhamun suffered while alive. For instance, in 1996, the Egyptologist Bob Brier suggested that fragments of bone in the skull cavity, seen in the X-rays that Harrison had taken in 1968, were a sign that Tutankhamun had died of a blow to the head and might have been murdered. The bone fragments were later found to be fragments of vertebrae that were pushed into the skull cavity during Derry&#x27;s examination. The foetuses have faced similar problems; Harrison, in 1977, said 317b(2) had Sprengel&#x27;s deformity, but a study in 2011 by the radiologist Sahar Saleem argued that the signs of deformity were actually post-mortem damage.

Both Tutankhamun&#x27;s mummy and the foetuses have undergone genetic testing. A 2010 study of the DNA of many of the mummies from the Valley of the Kings announced that the foetuses were Tutankhamun&#x27;s children by a woman whose mummy was found in KV21, who was presumed to be Ankhesenamun. However, the results of genetic studies of Egyptian mummies have been questioned by several geneticists, such as Svante Pääbo, who argue that DNA breaks down so rapidly in Egypt&#x27;s heat that remains more than a few centuries old cannot produce an analysable DNA sample.

==Replica==
The replica of the burial chamber includes copies of the wall decoration and of the sarcophagus. Both were reproduced based on highly detailed scans. The replica was presented to the Egyptian government in 2012 and installed next to Carter House, where Carter lived while working on the tomb, near the entrance to the Valley of the Kings.

<text>Scholastic Corporation is an American multinational publishing, education, and media company that publishes and distributes books, comics, and educational materials for schools, teachers, parents, children, and other educational institutions. Products are distributed via retail and online sales and through schools via reading clubs and book fairs. Clifford the Big Red Dog, a character created by Norman Bridwell in 1963, is the mascot of the company.

== Company history==
Scholastic was founded in 1920 by Maurice R. Robinson near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to be a publisher of youth magazines. The first publication was &quot;The Western Pennsylvania Scholastic&quot;. It covered high school sports and social activities; the four-page magazine debuted on October 22, 1920, and was distributed in 50 high schools. More magazines followed for Scholastic Magazines. In 1948, Scholastic entered the book club business. In the 1960s, scholastic international publishing locations were added in England 1964, New Zealand 1964, and Sydney 1968. Also in the 1960s, Scholastic entered the book publishing business. In the 1970s, Scholastic created its TV entertainment division. From 1975 until his death in 2021, Richard Robinson, son of the corporation&#x27;s founder, was CEO and president.

==Book fairs==
Scholastic Book Fairs began in 1981. Scholastic provides book fair products to schools, which then conduct the book fairs. Schools can elect to receive books, supplies and equipment or a portion of the proceeds from the book fair.

In the United States, during fiscal 2024, revenue from the book fairs channel ($541.6 million) accounted for more than half of the company&#x27;s revenue in the &quot;Total Children&#x27;s Book Publishing and Distribution&quot; segment ($955.2 million), and schools earned over $200 million in proceeds in cash and incentive credits.

In October 2023, Scholastic created a separate category for books dealing with &quot;race, LGBTQ and other issues related to diversity&quot;, allowing schools to opt out of carrying these types of books. Scholastic defended the move, citing legislation in multiple states seeking to ban books dealing with LGBTQ issues or race. After public backlash from educators, authors, and free speech advocacy groups, Scholastic reversed course, saying the new category will be discontinued, writing: &quot;It is unsettling that the current divisive landscape in the U.S. is creating an environment that could deny any child access to books, or that teachers could be penalized for creating access to all stories for their students&quot;.

Scholastic Book Fairs have been criticized for spurring unnecessary purchases, highlighting economic inequality among students, and disruption of school activities and facilities.

==Book clubs==
Scholastic book clubs are offered at schools in many countries. Typically, teachers administer the program to the students in their own classes, but in some cases, the program is administered by a central contact for the entire school. Within Scholastic, Reading Clubs is a separate unit (compared to, e.g., Education). Reading clubs are arranged by age/grade. &quot;Book club operators&quot; receive &quot;Classroom Funds&quot; redeemable only for &quot;Scholastic Corporation&quot; products.

<doc id="289984" wikidata="Q317567" url="?curid=289984" title="Barry Sonnenfeld">
<text>Barry Sonnenfeld (born April 1, 1953) is an American filmmaker and television director. He originally worked as a cinematographer for the Coen brothers before directing films such as &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991) and its sequel &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995), the &quot;Men in Black&quot; trilogy (1997–2012), and &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; (1999).

==Early life==
Sonnenfeld was born and raised in New York City, the son of Irene &quot;Kelly&quot; (Kellerman), an art teacher, and Sonny Sonnenfeld, a lighting salesman, educator, and architectural lighting designer. He was raised in a Jewish family. After he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Hampshire College, he graduated from New York University Film School in 1978.

==Career==
He began working on pornographic films before starting work as director of photography on the Oscar-nominated &quot;In Our Water&quot; (1982). When he met Joel Coen at a Christmas party, Coen told Sonnenfeld about &quot;Blood Simple&quot;, a script that he had written with brother Ethan Coen, and hired him to be their cinematographer, with the resulting movie coming out in 1984. This film began his collaboration with the Coen brothers, who used him for their next two pictures, &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; (1987) and &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990). He also worked with Danny DeVito on &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot; (1987) and Rob Reiner on &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; (1989) and &quot;Misery&quot; (1990).

Sonnenfeld gained his first work as a director from Paramount Pictures on &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, a box-office success released in November 1991. Its sequel, &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), was not as successful at the box office, but he received critical acclaim for his fourth directorial outing, &quot;Get Shorty&quot; (1995). Produced by Jersey Films and based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, the film won a Golden Globe for John Travolta (Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical). The film was also entered into the 46th Berlin International Film Festival. Following Tim Burton and the Coen brothers, Sonnenfeld&#x27;s films would tell stories about unusual and unorthodox people who are into the unexpected and the strange. His films would often use his trademark filmmaking techniques such as his unusual camera angles, offbeat dialogue and, in certain films, strange behavior and weird creatures.

In 1996, Steven Spielberg asked him to direct &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997). Starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, the film was a critical and financial success. In 1998, Jon Peters asked him to direct &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; (1999). Starring Smith and Kevin Kline, the film was a critical and financial flop. He also directed the comedy &quot;Big Trouble&quot; (2002), after which he made his most successful film sequel to that point, &quot;Men in Black II&quot; (2002). He is also a contributing editor for &quot;Esquire&quot;. He also co-produced (alongside his partner Barry Josephson) the 2007 film &quot;Enchanted&quot; for Walt Disney Pictures that starred Amy Adams. In 2008, Sonnenfeld earned an Emmy for directing &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;. Sonnenfeld returned for &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;; released in 2012, the third installment received positive reviews and became the highest-grossing film in the series worldwide. In 2007, his Right Coast production company has been signed with Sony.

His memoir, &quot;Barry Sonnenfeld, Call Your Mother: Memoirs of a Neurotic Filmmaker&quot;, was published by Hachette Books in 2020. In 2024, his second book, &quot;Best Possible Place, Worst Possible Time: True Stories from a Career in Hollywood&quot;, was published by Hachette.

==Personal life==
As of 2022, Sonnenfeld lives in Pemberton, British Columbia with his wife Susan.

In 1999, Sonnenfeld was the sole passenger on a plane that crashed upon landing at Van Nuys Airport. He was unhurt.

==Future projects==
He is working on new projects, among them include &quot;Things a Man Should Never Do Past 30&quot;: a single-camera comedy from executive producer/director Sonnenfeld, the Tannenbaum Company and Sony Pictures Television. The project mostly is based on the personal experiences of &quot;Esquire&quot; writer David Katz and &quot;Esquire&quot; editor at large A. J. Jacobs. The show is about a man working at a men&#x27;s magazine who is reluctant to embrace adulthood and his friend who is an immersion journalist. Al Higgins (&quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;) is set to serve as showrunner/head writer if the project is picked up.

He has become attached to a movie adaptation of &quot;The Spellman Files&quot; by Lisa Lutz, about a family of private investigators. Sonnenfeld will direct the movie adaptation of the fantasy novel &quot;Gil&#x27;s All Fright Diner&quot; in partnership with DreamWorks Animation. He is also developing a sitcom for ABC, &quot;Funny in Farsi&quot;, based on the book of the same name.

In 2012, it was stated that he was appointed to direct &quot;Lore&quot;, an adaptation based on the comic by T.P. Louise and Ashley Wood of the same name. But, in 2013, Indie director Dave Green has signed on to replace Barry Sonnenfeld as director, Sonnenfeld will take part as executive producer on the project.

Barry is also in talks with Warner Bros. to make a live action film adaptation of the DC Comics characters, The Metal Men. Sonnenfeld also agreed to direct the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; pilot for CBS and serve as an executive producer as well. However, Paramount Pictures dropped the idea in favor of a fourth film directed by Mark Molloy.

<text>Tomb KV5 is a subterranean, rock-cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings. 
It belonged to the sons of Ramesses II. Though KV5 was partially excavated as early as 1825, its true extent was discovered in 1995 by Kent R. Weeks and his exploration team. The tomb is now known to be the largest in the Valley of the Kings. Weeks&#x27; discovery is widely considered the most dramatic in the valley since the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922.

==History==
Standing near the entrance to the Valley, KV5 was robbed in antiquity. In addition, over the centuries, it suffered the fate of other low-lying tombs, which was to be filled with rubble washed down in the flash floods that accompany thunderstorms over the Valley.

The tomb was examined several times once exploration of the Valley in relatively modern times started, first in 1825 (by James Burton), and later in 1902 (by Howard Carter, discoverer of the tomb of Tutankhamun, who used KV5 only as a dumping ground). However, they were not able to penetrate past the first few rooms, and thus saw nothing unusual about the tomb.

It was not until the Theban Mapping Project, under Kent R. Weeks, began clearing the tomb (in part to see if it would be damaged by proposed building works nearby, and in part so that it could be mapped) that the stage was set for the discovery of its true extent and nature. Although the works had begun in 1987, the first substantial finding came in 1995, after extensive clearing in the outer chambers of the tomb: approximately 70 rooms, lined along long corridors, running back into the hillside. The number of rooms corresponds roughly to the number of sons the pharaoh sired. This discovery caused a worldwide sensation and reignited popular interest in Egyptology. Findings so far include thousands of potshards, &quot;ushabti&quot;, faience beads, hieratic ostraca, glass vials, inlays and a large statue of Osiris, the god of the afterlife.

Further excavations have revealed that the tomb is even larger than was first thought, as it contains more corridors, with more rooms, branching off from previously discovered parts of the tomb. At least 130 rooms or chambers have been discovered as of 2006 (only about 7% of which have been cleared), and work is still continuing on clearing the rest of the tomb.

Located near the tomb of Ramesses II (KV7), KV5 contained most of his children, both male and female, in particular those who died in his lifetime. The skull fragments of Amun-her-khepeshef, among others, were found inside and reconstructed.

<doc id="289986" wikidata="Q1189388" url="?curid=289986" title="The Magic School Bus (book series)">
<text>The Magic School Bus is a series of children&#x27;s books about science, written by Joanna Cole and illustrated by Bruce Degen. Designed for ages 6-9, they feature the antics of Ms. Valerie Felicity Frizzle and her class, who board a sentient anthropomorphic mini school bus which takes them on field trips to impossible locations, including the solar system, clouds, the past, and the human body. The books are written in the first person from the point of view of an unnamed student in &quot;the Friz&#x27;s&quot; class. The class has a pet lizard named Liz, who accompanies the class on their field trips. 

Since the &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; books present scientific facts in the form of stories in which fantastic things happen (for example, the bus turns into a spaceship, or children shrink to the size of blood cells), each book has a page at the end detailing in a humorous manner which parts of the book represented scientific fact and which were fanciful storytelling. Similarities to Maurice Dolbier&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Bus&quot; (1948) illustrated by Tibor Gergely are strictly coincidental.

== History ==
Craig Walker, vice-president and senior editorial director at Scholastic Co., stated that the concept began with the idea of combining science with fictional stories, and Joanna Cole (who had written both science and humor before) and Bruce Degen were then approached with creating such a series. Walker also states that his own memories of school field trips and of a teacher he had once, served as further inspiration.

The first book &quot;At the Waterworks&quot; was written in 1985 and published the following year.

Cole and Degen started a new series called &quot;Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s Adventures&quot; in 2001, which teaches social studies. In those books, Ms. Frizzle travels through time via a special watch. There are now three books in that series. Microsoft Home started publishing &quot;Magic School Bus&quot; software in 1994. TW Kids published four audio cassettes/activity book &quot;Fun-Kits&quot; in 1994 and 1995, these audio cassettes use audio from the TV Series. Scholastic has also published the original series books as read-along book-on-tapes and book-on-CDs.

Scholastic Entertainment, the American Meteorological Society and the Children&#x27;s Museum of Houston created a &quot;Scholastics the Magic School Bus Kicks Up a Storm&quot;, a traveling exhibit funded in part by the National Science Foundation, which premiered at the Children&#x27;s Museum of Houston in 2003 (a copy of it opened in New Jersey the month after that).

== Characters ==
In the original series books, Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s class had a larger number of multiethnic students and consisted of Alex, Amanda Jane, Arnold, Carlos, Carmen, Dorothy Ann, Florrie, Gregory, John, Keesha, Michael, Molly, Phil, Phoebe, Rachel, Ralph (changed to &quot;Ralphie&quot; on the show and later books in this series), Shirley, Tim and Wanda (19 students). Phoebe was first introduced in the 1987 book, &quot;The Magic School Bus Inside the Earth&quot;. Carlos and Keesha were added in the 1994 book, &quot;The Magic School Bus In the Time of Dinosaurs&quot;.

In the other books and merchandise --including the TV series and TV tie-in books-- Ms. Frizzle&#x27;s class was whittled down to eight kids (Arnold, Carlos, Dorothy Ann, Keesha, Phoebe, Ralphie, Tim and Wanda).

==Individual books==
The original Magic School Bus books are:
*&quot;The Magic School Bus at the Waterworks&quot; (, 1986)
**Theme: the water cycle and the waterworks
**Ms Frizzle&#x27;s class is going with her on the most boring field trip, to the waterworks. At least that is what they think until they discover how interesting things always happen on Ms Frizzle&#x27;s trips. After going through a tunnel, all the children find themselves in scuba diving outfits. On the top of a bridge the bus rises up in the air and into a cloud. Once in the cloud, the class finds that water droplets are growing, and they are shrinking. The class rains and lands in the water purification system. Eventually it takes them back to Walkerville Elementary, where they come out of the faucet in the girls&#x27; bathroom. Later, they see the bus outside and wonder how it returned from the cloud.
*&quot;The Magic School Bus Inside the Earth&quot; (, 1987)
**Theme: geology
**Ms Frizzle&#x27;s class is starting a unit on geology and for homework every student has to find a rock, and bring it to school. The next day every child except Phil has an excuse, so Ms Frizzle decides to take the class on a field trip to collect rocks. The class starts digging until they, with the help of the magic bus, dig all the way through the center of Earth. They collect many rocks and learn about the different types. Phoebe Terese first appears in this book as the &quot;new kid&quot;. Before the show was even in production, the Magic School Bus appeared on PBS, because this book was featured on &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot;.
*&quot;The Magic School Bus Inside the Human Body&quot; (, 1989)
**Theme: the human body
**Ms Frizzle&#x27;s class is going to the museum to see an exhibit on the human body. However they stop for lunch at a park and Arnold Perlstein takes too long to eat. When Ms Frizzle tries to hit the horn to tell him to hurry, she &quot;accidentally&quot; pushes a strange little button on the dashboard and the class finds itself inside a human body, but they are unaware that it is Arnold&#x27;s. They go through the digestive system and brain and out through the nose.
*&quot;The Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System&quot; (, 1990)
**Theme: the Solar System
**Arnold&#x27;s know-it-all cousin Janet, is coming on the field trip this time. They are going to the planetarium to see a show about the Solar System, but it is closed for repairs. On the way back to school, they blast off and fly into outer space. They visit all the planets and learn about them, but in the asteroid belt, they lose Ms Frizzle and find themselves lost in space. The rocket bus featured in this book has become a symbol of the Magic School Bus series.
*&quot;The Magic School Bus On the Ocean Floor&quot; (, 1992)
**Theme: the ocean
**Ms Frizzle&#x27;s class is learning about the ocean. It is really hot and the children just want a break. They are thrilled when she says they will take a trip to the ocean. When she gets to the beach she starts to drive into the water and they realise that when Ms Frizzle says &quot;ocean&quot; she means &quot;ocean&quot;. Believing the bus is in trouble, Lenny the Lifeguard decides to try to save the children and instead finds himself accompanying them on the field trip.
*&quot;The Magic School Bus In the Time of the Dinosaurs&quot; (, 1994)
**Theme: dinosaurs
**The children are turning their classroom into Dinosaur Land for Parents&#x27; Night, as they are studying dinosaurs. Ms. Frizzle receives a letter from an old high school friend who is now a paleontologist and she decides to take the class on a trip to the dig. When she discovers that they are missing the bones of some Maiasaurs, she turns the bus into a time machine to travel back to the age of dinosaurs to find the bones. The class sees dinosaurs and learns the name of the different periods of the era and other information. This is the first time Ms Frizzle&#x27;s first name is mentioned, and it is the first appearance of Carlos Ramon and Keesha Franklin, although Keesha was first seen in &quot;The Magic School Bus: On the Ocean Floor&quot;.
*&quot;The Magic School Bus Inside a Hurricane&quot; (, 1995)
**Theme: weather
**The class is going to the weather station to learn about weather. However, on the way there the bus turns into a hot air balloon. Eventually they find themselves inside a hurricane. Ms Frizzle&#x27;s radio proves an annoyance to Arnold in this book, as it seems to know his name.
*&quot;The Magic School Bus Inside a Beehive&quot; (1996)
**Theme: bees
**The class is now learning about insects and Ms Frizzle is taking her class on a trip to meet a beekeeper, but they beat the beekeeper there. While they are waiting, Ms Frizzle accidentally pushes a small lever which turns the bus into a tiny beehive and the class (including Ms Frizzle) into bees. They explore the hive and learn about bees, but can they save the hive from a bear?
*&quot;The Magic School Bus and the Electric Field Trip&quot; (1998)
**Theme: electricity
** The children in Ms Frizzle&#x27;s class were sure that there was nobody like her, but that was before they met her niece, Dottie Frizzle. Dottie accompanies the class on their field trip to the town power plant. There the bus turns into a dump truck, and pours the children into the plant. They shrink and travel through the Walkerville electric system.
*&quot;The Magic School Bus Explores the Senses&quot; (1999)
**Theme: the five senses
**The class is learning about the senses and they are going to sing a song for an important teacher meeting. However, Ms Frizzle&#x27;s personality and clothes make the class forget. Ms Frizzle thinks the meeting is tomorrow, but it is really today. So Mr. Wilde, the assistant principal, decides to catch her so he can tell her about the meeting. He decides to get in a bus that just happens to be the magic school bus. The class decides to accompany him. They cannot let him drive that bus, not all by himself. Mr. Wilde accidentally shrinks the bus and soon he and the class find themselves on a trip exploring the senses. Mr. Wilde soon becomes obsessed with driving the bus and forgets all about finding Ms Frizzle, but the class does not. Ms Frizzle&#x27;s mother appears in this book.
*&quot;The Magic School Bus and the Science Fair Expedition&quot; (; 2006)
**Theme: famous scientists in history

They decide to consult with famous scientists in history like Louis Pasteur, George Washington Carver, Charles Darwin, Marie Curie, Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei, even Albert Einstein. All the original characters are in this book.
*&quot;The Magic School Bus and the Climate Challenge&quot; (; 2010)

<doc id="289996" wikidata="Q1587050" url="?curid=289996" title="Hart District">
<text>Hart is a local government district in Hampshire, England, named after the River Hart. Its council is based in Fleet. The district also contains the towns of Blackwater and Yateley, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

In the English indices of deprivation for 2019, Hart was ranked as the least deprived district in England; a position it had also held in the 2015 index.

For five years running (2011–2015), an annual study conducted by the Halifax bank named Hart as the UK&#x27;s most desirable place to live for quality of life. The study took into account jobs, housing, health, crime, weather, traffic and broadband access. It found that in 2014 97% of people in the local authority area were in good health, and in 2011 tended to have incomes 40% above the national average.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Hartley Wintney Rural District
*Fleet Urban District
The new district was initially going to be named Hartley Wintney, after the rural district which covered most of the area, which in turn was named after the village of the same name. The shadow authority elected to oversee the transition to the new system requested a change of name to Hart, after the River Hart which runs through the area. The change of name was approved by the government on 17 January 1974, before the new district formally came into being.

The River Hart is said to derive its name from the number of deer in the area, with a hart being an old term for an adult male deer, synonymous with &quot;stag&quot;. The area historically had several deer parks. Hart District Council uses a profile of a stag as its logo.

==Governance==
Hart District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Hampshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2012. Since 2017 the council has been run by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats and local party Community Campaign (Hart), led by Liberal Democrat councillor David Neighbour.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially acting as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2008 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council is:

No party has majority control of the council; currently the Liberal Democrats and Community Campaign (Hart), a local residents&#x27; association, run the council as a joint administration. The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2014 the council has comprised 33 councillors representing 11 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected at a time for a four year term of office. Hampshire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no district council elections.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Offices on Harlington Way in Fleet. The building was purpose-built for the council in 1986.

==Demography==
In mid-2003 Hart had an estimated 85,700 residents. This compares with the 2001 Census figure of 83,505 residents. The 2001 Census also reported that there were 32,470 households, with 77% of residents describing their health as &#x27;good&#x27;. In the twenty years between 1982 and 2002 the population of Hart grew by 19 per cent, compared with an increase of 11 per cent for the South East region as a whole.

==Parishes and town councils==
The whole district is divided into civil parishes, listed below. The parish councils for Blackwater and Hawley, Fleet, and Yateley have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Whilst Hook is a post town it retains a parish council rather than a town council.

*Blackwater and Hawley
*Bramshill
*Church Crookham
*Crondall
*Crookham Village
*Dogmersfield
*Elvetham Heath

<text>Patrick Bruce Metheny ( ; born August 12, 1954) is an American jazz guitarist and composer.

He was the leader of the Pat Metheny Group (1977–2010) and continues to work in various small-combo, duet, and solo settings, as well as other side projects. His style incorporates elements of progressive and contemporary jazz, latin jazz, and jazz fusion. He has three gold albums and 20 Grammy Awards, and is the only person to have won Grammys in 10 categories.

==Biography==
===Early years and education===
Metheny was born in Lee&#x27;s Summit, Missouri. His father Dave played trumpet, his mother Lois sang, and his maternal grandfather Delmar was a professional trumpeter. Metheny&#x27;s first instrument was the trumpet, on which he was taught by his brother, Mike. Pat&#x27;s brother, father, and grandfather played trios together at home. His parents were fans of Glenn Miller and swing music. They took Pat to concerts to hear Clark Terry and Doc Severinsen, but they had little respect for guitar. Pat&#x27;s interest in guitar increased around 1964 when he saw the Beatles perform on TV. For his 12th birthday, his parents allowed him to buy a guitar, which was a Gibson ES-140 3/4.

Pat Metheny&#x27;s life changed after hearing the album &quot;Four &amp; More&quot; by Miles Davis. Soon after, he was captivated by Wes Montgomery&#x27;s album &quot;Smokin&#x27; at the Half Note&quot; which was released in 1965. He cites the Beatles, Miles Davis, and Montgomery as having the biggest impact on his music.

When he was 15, Metheny won a scholarship from &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine to a one-week jazz camp where he was mentored by guitarist Attila Zoller, who then invited him to New York City to meet guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Ron Carter.

While playing at a club in Kansas City, Metheny was approached by Bill Lee, a dean at the University of Miami, and offered a scholarship. After less than a week at college, Metheny realized that playing guitar all day during his teens had left him unprepared for classes. He admitted this to Lee, who offered him a job to teach as a professor, as the school had recently introduced electric guitar as a course of study.

He moved to Boston in the early 1970s to teach at the Berklee College of Music under the supervision of jazz vibraphonist Gary Burton and established a reputation as a prodigy. He appeared on Burton&#x27;s studio recordings, from &quot;Ring&quot; in 1974 to &quot;Passengers&quot; in 1977.

===Early albums===

In 1974, he appeared on an album unofficially titled &quot;Jaco&quot; with pianist Paul Bley, bassist Jaco Pastorius, and drummer Bruce Ditmas on Carol Goss&#x27;s Improvising Artists label—but he was unaware that he was being recorded. The next year he joined Gary Burton&#x27;s band with guitarist Mick Goodrick.

Metheny released his debut album, &quot;Bright Size Life&quot; (ECM, 1976), with Jaco Pastorius on bass guitar and Bob Moses on drums. His next album, &quot;Watercolors&quot; (ECM, 1977), was recorded with Eberhard Weber on bass and Danny Gottlieb on drums, and significantly marked Metheny&#x27;s first outing with pianist Lyle Mays, who would become his key collaborator in forming the Pat Metheny Group later that year. With Mark Egan on bass, the lineup was set for the group&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Pat Metheny Group&quot; (ECM, 1978).

==Pat Metheny Group==
When &quot;Pat Metheny Group&quot; (ECM, 1978) was released, the group was a quartet comprising Metheny, Danny Gottlieb on drums, Mark Egan on bass, and Lyle Mays on piano, autoharp, and synthesizer. All but Egan had played on Metheny&#x27;s album &quot;Watercolors&quot; (ECM, 1977), recorded the year before.

The second group album, &quot;American Garage&quot; (ECM, 1979), reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz chart and crossed over onto the pop charts. From 1982 to 1985, the Pat Metheny Group released &quot;Offramp&quot; (ECM, 1982), a live album, &quot;Travels&quot; (ECM, 1983), &quot;First Circle&quot; (ECM, 1984), and &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot; (EMI, 1985), a soundtrack album for the movie of the same name for which they collaborated on the single &quot;This Is Not America&quot; with David Bowie. The song reached number 14 in the British Top 40 in 1985 and number 32 in the U.S.

&quot;Offramp&quot; marked the first appearance of bassist Steve Rodby (replacing Egan) and a Brazilian guest artist, Nana Vasconcelos, on percussion and wordless vocals. On &quot;First Circle&quot;, Argentinian singer and multi-instrumentalist Pedro Aznar joined the group; as drummer, Paul Wertico replaced Gottlieb. Both Rodby and Wertico were members of the Simon and Bard Group at the time and had played in Simon-Bard in Chicago before joining Metheny.

&quot;First Circle&quot; was Metheny&#x27;s last album with ECM; he had been a key artist for the European record label but left following disagreements with the label&#x27;s founder, Manfred Eicher.

&quot;Still Life (Talking)&quot; (Geffen, 1987) featured new group members trumpeter Mark Ledford, vocalist David Blamires, and percussionist Armando Marçal. Aznar returned for vocals and guitar on &quot;Letter from Home&quot; (Geffen, 1989).

With Metheny working on multiple projects, it was four years before the release of the next group record, a live album titled &quot;The Road to You&quot; (Geffen, 1993). This release featured live versions of tracks from the two Geffen studio albums as well as previously unreleased tunes.

Metheny and Mays have referred to the next three Pat Metheny Group releases as a triptych: &quot;We Live Here&quot; (Geffen, 1995), &quot;Quartet&quot; (Geffen, 1996), and &quot;Imaginary Day&quot; (Warner Bros., 1997). Moving away from the Brazilian-inspired styles which had dominated the releases of the previous ten years, these albums included experiments with hip-hop rhythms, sequenced synthetic drums, free-form improvisation on acoustic instruments, and symphonic signatures, blues, and sonata schemes.

With &quot;Speaking of Now&quot; (Warner Bros., 2002), new group members were added: drummer Antonio Sánchez from Mexico City, Vietnamese-American trumpeter Cuong Vu, and bassist, vocalist, guitarist, and percussionist Richard Bona from Cameroon.

On &quot;The Way Up&quot; (Nonesuch, 2005), harmonica player Grégoire Maret from Switzerland was introduced as a new group member, while Bona contributed as a guest musician. The album consists of a single 68-minute-long piece—split into four sections—based on a three-note motif: the opening B, A, F, and its later variation F, A, B.

==Solo releases==
Metheny has recorded albums under his solo artist billing regularly throughout his career. His solo acoustic guitar albums include &quot;New Chautauqua&quot; (ECM, 1979), &quot;One Quiet Night&quot; (Warner Bros., 2003), and &quot;What&#x27;s It All About&quot; (Nonesuch, 2011).

Building on the work of his experimental quartets , Metheny further explored fringes of the avant-garde on &quot;Zero Tolerance for Silence&quot; (Geffen, 1994), a solo electric guitar outing.

For the album &quot;Orchestrion&quot; (Nonesuch, 2010) Metheny hand-crafted an array of elaborate, custom mechanical instruments which allowed him to compose and perform as a one-person orchestra. By contrast, his album &quot;Secret Story&quot; (Geffen, 1992) uses lush orchestral arrangements usually found in movie soundtracks, such as &quot;The Falcon and the Snowman&quot; and his own &quot;A Map of the World&quot; (Warner Bros., 1999) film soundtrack.

Recent solo-billed recordings include &quot;From This Place&quot; (Nonesuch, 2020), recorded with a variety of guest artists, and the all-guitar collaboration &quot;Road to the Sun&quot; (Modern Recordings, 2021).

==Unity Band==
In 2012, Metheny formed the Unity Band with Antonio Sánchez on drums, Ben Williams on bass and Chris Potter on saxophone. This quartet released the album &quot;Unity Band&quot; (Nonesuch, 2012) and toured Europe and the U.S. during the latter half of the year. In 2013, as an extension of the Unity Band project, Metheny announced the formation of the Pat Metheny Unity Group, with the addition of the Italian multi-instrumentalist Giulio Carmassi.

==Side projects==

Outside the Group, Metheny has shown different sides of his musical personality. An early duo billing with Lyle Mays, &quot;As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls&quot; (ECM, 1981), includes Brazilian percussionist and vocalist Naná Vasconcelos for an elegant set noted for its atmospheric, long-form title track. In 1983, Metheny and Mays wrote music for the Steppenwolf Theater Company&#x27;s production of Lyle Kessler&#x27;s play &quot;Orphans&quot;. It has remained special optional music for productions of the play around the world since.

Metheny ventured into experimental jazz with the quartet releases &quot;80/81&quot; (ECM, 1980), &quot;Song X&quot; (Geffen, 1986) with Ornette Coleman, and &quot;The Sign of Four&quot; with Derek Bailey (Knitting Factory Works, 1997).

In 1997, Metheny recorded with bassist Marc Johnson on Johnson&#x27;s release &quot;The Sound of Summer Running&quot; (Verve, 1998). The next year, he recorded a guitar duet with Jim Hall (Telarc, 1999), whose work has strongly influenced Metheny&#x27;s. He collaborated with Polish jazz and folk singer Anna Maria Jopek on &quot;Upojenie&quot; (Warner Poland, 2002) and Bruce Hornsby on &quot;Hot House&quot; (RCA, 2005). He has also played on albums by his older brother, Mike Metheny, a jazz trumpeter, among them &quot;Day In – Night Out&quot; (1986) and &quot;Close Enough for Love&quot; (2001).

==Influences==
As a young guitarist, Metheny tried to sound like Wes Montgomery, but when he was 14 or 15, he decided it was disrespectful to imitate him. In the liner notes on the 2-disc Montgomery compilation &quot;Impressions: The Verve Jazz Sides&quot;, Metheny is quoted as saying, &quot;&quot;Smokin&#x27; at the Half Note&quot; is the absolute greatest jazz-guitar album ever made. It is also the record that taught me how to play.&quot;

Ornette Coleman&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;New York Is Now!&quot; inspired Metheny to find his own direction. He has recorded Coleman&#x27;s compositions on a number of albums, starting with a medley of &quot;Round Trip&quot; and &quot;Broadway Blues&quot; on his debut album, &quot;Bright Size Life&quot; (1976). He worked extensively with Coleman&#x27;s collaborators, such as Charlie Haden, Dewey Redman, and Billy Higgins, and he recorded the album &quot;Song X&quot; (1986) with Coleman and toured with him.

Metheny made three albums on ECM with Brazilian vocalist and percussionist Naná Vasconcelos. He lived in Brazil from the late 1980s to the early 1990s and performed with several local musicians, such as Milton Nascimento and Toninho Horta. He played with Antônio Carlos Jobim as a tribute, in a live performance in &quot;Carnegie Hall Salutes The Jazz Masters: Verve 50th Anniversary&quot;.

He is also a fan of several pop music artists, especially singer/songwriters including James Taylor (after whom he named the song &quot;James&quot; on &quot;Offramp&quot;); Bruce Hornsby, Cheap Trick, and Joni Mitchell, with whom he performed on her &quot;Shadows and Light&quot; (Asylum/Elektra, 1980) live tour. Metheny is also fond of Buckethead&#x27;s music. He also worked with, sponsored or helped to make recordings of singer/songwriters from all over the world, such as Pedro Aznar (Argentina), Akiko Yano (Japan), David Bowie (UK), Silje Nergaard (Norway), Noa (Israel), and Anna Maria Jopek (Poland).

Two of Metheny&#x27;s albums, &quot;The Way Up&quot; (2005) and &quot;Orchestrion&quot; (2010), show the influence of American minimalist composer Steve Reich, with rhythmic figures structured around a recurring pulse. Decades earlier, Metheny had appeared on Reich&#x27;s album &quot;Different Trains&quot; (Nonesuch, 1987) performing Reich&#x27;s composition, &quot;Electric Counterpoint&quot;.

==Guitars==
===Pikasso===

Metheny plays a custom-made 42-string Pikasso I created by Canadian luthier Linda Manzer. He plays it on &quot;Into the Dream&quot; and on the albums &quot;Quartet&quot; (1996), &quot;Imaginary Day&quot; (1997), &quot;Jim Hall &amp; Pat Metheny&quot; (1999), &quot;Trio → Live&quot; (Warner Bros., 2000), and the &quot;Speaking of Now Live&quot; and &quot;Imaginary Day Live&quot; DVDs. Metheny has used the guitar in his guest appearances on other artists&#x27; albums. He used the Pikasso on &quot;Metheny/Mehldau Quartet&quot; (Nonesuch, 2007), his second collaboration with pianist Brad Mehldau and his trio sidemen Larry Grenadier and Jeff Ballard; the Pikasso is featured on Metheny&#x27;s composition &quot;The Sound of Water&quot;. Manzer has made many acoustic guitars for Metheny, including a mini guitar, an acoustic sitar guitar, and the baritone guitar, which Metheny used for the recording of &quot;One Quiet Night&quot; (2003).

===Guitar synthesizer===
Metheny was one of the first jazz guitarists to use the Roland GR-300 guitar synthesizer. He commented, &quot;you have to stop thinking about it as a guitar, because it no longer is a guitar.&quot; He approaches it as if he were a horn player, and he prefers the &quot;high trumpet&quot; sound of the instrument. One of the patches that he has often used is on Roland&#x27;s JV-80 &quot;Vintage Synth&quot; expansion card, titled &quot;Pat&#x27;s GR-300&quot;. In addition to the Roland, he uses a Synclavier controller.

===Six-string and twelve-string electric===
Metheny was an early proponent of the twelve-string guitar in jazz. During his 1975 tour with the Gary Burton &quot;Quartet&quot; (five people, including Metheny), he primarily played electric twelve-string guitar against the six-string work of resident guitarist Mick Goodrick.

Prior to Metheny, Pat Martino had used the electric twelve-string guitar on a studio album, &quot;Desperado&quot;, and John McLaughlin had used a double-neck electric guitar with the Mahavishnu Orchestra. Ralph Towner was perhaps the first to use acoustic twelve-string guitar extensively in jazz (&quot;The Moors&quot;, from Weather Report&#x27;s &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;, Columbia, 1972), and Larry Coryell and Philip Catherine made extensive use of acoustic twelve string in alternate tunings at the 1975 Montreux Jazz Festival, later releasing some of the material on their 1976 &quot;Twin House&quot; album.

Metheny used a twelve-string guitar on his debut album, &quot;Bright Size Life&quot; (1976), including alternate tuning on &quot;Sirabhorn&quot;, and on later albums (&quot;San Lorenzo&quot;, from &quot;Pat Metheny Group&quot; and &quot;Travels&quot;).

===Use of hollow-body electric guitars===
At the age of 12, Metheny bought a natural finish Gibson ES-175 that he played throughout his early career, until it was retired in 1995. After his first tour of Japan in 1978, he began an association with Ibanez guitars, who have since produced a range of PM signature models.

==Personal life==
Metheny is the younger brother of jazz flugelhornist Mike Metheny. He lives in New York City with his wife, Latifa (née Azhar), and three children. Latifa has been credited for album photography. Metheny was once in a relationship with Sônia Braga.

<text>Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland (c. 136421 October 1425), was an English nobleman of the House of Neville.

==Origins==
Ralph Neville was born about 1364, the son of John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville by his wife Maud Percy (d. 1379), a daughter of Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy of Alnwick, Northumberland, by his wife Idoine de Clifford, a daughter of Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. Neville had a younger brother, and five sisters:

*Thomas Neville, 5th Baron Furnivall, who married Joan Furnival. Father of Maud Neville, 6th Baroness Furnivall, wife of John Talbot, 7th Baron Talbot.
*Lady Alice Neville, who married William Deincourt, 3rd Lord Deincourt
*Lady Maud Neville, who married Sir William le Scrope
*Lady Idoine Neville
*Lady Eleanor Neville, who married Ralph Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley.
*Lady Elizabeth Neville, who became a nun.

Neville&#x27;s father married secondly, before 9 October 1381, Elizabeth Latimer (died 5 November 1395), daughter of William Latimer, 4th Baron Latimer. By his father&#x27;s second marriage Neville had a brother and sister of the half blood:

*John Neville, 6th Baron Latimer (c. 138210 December 1430), who married firstly Maud Clifford (died c. 26 August 1446), daughter of Thomas Clifford, 6th Baron Clifford, whom he divorced before 1413–17, and by whom he had no issue. She married secondly Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, beheaded on 5 August 1415 for his part in the Southampton Plot.
*Lady Elizabeth Neville, who married Sir Thomas Willoughby.

==Career==
Neville&#x27;s first military service was in Brittany under King Richard II&#x27;s uncle, Thomas of Woodstock, who knighted him at Saint-Omer in July 1380. On 14 November 1381 he and his cousin, Henry &quot;Hotspur&quot; Percy, were commissioned to preside over a duel between an Englishman and a Scot, and on 1 December 1383 he and his father were commissioned to receive from the Scots 24,000 marks for the ransom of King David. On 26 October 1385 he was appointed joint Governor of Carlisle with Sir Thomas Clifford, and on 27 March 1386 was appointed, together with Clifford, joint Warden of the West March.

Neville inherited the title at the age of 24 after his father&#x27;s death on 17 October 1388, and was summoned to Parliament from 6 December 1389 to 30 November 1396 by writs directed to &quot;Radulpho de Nevyll de Raby&quot;. On 25 October 1388, he was appointed, with others, to survey the fortifications on the Scottish border, and on 24 May 1389 was made keeper for life of the royal forests north of the Trent. In 1393 and 1394 he was employed in peace negotiations with Scotland.

In 1397 Neville supported King Richard&#x27;s proceedings against Thomas of Woodstock and the Lords Appellant, and by way of reward was created Earl of Westmorland on 29 September of that year. However his loyalty to the King was tested shortly thereafter. His first wife, Margaret Stafford, had died on 9 June 1396, and Neville&#x27;s second marriage to Joan Beaufort before 29 November 1396 made him the son-in-law of King Richard&#x27;s uncle, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Thus, when King Richard banished John of Gaunt&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Henry Bolingbroke, on 16 September 1398, and confiscated Bolingbroke&#x27;s estates after John of Gaunt&#x27;s death on 3 February 1399, Westmorland was moved to support his brother-in-law. Bolingbroke landed with a small force at Ravenspur in July 1399. Westmorland and the Earl of Northumberland were in the deputation at the Tower which received King Richard&#x27;s abdication, and Westmorland bore the small sceptre called the &quot;virge&quot; at Bolingbroke&#x27;s coronation as King Henry IV on 13 October 1399.

For his support of the new King, Westmorland was rewarded with a lifetime appointment as Earl Marshal on 30 September 1399 (although he resigned the office in 1412), a lifetime grant of the honour of Richmond on 20 October (although the grant was not accompanied by a grant of the title Earl of Richmond), and several wardships. Before 4 December he was appointed to the King&#x27;s council. In March 1401, Westmorland was one of the commissioners who conducted negotiations for a marriage between the King&#x27;s eldest daughter, Blanche of England, and Louis, son of Rupert, King of the Romans, and in 1403 was made a Knight of the Garter, taking the place left vacant by the death of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York.

According to Tuck, Westmorland had little influence on the Scottish borders in the first years of Henry IV&#x27;s reign, where the wardenships of the marches were monopolised by the Percys, leading to a growing rivalry between the two families. However, in 1403 the Percys, spurred on by various grievances, took up arms against the King, and suffered defeat at the Battle of Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403. Northumberland&#x27;s son, Henry Percy (&quot;Hotspur&quot;), was slain at Shrewsbury, and Northumberland&#x27;s brother, the Earl of Worcester, was beheaded two days later. After Shrewsbury, King Henry ordered Westmorland to raise troops and prevent Northumberland&#x27;s army, which was still in the north, from advancing south. On 6 August 1403,as a reward for his service in driving Northumberland back to Warkworth Castle, Westmorland was granted the wardenship of the West March which Northumberland had held since 1399, the wardenship of the East March, formerly held by Hotspur, being granted to the King&#x27;s 14-year-old son, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford.

Two years later Northumberland, joined by Lord Bardolf, again took up arms against the King. It had been Northumberland&#x27;s plan to capture the earl by surprise at the outset, and in early May 1405, with 400 men, Northumberland made a surprise attack at the castle of Witton-le-Wear, where he had been staying. The attempt failed, as Westmorland had already fled. The earl speedily gathered an army, defeated a force of Percy allies at Topcliffe, and then marched towards York with Henry IV&#x27;s son, John of Lancaster, to confront a force of some 8000 men gathered on Shipton Moor under the leadership of Archbishop Richard Scrope, Thomas de Mowbray, 4th Earl of Norfolk, and Scrope&#x27;s nephew, Sir William Plumpton. Outnumbered by Scrope&#x27;s forces, Westmorland resorted to trickery, and led Scrope and his allies to believe that their demands would be accepted and their personal safety guaranteed. Once Scrope&#x27;s army had been disbanded on 29 May, Scrope, Mowbray and Plumpton were arrested, summarily condemned to death for treason, and beheaded outside the walls of York on 8 June 1405. Although Westmorland handed Scrope and his allies over to the King at Pontefract, he played no role in their hasty and irregular trial and execution, having been sent north by the King on 4 June to seize Northumberland&#x27;s castles. It is unclear whether Northumberland had initially planned to rebel openly in concert with Scrope, but in the event, he gave Scrope no support and fled to Scotland after his failed attempt to capture Westmorland. His estates were subsequently forfeited to the crown, and Ralph, earl of Westmorland, as a reward for his quelling of the 1405 rebellion without significant bloodshed, received a large grant of former Percy lands in Cumberland and Northumberland in June 1405.

After the death of Henry IV Westmorland was mainly engaged in the defence of the northern border in his capacity as Warden of the West March (1403–1414). In 1415 he decisively defeated an invading Scottish army at the Battle of Yeavering. Westmorland played no part in King Henry V&#x27;s French campaigns, and Tuck notes that his relationship with Henry V was not close, perhaps partly because of the involvement of Westmorland&#x27;s son-in-law, Sir Thomas Grey of Heaton, in the Southampton Plot. After Henry V&#x27;s death, Westmorland was a member of the Council of Regency during the minority of King Henry VI.

According to Tait, Westmorland was &quot;no inconsiderable builder&quot;, citing his rebuilding of Sheriff Hutton Castle on a scale so magnificent that Leland saw &quot;no house in the north so like a princely lodging&quot;, his doubling of the entrance gateway of Raby Castle and the corresponding tower, and possibly his responsibility for the &quot;tall and striking tower&quot; of Richmond parish church. On 1 November 1410 Westmorland was granted licence to found a college for a master, six clerks, six &quot;decayed gentlemen&quot; and others at Staindrop, towards the completion of which he left a bequest in his will. He was probably responsible for the building of Penrith castle in Cumberland c. 1412–13.

==Marriages and issue==

Ralph Neville married twice and had 22 children:

===First marriage===
He married firstly Margaret Stafford (died 9 June 1396), the eldest daughter of Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford, by his wife Philippa Beauchamp, a daughter of Thomas Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick (by his wife Katherine Mortimer, the daughter of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March).

==Death, burial, and succession==
Westmorland died on 21 October 1425 and was buried in the choir of his Collegiate Church of St. Mary at Staindrop. The magnificent alabaster tomb with effigies of himself and his two wives there has been termed the finest sepulchral monument in the north of England. Neither of his wives is buried with him. His first wife, Margaret Stafford, was buried at Brancepeth, County Durham, while his second wife, Joan Beaufort, was buried with her mother under a stone canopy in the sanctuary of Lincoln Cathedral.

Westmorland was predeceased by his eldest son Sir John Neville (c.1387–1420), and was succeeded in the title by his grandson (the latter&#x27;s son) Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland (1406–1484).

==Shakespeare and Westmorland==
Westmorland is portrayed in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, and &quot;Henry V&quot;.

In the opening scene of &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot;, Westmorland is presented historically as an ally of King Henry IV against the Percys, and in the final scenes of the play as being dispatched to the north of England by the King after the Battle of Shrewsbury to intercept the Earl of Northumberland.

In Act IV of &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, Westmorland is portrayed historically as having been principally responsible for quelling the Percy rebellion in 1405 by Archbishop Scrope almost without bloodshed by successfully parleying with the rebels on 29 May 1405 at Shipton Moor.

However, in &quot;Henry V&quot; Westmorland is unhistorically alleged to have resisted the arguments made in favour of war with France by Archbishop Chichele in the Parliament which began at Leicester on 30 April 1414. Following Hall and Holinshed, Shakespeare attributes these arguments to Chichele at a time when Chichele was not yet formally Archbishop, although he had been appointed by the King immediately following the death of Archbishop Arundel on 14 February 1414. Moreover, it is said that the Parliamentary rolls do not record Chichele&#x27;s presence, and according to Tait the question of war with France was not discussed. In addition, Westmorland&#x27;s speech urging the advantages of war against Scotland rather than France is said to be adapted from a work by the Scottish historian, John Major, who was not born until half a century after the 1414 Parliament.

The First Folio text of &quot;Henry V&quot; also unhistorically gives these lines to Westmorland on the eve of Agincourt:

&quot;O that we now had here&quot;
&quot;But one ten thousand of those men in England&quot;
&quot;That do no work today.&quot; (Henry V, IV.iii)

Westmorland was not with King Henry V on the 1415 campaign in France. On 17 April 1415 he was appointed to the Council of Regency which was to govern England under the King&#x27;s brother, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, during the King&#x27;s absence in France, with special responsibility for the Scottish Marches. In the first quarto text of the play, the foregoing lines are assigned to the Earl of Warwick.

It has been claimed by Brenda James and Professor William Rubinstein that Neville&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson Sir Henry Neville wrote the works of William Shakespeare.

<text>Li Lu (Chinese: 李录; born April 6, 1966) 
is a Chinese-born American value investor, businessman and philanthropist. He is the founder and chairman of Himalaya Capital. Prior to immigrating to America, he was one of the student leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests. In 2021, he also co-founded The Asian American Foundation and serves as its chairman.

==Early life and education==
Li Lu was born in April 1966, in Tangshan, China. He was a survivor of 1976 Tangshan earthquake, one of the deadliest in recorded history. During Mao Zedong&#x27;s Cultural Revolution of the 1960&#x27;s, his parents were sent to labor camps by the government. As a consequence, he transitioned through multiple orphanages and caretakers as he grew up.

In 1985, he went to Nanjing University, where he majored in physics but later transferred to economics. In 1989, he participated in the Tiananmen Square student protests and became one of the student leaders. He helped organize the students and participated in a hunger strike. After the crackdown on the movement, he fled the PRC and went to New York City at the age of 23, where his grandfather had received his PhD at Columbia University.

In 1990, he published a book about his experience in China titled &quot;Moving the Mountain: My Life in China.&quot; The book was the basis of a 1994 feature-film documentary, &quot;Moving the Mountain&quot;, produced by Trudie Styler and directed by Michael Apted, which probed the origins of the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square and the consequences of the movement in the lives of several of the movement&#x27;s student leaders. The book recounts a symbolic marriage ceremony on May 22, 1989, between Li Lu and his then girlfriend, Zhao Ming, at the Heroes&#x27; Monument. Students gathered at the wedding to congratulate the married couple and sang the &quot;Wedding March,&quot; which gradually turned into &quot;The Internationale.&quot; Chai Ling quotes Li Lu in her book as saying the marriage was meaningless.

At Columbia, Li first enrolled in the American Language Program to learn English. He then studied in the School of General Studies and later transferred to Columbia College. He ended up joining the college, law school and business school over a six-year period. Li Lu was one of the first in Columbia&#x27;s history to receive three degrees simultaneously: a B.A. in economics, a M.B.A. and a J.D. in 1996.

==Investment career==

Li was inspired to get into investment after hearing Warren Buffett, a Columbia alumnus, give a lecture at Columbia in 1993. As detailed in the Foreword to the Chinese Edition of &quot;Poor Charlie&#x27;s Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger&quot;, Li Lu found Buffett&#x27;s lecture on the principles of investing in the stock market &quot;concise, logical and convincing.&quot; Shortly thereafter, Li Lu began investing in stocks while a student at Columbia University.

He began his career in investment banking as a corporate finance associate at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette in 1996. In 1997, he founded Himalaya Capital, known for its disciplined and value-oriented approach to investing.

Charlie Munger, vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and a long-time partner of the legendary investor Warren Buffett, was one of the investors of his fund, and a &quot;mentor and good friend&quot; (in Li Lu&#x27;s own words). Li Lu met Charlie Munger on Thanksgiving 2003 and they had been lifetime friends. Munger has stated that Li Lu is the only outside manager he has ever invested with and has described him as the &quot;Chinese Warren Buffett.&quot;

Li Lu&#x27;s investing mantra is &quot;accurate and complete information,&quot; including understanding the character of a CEO by visiting his local church and speaking to his neighbors. He believes the most important thing in investing is intellectual honesty, recognizing that there is always a possibility that &quot;you don&#x27;t know that you don&#x27;t know.&quot; According to a 2021 interview by Columbia Business School Professor Bruce Greenwald, Li Lu&#x27;s investment strategy attempts to identify and invest in long-term compounders, focusing on the nature of a business&#x27; competition &quot;such that one could predict the outcome in 10 years, even with all the up and downs in the macro environment&quot; which he says is the most important.

Li Lu has been known as the man who introduced the Chinese battery and electric car maker BYD Company to Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett. He is an informal advisor to BYD. His investment partnership owns about 2.5% of BYD.

Li was rumored to be the front runner to manage a large portion of Berkshire Hathaway&#x27;s investment portfolio once Warren Buffett steps down. A report in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; quoted Charlie Munger as saying he regards it as &quot;a foregone conclusion&quot; that Li Lu would be one of Berkshire&#x27;s top investment officials after Warren Buffett retires. This was also hinted several times in some conversations with Buffett. In 2010, it was revealed that Li Lu had withdrawn himself from consideration for the job.

==Philanthropy &amp; other activities==
In May 2021, Li Lu alongside several Asian-American business leaders, including Jerry Yang, co-founder of Yahoo, and Joseph Tsai, co-founder of Alibaba, launched The Asian American Foundation (TAAF) a nonprofit organization with $125 million in initial commitments from the board. TAAF&#x27;s mission statement is to serve the 23 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) in three key areas: anti-hate programs, education, and data and research. Li Lu serves as co-founder and chairman of the board of The Asian American Foundation (TAAF). Since launch, TAAF has raised over $1 billion to support AAPI communities.

In January 2020, Li Lu co-founded the Guardians of the Angeles Charitable Foundation to combat the global COVID-19 crisis and now serves as Chairman of the Board of the Foundation.

In May 2010, Li Lu helped to translate and publish the Chinese version of &quot;Poor Charlie&#x27;s Almanack, The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger&quot; () in China and wrote a foreword for the book. In 2020, Li Lu wrote and published a book in China titled &quot;Civilization, Modernization, Value Investment and China&quot;.

Li Lu currently serves as a trustee of Columbia University and California Institute of Technology (Caltech).

==Recognition==
Li Lu was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2020. He is a past recipient of the John Jay Award from Columbia College, the Raoul Wallenberg Human Rights Award from the Congressional Human Rights Foundation, and the Reebok Human Rights Award. He is featured in the Smithsonian Institute&#x27;s Family of Voices, a part of the ongoing twenty-year Exhibition, starting in 2017, &quot;Many Voices, One Nation&quot; at the National Museum of American History.

<text>The Noguchi Museum (chartered as The Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum) is a museum and sculpture garden at 3237 Vernon Boulevard in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens in New York City, designed and created by the Japanese American sculptor Isamu Noguchi (1904–1988). Opening on a limited basis to the public in 1985, the museum and foundation were intended to preserve and display Noguchi&#x27;s sculptures, architectural models, stage designs, drawings, and furniture designs. The two-story, museum and sculpture garden, one block from the Socrates Sculpture Park, underwent major renovations in 2004 allowing the museum to stay open year-round.

==History==

To house the museum, in 1974 Noguchi purchased a photogravure plant and gas station located across the street from his New York studio, where he had worked and lived since 1961. The Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum opened to the public in 1985 on a seasonal basis. At the time, it was the first such museum to be established by a living artist in America.

In 1999, the Foundation Board approved a $13.5 million capital master plan to address structural concerns, ADA and NYC Building Code compliance and create a new public education facility. During renovation, the museum relocated to a temporary space in Sunnyside, Queens, and held several thematic exhibitions of Noguchi&#x27;s work. In February 2004, the museum was formally chartered as a museum, and granted 501(c)(3) public charity status. The Noguchi Museum reopened to the public at its newly renovated space in June 2004. The museum building continued to suffer from structural issues into the early 2000s and a second $8 million stabilization project was begun in September 2008. As a result, there are now 12 galleries and a gift shop within the museum.

In 2022, the museum was awarded $4.5 million in capital funding, $1.5 million of which came from Mayor Eric Adams and the rest from Queens Borough president Donovan Richards. The funds will be used for a restoration of the artist&#x27;s original 1959 living and studio space situated opposite the museum as well as for a new two-story, 6,000-square-foot building adjacent to the studio to house the museum&#x27;s collection and archival material.

===Tree of Heaven===
Until March 26, 2008, a -tall 75-year-old Tree of Heaven (&quot;Ailanthus altissima&quot;) was a prominent centerpiece of the sculpture garden at the museum. The tree was spared by Noguchi when in 1975 he bought the building which would become the museum and cleaned up its back lot. &quot;[I]n a sense, the sculpture garden was designed around the tree&quot;, said a former aide to Noguchi, Bonnie Rychlak, who later became the museum curator. By early 2008, the tree was found to be dying and threatened to crash into the building, which was about to undergo an $8.2 million renovation. The museum hired the Detroit Tree of Heaven Woodshop, an artists&#x27; collective, to use the wood to make benches, sculptures and other amenities in and around the building.

==Programs==
=== Exhibition ===
The museum celebrated the 25th anniversary of its opening with the exhibition &quot;On Becoming an Artist. Isamu Noguchi and His Contemporaries, 1922 – 1960&quot;, which open from November 17, 2010, to April 24, 2011

Other artists whose work have been featured include Koho Yamamoto and Toshiko Takaezu.

===Education===
The museum&#x27;s educational program, &quot;Art for Families&quot;, is a community outreach program aimed at families. The museum also runs a program called &quot;Art for Tots&quot; for young children.

<text>Glenn Hammond Curtiss (May 21, 1878 – July 23, 1930) was an American aviation and motorcycling pioneer, and a founder of the U.S. aircraft industry. He began his career as a bicycle racer and builder before moving on to motorcycles. As early as 1904, he began to manufacture engines for airships. In 1908, Curtiss joined the Aerial Experiment Association, a pioneering research group, founded by Alexander Graham Bell at Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia, to build flying machines.

Curtiss won a race at the world&#x27;s first international air meet in France and made the first long-distance flight in the U.S. His contributions in designing and building aircraft led to the formation of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company, which later merged into the Curtiss-Wright Corporation. His company built aircraft for the U.S. Army and Navy, and, during the years leading up to World War I, his experiments with seaplanes led to advances in naval aviation. Curtiss civil and military aircraft were some of the most important types in the interwar and World War II eras.
==Birth and early career==
Glenn Curtiss was born in 1878 in Hammondsport, New York, situated on the southern tip of Keuka Lake, one of the Finger Lakes in New York. His mother was Lua Curtiss née Andrews and his father was Frank Richmond Curtiss a harness maker who had arrived in Hammondsport with Glenn&#x27;s grandparents in 1876. Glenn&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Claudius G. Curtiss, a Methodist Episcopal clergyman, and Ruth Bramble. Glenn Curtiss had a younger sister, Rutha Luella, also born in Hammondsport.

Although his formal education extended only to eighth grade, his early interest in mechanics and inventions was evident at his first job at the Eastman Dry Plate and Film Company (later Eastman Kodak Company) in Rochester, New York. His job at the factory was to stencil numbers on the paper backing of the film manufactured by the company. He figured out how to speed up the process of stenciling and built a &quot;stencil machine&quot;: a rack with a brush on a hinge which would stencil one hundred paper strips with a single stroke of the brush. This improved his throughput ten times, and eventually the company adopted his invention.

He also built a rudimentary camera to study photography.

==Marriage and family==
On March 7, 1898, Curtiss married Lena Pearl Neff (1879–1951), daughter of Guy L. Neff and Jenny M. Potter, in Hammondsport, New York. They had two children: 
Carlton N. Curtiss (1901–1902) and
Glenn Hammond Curtiss (1912–1969)

==Bicycles and motorcycles==

Curtiss began his career as a Western Union bicycle messenger, a bicycle racer, and bicycle-shop owner. In 1901, he developed an interest in motorcycles when internal-combustion engines became more available. In 1902, Curtiss began manufacturing motorcycles with his own single-cylinder engines. His first motorcycle&#x27;s carburetor was adapted from a tomato soup can containing a gauze screen to pull the gasoline up by capillary action. In 1903, he set a motorcycle land speed record at for one mile (1.6 km). When E.H. Corson of the Hendee Mfg Co (manufacturers of Indian motorcycles) visited Hammondsport in July 1904, he was amazed that the entire Curtiss motorcycle enterprise was located in the back room of the modest &quot;shop&quot;. Corson&#x27;s motorcycles had just been trounced the week before by &quot;Hell Rider&quot; Curtiss in an endurance race from New York to Cambridge, Maryland.

On January 24, 1907, Curtiss set an unofficial world record of , on a V-8-powered motorcycle of his own design and construction in Ormond Beach, Florida. The air-cooled F-head engine was intended for use in aircraft. He remained &quot;the fastest man in the world&quot;, the title the newspapers gave him, until 1911, and his motorcycle record was not broken until 1930. This motorcycle is now in the Smithsonian Institution. Curtiss&#x27;s success at racing strengthened his reputation as a leading maker of high-performance motorcycles and engines.

==Aviation pioneer==

=== Curtiss, motor expert ===
In 1904, Curtiss became a supplier of engines for the California &quot;aeronaut&quot; Tom Baldwin, who inspired Curtiss to pursue aviation. In that same year, Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;California Arrow&quot;, powered by a Curtiss 9 HP V-twin motorcycle engine, became the first successful dirigible in America.

In 1907, Alexander Graham Bell invited Curtiss to develop a suitable engine for heavier-than-air flight experimentation. Bell regarded Curtiss as &quot;the greatest motor expert in the country&quot; and invited Curtiss to join his Aerial Experiment Association (AEA).

=== AEA aircraft experiments ===
Between 1908 and 1910, the AEA produced four aircraft, each one an improvement over the last. Curtiss primarily designed the AEA&#x27;s third aircraft, Aerodrome #3, the famous &quot;June Bug&quot;, and became its test pilot, undertaking most of the proving flights. On July 4, 1908, he flew to win the Scientific American Trophy and its $2,500 prize. This is considered to be the first pre-announced public flight of a heavier-than-air flying machine in America. The flight of the &quot;June Bug&quot; propelled Curtiss and aviation firmly into public awareness. On June 8, 1911, Curtiss received U.S. Pilot&#x27;s License #1 from the Aero Club of America, because the first batch of licenses were issued in alphabetical order; Wilbur Wright received license #5. At the culmination of the Aerial Experiment Association&#x27;s experiments, Curtiss offered to purchase the rights to Aerodrome #3, essentially using it as the basis of his Curtiss No. 1, the first of his production series of pusher aircraft.

=== The pre-war years ===

==== Aviation competitions ====
After a 1909 fall-out with the AEA, Curtiss joined with A. M. Herring (and backers from the Aero Club of America) to found the Herring-Curtiss Company in Hammondsport. During the 1909–1910 period, Curtiss employed a number of demonstration pilots, including Eugene Ely, Charles K. Hamilton, J.A.D. McCurdy, Augustus Post, and Hugh Robinson. Aerial competitions and demonstration flights across North America helped to introduce aviation to a curious public; Curtiss took full advantage of these occasions to promote his products. This was a busy period for Glenn Curtiss.

In August 1909, Curtiss took part in the &quot;Grande Semaine d&#x27;Aviation&quot; aviation meeting at Reims, France, organized by the Aéro-Club de France. The Wrights, who were selling their machines to customers in Germany at the time, decided not to compete in person. Two Wright aircraft (modified with a landing gear) were at the meet, but they did not win any events. On August 28, 1909, flying his No. 2 biplane, Curtiss won the overall speed event, the Gordon Bennett Cup, completing the 20-km (12.5-mile) course in just under 16 minutes at a speed of , six seconds faster than runner-up Louis Blériot.

On May 29, 1910, Curtiss flew from Albany to New York City to make the first long-distance flight between two major cities in the U.S. For this flight, which he completed in just under four hours including one stop to refuel, he won a $10,000 prize offered by publisher Joseph Pulitzer and was awarded permanent possession of the Scientific American Trophy.

In June 1910, Curtiss provided a simulated bombing demonstration to naval officers at Hammondsport. Two months later, Lt. Jacob E. Fickel demonstrated the feasibility of shooting at targets on the ground from an aircraft with Curtiss serving as pilot. One month later, in September, he trained Blanche Stuart Scott, who was possibly the first American woman pilot. The fictional character Tom Swift, who first appeared in 1910 in &quot;Tom Swift and His Motor Cycle&quot; and &quot;Tom Swift and His Airship&quot;, has been said to have been based on Glenn Curtiss. The Tom Swift books are set in a small town on a lake in upstate New York.

=== Patent dispute ===

A patent lawsuit by the Wright brothers against Curtiss in 1909 continued until it was resolved during World War I. Since the last Wright aircraft, the Wright Model L, was a single prototype of a &quot;scouting&quot; aircraft, made in 1916, the U.S. government, desperately short of combat aircraft, pressured both firms to resolve the dispute. Of nine suits Wright brought against Curtiss and others and the three suits brought against them, the Wright Brothers eventually won every case in courts in the United States.

=== Naval aviation ===

On November 14, 1910, Curtiss demonstration pilot Eugene Ely took off from a temporary platform mounted on the forward deck of the cruiser USS &quot;Birmingham&quot;. His successful takeoff and ensuing flight to shore marked the beginning of a relationship between Curtiss and the Navy that remained significant for decades.
At the end of 1910, Curtiss established a winter encampment at San Diego to teach flying to Army and Naval personnel. Here, he trained Lt. Theodore Ellyson, who became U.S. Naval Aviator #1, and three Army officers, 1st Lt. Paul W. Beck, 2nd Lt. George E. M. Kelly, and 2nd Lt. John C. Walker Jr., in the first military aviation school. (Chikuhei Nakajima, founder of Nakajima Aircraft Company, was a 1912 graduate.) The original site of this winter encampment is now part of Naval Air Station North Island and is referred to by the Navy as &quot;The Birthplace of Naval Aviation&quot;.

Through the course of that winter, Curtiss was able to develop a float (pontoon) design that enabled him to take off and land on water. On January 26, 1911, he flew the first seaplane from the water in the United States. Demonstrations of this advanced design were of great interest to the Navy, but more significant, as far as the Navy was concerned, was Eugene Ely successfully landing his Curtiss pusher (the same aircraft used to take off from the &quot;Birmingham&quot;) on a makeshift platform mounted on the rear deck of the battleship USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. This was the first arrester-cable landing on a ship and the precursor of modern-day carrier operations. On January 28, 1911, Ellyson took off in a Curtiss &quot;grass cutter&quot; to become the first Naval aviator.
Curtiss custom built floats and adapted them onto a Model D so it could take off and land on water to prove the concept. On February 24, 1911, Curtiss made his first amphibious demonstration at North Island by taking off and alighting on both land and water. Back in Hammondsport, six months later in July 1911, Curtiss sold the U.S. Navy their first aircraft, the A-1 &quot;Triad&quot;. The A-1, which was primarily a seaplane, was equipped with retractable wheels, also making it the first amphibious aircraft. Curtiss trained the Navy&#x27;s first pilots and built their first aircraft. For this, he is considered in the US to be &quot;The Father of Naval Aviation&quot;. The Triad was immediately recognized as so obviously useful, it was purchased by the U.S. Navy, Russia, Japan, Germany, and Britain. Curtiss won the Collier Trophy for designing this aircraft.

Henry Kleckler, considered Curtiss&#x27; &quot;right hand man&quot;, and a &quot;master innovator and mechanic&quot;, was also a native of Hammondsport and worked with Curtiss in developing more efficient engines for the &quot;flying boats&quot; pioneered and developed by Curtiss.

Around this time, Curtiss met retired British naval officer John Cyril Porte, who was looking for a partner to produce an aircraft with him to win the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; prize for the first transatlantic crossing. In 1912, Curtiss produced the two-seat &quot;Flying Fish&quot;, a larger craft that became classified as a flying boat because the hull sat in the water; it featured an innovative notch (known as a &quot;step&quot;) in the hull that Porte recommended for breaking clear of the water at takeoff. Curtiss correctly surmised that this configuration was more suited to building a larger long-distance craft that could operate from water, and was also more stable when operating from a choppy surface. With the backing of Rodman Wanamaker, Porte and Curtiss produced the &quot;America&quot; in 1914, a larger flying boat with two engines, for the transatlantic crossing.

== World War I and later ==

=== World War I ===
With the start of World War I, Porte returned to service in the Royal Navy, which subsequently purchased several models of the &quot;America&quot;, now called the H-4, from Curtiss. Porte licensed and further developed the designs, constructing a range of Felixstowe long-range patrol aircraft, and from his experience passed along improvements to the hull to Curtiss. The later British designs were sold to the U.S. forces, or built by Curtiss as the F5L. The Curtiss factory also built a total of 68 &quot;Large Americas&quot;, which evolved into the H-12, the only American designed and built aircraft to see combat in World War I.

As 1916 approached, the United States was feared to be drawn into the conflict. The Army&#x27;s Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps ordered the development of a simple, easy-to-fly-and-maintain, two-seat trainer. Curtiss created the JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; for the Army, and the N-9 seaplane version for the Navy, designed as a trainer. They were some of the most famous products of the Curtiss company, and thousands were sold to the militaries of the United States, Canada, and Britain. Civilian and military aircraft demand boomed, and the company grew to employ 18,000 workers in Buffalo and 3,000 workers in Hammondsport.

In 1917, the U.S. Navy commissioned Curtiss to design a long-range, four-engined flying boat large enough to hold a crew of five, which became known as the Curtiss NC. Three of the four NC flying boats built attempted a transatlantic crossing in 1919. Thus NC-4 became the first aircraft to be flown across the Atlantic Ocean, (a feat quickly overshadowed by the first non-stop Atlantic crossing by Alcock and Brown,) while NC-1 and NC-3 were unable to continue past the Azores. NC-4 is now on permanent display in the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola, Florida.

=== Post-World War I ===
Peace brought cancellation of wartime contracts. In September 1920, the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company underwent a financial reorganization. Glenn Curtiss cashed out his stock in the company for $32 million and retired to Florida. He continued on as a director of the company, but served only as an adviser on design. Clement M. Keys gained control of the company, which later became the nucleus of a large group of aviation companies.

=== Later years ===

Curtiss and his family moved to Florida in the 1920s, where he founded 18 corporations, served on civic commissions, and donated extensive land and water rights. He co-developed the city of Hialeah with James Bright and developed the cities of Opa-locka and Miami Springs, where he built a family home, known variously as the Miami Springs Villas House, Dar-Err-Aha, MSTR No. 2, or Glenn Curtiss House. The Glenn Curtiss House, after years of disrepair and frequent vandalism, is being refurbished to serve as a museum in his honor.

His frequent hunting trips into the Florida Everglades led to a final invention, the Adams Motor &quot;Bungalo&quot;, a forerunner of the modern recreational vehicle trailer (named after his business partner and half-brother, G. Carl Adams). Curtiss later developed this into a larger, more elaborate fifth-wheel vehicle, which he manufactured and sold under the name Aerocar. Shortly before his death, he designed a tailless aircraft with a V-shaped wing and tricycle landing gear that he hoped could be sold in the price range of a family car.

The Wright Aeronautical Corporation, a successor to the original Wright Company, ultimately merged with the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company on July 5, 1929, forming the Curtiss-Wright company, shortly before Curtiss&#x27;s death.

==Controversies==
Curtiss, working with the head of the Smithsonian Institution Charles Walcott, sought to discredit the Wrights and rehabilitate the reputation of Samuel Langley, a former head of the Smithsonian, who failed in his attempt at powered flight. Secretly, Curtiss extensively modified Langley&#x27;s 1903 aerodrome (aircraft) then demonstrated in 1914 that it could fly. In turn, the Smithsonian endorsed the false statement that &quot;Professor Samuel P. Langley had actually designed and built the first man-carrying flying machine capable of sustained flight.&quot; Walcott ordered the plane modified by Curtiss to be returned to its original 1903 condition before going on display at the Smithsonian to cover up the deception. In 1928 the Smithsonian Board of Regents reversed its position and acknowledged that the Wright Brothers deserved the credit for the first flight.

==Death==
Traveling to Rochester to contest a lawsuit brought by former business partner August Herring, Curtiss suffered an attack of appendicitis in court. He died on July 23, 1930, in Buffalo, New York, of complications from an appendectomy. His funeral service was held at St. James Episcopal Church in his home town, Hammondsport, with interment in the family plot at Pleasant Valley Cemetery in Hammondsport.

==Awards and honors==
By an act of Congress on March 1, 1933, Curtiss was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, which now resides in the Smithsonian Institution. Curtiss was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1964, the International Aerospace Hall of Fame in 1965, the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1990, the Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1998, and the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2003. The Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum has a collection of Curtiss&#x27;s original documents as well as a collection of airplanes, motorcycles and motors. LaGuardia Airport was originally called Glenn H. Curtiss Airport when it began operation in 1929.
Other Curtiss honors include: Naval Aviation Hall of Honor; OX-5 Aviation Pioneers Hall of Fame; Empire State Aviation Hall of Fame; Niagara Frontier Aviation and Space Hall of Fame; International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame; Long Island Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame; Great Floridians 2000; Steuben County (NY) Hall of Fame; Hammondsport School Lifetime Achievements Wall of Fame; Florida Aviation Hall of Fame; Smithsonian Institution Langley Medal; Top 100 Stars of Aerospace and Aviation; Doctor of Science (&quot;honoris causa&quot;), University of Miami.

The Glenn H. Curtiss Museum in Hammondsport is dedicated to Curtiss&#x27; life and work. 
Curtiss&#x27; famed airplane appeared on a 1918 issue U. S. airmail stamp. along with fifteen other US airmail stamps, (including the first air mail stamps), and on the stamps of at least 17 other countries. Curtiss himself appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; in 1924.

<text>Socrates Sculpture Park is an outdoor museum and public park where artists can create and exhibit sculptures and multi-media installations. It is located one block from the Noguchi Museum at the intersection of Broadway and Vernon Boulevard in the neighborhood of Astoria, Queens, New York City. In addition to exhibition space, the park offers an arts education program, artist residency program, and job training.

==History and description==

Socrates Sculpture Park is located atop the mouth of the buried Sunswick Creek. In 1986, American sculptor Mark di Suvero created Socrates Sculpture Park on an abandoned landfill and illegal dumpsite in Long Island City. The site is the largest outdoor space in New York City dedicated to exhibiting sculpture. The former landfill was renovated into the current park by a team of contemporary artists and local youths. The park operated for 14 years with only a temporary city park status. In 1998, the park was given official status by then New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani as a permanent city park after a developer attempted to erect luxury apartments and a marina on the site after the park&#x27;s lease had expired.

In 2005, the park was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.

At the Socrates Sculpture Park&#x27;s main entrance hangs a billboard structure that has been an ongoing installation since 1999. The original billboard was a mirror image of the street created by artist Mathieu Borysevicz built by ongoing volunteer Ross H. Radtke, a mechanical engineer and neighbour.

New billboards are installed once or twice per year. Artists work with printmaking and photography to create an image that greets visitors as they enter the park and sets the tone for the current show. The billboards are in conjunction with each spring exhibition.
The park has numerous workshops and public programming. Many artists lead tour programs of current exhibitions, there are summer art projects, and various free public events, such as yoga and capoeira on Saturdays and outdoor movie screenings on Wednesdays that begin in mid-July and end in mid-August. GrowNYC runs an Astoria Farmer&#x27;s Market in the park every Saturday during the summer months.

In January 2019, the Park announced its plan to construct and install permanent staff offices made out of shipping containers. This would be the park&#x27;s first permanent on-site structure.

==Artists who have exhibited at Socrates Sculpture Park==
Socrates Sculpture Park offers emerging and established artists an opportunity to make a temporary or permanent public sculpture in a New York City park. In 2018, Virginia Overton became the first female artist to have a solo exhibition at the Socrates Sculpture Park. Other artists who have shown work at Socrates Sculpture Park include:
*Vito Acconci 1986
*Maren Hassinger 1988, 2022
*Merle Temkin 1991
*Sanford Biggers 2001
*Agnes Denes 2015
*Virginia Overton 2018
*Guadalupe Maravilla 2021
*Mary Mattingly 2023

==Governance==

The current executive director of the park is John Hatfield, former deputy director of the New Museum of Contemporary Art. Some former executive directors of the park include Alyson Baker (2000–2011), Kathleen Gilrain (1995–2000), and Eve Sussman (1993- ).

<text>An airfoil (American English) or aerofoil (British English) is a streamlined body that is capable of generating significantly more lift than drag. Wings, sails and propeller blades are examples of airfoils. Foils of similar function designed with water as the working fluid are called hydrofoils.

When oriented at a suitable angle, a solid body moving through a fluid deflects the oncoming fluid (for fixed-wing aircraft, a downward force), resulting in a force on the airfoil in the direction opposite to the deflection. This force is known as aerodynamic force and can be resolved into two components: lift (perpendicular to the remote freestream velocity) and drag (parallel to the freestream velocity).

The lift on an airfoil is primarily the result of its angle of attack. Most foil shapes require a positive angle of attack to generate lift, but cambered airfoils can generate lift at zero angle of attack. Airfoils can be designed for use at different speeds by modifying their geometry: those for subsonic flight generally have a rounded leading edge, while those designed for supersonic flight tend to be slimmer with a sharp leading edge. All have a sharp trailing edge.

The air deflected by an airfoil causes it to generate a lower-pressure &quot;shadow&quot; above and behind itself. This pressure difference is accompanied by a velocity difference, via Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, so the resulting flowfield about the airfoil has a higher average velocity on the upper surface than on the lower surface. In some situations (e.g., inviscid potential flow) the lift force can be related directly to the average top/bottom velocity difference without computing the pressure by using the concept of circulation and the Kutta–Joukowski theorem.

==Overview==

The wings and stabilizers of fixed-wing aircraft, as well as helicopter rotor blades, are built with airfoil-shaped cross sections. Airfoils are also found in propellers, fans, compressors and turbines. Sails are also airfoils, and the underwater surfaces of sailboats, such as the centerboard, rudder, and keel, are similar in cross-section and operate on the same principles as airfoils. Swimming and flying creatures and even many plants and sessile organisms employ airfoils/hydrofoils, common examples being bird wings, the bodies of fish, and the shape of sand dollars. An airfoil-shaped wing can create downforce on an automobile or other motor vehicle, improving traction.

When the wind is obstructed by an object such as a flat plate, a building, or the deck of a bridge, the object will experience drag and also an aerodynamic force perpendicular to the wind. This does not mean the object qualifies as an airfoil. Airfoils are highly-efficient lifting shapes, able to generate more lift than similarly sized flat plates of the same area, and able to generate lift with significantly less drag. Airfoils are used in the design of aircraft, propellers, rotor blades, wind turbines and other applications of aeronautical engineering.

A lift and drag curve obtained in wind tunnel testing is shown on the right. The curve represents an airfoil with a positive camber so some lift is produced at zero angle of attack. With increased angle of attack, lift increases in a roughly linear relation, called the &quot;slope&quot; of the lift curve. At about 18 degrees this airfoil stalls, and lift falls off quickly beyond that. The drop in lift can be explained by the action of the upper-surface boundary layer, which separates and greatly thickens over the upper surface at and past the stall angle. The thickened boundary layer&#x27;s displacement thickness changes the airfoil&#x27;s effective shape, in particular it reduces its effective camber, which modifies the overall flow field so as to reduce the circulation and the lift. The thicker boundary layer also causes a large increase in pressure drag, so that the overall drag increases sharply near and past the stall point.

Airfoil design is a major facet of aerodynamics. Various airfoils serve different flight regimes. Asymmetric airfoils can generate lift at zero angle of attack, while a symmetric airfoil may better suit frequent inverted flight as in an aerobatic airplane. In the region of the ailerons and near a wingtip a symmetric airfoil can be used to increase the range of angles of attack to avoid spin–stall. Thus a large range of angles can be used without boundary layer separation. Subsonic airfoils have a round leading edge, which is naturally insensitive to the angle of attack. The cross section is not strictly circular, however: the radius of curvature is increased before the wing achieves maximum thickness to minimize the chance of boundary layer separation. This elongates the wing and moves the point of maximum thickness back from the leading edge.

Supersonic airfoils are much more angular in shape and can have a very sharp leading edge, which is very sensitive to angle of attack. A supercritical airfoil has its maximum thickness close to the leading edge to have a lot of length to slowly shock the supersonic flow back to subsonic speeds. Generally such transonic airfoils and also the supersonic airfoils have a low camber to reduce drag divergence. Modern aircraft wings may have different airfoil sections along the wing span, each one optimized for the conditions in each section of the wing.

Movable high-lift devices, flaps and sometimes slats, are fitted to airfoils on almost every aircraft. A trailing edge flap acts similarly to an aileron; however, it, as opposed to an aileron, can be retracted partially into the wing if not used.

A laminar flow wing has a maximum thickness in the middle camber line. Analyzing the Navier–Stokes equations in the linear regime shows that a negative pressure gradient along the flow has the same effect as reducing the speed. So with the maximum camber in the middle, maintaining a laminar flow over a larger percentage of the wing at a higher cruising speed is possible. However, some surface contamination will disrupt the laminar flow, making it turbulent. For example, with rain on the wing, the flow will be turbulent. Under certain conditions, insect debris on the wing will cause the loss of small regions of laminar flow as well. Before NASA&#x27;s research in the 1970s and 1980s the aircraft design community understood from application attempts in the WW II era that laminar flow wing designs were not practical using common manufacturing tolerances and surface imperfections. That belief changed after new manufacturing methods were developed with composite materials (e.g. laminar-flow airfoils developed by Professor Franz Wortmann for use with wings made of fibre-reinforced plastic). Machined metal methods were also introduced. NASA&#x27;s research in the 1980s revealed the practicality and usefulness of laminar flow wing designs and opened the way for laminar-flow applications on modern practical aircraft surfaces, from subsonic general aviation aircraft to transonic large transport aircraft, to supersonic designs.

Schemes have been devised to define airfoils – an example is the NACA system. Various airfoil generation systems are also used. An example of a general purpose airfoil that finds wide application, and pre–dates the NACA system, is the Clark-Y. Today, airfoils can be designed for specific functions by the use of computer programs.

== Airfoil terminology ==
The various terms related to airfoils are defined below:

*The &quot;suction surface&quot; (a.k.a. upper surface) is generally associated with higher velocity and lower static pressure.
*The &quot;pressure surface&quot; (a.k.a. lower surface) has a comparatively higher static pressure than the suction surface. The pressure gradient between these two surfaces contributes to the lift force generated for a given airfoil.

The geometry of the airfoil is described with a variety of terms :

*The &quot;leading edge&quot; is the point at the front of the airfoil that has maximum curvature (minimum radius).
*The &quot;trailing edge&quot; is the point on the airfoil most remote from the leading edge. The angle between the upper and lower surfaces at the trailing edge is the &quot;trailing edge angle&quot;.
*The &quot;chord line&quot; is the straight line connecting leading and trailing edges. The &quot;chord length&quot;, or simply chord, formula_1, is the length of the chord line. That is the reference dimension of the airfoil section.

The shape of the airfoil is defined using the following geometrical parameters:
*The &quot;mean camber line&quot; or &quot;mean line&quot; is the locus of points midway between the upper and lower surfaces. Its shape depends on the thickness distribution along the chord;
*The &quot;thickness&quot; of an airfoil varies along the chord. It may be measured in either of two ways:
** Thickness measured perpendicular to the camber line. This is sometimes described as the &quot;American convention&quot;;
** Thickness measured perpendicular to the chord line. This is sometimes described as the &quot;British convention&quot;.

Some important parameters to describe an airfoil&#x27;s shape are its &quot;camber&quot; and its &quot;thickness&quot;. For example, an airfoil of the NACA 4-digit series such as the NACA 2415 (to be read as 2 – 4 – 15) describes an airfoil with a camber of 0.02 chord located at 0.40 chord, with 0.15 chord of maximum thickness.

Finally, important concepts used to describe the airfoil&#x27;s behaviour when moving through a fluid are:
*The &quot;aerodynamic center&quot;, which is the chord-wise location about which the pitching moment is independent of the lift coefficient and the angle of attack.
*The &quot;center of pressure&quot;, which is the chord-wise location about which the &quot;pitching moment&quot; is momentarily zero. On a cambered airfoil, the center of pressure is not a fixed location as it moves in response to changes in angle of attack and lift coefficient.

In two-dimensional flow around a uniform wing of infinite span, the slope of the lift curve is determined primarily by the &quot;trailing edge angle&quot;. The slope is greatest if the angle is zero; and decreases as the angle increases. For a wing of finite span, the aspect ratio of the wing also significantly influences the slope of the curve. As aspect ratio decreases, the slope also decreases.

==Thin airfoil theory==

Thin airfoil theory is a simple theory of airfoils that relates angle of attack to lift for incompressible, inviscid flows. It was devised by German mathematician Max Munk and further refined by British aerodynamicist Hermann Glauert and others in the 1920s. The theory idealizes the flow around an airfoil as two-dimensional flow around a thin airfoil. It can be imagined as addressing an airfoil of zero thickness and infinite wingspan.

Thin airfoil theory was particularly notable in its day because it provided a sound theoretical basis for the following important properties of airfoils in two-dimensional inviscid flow:
# on a symmetric airfoil, the center of pressure and aerodynamic center are coincident and lie exactly one quarter of the chord behind the leading edge.
# on a cambered airfoil, the aerodynamic center lies exactly one quarter of the chord behind the leading edge, but the position of the center of pressure moves when the angle of attack changes.
# the slope of the &quot;lift coefficient versus angle of attack&quot; line is formula_2 units per radian.

As a consequence of (3), the section lift coefficient of a thin symmetric airfoil of infinite wingspan is:
:formula_3
:where formula_4 is the section lift coefficient,
:formula_5 is the angle of attack in radians, measured relative to the chord line.
(The above expression is also applicable to a cambered airfoil where formula_5 is the angle of attack measured relative to the zero-lift line instead of the chord line.)

Also as a consequence of (3), the section lift coefficient of a cambered airfoil of infinite wingspan is:
:formula_7
:where formula_8 is the section lift coefficient when the angle of attack is zero.

Thin airfoil theory assumes the air is an inviscid fluid so does not account for the stall of the airfoil, which usually occurs at an angle of attack between 10° and 15° for typical airfoils. In the mid-late 2000s, however, a theory predicting the onset of leading-edge stall was proposed by Wallace J. Morris II in his doctoral thesis. Morris&#x27;s subsequent refinements contain the details on the current state of theoretical knowledge on the leading-edge stall phenomenon. Morris&#x27;s theory predicts the critical angle of attack for leading-edge stall onset as the condition at which a global separation zone is predicted in the solution for the inner flow. Morris&#x27;s theory demonstrates that a subsonic flow about a thin airfoil can be described in terms of an outer region, around most of the airfoil chord, and an inner region, around the nose, that asymptotically match each other. As the flow in the outer region is dominated by classical thin airfoil theory, Morris&#x27;s equations exhibit many components of thin airfoil theory.

=== Derivation ===
In thin airfoil theory, the width of the (2D) airfoil is assumed negligible, and the airfoil itself replaced with a 1D blade along its camber line, oriented at the angle of attack . Let the position along the blade be , ranging from at the wing&#x27;s front to at the trailing edge; the camber of the airfoil, , is assumed sufficiently small that one need not distinguish between and position relative to the fuselage.

The flow across the airfoil generates a circulation around the blade, which can be modeled as a vortex sheet of position-varying strength . The Kutta condition implies that , but the strength is singular at the bladefront, with for . If the main flow has density , then the Kutta–Joukowski theorem gives that the total lift force is proportional to formula_9and its moment about the leading edge proportional to formula_10

From the Biot–Savart law, the vorticity produces a flow field formula_11 oriented normal to the airfoil at . Since the airfoil is an impermeable surface, the flow formula_12 must balance an inverse flow from . By the small-angle approximation, is inclined at angle relative to the blade at position , and the normal component is correspondingly . Thus, must satisfy the convolution equation formula_13 which uniquely determines it in terms of known quantities.

An explicit solution can be obtained through first the change of variablesformula_14and then expanding both and as a nondimensionalized Fourier series in with a modified lead term:formula_15 The resulting lift and moment depend on only the first few terms of this series.

The lift coefficient satisfies formula_16 and the moment coefficient formula_17 The moment about the 1/4 chord point will thus be formula_18 From this it follows that the center of pressure is aft of the &#x27;quarter-chord&#x27; point , by formula_19 The aerodynamic center is the position at which the pitching moment does not &quot;vary&quot; with a change in lift coefficient: formula_20
Thin-airfoil theory shows that, in two-dimensional inviscid flow, the aerodynamic center is at the quarter-chord position.

<text>The Quintuple Alliance came into being at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, when France joined the Quadruple Alliance created by Austria, Prussia, the Russian Empire, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The European peace settlement concluded at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. 

After following the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (in Aachen), the Alliance powers met thrice: in 1820 at the Congress of Troppau (Opava), in 1821 at the Congress of Laibach (Ljubljana), and in 1822 at the Congress of Verona. 

While Britain stood largely aloof from the Alliance&#x27;s illiberal actions, the four continental monarchies were successful in authorising Austrian military action in Italy in 1821 and French intervention in Spain in 1823.

The Alliance is conventionally taken to have become defunct along with the Holy Alliance of the three original continental members following the death of Emperor Alexander I of Russia in 1825. Despite the Alliance&#x27;s dissolution, the Great Powers of France, Britain, and Russia would go on to intervene in the Battle of Navarino.

<text>The Holy Alliance (; ), also called the Grand Alliance, was a coalition linking the absolute monarchist great powers of Austria, Prussia, and Russia, which was created after the final defeat of Napoleon at the behest of Emperor Alexander I of Russia and signed in Paris on 26 September 1815.

The alliance aimed to restrain liberalism in Europe in the wake of the devastating French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars; it nominally succeeded in this until the Crimean War. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck managed to reunite the Holy Alliance, as League of the Three Emperors, following the unification of Germany in 1871; the alliance again faltered by the 1880s over Austrian and Russian conflicts of interest over the decline of the Ottoman Empire.

==Establishment==
Ostensibly, the alliance was formed to instil the divine right of kings and Christian values in European political life, as pursued by Alexander I under the influence of his spiritual adviser Baroness Barbara von Krüdener. It was written by Emperor Alexander I of Russia and edited by Ioannis Kapodistrias and Alexandru Sturdza. Under the treaty European rulers would agree to govern as &quot;branches&quot; of the Christian community and offer mutual service. In the first draft, Emperor Alexander I made appeals to mysticism through a proposed unified Christian empire that was seen as disconcerting by the other monarchies. Following revision, a more pragmatic version of the alliance was adopted by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The document was called &quot;an apocalypse of diplomacy&quot; by French diplomat Dominique-Georges-Frédéric Dufour de Pradt. 

The agreement was at first secret, and mistrusted by liberals though liberalism was effectively restrained in this political culture until the Revolutions of 1848. About three months after the Final Act of the Congress of Vienna, the monarchs of Catholic (Austria), Protestant (Prussia), and Orthodox (Russia) confession promised to act on the basis of &quot;justice, love, and peace&quot;, both in internal and foreign affairs, for &quot;consolidating human institutions and remedying their imperfections&quot;. The Alliance was quickly rejected by the United Kingdom (though George IV declared consent in his capacity as King of Hanover), the Papal States, and the Ottoman Empire. Lord Castlereagh, the British Foreign Secretary, called it &quot;a piece of sublime mysticism and nonsense&quot;. Nonetheless, Britain participated in the Concert of Europe.

==Organization==
In practice, the Austrian state chancellor and foreign minister, Prince Klemens von Metternich made it a bastion against democracy and citizen-nationalism. It also allowed coordinating suppression of Polish efforts to restore an independent state, by Austria in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, by Russia in its Congress Poland and by Prussia in the Grand Duchy of Posen and in West Prussia. 

The Alliance is usually associated with the later Quadruple and Quintuple Alliances, which included the United Kingdom and (from 1818) France with the aim of upholding the European peace settlement and balance of power in the Concert of Europe concluded at the Congress of Vienna. On 29 September 1818, Alexander, Emperor Francis I of Austria and King Frederick William III of Prussia met with the Duke of Wellington, Viscount Castlereagh and the Duc de Richelieu at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle to demand stern measures against university &quot;demagogues&quot;, which would be realized in the Carlsbad Decrees of the following year. At the Congress of Troppau in 1820 and the succeeding Congress of Laibach in 1821, Metternich tried to align his allies in the suppression of the Carbonari revolt against King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. The Quintuple Alliance met for the last time at the Congress of Verona in 1822 to advise against the Greek Revolution and to resolve upon the French invasion of Spain.

The last meetings had revealed the rising antagonism between Britain and France, especially on Italian unification, the right to self-determination, and the Eastern Question. The Alliance is conventionally taken to have become defunct with Alexander&#x27;s death in 1825. France ultimately went her separate way following the July Revolution of 1830, leaving the core of Austria, Prussia, and Russia as a Central-Eastern European block which once again congregated to suppress the Revolutions of 1848. The Austro-Russian alliance finally broke up in the Crimean War. Though Russia had helped to suppress the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, Austria did not take any action to support her ally, declared herself neutral, and even occupied the Danubian Principalities upon the Russian retreat in 1854. Thereafter, Austria remained isolated, which added to the loss of her leading role in the German states, culminating in her defeat during the Austro-Prussian War in 1866.

<doc id="290072" wikidata="Q1840662" url="?curid=290072" title="Atari XEGS">
<text>The Atari XE Video Game System (Atari XEGS) is an industrial redesign of the Atari 65XE home computer and the final model in the Atari 8-bit computer series. It was released by Atari Corporation in 1987 and marketed as a home video game console alongside the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega&#x27;s Master System, and Atari&#x27;s own Atari 7800. The XEGS is compatible with existing Atari 8-bit computer hardware and software. Without keyboard, the system operates as a stand-alone game console. With the keyboard, it boots identically to the Atari XE computers. Atari packaged the XEGS as a basic set consisting of only the console and joystick, and as a deluxe set consisting of the console, keyboard, CX40 joystick, and XG-1 light gun.

The XEGS release was backed by new games, including &quot;Barnyard Blaster&quot; and &quot;Bug Hunt&quot;, plus cartridge ports of older games, such as &quot;Fight Night&quot; (Accolade, 1985), &quot;Lode Runner&quot; (Broderbund, 1983), &quot;Necromancer&quot; (Synapse Software, 1982), and &quot;Ballblazer&quot; (Lucasfilm Games, 1985). Support for the system was dropped in 1992 along with the rest of the 8-bit computer line, the Atari 2600, and the Atari 7800.

==Development==


In 1984, following the video game crash of 1983 when Atari, Inc. had great financial difficulties as a division of Warner Communications, John J. Anderson of &quot;Creative Computing&quot; stated that Atari should have released a video game console in 1981 based on its Atari 8-bit computers and compatible with that software library. The company instead released the Atari 5200, which is based on the 8-bit computers but is incompatible with their software.

After Jack Tramiel purchased the company, Atari Corporation re-released two game consoles in 1986: the Atari 7800, which had previously been released in a brief test run in 1984; and a lower cost redesign of the Atari 2600.

Atari conceived the console in a plan to increase the company&#x27;s console market share while improving sales of its 8-bit home computer family which had started with the Atari 400 and 800. Providing a &quot;beginning computer&quot; and &quot;sophisticated game console&quot; in one device, was thought to convince more retailers and software developers to support the platform. Matthew Ratcliff, who had been contributing editor for &quot;Antic&quot; magazine, recalled that &quot;Atari executives asked the heads of several major toy store chains which product they&#x27;d rather sellthe powerful 65XE home computer for about , or a fancy new game system for about . The answer was, &#x27;You can keep the computer, give us that game machine!&quot; In May 1987, Atari&#x27;s Director of Communications, Neil Harris, updated the online Atari community by outlining this plan, noting that the XEGS was intended to further the 8-bit line by providing mass-merchants with a device that was more appealing to their markets.

The XEGS is a repackaged Atari 65XE home computer, compatible with the existing range of Atari 8-bit computer software and peripherals, and thus can function as a home computer. At a more premium , it co-existed with the Atari 7800 and remodeled Atari 2600, and was occasionally featured alongside those systems in Atari print ads and television commercials.

Atari Corporation discontinued their 8-bit product line, including the XEGS, in December 1991.

==Games==

The XEGS shipped with the Atari 8-bit version of &quot;Missile Command&quot; built in, &quot;Flight Simulator II&quot; bundled with the keyboard component, and &quot;Bug Hunt&quot; which is compatible with the light gun. As the XEGS is compatible with the earlier 8-bit software, many games released under the XEGS banner are simply older games rebadged. This was done to the extent that some games were shipped in the old Atari 400/800 packaging, bearing only a new sticker to indicate that they are also compatible with the XEGS.

==Peripherals==
The XEGS was released in a basic set and a deluxe set. The basic set includes only the console, and a standard CX40 joystick with a grey base to match the XEGS rather than its original black. The deluxe set consists of the console, the CX40 joystick, a keyboard which enables home computer functionality, and the XG-1 light gun. The keyboard and light gun were also released separately outside North America. This is the first light gun produced by Atari, and it is also compatible with the Atari 7800 and Atari 2600.

The system can use Atari 8-bit computer peripherals, such as disk drives, modems, and printers.

==Reception==
Atari sold 100,000 XE Game Systems during the Christmas season in 1987, every unit that was produced during its launch window. Matthew Ratcliff called the game and computer combination &quot;a brilliant idea&quot;, which &quot;has been selling out almost as fast as toy stores can get them in&quot;. He said, &quot;The XEGS may not seem like such a hot idea to serious Atari computer users. But just think about it. If you were afraid of computers or don&#x27;t have the foggiest idea what to do with one, you&#x27;d have absolutely no interest in an Atari 65XEeven if it could play great games. However, you&#x27;d probably have no compunction about buying a great video game system, the XEGS, as a new addition to the family entertainment center.&quot; In 1988, he wrote in &quot;Antic&quot; magazine that, to switch between light gun and joystick games, active XEGS gamers are frustrated by the need to continually re-plug their devices and power cycle the system, due to the system&#x27;s lack of autodetection, which is complicated by its awkwardly downward slanting ports. He said &quot;&quot;Barnyard Blaster&quot; and &quot;Bug Hunt&quot; could have been just a bit smarter&quot; by including the simple routine that he was forced to write and publish as a workaround.

<doc id="290082" wikidata="Q508014" url="?curid=290082" title="French Sudan">
<text>French Sudan (; &quot;&quot;) was a French colonial territory in the Federation of French West Africa from around 1880 until 1959, when it joined the Mali Federation, and then in 1960, when it became the independent state of Mali. The colony was formally called French Sudan from 1890 until 1899 and then again from 1921 until 1958, and had a variety of different names over the course of its existence. The colony was initially established largely as a military project led by French troops, but in the mid-1890s it came under civilian administration.

A number of administrative reorganizations in the early 1900s brought increasing French administration over issues like agriculture, religion, and slavery. Following World War II, the African Democratic Rally (RDA) under Modibo Keïta became the most significant political force pushing for independence.

French Sudan initially retained close connections with France and joined in a short-lived federation with Senegal in 1959, but ties to both countries quickly weakened. In 1960, the French Sudan formally became the Republic of Mali and began to distance itself further from Senegal and France.

==Colonial establishment==
French Sudan was formed as a set of military outposts as an extension of the French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was partly due to a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and partly due to the promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for French military personnel.

French conquest began in 1879, when Joseph Gallieni was dispatched to the area to establish a fort and survey the land for a railroad from Dakar in Senegal to the Niger River. This was followed with the establishment of a number of French forts and political alliances with specific leaders in the region in the early 1880s. The administrative structure of the area was still largely under control of the French Governor of Senegal, and the most significant colonization were simply the military forts and outposts, including the important one established at Kayes in 1881 by Gustave Borgnis-Desbordes. Though the civilian administration of the French governor of Senegal formally ruled the area, military officers in the region largely bypassed these leaders and answered directly to commanding officers in Paris. Desbordes gradually took over more territory, often using inter-ethnic rivalries and political tension among leaders in the area to appoint French-supportive leaders.

French civilian administrators struggled with the military leaders, and the two forces went through a number of leadership changes over the territory, until Louis Archinard was appointed military governor in 1892. Archinard led military campaigns against Samori Ture, Ahmadu Tall, and other resistant leaders in the region, with varying success. Archinard&#x27;s campaigns were often executed through direct military control, without civilian oversight. As costs increased, the French administration decided to replace Archinard&#x27;s control over the area with a civilian governor, Louis Albert Grodet.

==Administration and jurisdiction==


The region was governed under a number of different names between 1880 and 1960. The area was &quot;Upper River&quot; from 1880 until 18 August 1890, when it was renamed &quot;French Sudan&quot;, with its capital at Kayes. On 10 October 1899, French Sudan was divided, with the southern cercles joining coastal colonies, and the rest split into two administrative areas called &quot;Middle Niger&quot; and &quot;Upper Senegal&quot;. In 1902, the region again was organized as a unified colony under the name Senegambia and Niger (&quot;Sénégambie et Niger&quot;). The name changed again in 1904 to Upper Senegal and Niger (&quot;Haut Sénégal et Niger&quot;). Finally, in 1921, the name changed back to &quot;French Sudan&quot; (&quot;Soudan Français&quot;).

Borders and administration of the colony similarly changed a number of times. Originally, and for the initial period, the colony vacillated between military administration and civilian administration from Senegal. In 1893, French Sudan formally came under civilian administration, which lasted until 1899. At that point, a reorganization of the colony split 11 southern provinces to other French colonies like French Guinea, the Ivory Coast and Dahomey.

The area that was not reorganized was governed in two administrations linked to other French colonies. Following this, the territory of the colony was reestablished in 1902. Though the borders shifted slightly, there was little territorial change until 1933. At that point, the colony of the French Upper Volta (&quot;Haute-Volta&quot;, modern Burkina Faso) dissolved, and the northern territory was added to French Sudan.

In 1947, Upper Volta was reestablished, and the French Sudan borders became those that eventually became the borders of Mali. Kayes was the original capital city from the 1890s until 1908 when the capital moved to Bamako, where it remains.

==Agriculture==
The colony supported mostly rain-fed agriculture, with limited irrigation for its first 30 years. The only cash crops were nuts gathered close to the railroad between Kayes and Bamako. However, following successful tests of growing Egyptian cotton in West Africa during World War I, began to campaign for the construction of a large irrigation system along the Niger River. Starting in 1921, significant irrigation projects around Koulikoro and later at Baguinéda-Camp and the Ségou Cercle began to bring water. The French believed this project could rival the major cotton growing centers of Egypt and the United States.

Unlike other agricultural projects in French West Africa, the French Sudan irrigation project initially relied on families voluntarily resettling along lines established by the colonial authority. Unable to attract enough volunteers, the colonial authorities began to try forced resettlement to the cotton project. The &quot;Office du Niger&quot; was founded in 1926 as the main organization facilitating planned, irrigated agricultural projects. Farmers resisted forced resettlement and petitioned for permanent land rights to the irrigated land (which was usually held as property of the &quot;Office du Niger&quot;). Despite these efforts, a significant cash crop economy did not develop in the French Sudan.

==Religious policy==
Like much of the rest of French West Africa, the colony had a number of policies regarding Islam and the Muslim communities. The Arabic language and Islamic law were preferred in the colony by the French in the establishment of colonial government, largely because both were codified, and thus easy to standardize.

Though they maintained a formal neutrality policy in regard to religion, the French colonial administration began to regulate Islamic education in the early 1900s. In addition, fear of a pan-Islamism political rise throughout North Africa and the Sahel led the French to adopt policies that aimed to prevent the spread of Islam beyond where it already existed and to prevent Muslim leaders from governing non-Muslim communities. Indigenous religions and Christianity existed under less formal policies, and French efforts often used these to balance the spread of Islam in the region.

In the 1940s, a religious movement called &quot;Allah Koura&quot; began in the San Cercle based upon the visions of a single person. Local administrators allowed the Allah Koura movement to spread and practice, seeing it as a potential limiting influence on the spread of Islam farther south. In the late 1950s, Muslim protests and riots throughout the colony further contributed to a growing independence movement.

==Slavery policy==
The French slavery policy for much of the 19th century was inconsistent and context-dependent. Slavery had been formally outlawed in 1848, but enforcement was often non-existent. Slaves were freed in directly administered colonies in 1883, and active interdiction of slave caravans began in the 1890s. This was dependent on the military situation, however; slavery was not interfered with in allied areas, but anti-French chiefs saw their runaway slaves welcomed and settled in &quot;villages de liberte.&quot; These functioned as labor reserves for the French, however, and many former slaves left them quickly. 

In 1903, the government instructed French administrators not to use &quot;slave&quot; as an administrative category anymore and to not help masters recapture runaways. In March 1905, a slave exodus began in Banamba that preceded by six months a formal French decree ending slavery throughout French West Africa. With legal protection, almost a million slaves followed this example by moving away from their masters and settling elsewhere. The French supported these efforts by creating settlements around the Niger River and digging wells for communities elsewhere so they could farm away from their former masters.

This process affected the southern and western parts of present-day Mali most significantly, but in the northern and eastern parts of the colony large numbers of slaves remained in servitude to their masters. According to rough estimates, throughout the area of present-day Mali, about one-third of former slaves moved away from the slavery relationship, while two-thirds remained with their masters. In the 1920s, most Tuareg households still had slaves who tended to the house and animals.

Though slavery persisted, some aspects of the relationship changed with the French administration. Escaped slaves could find official protection by French authorities in the cities for a limited time. Slaves could sometimes renegotiate the terms of their servitude in the changed political situation. Some were willing to agree to remain in servitude if they received control over their family life and some land to pass to their children. In addition, the French administration actively worked to end slave raiding and the most clear manifestations of the slave trade, greatly reducing those means of acquiring slaves. However, for many decades after the 1905 abolition of slavery, the practice continued in much of French Sudan.

==Independence==

Following the passage of the Loi Cadre by the French National Assembly in 1956, many of the colonies in French West African began to hold elections to increase the self-determination of their territories. In the first elections held in French Sudan in 1957, the African Democratic Rally (&quot;Rassemblement Démocratique Africain&quot;, commonly known as the RDA) won the elections in French Sudan, as well as winning majorities in neighboring Ivory Coast, French Guinea, and the Upper Volta. Following the French constitutional referendum of 1958, which received an overwhelming majority in support, the &quot;&quot; declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 November 1958. The Sudanese Republic, as the area was now called, was the second colony after Madagascar to join the French Community, which provided it internal autonomy while linking its currency, foreign policy and defense with France.

In early January 1959, there were plans for a federation linking the Sudanese Republic with Senegal, Dahomey, and the Upper Volta in a federation of autonomous states. By April, however, neither Dahomey&#x27;s nor Upper Volta&#x27;s legislatures had ratified the federation, and so the Mali Federation was formed with only the Sudanese Republic and Senegal. In 1959, Modibo Keïta&#x27;s RDA party won all 70 seats in the legislative elections in the Sudanese Republic and joined forces with the dominant party in Senegal, headed by Léopold Sédar Senghor. The federation achieved independence on 20 June 1960 within the French Community; however, divisions between Senghor and Keïta on the governance of the federation resulted in its dissolution on 20 August 1960. The area of French Sudan formally proclaimed itself the Republic of Mali and, with increasing radicalization of Keita, left the French Community in September 1960.

<text>Kure Atoll (; ; ) or Ocean Island is an atoll in the Pacific Ocean west-northwest of Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands at . A coral ring across encloses a lagoon several meters deep. The atoll&#x27;s largest island is called &quot;Green Island&quot;, and is a habitat for hundreds of thousands of seabirds in the present day and wildlife staff. A short, unused, and unmaintained runway and a portion of one building, both from a former United States Coast Guard LORAN station, are located on the island. Politically, it is part of Hawaii, though the nearest island is Midway, which is a separate unorganized territory. Kure Atoll, in addition to being the nesting grounds for tens of thousands of seabirds, has recorded several vagrant terrestrial birds, including snow bunting, eyebrowed thrush, brambling, olive-backed pipit, black kite, Steller&#x27;s sea eagle and Chinese sparrowhawk. It is currently managed as a Wildlife Bird Sanctuary by the State of Hawaii&#x27;s Department of Land and Natural Resource–Division of Forestry and Wildlife as one of the co-trustees of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument with support from the Kure Atoll Conservancy. Kure is one of the most westernmost islands of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

Kure is seasonally inhabited by small crews of two to eight volunteers and biologists who work to restore and manage the native ecosystem.

Kure was discovered in the early 19th century and was the site of several shipwrecks. In the early 20th century it became a bird nature reserve of the United States. In the late 20th century, it was home to a radio base that supported location finding (LORAN system before GPS), and in the 21st century it is mostly a nature reserve and for scientific research. Kure, or sometimes written Cure, used to be called Ocean Island up until 1924 when it was renamed; in 1987 this changed to Kure Atoll (&quot;atoll&quot; rather than &quot;island&quot;). There are also several native Hawaiian names; some depend on context. &quot;Moku Papapa&quot; is the generic name for a flat island like this atoll but became more associated with it, and another one is &quot;Hōlanikū&quot;.

There are no more islands going west until reaching Japan, though historically it was thought there might be, none were confirmed (see phantom islands such as the Byer&#x27;s/Morrell&#x27;s islands and the Anson Archipelago). To the west and south, across a great amount of ocean, are the Bonin and Volcano Islands (such as Iwo Jima);to the southwest are Marcus (&quot;Minamitorishim&quot; (Southern Bird Island)) and Wake Island. The Aleutian island chain that extends out from Alaska lies far to the north. The nearest feature to the west, but below sea level is the Hancock bank, and many seamounts that are continuation of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain continue as it turns to the northwest: these are all submerged, and Kure is the farthest west and north islands of the Hawaiian chain above sea level in the present day. Other underwater features in the region include the Mid-Pacific Mountains, to the south, and to the north, the Hess rise (underwater features).

Hess bank to the north has the historical undersea feature the Mellish bank.

==Geography and ecology==

The International Date Line lies approximately to the west. Although located to the west of Midway Atoll, Kure Atoll has a time zone 1 hour ahead at UTC−10:00 (the same as the rest of Hawaii). Kure is the northernmost coral atoll in the world. It consists of a nearly circular barrier reef surrounding a shallow lagoon and several sand islets. There is a total land area of , with Green Island on the southeast side. A growing number of Hawaiian monk seals (&quot;Monachus schauinslandi&quot;) haul out on its beaches. The polynesian rat (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;) has been on the island since it was discovered.

The coral reef is a rough ring shape about across and has two islands within, Sand Island and Green Island. Green Island is in the southeast quadrant of the ring, with an area of 235 acres. Sand Island is about one acre in size and lies to the west of Green Island. Sand Island is not known to have plant life.

Green Island has a wide variety of vegetation including groves of Beach Naupaka (&quot;Scaevola taccada&quot;), which are a popular habitat for birds. Another type of tree on Green Island is the heliotrope tree (&quot;Tournefortia argentea&quot;), there are two groves of ironwood trees (&quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot;), and other common plants are Verbesina and Bermuda grass. A survey of plant life in 2001 counted about 50 different species of plant on Green Island.

Green Island is roughly triangular with a point to the north and with a northwest beach extending down to a western point. The east side arcs down from north point and the shore includes east beach, southeast beach, and south beach, which arcs around to West point on the south side of the island. Overall Green Island is long and up to wide. The highest point is .

Seabirds known to be at Kure in one survey:
*Black-footed Albatross (&quot;Diomedea nigripes&quot;) 
*Laysan Albatross (&quot;Diomedea immutabilis&quot;)
*Wedge-tailed Shearwater (&quot;Pufinus pacificlcs&quot;) 
*Red-tailed Tropic-bird (&quot;Phaethon rubricauda&quot;)
*Blue-faced Booby (&quot;Sula dactylatra&quot;) 
*Brown Booby (&quot;Sula Leucogaster&quot;)
*Red-footed Booby (&quot;Sula sula&quot;) 
*Great Frigate-bird (&quot;Fregata minor&quot;) 
*Gray-backed Tern (&quot;Sterna lunata&quot;) 
*Sooty Tern (&quot;Sterna fuscata&quot;)
*Noddy Tern (&quot;Anous stolidus&quot;)
*White-capped Noddy Tern (&quot;Anous minutus&quot;)
*White Tern (&quot;Gygis alba&quot;)

As of 2002, 92 species of algae have been discovered in the central lagoon of Kure Atoll.

==Geological history and future==
The geological history of Kure is generally similar to Midway, but Kure lies close to what is called the Darwin Point, the latitude north of which the rate of natural reef subsidence and destruction surpasses the rate of reef growth. At approximately 30 million years old, it is the oldest in the Hawaiian Island chain. As Kure continues to be slowly carried along to the northwest by the motion of the Pacific Plate, it will move into waters too cool for coral and coralline algae growth to keep up with isostatic subsidence of the mountain. Currently the atoll is warmed by the pools of water at the ends of the warm Kuroshio Current, keeping it in a very comfortable range in winter. Barring unforeseen evolution, it will then begin to join the other volcanic and reef-topped remnants of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain to the northwest, all of which are now seamounts.

==History==

The island was discovered in the early 19th century, and besides from shipwrecks was only occasionally visited. From the 1960s to 1992, it had LORAN radio station, which had a small staff and an airstrip. It has been a nature reserve since that time, and marine debris cleanup and scientific research on the nature is conducted.

In the Hawaiian language the term was used for any flat island with reefs. The northwestern islands are associated with Kāne Milohaʻi in Hawaiian mythology, the brother of Pele, creator of the islands, who was left to stand guard for travelers. Another Hawaiian name for Kure Atoll is , meaning &quot;bringing forth heaven.&quot;

===19th century===

Before the mid-19th century, Kure Atoll was visited by several ships and given new names each time. Sometimes spelled Cure, its English name was for a Russian navigator who sighted the atoll. It was officially named Kure Island in 1924 and then Kure Atoll in 1987. The old name for the island was Ocean Island.

Two shipwrecks in the early 19th century were the &quot;Gledstanes&quot; and the &quot;Parker&quot;, in 1837 and 1842 respectively. The &quot;Gledstanes&quot; crewmembers were able to make it to the island and then were able to build a new vessel from the debris of their old ship. Some of the survivors then sailed it back to mainland Hawaii. Once they reached Hawaii, they sent a ship back to rescue those who had stayed behind on the island. The shipwreck of the &quot;Gledstanes&quot; was found in 2008.

The &quot;Parker&#x27;s&quot; crew had a somewhat more difficult time but did manage to get to land by floating on a raft for several days. They managed to survive on a diet of birds and other wildlife at the atoll, living on what is now Green island. They even encountered the dog from the &quot;Gledstanes&quot; who had been living wild on the island in the previous years. They attempted to make contact with the outside world by attaching messages to seabirds. The &quot;Parker&quot; had shipwrecked in September 1842 and having lived at Kure Atoll, many of the crew were finally rescued on April 16, 1843, with the remainder taken off on May 2, 1843. The first rescue ship was the &quot;James Stewart&quot; and the second rescue ship was the whaler &quot;Nassau&quot;.

Many crews were stranded on Kure Atoll after being shipwrecked on the surrounding reefs and had to survive on the local seals, turtles, and birds. The shipwrecks remain on the reef today, including the . Because of these incidents, King Kalākaua sent Colonel J. H. Boyd to Kure as his Special Commissioner. On September 20, 1886, he took possession of the island for the Hawaiian government. The King ordered that a crude house be built on the island, with tanks for holding water and provisions for any other unfortunates who might be cast away there. However, the provisions were stolen within a year and the house soon fell into ruins.

In 1867, the USS &quot;Lackawanna&quot; surveyed the atoll to produce more accurate charts of the reefs.

The USS &quot;Saginaw&quot; wrecked on the atoll in October 1870. The crew was able to abandon ship, but not much was saved. A crew of five sailed the captain&#x27;s gig to the island of Kauai, but only 1 survived the difficult month-long voyage. Despite this, word did get to the authorities, which sent a rescue ship to the stranded crew which was able to rescue them in January 1871.

The vessel &quot;Dunnottar Castle&quot; shipwrecked in 1886, and the crew was able to reach Kauai eventually; however, some lives were lost.

===20th century===
Largely neglected for most of its history, during World War II Kure was routinely visited by U.S. Navy patrols from nearby Midway to ensure that the Japanese were not using it to refuel submarines or flying boats from submarine-tankers for attacks elsewhere in the Hawaiian chain. During the Battle of Midway, a Japanese Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; bomber, operating from aircraft carrier &quot;Hiryū&quot;, piloted by Lieutenant Kikuchi Rokurō, and which had been involved in the initial Japanese attack on Midway&#x27;s US installations, crash-landed near Kure after being damaged by US fighters. Once ashore, Lt. Kikuchi and the two other members of his crew (Warrant Officer Yumoto Noriyoshi and Petty Officer (1st Class) Narasaki Hironori) refused capture and were either killed or committed suicide when an American landing party tried to capture them.
In the 1950s, there was a radar reflector on the island, and the island was also used for a scientific study of Pacific birds. In 1959 zig-zag stripes were cut through the groves of &quot;Scaevola&quot; bushes to make habitat space for albatrosses.

In 1960, construction began on a LORAN base and it was finished in 1961. Also in 1961, the tug &quot;Port of Bandon&quot; sank on the reef. The base included buildings for the LORAN station, a LORAN radio tower, and a airstrip.

Between 1963 and 1965, the Polynesian rat (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;) population was studied.

In 1966, a Boeing 707 jet airliner made an emergency landing at Kure Atoll.

Kure is located within a major current which washes up debris from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, such as fishing nets and large numbers of cigarette lighters, on the island. These pose threats to the local animals, especially birds, whose skeletons are frequently found with plastic in the stomach cavity.

On October 16, 1998, the longline fishing vessel &quot;Paradise Queen II&quot; ran aground on the eastern edge of Green Island of Kure Atoll, spilling approximately 4,000 gallons of diesel fuel before recovery operations could commence. Debris from that shipwreck continued to pollute the reef and shoreline for many years, endangering wildlife and damaging the coral reef. The long-term impact of this and other wrecks within the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) highlight the dangers to sensitive habitats in the area. To help ensure their protection, the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument was designated a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) in 2008 by the International Maritime Organization. In addition to avoiding specific areas, owners must identify when their ship enters and leaves the PSSA&#x27;s reporting area so a timely response can be taken should there be a maritime emergency.

From 1960 to 1992, a United States Coast Guard LORAN station was located on Green Island. A short coral runway was built on the island to support Coast Guard operations, but it was abandoned and is currently unusable. Although there is no permanent human population, the atoll is formally part of the City and County of Honolulu.
It became a state wildlife sanctuary in 1981.
Since 1993, the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources and volunteers from the Kure Atoll Conservancy group have helped to restore the atoll to a more natural state. Jean-Michel Cousteau produced a video on a voyage to Kure which first aired in 2006. Since 2010 the Division of Forestry and Wildlife has had a year-round presence on Kure Atoll.

===21st century===
In 2002, the wreck of a 19th-century whaling ship was found at Kure Atoll. This wreck was further explored in 2005, 2006, and 2008; it is thought it may be the wreck of the sailing ship &quot;Parker&quot;. The &quot;Parker&quot; was a whaling ship that wrecked on Kure Atoll in 1842. The crew was rescued after a few months.

The wreck of the USS &quot;Saginaw&quot; was found in 2003. The research dive studying the wreck was featured in the book &quot;A Civil War Gunboat in Pacific Waters: Life on Board USS Saginaw&quot;.

In 2008, the shipwreck of the vessel &quot;Gledstanes&quot; was found. The &quot;Gledstanes&quot; was a British whaling ship that wrecked in 1837.

In 2010, the wreck of a sailboat was recovered from Kure Atoll. The sailboat was discovered in 2007, and was determined to be the boat of a sailor who departed from Fiji in 2006, but was lost at sea.

In 2020, a crew of four stayed on the island from February through October. While there is no television or cell phone service, limited internet connectivity allows for emails to be sent and received. The island is occupied by two crews each year that are rotated in and out. Their job is to keep an eye on the island, and they also try to clean up trash that washes up on the island.

In the 2020s, removing ghost nets and marine debris from Kure and other northwest Hawaiian islands remains a big concern, which are known to endanger wildlife and pollute environment.

==Amateur radio==
Because of its particularly remote location, Kure Atoll has been the scene of several amateur radio DX expeditions, or DX-peditions. Because the radio propagation path between Kure and Europe runs right over the North Polar region, opportunities for distant communication with Kure are particularly popular among European amateurs.

The callsign prefix for Kure Atoll as of 2017 is KH7K, and for nearby Midway Atoll KH4, on the DXCC list. They were briefly deleted from the DXCC list and had to be re-added after a review, due to a legal change of the overall regions status.

Some of the DXpeditions to Kure were:
* 1969Callsign: KH6NR/KH6From November 11 to November 14, 1969, Marine Staff Sergeant Don Chilcote, KH6GKV (now VE6NN), and Navy ICFN Gene Lewis, KH6HDB (now W5LE), operated from Kure Island, using the U.S. Navy Reserve Training Center, Honolulu&#x27;s callsign.
* 1970 Callsign: W7UXP/KH6 - October by WB2OIF, KH6HCM/W7UXP, KH6HGP/W7WOX
* 1971–72Callsign: KH6EDY—The U.S. Coast Guard Kure Island LORAN station&#x27;s callsign.
* 1973–74Callsign: KH6HDBFrom September 1973 to September 1974, Gene Lewis, KH6HDB (now W5LE), operated from Kure Island. Lewis had been one of the two operators to activate Kure during the one-week DXpedition of KH6NR/KH6 during November 1969. He subsequently joined the Coast Guard for the express purpose of getting to spend a one-year tour of duty on Kure Island.
* 1997Event call sign: K7K. This was a joint scientific/radio operation including four fish and wildlife scientists and the eight members of the Midway-Kure DX Foundation&#x27;s 1996 Midway team. The team included four scientists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
* 2005Event call sign: K7C. The team consisted of 12 amateur radio operators from the United States, Canada, and Germany.
*2018 - the Pacific Island DX-pedition Group&#x27;s 4th application since 2014 was rejected by the Hawaii Dept. of Land and Natural Resources, citing the inability to provide &quot;adequate safeguards for the resources and ecological integrity&quot; of Kure Atoll, despite successful Amateur Radio activations, with U.S. Fish and Wildlife representation, on Palmyra, Navassa, and Baker Islands with no harmful impact to those island habitats.

Kure&#x27;s Green Island was home to a radio geolocation station from the early 1960s to 1992. Called LORAN (short for LOng RAnge Navigation), the base was operated by the U.S. Coast Guard and supported the LORAN-C system. This land-based electronic navigation aid helped ships and aircraft locate themselves on the Earth&#x27;s surface. This base was shut down because the LORAN system was superseded by the Global Positioning System (GPS), which uses satellites in Earth orbit rather than ground stations like at Kure Island. The LORAN station was commissioned on 18 March 1961 and was decommissioned on 2 July 1992.

Kure&#x27;s LORAN base had a radio tower that was later demolished when operations ended.

The ham radio call sign for the Kure LORAN Station was KH6EDY.

The site was surveyed in 1959 and construction began in 1960. The survey team was attacked by rats in the night. The base was staffed by about 20–30 or so personnel, and the base received many awards over its history including the Coast Guard Unit Commendation in 1986–1989.

==Airstrip==
The Kure airport had one 3800 ft. long runway, and is now closed. Its ICAO code was PM64.

Aircraft that routinely operated from the airstrip included U.S. Coast Guard HC-123B Provider and HC-130H aircraft and several types of U.S. Navy fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters from Midway. Flights routinely carried mail, cargo, and passengers to Kure Atoll since its completion in the 1960s.

The airstrip was also known to have been used for emergency landings, including a Lockheed Constellation (C-121) in 1961 and a Boeing 707 in 1966.

==Shipwrecks==
Kure Atoll is noted as the location of various shipwrecks:
Some of the noted wrecks at the atoll include:
*1837 &quot;Gledstanes&quot;
*1842 &quot;Parker&quot;
*1870 &quot;Saginaw&quot;
*1886 &quot;Dunnottar Castle&quot;
*1888 &quot;Ocean Pearl&quot;
*1937 &quot;Statu Maru&quot;
*1961 &quot;Port of Bandon&quot;
*1976 &quot;Houei Maru&quot;

The wreck of the whaling ship &quot;Gledstanes&quot; was found in 2008. Many of the crews survived by living on Kure until they could leave the island.

<text>George Louis Chuvalo (born September 12, 1937, as Jure Čuvalo) is a Canadian former professional boxer who was a five-time Canadian heavyweight champion and two-time world heavyweight title challenger. He is known for having never been knocked down in his 93 bout professional career including fights against Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, and George Foreman. Chuvalo unsuccessfully challenged Muhammad Ali for the heavyweight championship in 1966. Chuvalo was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Early life and career==
Chuvalo was born on September 12, 1937, to Croat immigrants Stipan and Katica from Ljubuški in the Herzegovina region of what is today Bosnia and Herzegovina. Chuvalo became the Canadian amateur heavyweight champion in May 1955, defeating Winnipeg&#x27;s Peter Piper with a first-round knockout (KO) in a tournament final in Regina, Saskatchewan. Chuvalo finished his amateur career with a 16–0 record, all by KO within four rounds. Originally nicknamed &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, Chuvalo turned professional in 1956, knocking out four opponents in one night to win a heavyweight tournament held by former world champion Jack Dempsey at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on April 26, 1956.

George Chuvalo&#x27;s rankings as a heavyweight were: number 9 in 1963, number 5 in 1964, number 3 in 1965, number 8 in 1966, number 4 in 1968 and number 7 in 1970.

===Against Ali===
Chuvalo is best known for his two fights against Muhammad Ali. He went the distance both times, in each case, losing the decision by a wide margin on the scorecards. The first fight, on March 29, 1967, at Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens, was for Ali&#x27;s world heavyweight title. &quot;He&#x27;s the toughest guy I ever fought&quot;, said Ali of Chuvalo after the fight.

=== Other notable contests ===
Chuvalo defeated many heavyweights who were top ten contenders, including Johnny Arthur, Julio Mederos, Howard King, Alex Miteff, James J. Parker, Yvon Durelle, Bob Cleroux, Willie Besmanoff, Mike DeJohn, Doug Jones, Bill Nielsen, Dante Cane, Joe Bygraves, Manuel Ramos, Jerry Quarry and Cleveland Williams. Some of his controversial losses on decision were to Bob Cleroux (twice), Floyd Patterson (&quot;Ring&quot; Magazine Fighter of the Year), Ernie Terrell and Oscar Bonavena. His two draws against Alex Miteff and Tony Alongi were also controversial. In his defeats, Chuvalo failed to go the distance only in 1967 with Joe Frazier, and in 1970 with George Foreman. In both cases the referee stopped the fight while Chuvalo was still on his feet. He was also disqualified in 1961 against Joe Erskine (for headbutting - after complaining repeatedly about being fouled). Chuvalo holds the distinction of never being knocked down in his 93 professional bouts.

==Tributes and other appearances==
Chuvalo also appeared in films, with acting roles in &quot;I Miss You, Hugs and Kisses&quot; (1978), &quot;Stone Cold Dead&quot; (1979), &quot;The Fly&quot; (1986), &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; (1987), &quot;Prom Night III: The Last Kiss&quot; (1989), &quot;The Return of Eliot Ness&quot; (1991), &quot;Lee&#x27;s Offering&quot; (2005) and &quot;Sicilian Vampire&quot; (2015).

His 1966 match against Ali was the subject of Joseph Blasioli&#x27;s 2003 documentary film &quot;The Last Round: Chuvalo vs. Ali&quot;.

On December 17, 2011, he travelled to Sarajevo to attend the unveiling of a statue in his honour in Ljubuški, his parents&#x27; birthplace, on December 18, 2011.

On May 11, 2019, the George Chuvalo Neighborhood Centre in Toronto, Ontario, opened which provides a variety of recreational programs for children as well as LGBTQ youth.

==Personal life==
When Chuvalo was 21, he married 15 year old Lynne, with whom he had five children. Three of Chuvalo&#x27;s sons, Jesse, Steven, and George Lee, were heroin addicts, which was introduced to the family by Jesse in 1984 after a severe motorbike accident led him to seek pain relief. The trio would often rob local pharmacies of prescription medication, for which they frequently served jail time. In February 1985, Jesse committed suicide, and over the next two months, Steven overdosed on heroin 15 times. In November 1993, less than a week after being released from prison for robbery, George Lee, who had survived a suicide attempt in prison and been threatening to intentionally overdose to reunite with Jesse, died of a heroin overdose. Four days after George&#x27;s death, Chuvalo&#x27;s grief-stricken wife Lynne committed suicide on November 4. In August 1996, despite recent attempts at improving his life, including nearing completion on a degree in Russian Literature from Queen&#x27;s University, Steven was found dead of a heroin overdose. Following his children&#x27;s deaths, Chuvalo went into a deep depression. By the time of Steven&#x27;s death, Chuvalo had also found himself in financial distress; the mortgage on his home had been foreclosed, and the contents of his house were being removed by creditors, although his economic situation improved over the following decades, due primarily to his giving speeches about his family&#x27;s travails. Chuvalo&#x27;s son Mitchell is a high school teacher, while daughter Vanessa manages a food market.

Three months after Lynne&#x27;s death, Chuvalo married his second wife, Joanne O&#x27;Hara, 20 years his junior, in January 1994. She already had two children from two previous relationships.

Chuvalo&#x27;s life, including the blows he had received in his boxing career, had taken a toll on his cognitive abilities. In 2018, a judge ruled that Chuvalo did not have the mental capacity to determine if he wished to reconcile with his wife after living apart for multiple years, and by 2022, he was suffering from advanced dementia.

In 1998, Chuvalo was appointed as a member of the Order of Canada and in 2005 received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. For his career success and anti-drug speaking campaigns, Chuvalo was awarded the key to the city of Toronto by mayor Rob Ford on March 26, 2013.

<text>Marc Ribot (;
born May 21, 1954) is an American guitarist and composer.

His work has touched on many styles, including no wave, free jazz, rock, and Cuban music. Ribot is also known for collaborating with other musicians, most notably Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, Vinicio Capossela and John Zorn.

==Biography==
Marc Ribot, who is of Jewish heritage, was born in Newark, New Jersey. He grew up in the Montrose section of South Orange, New Jersey. 

He has worked extensively as a session guitarist. He has performed and recorded with Tom Waits, Caetano Veloso, John Zorn, David Sylvian, Jack McDuff, Wilson Pickett, Arto Lindsay, T Bone Burnett, Medeski, Martin and Wood, Cibo Matto, Sam Phillips, Elvis Costello, Tift Merritt, Allen Ginsberg, Foetus, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, Susana Baca, The Black Keys, Vinicio Capossela, Alain Bashung, McCoy Tyner, Elton John, Madeleine Peyroux, Marianne Faithfull, Diana Krall, Mike Patton, Stormin’ Norman and Suzy Williams, Neko Case, Joe Henry, Allen Toussaint, Robert Quine, Ikue Mori, and others. Ribot was a member of The Lounge Lizards for several years in the late 1980s. Band leader John Lurie later wrote: &quot;Marc is a musical genius. So many ideas are coming out of that guy that it is actually often a problem.&quot;

Ribot&#x27;s earliest work as a session musician was featured on Tom Waits&#x27;s &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; (1985) and helped define Waits&#x27;s new musical direction. Ribot worked with Waits on many of his following albums including &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot; (1987), &quot;Big Time&quot; (1988), &quot;Mule Variations&quot; (1999), &quot;Real Gone&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot; (2006) and &quot;Bad as Me&quot; (2011). He has appeared on Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Spike&quot; (1989), &quot;Mighty Like a Rose&quot; (1991), and &quot;Kojak Variety&quot; (1995). Ribot has appeared on numerous recordings by John Zorn, including many of Zorn&#x27;s &quot;Filmworks&quot; recordings, solo performances on Zorn&#x27;s &quot;Masada Guitars&quot; (also featuring Bill Frisell and Tim Sparks), and is a member of Zorn&#x27;s Bar Kokhba Sextet and Electric Masada.

Ribot&#x27;s first two albums featured the Rootless Cosmopolitans, followed by an album of works by Frantz Casseus for solo guitar. Further releases found him working in a variety of band and solo contexts including two albums with his self-described &quot;dance band&quot;, Marc Ribot y Los Cubanos Postizos (Prosthetic Cubans), featuring compositions by Arsenio Rodríguez.

Ribot admitted to &quot;Guitar Player&quot; a relatively limited technical facility due to learning to play right-handed despite being left-handed: &quot;That&#x27;s a real limit, one that caused me a lot of grief when I was working with Jack McDuff and realising I wasn&#x27;t following in George Benson&#x27;s footsteps. I couldn&#x27;t be a straight-ahead jazz contender if you held a gun to my head.&quot;

He currently performs and records with his groups Marc Ribot&#x27;s Ceramic Dog with bassist Shahzad Ismaily and drummer Ches Smith of the avant-garde band Secret Chiefs 3, Marc Ribot Trio with bassist Henry Grimes and drummer Chad Taylor of Chicago Underground, Marc Ribot y Los Cubanos Postizos with Horacio “El Negro” Hernandez on drums and original members pianist Anthony Coleman, bassist Brad Jones and percussionist EJ Rodriquez, and The Young Philadelphians, covering 1970s Philadelphia soul music with Philadelphia-based musicians bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma and drummer G. Calvin Weston with guitarist Mary Halvorson plus a three-piece string section.

A biographical documentary film about Ribot was made, called &quot;The Lost String&quot;.

Ribot was also a judge for the sixth annual Independent Music Awards.

<text>Wreck Beach (Squamish: Ts&#x27;at&#x27;lhm) is a nude beach located in Pacific Spirit Regional Park, a part of Electoral Area A just west of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The clothing-optional section is clearly marked with signs and stretches about from Acadia Beach, in the north, to the Booming Grounds Creek on the north arm of the Fraser River. The main trail has approximately 400 steps. The park is administered by Metro Vancouver, though Indigenous claims are repeatedly asserted, especially by the Musqueam Nation. It is Canada&#x27;s only legally recognized nudist beach dating back to at least the 1930s. The Wreck Beach Preservation Society has provided advocacy to keep the beach undeveloped and recognized as a nudist beach with government. In 1993, a brutal murder and rape occurred at the top of the stairs and a plaque still remains in memory of Christina (Tina) Joy Thompson. Other murders have occurred more recently. 

== History ==
The earliest evidence of Indigenous peoples inhabitation dates back to 13,000 B.C. being the hunting, fishing, logging, spiritual connection grounds for the Musqueam, referred to as &quot;Ulksen&quot; or &quot;the nose&quot;. The beach is reclaimed from the sea in a joint venture with the Canadian Army and UBC to train cadets for beach landings in WWI, hence the presence of the &quot;instrument towers&quot;. In the Great Depression, nude bathing became popular due to high costs of swimsuits with men congregating on Siwash Rock in Stanley Park, to escape the puritanicalist oppression of local residents, a legacy of the Victorian era, they then flocked to Wreck Beach. The beach increased in popularity with hippies until the late 1960s when a police raid in 1970 yielded a dozen arrests. The Georgia Straight staged a nude-in protest with 3,000 showing up and the charges were dropped, with the police designating the area as a &quot;no-harm, no-foul zone&quot; until 1991 when it was officially designated a legally recognised nudist beach. On January 25, 1977, the &quot;Citizens Concerned for Coward&#x27;s Cove&quot; was formally established, then changed to &quot;Wreck Beach Committee&quot;, then to the &quot;Wreck Beach Preservation Society&quot; in 1983. The &quot;WBPS&quot; has fought against these developments: a 20-million cubic meter dredging operation behind the North Arm breakwater; a parallel trail from Trail 6 to Trail 7 (One already built there quietly by two unknowns); a proposal to barge millions of gallons of &quot;jet-fuel A&quot; past Wreck Beach weekly; toe-to-cliff-top condominiums (proposed in 2004); a 20-foot high, 10-foot wide sea wall over the beach it would supposedly have been meant to protect; viewing platforms which would have changed the interpretation of the Canadian &quot;Criminal Code&quot; insofar as nudity was concerned; the cutting of 40-acres of cliff face forest and then, the shaving of the cliffs in those 40-acres, and the construction of an RCMP service road to and along the beach. Current threats to the beach area include a restaurant overlooking the beach, the elimination of all curb-side parking, the grassing in of Marine Drive, and possible washrooms on the beach level instead of above and out of sight of the beach. In 2012, permanent toilet outhouses were installed.

== Acadia Beach – Tower Beach – Point Grey ==

The shoreline throughout these beaches is mainly rocky with some sandy stretches with fewer beach-goers. An area is provided for owners to have their dogs off leash. During the smelt season, naturists share this area with nude fishers and their families. Smelt fishing is typically prohibited from the middle of June to the middle of August.

Acadia Beach is short walk down a gentle slope from the parking lot on Marine Drive where there is a grassy area with several picnic tables. Tower Beach is at the end of the much longer Trail 3 and Point Grey is near the steeper Trail 4. There is pay parking close to Trail 3 and 4 at the Museum of Anthropology. All of Wreck Beach is contiguous and it is possible to walk along the entire coastline. However, when the tide is too high, access can be limited.

Along Tower Beach are two tall concrete range/direction instrument towers that are relics from World War II.

Along with lush vegetation, various forms of wildlife can also be seen, including nesting herons, sea lions, kingfishers, and bald eagles.

== Wreck Beach proper and Trail 6 ==
While the entire 7 km beach around to Point Grey from Acadia Beach to Booming Ground Creek is often referred to as Wreck Beach, the large sandy area on the north side of the North Arm Breakwater at the base of Trail 6 is what many think of when they talk about Wreck Beach. The trail is the most developed of the trails down the bluff and has 490 wooden steps set into the soil. At the bottom of Trail 6 is the most popular portion of the beach, a stretch of sand between two artificial rock jetties constructed as breakwaters, lined by a row of licensed vendors selling imported clothing, jewelry, drinks, snacks, and other beach related items. Other unlicensed vendors may be found wandering the beach selling alcoholic beverages.

Clothing is optional throughout Wreck Beach. Due to Wreck Beach&#x27;s proximity to the University of British Columbia, many students and some faculty and staff visit the beach. In recent years many beach users have objected, on both privacy and environmental grounds, to the university&#x27;s plans to construct new buildings close to the cliff edge and partially overlooking the beach.
== Swimming and ocean water quality ==

Swimming is popular at Wreck Beach, primarily as brief &quot;dips&quot; for beachgoers to cool off. Since the ocean water is quite cold, swimming far from shore without a wetsuit and partner is not advised. Ocean waves in the summer, when present, are quite small and usually do not pose a risk to swimmers or waders. Rip currents are not known to be a problem and advisories are not usually posted. Caution should be taken when diving or jumping into the water to avoid any submerged rocks. Adverse interactions with marine wildlife or flora are unlikely, but jellyfish should be avoided as a precautionary measure. Small pleasure boats may anchor close to the beach and swimmers should avoid potential collisions with them.

A few times over the years, Metro Vancouver health authorities have issued advisories that the ocean&#x27;s coliform bacteria counts near the beach are relatively high, and there may be potential risk to swimmers. However, Wreck Beach tends to have lower counts than many Vancouver beaches and gastrointestinal illness is generally unlikely.

<doc id="290112" wikidata="Q285502" url="?curid=290112" title="ISync">
<text>iSync is a defunct application developed by Apple Inc., which syncs iCal and Address Book data to SyncML-enabled mobile phones, via Bluetooth or by using a USB connection. It was first released on Jan 2, 2003, with technology licensed from fusionOne. Support for many (pre-October 2007) devices was built-in, with newer devices being supported via manufacturer and third-party iSync Plugins.

== History ==
iSync&#x27;s first beta was released on September 28, 2002.

In June 2003, &quot;The Register&quot; reported that an iSync 1.1 bug could lead to contacts without phone numbers being deleted from synced phones. iSync uses port 3004, which could also be blocked if the Mac OS X firewall was enabled.

Before the release of Mac OS X 10.4, iSync also synchronized a user&#x27;s Safari bookmarks with the now-defunct .Mac subscription service provided by Apple.

Starting with Mac OS X 10.4, much of iSync&#x27;s original syncing functionality was moved into the Sync Services framework, which developers can use to incorporate synchronization into their own applications. iSync, however, retained responsibility for the setup, configuration and synchronising of supported mobile handsets. Since the release of iTunes 4.8, the user interface for synchronizing iPods had been delegated to iTunes, although conflict-resolution and substantial changes to contact information (&gt;5%) show an iSync panel. Synchronization with MobileMe (previously .Mac) was then the domain of MobileMe Sync, accessible through a System Preferences pane.

iSync was removed from Mac OS X in version 10.7 (Lion). However, since the underlying framework still existed in Lion and 10.8 (Mountain Lion), it was possible to restore the functionality of iSync using a 10.6 (Snow Leopard) installation or backup.

== Device compatibility ==
In 2005, iSync supported iPods, personal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, and other devices; iSync supported phones from Motorola, Nokia, Panasonic, Sony Ericsson, Siemens, and Sendo.

Before the release of iSync, Palm had released its own sync software, Palm Desktop for Mac, which it soon abandoned. Apple created its own software tool, called Palm Conduit, to make iSync compatible with Palm&#x27;s HotSync protocol. iSync 2.0 directly integrated Palm Conduit. After the 2009 Palm Pre abandoned HotSync, Apple dropped Palm support from iSync 3.1 in Mac OS X Snow Leopard.

BlackBerry OS, Palm OS, and Windows Mobile (Pocket PC) devices were not officially supported by iSync, but could still be synchronized through the use of third-party iSync plug-ins.

<text>Booker Taliaferro Jones Jr. (born November 12, 1944) is an American musician, songwriter, record producer and arranger, best known as the frontman of the band Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s. He has also worked in the studios with many well-known artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, earning him a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement.

== Biography ==

Booker T. Jones was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on November 12, 1944. He was named after his father, Booker T. Jones Sr., who was named in honor of Booker T. Washington, the educator. Booker T. Jones Sr. was a science teacher at Memphis High School, providing the family with a relatively stable, lower middle-class lifestyle.

Jones was musically a child prodigy, playing the oboe, saxophone, trombone, double bass, and piano at school and organ at church. Jones attended Booker T. Washington High School, the alma mater of Rufus Thomas, and collaborated with future stars like Isaac Hayes&#x27;s writing partner David Porter, saxophonist Andrew Love of the Memphis Horns, soul singer/songwriter William Bell, and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&#x27;s singer/songwriter Maurice White. 

Jones&#x27;s entry into professional music came at the age of 16, when he played baritone saxophone on Satellite (soon to be Stax) Records&#x27; first hit, &quot;Cause I Love You&quot;, by Carla and Rufus Thomas. Willie Mitchell hired Jones for his band, in which Jones started on sax and later moved to bass. It was here that he met Al Jackson Jr., whom he brought to Stax. Simultaneously, Jones formed a combo with Maurice White and David Porter, in which he played guitar.

While hanging around the Satellite Record Shop run by Estelle Axton, co-owner of Satellite Records with her brother Jim Stewart, Jones met record clerk Steve Cropper, who would become one of the MGs when the group formed in 1962. Besides Jones on organ and Cropper on guitar, Booker T. and the MGs featured Lewie Steinberg on bass guitar and Al Jackson Jr. on drums (Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn eventually replacing Steinberg on bass). While still in high school, Jones co-wrote the group&#x27;s classic instrumental &quot;Green Onions&quot;, which was a massive hit in 1962.

Bob Altshuler wrote the sleeve notes on the first Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s album &quot;Green Onions&quot; released by Stax Records in 1962:
:[His] musical talents became apparent at a very early age. By the time he entered high school, Booker was already a semi-professional, and quickly recognized as the most talented musician in his school. He was appointed director of the school band for four years, and in addition, organized the school dance orchestra which played for proms throughout the Mid-South. In the classroom, he concentrated on the studies of music theory and harmony. ... Booker&#x27;s multiple activities earned him a coveted honour, that of being listed in the students&#x27; &quot;Who&#x27;s Who of American High Schools.&quot; Booker&#x27;s first instrument was the string bass, but he soon switched to the organ. Booker came to the attention of record executive Jim Stewart in Memphis, and while still in high school he worked as a staff musician for Stax Records, appearing as sideman on many recording dates for that label. It became obvious that one day Booker would be ready to record under his own name and several months later Booker&#x27;s first recording session was set.

Over the next few years, Jones divided his time between studying classical music composition, composing and transposition at Indiana University, playing with the MGs on the weekends back in Memphis, serving as a session musician with other Stax acts, and writing songs that became widely regarded as classics. He wrote, with Eddie Floyd, &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Found a Girl (To Love Me Like You Do)&quot;, Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;I Love You More Than Words Can Say&quot;, and, with William Bell, bluesman Albert King&#x27;s &quot;Born Under a Bad Sign&quot; (later popularized by the British rock group Cream).

In 1970, Jones moved to California and stopped playing sessions for Stax after becoming frustrated with Stax&#x27;s treatment of the MGs as employees rather than musicians. Even though Jones was given the title of Vice President at Stax before leaving, as he put it, &quot;There were titles given (to us) but we didn&#x27;t actually make the decisions.&quot; While still under contract to Stax, he appeared on Stephen Stills&#x27;s eponymous album (1970). The 1971 album &quot;Melting Pot&quot; would be the last Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s album issued on Stax.

Jones was married to Priscilla Coolidge in 1969, sister of singer Rita Coolidge. He produced Priscilla&#x27;s first album &quot;Gypsy Queen&quot; in 1970; then the pair collaborated as a duo on three albums: 1971&#x27;s &quot;Booker T. &amp; Priscilla&quot;, 1972&#x27;s &quot;Home Grown&quot;, and 1973&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles&quot;, and Jones produced Priscilla&#x27;s final solo album, &quot;Flying&quot;, in 1979, right as their marriage ended that year.
Making the charts as a solo artist in 1981 with &quot;I Want You&quot;, he produced Bill Withers&#x27;s 1971 debut album &quot;Just as I Am&quot; (on which Jones played guitar as well as keyboards), Rita Coolidge&#x27;s album &quot;Love Me Again&quot; (1978) and Willie Nelson&#x27;s album &quot;Stardust&quot; (1978). Jones has also added his keyboard playing to artists ranging from the R&amp;B/pop/blues of Ray Charles to the folk rock/country rock of Neil Young.

On June 18, 1985, Jones married Nanine Warhurst. They have three children together, and an additional five stepchildren from their prior relationships. One of their daughters, Olivia Jones, is also a performer, and starred in &quot;Candy Girls&quot;.

On March 1, 1995, Booker T. &amp; the MGs won their first Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for the song &quot;Cruisin&#x27;&quot;. Jones still plays with the MGs and his own small combo called the Booker T. Jones Band. His current touring group includes Vernon &quot;Ice&quot; Black (guitar), Darian Gray (drums), and Melvin Brannon (bass).

Jones was inducted into The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992, and was honored with a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement on February 11, 2007.

In 2007, Jones was also inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee.

In 2009 he released a new solo album, &quot;Potato Hole&quot;, recorded with the Drive-By Truckers, and featuring Neil Young. He performed at the Bonnaroo Music Festival with Drive-By Truckers on June 6, 2009, with a set including most tracks from &quot;Potato Hole&quot; as well as some Truckers tracks. On January 31, 2010, &quot;Potato Hole&quot; won the Best Instrumental Album award at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards.

He is featured on the Rancid album &quot;Let the Dominoes Fall&quot; (2009), playing a Hammond B-3 on the track &quot;Up to No Good&quot;.

Jones also played his B-3 on the track &quot;If It Wasn&#x27;t For Bad&quot; from the Elton John and Leon Russell 2010 collaboration album titled &quot;The Union&quot;. The track was nominated at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. 

In 2011, Jones released &quot;The Road from Memphis&quot;. The backing band included Questlove (drums), &quot;Captain&quot; Kirk Douglas (guitar) and Owen Biddle (bass) from the Roots as well as former Motown guitarist Dennis Coffey and percussionist Stewart Killen. The album features vocals by Yim Yames, Matt Berninger, Lou Reed, Sharon Jones and Booker T. himself, as well as lyrics contributed by his daughter/manager Liv Jones. Jones also recorded with party band the Gypsy Queens on their eponymous album.

On February 12, 2012, &quot;The Road from Memphis&quot; won at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Pop Instrumental Album. Jones holds a total of four Grammy Awards.

Jones received an honorary doctorate degree from Indiana University&#x27;s Jacobs School of Music at its 2012 undergraduate commencement. Jones originally attended Indiana University in the 1960s, even staying after his smash-hit Stax Records recordings.

Jones was featured on organ for singer Kelly Hogan on Hogan&#x27;s 2013 release on Anti-Records, &quot;I Like to Keep Myself in Pain&quot;.

In June 2013, Jones released his 10th album, &quot;Sound The Alarm&quot;, on Stax Records after originally leaving the label more than 40 years previously in 1971. The album features guest artists Anthony Hamilton, Raphael Saadiq, Jay James, Mayer Hawthorne, Estelle, Vintage Trouble, Gary Clark Jr., Luke James, and Booker&#x27;s son Ted Jones. That summer, he performed at the TD Kitchener Blues Festival in Ontario.

On September 1, 2017, Jones performed live at the Royal Albert Hall BBC Proms with Jools Holland and his Rhythm &amp; Blues Orchestra in a tribute concert honoring the 50th anniversary of Stax Records alongside Steve Cropper, Sam Moore, William Bell and British artists Beverley Knight, Ruby Turner, James Morrison and Tom Jones.

On October 29, 2019, his memoir &quot;Time Is Tight: My Life, Note by Note&quot; was released. The memoir was mentioned on &quot;Fresh Air&quot; on October 25, 2019.

<doc id="290122" wikidata="Q1574130" url="?curid=290122" title="Han (Warring States)">
<text>Han was an ancient Chinese state during the Warring States period. Scholars frequently render the name as Hann to clearly distinguish it from China&#x27;s later Han dynasty. It was located in central China (modern-day Shanxi and Henan) in a region south and east of Luoyang, the capital of the Eastern Zhou. It was ruled by aristocrats of the Ji (姬) family ancestral temple who rose to power as a ministerial family in the state of Jin, and whose power eventually eclipsed that of the Jin ruling house. The partition of Jin which resulted in the states of Han, Wei, and Zhao, marked the beginning of the Warring States period.

The state of Han was small and located in a mountainous and unprofitable region. Its territory directly blocked the passage of the state of Qin into the North China Plain.. Although Han had attempted to reform its governance (notably under Chancellor Shen Buhai who improved state administration and strengthened its military ability) these reforms were not enough to defend itself and it was the first of the seven warring states to be conquered by Qin in 230 BC.

A Qin invasion of Han&#x27;s Shangdang Commandery in 260 BC resulted in the Battle of Changping, claimed to be the bloodiest battle of the Warring States period where up to 400,000 soldiers died.

==History==
===Founding===
According to chapter 45 of the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, the royal family of Han was a cadet branch of the royal family of the state of Jin. The founder of the Han clan Wuzi of Han was the uncle of Duke Wu of Jin.

Members of the family became ministers in the powerful state of Jin and were granted Hanyuan (modern Hancheng in Shaanxi).

===Spring and Autumn period===
During the Spring and Autumn period, members of the Han family slowly gained more and more influence and power within Jin. In 453 BC, Jing of Han, along with Wen of Wei and Lie of Zhao partitioned Jin among themselves. In Chinese history, this Partition of Jin is the event which marks the end of the Spring and Autumn period and the beginning of the Warring States. Subsequently, Han was an independent polity. King Weilie eventually recognized the new states in 403 BC and elevated the rulers to (&quot;hou&quot;, &quot;marquess&quot;).

===Warring States Period===
In 375 Han defeated the neighboring state of Zheng (founded in 806 by the Zhou dynasty). Han conquered and annexed Zheng, thus expanding its territory. Han also moved its capital there, and assimilated Zheng&#x27;s heritage. This included that of the young politician Shen Buhai (400-337).

Han&#x27;s highest point occurred under the rule of Marquess Xi. Xi appointed Shen Buhai as his chancellor and implemented his Legalist policies. These reforms improved state administration and strengthened its military capability. Under King Xuanhui ( 332–312 BC), Han declared itself an independent kingdom.

However, Han was disadvantaged in the competition of the Warring States period because Jin&#x27;s partition had left it surrounded on all sides by strong states: Chu to the south, Qi to the east, Qin to the west, and Wei to the north. Han was then the smallest of the seven states and was without any easy way to further expand its own territory and resources, It was bullied militarily by its more powerful neighbors.

===Defeat===
During its steady decline, Han eventually lost the power to defend its territory and had to request military assistance from other states. The contest between Wei and Qi over control of Han resulted in the Battle of Maling, which established Qi as the pre-eminent state in the east. In 260 BC, Qin&#x27;s invasion of Han led to Zhao intervention and the Battle of Changping.

During the late years of the era, in an attempt to drain Qin&#x27;s resources in an expensive public works project, the state of Han sent the civil engineer Zheng Guo to Qin to persuade them to build a canal. The scheme, while expensive, backfired spectacularly when it was eventually completed: the irrigation abilities of the new Zhengguo Canal far outweighed its cost and gave Qin the agricultural and economic means to dominate the other six states. Han was the first to fall, in 230 BC.

In 226 BC, former nobility of the Han launched a failed rebellion in former capital Xinzheng, and King An, the last king of Han, was put to death the same year.

Han Xin was made a &quot;Prince&quot; or &quot;King of Han&quot; () by Liu Bang after the establishment of the Han dynasty (). He was removed to Taiyuan Commandery and the territory of the kingdom of Dai, where he defected to the Xiongnu and led raids against the Han Dynasty until his death.

==Culture and society==
Before the state of Qin unified China in 221 BC, each region had their own unique customs and culture, although they were all dominated by an upper class that shared a largely common culture. In the &quot;Yu Gong&quot; (Tribute of Yu), a section of the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; which was most likely composed in the 4th century BC, the author describes a China that is divided into nine regions, each with its own distinctive peoples and products. The core theme of this section is that these nine regions are unified into one state by the travels of the eponymous sage-emperor, Yu the Great, and by sending each region&#x27;s unique goods to the capital as tribute. Other texts also discussed these regional variations in culture and physical environments.

One of these texts was &quot;Wuzi&quot; (&quot;The Book of Master Wu&quot;) which was a Warring States military treatise written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the other states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were linked to the physical environment and territory they live in.

==In the Han Feizi==
Chapter 19 of the Han Feizi recalls Qin&#x27;s conquest of Ye from the Zhao, dated to 236bc. The chapter says: &quot;To-day, Han, being a small state, is relying upon big powers. Her sovereign, paying little attention to the law, takes every word from Qin. The above-mentioned small states, having relied upon Wey, Ch`i, Ching, and Wu for support, went to ruin one after another. Thus reliance on others is not sufficient to extend the native soil.&quot; Seemingly written from the context of the late Han state, the chapter might have preceded its fall in 230bc, or either Zhao and Wei if the latter had only yet ceded territory.

<text>Adventure Island II is a side-scrolling platform game developed by Now Production and published by Hudson Soft that was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. It is the sequel to &quot;Adventure Island&quot; and the second game in the series for the NES. While the first game was an adaptation of Sega&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; arcade game, &quot;Adventure Island II&quot; is an original work, as were most of the subsequent &quot;Adventure Island&quot; games. A portable version was also released for the Game Boy in 1992 titled Takahashi Meijin no Bouken Jima II or Adventure Island outside of Japan.

==Plot==
Master Higgins&#x27; girlfriend Tina, has just been kidnapped by the Evil Witch Doctor&#x27;s persistent followers. Eight perilous islands are in control of the various monster minions, although four friendly dinosaurs will gladly ally themselves with those willing to brave the islands&#x27; dangers and defeat their common oppressors. Thinking of how grateful his favorite lady will be when he comes to her rescue, Master Higgins embarks on a daunting quest to get to his honey.

==Gameplay==

The rules of the game are the same as those in the original &quot;Adventure Island&quot;, with the main new feature being the addition of an inventory system. Before the player begins a stage, he can choose which of Higgins&#x27; animal friends to bring (if he has rescued any), as well as whether or not he should bring one of the stone hammers he has accumulated. Because of this, the player can no longer upgrade to shooting fireballs when he picks a second hammer. Instead, it gets added as a reserved hammer to the player&#x27;s inventory.

The checkpoint system has been eliminated and if the player dies in the middle of a stage, he must restart from the very beginning. However, the stages are significantly shorter than in the previous game. When the player strikes a place where a hidden egg is located, it will play a different noise that will serve as an indicator of its location. The bonus zones are now accessed by picking up a key located inside these hidden eggs. Some of these keys will also transport the player to an item room or a shortcut to the next island. There are now underwater stages, as well as vertical-scrolling stages. When the player completes a stage riding a skateboard, he does not get to take it to the next stage like he could in the previous game. When the player completes a stage, he will be asked to choose one of ten spinning eggs that will give him a certain number of points. The player can now backtrack during a stage as well, but only up to a certain point.

The boss of each island awaits the player on a specific stage at the beginning. However, if the player is defeated while fighting a boss, the boss will move to another area, forcing the player not only to clear his current stage, but also another one in order to fight the boss.

There are four types of dinosaur friends that Higgins can ride. These animal friends are summoned when the player collects a playing card suit hidden inside an egg, and they include: A blue camptosaurus (summoned by a heart card) that attacks with its tail and can walk on ice without sliding; a red camptosaurus (spade) that can breathe fire and swim over lava until a certain point; a pteranodon (clover) that can fly over obstacles and drop stones; and an elasmosaurus (diamond), the only dinosaur that can survive in underwater stages (the others will be lost when used underwater) and can help Higgins swim faster.

==Reception==
Allgame editor Skyler Miller praised the game over the original, specifically its &quot;improved graphics, a map screen, and most importantly, four dinosaur buddies for Master Higgins to ride, each with their own special ability&quot;.

==Other media==
&quot;Adventure Island II&quot; is one of the video games featuring in the manga titled &quot;Cyber Boy&quot;, by Nagai Noriaki, Published by Coro Coro Comic and Shogakukan, from 1991 to 1993. Cover artwork for the packaging was illustrated by Shelley L. Hunter.

<doc id="290133" wikidata="Q549567" url="?curid=290133" title="Dangun">
<text>Dangun or Tangun (; ), also known as Dangun Wanggeom (; ), was the legendary founder and first king of Gojoseon, the first Korean kingdom. He founded the first kingdom around the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. He is said to be the &quot;grandson of heaven&quot;, &quot;son of a bear&quot;, and to have founded the first kingdom in 2333 BC.

The earliest recorded version of the Dangun legend appears in the 13th-century &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, which purportedly cites Korea&#x27;s lost historical record, &quot;Gogi&quot; (; &#x27;Ancient Record&#x27;) and China&#x27;s &quot;Book of Wei&quot;. However, there is no records related to Dangun in the current surviving version of the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;.

Koreans celebrate Dangun&#x27;s founding of Gojoseon, Korea&#x27;s first dynasty, on 3 October as a national holiday known as National Foundation Day (&quot;Gaecheonjeol&quot;). It is a religious anniversary started by Daejongism (), worshipping Dangun.

Many Korean historians regard Dangun and Tengri as being etymologically identical.

== Myth and interpretations ==

In Korean mythology, Dangun&#x27;s ancestry legend begins with his grandfather Hwanin (), the &quot;Lord of Heaven&quot;. Hwanin had a son, Hwanung, who yearned to live on the earth among the valleys and the mountains. Hwanin permitted Hwanung and 3,000 followers to descend onto Taebaeksan (written as Myohyang-san in &quot;samguk sagi&quot;, but now believed to be Paektu Mountain), where Hwanung founded Sinsi (, &quot;City of God&quot;). Along with his ministers of clouds, rain and wind, he instituted laws and moral codes and taught humans various arts, medicine, and agriculture. Legend attributes the development of acupuncture and moxibustion to Dangun.

A tiger and a bear prayed to Hwanung that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them twenty cloves of garlic and a bundle of mugwort, ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.

The bear-woman, Ungnyeo, was grateful and made offerings to Hwanung. However, she lacked a husband, and soon became sad and prayed beneath a &quot;divine birch&quot; tree () to be blessed with a child. Hwanung, moved by her prayers, took her for his wife and soon she gave birth to a son named Dangun Wanggeom.

Dangun ascended to the throne, built the walled city of Asadal situated near Pyongyang (the location is disputed), and called the kingdom Joseon—referred to today as Gojoseon so as not to be confused with the later kingdom of Joseon that was established roughly 2000 years later. He then moved his capital to Asadal on Mount Paegak or Mount Gunghol.

Dangun&#x27;s biography reflected the interest of the people of Dangun Joseon (Gojoseon) at the time in establishing the legitimacy of the kingship of Gojoseon and the dignity of the country. The king of Gojoseon conducted a ritual in honor of his ancestral god every year. Soon, the myth of Dangun was the political ideology of the Gojoseon period, and the ritual had a function of political assembly.

=== Dating ===
Emperor Dangun&#x27;s rule is usually calculated to begin in 2333 BCE, based on the description of the &quot;Tongguk t&#x27;onggam&quot; (1485) contrary to the 40th year of the reign of the legendary Chinese Emperor Yao. Other sources vary somewhat, but also put it during Yao&#x27;s reign (traditional dates: 2357 BC-2256 BC). The &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; states Dangun ascended to the throne in the 50th year of Yao&#x27;s reign, while &quot;Annals of the Joseon Dynasty&quot; says the first year and &quot;Tongguk t&#x27;onggam&quot; says the 25th year.
Until 1961, the official South Korean era (for numbering years) was called the &quot;Dangi&quot; (), which began in 2333 BC. Followers of Daejongism considered 3 October in the Korean calendar as &quot;Gaecheonjeol&quot;. This day is now a public holiday in South Korea in the Gregorian calendar called &quot;National Foundation Day&quot;. North Korea dates Dangun&#x27;s founding of Gojoseon to the early 30th century BC.

15 March in the year 4340 of the Dangun Era is called &quot;Royal Day Festival&quot; (), the day that the semi-legendary founder Dangun returned to the heavens.

=== Historical perception ===

Dangun began to attract attention during the late Goryeo dynasty, when Koreans fought wars against the Mongolian Yuan dynasty. During the Joseon period they were worshiped as the ancestors of the nation. In the Joseon dynasty, a shrine dedicated to Dangun of Gojoseon and King Chumo of Goguryeo was built in Pyongyang, and the Samseongdang (), dedicated to the gods of Hwanin, Hwanung, and Dangun, was built.

In Korea at the end of the 19th century, it was greatly emphasized to highlight the resistance of the Joseon people against Imperialist invasion, and it developed into a religion, Dangunkyo (). Dangun, who emerged as the central figure of nationalism, played a large role in the spiritual foundation of the independence movement during the Japanese colonial period. In addition, the history of the Dangun era was compiled by followers of Daejongism, such as &#x27;Daedong Sagang&#x27; () and &#x27;Gyuwon Sahwa&#x27; () and the independence movement, emphasizing the history of the Dangun period.

The study of Dangun in South Korea focused on the historical significance of the Gojoseon society. In South Korea, Dangun Wanggeom is regarded as the head of the Gojoseon society, with many characteristics of the role of high priest. Wanggeom has the meaning of an overlord who governs the country.

In North Korea, the Dangun and Dangun myths were previously established as the founding myth to justify the process of establishing the Gojoseon regime. However, after the excavation of the Mausoleum of Tangun in 1994, North Korea changed its position and claimed that the Dangun myth reflects historical facts and that Dangun is a real person. Also, Dangun claims that the first king of Gojoseon, founded by the Korean people, had all of his birth, founding, and tombs in Pyongyang. There is a tomb of Dangun that North Korea excavated and reconstructed near the city directly under Pyongyang.

== Appearances ==
The earliest recorded version of the Dangun legend appears in the 13th century &quot;Samguk yusa&quot;, which cites China&#x27;s Book of Wei and Korea&#x27;s lost history text &quot;Gogi&quot; (). This is the best known and most studied version, but similar versions are recorded in the &quot;Jewang Un-gi&quot; by the late Goryeo scholar Yi Seunghyu (, 1224–1300), as well as the &quot;Eungje Siju&quot; () and &quot;Sejong Sillok&quot; (; commonly known as &quot;Annals of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Sejong Jang-heon Dae-wang Shil-lok&quot;; ) of the early Joseon. Dangun is worshipped today as a deity by the followers of Cheondoism and Daejongism.

===In taekwondo===
Dangun is the second pattern or hyeong in the International Taekwon-Do Federation form of the Korean martial art taekwondo. Students learn that the hyeong represents &quot;the holy legendary founder of Korea in the year 2333 BC.&quot;

== Mausoleum of Dangun ==
North Korea&#x27;s leader Kim Il Sung insisted that Dangun was not merely a legend but a real historical person. As a consequence, North Korean archaeologists were compelled to locate the purported remains and grave of Dangun.

According to a North Korean publication, the Mausoleum of Dangun is the alleged burial site of the legendary Dangun.

<text>Heroes Unlimited is a superhero role-playing game written by Kevin Siembieda and first published by Palladium Books in 1984. The game is based upon the Palladium Books Megaversal system and is compatible with other games that use the Palladium system.

==Description==
&quot;Heroes Unlimited&quot; features superheroes fighting supervillains in a comic book-like world. The game&#x27;s introduction states that the game was designed to be a &quot;thinking man&#x27;s&quot; superhero role-playing game where the characters were vulnerable and could not amass an incredible number of skills or abilities. The experience point-system of the game allowed users to defeat one&#x27;s enemies with heroic sacrifice. Characters in the game are defined by &quot;the eight attributes&quot;, skills (dependent on education level), and class, which allows the selection of certain powers or enhanced skills or equipment. The classes include super-powered beings to aliens to technology-based or special-training-based characters. Some classes and super-powers (such as the ancient master class or invulnerability powers) start powerful but do not mature, while other classes and powers have effects strongly tied to character level.

The second edition of the game added updates to the previous supplements, in addition to the new play options, along with several new supplements produced by Palladium Books. This edition added new powers and minor rule changes which allowed users to expand play options by adding superpowers to classes, the introduction of the &quot;crazy&quot; heroes option, and added magic-powered characters to the game at the request of the players. The revised edition also included a short rules summary of the Palladium game &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness&quot;, adding mutant animal character rules and a shortened selection of animals for character creation. The mutant animal characters are generally weaker than standard heroes as the TMNT supplement &quot;Turtles Go Hollywood&quot; noted.

==Publication history==
&quot;Heroes Unlimited&quot; was first published by Palladium Books in 1984 and revised in 1987. A second edition was published in 1998.

==Reception==
William A. Barton reviewed &quot;Heroes Unlimited&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer&quot; No. 72. Barton commented that &quot;if you desire hero-types like Batman, Captain America, Robotman, or Wolverine, &quot;Heroes Unlimited&quot; is a superbuy, even if you use it as nothing more than a sourcebook for an existing game&quot;.

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan thought this game had &quot;an appealing, versatile system, though it&#x27;s also unfocused and a little bland.&quot; Swan noted that mutant and alien heroes had a large advantage over heroes from Earth, and commented, &quot;it makes for an unbalanced role-playing game.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a rating of 2.5 out of 4, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s an excellent source of ideas, however, especially the sections on robotics and equipment, and makes a nice supplement for any of the other superhero games.&quot; 

In a 1996 readers&#x27; poll by British games magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, &quot;Heroes Unlimited&quot; was ranked 40th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;Superhero roleplaying for the &quot;Palladium&quot; player, but not all that easy to pick up&quot;.

<doc id="290144" wikidata="Q455219" url="?curid=290144" title="Amarone">
<text>Amarone della Valpolicella, usually known as Amarone (, ), is an Italian DOCG denomination of typically rich dry red wine made from the partially dried grapes of the Corvina (45–95%, of which up to 50% could be substituted with Corvinone), Rondinella (5–30%) and other approved red grape varieties (up to 25%). 

Valpolicella is in the province of Verona, within the large Veneto region.

In Italian, the name &quot;Amarone&quot; literally means &#x27;Great Bitter&#x27;; originally, this was to distinguish it from the Recioto produced in the same region, which is sweeter in taste.

==History==
Notable wines have been produced in Valpolicella since ancient times, but the Verona wine was not marketed as Amarone before 1953. It is believed that the label Amarone was coined by Adelino Lucchese in 1936.

The wine was assigned &quot;denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) status in December 1990. On 4 December 2009, Amarone and Recioto della Valpolicella were promoted to the status of &quot;denominazione di origine controllata e garantita&quot; (DOCG). Total production for sale (including Recioto) in 2008 was 8.57 million bottles.

==Process==
Grapes are harvested ripe in the first two weeks of October, by carefully choosing bunches having fruits not too close to each other, to let the air flow. Grapes are allowed to dry, traditionally on bamboo racks (&#x27; in local dialect) but more commonly in plastic or wooden crates. This process is called &#x27; or &quot;&quot; (to dry and shrivel) in Italian. This concentrates the remaining sugars and flavours thanks to the water evaporation and is similar to the production of French Vin de Paille. The pomace left over from pressing off the Amarone is used in the production of &quot;ripasso&quot; Valpolicellas.

Modern Amarone is produced in special drying chambers under controlled conditions. This approach minimizes the amount of handling of the grapes and helps prevent the onset of &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;. In Amarone, the quality of the grape skin is a primary concern, as that component brings the tannins, color, and intensity of flavor to the wine. The process of desiccation not only concentrates the juices within the grape, but also increases the skin contact of the grapes. The drying process creates a polymerization of the tannins in the skin that contributes to the overall balance of the finished wine.

Typically, the length of the drying process is 120 days, but varies according to producer and the quality of the harvest. The most evident consequence of this process is the loss of weight: 35 to 45% for Corvina grapes, 30 to 40% for Molinara, and 27 to 40% for Rondinella. Following the drying process that is completed during the end of January or beginning of February, the grapes are crushed and go through a dry, low temperature fermentation process that may last up to 30 or 50 days. The reduced water content can slow down the fermentation process, increasing the risk of spoilage and potential wine faults, such as high volatile acidity. After fermentation, the wine must undergo a period of ageing of at least 2 years (calculated from 1 January of the year following the harvest). The ageing process takes place in wooden barrels, traditionally in big oak casks but also tonneau (500 lt) or barriques (225 lt) made of either French or Slavonian oak can be used.

===Variations===
If fermentation is stopped early, the resulting wine will contain residual sugar (more than 4 grams of sugar per litre) and produce a sweeter wine known as Recioto della Valpolicella. Recioto was the traditional wine produced according to this method, and originally, Amarone was Recioto wines that had fermented for too long. Unlike Amarone, Recioto della Valpolicella may be used to produce a sparkling wine. &quot;Ripasso&quot; is an Italian wine produced when the partially-aged Valpolicella is contacted with the pomace of the Amarone. Typically, this will take place in the spring following the harvest. The resulting wine is more tannic, with a deeper color, and having more alcohol and more extract. The word &quot;ripasso&quot; designates both the winemaking technique and the wine, and usually is found on a wine label.

==Characteristics and faults==
The final result is a very ripe, raisiny, full-bodied wine with very little acid. Alcohol content easily surpasses 15% (the legal minimum is 14%) and the resulting wine is rarely released until five years after the vintage, even though this is not a legal requirement.

The labor-intensive process of producing this wine poses significant risk for the development of various wine faults. Wet and rainy weather during harvest may cause the grapes to rot before drying out, requiring winemakers to be diligent in removing rotted bunches that can cause moldy flavors in the wine.

<doc id="290145" wikidata="Q537749" url="?curid=290145" title="Florida Keys">
<text>The Florida Keys are a coral cay archipelago off the southern coast of Florida, forming the southernmost part of the continental United States. They begin at the southeastern coast of the Florida peninsula, about south of Miami and extend in an arc south-southwest and then westward to Key West, the westernmost of the inhabited islands, and on to the uninhabited Dry Tortugas. The islands lie along the Florida Straits, dividing the Atlantic Ocean to the east from the Gulf of Mexico to the northwest, and defining one edge of Florida Bay. The southern part of Key West is from Cuba. The Keys are located between about 24.3 and 25.5 degrees North latitude.

More than 95% of the land area lies in Monroe County, but a small portion extends northeast into Miami-Dade County, such as Totten Key. The total land area is . At the 2010 census the population was 73,090, with an average density of , although much of the population is concentrated in a few areas of much higher density, such as the city of Key West, which has 32% of the Keys&#x27; total population. The 2014 Census population estimate was 77,136. The 2020 Census population estimate was 82,874.

The city of Key West is the county seat of Monroe County. The county consists of a section on the mainland which is almost entirely in Everglades National Park, and the Keys islands from Key Largo to Dry Tortugas National Park.

==History==
The Keys were originally inhabited by the Calusa and Tequesta people and were later charted by Juan Ponce de León in 1513. De León named the islands &quot;Los Martires&quot; (&quot;The Martyrs&quot;), as they looked like suffering men from a distance. &quot;Key&quot; is derived from the Spanish word &quot;cayo&quot;, meaning small island. For many years, Key West was the largest town in Florida, and it grew prosperous on wrecking revenues. The isolated outpost was well located for trade with Cuba and the Bahamas and was on the main trade route from New Orleans. Improved navigation led to fewer shipwrecks, and Key West went into a decline in the late nineteenth century. 

===Overseas Railway===
The Keys were long accessible only by water. This changed with the completion of Henry Flagler&#x27;s Overseas Railway in the early 1910s. Flagler, a major developer of Florida&#x27;s Atlantic coast, extended his Florida East Coast Railway down to Key West with an ambitious series of oversea railroad trestles. Three hurricanes disrupted the project in 1906, 1909, and 1910.

===1935 Labor Day hurricane===

The strongest hurricane to strike the U.S. made landfall near Islamorada in the Upper Keys on Labor Day, Monday, September 2, 1935. Winds were estimated to have gusted to , raising a storm surge more than above sea level that washed over the islands. More than 400 people were killed, though some estimates place the number of deaths at more than 600.

The Labor Day hurricane was one of only four hurricanes to make landfall at Category 5 strength on the U.S. coast since reliable weather records began (about 1850). The other storms were Hurricane Camille (1969), Hurricane Andrew (1992), and Hurricane Michael (2018).

In 1935, new bridges were under construction to connect a highway through the entire Keys. Hundreds of World War I veterans working on the roadway as part of a government relief program were housed in non-reinforced buildings in three construction camps in the Upper Keys. When the evacuation train failed to reach the camps before the storm, more than 200 veterans perished. Their deaths caused anger and charges of mismanagement that led to a Congressional investigation.

The storm also ended the 23-year run of the Overseas Railway; the damaged tracks were never rebuilt, and the Overseas Highway (U.S. Highway 1) replaced the railroad as the main transportation route from Miami to Key West.

===Seven Mile Bridge===

One of the longest bridges when it was built, the Seven Mile Bridge connects Knight&#x27;s Key (part of the city of Marathon in the Middle Keys) to Little Duck Key in the Lower Keys. The piling-supported concrete bridge is or 6.79 miles (10.93 km) long. The current bridge bypasses Pigeon Key, a small island that housed workers building Henry Flagler&#x27;s Florida East Coast Railway in the 1900s, that the original Seven Mile Bridge crossed. A section of the old bridge remains for access to the island, although it was closed to vehicular traffic on March 4, 2008. The aging structure has been deemed unsafe by the Florida Department of Transportation. Costly repairs, estimated to be as much as $34 million, were expected to begin in July 2008. Monroe County was unable to secure a $17 million loan through the state infrastructure bank, delaying work for at least a year. On June 14, 2008, the old bridge section leading to Pigeon Key was closed to fishing as well. While still open to pedestrians—walking, biking and jogging—if the bridge were closed altogether, only a ferry subsidized by FDOT and managed by the county would transport visitors to the island.

===Overseas Highway===

After the destruction of the Keys railway by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, the railroad bridges, including the Seven Mile Bridge, were converted to automobile roadways. This roadway, U.S. Highway 1, became the Overseas Highway that runs from Key Largo south to Key West. Today this highway allows travel through the tropical islands of the Florida Keys and the viewing of exotic plants and animals found nowhere else on the US mainland and the largest coral reef chain in the United States.

===Cuban exiles===
Following the Cuban Revolution, many Cubans emigrated to South Florida. Key West traditionally had strong links with its neighbor ninety miles south by water, and large numbers of Cubans settled there. The Keys still attract Cubans leaving their home country, and stories of &quot;rafters&quot; coming ashore are not uncommon.

===Conch Republic===

In 1982, the United States Border Patrol established a roadblock and inspection points on US Highway 1, stopping all northbound traffic returning to the mainland at Florida City, to search vehicles for illegal drugs and undocumented immigrants. The Key West City Council repeatedly complained about the roadblocks, which were a major inconvenience for travellers, and hurt the Keys&#x27; important tourism industry.

After various unsuccessful complaints and attempts to get a legal injunction against the blockade failed in federal court in Miami, on April 23, 1982, Key West mayor Dennis Wardlow and the city council declared the independence of the city of Key West, calling it the &quot;Conch Republic&quot;. After one minute of secession, he (as &quot;Prime Minister&quot;) surrendered to an officer of the Key West Naval Air Station (NAS) and requested US$1,000,000,000 in &quot;foreign aid&quot;.

The stunt succeeded in generating great publicity for the Keys&#x27; plight, and the inspection station roadblock was removed. The idea of the Conch Republic has provided a new source of revenue for the Keys by way of tourist keepsake sales, and the Conch Republic has participated in later protests.

==Geology==
The northern and central sections of the Florida Keys are the exposed portions of an ancient coral reef, the Key Largo Limestone. The northernmost island arising from the ancient reef formation is Elliott Key, in Biscayne National Park. North of Elliott Key are several small transitional keys, composed of sand built up around small areas of exposed ancient reef. Further north, Key Biscayne and places north are barrier islands, built up of sand. The islands in the southwestern part of the chain, from Big Pine Key to the Marquesas Keys, are exposed areas of Miami Limestone.

The Florida Keys have taken their present form as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glaciations or &quot;ice ages&quot;. Beginning some 130,000 years ago the Sangamonian Stage raised sea levels about feet above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida Platform, stretching south and then west from the present Miami area to what is now the Dry Tortugas. This reef formed the Key Largo Limestone that is exposed on the surface from Soldier Key (midway between Key Biscayne and Elliott Key) to the southeast portion of Big Pine Key and the Newfound Harbor Keys. The types of coral that formed Key Largo Limestone can be identified on the exposed surface of these keys. Minor fluctuations in sea level exposed parts of the reef, subjecting it to erosion. Acidic water, which can result from decaying vegetation, dissolves limestone. Some of the dissolved limestone redeposited as a denser &quot;cap rock&quot;, which can be seen as outcrops overlying the Key Largo and Miami limestones throughout the Keys. The limestone that eroded from the reef formed oolites in the shallow sea behind the reef, and together with the skeletal remains of bryozoans, formed the Miami Limestone that is the current surface bedrock of the lower Florida peninsula and the lower keys from Big Pine Key to Key West. To the west of Key West the ancient reef is covered by recent calcareous sand. While the islands of the upper and middle keys, consisting of Key Largo Limestone, form a long narrow arc, the islands of the lower keys are perpendicular to the line of that arc. This configuration arose from an ancient tidal-bar system, in which tidal channels cut through a submerged oolitic deposit. The bars lithified into Miami Limestone, and with changes in sea level are presently exposed as the islands, while the channels between the bars now separate the islands.

Just offshore of the Florida Keys along the edge of the Florida Straits is the Florida Reef (also known as the Florida Reef Tract), separated from the keys by the Hawk Channel. The Florida Reef extends from Fowey Rocks just east of Soldier Key to just south of the Marquesas Keys. It is the third-largest barrier reef system in the world.

==Environment==


The climate and environment of the Florida Keys are closer to that of the Caribbean than the rest of Florida, though unlike the Caribbean&#x27;s volcanic islands, the Keys were built by plants and animals. The Upper Keys islands are composed of sandy-type accumulations of limestone grains produced by plants and marine organisms. The Lower Keys are the remnants of large coral reefs, which became fossilized and exposed when the sea level dropped.

The natural habitats of the Keys are upland forests, inland wetlands and shoreline zones. Soil ranges from sand to marl to rich, decomposed leaf litter. In some places, &quot;caprock&quot; (the eroded surface of coral formations) covers the ground. Rain falling through leaf debris becomes acidic and dissolves holes in the limestone, where soil accumulates and trees root.

=== Flora and fauna ===

The Florida Keys have distinctive plant and animals species, some found nowhere else in the United States, as the Keys define the northern extent of their ranges. The climate also allows many imported plants to thrive. Some exotic species which arrived as landscape plants now invade and threaten natural areas.

The native flora of the Keys is diverse, including members of both temperate families, such as red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;), slash pine (&quot;Pinus elliottii&quot; var. &quot;densa&quot;) and oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.), growing at the southern end of their ranges, and tropical families, including mahogany (&quot;Swietenia mahagoni&quot;), gumbo limbo (&quot;Bursera simaruba&quot;), stoppers (&quot;Eugenia&quot; spp.), Jamaican dogwood (&quot;Piscidia piscipula&quot;), and many others, which grow only in tropical climates. Several types of palms are native to the Florida Keys, including the Florida thatch palm (&quot;Thrinax radiata&quot;), which grows to its greatest size in Florida on the islands of the Keys.

The Keys are also home to unique animal species, including the American crocodile, Key deer (protected by the National Key Deer Refuge), and the Key Largo woodrat. The Keys are part of the northernmost range of the American crocodile, which is found throughout the Neotropics. The Key Largo Woodrat is found only in the northern part of its namesake island and is a focus of management activities in Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge. About 70 miles (110 km) west of Key West is Dry Tortugas National Park.

The waters surrounding the Keys are part of a protected area known as the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

==Climate==
The climate of the Florida Keys is tropical savanna (Köppen climate classification: Aw). Other than some areas of coastal Miami (Miami Beach), the Florida Keys are the only areas in the continental United States to never report freezing temperatures since settlement. The record low in Key West is (in both 1886 and 1981), and low temperatures below are rare. Most of the Florida Keys fall into USDA zone 11a to 11b; Key West is zone 12a.

There are two main &quot;seasons&quot; in the Florida Keys, a hot and wet season from June through October, and a dry season from November through April, that features little rainfall, sunny skies, and warm breezy conditions. The warm and sunny winter climate, with average highs around and lows above , is the main tourist season in the Florida Keys. Key West is the driest city in Florida, and most of the Florida Keys can become quite dry at the height of the dry season. Some of the more exposed vegetation in the keys is scrub, stunted due to the intense sun, quick draining sandy soil, and arid winter climate. 
===Tropical cyclones===

The Keys are occasionally threatened by tropical storms and hurricanes, leading to evacuations to the mainland. Hurricane Georges, after destroying much of the housing and infrastructure on many of the Caribbean islands, caused damage and extensive flooding in the Lower Keys in 1998, before making landfall in Mississippi. In 2005, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma affected the Keys (although none made a direct hit), causing widespread damage and flooding. The most severe hurricane to hit the area was the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, a Category 5 hurricane.

Tropical cyclones present special dangers and challenges to the entire Keys. Because no area of the islands is more than above sea level (and many are only a few feet elevation), and water surrounds the islands, nearly every neighborhood is subject to flooding as well as hurricane winds. In response, many homes in the Keys are built on concrete stilts with the first floor being not legally habitable and enclosed by breakaway walls that are not strongly attached to the rest of the house. Nonetheless, Monroe County, as reported in the Federal Register, has estimated that there are between 8,000 and 12,000 illegal enclosures inhabited by people.

Because of the threat from storm surge, evacuations are routinely ordered when the National Weather Service issues a hurricane watch or warning, and are sometimes ordered for a tropical storm warning. Evacuation of the Keys depends on causeways and the two-lane highway to the mainland. Time estimates for evacuating the entire Keys range from 12 to 24 hours. Evacuation estimates are significant in emergency planning, of course, but also because they are a factor in local and state regulations for controlling development. The building permit allocation was increased in 2005 when local governments reduced estimates for evacuation.

On September 10, 2017, Hurricane Irma made landfall in Cudjoe Key. The storm destroyed an estimated 25% of the houses on the Keys and another 65% suffered major damage. Most residents had evacuated before the storm hit the area. On September 12, parts of the Keys were still inaccessible by causeway and some areas were closed to the public. Governor Rick Scott reported devastation; most areas were without power or water. The damage was the worst in the Lower Keys, though less severe in Key West; parts of the Lower Keys may be uninhabitable for months.

==Transportation==

The main chain of Keys islands can be traveled by motor vehicles on the Overseas Highway, a section of U.S. 1, which runs from Key West to Fort Kent, Maine in its entirety. The highway was built parallel to the original route of the Overseas Railway, which was not rebuilt following the Labor Day hurricane of 1935. Even before the hurricane, road sections and highway bridges allowed automobile traffic to travel from Miami to Lower Matecumbe Key, where a car ferry connected with another roadway section through the Lower Keys. Following the hurricane, some of the original railway bridges were converted to carry the highway roadbeds. These bridges were used until the 1980s, when new highway bridges were built alongside. Many of the original railroad and highway bridges remain today as pedestrian fishing piers.

===Public transportation===

The Florida Keys has public bus transportation.

===Road hazards===
Despite this reconstruction, U.S. 1 was not widened on a large scale, and today most of the route consists of just two lanes. Due to their tropical climate, the Florida Keys attract several hundred thousand tourists annually. While some visitors arrive via Key West International Airport and Florida Keys Marathon Airport in Marathon, cruise ship or ferry from Miami, Fort Myers, or Marco Island, Florida, the vast majority of tourists drive down from the mainland on U.S. 1. This influx of traffic, coupled with the two-lane nature of U.S. 1 through most of its length in the Keys, and the fact that no alternative road routes are available mean that Monroe County has the highest per capita rate of fatal automobile accidents in the state of Florida.

==Culture and recreation==
The major industries are fishing and tourism, including ecotourism, with many visitors scuba diving in the area&#x27;s protected waters. A ferry takes riders between Key West and Fort Myers, as well as Marco Island due north on the mainland, along the western edge of Florida Bay.

===Dark skies recreation===

Middle and Lower Florida Keys are among a few remaining South Florida dark skies locations accessible by car, thanks to their position along the Atlantic Ocean, and therefore with southern skies unobstructed by light pollution associated with urban development.

Scout Key is home to Winter Star Party, a prominent annual amateur astronomy event in the United States, and one of the Top 10 star parties in the world according to BBC Sky at Night. It is an international gathering that attracts 500+ people each year who enjoy stargazing, astrophotography and Milky Way photography.

Bahia Honda State Park is a well known dark skies location among locals offering unobstructed views of the southern night sky year-round. It also hosts amateur astronomy gatherings.

<text>Uziel &quot;Uzi&quot; Gal (, born Gotthard Glas; 15 December 1923 – 7 September 2002) was a German-born Israeli firearm designer who invented and became the eponym of the Uzi submachine gun.

==Biography==
Gal was born in Weimar, Germany to Miele and Erich Glas. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, he first moved to the United Kingdom and later in 1936 to Kibbutz Yagur in the British Mandate of Palestine, where he changed his name to Uziel Gal. 

In 1943, he was arrested for illegally carrying a gun and was sentenced to six years in prison. However, he was pardoned and released in 1946 (serving less than half of his sentence).

Gal began designing the Uzi submachine gun shortly after the founding of Israel and the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. In 1951, it was officially adopted by the Israel Defense Forces and was called the Uzi after its creator. Gal did not want the weapon to be named after him but his request was denied. In 1955, he was decorated with the Tzalash haRamatkal and in 1958, Gal was the first person to receive the Israel Security Award, presented to him by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion for his work on the Uzi.

Gal retired from the IDF in 1975, and moved to the United States the following year. He settled in Philadelphia so that his daughter, Tamar, who had serious brain damage, could receive extended medical treatment there.

In the early 1980s, Gal assisted in the creation of the Ruger MP9 submachine gun.

Gal also assisted film-actors like Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick in their training to use automatic weapons in their movie roles.

Gal continued his work as a firearms designer in the United States until his death from cancer in 2002. His body was flown back to Yagur for burial.

<text>OKC Will Rogers International Airport , also known as Will Rogers Airport or simply Will Rogers, is a passenger airport located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, about 6 miles (10 km) southwest of the city&#x27;s downtown area. It is a civil-military airport on of land. Although the official IATA and ICAO airport codes for OKC Will Rogers International Airport are OKC and KOKC, it is common practice to refer to it as &quot;WRWA&quot; or &quot;Will Rogers&quot;.

The airport is named for comedian and legendary cowboy Will Rogers, an Oklahoma native who died in an airplane crash near Utqiagvik, Alaska in 1935. The city&#x27;s other major airport, Wiley Post Airport, along with the Wiley Post–Will Rogers Memorial Airport in Utqiagvik, are named for Wiley Post, who also died in the same crash. The airport was the only airport to use &quot;World&quot; in its designation. Although Will Rogers offers U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) services for customs and immigration, there are currently no scheduled international flights.

OKC Will Rogers International Airport is the busiest commercial airport in the state of Oklahoma. In 2019, the airport handled nearly 4.42 million passengers, marking the busiest year on record three years in a row. Southwest Airlines carries the most passengers at OKC Will Rogers International Airport, with a market share of nearly 48% as of April 2022.

==History==
The airport first opened in 1911 as Oklahoma City Municipal Airfield. It was renamed in Rogers&#x27; honor in 1941.

During World War II, Will Rogers Field was a major training facility for the United States Army Air Forces; many fighter and bomber units were activated and received initial training there.

Army Air Forces groups known to have been stationed at Will Rogers Field include:
* 44th Bombardment Group (Heavy) July 1942 - August 28, 1942

After completion of their initial training, these units were reassigned to other airfields for secondary training before deployment overseas.

===Postwar===
The December 1951 C&amp;GS chart showed four runways: the 5497-ft runway 3, 3801-ft runway 8, 5652-ft runway 12 and 5100-ft runway 17.

The April 1957 OAG showed 21 daily nonstop departures on Braniff International Airways, 15 on American Airlines, five on Central Airlines, four on Continental Airlines and three on TWA. A TWA Constellation aircraft flew non-stop from Oklahoma City to Los Angeles, but eastward non-stops didn&#x27;t reach beyond Wichita, Kansas, Tulsa or Dallas, Texas. Oklahoma City began non-stop flights to Chicago starting in 1966.

===2000–present===
Great Plains Airlines, a regional airline based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, made Will Rogers World Airport a hub in 2001 with non-stop flights to Tulsa, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Colorado Springs, Colorado and direct or connecting flights to Nashville, Tennessee, St. Louis, Chicago, and Washington. The airline had hoped to reach additional East- and West-Coast markets but declared bankruptcy and ceased operations on January 23, 2004.

On May 31, 2013, an EF-1 tornado hit Will Rogers Airport. The 1.4-mile wide tornado traveled 10.4 miles, including across the northern side of the airport. The path of the tornado passed over the facilities of MetroTech, the FAA, the Oklahoma National Guard, AAR, the Four Points Hotel, and the passenger terminal and hangars on the north and east side of the airport. Minor damage was reported at AAR and other buildings in this path. The Parking Spot location north of the airport on Meridian Avenue was also hit by the tornado. The company decided in August 2013 not to re-open the facility and exit the OKC market.

The airport once partnered with Tinker AFB in presenting Aerospace America airshow.

On August 27, 2024, the city council of Oklahoma City approved a name change for the airport proposed by the OKC Airport Trust, officially changing the airport&#x27;s name from &quot;Will Rogers World Airport&quot; to &quot;OKC Will Rogers International Airport&quot;. The Trust attributed the name and logo change to a desire to market the airport to a wider audience. It was announced in 2024 that the airport plans to expand routes to Mexico and the Caribbean in 2025.

==Terminal==
In the late 1990s, the Oklahoma City Airport Trust deemed the 1967-built terminal building unsuitable. Following the adoption of a three-phase master plan, preparations for renovating the airport were launched in 2001. The old twin concourses (visible in the 1995 photograph) were demolished to make way for a larger terminal with integrated concourses, high ceilings, and modern facilities.

A $110 million multi-phase expansion and renovation project, designed by Atkins Benham Inc. and Gensler and built by Oscar J. Boldt Construction Company, began in 2001. Phase I involved erection of construction walkways from the five-story parking garage to the terminal building, demolishing the terminal&#x27;s existing elevator core, construction of new elevator and escalator cores on the tunnel level and on level one, building temporary entrance and exit ramps for vehicles approaching and leaving the terminal, reconstruction of the roofs of the lower level and level one, finishing the elevator and escalator cores to level two, building new permanent entry and exit ramps for vehicles, and construction of a new transportation plaza and driving lanes. Phase II included a new concourse constructed to the west of the central terminal area, which was renovated to match the interior and exterior designs of the new concourse. The 1960s-built concourses were then demolished after the new concourse opened in 2005. The entire phase was completed in November 2006. Phase III project calls for the construction of a new concourse to the east, with at least eight more gates as well as expanded retail, restaurant, and baggage areas.

Will Rogers World Airport has a single three-level terminal with 17 departure gates along the West Concourse (Gates 1–12), Central Concourse (Gates 14–24) East Concourse (Gates 26-32). Gate 32 is soon to be used for international flights. Gates on the south side use even numbers while those on the north use odd. Due to the terminal&#x27;s layout, certain odd numbers are omitted in the succession of Gates 1 through 32. Arriving passengers can access baggage claim in the downstairs level where there are 9 baggage belts. Level 3 contains offices for airline and airport staff.

The architecture of the current terminal uses native stone along with loft-ceilings, plate glass and brushed metal. Compared to the original terminal design of the old Concourses A and B, today&#x27;s terminal provides a more open feel similar to that found in larger hub airports.

The new East Concourse features 4 gates which hold exclusively Delta flights. This new concourse was completed in September 2021. It features a modern design and an observation deck for plane spotting. 

===Terminal expansion===
In 2008, Will Rogers World Airport officials approved a contract with Frankfurt Short Bruza Associates to begin planning for expansion. Officials later agreed to postpone the expansion plan due to the industry-wide decline in passenger traffic caused by the Great Recession.

During 2012, the Phase III expansion plan was updated to include a new Central Concourse reconfiguration plan. In 2014, the Airport Trust selected Option 2a, which includes only the central terminal improvements. The $3.6 million project will create a new central checkpoint in the center of the check-in hall. Two new greeter lobbies will be created where existing check points exist. The expansion will slightly reduce the space utilized by Sonic in the food court. The restrooms in the area will also be relocated to the nearby Osage room. The Southwest ticket counters will be relocated further east.

In 2015, the airport trust agreed to proceed with the full construction of the East Concourse due to increased congestion in the existing West and Central concourses and passenger demand. When completed, the existing terminal building would to the east and include a new passenger concourse initially with four gates, which would increase the number of boarding gates to 21. The new facility will have customs and immigration on the lower level accessed by the two easternmost gates and would serve international arrivals. The expansion will incorporate a single TSA screening zone in the center of the existing terminal, the food court will be removed and two reconstructed and arriving passengers would exit at the current TSA zones, which will be dramatically downsized into modern &quot;meeter-greeter areas&quot;. The East expansion will include onsite USAA military welcoming facilities, expanded concessions and office space, and an updated terminal lobby.

The new concourse expansion project will also include an innovative view system composed of an elevated platform and lounge that will allow visitors to walk above the newly expanded East Concourse and view down onto the secure gate areas and out to the airside. Visitors would enter the elevated walkway at the terminal lobby non-secured side. This design is intended to provide visitors the experience of airports of old; where one could walk all the way to the gate – albeit today completely separated from the secured concourse space. The expansion broke ground in March 2019 and opened in September 2021.

If necessary, a final expansion of the existing master plan could be accomplished with construction of the Central Concourse, increasing gate capacity by an additional 9 gates. This would give the terminal a final configuration with three concourses, East, West, and Central, and would provide the airport with 30+ gates.

===Rental car===
The airport opened a new Consolidated Rental Car Facility in early 2016, moving all rental services away from the Terminal to a grand facility nearby. Advantage, Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Enterprise, Hertz, National, and Thrifty rental companies offer service at Will Rogers World Airport. Shuttle buses connect passengers from the arrivals plaza just outside the terminal.

===Parking===
The airport began a $3.8 million maintenance project in September 2011 to rehabilitate and repair two of its three parking garages. The project will make improvements to garages A and B, two of the six parking options at the airport. Garage A is the two-story garage that provides hourly parking for the airport&#x27;s short-term visitors on the upper level, and &quot;ready-return&quot; spaces for the rental car agencies on the lower level. Parking Garage B, adjacent to A, is the older of the two five-level parking structures that provide covered parking for air travelers. Garage C, the new parking garage that opened in 2009, will not be impacted. Nearing middle age (Garage A is 44 years old and Garage B is 31 years old), the structures will undergo several different types of refurbishments that will extend the long-term use of the facilities. The work will include:

*Repair of concrete walls and pillars, specifically where there are cracks or spalling (chips of concrete that have broken off) and other deterioration
*Replacement or repair of exterior stairs
*Replacement and upgrade of all lighting circuits
*Replacement and upgrade of all lighting fixtures
*The top levels of each garage will receive new expansion joints, membrane coating, waterproofing and protectant to prevent leaking.

The project will be divided into 12 sequences, allowing the airport to keep as much of the garage open as possible. Most of the sequences will only require closing about 300 spaces at a time, leaving approximately 2,500 of the 2,800 total spaces in the two garages available for parking. The project work will start in the five-level Garage B on levels one and two. The entire project is anticipated to take 18 months. The most challenging portion of the project will be when the work commences on the two-story parking garage. During this sequencing, hourly parking and rental car companies will be moved to temporary locations in Garage B and C.

The airport operates three surface parking lots on the grounds of WRWA.

* Lot No. 1 is a long-term remote shuttle lot located on Amelia Earhart Drive. 
* Lot No. 2 is a long-term shuttle lot located directly adjacent to the parking garages on the north side.
* Lot No. 3 is a long-term canopy shuttle lot that provides shelter from sun and hail with protective canopies. It is located to the west of the parking garages on 67th Street near the control tower.

The airport provides a short-term parking area in the second (top) level of Garage A. The parking is free for the first hour and then $2 per hour after that. There are also two cell phone waiting areas just across the street from the shuttle parking lot No. 2, near Lot No. 3, and by the flag plaza north of the long-term shuttle Lot No. 2.

==Government and military operations==

===Will Rogers Air National Guard Base===
Until 2008, the Oklahoma Air National Guard&#x27;s 137th Airlift Wing (137 AW) and its Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft were located at the airport&#x27;s Will Rogers Air National Guard Base. As part of the 2005 round of Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) recommendations, the majority of the maintenance unit (excluding the munitions flight) was relocated to nearby Tinker Air Force Base, where the wing transitioned to the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft and became the 137th Air Refueling Wing (137 ARW), an &quot;Associate&quot; unit of the 507th Air Refueling Wing (507 ARW). The unit then shared KC-135 aircraft with the Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 507th Air Refueling Wing in a joint operations and maintenance program. On 30 Jun 2015, the 137 ARW / 507 ARW partnership at Tinker AFB officially ended. The 137th was transferred to Air Force Special Operations Command and redesignated as the 137th Special Operations Wing (137 SOW), flying the Beechcraft MC-12 Liberty, marking a return of ANG flight operations to Will Rogers.

The MC-12 Liberty Formal Training Unit (FTU) will be replaced by the L3Harris OA-1K FTU.

Will Rogers Air National Guard Base also continues to be the home of the unit&#x27;s Expeditionary Support Group headquarters, operations and support, as well as the Oklahoma ANG&#x27;s 146th Air Support Operations Squadron. The Oklahoma Army National Guard also carries out helicopter maintenance at the airport.

The Oklahoma City Composite Squadron of Civil Air Patrol meets on Tuesday evenings at 6:30 pm on the grounds of the Oklahoma Air National Guard base on the west side of the field.

The City of Oklahoma City Department of Airports manages Will Rogers World Airport and the other city-owned airports: Wiley Post Airport and Clarence E. Page Municipal Airport. The Airport Trust is led by Director Mark Kranenburg.

==Businesses and other onsite institutions==

===Corporate, air taxi===
Will Rogers World Airport has a separate terminal facility used by air taxi and corporate service, although most of these flights use the Wiley Post Airport, Oklahoma City&#x27;s FAA-designated reliever facility.

===Maintenance, repair, operations and fixed-base operations===
AAR Oklahoma has a fixed-base operation location, as well as a major maintenance, repair, and overhaul facility and regional headquarters at Will Rogers World Airport, in addition to other aircraft maintenance and aircraft on ground organizations.

ARINC has major facilities on the airport premises, including plans to double the size of their current facility.

Atlantic Aviation has a fixed-base operation located on the east side of the airport, off of Taxiway H. This is Atlantic&#x27;s first Greenfield project.

===Other facilities===
Southwest Airlines has one of its largest customer service and support centers on the northern grounds of Will Rogers World Airport.

Will Rogers World Airport is home to Metro Technology Center&#x27;s Aviation Career Campus. The aviation center offers training to prepare aircraft maintenance technicians with classrooms, practical labs, and separate airframe and powerplant hangars are available for academic and hands-on training. The Aviation Maintenance Technician program is an 18-month course that is certified and approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.

The facility is on the west side of the airport, north of the FAA center. One notable sight on the MetroTech campus includes a donated AirTran Airways DC-9-30 in the post AirTran Airways / ValuJet merger colors.

Will Rogers World Airport permanently hosts the Ninety Nines Museum of Women Pilots. The facility is located on more than , occupying the entire second floor of the International Headquarters building. It features a repository for a unique collection of the papers, personal items and other historic artifacts of some of the most significant achievements and adventures of the international community of women pilots. Its library and exhibit areas will provide new insights into the role women pilots played in the development of aviation.

===Lariat Landing===
Lariat Landing is a new development on the east side of the airport grounds that encompasses . The development is meant to generate increased non-airline revenue for the airport while still growing air service. The development will be mixed use with nearly half of it, west of Portland Avenue, designated to direct aviation support (with runway access) with an additional portion dedicated to aviation support companies. The remaining portion east of Portland Avenue will be zoned for retail, industrial, and commercial office space.

The direct aviation parcels of Lariat Landing will be marketed towards aircraft maintenance, aircraft manufacturing, commercial air cargo, and corporate aviation companies. Atlantic Aviation and ARINC are two tenants already located in the new development area. The aviation support district will be targeting companies that provides aviation related goods and services. The target companies include freight forwarders, logistics, cargo, warehousing, distribution operations, and manufacturing companies.

Located between Interstate 44 and Portland Avenue, the office park will have a retail village as the gateway to its campus. It will target offices, hotels/motels, retail, warehouse, distribution, and logistic companies.

Property will only be leased due to FAA requirements and will have a maximum term of 40 years. The realignment of Portland Avenue is currently in process while the new waterline installation has already been completed.

==Incidents==
On March 26, 1939, Braniff International Airways Trip 1, a Douglas DC-2, registration NC13727, crashed while attempting to return to the airport. The aircraft had just departed when a cylinder on the left engine tore loose from its mounting and caused a tear in the engine cowling. Subsequent drag from the torn cowling resulted in a stall on the wing, and the plane cartwheeled on to the airport grounds, just yards from the safety of the runway. The captain cut the fuel switches just before impact, but misted fuel from the tanks spread over the hot engines, causing a fire. The captain, first officer, and three passengers survived. The flight&#x27;s hostess and seven passengers, however, died in the disaster.

A Rockwell Sabreliner, registration N5565 crashed on January 15, 1974, after descending below minimums on an ILS approach in low clouds and fog. Both occupants were killed.

On December 21, 2012, a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Cessna Citation crashed during landing at Will Rogers Airport. Both occupants survived; one had minor injuries.

On November 15, 2016, a Southwest Airlines employee, Michael Winchester was shot and killed in a parking garage; a 45-year-old suspect, Lloyd Dean Buie, was subsequently found dead of an apparently self-inflicted wound. Winchester was the father of Kansas City Chiefs long snapper James Winchester and himself a former punter and member of the Oklahoma Sooners&#x27; 1985 national championship college team.

On June 19, 2024, Southwest Airlines Flight 4069 nosed down to an altitude of 525 feet above Yukon, Oklahoma, 9 miles from Will Rogers Int&#x27;l Airport, and received an automated altitude warning from air traffic control, but recovered to land safely at OKC without incident.

<text>Barolo ( , , ; ) is a red (DOCG) wine produced in the northern Italian region of Piedmont. It is made from the nebbiolo grape and is often described as one of Italy&#x27;s greatest wines.

The zone of production extends into the communes of Barolo, Castiglione Falletto, Serralunga d&#x27;Alba and parts of the communes of Cherasco, Diano d&#x27;Alba, Grinzane Cavour, La Morra, Monforte d&#x27;Alba, Novello, Roddi, and Verduno, all in the province of Cuneo, south-west of Alba. Although production codes have always stipulated that vineyards must be located on hillsides, the most recent revision of the production code released in 2010 goes further, categorically excluding valley floors, humid and flat areas, areas without sufficient sunlight, and areas with full-on northern exposures.

Barolo is often described as having the aromas of tar and roses, and the wines are noted for their ability to age and usually take on a rust red tinge as they mature. Barolo must be aged for at least 36 months after the harvest before release, of which at least 18 months must be in wood. When subjected to ageing of at least five years before release, the wine can be labelled as &quot;Riserva&quot;.

In the past, Barolo wines tended to be rich in tannin. It can take more than 10 years for the wine to soften and become ready for drinking. Fermenting wine sits on the grape skins for at least three weeks, extracting huge amounts of tannins, and is then aged in large, wooden casks for years. In order to appeal to more modern international tastes, those that prefer fruitier, earlier-drinking wine styles, several producers began to cut fermentation times to a maximum of ten days and age the wine in new French oak barriques (small barrels). &quot;Traditionalists&quot; have argued that the wines produced in this way are not recognizable as Barolo and taste more of new oak than of wine. The controversies between traditionalists and modernists have been called the &quot;Barolo wars&quot;.

==History==

Until recently it was believed that up to the mid-19th century, Barolo was a sweet wine. This was attributed to the fact that the nebbiolo grape ripens late in October, meaning that temperatures would be steadily dropping by harvest. By November and December, temperatures in the Piedmont region would be cold enough to halt fermentation, leaving a significant amount of residual sugar in the wine. Another popular idea was that in the mid-19th century, Camillo Benso, Conte di Cavour, the mayor of Grinzane Cavour, invited the French enologist Louis Oudart to the Barolo region to improve the winemaking techniques of the local producers. Using techniques focusing on improving the hygiene of the cellar, Oudart was able to ferment the nebbiolo must completely dry, making the first modern Barolo. This new, &quot;dry&quot; red wine soon became a favourite among the nobility of Turin and the ruling House of Savoy, giving rise to the popular description of Barolo as &quot;the wine of kings, the king of wines&quot;.

The idea that Barolo was once a sweet wine and that it took a French oenologist to turn it into a dry wine has been recently challenged, based on new research, by Kerin O&#x27;Keefe. According to this revision of Barolo&#x27;s history, Paolo Francesco Staglieno was responsible for the modern dry version. He was the author of a winemaking manual, &quot;Istruzione intorno al miglior metodo di fare e conservare i vini in Piemonte&quot;, published in 1835. It was Staglieno who was called upon by Camillo Benso, Conte di Cavour, who appointed him to the position of oenologist at his Grinzane estate between 1836 and 1841. Staglieno&#x27;s task was to produce quality wines geared towards ageing and stable enough to be exported. Staglieno fermented the wines dry, something that at the time was referred to as &quot;the Staglieno method&quot;. Oudart was a grape and wine merchant, not an oenologist, who in the early 1800s moved to Genoa and set up a winery, Maison Oudard et Bruché. By the time Oudart turned up in Alba, King Carlo Alberto and Cavour were already following Staglieno&#x27;s guidelines and both were producing dry wines. This revised version of the history of Barolo was positively accepted by other experts.

By the mid-20th century, wine production in the Barolo zone was dominated by large &quot;negociants&quot; who purchased grapes and wines from across the zone and blended them into a house style. In the 1960s, individual proprietors began estate bottling and producing single vineyard wines from their holdings. By the 1980s, a wide range of single-vineyard bottlings was available, which led to a discussion among the region&#x27;s producers about the prospect of developing a Cru classification for the area&#x27;s vineyards. The cataloguing of Barolo&#x27;s vineyards has a long history dating back to the work of Lorenzo Fantini in the late 19th century and Renato Ratti and Luigi Veronelli in the late 20th century, but as of 2009 there is still no official classification within the region. However, in 1980 the region as a whole was elevated to DOCG status. Along with Barbaresco and Brunello di Montalcino, Barolo was one of the first Italian wine regions to attain this designation.

===The Barolo wars===

In the 1970s and 1980s, trends in the worldwide market favoured fruitier, less tannic wines that could be consumed at a younger age. A group of Barolo producers, led by the house of Ceretto, Paolo Cordero di Montezemolo, Elio Altare, and Renato Ratti, started making more modern, international styles of Barolos by using shorter periods for maceration (days as opposed to weeks) and fermentation (usually 4872 hours or at most 810 days), less time ageing in new small oak barrels and an extended period of bottle ageing prior to release. By using modern technology, including specialized tanks that allow the wine to be pumped out from underneath the cap of skins and then pumped over, they found ways to maximize colour extraction and minimize harsh tannins. Prior to this &quot;modernist&quot; movement, nebbiolo was often harvested slightly unripe and at high yields, which left the grapes with harsh green tannins that had not had time to fully polymerize. To maximize colour extraction, producers subjected the wine to extended periods of maceration, taking up to several weeks, and then several years of ageing in large oak casks to soften the wine. Through the long slow process of oxidation, the perception of tannins lessened (such as occurs when decanting wine), but the fruit would also fade and become oxidized. The decline in fruit would no longer be able to balance the remaining harsh tannins, leaving a bitter, astringent wine with withered fruit. To counter this change, some producers would blend in other grape varieties such as Arneis and Barbera to add colour, fruit or softness to the wine.

Advances in viticulture have helped to bridge the gap between modern and traditional producers. Better canopy management and yield control have led to riper grapes being harvested earlier with more developed tannins in the grape skins. , winemaking for both traditionalist and modernist Barolo producers includes strict hygiene controls and the use of some modern winemaking equipment such as temperature-control fermentation vessels. Rather than fall into one hardline camp or the other, many producers take a middle-ground approach that utilizes some modernist techniques along with traditional winemaking. In general, the traditional approach to nebbiolo involves long maceration periods of 20 to 30 days and the use of older large &quot;botti&quot;-size barrels. The modern approach to nebbiolo utilizes shorter maceration periods of 7 to 10 days and cooler fermentation temperatures between that preserve fruit flavours and aromas. Towards the end of the fermentation period, winemakers often heat the cellars to encourage the start of malolactic fermentation, which softens some of nebbiolo&#x27;s harsh acidity. Modern winemakers tend to favour smaller barrels of new oak that need only a couple of years to soften the tannic grip of the wines. While new oak imparts notes of vanilla, it has the potential to cover up the characteristic rose notes of nebbiolo.

==Climate and geography==

The Barolo zone is located southwest of the Barbaresco zone with only the vineyards of Diano d&#x27;Alba planted with Dolcetto between the two nebbiolo strongholds. Compared to the Barbaresco zone, the Barolo zone is cooler and located on higher elevations, rising nearly above Barbaresco. The harvest of the late-ripening nebbiolo grape usually takes place in early to mid-October though some producers are experimenting with viticultural techniques that allow for an earlier harvest in late September. At harvest time, rains and downy mildew are two of the main hazards to worry about, along with early spring hail damage earlier in the growing season. Like most of south-central and southeastern Piedmont, the zone experiences a continental climate tempered by the Tanaro river and its tributaries - the Tallòria dell&#x27;Annunziata and Tallòria di Castiglione - that split the region into three main zones. To the west of the Tallòria dell&#x27;Annunziata is the commune of Barolo and La Morra. To the east of the Tallòria di Castiglione is the commune of Serralunga d&#x27;Alba located on one of the highest hilltops in the Barolo zone. Separated by a narrow valley to the west is the commune Monforte d&#x27;Alba located in the Monforte hills. Further upstream north, located in the v-shape spur between the two tributaries is the commune of Castiglione Falletto.

Located among the Langhe hills, the Barolo zone is a collection of different mesoclimate, soil types, altitudes and expositions that can have a pronounced effect on the development of the nebbiolo grape and the resulting Barolo wine. Within the Barolo zone there are two major soil types separated by the Alba-Barolo road. Within the communes of Serralunga d&#x27;Alba and Monforte d&#x27;Alba is a compact, sandstone-based soil dating from the Helvetian epoch. In the Barolo and La Morra zone, the soils are similar to those found in the Barbaresco zone, dating from the Tortonian period, being composed of calcareous marl that is more compact and fertile. Throughout the Barolo zone there are clay deposits and soil with enough alkalinity to tame nebbiolo&#x27;s naturally high acidity. In Jan 2007 Filippo Bartolotta indicated how a vertical tasting of Barolo, from 1985 to the present &quot;showcased Barolo&#x27;s longevity, intense aromatics, freshness, silk-and-cashmere tannins and also highlighted the considerable contrast between production zones&quot;.

Being dependent on a grape that is slow to ripen, global warming has had a beneficial influence on the Barolo zone. Theoretically, the increased temperatures of summer followed by mild autumns that promote misty fog that keeps the grapes from burning has helped to increase sugar levels and led to riper phenolic compounds such as tannins. To empirically link this to anthropogenic global warming is speculative. More likely, better vineyard management and winemaking techniques have contributed to a string of successful vintages for Barolo in the last 20 years.

==Wine region==

The present-day Barolo zone is located a little over southwest of Alba. While it is nearly 3 times the size of the nearby Barbaresco zone, it is still relatively small and is only wide at its widest point. In 1896, the Italian Ministry of Agriculture demarcated the Barolo production zone to include the communes of Barolo, La Morra, Castiglione Falletto, Serralunga d&#x27;Alba and the northern half of Monforte d&#x27;Alba. In 1909, the Agricultural Commission of Alba added the commune of Grinzane Cavour and parts of Novello and Verduno to the zone. When the region was designated as a &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) in 1966, parts of Cherasco, Diano d&#x27;Alba and Roddi were included with this delimitation of the Barolo zone staying unchanged through the zone&#x27;s promotion to DOCG in 1980. Despite these additions, over 87% of Barolo is produced in the original five communes of Barolo, La Morra, Castiglione Falletto, Serralunga d&#x27;Alba and Monforte d&#x27;Alba with Barolo and Castiglione Falletto considered the &quot;heart&quot; or unofficial &quot;classico&quot; areas of the zone. In addition to restrictions on yield and alcohol levels, to be labelled DOCG, a Barolo must be aged at least three years (a minimum of 38 months from November 1 the year of harvest), of which a minimum 18 months in wooden barrels. For wines labelled Barolo &quot;Riserva&quot;, five years of total ageing is required (a minimum of 62 months from November 1 the year of harvest), again with a minimum of 18 months in barrel.

The Barolo zone can be broadly divided into two valleys. The Serralunga Valley to the east includes the communes of Castiglione Falletto, Monforte d&#x27;Alba and Serralunga d&#x27;Alba. Planted with soils higher in sand, limestone, iron, phosphorus and potassium, the wines of Serralunga Valley tend to be austere and powerful and require significant ageing (at least 12–15 years) to develop. The Central Valley to the west includes the communes of Barolo and La Morra with soils higher in clay, manganese and magnesium oxide. This region tends to produce wines with more perfumed aromas and velvety textures. These wines tend to be less tannic and full-bodied than those from the Serralunga Valley and can require less ageing (8 to 10 years). The most widely planted and productive region of the Barolo zone is La Morra, which is responsible for nearly a third of all wine labelled as Barolo and produces twice as much wine as the next leading zone of Serralunga d&#x27;Alba.

===The &quot;crus&quot; of Barolo===

Since the late 19th century, efforts have been made to identify which vineyards in the Barolo zones produce the highest quality wine. Inspired by the prestige and high prices charged for Grand cru bottlings of Burgundy wine, Barolo producers began separating their holdings into individual vineyard lots and labelling the wines with these single-vineyard designations. The practice became so extensive that some producers were doing single-vineyard bottlings and charging high prices on all their holdings, regardless of whether the particular vineyard quality merited such a practice.

Led by prominent wine critic Luigi Veronelli, there was a push to have the vineyards of Barolo classified according to the quality of their produce. Winemaker Renato Ratti conducted an extensive study of the soils, geography and produce of vineyards throughout the area and mapped out individual plots based on their quality potential. The &quot;Ratti Map&quot; is still widely used by producers and negociants today. While there is no official designation of cru vineyard in the Barolo zone, both oral tradition and the history of high prices paid by negociants have elevated some vineyards to &quot;cru&quot; status in Barolo. In the commune of Barolo, the &quot;Cannubi&quot; and &quot;Sarmassa&quot; are considered &quot;cru&quot; class as well as the &quot;Brunate&quot; vineyard shared with the commune of La Morra. Also in La Morra are the highly esteemed &quot;Cerequio&quot; and &quot;Rocche&quot; vineyards. In Castiglione Falletto are the &quot;Monprivato&quot; and &quot;Villero&quot; vineyards. The commune of Serralunga d&#x27;Alba is home to the esteemed vineyards of &quot;Lazzarito&quot; and &quot;Vigna Rionda&quot; while the commune of Monforte d&#x27;Alba is home to the &quot;Bussia, Ginestra&quot; and &quot;Santo Stefano di Perno&quot; vineyards.

Below is a list of some the traditional &quot;crus&quot; of Barolo (divided by commune):

In 2010 the Barolo Consorzio introduced the &quot;Menzioni Geografiche Aggiuntive&quot; (additional geographic mentions) also known as &quot;MGA&quot; or &quot;subzones&quot;, after the Barbaresco Consorzio introduced them in 2007. 181 MGA were officially delimited, of which 170 were vineyard areas and 11 were village designations. Following the introductions of MGA for Barolo (and Barbaresco) the term Vigna (Italian for vineyard) can be used on labels after its respective MGA and only if the vineyard is within one of the approved official geographic mentions.

==Grape and wines==

Barolo wine is produced from the nebbiolo grape variety with the Lampia, Michet and Rosé clones authorized. The clusters are dark blue and greyish with the abundant wax that dresses the grapes. Their form is lengthened and pyramidal, with small, spherical grapes and substantial peel. The leaves are of average size with three or five nevertheless voluptuous lobes. Compared to the annual growth cycle of other Piedmontese grape varieties, nebbiolo is one of the first varieties to bud and later varieties to ripen with harvest taking place in mid to late October. In some vintages, other Piedmontese producers can pick and complete fermentation of their Barbera and Dolcetto plantings before Barolo producers have even begun their harvest. According to DOCG regulations, Barolos are to be composed of 100% nebbiolo. Historically producers would blend other grapes such as Barbera and today there is speculation that modern Barolo producers may be blending in Barbera, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah but there has been no conclusive proof of this practice. In the 1990s producers in the Barolo zone petitioned that the required nebbiolo content be lowered from 100% to 90% but this petition was eventually defeated.

Barolos tend to be rich, deeply concentrated full bodied wines with pronounced tannins and acidity. The wines are almost always lightly coloured varying from ruby to garnet in their youth to more brick and orange hues as they age. Like Pinot noir, Barolos are never opaque. Barolos have the potential for a wide range of complex and exotic aromas with tar and roses being common notes. Other aromas associated with Barolos include camphor, chocolate, dried fruit, damsons, eucalyptus, leather, licorice, mint, mulberries, plum, spice, strawberries, tobacco, white truffles as well as dried and fresh herbs. The tannins of the wine add texture and serve to balance Barolo&#x27;s moderate to high alcohol levels (Minimum 13% but most often above 15% ABV). Excessive extraction from prolonged maceration periods and oak ageing can give the wines an over-extracted bitterness.

Within the different communes of the Barolo zone, stylistic differences emerge due to differences in soil type. The calcareous marl soils of Barolo and La Morra are relatively fertile and tend to produce softer, more aromatic and fruity wines that age relatively sooner than Barolos from other parts of the zone. The less fertile, sandstone soils of the Monforte d&#x27;Alba and Serralunga d&#x27;Alba commune produce more intense, structured wines that need more time to mature. Castiglione Falletto is located on a spur between the two valleys with overlapping soil types. This region tends to produce wines with the elegance and aromatics of the Barolo commune and the structure of wines from Serralunga d&#x27;Alba.

===Barolo Chinato===

In the Piedmont region, old Barolo wine is used to make an after-dinner digestif known as Barolo Chinato. The bark from the South American cinchona tree is steeped in Barolo and then flavoured with a variety of ingredients, depending on the producer&#x27;s unique recipe. Some common ingredients of Barolo Chinato include cinnamon, coriander, iris flowers, mint and vanilla. The resulting beverage is very aromatic and smooth.

==Production==

A string of favourable vintages in the late 1990s led to an increase of price for Barolos and, in turn, led to increased plantings. Between 1990 and 2004 there was a 47% increase in nebbiolo plantings in the Barolo zone with under vine. The production subsequently increased from 7 million bottles in the mid-1990s to 10.25 million bottles in the mid-2000s. In the rush to increase plantings some of the less ideal sites previously used by Barbera and Dolcetto were gobbled up. It remains to be seen if these sites will be able to adequately ripen nebbiolo enough to produce quality Barolo that justifies the high price of the wine. Some experts are predicting a market correction similar to what was seen in the 1980s when a backlog of vintages caused prices to stabilize.

==Food pairing==

A big, powerful, tannic wine, Barolo needs to be matched with foods of similar weight. Paired with light dishes low in protein, such as steamed vegetables, a Barolo will overwhelm the food; its tannins will react with the proteins on the tongue and sides of the mouth, accentuating the bitterness and drying the palate. In Piedmont, the wines are often paired with meat dishes, heavy plates of pasta and rich risotti; the tannins bind to the food proteins and come across as softer.

<text>Tulsa International Airport is a civil-military airport five miles (8 km) northeast of Downtown Tulsa, in Tulsa County, Oklahoma, United States. It was named Tulsa Municipal Airport when the city acquired it in 1929; it received its present name in 1963. While Tulsa International Airport only serves domestic destinations, it is still an international airport since it has customs and border patrol facilities.

The 138th Fighter Wing of the Oklahoma Air National Guard is based at the co-located Tulsa Air National Guard Base. The airport is the global maintenance headquarters for American Airlines.

During World War II Air Force Plant No. 3 was built on the southeast side of the airport, and Douglas Aircraft manufactured several types of aircraft there. After the war this facility was used by Douglas (later McDonnell Douglas) and Rockwell International (later Boeing) for aircraft manufacturing, modification, repair, and research. Spirit AeroSystems currently builds commercial airline parts for Boeing aircraft in part of the building and IC Bus Corporation assembles school buses in the other part. Spirit AeroSystems also builds Boeing wing and floor beam parts and Gulfstream wing parts in a facility on the east side of the airport, just north of runway 26.

The Tulsa Air and Space Museum is on the northwest side of the airport.

==History==
Duncan A. McIntyre, an early aviator and native of New Zealand, moved to Tulsa in 1919. His first airport was located at Apache and Memorial and opened August 22, 1919. He moved and established a private airport on an 80-acre tract at the corner of Admiral Place and Sheridan Avenue. McIntyre Field had three hangars to house 40 aircraft and a beacon for landings after sundown.

McIntyre evidently closed his airport during the 1930s and merged it with R. F. Garland, a Tulsa oil man and owner of the Garland Airport at 51st and Sheridan Road for $350,000. He ran the airport and became the president of the new venture. This airport would later become the Brown Airport (after a number of owners and names including the commercial airport before it moved to 61st and Yale). In 1940, McIntyre accepted a position with Lockheed Corporation and moved to California.

Charles Lindbergh landed at McIntyre Field on September 30, 1927. He had been persuaded to visit Tulsa by William G. Skelly, who was then president of the local Chamber of Commerce, as well as a booster of the young aviation industry. In addition to being a wealthy oilman and founder of Skelly Oil Company, Skelly founded Spartan Aircraft Company. Lindbergh had already landed at Oklahoma City Municipal Airport, Bartlesville Municipal Airport and Muskogee&#x27;s Hatbox Field. All of these were superior to the privately owned McIntyre Field. Lindbergh pointed this out at a banquet given that night in his honor.

===Opening===
The initial municipal airport was financed with a so-called &quot;stud horse note&quot;, a promissory note like those used by groups of farmers or horse breeders who would collectively underwrite the purchase of a promising stud horse. The note would be retired with the stud fees paid for use of the horse. In the case of the Tulsa airport, the note would be paid from airport fees. Using this vehicle, Skelly obtained signatures from several prominent Tulsa businessmen who put up $172,000 to buy for a municipal airport. It opened July 3, 1928. The city of Tulsa purchased the airport, then named Tulsa Municipal Airport, in 1929, and put its supervision under the Tulsa Park Board. Charles W. Short was appointed Airport Director in 1929, and remained in this position until 1955.

The first terminal building was a one-story wood and tar paper structure that looked like a warehouse. The landing strips and taxiways were mown grass. Still, it handled enough passengers in 1930 for Tulsa to claim that it had the busiest airport in the world. The Tulsa Municipal Airport handled 7,373 passengers in February 1930 and 9,264 in April. This outpaced Croydon Airport, Berlin Tempelhof Airport, and Paris Le Bourget Airport for those months. Braniff Airways stopped at Tulsa on its original route between Chicago and Wichita Falls, and TWA stopped at Tulsa on its original route between Columbus and Los Angeles. Later in the 1930s, Tulsa became a stop on the American Airlines Chicago-Dallas route.

In 1932 the city opened a more elegant Art Deco terminal topped with a control tower. It was designed by Frederick V. Kershner, a lead architect working for Leon B. Senter. The structure was masonry with rounded corners, resulting in a futuristic appearance. Charles Short decorated the inside walls with a collection of early aviation photographs.

Although many Tulsans had concluded that the 1932 terminal was inadequate to serve the rapidly-growing city by the mid-1950s, the 1932 building served until Tulsa to construct a new terminal, east of the old facility. The new terminal would be designed by noted architect Robert Lawton Jones, who later said that his design was inspired by Mies van der Rohe Terminal design work began in November 1958 and the completed building opened November 16, 1961; on August 28, 1963, the facility was renamed Tulsa International Airport. The 1932 terminal was demolished in 1969 to make way for a runway expansion project.
In January 1928 Skelly bought the Mid-Continent Aircraft Company of Tulsa and renamed it the Spartan Aircraft Company. It first built a two-seat biplane, the Spartan C3 at its facility near the new airport. Later it would also build a low-wing cabin monoplane as a corporate aircraft, and the NP-1, a naval training plane used in World War II. In 1929 Spartan established the Spartan School of Aeronautics across Apache street from the new Tulsa airport to train fliers and support personnel. The Spartan School was activated by the U. S. Army Air Corps (USAAC) on August 1, 1939, as an advanced civilian pilot training school to supplement the Air Corps&#x27; few flying training schools. The Air Corps supplied students with training aircraft, flying clothes, textbooks, and equipment. The Air Corps also put a detachment at each school to supervise training. Spartan furnished instructors, training sites and facilities, aircraft maintenance, quarters, and mess halls.

===World War II===
The 138th Fighter Wing of the Air National Guard was organized at the Tulsa Airport in 1940 as the 125th Observation Squadron, then renamed when it deployed overseas during World War II. It is still based at TUL.

On January 4, 1941, the War Department announced that Tulsa would be the site of a $15 million plant. The Federal Government built Air Force Plant No. 3 on the east side of the airport. The plant was operated by Douglas Aircraft Corporation to manufacture, assemble and modify bombers for the USAAF from 1942 to 1945; production was suspended when World War II ended. The plant was reactivated in 1950 to produce the Boeing B-47 Stratojet and later the Douglas B-66 Destroyer. In 1960 McDonnell Douglas, the successor to Douglas Aircraft Corporation, continued to use the facility for aircraft maintenance. Rockwell International leased part of the plant to manufacture aerospace products. McDonnell Douglas terminated its lease in 1996. Boeing bought Rockwell International&#x27;s aerospace business in 1996, and took over much of the facility for aerospace manufacturing.

===Postwar===
In 1946 American Airlines acquired two former Air Force hangars to start a maintenance and engineering base at Tulsa Municipal Airport.

The April 1957 OAG shows 20 weekday departures on American, 18 Braniff, 6 Continental, 6 Central and 4 TWA. American had a DC-7 nonstop to New York, but westward nonstops didn&#x27;t get past Oklahoma City, Wichita and Dallas. (In 1947, when transcon flights made at least one stop, American had nonstops from Tulsa to San Francisco and Los Angeles.) In 1979 the airport was also served by Frontier Airlines, Scheduled Skyways and Texas International Airlines.

In 1967 the Tulsa Airports Improvement Trust (TAIT) was established as a public trust to build, operate, and maintain airport facilities for the city of Tulsa. TAIT has no authority to levy taxes and depends on airport revenues to repay airport-related debts. TAIT is independent of the city, but all board members are appointed by the Mayor of Tulsa and confirmed by the City Council. In October 1978 TAIT leased Tulsa International Airport and other city aviation facilities (other than police and fire heliports) to the city of Tulsa acting through the Tulsa Airport Authority (TAA), which agreed to disburse all airport-related income to TAIT. In July 1989, a lease amendment gave daily airport operation and maintenance responsibility to the TAA.

The Tulsa Air and Space Museum (TASM) was established in 1998 on the northwest side of the airport. The museum added the James E. Bertelsmeyer Tulsa planetarium in 2006.

In December 2000 TAIT guaranteed a loan to Great Plains Airlines in cooperation with the Tulsa Industrial Authority (TIA), the Bank of Oklahoma and the city of Tulsa. The TIA mortgaged Air Force Plant No. 3 for $30 million, which was loaned to Great Plains, and TAIT agreed to purchase the property if the airline defaulted. Great Plains went bankrupt in January 2004 and was unable to repay $7.1 million of the loan, but the loan guarantee was deemed to violate Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) policies prohibiting an airport authority from subsidizing a particular airline, and when the Bank of Oklahoma tried in June 2004 to collect the debt, TAIT declined to purchase the property from the TIA. The TIA promptly sued TAIT for violating the agreement and later added the city of Tulsa to the lawsuit in June 2008. The parties tried to settle the suit in August 2008 by repaying the TIA with $7.1 million of city funds, but this was challenged by a taxpayer group in a &quot;qui tam&quot; action, and the settlement was deemed illegal in October 2011 by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The TIA and the Bank of Oklahoma then sued TAIT for breach of contract in March 2013, seeking $15.6 million ($7.1 million in 2004 plus interest). The dispute was finally settled on 31 August 2015 with TAIT agreeing to pay $1.56 million to the TIA and the Bank of Oklahoma&#x27;s parent company and $125,000 to the Tulsa Regional Chamber.

===2010-Pre COVID-19===
Allegiant Air began service in 2013 to Orlando/Sanford. In 2015 Allegiant also began service to Las Vegas, Los Angeles International Airport, and St. Petersburg/Clearwater in 2015. TUL also saw a completed terminal renovation in 2015. Allegiant Air has had routes come and go such as New Orleans, Baltimore, and Nashville. Frontier Airlines returned once again in 2018 after pulling out of TUL a decade prior and began year-round service to Denver International Airport. Frontier also has been a victim of short lived routes in this timeframe such as Washington Dulles, San Jose (CA), Orlando, and San Diego. Former Regional Carrier Via Air served TUL with nonstop service to Austin from 2018 to 2019. American Airlines reunited year-round service to Los Angeles in April 2019 after the route was cut in the late 2000s. Allegiant Air began seasonal service to Destin/Fort Walton Beach in June 2019. During this time frame Runway construction took place along with the return of a jet bridge to gate B9 for Frontier&#x27;s return.

===COVID-19===
COVID-19 affected TUL like any other airport during the timeframe. New service on Allegiant Air to San Diego and Nashville along with a new Southwest Airlines seasonal service to Baltimore were all slated to start in the summer of 2020. Nashville was attempted but did poorly as expected considering the circumstance. Ultimately, the route was cut in August 2020. Tulsa International Airport rebounded very well from COVID-19 thus leading to many new routes and aircraft upgrades. The first began with American Airlines adding nonstop service to Phoenix Sky Harbor in November 2020 to attract leisure travel, this route was very successful, therefore, the route turned into a year-round service just a few months after flights began. Startup low-cost carrier Breeze Airways began service to TUL as the airport scored Breeze as one of their first 15 cities with nonstop service to New Orleans, San Antonio, and Tampa, flights began in the summer of 2021. American Airlines began a surge at Tulsa International Airport adding four new destinations within one year, nearly doubling their network with new services to Austin, Miami, New York–LaGuardia, and Washington–National. This was huge for TUL as many unserved markets were reunited at long last. Unfortunately, Tulsa did have some miscues to complement the new services. Breeze Airways discontinued service to New Orleans and San Antonio in November 2021. Allegiant Air also attempted service to Austin but was unsuccessful as the route was discontinued a little over a month after beginning. Allegiant Air began new seasonal service to Phoenix/Mesa and Sarasota in November and December 2021 respectively. Southwest Airlines launched two new routes for the first time in four years with service to Austin to complement American Airlines and the return of Chicago–Midway as Southwest served MDW till 2015 from Tulsa. Breeze Airways launched non-stop service to Nashville in June 2022 and will add Orlando in March 2023.

==Facilities==
The airport covers and has three paved runways:
* 18L/36R: , surface: grooved concrete
* 18R/36L: , surface: grooved asphalt
* 8/26: , surface: grooved concrete

As of August 31, 2023, the airport had 86,011 aircraft operations, average 235 per day: 40% commercial airline, 18% air taxi, 27% general aviation, and 15% military. 133 aircraft were based at the airport: 47 single-engine, 15 multi-engine, 46 jet, 3 helicopter and 22 military.

===Terminals===
The airport has a smaller regional terminal with newly renovated concourses. Concourse A, which houses Allegiant, American and Delta, has 11 departure gates: A1 through A11. Currently, seven of those are in use. Concourse B, opened in 2012, has ten gates, but only seven have jet bridges. Southwest and United use Concourse B.

In 2010, a renovation of the 1960s-era terminal began. The renovations were designed by Gensler and Benham Companies. Concourse B (home to Southwest and United) underwent a $17.9 million renovation between September 7, 2010 and January 18, 2012, including major HVAC replacement along with the more noticeable design changes. These changes include sky lights and raising the somewhat low ceilings in the concourse area, improved passenger waiting areas and gate redesigns. Concourse A (home to Allegiant, Delta, American and US Airways before its merger with American) subsequently underwent renovation and upgrades which were completed in 2015.

===American Airlines Maintenance Facility===
TUL is the headquarters for all Maintenance and Engineering activities at American Airlines worldwide, and is the maintenance base for the airline&#x27;s fleet of Airbus A320 family, Boeing 787 and Boeing 737 aircraft – a combined total of nearly 800 airplanes. It employs over 5,000 people, with the majority as licensed aircraft and jet engine mechanics. According to the company, it is one of the largest private employers in Oklahoma.

While many other major domestic airlines (e.g., United, Northwest and US Air) were closing their maintenance facilities and outsourcing the work to major contractors in the early 2000s, American consolidated these activities at the MRO. The airline vowed to make the center as cost-effective as private centers and attract some of this work from other airlines as well. AA won major cost concessions from its own employees, pledged to relocate all its Boeing 737 heavy maintenance work to Tulsa, along with its work on the GE CFM-56 engine work. It also contains a wheel-and-brake overhaul facility and composite repair center. AA received $22 million in funding from Tulsa&#x27;s Vision 2025 program that helped it buy machines, tooling and test equipment that only original-equipment manufacturers previously had. This funding helped it get contracts for maintenance work from Synergy Aerospace for F100 aircraft; Aeroserve, for JT8 engine work; GE Aviation Materials, for work on CF6-80 engines; Omni Air International and Vulcan Flight Management for work on Boeing 757 aircraft; and Aero Union for work on A300 landing gear.

The MRO occupies about and of maintenance &quot;plant&quot; at the Tulsa Airport. Each year, the base performs major overhaul work on about 80% of American&#x27;s fleet. It also does aircraft maintenance for other carriers on a contract basis.

On 28 February 2020, American Airlines announced an investment of half billion US dollars for the MRO base that will include two new hangars, including a 193,000-square-foot facility big enough to hold six narrow-body planes, such as a Boeing 737, or two larger planes.

===Lufthansa Technik Component Services===
Lufthansa Technik Component Services LLC (LTCS), a subsidiary of Lufthansa Technik AG, is headquartered at Tulsa Airport. LTCS provides maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services to airlines. The Tulsa location includes the departments of Production and Product Development Engineering, the department of Finance and Controlling as well as Human Resources Management, Strategic Purchasing and a Customer Service team. The workshops and various department occupy an area of .

==Public transportation==
There is no scheduled public transport service to the main terminal. Uber and Lyft are common. A taxi stand is present, but a taxi is not always available. Bus stops are 1.2 to 1.3 miles from the terminal.

===Departures / arrivals===
Although generally single-level, the entry section of the airport has separate departure and arrival curbs; the inner Apache Drive for departures and outer Airport Drive for arrivals. Baggage claim carousels are located on Airport Drive on the Arrival upper-level curb. TIA has six baggage carousels in service. Currently American Airlines, Delta, and Allegiant on carousels 1, 2, and 3, and Southwest, United, and Frontier are 4, 5, and 6.

===Industrial land development===
In 2008, Tulsa Airport Authority began a new industrial land development project. Aerospace is one of the Oklahoma&#x27;s largest industry clusters with 400 companies that directly or indirectly employ more than 143,000 people with a payroll of $4.7 billion and an industrial output of $11.7 billion. Tulsa is ranked eighth nationally for the size of its aerospace engines manufacturing cluster and 20th for its defense-related cluster.

TUL&#x27;s central location in the south is easily accessible by a multi-modal transportation network. With a total of and 14,000 on-airport employees, Tulsa is a large center of aviation activity. Six sites totaling over of real estate will be developed. Each of the sites can be divided into smaller lots to meet any organization&#x27;s individual needs.

===HP Enterprise Services building===
The HP Enterprise Services (formerly EDS) building hosting some of Sabre&#x27;s datacenter servers is located at the Tulsa Airport. The company applied a reflective material on the roof to reduce heat gain, thereby reducing the air conditioning power consumption. In front of this building is a 6-foot sculptured penguin, given to the company as part of a local art campaign by the Tulsa Zoo.

==Accidents and incidents==
* June 10, 1950: a USAF Douglas C-47 lost power on takeoff and crashed into an aviation school barracks. Three men were injured, one fatally.
* January 6, 1957: American Airlines Flight 327, a Convair CV-240, struck trees 3.6 miles north of the airport and slid some 540 feet. One person was killed out of the 10 on board.
* January 8, 1965: The pilots of Central Airlines Flight 168, a Convair CV-240, diverted to Tulsa and performed an intentional belly landing after repeated unsuccessful attempts to lower the landing gear. The aircraft was substantially damaged but the nine passengers and three crew were not significantly injured.
* September 15, 1987: Eastern Air Lines Flight 216, a Boeing 727 carrying 55 passengers and 7 crew, was seriously damaged in a hard landing. The aircraft was inspected by mechanics at the American Airlines Tulsa maintenance base and cleared to fly; it was then flown to Kansas City and Chicago with passengers, only to be removed from service after skin wrinkles in the fuselage were noticed. An American Airlines official later said that the Tulsa mechanics erred in their inspection. The accident was attributed to the pilot&#x27;s decision to disregard a hazardous weather advisory and land in severe winds.
* February 22, 1991: A Mitsubishi MU-2B-60, registration number N274MA, rolled over and crashed in a steep inverted dive after takeoff; the three occupants were killed. Investigators found the right-hand propeller feathered, the left spoiler deployed, and the rudder trim control in the neutral position; emergency procedures for the MU-2 dictated that after an engine is shut down, rudder trim should be applied &quot;as soon as possible&quot; to prevent spoiler deployment. The accident was attributed to the shutdown of one engine for unverified reasons, the failure of the pilot to maintain VMCA, and the pilot&#x27;s improper emergency procedure.
* December 28, 1992: A Beechcraft C24R Sierra, registration number N3809Q, struck trees during an Instrument Landing System approach at night in low visibility, killing the pilot and two passengers. The accident was attributed to &quot;The pilot&#x27;s disregard of and descent below the published decision height. Factors were his failure to maintain proper glide path and localizer alignment.&quot;
* November 25, 1994: UPS Airlines Flight 732, a Boeing 757-24APF, sustained severe structural damage in a tailstrike on landing. There were no injuries to the two pilots. The accident was attributed to the failure of the pilot to maintain VREF and an improper landing flare. The aircraft was subsequently repaired and placed back in service.
* October 27, 1995: A Beechcraft B95 Travel Air, registration number N9943R, overran Runway 36L on takeoff and struck a tree and railroad tracks, killing the pilot and sole occupant. Investigators attributed the accident to the pilot&#x27;s failure to remove the flight control gust locks during the preflight inspection, and the pilot&#x27;s subsequent failure to abort the takeoff.
* July 10, 2010: A Cessna 421, registration number N88DF, experienced a double engine failure and crashed on approach, killing the two pilots and single passenger. The aircraft was low on fuel, but the pilot did not declare an emergency, and accepted a landing clearance on Runway 18R despite being significantly closer to 18L. The accident was attributed to &quot;The pilot&#x27;s inadequate preflight fuel planning and management in-flight, which resulted in total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. Contributing to the accident was the pilot&#x27;s use of performance-impairing medications.&quot;

<text>GS/OS is an operating system developed by Apple Computer for its Apple II personal computer. It provides facilities for accessing the file system, controlling input/output devices, loading and running program files, and a system allowing programs to handle interrupts and signals. It uses ProDOS as its primary filing system. GS/OS is a component of Apple II System Software versions 4.0 through 6.0.1, and was the first true 16-bit operating system for the II.

==Features==

===Speed optimization===
The advantage of GS/OS over its predecessor, the ProDOS 16 operating system, is that it was written entirely in 16-bit code for the 65816 processor used in the II, rather than primarily in 8-bit 6502 machine code that does not take advantage of the II&#x27;s unique features. This in turn allows GS/OS to offer vast speed optimizations (loading time, disk access, screen updates) compared with the previous OS, and provided room to incorporate many features of other Apple operating systems, including Apple III Apple SOS, the Macintosh System 5, as well as concepts and features that would later appear in future Macintosh System Software releases (e.g. proportional scrollbars, thermometer progress bars).

===New features and enhancements===
In addition to continued enhancements to the IIGS Finder and loadable fonts, GS/OS offered plug-in device drivers (modem, printer, etc.), a thermometer progress display, AppleShare support, File System Translators for accessing foreign file formats, disk caching and support for storage devices up to 4 Gigabytes. It also extends the ProDOS file system to provide for resource forks on files similar to those used on the Apple Macintosh, which allows for programs to be written in a more flexible way. The newly included Apple &quot;Advanced Disk Utilities&quot; and &quot;Apple IIGS Installer&quot; helped facilitate partitioning, formatting and installing software and drivers with visual ease. A command-line development environment called APW (Apple Programmer&#x27;s Workshop) is available; much like the Macintosh Programmer&#x27;s Workshop.

===File System Translators===
GS/OS includes a facility known as file system translators (FSTs) which allows it to support multiple on-disk file systems in a manner transparent to application programs and to the user, a feature not found in ProDOS or most other microcomputer operating systems at the time. While GS/OS natively uses the ProDOS file system (from which it must be booted), it also fully supports HFS used by Mac OS. Other file system translators include those for MS-DOS, High Sierra/ISO-9660, Apple DOS 3.3, and Pascal, albeit read-only (full read/write support had been planned but was never completed).
