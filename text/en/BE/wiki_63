<text>The Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering (formerly known as the Carnegie Institute of Technology) is the academic unit that manages engineering research and education at Carnegie Mellon University. The College can trace its origins from Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s founding of the Carnegie Technical Schools. Today, The College of Engineering has seven departments of study.

== History ==

By 1905, the massive buildings of the Carnegie Technical Schools were being constructed in a field east of the University of Pittsburgh. The first students of the School of Science and Technology began classes in unfinished buildings, still surrounded by new construction. The school initially offered two- and three-year programs to train the children of Pittsburgh&#x27;s working class. After the merger between Carnegie Tech and the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, the newly formed Carnegie Mellon University&#x27;s College of Engineering and Science was divided into the Carnegie Institute of Technology (engineering) and the Mellon College of Science. Subsequently, the Carnegie Institute of Technology was re-branded as the College of Engineering. The Department of Mechanical Engineering was organized by professor Willibald Trinks who thereafter headed it for 38 years. 

==About the College of Engineering==
Enrollment for or the 2017–2018 academic year was 1,783 full-time undergraduate, 1,383 master&#x27;s, and 703 doctoral students. The college employs 207 faculty members whose research is recognized and supported by such sources as the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the Environmental Protection Agency. As part of Carnegie Mellon University, the College of Engineering works to carry out the university&#x27;s mission of “changing the needs of society by building on its traditions of innovation, problem-solving and interdisciplinarity”.

The College&#x27;s Office of the Dean is housed in Scaife Hall, and the college&#x27;s primary facilities include Hamerschlag Hall, Roberts Engineering Hall, Doherty Hall, and Scott Hall, in addition to Scaife.

===Engineering and Public Policy===
The Department of Engineering and Public Policy, informally known as &quot;EPP&quot;, is a pioneering, interdisciplinary academic department within the Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering. EPP combines technical analysis with social science and policy analysis, in order to address problems in which knowledge of technical details is critical to decision making. The primary purpose of the EPP program is to educate students to work at the interface of the social and engineering sciences, through use of an interdisciplinary curriculum based equally on social analysis and engineering analysis. EPP offers a double-major undergraduate degree, multiple masters degree programs, and a doctoral studies program. Undergraduate students receive a Bachelor of Science degree from one of the traditional engineering departments plus EPP.

EPP works in a variety of research areas on problems that involve the interaction of technology with society. These include:

# Energy and environment (including climate);
# Risk analysis and communication;
# Information and communication technology policy;
# Management of technical innovation and R&amp;D policy.

Across these four focal areas, the department addresses issues in technology and organizations, and in technology and economic development, focusing in particular on India and China. EPP also develops new software tools for the support of policy analysis and research, and studies issues in engineered systems and security.

<text>The Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, also known as Heinz College, is the public policy and information college of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It consists of the School of Information Systems and Management and the School of Public Policy and Management. The college is named after CMU&#x27;s former instructor and the later U.S. Senator John Heinz from Pennsylvania.

The Heinz College educational process integrates policy analysis, management, and information technology. Coursework emphasizes the applied and interdisciplinary fields of empirical methods and statistics, economics, information systems and technology, operations research, and organizational behavior. In addition to full-time, on campus programs in Pittsburgh, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, and Adelaide, the Heinz College offers graduate-level programs to non-traditional students through part-time on-campus and distance programs, customized programs, and executive education programs for senior managers.

== History ==

Richard King Mellon and his wife Constance had long been interested in urban and social issues. In 1965, they sponsored a conference on urban problems, in which they began discussions with the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University to create a school focused on public affairs. In 1967, Carnegie Mellon President H. Guyford Stever, Richard M. Cyert, Dean of the Tepper School of Business, and Professors William W. Cooper and Otto Davis met and formed a university-wide committee to discuss creating a school that would train leaders to address complex problems in American urban communities. Davis was asked to draft a proposal to create such a school and focused on applying the Tepper School of Business&#x27; pioneering quantitative and skill-based approach to management education as well as technology to public sector problems.

In 1968, William Cooper and Otto Davis presented the final proposal for the School of Urban and Public Affairs (SUPA) to the Richard King Mellon Foundation. The proposal found favor with R. K. Mellon and he became strongly committed to creating such a school. The R. K. Mellon Foundation sent a proposal to President Stever to finance it with an initial grant of $10 million, and on 1 November 1968, President Stever created the School of Urban and Public Affairs with William Cooper as the first dean. The school initially drew much of its faculty from the Tepper School of Business and was based in the Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall. Eventually, the school became independent of other colleges within the university and moved to its current location in historic Hamburg Hall when the facility was acquired by the university from the U.S. Bureau of Mines. Subsequent Deans include Otto Davis, Brian Berry, Joel A. Tarr, Alfred Blumstein, former Carnegie Mellon Provost Mark Kamlet, Linda C. Babcock, Jeffrey Hunker, Mark Wessel, and current dean Ramayya Krishnan.

In 1992, Teresa Heinz donated a large sum of money to the school, which was then renamed as the H. John Heinz III School of Public Policy and Management in honor of Mrs. Heinz&#x27;s late husband, Senator H. John Heinz III. Senator Heinz, heir to the H. J. Heinz Company fortune, had been killed when his small private plane crashed one year before.

In 2007, the Heinz School received a grant from the Heinz Foundations that transformed the school into a college and formalized the School of Information Systems &amp; Management alongside the School of Public Policy &amp; Management under the college&#x27;s administration. The official launch of the H. John Heinz III College of Information Systems and Public Policy was held on October 24, 2008 during Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s Homecoming weekend and was led by Dean Krishnan, Teresa Heinz, and former United States Secretary of the Treasury Paul O&#x27;Neill.

== Facilities ==

Heinz College is headquartered in Hamburg Hall, a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designed by noted Beaux-Arts architect Henry Hornbostel. Hamburg Hall is named for Lester A. Hamburg, an industrialist and philanthropist active in the Pittsburgh Jewish Community. The Heinz College also has a branch campus in Adelaide, South Australia, which offers master&#x27;s degrees in Public Policy and Management and Information Technology. Heinz College also maintains a North Hollywood center in Los Angeles as part of the jointly administered master&#x27;s degree program in Entertainment Industry Management, and a center in Washington, DC on Capitol Hill for students in the Public Policy and Management masters program.

Carnegie Mellon is in the process of renovating and expanding the Heinz College&#x27;s Pittsburgh facilities through a four-phased process across Forbes Avenue from the 2013-announced Tepper Quadrangle. The ultimate plan for Hamburg Hall is to capture new space – approximately 20,000 square feet – by enclosing the courtyard between the rotunda, the East and West Wings, and the adjacent Elliott Dunlap Smith Hall with a soaring glass roof structure. This new space will include a large, multi‐purpose Classroom of the Future, lounges, meeting/study space, and a café. Phase I of renovations and expansion of Hamburg Hall was entirely financed by Heinz College and was completed in September 2013. Heinz College students immediately benefited from convenient access to the new student services and computing services suites. The construction of new career services interview rooms provides up‐to‐date facilities for on‐campus recruiters.

A December 2013 gift from The Heinz Endowments combined with gift commitments from other donors enabled the Heinz College to expedite the final architectural design of Phase II elements, finalize necessary construction planning, commence renovations and expansion, and complete a structure that will add additional value to the college. A new 150-seat auditorium in the courtyard between Hamburg Hall and Smith Hall was constructed, and both levels of the rotunda were transformed into student study and lounge spaces as well as a grand entrance and lobby area, and renamed as the Teresa Heinz Rotunda. The new auditorium allows the college to host high-profile speakers. Further, the west wing of Hamburg Hall now consists of forward-looking classrooms in the space that was vacated by the Engineering Research Accelerator when it moved to the newly constructed Scott Hall. An additional entrance from Forbes Avenue was also constructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;12/03/2014 Town Hall Meeting&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During Phase III the addition to Hamburg Hall, including a glass roof, end walls, café, and study space, will be constructed. Fire protection and elevator improvements will also be addressed as well as the addition of new classrooms (including designated executive education rooms). The addition of 20,000 square feet to Hamburg Hall will allow the Heinz College to continue to grow student enrollment. This phase is planned for completion by 2017.

The final phase, Phase IV, will renovate third-floor faculty and PhD offices and meeting spaces.

The new additions and renovations will be designed to achieve LEED Silver certification.

<doc id="286581" wikidata="Q666027" url="?curid=286581" title="German orthography reform of 1996">
<text>The German orthography reform of 1996 (&quot;&quot;) was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language. 

The reform was based on an international agreement signed in Vienna in July 1996 by the governments of the German-speaking countries—Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Luxembourg did not participate despite having German as one of its three official languages: it regards itself &quot;as a non-German-speaking country not to be a contributory determinant upon the German system of spelling&quot;, though it did eventually adopt the reform.

The reformed orthography became obligatory in schools and in public administration. However, there was a campaign against the reform, and in the resulting public debate the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany was called upon to delineate the extent of reform. In 1998 the court stated that because there was no law governing orthography, outside of the school system people could spell as they liked, including the use of traditional spelling. In March 2006, the Council for German Orthography agreed unanimously to remove the most controversial changes from the reform; this was largely, though not completely, accepted by media organizations such as the &quot; that had previously opposed the reform.

The rules of the new spelling concern the following areas: correspondence between sounds and written letters (this includes rules for spelling loan words), capitalisation, joined and separate words, hyphenated spellings, punctuation, and hyphenation at the end of a line. Place names and family names were excluded from the reform.

==New rules==

===Sounds and letters===
The reform aimed to systematise the correspondence between sounds (phonemes) and letters (graphemes), and to strengthen the principle that derived forms should follow the spelling of the root form.

ß and ss: In reformed orthography the grapheme (a modernised typographical rendering of how &#x27; appeared in traditional Gothic script; it is seldom used in Switzerland) is considered a separate letter that is to appear only after long vowels and diphthongs. In general in German, long stressed vowels are followed by single consonants, and short stressed vowels by double consonants. In the traditional orthography, &#x27; was written instead of &#x27; if the &quot;s&quot; phoneme belonged to only one syllable, thus in terminal position and before consonants &#x27; was always written as &#x27;, without regard to the length of the preceding vowel. In the reformed orthography, a short stressed vowel is never followed by &#x27;. This brings it into line with the two-letter spelling of other final consonants (&#x27;). Thus &#x27; – &#x27; (previously &#x27; – &#x27;), by analogy to &#x27; – &#x27; . This contrasts with &#x27; – &#x27; , analogous to &#x27; – &quot; .

Nevertheless, the new German spelling is not fully phonemic, and it is still necessary to know the plural of a noun in order to spell its singular correctly: &#x27; – &#x27; , &#x27; – &#x27; (it is however morphophonemic; cf. the usage of voiced versus voiceless plosives at word end).

Exempted from change are certain very common short-vowelled words which end in a single &#x27;s&#x27; (such as &#x27;), echoing other undoubled final consonants in German (e.g. &#x27;). So the frequent error of confusing the conjunction &#x27; (previously &#x27;) and the relative pronoun &#x27; has remained a trap: &#x27; (I hope that she comes.) &quot; (The house that stands there.) Both are pronounced .

The so-called &quot;s&quot; rule makes up over 90% of the words changed by the reform. Since a trailing &#x27; does not occur in the traditional orthography (which uses &#x27; instead), the &#x27; at the end of reformed words like &#x27; and &#x27; (previously &#x27;) is now the only quick and sure sign to indicate that the reformed spelling has been used, even if just partly, in texts (except those of Swiss origin). All other changes are encountered less frequently and not in every text.

Triple consonants preceding a vowel are no longer reduced (but hyphenation is often used in these instances anyway):
* &#x27; became &#x27; from &#x27; (ship) + &#x27; (journey)
In particular, triple &quot;s&quot; now appears more often than all the other triple consonants together, while in the traditional orthography they never appear.
*&#x27; → &#x27;

Doubled consonants appear after short vowels at the end of certain words, to conform with derived forms:
* &#x27; → &#x27; because of plural &quot; (ace, aces)
* &#x27; → &#x27; because of the verb &quot;

Vowel changes, especially &#x27; for &#x27;, are made to conform with derived forms or related words.
* &#x27; → &#x27; (stalk) because of &quot; (pole)

Additional minor changes aim to remove a number of special cases or to allow alternative spellings
* &#x27; → &#x27; (rough) for consistency with &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;

Several loan words now allow spellings that are closer to the &quot;German norm&quot;. In particular, the affixes &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27; can be spelled with &#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

===Capitalisation===
Capitalisation after a colon is now obligatory only if a full sentence or direct speech follows; otherwise a lower-case letter must go after a colon.

The polite capitalisation of the &quot;formal&quot; second-person pronouns (, , and ) was retained. The original 1996 reform also provided that the &quot;familiar&quot; second-person pronouns (, , , , , , and ) should not be capitalised, even in letters, but this was amended in the 2006 revision to permit their optional capitalisation in letters.

The reform aimed to make the capitalisation of nouns uniform and clarify the criteria for this. In the original 1996 reform, this included the capitalisation of some nouns in compound verbs where the nouns had largely lost their capitalisation when becoming a part of the compound verb, for instance changing to (&quot;ice running&quot; = to ice-skate) and to (to stand on one&#x27;s head). However, this was reversed in the 2006 revision, restoring verbs like and .

===Compound words===
As before, compound nouns are generally joined into one word, but several other compounds are now separated.

Nouns and verbs are generally separated (but see above):
* → (to ride a bicycle)

Multiple infinitive verbs used with finite verbs are separated:
* → (to get to know)
* → (to go for a walk)

Other constructions now admit alternative forms:
* or (instead of)

There are some subtle changes in the meaning when the new forms collide with some pre-existing forms:
* → (literally &quot;much promising&quot;, but the meaning of the long compound adjective is &quot;promising&quot; in the sense of &quot;up-and-coming&quot;, &quot;auspicious&quot;; whereas the second phrase with two words means &quot;promising many things&quot;)

==Exceptions ==
* Family names are completely excluded from the rules and are not affected by the reform; this also applies to given names.
* Place names are not strictly subject to the rules. The German &quot;&quot; (Permanent Committee for Geographic Names) strongly recommends applying the rules for &quot;new&quot; names, but stresses that this applies only when new names are assigned or the responsible authorities decide to modify existing names.

==History==

===Debate over the need for reform===
Spelling reform had been discussed for a long time and was still controversial in the late 1960s.

===Institutionalised reform talks since 1980===
In 1980, the (International Working Group for Orthography) was formed, with linguists from East Germany, West Germany, Austria, and Switzerland taking part.

The initial proposals of this working group were further discussed at two conferences in Vienna, Austria, in 1986 and 1990, to which the Austrian government had invited representatives from every region where German is spoken. In the closing remarks from the first of these meetings, capitalisation reform was put off to a future &quot;second phase&quot; of German language reform attempts, since no consensus had been reached.

In 1987, the ministers of education of the federal states () in West Germany assigned the Leibniz Institute for the German Language in Mannheim, Germany, and the Society for the German Language in Wiesbaden, Germany, with the task of coming up with a new system of rules. In 1988, these two organisations presented an incomplete but very wide-ranging set of proposed new rules, for example, the phrase (&quot;The Emperor eats the eel in the boat&quot;) would be written . However, these proposals were quickly rejected by the general public, and then they were withdrawn by the ministers of education as unacceptable. At the same time, similar groups were formed in Switzerland, Austria, and East Germany.

In 1992, the International Working Group published a proposed global reform to German spelling entitled (&quot;German Spelling: Proposals for its New Regulation&quot;). In 1993, the German ministers of education invited 43 groups to present their opinions on the document, with hearings held in the unified Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. On the basis of these hearings, the working group backed off from the notion of eliminating the capitalisation of all nouns. It also preserved the orthographical distinction between the inconvenient homophones (&quot;the&quot;, or &quot;that&quot;, relative pronoun) and (&quot;that&quot;, conjunction, as in &quot;She said that you came&quot;), which introduce different types of subordinate clause.

At a third conference in Vienna in 1994, the results were recommended to the respective governments for acceptance. The German ministers of education decided to implement the new rules on 1 August 1998, with a transitional period lasting until the 2004–2005 school year.

===Institution of the reform===
On 1 July 1996, all of the German states (&#x27;), and the countries of Austria, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, as well as some other countries with German-speaking minorities (but notably not Luxembourg) agreed to introduce the new spelling by 1 August 1998. A few German &#x27; introduced the new rules starting from the 1996–97 school year.

===Public debate after the signing of the declaration of intent===
The reforms did not attract much attention from the general public until after the international declaration of intent was signed. Animated arguments arose about the correctness of the decision, with schoolteachers being the first to be faced with the implementation of the new rules. At the Frankfurt Book Fair (the largest in Germany) in 1996, , a teacher from Bavaria, obtained signatures from hundreds of authors and scientists demanding the cancellation of the reform. Among the leading opponents were , , , , and . The protest gained further nationwide significance through initiatives such as (We Teachers Against the Spelling Reform), which was headed by the teacher and activist .

In May 1997, the &quot;Society for German Spelling and Language Cultivation – initiative against the spelling reform&quot; () was founded in opposition to the German spelling reform.

The issue was taken up in the courts, with different decisions in different German states, so that the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany was called upon to make a ruling. In May 1998, a group of 550 language and literature professors, led by , Helmut Jochems, and , two of the reformers, Harald Weinrich of the , Jean-Marie Zemb of the , and others, in a resolution requested the reversal of the reform by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany.

On 14 July 1998, after one hearing on 12 May 1998, and involving only one teachers&#x27; organisation, the Federal Constitutional Court declared that the introduction of the spelling reform by the ministers of education was lawful.

In the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, a majority of voters in a referendum on 27 September 1998 called for a return to traditional spellings. However, the minister-president of the state, Heide Simonis, found a way to reverse the results of the referendum via a parliamentary vote in 1999.

While the new German dictionaries were published in July and August 1996, the critics of the language reform perceived themselves to be justified. They began to demand the reversal of the change at the federal level. However, the ministers of education continued to refuse to accede to their demands. The editors of the Duden dictionaries also agreed that many of the problems in the traditional spelling system were due to the &quot;arcane rules&quot; that had been fabricated to explain the system, thus lending their support to the new spelling system, which they said was and is more logical.

One of the public critics of the spelling reform was , president of the (German Association of Teachers).

===Later developments===

In 1997, an international committee was formed to handle any cases of doubt that might arise under the new rules. In 2004, the German federal minister of education and research, , announced that this committee was to be given wide-ranging powers to make decisions about German spelling. Only in cases of extreme changes, such as the proposed capitalisation change, would the committee require the consent of the states&#x27; ministers of education. This move was strongly criticised.

Simultaneously, the committee released its fourth report on spelling reforms, reviewing the points of the reform in detail. However, this report was rejected by the Conference of Ministers of Education in March 2004. The ministers also demanded that the committee work together with the German Academy for Language and Poetry in its future deliberations. The academy had been strongly critical of the reform from the beginning. The ministers also made changes to the composition of the international committee. 

In July 2004, the ministers decided to introduce some changes to the reform, making both the traditional and the new spellings acceptable. They also formed a Council for German Orthography, &quot;38 experts from five countries&quot;, representing linguists, publishers, writers, journalists, teachers and parents. Taking the place of the existing international committee, the Council agreed unanimously to implement the uncontroversial parts of the reform, while allowing compromises on other changes: &quot;writing compounds separately or as a single word, [on] the use of lower and upper case, punctuation and syllabification&quot;. This modified reform came into effect by 1 August 2006.

==Legal status==
The spelling change is based on the international agreement of 1 July 1996, signed on behalf of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The signatories for Germany were the president of the Conference of Ministers of Education, Karl-Heinz Reck, and the parliamentary secretary of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Eduard Lintner. There have been no Bundestag (parliamentary) decisions on the reforms. Instead, as mentioned above, the German Supreme Court ruled that the reform in the public schools could be decided by the ministers of education. Thus, as of 1 August 2005, the traditional spelling system was to be considered incorrect in the schools, except that two of the German states, Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia, had both officially rejected the reform. Since 2006, the new rules have become compulsory in Bavarian and North Rhine-Westphalian public schools as well. It is presumed that from the schools the writing reforms will spread to the German-speaking public.

==State of implementation==
, most German printed media used spelling rules that to a large extent comply with the reforms. These included most newspapers and periodicals, and the German press agencies (DPA) and Reuters. Still, some newspapers, including &#x27;, the &#x27;, the &#x27;, and the &#x27;, created their own in-house orthography rules, while most other newspapers used approximately the rules set out by the DPA. These in-house orthographies thus occupy a continuum between &quot;old spelling with new rules for ß&quot; and an (almost) full acceptance of the new rules.

Schoolbooks and children&#x27;s books generally follow the new spellings, while the text of novels is presented as the authors prefer. Classic works of literature are typically printed without any changes, unless they are editions specifically intended for use in schools. 

Since dictionaries adopted the new spellings early on, there is no currently in-print, standard reference work available for traditional spellings. However, , a Professor of German at the University of Erlangen, has produced a new dictionary that aims to meet the demands of simplification without the need to impose any new spellings. It has not been reprinted since 2004. The commerce in used copies of the older Duden dictionaries has dwindled. As of the 2004 edition, the Duden dictionary includes the most recent changes proposed by the ministers of education.

The IETF language tags registered in 2005 for text following the reform.

==Acceptance of the reform==

===In Switzerland and Liechtenstein===
In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the reform had a less noticeable effect, as the letter &quot;ß&quot;, which was a prominent part of the reform, was not in use anyway.

<text>The School of Computer Science (SCS) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US is a school for computer science established in 1988. It has been consistently ranked among the best computer science programs over the decades. As of 2024 U.S. News &amp; World Report ranks the graduate program as tied for No. 1 with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley. 
Researchers from Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science have made fundamental contributions to the fields of algorithms, artificial intelligence, computer networks, distributed systems, parallel processing, programming languages, computational biology, robotics, language technologies, human–computer interaction and software engineering.

==History==
In July 1965, Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Alan J. Perlis, in conjunction with the faculty from the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA, renamed Tepper School of Business in 2004), staff from the newly formed Computation Center, and key administrators created the Computer Science Department, one of the first such departments in the nation. Their mission statement was &quot;to cultivate a course of study leading to the PhD degree in computer science, a program that would exploit the new technology and assist in establishing a discipline of computer science.&quot; The educational program, formally accepted in October 1965, drew its first graduate students from several existing academic disciplines: mathematics, electrical engineering, psychology, and the interdisciplinary Systems and Communications Sciences program in the Graduate School of Industrial Administration. The department was housed within the Mellon College of Science.

With support from Newell, Simon, Nico Haberman, Provost Angel Jordan and President Richard Cyert, the computer science department began a two-year status as a &quot;floating&quot; department in the early months of 1986. Then, the Department began to grow, both academically and financially. In 1988, the School of Computer Science was established, among the first such schools in the country. The Computer Science Department was the original department within the school.

==Structure in the 1970s==
During the 1970s the Computer Science Department offered only a PhD study program, with no master&#x27;s degree as an intermediate step. The PhD program required a minimum of six years of residency. It was called the &quot;do or die&quot; program among the graduate students, because a student could not drop a PhD and receive a master&#x27;s degree. It had quickly focused on computer networking, operating systems (Hydra, Accent, Mach), and robotics.

==SCS today==

===Organizational units===
* Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department (CBD)
* Computer Science Department (CSD)
* Human–Computer Interaction Institute (HCII)
* Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D): Its research and education focus is on software systems, which spans not only classical software engineering but also topics such as economics, social and organizational issues, public policy, and privacy. S3D is a distinct entity from the Software Engineering Institute (SEI). SEI is a FFRDC, which is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense and does not offer educational programs.
* Language Technologies Institute (LTI)
* Machine Learning Department (MLD)
* Robotics Institute (RI)

== Gates and Hillman Centers ==

The Gates Center for Computer Science and the Hillman Center for Future-Generation Technologies are home to much of the School of Computer Science. The $98 million complex was opened in 2009.
It has of floor space, including about 310 offices, 11 conference rooms, 32 labs, of project space and the Planetary Robotics Center. It also houses 12 classrooms, including a 250-seat auditorium.

Additionally, the Gates Center connects to the Purnell Center, which houses the School of Drama, via the Randy Pausch Memorial Footbridge. The bridge represents Professor Pausch&#x27;s own devotion to linking computer science and entertainment, as he was a co-founder of Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s Entertainment Technology Center.

Mack Scogin Merril Elam Architects of Atlanta, Georgia were the lead architects. The Gates and Hillman Centers have received LEED Gold Certification.

== Traditions ==

* Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s Mobot Races, now in their 14th year, are hosted by the School of Computer Science during every Spring Carnival celebration. The Mobots (short for mobile robots) follow a slalom course painted in the sidewalk outside of Wean Hall. The Mobot Races used to include a MoboJoust competition, but it has not been held since 2002 to avoid damaging the Mobots.
* SCS Day is a yearly celebration of computer science that started in 2003. The event features a variety of activities, including exhibits, workshops and games, in addition to an evening talent show.

== Smiley face ==

SCS research professor Scott Fahlman is credited with the invention of the smiley face emoticon. He suggested the emoticon on an electronic board in 1982 as a way for board readers to know when an author was joking. The text of Fahlman&#x27;s original post was lost for nearly 20 years but was later recovered from backup tapes:


== Tartan Racing ==

Tartan Racing is a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and General Motors Corporation that competes in the DARPA Grand Challenge. The Grand Challenge is a competition for driverless cars sponsored by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Tartan Racing is led by Carnegie Mellon roboticist William L. &quot;Red&quot; Whittaker.

In 2007, Tartan Racing won the DARPA Urban Challenge, in which 11 autonomous ground vehicles raced over urban roadways. In the challenge, team vehicles were required to obey all California driving laws, share the road with other drivers and robotic cars, and complete the course in under six hours. Tartan Racing won the $2 million cash prize with Boss, a reworked 2007 Chevy Tahoe. Averaging about an hour for a trip, Boss beat the second-place team, Stanford Racing, by just under 20 minutes.

==SCS honors and awards==

The School established a number of honors and awards.

* SCS Endowed Chairs
* Finmeccanica Chair
* A. Nico Habermann Chair in the School of Computer Science
* Litton Faculty Fellows
* Allen Newell Award for Research Excellence
* Herbert A. Simon Award for Teaching Excellence in Computer Science

<doc id="286591" wikidata="Q336629" url="?curid=286591" title="James Carnegie, 3rd Duke of Fife">
<text>James George Alexander Bannerman Carnegie, 3rd Duke of Fife (23 September 1929 – 22 June 2015) was a British landowner, farmer and peer. He was the grandson of Louise, Princess Royal, a daughter of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. As a female-line great-grandson of a British sovereign, he did not carry out royal or official duties or receive any funds from the Civil List. He was the second cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, and King Harald V of Norway. Through his maternal grandfather, he was also a descendant of William IV and Dorothea Jordan.

==Early life==
The Duke was the only son of the 11th Earl of Southesk (1893–1992) and his wife, Princess Maud (1893–1945), the younger daughter of the 1st Duke of Fife and Louise, Princess Royal. One of his godparents was George V, his mother&#x27;s maternal uncle, who was represented at the christening by his eldest son and heir, the Prince of Wales.

The Duke was educated at Ludgrove, Gordonstoun School, and at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester. He served with the Scots Guards in Malaya in 1948–50. He served as vice patron of the Braemar Royal Highland Society and of the British Olympic Association.

==Duke of Fife==
The Dukedom of Fife was first granted in 1889 to the Duke&#x27;s grandfather, the 6th Earl of Fife, by Queen Victoria on his marriage to Princess Louise of Wales, the eldest daughter of the Prince of Wales. In April 1900, the first Duke received a new patent as Duke of Fife and Earl of Macduff in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, this time with a special remainder to his daughters by Princess Louise and their male issue. As the only surviving children of the Duke and Princess Louise were two daughters, the dukedom passed to Princess Alexandra, who became Princess Arthur of Connaught.

On 26 February 1959, the duke succeeded his maternal aunt, Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife, as Duke of Fife and Earl of Macduff, because her only child, Alastair, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, had predeceased her. On 16 February 1992 the third Duke also succeeded his father as Earl of Southesk and as chief of the Clan Carnegie.

He lived at Elsick House, on his estate near Stonehaven in Kincardineshire and also farmed the family estate around Kinnaird Castle, Brechin. His interests included sports cars, driving a Ford Zephyr 6 in the 1955 Monte Carlo Rally.

==Tsar Nicholas II ==
In the 1990s, Fife&#x27;s mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) was used to help identify bones recovered in Siberia in 1979 as the remains of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, who was killed in 1918 by the Communists along with his wife and children. Queen Alexandra, the Duke of Fife&#x27;s maternal great-grandmother, was the older sister of Nicholas II&#x27;s mother, Dagmar. The test required a female line descendant, as mDNA is passed unchanged from mother to child, unless there is a mutation. In Fife&#x27;s case, mDNA from Queen Alexandra passed to his grandmother, Louise, Princess Royal, and then to his mother, Princess Maud, and then to him. Fife&#x27;s mDNA was a 98.5% match with the bones, a rare imperfect match that scientists suspected was caused by a genetic mutation on the Russian side called a heteroplasmy. In 1994, the remains of Nicholas&#x27;s younger brother, Grand Duke Georgy Alexandrovich, were exhumed in Saint Petersburg. The mDNA from Grand Duke Georgy also revealed the heteroplasmy, confirming the theory of the mutation and conclusive proof that the bones indeed belonged to the last tsar of Russia.

==Marriage and family==

As a young man, the Duke&#x27;s name was variously linked with Princess Margaret, ballerina Mary Drage, and sportswoman Divina Galica.

On 11 September 1956, the then Lord Carnegie married The Hon. Caroline Dewar (born 12 February 1934), the elder daughter of the 3rd Baron Forteviot at St Ninian&#x27;s Cathedral, Perth, Scotland. Guests at the wedding included Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The reception was held at the Dewar family residence, Dupplin Castle.

The marriage produced two children before they divorced in 1966: 
* Lady Alexandra Clare Carnegie (born 20 June 1959), who married Mark Fleming Etherington on 11 May 2001. They have one daughter, Amelia Mary Etherington (born 24 December 2001).
* David Carnegie, 4th Duke of Fife (born 3 March 1961), who married Caroline Anne Bunting on 16 June 1987, and succeeded as the 4th Duke of Fife in 2015. They have three sons, including Charles Duff Carnegie, Earl of Southesk (born 1989), heir to the dukedom.

==Other titles==
In addition to being 3rd Duke of Fife, he was also:
* 12th Earl of Southesk (Peerage of Scotland)
* 3rd Earl of Macduff (Peerage of the United Kingdom)
* 12th Lord Carnegie of Kinnaird (Peerage of Scotland)
* 12th Lord Carnegie, of Kinnaird and Leuchars (Peerage of Scotland)
* 4th Baron Balinhard of Farnell in the County of Forfar (Peerage of the United Kingdom)
* 9th Carnegie Baronet (Baronetage of Nova Scotia)

<text>Maurice-François Garin (; 3 March 1871 – 19 February 1957) was an Italian-French road bicycle racer best known for winning the inaugural Tour de France in 1903, and for being stripped of his title in the second Tour in 1904 along with eight others, for cheating. He was of Italian origin but adopted French nationality on 21 December 1901.

==Family life==
Garin was born the son of Maurice-Clément Garin and Maria Teresa Ozello in Arvier, in the French-speaking Aosta Valley in north-west Italy, close to the French border. The name Garin was the most common in the native village of Maurice, called &quot;Chez-les-Garin&quot;, belonging to five of the seven families. They had four daughters and five sons, of whom Maurice was the first son.

In 1885 the family left Arvier to work on the other side of the Alps, almost to the Belgian border.

Garin worked as a chimney sweep. He later moved to France. By the age of 15, he was living in Reims as a chimney sweep. He moved to Charleroi in Belgium but by 1889 he was back in France, at Maubeuge.

Garin&#x27;s younger brother, Joseph-Isidore, died in 1889. The father died shortly afterwards in Arvier. Garin&#x27;s brothers François and César stayed in northern France and, with Maurice, opened a cycle shop in the lower end of the boulevard de Paris in Roubaix in 1895. Brothers César and Ambroise also competed as professional cyclists.

Garin moved to Lens, Pas-de-Calais in 1902 and lived there the rest of his life. He bought his first bicycle for 405 francs, twice what a forge worker would earn in a week of 12-hour days, in 1889. Racing did not interest him but he did ride round the town fast enough to be called a madman – &quot;le fou&quot;.

Until 2004, it was said that Garin had taken French nationality when he was 21, in 1892 but in 2004, the reporter Franco Cuaz found the naturalizing act and Garin took French nationality 21 December 1901.

==Amateur racing==
He began racing in northern France in the same year when the secretary of the cycling club at Maubeuge persuaded him to enter a regional race, Maubeuge-Hirson-Maubeuge, over 200 km. Garin finished fifth despite suffering from the sun and decided to ride more.

His first win was in 1893, in Namur-Dinant-Givet in Belgium. He had sold his first bike and bought a lighter one – still 16 kg but with pneumatic tyres – for 850 old French francs (approx €3,000 at 2008 values). The race was over 102 km. He was leading by Dinant when he punctured. Spotting a soigneur waiting with a spare bike for a rival, Garin rested his own against the wall of a bridge, grabbed the soigneur&#x27;s spare bike and rode off. At the finish, winning with ten minutes over the field, he gave back the bike and recovered his own the next day where he had left it.

==Professional racing==
Garin became a professional by chance. He planned to ride a race at Avesnes-sur-Helpes, 25 km from where he lived. He arrived to find it was only for professionals. Not allowed to compete, he waited until the riders had left, raced after them and passed them all. He fell off twice but finished ahead of the racers. The crowd was enthusiastic but the organisers less so. They refused to pay him the 150 francs (approx €525 at 2008 values) due to the real winner, so spectators raised 300 francs (approx €1,050 at 2008 values) among themselves. Garin became a professional.

His first true professional win was in a 24-hour race in Paris in 1893. It was held on the Champ de Mars, site of the Eiffel Tower. The riders competed, as was the custom, behind a succession of pacers. The event took place in February and the cold drove out riders one after the other. Garin rode 701 km in 24 hours, beating the only other rider to finish by 49 km. While other riders would consume much strong red wine, Garin chose a more apt diet, and said he had survived on: 

*19L hot chocolate
*7L tea
*mixed champagne/coffee
*5L tapioca
*2kg rice
*45 cutlets
*8 hardboiled eggs
*oysters
In 1894 he won a 24-hour race in Liège, Belgium, and the following year set an hour record for cycling behind pacers.

The first Paris–Roubaix was in 1896; Garin came third, 15 minutes behind Josef Fischer. He would have come second had he not been knocked over by a crash between two tandems, one of them ridden by his pacers. Garin &quot;finished exhausted and Dr Butrille was obliged to attend the man who had been run over by two machines,&quot; said the race historian, Pascal Sergent.

In 1897 he won Paris–Roubaix, beating the Dutchman Mathieu Cordang in the last two kilometres of the velodrome at Roubaix. Sergent said:

As the two champions appeared they were greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome&#x27;s cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.

A classic victory was within his grasp but he could almost feel his adversary&#x27;s breath on his neck. Somehow Garin held on to his lead of two metres, two little metres for a legendary victory. The stands exploded and the ovation united the two men. Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.

In 1898 he won Paris–Roubaix again, this time by 20 minutes, and in 1901 he won the second edition of Paris–Brest–Paris, finishing almost two hours ahead of Gaston Rivierre after covering 1,208 km in 52h 11m 1s. He started by chasing another Frenchman, Lucien Lesna, who rode the first 600 km at 28km/h and had two hours&#x27; lead at Brest. At Rennes he stopped for a bath to recover from the tiredness, filth and heat, then found he could not get racing again into the headwind. Garin passed him at Mayenne and Lesna gave up shortly afterwards with 200 km to go. Garin finished 19h 11m better than Charles Terront ten years earlier.

In 1902 Garin won Bordeaux–Paris, a race of 500 km from south-west France.

==Tour de France==

===1903 Tour de France===

The Tour de France began to promote a new daily sports newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; ahead of the largest paper in France, &quot;Le Vélo&quot;, which sold 80,000 copies a day. Some of &quot;Le Vélo&quot;″s advertisers had disagreed with the paper&#x27;s support for Alfred Dreyfus, a soldier found guilty on trumped up charges of selling secrets to the Germans but eventually acquitted after being sent to Devil&#x27;s Island. The Tour was to promote their new rival paper, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;.

The editor, Henri Desgrange, planned a five-week race from 31 May to 5 July. This proved too daunting and only 15 entered. Desgrange cut the length to 19 days and offered a daily allowance.

The race began at the Au Reveil Matin café at a crossroads in Montgeron, south of Paris, and ended in Ville-d&#x27;Avray, another suburb, having circuited France in six days of racing over 2,428 km. One stage, between Nantes and Paris, was 471 km. Sixty riders started at an entry fee of 10 francs – €87.50 today with inflation – and 21 finished. Garin won 3,000 francs (approx €10,500 at 2008 values) for finishing first in 94h 33m 14s, or 6,125 francs (approx €21,500 at 2008 values) in all with his other prizes. Lucien Pothier was second and Fernand Augereau third.

Pierre Chany wrote:
In the town which adopted Maurice Garin, at Lens, an immense procession was organised with the participation of all the notables of the region. Before leaving Paris on Monday evening, the day after the race finished, the winner paid a visit, out of politeness, to Henri Desgrange and, in a gesture without precedent, pulled a sheet of paper from his pocket. It was an article &#x27;in order to simplify the interview&#x27;, he explained! There he gave his feelings during the race, gave his opinion on the formula by which the race was run, gave a word of congratulation to his rivals.

Garin&#x27;s written note said:

===1904 Tour de France===

Garin also won the 1904 Tour de France, by a small margin over Lucien Pothier, but was subsequently stripped of the title which was awarded to Henri Cornet. The race aroused a passion among spectators, who felled trees to hold back rivals and beat up others at night outside St-Étienne. Garin was one of the mob&#x27;s victims. Pierre Chany wrote:

In the climb of the col de la République, leaving St-Étienne, supporters of the regional rider, Faure, assault the Italian, Gerbi. He is thrown to the ground, beaten like plaster. He escapes with a broken finger...

... A bunch of fanatics wielded sticks and shouted insults, setting on the other riders: Maurice and César Garin got a succession of blows, the older brother [Maurice] was hit in the face with a stone. Soon there was general mayhem: &quot;Up with Faure! Down with Garin! Kill them!&quot; they were shouting. Finally cars arrived and the riders could get going thanks to pistol shots. The aggressors disappeared into the night.

Garin said: &quot;I&#x27;ll win the Tour de France provided I&#x27;m not murdered before we get to Paris.&quot;

Misbehaviour was rife too between riders and nine were thrown out during the race for, among other things, riding in or being pulled by cars. There were claims, too, that the organisers had allowed Garin to break rules – at one stage being given food where it was not permitted by its chief official – because his sponsor, La Française, had a financial stake in the race.

The French cycling union, the Union Vélocipédique Française, heard from dozens of competitors and witnesses and in December disqualified all the stage winners and the first four finishers: Garin, Pothier, César Garin, and Hippolyte Aucouturier. The UVF did not say precisely what had happened and the details were lost when Tour archives were transported south in 1940 to avoid the German invasion and never seen again. Stories spread of riders spreading tacks on the road to delay rivals with punctures, of riders being poisoned by each other or by rival fans. Lucien Petit-Breton said he complained to an official that he had seen a rival hanging on to a motorcycle, only to have the cheating rider pull out a revolver.

Tales were also said to include &#x27;Garin taking a train&#x27;, a claim confirmed by a cemetery attendant looking after his grave who, as a boy, heard Garin tell his stories as an old man. In December 1904 Garin was stripped of his title and banned for two years.

==Retirement==
Garin retired from cycling and ran his garage in Lens until his death. The garage is still there, although wholly changed from Garin&#x27;s era. An unnamed writer recalled:

I remember Maurice Garin well. I met him and talked to him almost every day because we lived in the same area, 200 m from each other, at Lens. &quot;Le Père Garin&quot;, as my father and grandfather called him used to bring out a chair in fine weather and sit in the doorway of the little office of the service station he owned at 116 rue de Lille in Lens, under the sign for Antar fuel and oil. My barber was in the neighbouring house and I used to go there once a month to have a crew cut, [&quot;couper en brosse&quot;] which was the fashion in those days. My friends and I were aged seven to ten and on our one-speed bikes we used to pin numbers on our back... and we never missed riding past Maurice Garin in a tight group so that he would see. It&#x27;s strange that nobody thought to take a picture of me, the little kid, alongside the first great champion of the biggest race in the world. But life&#x27;s like that.

Maurice Garin was far from an adulated hero, even less a rich champion (he spent his retirement running the service station), and I don&#x27;t remember any special celebration in his honour. Television crews didn&#x27;t come from home and abroad to interview him. [They showed no interest] until he died in 1957. And the rue de Lille, where he lived, still hasn&#x27;t been renamed the rue Maurice Garin.

Garin kept his interest in cycling. He returned just once to his birthplace, in 1949, to see the Tour pass through. He began a professional team under his name after the Second World War. The Dutchman Piet van Est won Bordeaux–Paris in 1950 and 1952 in the team&#x27;s red and white jersey. On the Tour&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 1953, Garin was among several old stars waiting at the finish as part of a celebration.

==Death and commemoration==

In 1933 the Stade Vélodrome Maurice Garin was built in Lens, and named in his honour.

In 1938 Garin was awarded the gold medal of Physical Education by the Minister of Sport for France, Leo Lagrange.

Garin is remembered as a short, determined man, even authoritarian. As an old man he became confused. His biographer, Franco Cuaz, said:
... He [Garin] wandered through Lens asking &quot;Where is the control? Where is the control?&quot; as his mind brought back images of the hotels where riders signed check sheets in the first Tours.

 ... He regularly ended up at the town&#x27;s police station, from where he was escorted back home. Often he was far from home, without knowing where he was or where he was going.

In 2003 a street was named after him in Maubeuge on the 100th anniversary of his 1903 win in the Tour de France.

In 2004 &quot;Les Amis de Paris–Roubaix&quot; placed a cobblestone on his grave, a traditional trophy for winners of the Paris–Roubaix race.

In Arvier, the village in Italy where he was born, there is a monument in his honour. His biographer, Franco Cuaz, said: &quot;Every year, the municipality sends me French people who want to see the house where he was born. It&#x27;s like a pilgrimage.&quot;

<doc id="286600" wikidata="Q1464542" url="?curid=286600" title="Friends General Conference">
<text>Friends General Conference (FGC) is an association of Quakers in the United States and Canada made up of 16 yearly meetings and 12 autonomous monthly meetings. &quot;Monthly meetings&quot; are what Quakers call congregations; &quot;yearly meetings&quot; are organizations of monthly meetings within a geographic region. FGC was founded in 1900.

FGC-affiliated meetings are typically in the &quot;unprogrammed&quot; Quaker tradition, though there are some Friends churches with pastors. &quot;Unprogrammed&quot; means that worship is based on silent waiting for the Spirit&#x27;s inspiration, without a pastor or a prepared order of worship. As of 2022, there are approximately 32,000 members in over 650 congregations (called meetings or churches).

Friends (Quakers) affiliated with FGC tend to be theologically liberal and more socially progressive than Friends in other branches of Quakerism in North America, though FGC welcomes Friends with diverse experiences and points of view. 

FGC&#x27;s programs include an annual week-long conference called &quot;The Gathering,&quot; on-line retreats and worship opportunities, resources for meetings in becoming anti-racist spiritual communities, spiritual mentorship for youth and young adults, book publishing and sales, religious education materials, interfaith relations, and websites for meetings. 

Along with the Friends United Meeting, the FGC is a member of the interdenominational World Council of Churches. The Philadelphia Yearly Meeting (PYM) is primarily affiliated with the FGC and the main offices are located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

==History==

FGC&#x27;s history can be traced back to conferences held by several Quaker organizations between 1868 and 1900, including the First Day School Conference, the Friends Union for Philanthropic Labor, the Friends Religious Conference, the Friends Educational Conference, and the Young Friends Association. These groups officially joined together as Friends General Conference at Chautauqua, New York, in August 1900.

FGC has held a conference either every year or every other year, usually at a different college each time, simply called Friends General Conference (FGC). In the late 1970s in order to make a distinction between FGC as an organization and the annual conference, the conference began to be called the Gathering. In recent years, the Gathering has been held several times on the west coast rather than the East or Midwest. 

==Structure and governance==
As of May 2022, the governing body for FGC is a Central Committee made up of 111 Friends, 54 of whom are appointed by affiliated yearly and monthly meetings. It meets once a year in the fall, usually October. There is also an Executive Committee made up of officers, clerks of sub-committees, yearly meeting representatives, and at-large members which meets three times a year. 

Central Committee is uniquely responsible for:
*Making final policy decisions affecting the Friends General Conference organization and program
*Approving the annual budget
*Making changes in the corporate by-laws

Executive Committee can make any decisions other than these to keep the organization functioning throughout the year.

The work of FGC is carried out by staff and several hundred volunteers. It is managed by a General Secretary (similar to an Executive Director) who provides spiritually grounded leadership, adhering to the vision statement, minute of purpose, and objectives determined by Central Committee.

In 2021, FGC had a budget of US$1.6 million and assets of US $6,241,856.

==The Gathering==
A key program of FGC is the annual Gathering for all ages, traditionally held at a different college every July. Before the pandemic, the event attracted between 800 and 1,500 attenders from around the world, with most participants coming from the United States and Canada. During the height of the pandemic, 2020 through 2022, it was held virtually. Starting in 2023 a hybrid Gathering was implemented. The event features 40–60 mostly week-long workshops and a slate of both Quaker and non-Quaker plenary speakers. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. offered a plenary presentation in 1958. In addition to workshops and plenary sessions, the Gathering features concerts for all ages. Renowned folk singer Pete Seeger performed in 1997. There are programs for children, youth, and young adults.

Since the 1990s the Friends General Conference annual gathering has implemented a unique golf cart transit system on campus. Volunteer cart drivers will drive anyone with mobility impairment anywhere on campus between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. each day of the conference, plus limited after-hours midnight movie runs and 6:00 a.m. shuttle connection runs as needed. Staffers are to answer the dedicated Golf Cart Central cell phone and then dispatch volunteer drivers at all hours between 7:00 and 10:00. All priority riders take a card with the Central phone number, so that if they ever try to walk 1/2 mile but it turns out that they only can walk 1/4 mile that day, they can call for a ride. Cart drivers may also move parents dropping off their children at children&#x27;s programs, travelers moving their luggage to or from shuttle buses and then they can move anybody else, because certain people&#x27;s mobility can change on an excessively hot and humid afternoon. Drivers are trained to never judge whether someone is able-bodied just because they are not visibly disabled. Volunteer golf cart driver training takes about one hour. Safety and diplomacy are emphasized. Typically 30 volunteer drivers, six dispatcher shifts per day and six to eight golf carts combine to move up to 100 priority riders around campus.

<doc id="286601" wikidata="Q6902562" url="?curid=286601" title="Monsieur Zenith">
<text>Monsieur Zenith the Albino is a fictional character who appeared as a recurring antagonist in the Sexton Blake detective series. Created by writer Anthony Skene in 1919, Zenith became one of Blake&#x27;s most notable and popular adversaries. Originally Romanian nobility living in exile, he is characterized by his albinism, world-weary demeanor, and gentleman thief persona.

Immediately recognizable by his crimson-colored eyes and white hair, Zenith is portrayed as an aristocratic criminal who operates with a strict code of honor. His character is distinguished by his formal attire, typically appearing in evening dress, and his habit of smoking opium-laced cigarettes. One of these cigarettes, marked with a crimson ring, is described as containing a lethal dose, which Zenith keeps as a last resort to avoid imprisonment.

Unlike many traditional antagonists, Zenith&#x27;s motivation stems not from greed but from a profound ennui that can only be relieved through opium, danger, and adventure. His relationship with Sexton Blake is marked by sportsmanship rather than animosity, treating their encounters as an intellectual game. The character&#x27;s background is deliberately shrouded in mystery, though he is often referred to as &quot;Excellency&quot; and wears foreign orders of distinction.

==Literary influence and legacy==
Zenith&#x27;s character, influenced by the anti-heroes of Gothic fiction and master villains like Fantômas, went on to inspire other literary works. Most notably, he was an important influence in Michael Moorcock&#x27;s creation of the fantasy character Elric of Melniboné. Moorcock later wrote an introduction to the re-publication of Skene&#x27;s novel, &quot;Monsieur Zenith: The Albino&quot; (ISBN ), and incorporated the character into his own work &quot;The Metatemporal Detective&quot;.

==Modern revival==
In 2012, Obverse Books published &quot;Zenith Lives!: Tales of M.Zenith, the Albino&quot;, a collection of Zenith short stories edited by Stuart Douglas. The anthology, Book 4 of &quot;The Obverse Quarterly&quot;, featured contributions from several authors: Stuart Douglas, Sexton Blake scholar Mark Hodder, Paul Magrs, George Mann (a story set in his steampunk universe which also features a crossover character from Mann&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel, &quot;Paradox Lost&quot;), and Michael Moorcock (featuring Seaton Begg, an alternate version of Sexton Blake).

<text>Jim Corbett National Park is a national park in India located in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand state. The first national park in India, it was established in 1936 during the British Raj and named &quot;Hailey National Park&quot; after William Malcolm Hailey, a governor of the United Provinces in which it was then located. In 1956, nearly a decade after India&#x27;s independence, it was renamed &quot;Corbett National Park&quot; after the hunter and naturalist Jim Corbett, who had played a leading role in its establishment and had died the year before. The park was the first to come under the Project Tiger initiative.

Corbett National Park comprises area of hills, riverine belts, marshy depressions, grasslands and a large lake. The elevation ranges from . Winter nights are cold but the days are bright and sunny. It rains from July to September. The park has sub-Himalayan belt geographical and ecological characteristics. Dense moist deciduous forest mainly consists of &quot;Shorea robusta&quot; (the sal tree), haldu, peepal, rohini and mango trees. Forest covers almost 73 per cent of the park, while 10 per cent of the area consists of grasslands. It houses around 110 tree species, 50 species of mammals, 580 bird species and 25 reptile species.

An ecotourism destination, the park contains 617 different species of plants and a diverse variety of fauna. The increase in tourist activities, among other problems, continues to present a serious challenge to the park&#x27;s ecological balance.

==History==
Some areas of the park were formerly part of the princely state of Tehri Garhwal. The forests were cleared by the Uttarakhand Forest Department to make the area less vulnerable to Rohilla invaders. The Raja of Tehri formally ceded a part of his princely state to the East India Company in return for their assistance in ousting the Gurkhas from his domain. The Buksas—a tribe from the Terai—settled on the land and began growing crops, but in the early 1860s they were evicted with the advent of British rule.

Efforts to save the forests of the region began in the 19th century under Major Ramsay, the British officer who was in-charge of the area during those times. The first step in the protection of the area began in 1868 when the British forest department established control over the land and prohibited cultivation and the operation of cattle stations. In 1879 these forests were constituted into a reserve forest where restricted felling was permitted.

In the early 1900s, several , including E. R. Stevans and E. A. Smythies, suggested the setting up of a national park on this soil. The British administration considered the possibility of creating a game reserve there in 1907. It was only in the 1930s that the process of demarcation for such an area got underway. A reserve area known as &quot;Hailey National Park&quot; covering was created in 1936, when Sir Malcolm Hailey was the Governor of United Provinces, and Asia&#x27;s first national park came into existence. Hunting was not allowed in the reserve, only timber cutting for domestic purposes was permitted. Soon after the establishment of the reserve, rules prohibiting the killing and capture of mammals, reptiles and birds within its boundaries were passed.

The reserve was renamed &quot;Ramganga National Park&quot; in 1954–1955 and was again renamed in 1955–1956 to Corbett National Park after author and naturalist Jim Corbett.
The park fared well during the 1930s under an elected administration. But during the Second World War, it suffered from excessive poaching and timber cutting. Over time, the area in the reserve was increased to were added in 1991 as a buffer zone to the Corbett Tiger Reserve. The 1991 addition included the entire Kalagarh forest division, assimilating the area of Sonanadi Wildlife Sanctuary as a part of the Kalagarh division. It was chosen in 1974 as the location for launching the Project Tiger wildlife conservation project. The reserve is administered from its headquarters in the Nainital district.

Corbett National Park is one of the thirteen protected areas covered by the World Wide Fund For Nature under their Terai Arc Landscape Program. The program aims to protect three of the five terrestrial flagship species, the tiger, the Asian elephant and the Indian rhinoceros by restoring wildlife corridors to link 13 protected areas of Nepal and India and to enable wildlife .

== Geography ==

Jim Corbett National Park is located partly along Doon Valley between the Lesser Himalaya in the north and the Siwalik Hills in the south; it has a sub-Himalayan belt structure. The upper tertiary rocks are exposed towards the base of the Shiwalik range and hard sandstone units form broad ridges. Characteristic longitudinal valleys, geographically termed &quot;Doons,&quot; or &quot;Duns&quot; can be seen formed along the narrow tectonic zones between lineaments. The elevation of the region ranges between and . It has numerous ravines, ridges, minor streams and small plateaus with varying aspects and degrees of slope. The park encompasses the &quot;Patli Dun&quot; valley formed by the river Ramganga.
Its present area is including a core zone and of buffer area.

=== Climate ===

The weather in the park is temperate compared to most other protected areas of India. The temperature may vary from to during the winter and some mornings are foggy. Summer temperatures normally do not rise above . Rainfall ranges from light during the winter to heavy during the monsoonal summer.

== Flora ==

Tree density inside the reserve is higher in the areas of &quot;Sal&quot; forests and lowest in the &quot;Anogeissus&quot;–&quot;Acacia catechu&quot; forests. Total tree basal cover is greater in Sal dominated areas of woody vegetation. Healthy regeneration in sapling and seedling layers is occurring in the &quot;Mallotus philippensis&quot;, &quot;Jamun&quot; and &quot;Diospyros&quot; spp. communities, but in the Sal forests the regeneration of sapling and seedling is poor. A research survey in the 1970s recorded 488 different plant species; in 2023, 617 species were noted, including 110 tree species. A profile of the reserve compiled by the Wildlife Institute of India, listed the sal tree (&quot;Shorea robusta&quot;), &quot;Adina cordifolia&quot;, &quot;Anogeissus latifolia&quot;, &quot;Bauhinia rausinosa&quot;, &quot;Cassia fistula&quot;, and &quot;M. philippensis&quot; as the notable tree species.

== Fauna ==

More than 586 species of resident and migratory birds have been sighted, including the crested serpent eagle, blossom-headed parakeet and the red junglefowl, owls and nightjars. 33 reptiles species including the Indian python, 7 amphibians species, 7 fish species and 36 dragonflies species have also been recorded.

Mammals are represented by the Indian elephant, Indian leopard, Bengal tiger, jungle cat, fishing cat and leopard cat. barking deer, sambar deer, hog deer and chital, sloth bear and Asiatic black bear, Indian gray mongoose, otters, yellow-throated marten, Himalayan goral, Indian pangolin, langur and rhesus macaque. Marsh crocodiles and gharials were released into Ramganga river.
Thick jungle, the Ramganga river and plentiful prey make this reserve an ideal habitat for predators. According to the 2022 census, there were 260 tigers in the park. There were around 1100 elephants in the park in 2019. The tigers in the park kill large animals like elephants, especially calves.

== Ecotourism ==

Though the main focus is protection of wildlife, the reserve management has also encouraged ecotourism. In 1993, a training course covering natural history, visitor management and park interpretation was introduced to train nature guides. A second course followed in 1995 which recruited more guides for the same purpose. This allowed the staff of the reserve, previously preoccupied with guiding the visitors, to carry out management activities uninterrupted. 

The Indian government has organised workshops on ecotourism in Corbett National Park and Garhwal region to ensure that the local citizens profit from tourism while the park remains protected. According to Riley &amp; Riley (2005): &quot;Best chances of seeing a tiger to come late in the dry season- April to mid-June-and go out with mahouts and elephants for several days.&quot;

As early as 1991, the Corbett National Park played host to 3237 tourist vehicles carrying 45,215 visitors during the main tourist seasons between 15 November and 15 June. This heavy influx of tourists has led to visible stress signs on the natural ecosystem. Excessive trampling of soil has led to reduction in plant species and resulted in reduced soil moisture. Tourists have increasingly used fuel wood for cooking. This fuel wood is obtained from nearby forests resulting in greater pressure on the ecosystem. Additionally, tourists have also reportedly caused problems by making noise, littering, and causing disturbances in general.

==Other attractions==
*Dhikala is situated at the fringes of Patli Dun valley. There is a rest house, which was built hundred of years ago. Kanda ridge forms the backdrop, and from Dhikala, there are views of the valley.
*Kalagarh Dam is located in the south-west of the wildlife sanctuary. Many migratory waterfowl come here in the winters.
*Corbett Falls is a water fall situated from Ramnagar, and from Kaladhungi, on the Kaladhungi–Ramnagar highway. The falls are surrounded by dense forests.
*Garjiya Devi Temple is sacred to Garjiya Devi and is mostly visited during the Kartik Purnima (November – December). It is located on the bank of the river Kosi, amidst the hilly terrains of Uttarakhand, nearby Garjiya village, at a distance of 14 km. from Ramnagar, Uttarakhand, India.

== Challenges ==
=== Past ===

A major incident in the history of the reserve followed the construction of a dam at the Kalagarh river and the submerging of of prime low lying riverine area. The consequences ranged from local extinction of swamp deer to a massive reduction in hog deer population. The reservoir formed due to the submerging of land has also led to an increase in aquatic fauna and has additionally served as a habitat for winter migrants.

Two villages situated on the southern boundary were shifted to the Firozpur–Manpur area situated on Ramnagar–Kashipur highway during 1990–93; the vacated areas were designated as buffer zones. The families in these villages were mostly dependent on forest products. With the passage of time, these areas began to show signs of ecological recovery. Vines, herbs, grasses and small trees began to appear, followed by herbaceous flora, eventually leading to natural forest type. It was observed that grass began to grow on the vacated agricultural fields and the adjoining forest areas started recuperating. By 1999–2002 several plant species emerged in these buffer zones. The newly arisen lush green fields attracted grass eating animals, mainly deer and elephants, who slowly migrated towards these areas and even remained during the monsoon.

There were 109 cases of poaching recorded in 1988–89. This figure dropped to 12 reported cases in 1997–98.

In 1985, David Hunt, a British ornithologist and birdwatching tour guide, was killed by a tiger in the park.

=== Present ===
The reserve habitat faces threats from invasive species such as the exotic weeds &quot;Lantana&quot;, &quot;Parthenium&quot; and &quot;Cassia&quot;. Natural resources like trees and grasses are exploited by the local population while encroachment of at least of by 74 families has been recorded.

The villages surrounding the park are at least 15–20 years old and no new villages have come up in the recent past. The increasing population growth rate and the density of population within to from the park present a challenge to the management of the reserve. Incidents of killing cattle by tigers and leopards have led to acts of retaliation by the local population in some cases. The Indian government has approved the construction of a stone masonry wall on the southern boundary of the reserve where it comes in direct contact with agricultural fields.

In April 2008, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) expressed serious concern that protection systems have weakened, and poachers have infiltrated into this park. Monitoring of wild animals in the prescribed format has not been followed despite advisories and observations made during field visits. Also, the monthly monitoring report of field evidence relating to tigers has not been received since 2006. NTCA said that in the &quot;absence of ongoing monitoring protocol in a standardised manner, it would be impossible to forecast and keep track of untoward happenings in the area targeted by poachers.&quot; A cement road has been built through the park against a Supreme Court order. The road has become a thoroughfare between Kalagarh and Ramnagar. Constantly increasing vehicle traffic on this road is affecting the wildlife of crucial ranges like Jhirna, Kotirau and Dhara. The Kalagarh irrigation colony that takes up about of the park is yet to be vacated despite a 2007 Supreme Court order.

=== Ecosystem valuation ===
An economic assessment study of Jim Corbett Tiger Reserve estimated its annual flow benefits to be ₹14.7 billion (1.14 lakh / hectare). Important ecosystem services included gene-pool protection (₹10.65 billion), provisioning of water to downstream districts of Uttar Pradesh (₹1.61 billion), water purification services to the city of New Delhi (₹550 million), employment for local communities (₹82 million), provision of habitat and refugia for wildlife (₹274 million) and sequestration of carbon (₹214 million).
==In popular culture==
The 2005 Bollywood movie &quot;Kaal&quot; has a plot set in the Jim Corbett National Park. The movie was filmed at the park as well.

In August 2019, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi appeared in a special episode of Discovery Channel&#x27;s show &quot;Man vs Wild&quot; with the host Bear Grylls, where he trekked the jungles and talked about nature and wildlife conservation with Grylls. The episode was filmed in Jim Corbett National Park and broadcast in 180 countries along India.

<text>James Franklin Jeffrey (born February 8, 1946) is an American diplomat who served most recently as the United States Special Representative for Syria Engagement and the Special Envoy to the International military intervention against ISIL.

He has held senior assignments in Washington, D.C., and abroad, including as United States Ambassador to Iraq (2010–2012); United States Ambassador to Turkey (2008–2010); Deputy National Security Advisor (2007–2008); and United States Ambassador to Albania (2002–2004). In 2010 Jeffrey was appointed to the highest rank in the U.S. Foreign Service, Career Ambassador. From 1969 to 1976, Jeffrey was a U.S. Army infantry officer, with service in Germany and Vietnam.

Jeffrey is a visiting fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a member of the CIA External Advisory Board, a member of the American Council on Germany, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He serves on the advisory board for America Abroad Media. He is a frequent commentator on broader foreign policy, national security, and economic trends.

==Early life and education==
Jeffrey was born in Saugus, Massachusetts, in 1946. He received a BA in History from Northeastern University in 1969, and an MBA from Boston University Graduate School of Management in 1977. Jeffrey also holds a diploma in the French language from the University of Paris. In addition to his native English, he speaks German, Turkish, and French.

==Career==
===European security affairs===
Jeffrey joined the US Foreign Service in 1977. After a training assignment in Tunis, Tunisia he was posted to Sofia, Bulgaria, where he served as the on-site U.S. representative during a hijacking of a Turkish Air Flight with five U.S. businessmen taken as hostages, in May 1981. Jeffrey then served on assignments in Adana and Ankara, Turkey as a political-military officer, from 1983 to 1987.

Jeffrey served in Munich, Germany, during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany, from 1989 to 1991, including as acting principal officer during the first Gulf War, and liaison to Radio Free Europe. He then was selected as the US State Department&#x27;s coordinator for the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (now OSCE). Jeffrey later served as the Deputy Presidential Special Advisor for Bosnia Implementation, working to put into place the Dayton Accords.

===Middle East affairs===

In 1996 Jeffrey was selected as Deputy Chief of Mission to the American Embassy Kuwait, and served during Operation Desert Fox and the evacuation of Embassy Kuwait. In 1999 he returned to Turkey, as Deputy Chief of Mission. After serving as Ambassador to Albania from 2002 to 2004, he was selected by Secretary of State Colin Powell and Ambassador John Negroponte to bridge the transition from the Coalition Provisional Authority to the new U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, and subsequently served as Deputy Chief of Mission from 2004 to 2005. He served as Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in Baghdad before returning to Washington to serve as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice’s Special Advisor for Iraq from 2006 to 2007. Jeffrey then served as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, covering broader Middle East policy matters, including co-chairing the Interagency Iran Policy Group.

President George W. Bush nominated Jeffrey as Ambassador to Turkey in 2008, where he served in his fourth and final assignment to Turkey until 2010. President Barack Obama nominated him to serve as Ambassador to Iraq in 2010. Jeffrey oversaw its expansion into the largest Embassy in the world with almost 16,000 employees and an annual budget of over $6 billion, and worked with the U.S. military to ensure a successful transition to a civilian lead. According to Voice of America, after this successful transition, Iraq is now increasingly coming under the control of Iran.

===Deputy National Security Adviser===
In the summer of 2007, Jeffrey was selected to serve on detail to the White House as Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Adviser for President George W. Bush, serving as acting National Security Adviser on Bush&#x27;s 2007 and 2008 trips to the Pacific nations.

===Trump administration===
Jeffrey was amongst 50 Republican national security officials who in August 2016 signed a letter stating Donald Trump was not &quot;qualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief&quot; and &quot;would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being&quot;, so would not be voting for him.

Nevertheless, in 2018 the Trump administration appointed Jeffrey United States Special Representative for Syria Engagement and in 2019 also Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Since assuming the posts he often visited Turkey to discuss the events relating to the Syrian Civil War, and also supported the presence of Turkish forces in Idlib.

In a 2020 interview, Jeffrey acknowledged that he and other officials misled senior Trump administration officials over the number of troops in Syria.

==Recognition==
 Jeffrey has received the Secretary of State&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award on two occasions, in 2010 and 2012, as well as the Secretary of State&#x27;s Career Service Award in 2012, and the Distinguished Honor Award in 2005. Secretary Leon Panetta presented him with the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Civilian Service in 2011, and CIA Director David Petraeus awarded Jeffrey the Director&#x27;s Medal in 2012. He received Boston University&#x27;s School of Management Award for Distinguished Service in 2006, and the American Bar Association&#x27;s Award for Promoting Rule of Law Worldwide in 2004. His military awards include the Bronze Star.

== Personal life ==
Jeffrey is married, has two children, and is a resident of Virginia.

<doc id="286619" wikidata="Q456040" url="?curid=286619" title="Amazon Canada First Novel Award">
<text>The Amazon Canada First Novel Award, formerly the Amazon.ca First Novel Award and the Books in Canada First Novel Award, is a Canadian literary award, co-presented by Amazon.ca and &quot;The Walrus&quot; to the best first novel in English published the previous year by a citizen or resident of Canada. It has been awarded since 1976.

The First Novel Award was founded by the literary magazine &quot;Books in Canada&quot;. Between 1976 and 1994, the award was sponsored by SmithBooks. During this period, the award was known as the SmithBooks/Books in Canada First Novel Award. When SmithBooks was acquired by Chapters, it became the Chapters/&quot;Books in Canada&quot; First Novel Award.

The award was reorganized when &quot;Books in Canada&quot; was acquired by Adrian and Olga Stein in 1995. The Steins retained a first novel editor, introduced a comprehensive first novel review program, and formalized the adjudication process.

Amazon first signed on as a sponsor of the award in 2001, with the award presented as the amazon.ca/Books in Canada First Novel Award through the 2000s. Full administration of the award was taken over by Amazon in 2009 and its name was changed to the Amazon.ca First Novel Award. The Amazon.com arrangement saw the prize award initially doubled to $10,000, and then increased to its current amount of $40,000, with shortlisted finalists each receiving over $6,000.

<doc id="286620" wikidata="Q912381" url="?curid=286620" title="Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton">
<text>James Brian Edward Hutton, Baron Hutton, PC (29 June 1932 – 14 July 2020) was a British Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland and Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.

==Background==
Hutton was born in Belfast in 1932, the son of a railways executive. He won a scholarship to Shrewsbury School and Balliol College, Oxford (BA jurisprudence, 1953) before returning to Belfast to become a barrister (after study at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast), being called to the Bar of Northern Ireland in 1954. He began working as junior counsel to the Attorney General for Northern Ireland in 1969.

He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1970. From 1979 to 1989, he was (as Sir Brian Hutton) a High Court judge. In 1989, he became Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, becoming a member of the Privy Council, before moving to England to become a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary 6 January 1997. He was consequently granted a life peerage as Baron Hutton, of Bresagh in the County of Down.

==Judge==

On 30 March 1994, as Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, he dismissed Private Lee Clegg&#x27;s appeal against his controversial murder conviction. On 21 March 2002 Lord Hutton was one of four Law Lords to reject David Shayler&#x27;s application to use a &quot;public interest&quot; defence as defined in section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989 at his trial.

Lord Hutton represented the Ministry of Defence at the inquest into the killing of 14 civil rights marchers on Bloody Sunday. Later, he publicly reprimanded Major Hubert O&#x27;Neil, the coroner presiding over the inquest, when O&#x27;Neil accused the soldiers who opened fire during the incident of murder, as this contradicted the findings of the Widgery Tribunal.

Hutton also came to public attention in 1999 during the extradition proceedings of former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet. Pinochet had been arrested in London on torture allegations by request of a Spanish judge. Five Law Lords, the UK&#x27;s highest court, decided by a 3–2 majority that Pinochet was to be extradited to Spain. The verdict was then overturned by a panel of seven Law Lords, including Lord Hutton on the grounds that Lord Hoffmann, one of the five Law Lords, had links to human rights group Amnesty International which had campaigned for Pinochet&#x27;s extradition.

In 1978, he defended the UK at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in the case of &quot;Ireland v United Kingdom&quot;, when the ECHR decided that the five techniques used in Northern Ireland were &quot;inhuman and degrading&quot; and breached the European Convention on Human Rights, but did not amount to torture. The ECHR also found that the practice of internment in Northern Ireland had not breached the convention. He sentenced 10 men to 1,001 years in prison on the word of &quot;supergrass&quot; informer Robert Quigley, who was granted immunity in 1984.

Lord Hutton was appointed by Tony Blair&#x27;s government to chair the inquiry on the circumstances surrounding the death of scientist David Kelly. The inquiry commenced on 11 August 2003. Many observers were surprised when he delivered his report on 28 January 2004 and cleared the British government in large part. His criticism of the BBC was regarded by some as unduly harsh; one critic commented that he had given the &quot;benefit of judgement to virtually everyone in the government and no-one in the BBC.&quot;. In response to the verdict, the front page of &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper consisted of one word, &quot;Whitewash?&quot;

Peter Oborne wrote in &quot;The Spectator&quot; in January 2004: &quot;Legal opinion in Northern Ireland, where Lord Hutton practised for most of his career, emphasises the caution of his judgments. He is said to have been habitually chary of making precedents. But few people seriously doubt Hutton&#x27;s fairness or independence. Though [he is] a dour Presbyterian, there were spectacular acquittals of some very grisly IRA terrorist suspects when he was a judge in the Diplock era.&quot;

Lord Hutton retired as a Law Lord on 11 January 2004. He remained a member of the House of Lords until retiring under the House of Lords Reform Act 2014 on 23 April 2018.

He died on 14 July 2020 at the age of 88.

<doc id="286621" wikidata="Q376346" url="?curid=286621" title="Web colors">
<text>Web colors are colors used in displaying web pages on the World Wide Web; they can be described by way of three methods: a color may be specified as an RGB triplet, in hexadecimal format (a &quot;hex triplet&quot;) or according to its common English name in some cases. A color tool or other graphics software is often used to generate color values. In some uses, hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a leading number sign (#). A color is specified according to the intensity of its red, green and blue components, each represented by eight bits. Thus, there are 24 bits used to specify a web color within the sRGB gamut, and 16,777,216 colors that may be so specified.

Colors outside the sRGB gamut can be specified in Cascading Style Sheets by making one or more of the red, green and blue components negative or greater than 100%, so the color space is theoretically an unbounded extrapolation of sRGB similar to scRGB. Specifying a non-sRGB color this way requires the codice_1 function call. It is impossible with the hexadecimal syntax (and thus impossible in legacy HTML documents that do not use CSS).

The first versions of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X11 color names as the basis for their color lists, as both started as X Window System applications.
Web colors have an unambiguous colorimetric definition, sRGB, which relates the chromaticities of a particular phosphor set, a given transfer curve, adaptive whitepoint, and viewing conditions. These have been chosen to be similar to many real-world monitors and viewing conditions, to allow rendering to be fairly close to the specified values even without color management. User agents vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors. More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity; this is particularly important for Web-to-print applications.

== Hex triplet ==
A hex triplet is a six-digit (or eight-digit), three-byte (or four-byte) hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green, and blue components of the color. The optional fourth byte refers to alpha channel. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors in the 24-bit RGB color scheme. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order:
* Byte 1: red value (color type red)
* Byte 2: green value (color type green)
* Byte 3: blue value (color type blue)
* Byte 4 (optional): alpha value
For example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=123, green=58, blue=30 (a hardwood brown color). The decimal numbers 123, 58, and 30 are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers 7B, 3A, and 1E, respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the six hexadecimal digits together, 7B3A1E in this example.

If any one of the three color values is less than 10 hex (16 decimal), it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits. For example, the decimal triplet 4, 8, 16 would be represented by the hex digits 04, 08, 10, forming the hex triplet 040810.

The number of colors that can be represented by this system is 2563, 166, or 224 = 16,777,216.

===Shorthand hexadecimal form===
An abbreviated, three (hexadecimal)-digit or four-digit form can be used, but can cause errors if software or maintenance scripts are only expecting the long form. Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as repeating each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC as presented on the following CSS example:
.threedigit { color: #09C; }
.sixdigit { color: #0099CC; } /* same color as above */
This shorthand form reduces the palette to 4,096 colors, equivalent of 12-bit color as opposed to 24-bit color using the whole six-digit form (16,777,216 colors). This limitation is sufficient for many text-based documents.

===Converting RGB to hexadecimal===

RGB values are usually given in the 0–255 range; if they are in the 0–1 range, the values are multiplied by 255 before conversion. This number divided by sixteen (integer division; ignoring any remainder) gives the first hexadecimal digit (between 0 and F, where the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15. See hexadecimal for more details). The remainder gives the second hexadecimal digit. For instance, the RGB value 58 (as shown in the previous example of hex triplets) divides into 3 groups of 16, thus the first digit is 3. A remainder of ten gives the hexadecimal number 3A. Likewise, the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C. A remainder of nine gives the hexadecimal number C9. This process is repeated for each of the three color values.

Conversion between number bases is a common feature of calculators, including both hand-held models and the software calculators bundled with most modern operating systems. Web-based tools specifically for converting color values are also available.

==HTML color names==

Recent W3C specifications of color names distinguishes between &quot;basic&quot; and &quot;extended&quot; colors. In HTML and XHTML, colors can be used for text, background color, frame borders, tables, and individual table cells.
===Basic colors===

The basic colors are 16 colors defined in the HTML 4.01 specification, ratified in 1999, as follows (names are defined in this context to be case-insensitive):
These 16 were labeled as sRGB and included in the HTML 3.0 specification, which noted they were &quot;the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette.&quot;

===Extended colors===

Extended colors are the result of merging specifications from HTML 4.01, CSS 2.0, SVG 1.0 and CSS3 User Interfaces (CSS3 UI).

Several colors are defined by web browsers. A particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005, all modern, general-use, graphical browsers support the full list of colors. Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the X Window System. These colors were standardized by SVG 1.0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents. They are not part of SVG Tiny.

The list of colors shipped with the X11 product varies between implementations and clashes with certain of the HTML names such as green. X11 colors are defined as simple RGB (hence, no particular color space), rather than sRGB. This means that the list of colors found in X11 (e.g., in /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt) should not directly be used to choose colors for the web.

The list of web &quot;X11 colors&quot; from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below. Compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards. This includes the common synonyms: aqua (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and cyan (common sRGB name), fuchsia (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and magenta (common sRGB name), gray (HTML4/CSS 1.0 standard name) and grey.


==CSS colors==
The Cascading Style Sheets specification defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 HTML colors, and 124 colors from the Netscape X11 color list for a total of 140 names that were recognized by Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0 and Netscape Navigator 3.0. Blooberry.com notes that Opera 2.1 and Safari 1 also included Netscape&#x27;s expanded list of 140 color names, but later discovered 14 names not included with Opera 3.5 on Windows 98.

In CSS 2.1, the color &#x27;orange&#x27; (one of the 140) was added to the section with the 16 HTML4 colors as a 17th color. The CSS3.0 specification did not include &quot;orange&quot; in the &quot;HTML4 color keywords&quot; section, which was renamed as &quot;Basic color keywords&quot;. In the same reference, the &quot;SVG color keywords&quot; section, was renamed &quot;Extended color keywords&quot;, after starting out as &quot;X11 color keywords&quot; in an earlier working draft. The working draft for the level 4 color module combines the Basic and Extended sections together in a simple &quot;Named Colors&quot; section.


CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2.1 allow web authors to use &quot;system colors&quot;, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system, picking the operating system&#x27;s highlighted text color, or the background color for tooltip controls. This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent. The CSS3 color module has deprecated the use of system colors in favor of CSS3 UI System Appearance property, which itself was subsequently dropped from CSS3.

The CSS3 specification also introduces HSL color space values to style sheets:

/* RGB model */
p { color: #F00 } /* #rgb */
p { color: #FF0000 } /* #rrggbb */
p { color: rgb(255, 0, 0) } /* integer range 0 - 255 */
p { color: rgb(100%, 0%, 0%) } /* float range 0.0% - 100.0% */

/* RGB with alpha channel, added to CSS3 */
p { color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5) } /* 50% opacity, semi-transparent */

/* HSL model, added to CSS3 */
p { color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%) } /* red */
p { color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%) } /* green */
p { color: hsl(120, 100%, 25%) } /* dark green */
p { color: hsl(120, 100%, 75%) } /* light green */
p { color: hsl(120, 50%, 50%) } /* pastel green */

/* HSL model with alpha channel */
p { color: hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 1) } /* green */
p { color: hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.5) } /* semi-transparent green */
p { color: hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.1) } /* very transparent green */
CSS also supports the special color codice_2, which represents an alpha value of zero; by default, codice_2 is rendered as an invisible nominal black: codice_4. It was introduced in CSS1 but its scope of use has expanded over the versions.

=== CSS Color 4 ===
Level 4 of the CSS Color specification introduced several new CSS color formats.

Besides new ways to write colors, it also introduces the concept of mixing colors in a non-sRGB color space, a first step towards fixing a well-known issue in color gradients. Some sections explaining color theory and common operations like gamut mapping are also added to aid implementation.

p { color: #F80A } /* #rgba */
p { color: #FF8800AA } /* #rrggbbaa */
p { color: rgb(255.0 136.0 0.0 / 0.667) } /* float range 0.0 - 255.0 for higher than 8-bit precision */
p { color: rgb(100% 53.3% 0% / 66.7%) } /* float range 0.0% - 100.0% */
p { color: color(sRGB 1 0.533 0 / 0.667) } /* color() function with color space */
==== Device independent color ====
CSS Color 4 introduces several different formats for device independent color that can display the entirety of visible color (in a capable screen), including:
* CIE Lab and LCH
* OKLab and OKLCH (preferred over Lab/LCH)
* XYZ (D50 or D65 [default])

==== Predefined color spaces ====
A number of RGB spaces with gamuts that are wider than sRGB are also introduced through the new codice_5 function:
* Display P3
* Prophoto
* REC.2020
* Adobe 1998 RGB

A linearized variant of sRGB is also defined for color mixing.

==== Other formats ====
On 21 June 2014, the CSS WG added the color RebeccaPurple to the Editor&#x27;s Draft of the Colors module level 4, to commemorate Eric Meyer&#x27;s daughter Rebecca, who died on 7 June 2014, her sixth birthday.


CSS4 also introduces the HWB color model as an alternative to HSL/HSV.

=== CSS Color 5 ===

The draft CSS Color 5 specification introduces syntax for mixing and manipulating existing colors, including:
* A codice_6 function for mixing colors
* Relative color syntax for manipulating components of an existing color

Custom color spaces are also supported via ICC profiles. This allows the use of CMYK on web pages.

==Web-safe colors==
In the mid-1990s, many displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors, dictated by the hardware or changeable by a &quot;color table&quot;. When a color was found (e.g., in an image) that was not available, a different one had to be used. This was done by either using the closest color or by using dithering.

There were various attempts to make a &quot;standard&quot; color palette. A set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allowed exactly six equally spaced shades of red, green, and blue (6 × 6 × 6 = 216), each from 00 to FF (including both limits).

The list of colors was presented as if it had special properties that render it immune to dithering, but on 256-color displays applications could actually set a palette of any selection of colors that they chose, dithering the rest. These colors were chosen specifically because they matched the palettes selected by various browser applications. There were not very different palettes in use in different browsers.

&quot;Web-safe&quot; colors had a flaw in that, on systems such as X11 where the palette is shared between applications, smaller color cubes (5×5×5 or 4×4×4) were allocated by browsers—the &quot;web-safe&quot; colors would dither on such systems. Different results were obtained by providing an image with a larger range of colors and allowing the browser to quantize the color space if needed, rather than suffer the quality loss of a double quantization.

Through the 2000s, use of 256-color displays in personal computers dropped sharply in favour of 24-bit (TrueColor) displays, and the use of &quot;web-safe&quot; colors has fallen into practical disuse.

The &quot;web-safe&quot; colors do not all have standard names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet: each component (red, green, and blue) takes one of the six values from the following table (out of the 256 possible values available for each component in full 24-bit color).

The following table shows all of the &quot;web-safe&quot; colors. One shortcoming of the web-safe palette is its small range of light colors for webpage backgrounds, whereas the intensities at the low end of the range, such as the two darkest, are similar to each other, making them hard to distinguish. Values flanked by &quot;*&quot; (asterisk) are part of the &quot;really safe palette;&quot; see Safest web colors, below.

===Safest web colors===
Designers were encouraged to stick to these 216 &quot;web-safe&quot; colors in their websites because there were a lot of 8-bit color displays when the 216-color palette was developed. David Lehn and Hadley Stern discovered that only 22 of the 216 colors in the web-safe palette are reliably displayed without inconsistent remapping on 16-bit computer displays. They called these 22 colors &quot;the really safe palette&quot;; it consists largely of shades of green, yellow, and cyan.

==Accessibility==

===Color selection===
Some browsers and devices do not support colors. For these displays or blind and colorblind users, Web content depending on colors can be unusable or difficult to use.

Either no colors should be specified (to invoke the browser&#x27;s default colors), or both the background and all foreground colors (such as the colors of plain text, unvisited links, hovered links, active links, and visited links) should be specified to avoid black on black or white on white effects.

===Color contrast===
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines recommend a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between the relative luminance of text and its background color or at least 3:1 for large text. Enhanced accessibility requires contrast ratios greater than 7:1.

However, addressing accessibility concerns is not simply a matter of increasing the contrast ratio. As a report to the Web Accessibility Initiative indicates, dyslexic readers are better served by contrast ratios below the maximum. The recommendations they refer to of off-black (#0A0A0A) on off-white (#FFFFE5) and black (#000000) on creme (#FAFAC8) have contrast ratios of 11.7:1 and 20.3:1 respectively. Among their other color pairs, brown (#282800) on dark green (#A0A000) has a contrast ratio of 3.24:1, which is less than the WCAG recommendation, dark brown (#1E1E00) on light green (#B9B900) has a contrast ratio of 4.54:1 and blue (#00007D) on yellow (#FFFF00) has a contrast ratio of 11.4:1. The colors named in the report use different color values than the web colors of the same name.

<doc id="286628" wikidata="Q2897382" url="?curid=286628" title="Supporters' trust">
<text>In British sports, a supporters&#x27; trust is a formal, democratic and not-for-profit organisation of fans who attempt to strengthen the influence of supporters over the running of the club they support. There are over 140 supporters&#x27; trusts across England, Wales and Scotland and the majority of these are affiliated to football clubs, however trusts also exist for Rugby league and Rugby Union clubs.

With government and with cross-party support, Supporters Direct was established to encourage the formation of supporters&#x27; trusts to promote democratic supporter ownership. Supporters Direct encourages these bodies to be formed as Industrial and Provident Societies (IPSs) and assists with their formation, legal and start-up costs.

Supporters&#x27; trusts were commonly founded in response to financial crises which threaten the future of a team, as was the case at Chesterfield, Lincoln City, York City, and Real Oviedo. Their involvement has reportedly ensured the survival of over 20 different clubs entering into administration, particularly during the period of crisis as a result of the collapse of ITV Digital. Supporters&#x27; trusts are now more commonly founded in order to increase influence at clubs through a financial stake in the club.

The first trust established was at Northampton Town in January 1992. The largest is the Manchester United Supporters Trust, which used to be known as Shareholders United and currently has over 200,000 members. Other large trusts such as Newcastle United Supporters Trust (NUST) With over 10,000 members,Leeds, Exeter City, Dundee United, Reading, Spurs and Glasgow Rangers have between 3,000 and 7,000 members.

== Methods for influencing clubs ==
The main objective of a supporters&#x27; trust is to provide a vehicle for fans to influence the running of their club. This is achieved by a number of different strategies, including gaining control by fundraising to finance the acquisition of shares in the club or direct board representation.

=== Club ownership ===

The most effective method of influencing the running of a club is club ownership. In the UK more than 110 supporters&#x27; trusts currently hold equity within their football clubs while supporters&#x27; trusts have outright or majority ownership or control at two Football League clubs.

=== Board representation ===
Over 40 football clubs currently have supporter representation within the boards of their football clubs, such as the Rangers Supporters Trust at Rangers F.C., Lincoln City Supporters&#x27; Trust at Lincoln City F.C., ArabTRUST at Dundee United F.C., the Oldham Athletic Supporters Trust and the Swans Trust at Swansea City A.F.C. The Bluebirds Trust at Barrow AFC have a board representation and are fundraising to purchase shares. However their formation is different from the vast majority of Trusts, they are not born from crisis but success; Barrow AFC were a members owned club but voted to become a privately owned club. Barrow-born Texan businessman Paul Casson of Casson-Mark (C-Mark) Corp. purchased the club in the Summer of 2014. In Real Oviedo&#x27;s case, when the club was about to go bankrupt, the club started putting shares up for sale to people across the world to help the club. Thousand of people invested, including 2nd richest man Carlos Slim and Youtuber Spencer Owen (aka Spencer F.C). As was the case for Ebbsfleet United.

About 100 football trusts currently have shares in their clubs.

There are many Rugby League supporters&#x27; trusts currently in the UK who run and operate their respective clubs, such as Rochdale Hornets for example, likewise, so do some rugby union clubs, for example Friends of Newport Rugby, representing Newport RFC.

<doc id="286632" wikidata="Q5268227" url="?curid=286632" title="My Pedagogic Creed">
<text>&quot;My Pedagogic Creed&quot; is an article written by John Dewey and published in &quot;School Journal&quot; in 1897. The article is broken into five sections, with each paragraph beginning &quot;I believe.&quot; They address the nature and goals of education (including the relationship of the individual student psyche to societal conditions), the school as a social institution, the importance of the student&#x27;s social activities, precepts on the educational method, and the role of the school in shaping societal values and structures. It has been referenced over 4100 times, and continues to be referenced, as a testament to the lasting impact of the article&#x27;s ideas.

==Summary==

===What education is===
According to John Dewey&#x27;s article &quot;My Pedagogic Creed&quot; (1897), education is only as individual as our society allows it to be. We (people) are unconsciously trained from birth. Our social consciousness, our cultural ways and what we value are a mock up of a collective social being, according to Dewey. We are all a product of our social surroundings from birth through adulthood and death. Eventually we &quot;become an inheritor of the funded capital of civilization.&quot; Dewey exerts that individual best is achieved in the spirit of and for the greater good. &quot;Through these demands he is stimulated to act as a member of a unity, to emerge from his original narrowness of action and feeling and to conceive of himself from the standpoint of the welfare of the group to which he belongs.&quot; As a member of society, we are confined to language and its meanings, but also empowered by it.

Dewey believes that &quot;the educational process has two sides.&quot; Psychological and sociological impacts are two sides of the education process that go hand-in-hand; &quot;neither can be subordinated to the other or neglected without evil results following.&quot; Psychology provides the foundation of education while sociology provides the scenario. Unless what is taught and how we teach relates to students&#x27; lives, it can become stressful. Even good grades are not indicative of authentic learning. Students may become disenfranchised. Psychology and social dynamics must exist in conjunction with each other to create a truly internal experience. It is important to know what is happening in the world-at-large, according to Dewey. One must also look at the student&#x27;s world to ensure success relevant to their own realm of accomplishment. &quot;We must also be able to project them into the future to see what their outcome and end will be.&quot; Dewey holds that we must look into the individual future of every student and see what their own outlook is and how we can get there—not a collective outlook defined by blanket societal expectations of success by every person. Dewey states, &quot;To know what a power really is we must know what its end, use, or function is.&quot; In sum, a student cannot achieve power over their future until they know what their future can be. Teachers cannot prepare students for a future we cannot foretell as a result of ever-changing technology. People can truly prepare for the future by empowering students. In Dewey&#x27;s words, &quot;To prepare him for the future life means to give him command of himself.&quot; Hands-on learning that utilizes the senses and capacity of the student creates the most success, intrinsically and externally. Dewey believes &quot;that the individual who is to be educated as a social individual and that society is an organic union of individuals.&quot; Demonstration of this success shows a psychological process. Utilizing the skills derived from effective psychological learning, social factors can be successfully recognized and addressed.

===What the school is===
Education is a social process. According to the creed, it should not be used for the purposes of preparation for living in the future. Dewey said, &quot;I believe that education, therefore, is a process of living and not a preparation for future living.&quot; We can build a child&#x27;s self-esteem in not only the classroom but in all aspects of his or her life. Education must always stay true to children and align with their reality in order to be true. Dewey argues that some children are over labeled and misunderstood because we take away authentic experiences by not relating education to natural human order. More importantly he emphasizes, &quot;Existing life is so complex that the child cannot be brought into contact with it without either confusion or distraction... and he becomes either unduly specialized or else disintegrated.&quot;

Dewey believes that education and school ought to be an extension of home. Personal background is psychological and gives way to new ideas. This is summed up in the quote, &quot;It is the business of the school to deepen and extend his sense of the values bound up in his home life.&quot; In schools currently, the information is given, lessons are learned and habits are formed, similar to the banking model of education criticised by Paulo Freire in his 1970 book &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot;. Dewey states that this is not effective. Working together is vital to unity and success. He states, &quot;The present educational systems, so far as they destroy or neglect this unity, render it difficult or impossible to get any genuine, regular moral meanings.&quot; We need to see school as a social experience, according to this creed. The teacher is the guide and chooses what relevant experience will guide each child through the education process. When it comes to assessment, Dewey states that grading should be relevant to the child&#x27;s own progress. Exams are to be used for social ordering rather than individual upkeep.

===The subject-matter of education===
Following suit with his other theories, Dewey believes that subject matter should reflect students&#x27; real lives. Schools focus on too many subjects, which may not reflect the students&#x27; actual experiences. The child&#x27;s own activities should determine curriculum. For example, students are often given literature lessons at the beginning of the learning experience, when it is the sum of events, making the subject relevant for the end of learning; This gives the student time to shape his or her own views before being told how history or someone else has seen something. It should be given at the end as a summative reflection. 

We need to let children be constructive and pave their own paths, according to Dewey. &quot;I believe that the only way to make a child conscious of his social heritage is to enable him to perform those fundamental types of activity which makes civilization what it is.&quot; Dewey takes on a constructive point of view. He says that at times vocations may be more relevant and should be main subjects. In order to learn formal subjects, students need to be relaxed. Dewey explains that in order to achieve that, they must be comfortable with what they have learned up to that point. All subjects are relevant to life.

===The nature of method===
# Dewey asserts that active participation far surpasses passive learning. Action must come before anything else. We create children&#x27;s negative perceptions of school. Ideas come from movement. Symbols give an inaccurate and incomplete view of the big picture. They impact the student&#x27;s ability to think authentically.
# Envisioning the message helps with retention. Imagery is so important in generating relevancy to one&#x27;s life.
# It is the teacher&#x27;s job to pay attention to student&#x27;s blooming interests and expand on them for a one of a kind learning experience. Interest is power and we must harbor that interest.
# Welcome emotions in education. They are part of the important aspects of learning.

===The school and social progress===
In Dewey&#x27;s words, &quot;education is the fundamental method of social progress and reform.&quot; Social consciousness shapes individual perceptions. Society also has an obligation to reform education. As a society we are responsible for one another. &quot;I believe it is the business of every one interested in education to insist upon the school as the primary and most effective instrument of social progress and reform in order that society may be awakened to realize what the school stands for, and aroused to the necessity of endowing the educator with sufficient equipment properly to perform his task.&quot; Education is the perfect combination of art and science. Dewey sees that we must use individuality for the greater good. Dewey recognizes that teaching is noble and selfless. Teachers show us our way.

<text>Pasteurellosis is an infection with a species of the bacterial genus &quot;Pasteurella&quot;, which is found in humans and other animals.

&quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot; (subspecies &quot;P. m. septica&quot; and &quot;P. m. multocida&quot;) is carried in the mouth and respiratory tract of various animals, including pigs. It is a small, Gram-negative bacillus with bipolar staining by Wayson stain. In animals, it can originate in fulminant septicaemia (chicken cholera), but is also a common commensal.

Until taxonomic revision in 1999, &quot;Mannheimia&quot; spp. were classified as &quot;Pasteurella&quot; spp., and infections by organisms now called &quot;Mannheimia&quot; spp., as well as by organisms now called &quot;Pasteurella&quot; spp., were designated as pasteurellosis. The term &quot;pasteurellosis&quot; is often still applied to mannheimiosis, although such usage has declined.

==Types==
The several forms of the infection are:
* Skin/subcutaneous tissue disease is a septic phlegmon that develops classically in the hand and forearm after a cat bite. Inflammatory signs are very rapid to develop; in 1 or 2 hours, edema, severe pain, and serosanguineous exudate appear. Fever, moderate or very high, can be seen, along with vomiting, headache, and diarrhea. Lymphangitis is common. Complications are possible, in the form of septic arthritis, osteitis, or evolution to chronicity.
* Sepsis is very rare, but can be as fulminant as septicaemic plague, with high fever, rigors, and vomiting, followed by shock and coagulopathy.
* Pneumonia disease is also rare and appears in patients with some chronic pulmonary pathology. It usually presents as bilateral consolidating pneumonia, sometimes very severe.
* Zoonosis, pasteurellosis can be transmitted to humans through cats.

Other locations are possible, such as septic arthritis, meningitis, and acute endocarditis, but are very rare.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is made with isolation of &quot;Pasteurella multocida&quot; in a normally sterile site (blood, pus, or cerebrospinal fluid).

==Treatment==

As the infection is usually transmitted into humans through animal bites, antibiotics usually treat the infection, but medical attention should be sought if the wound is severely swelling. Pasteurellosis is usually treated with high-dose penicillin if severe. Either tetracycline or chloramphenicol provides an alternative in beta-lactam-intolerant patients. However, it is most important to treat the wound.

==Animals==
&quot;P. multocida&quot; causes numerous pathological conditions in domestic animals. It often acts with other infectious agents, such as &quot;Chlamydia&quot; and &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; species and viruses. Environmental conditions (transportation, housing deficiency, and bad weather) also play a role.

These diseases are considered caused by &quot;P. multocida&quot;, alone or associated with other pathogens:
* Shipping fever in cattle and sheep (&quot;shipping fever&quot; may also be caused by &quot;Mannheimia haemolytica&quot;, in the absence of &quot;P. multocida&quot;, and &quot;M. haemolytica&quot; serovar A1 is known as the most common cause of the disease. The pathologic condition commonly arises where the causative organism becomes established by secondary infection, following a primary bacterial or viral infection, which may occur after stress, e.g. from handling or transport.)
* Enzootic pneumonia of sheep (and goats, with frequent intervention of &quot;M. haemolytica&quot;)
* Fowl cholera (chicken and other domestic poultry and cage birds)
* Enzootic pneumonia and atrophic rhinitis of pigs
* Pasteurellosis of chinchillas
* Pasteurellosis of rabbits
* Pasteurellosis is suspected to be the cause of recurrent mass mortality of Saiga antelopes.

<doc id="286636" wikidata="Q1043326" url="?curid=286636" title="East Village, Manhattan">
<text>The East Village is a neighborhood on the East Side of Lower Manhattan in New York City, United States. It is roughly defined as the area east of the Bowery and Third Avenue, between 14th Street on the north and Houston Street on the south. The East Village contains three subsections: Alphabet City, in reference to the single-letter-named avenues that are located to the east of First Avenue; Little Ukraine, near Second Avenue and 6th and 7th Streets; and the Bowery, located around the street of the same name.

Initially the location of the present-day East Village was occupied by the Lenape Native people, and was then divided into plantations by Dutch settlers. During the early 19th century, the East Village contained many of the city&#x27;s most opulent estates. By the middle of the century, it grew to include a large immigrant populationincluding what was once referred to as Manhattan&#x27;s Little Germanyand was considered part of the nearby Lower East Side. By the late 1960s, many artists, musicians, students and hippies began to move into the area, and the East Village was given its own identity. Since at least the 2000s, gentrification has changed the character of the neighborhood.

The East Village is part of Manhattan Community District 3, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10003 and 10009. It is patrolled by the 9th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.
 Unlike the West Village, the East Village is not located within Greenwich Village.

==History==
===Early development===
The area that is today known as the East Village was originally occupied by the Lenape Native people. The Lenape relocated during different seasons, moving toward the shore to fish during the summers, and moving inland to hunt and grow crops during the fall and winter. Manhattan was purchased in 1626 by Peter Minuit of the Dutch West India Company, who served as director-general of New Netherland.

The population of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam was located primarily below the current Fulton Street, while north of it were a number of small plantations and large farms that were then called &quot;bouwerij&quot; (anglicized to &quot;boweries&quot;; ). Around these farms were a number of enclaves of free or &quot;half-free&quot; Africans, which served as a buffer between the Dutch and the Native Americans. One of the largest of these was located along the modern Bowery between Prince Street and Astor Place, as well as the &quot;only separate enclave&quot; of this type within Manhattan. These Black farmers were some of the earliest settlers of the area.

There were several &quot;boweries&quot; within what is now the East Village. Bowery no.2 passed through several inhabitants, before the eastern half of the land was subdivided and given to Harmen Smeeman in 1647. Peter Stuyvesant, the director-general of New Netherland, owned adjacent bowery no.1 and bought bowery no.2 in 1656 for his farm. Stuyvesant&#x27;s manor, also called Bowery, was near what is now 10th Street between Second and Third Avenues. Though the manor burned down in the 1770s, his family held onto the land for over seven generations, until a descendant began selling off parcels in the early 19th century.

Bowery no. 3 was located near today&#x27;s 2nd Street between Second Avenue and the modern street named Bowery. It was owned by Gerrit Hendricksen in 1646 and later given to Philip Minthorne by 1732. The Minthorne and Stuyvesant families both held enslaved people on their farms. According to an 1803 deed, enslaved people held by Stuyvesant were to be buried in a cemetery plot at St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery. The Stuyvesants&#x27; estate later expanded to include two Georgian-style manors: the &quot;Bowery House&quot; to the south and &quot;Petersfield&quot; to the north.

Many of these farms had become wealthy country estates by the middle of the 18th century. The Stuyvesant, DeLancey, and Rutgers families would come to own most of the land on the Lower East Side, including the portions that would later become the East Village. By the late 18th century Lower Manhattan estate owners started having their lands surveyed to facilitate the future growth of Lower Manhattan into a street grid system. The Stuyvesant plot, surveyed in the 1780s or 1790s, was planned to be developed with a new grid around Stuyvesant Street, a street that ran compass west–east. This contrasted with the grid system that was ultimately laid out under the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, which is offset by 28.9 degrees clockwise. Stuyvesant Street formed the border between former boweries 1and 2, and the grid surrounding it included four north–south and nine west–east streets.

Because each landowner had done their own survey, there were different street grids that did not align with each other. Various state laws, passed in the 1790s, gave the city of New York the ability to plan out, open, and close streets. The final plan, published in 1811, resulted in the current street grid north of Houston Streetand most of the streets in the modern East Villagewere conformed to this plan, except for Stuyvesant Street. The north–south avenues within the Lower East Side were finished in the 1810s, followed by the west–east streets in the 1820s.

===Upscale neighborhood===
The Commissioners&#x27; Plan and resulting street grid was the catalyst for the northward expansion of the city, and for a short period, the portion of the Lower East Side that is now the East Village was one of the wealthiest residential neighborhoods in the city. Bond Street between the Bowery and Broadway, just west of the East Side within present-day NoHo, was considered the most upscale street address in the city by the 1830s, with structures such as the Greek Revival-style Colonnade Row and Federal-style rowhouses. The neighborhood&#x27;s prestigious nature could be attributed to several factors, including a rise in commerce and population following the Erie Canal&#x27;s opening in the 1820s.

Following the grading of the streets, development of rowhouses came to the East Side and NoHo by the early 1830s. One set of Federal-style rowhouses was built in the 1830s by Thomas E. Davis on 8th Street between Second and Third Avenues. That block was renamed &quot;St. Mark&#x27;s Place&quot; and is one of the few remaining terrace names in the East Village. In 1833 Davis and Arthur Bronson bought the entire block of 10th Street from Avenue A to Avenue B. The block was located adjacent to Tompkins Square Park, located between 7th and 10th Streets from Avenue A to Avenue B, designated the same year.

Though the park was not in the original Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, part of the land from 7th to 10th Streets east of First Avenue had been set aside for a marketplace that was ultimately never built. Rowhouses up to three stories were built on the side streets by such developers as Elisha Peck and Anson Green Phelps; Ephraim H. Wentworth; and Christopher S. Hubbard and Henry H. Casey.

Mansions were also built on the East Side. One notable address was the twelve-house development called &quot;Albion Place&quot;, located on Fourth Street between the Bowery and Second Avenue, built for Peck and Phelps in 1832–1833. Second Avenue also had its own concentration of mansions, though most residences on that avenue were row houses built by speculative land owners, including the Isaac T. Hopper House. One &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; article in 1846 said that Second Avenue was to become one of &quot;the two great avenues for elegant residences&quot; in Manhattan, the other being Fifth Avenue.

Two marble cemeteries were also built on the East Side: the New York City Marble Cemetery, built in 1831 on 2nd Street between First and Second Avenues, and the New York Marble Cemetery, built in 1830 within the backlots of the block to the west. Following the rapid growth of the neighborhood, Manhattan&#x27;s 17th ward was split from the 11th ward in 1837. The former covered the area from Avenue B to the Bowery, while the latter covered the area from Avenue B to the East River.

===Immigrant neighborhood===
====19th century====

By the middle of the 19th century, many of the wealthy had continued to move further northward to the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side. Some wealthy families remained, and one observer noted in the 1880s that these families &quot;look[ed] down with disdain upon the parvenus of Fifth avenue&quot;. In general, though, the wealthy population of the neighborhood started to decline as many moved northward. Immigrants from modern-day Ireland, Germany, and Austria moved into the rowhouses and manors.

The population of Manhattan&#x27;s 17th wardwhich includes the western part of the East Village and Lower East Sidegrew from 18,000 in 1840 to over 43,000 by 1850 and to 73,000 persons in 1860, becoming the city&#x27;s most highly populated ward at that time. As a result of the Panic of 1837, the city had experienced less construction in the previous years, and so there was a dearth of units available for immigrants, resulting in the subdivision of many houses in lower Manhattan.

Another solution was brand-new &quot;tenant houses&quot;, or tenements, within the East Side. Clusters of these buildings were constructed by the Astor family and Stephen Whitney. The developers rarely involved themselves with the daily operations of the tenements, instead subcontracting landlords (many of them immigrants or their children) to run each building. Numerous tenements were erected, typically with footprints of , before regulatory legislation was passed in the 1860s.

To address concerns about unsafe and unsanitary conditions, a second set of laws was passed in 1879, requiring each room to have windows, resulting in the creation of air shafts between each building. Subsequent tenements built to the law&#x27;s specifications were referred to as Old Law Tenements. Reform movements, such as the one started by Jacob Riis&#x27;s 1890 book &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot;, continued to attempt to alleviate the problems of the area through settlement houses, such as the Henry Street Settlement, and other welfare and service agencies.

Because most of the new immigrants were German speakers, the East Village and the Lower East Side collectively became known as &quot;Little Germany&quot; (). The neighborhood had the third largest urban population of Germans outside of Vienna and Berlin. It was America&#x27;s first foreign language neighborhood; hundreds of political, social, sports and recreational clubs were set up during this period. Numerous churches were built in the neighborhood, of which many are still extant. In addition, Little Germany also had its own library on Second Avenue, now the New York Public Library&#x27;s Ottendorfer branch. However, the community started to decline after the sinking of the &quot;General Slocum&quot; on June 15, 1904, in which more than a thousand German-Americans died.

The Germans who moved out of the area were replaced by immigrants of many different nationalities. This included groups of Italians and Eastern European Jews, as well as Greeks, Hungarians, Poles, Romanians, Russians, Slovaks and Ukrainians, each of whom settled in relatively homogeneous enclaves. In &quot;How the Other Half Lives&quot; Riis wrote: &quot;A map of the city, colored to designate nationalities, would show more stripes than on the skin of a zebra, and more colors than any rainbow.&quot;

One of the first groups to populate the former Little Germany were Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews, who first settled south of Houston Street before moving northward. The Roman Catholic Poles as well as the Protestant Hungarians would also have a significant impact in the East Side, erecting houses of worship next to each other along 7th Street at the turn of the 20th century. American-born New Yorkers would build other churches and community institutions, including the Olivet Memorial Church at 59 East 2nd Street (built 1891), the Middle Collegiate Church at 112 Second Avenue (built 1891–1892), and the Society of the Music School Settlement, now Third Street Music School Settlement, at 53–55 East 3rd Street (converted 1903–1904).

By the 1890s tenements were being designed in the ornate Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival styles. Tenements built in the later part of the decade were built in the Renaissance Revival style. At the time, the area was increasingly being identified as part of the Lower East Side.

====20th century====

By the 1890s and 1900s any remaining manors on Second Avenue had been demolished and replaced with tenements or apartment buildings. The New York State Tenement House Act of 1901 drastically changed the regulations to which tenement buildings had to conform. The early 20th century marked the creation of apartment houses, office buildings, and other commercial or institutional structures on Second Avenue. After the widening of Second Avenue&#x27;s roadbed in the early 1910s, many of the front stoops on that road were eliminated. The symbolic demise of the old fashionable district came in 1912 when the last resident moved out of the Thomas E. Davis mansion at Second Avenue and St. Mark&#x27;s Place, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; had called the &quot;last fashionable residence&quot; on Second Avenue. In 1916, the Slovenian community and Franciscans established the Slovenian Church of St. Cyril, which still operates.

Simultaneously with the decline of the last manors, the Yiddish Theatre District or &quot;Yiddish Rialto&quot; developed within the East Side. It contained many theaters and other forms of entertainment for the Jewish immigrants of the city. While most of the early Yiddish theaters were located south of Houston Street, several theater producers were considering moving north along Second Avenue by the first decades of the 20th century.

Second Avenue gained more prominence as a Yiddish theater destination in the 1910s with the opening of two theatres: the Second Avenue Theatre, which opened in 1911 at 35–37 Second Avenue, and the National Theater, which opened in 1912 at 111–117 East Houston Street. This was followed by the opening of several other theaters, such as the Louis N. Jaffe Theater and the Public Theatre in 1926 and 1927 respectively. Numerous movie houses also opened in the East Side, including six on Second Avenue. By World WarI the district&#x27;s theaters hosted as many as twenty to thirty shows a night. After World WarII Yiddish theater became less popular, and by the mid-1950s few theaters were still extant in the District.

The city built First Houses on the south side of East 3rd Street between First Avenue and Avenue A, and on the west side of Avenue A between East 2nd and East 3rd Streets in 1935–1936, the first such public housing project in the United States. The neighborhood originally ended at the East River, to the east of where Avenue D was later located. In the mid-20th-century, landfillincluding World WarII debris and rubble shipped from Londonwas used to extend the shoreline to provide foundation for the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.

In the mid-20th century Ukrainians created a Ukrainian enclave in the neighborhood, centered around Second Avenue and 6th and 7th Streets. The Polish enclave in the East Village persisted as well. Numerous other immigrant groups had moved out, and their former churches were sold and became Orthodox cathedrals. Latin American immigrants started to move to the East Side, settling in the eastern part of the neighborhood and creating an enclave that later came to be known as Loisaida.
The East Side&#x27;s population started to decline at the start of the Great Depression in the 1930s and the implementation of the Immigration Act of 1924, and the expansion of the New York City Subway into the outer boroughs. Many old tenements, deemed to be &quot;blighted&quot; and unnecessary, were destroyed in the middle of the 20th century. A substantial portion of the neighborhood, including the Ukrainian enclave, was slated for demolition under the Cooper Square Urban Renewal Plan of 1956, which was to redevelop the area from Ninth to Delancey Streets from the Bowery/Third Avenue to Chrystie Street/Second Avenue with new privately owned cooperative housing.

The United Housing Foundation was selected as the sponsor for the project, and there was significant opposition to the plan, as it would have displaced thousands of people. Neither the original large-scale development nor a 1961 revised proposal were implemented and the city&#x27;s government lost interest in performing such large-scale slum-clearance projects. Another redevelopment project that was completed was the Village View Houses on First Avenue between East 2nd and 6th Streets, which opened in 1964 partially on the site of the old St. Nicholas Kirche.

===Rebranding and cultural scene===
====Initial rebranding====
Until the mid-20th century the area was simply the northern part of the Lower East Side, with a similar culture of immigrant, working-class life. In the 1950s and 1960s the migration of Beatniks into the neighborhood later attracted hippies, musicians, writers, and artists who had been priced out of the rapidly gentrifying Greenwich Village. Among the first displaced Greenwich Villagers to move to the area were writers Allen Ginsberg, W. H. Auden, and Norman Mailer, who all moved to the area in 1951–1953.

A cluster of cooperative art galleries on East 10th Street (later collectively referred to as the 10th Street galleries) were opened around the same time, starting with the Tanger and the Hansa which both opened in 1952. Further change came in 1955 when the Third Avenue elevated railway above the Bowery and Third Avenue was removed. This in turn made the neighborhood more attractive to potential residents; in 1960 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported: &quot;This area is gradually becoming recognized as an extension of Greenwich Village... thereby extending New York&#x27;s Bohemia from river to river.&quot;

The 1960 &quot;Times&quot; article stated that rental agents were increasingly referring to the area as &quot;Village East&quot; or &quot;East Village&quot;. The new name was used to dissociate the area from the image of slums evoked by the Lower East Side. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a 1964 guide called &quot;Earl Wilson&#x27;s New York&quot; wrote: &quot;Artists, poets and promoters of coffeehouses from Greenwich Village are trying to remelt the neighborhood under the high-sounding name of &#x27;East Village&#x27;.&quot; Newcomers and real estate brokers popularized the new name, and the term was adopted by the popular media by the mid-1960s. A weekly newspaper with the neighborhood&#x27;s new name, &quot;The East Village Other&quot;, started publication in 1966. &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared that the neighborhood &quot;had come to be known&quot; as the East Village in the edition of June 5, 1967.

====Growth====
The East Village became a center of the counterculture in New York, and was the birthplace and historical home of many artistic movements, including punk rock and the Nuyorican literary movement. Multiple former Yiddish theaters were converted for use by Off-Broadway shows: for instance, the Public Theater at 66 Second Avenue became the Phyllis Anderson Theater. Numerous buildings on East 4th Street hosted Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway productions, including the Royal Playhouse, the Fourth Street Theatre, the Downtown Theatre, the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, and the Truck &amp; Warehouse Theater just on the block between Bowery and Second Avenue.

By the 1970s and 1980s the city in general was in decline and nearing bankruptcy, especially after the 1975 New York City fiscal crisis. Residential buildings in the East Village suffered from high levels of neglect, as property owners did not properly maintain their buildings. The city purchased many of these buildings, but was also unable to maintain them due to a lack of funds. Following the publication of a revised Cooper Square renewal plan in 1986, some properties were given to the Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association as part of a 1991 agreement.

In spite of the deterioration of the structures within the East Village, its music and arts scenes were doing well. By the 1970s gay dance halls and punk rock clubs had started to open in the neighborhood. These included the Fillmore East Music Hall (later a gay private nightclub called The Saint), which was located in a movie theater at 105 Second Avenue. The Phyllis Anderson Theatre was converted into Second Avenue Theater, an annex of the CBGB music club, and hosted musicians and bands such as Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith, and Talking Heads. The Pyramid Club, which opened in 1979 at 101 Avenue A, hosted musical acts such as Nirvana and Red Hot Chili Peppers, as well as drag performers such as RuPaul and Ann Magnuson. In addition, there were more than a hundred art galleries in the East Village by the mid-1980s. These included Patti Astor and Bill Stelling&#x27;s Fun Gallery at 11th Street, Now Gallery on 9th Street, as well as numerous galleries on 7th Street.

====Decline====
By 1987 the visual arts scene was in decline. Many of these art galleries relocated to more profitable neighborhoods such as SoHo, or closed altogether. The arts scene had become a victim of its own success, since the popularity of the art galleries had revived the East Village&#x27;s real estate market.
One club that tried to resurrect the neighborhood&#x27;s past artistic prominence was Mo Pitkins&#x27; House of Satisfaction, part-owned by comedian Jimmy Fallon before it closed in 2007. A Fordham University study, examining the decline of the East Village performance and art scene, stated that &quot;the young, liberal culture that once found its place on the Manhattan side of the East River&quot; has shifted in part to new neighborhoods like Williamsburg in Brooklyn. There are still some performance spaces, such as Sidewalk Cafe on 6th Street and Avenue A, where downtown acts find space to exhibit their talent, as well as the poetry clubs Bowery Poetry Club and Nuyorican Poets Café.

===Gentrification, preservation, and present day===
In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the East Village became gentrified as a result of real-estate price increases following the success of the arts scene. In the 1970s, rents were extremely low and the neighborhood was considered one of the least desirable places in Manhattan to live in. However, as early as 1983, the &quot;Times&quot; reported that because of the influx of artists, many longtime establishments and immigrants were being forced to leave the East Village due to rising rents. By the following year, young professionals constituted a large portion of the neighborhood&#x27;s demographics. Even so, crimes remained prevalent and there were often drug deals being held openly in Tompkins Square Park.

Tensions over gentrification resulted in the 1988 Tompkins Square Park riot, which occurred following opposition to a proposed curfew that had targeted the park&#x27;s homeless. The aftermath of the riot slowed down the gentrification process somewhat as real estate prices declined. By the end of the 20th century, however, real estate prices had resumed their rapid rise. About half of the East Village&#x27;s stores had opened within the decade since the riot, while vacancy rates in that period had dropped from 20% to 3%, indicating that many of the longtime merchants had been pushed out.

By the early 21st century some buildings in the area were torn down and replaced by newer buildings.
====Rezoning====
Due to the gentrification of the neighborhood, parties including the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP), Manhattan Community Board 3, the East Village Community Coalition, and City Councilmember Rosie Mendez, began calling for a change to the area&#x27;s zoning in the first decade of the 21st century. The city first released a draft in July 2006, which concerned an area bounded by East 13th Street on the north, Third Avenue on the west, Delancey Street on the south, and Avenue D on the east. The rezoning proposal was done in response to concerns about the character and scale of some of the new buildings in the neighborhood. Despite protests and accusations of promoting gentrification and increased property values over the area&#x27;s history and need for affordable housing, the rezoning was approved in 2008. Among other things, the zoning established height limits for new development throughout the affected area, modified allowable density of real estate, capped air rights transfers, eliminated the current zoning bonus for dorms and hotels, and created incentives for the creation and retention of affordable housing.

====Landmark efforts====
Local community groups such as the GVSHP are actively working to gain individual and district landmark designations for the East Village to preserve and protect the architectural and cultural identity of the neighborhood. In early 2011 the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) proposed two East Village historic districts: a small district along the block of 10th Street that lies north of Tompkins Square Park, and a larger district focused around lower Second Avenue. before later being expanded. In January 2012 the East 10th Street Historic District was designated by the LPC, and that October, the larger East Village/Lower East Side Historic District was also designated by the LPC.

Several notable buildings are designated as individual landmarks, some due to the GVSHP&#x27;s efforts. These include:
*The First Houses at East 3rd Street and Avenue A, the country&#x27;s first public housing development, built in 1935 and designated in 1974
*The Stuyvesant Polyclinic at 137 Second Avenue, built in 1884 and designated in 1976
*The Christodora House, built in 1928 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986
*The Children&#x27;s Aid Society&#x27;s Tompkins Square Lodging House for Boys and Industrial School at 296 East 8th Street, built in 1886 and designated in 2000
*Public School 64 at 350 East 10th Street, a French Renaissance Revival public school built in 1904–1906 by architect and school superintendent C.B.J. Snyder, designated in 2006
*Webster Hall, a Romanesque Revival concert hall and nightclub designed in 1886, designated in 2008
*The Children&#x27;s Aid Society&#x27;s Elizabeth Home for Girls at 308 East 12th Street, built in 1891–1892 and designated in 2008
*The Wheatsworth Bakery Building, built in 1927–1928 and designated in 2008
*The St. Nicholas of Myra Church at 288 East 10th Street, designated in 2008
*The Van Tassell and Kearney Horse Auction Mart at 126–128 East 13th Street, a horse auction mart built in 1903–1904, designated in 2012
*The First German Baptist Church (Town &amp; Village Synagogue) at 334 East 14th Street, designated in 2014

Landmark efforts have included a number of losses as well. For instance, although the GVSHP and allied groups asked in 2012 that the Mary Help of Christians school, church and rectory be designated as landmarks, the site was demolished starting in 2013. In 2011, an early 19th-century Federal house at 35 Cooper Squareone of the oldest on the Bowery and in the East Villagewas approved for demolition to make way for a college dorm. over requests of community groups and elected officials. Furthermore, the LPC acts on no particular schedule, leaving open indefinitely some &quot;calendared&quot; requests for designation. Sometimes it simply declines requests for consideration, as it did regarding an intact Italianate tenement at 143 East 13th Street. In other cases the LPC has refused the expansion of existing historic districts, as in 2016 when it declined to add 264 East 7th Street (the former home of illustrator Felicia Bond) and four neighboring rowhouses to the East Village/Lower East Side Historic District.

====2015 gas explosion====
On March 26, 2015, a gas explosion occurred on Second Avenue after a gas line was tapped. The explosion and resulting fire destroyed three buildings at 119, 121 and 123 Second Avenue, between East 7th Street and St. Marks Place. Two people were killed, and at least twenty-two people were injured, four critically. Three restaurants were also destroyed in the explosion. Landlord Maria Hrynenko and an unlicensed plumber and another employee were sentenced to prison time for their part in causing the explosion in New York State Supreme Court. Ms. Hrynenko allowed an illegal gas line to be constructed on her property.

==Geography==
Neighboring the East Village are the Lower East Side to the south, NoHo to the west, Stuyvesant Park to the northwest, and Stuyvesant Town to the northeast. The East Village contains several smaller vibrant communities, each with its own character.

===Subsections===
====Alphabet City====

Alphabet City is the eastern section of the East Village that is so named because it contains avenues with single-lettered names, e.g. Avenues A, B, C, and D. It is bordered by Houston Street to the south and 14th Street to the north. Notable places within Alphabet City include Tompkins Square Park and the Nuyorican Poets Café. Some of the neighborhoods most iconic establishments such as Pyramid Club and Lucy&#x27;s have since shuttered due to new ownership and subsequent evictions. Alphabet City also contains St. Marks Place, the continuation of Eighth Street between Third Avenue and Avenue A. The street contains a Japanese street culture; an aged punk culture and CBGB&#x27;s new store; the former location of one of New York City&#x27;s only Automats; and a portion of the &quot;Mosaic Trail&quot;, a trail of eighty mosaic-encrusted lampposts that runs from Broadway down Eighth Street to Avenue A, to Fourth Street and then back to Eighth Street.

Alphabet City was once the archetype of a dangerous New York City neighborhood. Its turn-around was cause for &quot;The New York Times&quot; to observe in 2005 that Alphabet City went &quot;from a drug-infested no man&#x27;s land to the epicenter of downtown cool&quot;. This part of the neighborhood has long been an ethnic enclave for Manhattan&#x27;s German, Polish, Hispanic, and Jewish populations. Crime went up in the area in the late 20th century but then declined in the 21st, as the area became gentrified. Alphabet City&#x27;s alternate name Loisaida, which is also used as the alternate name for Avenue C, is a term derived from the Latino, and especially Nuyorican, pronunciation of &quot;Lower East Side&quot;. The term was originally coined by poet/activist Bittman &quot;Bimbo&quot; Rivas in his 1974 poem &quot;Loisaida&quot;.

====Bowery====

The Bowery was once known for its many homeless shelters, drug rehabilitation centers and bars. The phrase &quot;on the Bowery&quot;, which has since fallen into disuse, was a generic way to say one was down-and-out. By the 21st century the Bowery had become a boulevard with new luxury condominiums. Redevelopment of the avenue from flophouses to luxury condominiums has met resistance from long-term residents, who agree the neighborhood has improved but its unique, gritty character is disappearing. The Bowery has also become an area with a diverse artistic community. It is the location of the Bowery Poetry Club, where artists Amiri Baraka and Taylor Mead have held regular readings and performances, and until 2006 was home to the punk–rock nightclub CBGB.

====Little Ukraine====
Little Ukraine is an ethnic enclave in the East Village, which has served as a spiritual, political and cultural epicenter for several waves of Ukrainian Americans in New York City as far back as the late 19th century.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Ukrainian immigrants began moving into areas previously dominated by fellow Eastern European and Galician Jews, as well as the Lower East Side&#x27;s German enclave. After World WarII, the Ukrainian population of the neighborhood reached 60,000, but as with the city&#x27;s Little Italy, today the neighborhood consists of only a few Ukrainian stores and restaurants. Today, the East Village between Houston and 14th Street, and Third Avenue and Avenue A still houses nearly a third of New York City&#x27;s Ukrainian population.

Several churches, including St. George&#x27;s Catholic Church; Ukrainian restaurants and butcher shops; The Ukrainian Museum; the Shevchenko Scientific Society; and the Ukrainian Cultural Center are evidence of the impact of this culture on the area. The gallery American Painting, located on E. 6th Street during 2004–2009, presented a painting exhibition by artists Andrei Kushnir and Michele Martin Taylor titled &quot;East Village Afternoon&quot; depicting many of these sites.

Since the early 20th century, St. George Ukrainian Catholic Church has served as the anchor of Little Ukraine, offering daily liturgies and penances, and operating the adjoining St. George Academy, a coeducational parochial school. Starting in 1976 the church has sponsored an annual Ukrainian Heritage Festival, regularly described as one of the few remaining authentic New York City street fairs. In April 1978 the New York City Council renamed Taras Shevchenko Place, a small connecting street between East 7th and 6th Streets, after Taras Shevchenko, Ukraine&#x27;s national bard.

===Political representation===
Politically, the East Village is in New York&#x27;s 7th and 12th congressional districts. It is also in the New York State Senate&#x27;s 27th and 28th districts, the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 65th, 66th, and 74th districts, and the New York City Council&#x27;s 1st and 2nd districts.

==Demographics==
Based on data from the 2020 United States Census, the population of the East Village was 71,436, a change of -353 (-0.5%) from the 71,789 counted in 2010. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 48.9% (34,907) White, 7.6% (5,409) African American, 15.0% (10,734) Asian, and 1.0% (719) from other races, and 3.9% (2,771) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 23.7% (16,896) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 3, which comprises the East Village and the Lower East Side, had 171,103 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 82.2 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are adults: a plurality (35%) are between the ages of 25 and 44, while 25% are between 45 and 64, and 16% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 13% and 11%, respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District3 was US$39,584 (), although the median income in the East Village individually was $74,265 (). In 2018, an estimated 18% of East Village and Lower East Side residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twelve residents (8%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 48% in the East Village and the Lower East Side, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51%, respectively. Based on this calculation, , the East Village and the Lower East Side were considered to be gentrifying.

==Culture==
===Hare Krishnas===
On October 9, 1966, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, held the first recorded outdoor chanting session of the Hare Krishna mantra outside the Indian subcontinent at Tompkins Square Park. This is considered the founding of the Hare Krishna religion in the United States, and the large tree close to the center of the Park is demarcated as a special religious site for Krishna adherents.

==Parks and gardens==
===Large parks===
Tompkins Square Park is a public park in the Alphabet City section of the East Village. It is bounded on the north by 10th Street, on the east by Avenue B, on the south by 7th Street, and on the west by Avenue A. Tompkins Square Park contains a baseball field, basketball courts, and two playgrounds. It also contains the city&#x27;s first dog run, which is a social scene unto itself. The park has been the site of numerous events and riots:
*On January 13, 1874, a riot broke out after the New York City Police Department clashed with a demonstration involving thousands of unemployed civilians.
*On July 25, 1877, during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, twenty thousand people gathered in the park to hear communist orators speak. New York City police and National Guardsmen eventually charged the crowd with billy clubs, later claiming that the rally was not being held in a peaceful manner. In the wake of this &quot;riot&quot; the city, in conjunction with the War Department, established an official city armory program led by the 7th Regiment.
*On August 6–7, 1988, a riot broke out between police and groups of &quot;drug pushers, homeless people and young people known as &#x27;skinheads&#x27;&quot; who had largely taken over the park. The neighborhood was divided about what, if anything, should be done about it. Manhattan Community Board3 adopted a curfew for the previously 24-hour park in an attempt to bring it under control. A rally against the curfew resulted in several clashes between protesters and police.

East River Park is and runs between the FDR Drive and the East River from Montgomery Street to East 12th Street. It was designed in the 1930s by parks commissioner Robert Moses, who wanted to ensure there was parkland along the Lower East Side shorefront. The park includes football, baseball, and soccer fields; tennis, basketball, and handball courts; a running track; and bike paths, including the East River Greenway.

===Community gardens===
There are reportedly more than 640 community gardens in New York Citygardens run by local collectives within the neighborhood who are responsible for the gardens&#x27; upkeepand an estimated ten percent of those are located on the Lower East Side and the East Village alone. Development of these community gardens, often on municipally owned land, started in the early 1970s. Although many of these lots were later sold to private developers, others were taken over by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, which preserves the gardens under its ownership.

Open Road Park, a former cemetery and bus depot, is a garden and a playground adjacent to East Side Community High School between 11th and 12th Streets east of First Avenue.

The Avenue B and 6th Street Community Garden was known for a now-removed outdoor sculpture, the Tower of Toys, designed by artist and long-time garden groundskeeper Eddie Boros. It was a makeshift structure made of wooden planks, from which were suspended an amalgamation of fanciful objects. The tower was a neighborhood icon, having appeared in the opening credits for the television show &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and also appears in the musical &quot;Rent&quot;. It was also controversial: some viewed it as a masterpiece, while others as an eyesore. The tower was dismantled in May 2008 because, according to parks commissioner Adrian Benepe, it was rotting and thus a safety hazard. Its removal was seen by some as a symbol of the neighborhood&#x27;s fading past.

The Toyota Children&#x27;s Learning Garden at 603 East 11th Street is technically a learning garden rather than a community garden. Designed by landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburgh, the garden opened in May 2008 as part of the New York Restoration Project and is designed to teach children about plants.

La Plaza Cultural de Armando Perez is a community garden, open-air theater, and green space at 9th Street and Avenue C. Founded in 1976, the garden continues to operate , despite having been proposed for redevelopment multiple times.

===Marble cemeteries===
On the block bounded by Bowery, Second Avenue, and 2nd and 3rd Streets, is the oldest public cemetery in New York City not affiliated with any religion, the New York Marble Cemetery. Established in 1830, it is open the fourth Sunday of every month.

The similarly named New York City Marble Cemetery, located on 2nd Street between First Avenue and Second Avenue, is the second oldest nonsectarian cemetery in New York City. The cemetery opened in 1831. Notable people interred there include U.S. President James Monroe; Stephen Allen, mayor (1821–1824); James Lenox, whose personal library became part of the New York Public Library; Isaac Varian, mayor (1839–1841); Marinus Willet, Revolutionary War hero; and Preserved Fish, a well-known merchant.

==Police and crime==
East Village is patrolled by the 9th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 321 East 5th Street. The 9th Precinct ranked 58th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. , with a non-fatal assault rate of 42 per 100,000 people, Community District 3&#x27;s rate of violent crimes per capita is less than that of the city as a whole. The incarceration rate of 449 per 100,000 people is higher than that of the city as a whole.

The 9th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 79.5% between 1990 and 2019. The precinct reported 3murders, 15 rapes, 119 robberies, 171 felony assaults, 122 burglaries, 760 grand larcenies, and 37 grand larcenies auto in 2019.

==Fire safety==

===Libraries===
The New York Public Library (NYPL) operates three branches near the East Village.
*The Ottendorfer branch is located at 135 Second Avenue. The branch opened in 1884 based on a gift from Oswald Ottendorfer, who owned the &quot;New Yorker Staats-Zeitung&quot;. The Ottendorfer branch, designed in the Queen Anne and Renaissance Revival styles, is a New York City designated landmark.
*The Tompkins Square branch is located at 331 East 10th Street. The library opened in 1887 and moved three times before relocating to its current Carnegie library structure in 1904.
*The Hamilton Fish Park branch is located at 415 East Houston Street. It was originally built as a Carnegie library in 1909, but was torn down when Houston Street was expanded; the current one-story structure was completed in 1960.

===Colleges===
====New York University====
Along with gentrification, the East Village has seen an increase in the number of buildings owned and maintained by New York University, particularly dormitories for undergraduate students, and this influx has given rise to conflict between the community and the university.

St. Ann&#x27;s Church, a rusticated-stone structure with a Romanesque Revival tower on East 12th Street that dated to 1847, was sold to NYU to make way for a 26-story, 700-bed dormitory. After community protest, the university promised to protect and maintain the church&#x27;s original facade; and so it did, literally, by having the facade stand alone in front of the building, now the tallest structure in the area. According to many residents, NYU&#x27;s alteration and demolition of historic buildings, such as the Peter Cooper Post Office, is spoiling the physical and socio-economic landscape that makes this neighborhood so interesting and attractive.

NYU has often been at odds with residents of both the East and West Villages due to its expansive development plans; urban preservationist Jane Jacobs battled the school in the 1960s. &quot;She spoke of how universities and hospitals often had a special kind of hubris reflected in the fact that they often thought it was OK to destroy a neighborhood to suit their needs,&quot; said Andrew Berman of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.

====Cooper Union====
The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, founded in 1859 by entrepreneur and philanthropist Peter Cooper and located on Cooper Square, was, as of 2008, one of the most selective colleges in the world, and formerly offered tuition-free programs in engineering, art and architecture. Its Great Hall has been used for several notable speeches, such as Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Cooper Union speech, and its New Academic Building is the first in New York City to achieve LEED Platinum status.

<doc id="286651" wikidata="Q2484419" url="?curid=286651" title="Education in Albania">
<text>Education in [[Albania]] for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels are mostly supported by the state. The academic year is much similar to that as in the United States, classes starts almost in September or October and end in June or July. Albanian is the language of instruction in all public schools. The education takes place in three stages such as the primary, secondary, and pre-university education. There are about 5000 schools throughout the nation.

Elementary education is compulsory from grades 1 to 9, but most students continue at least until a secondary education. Students must pass the graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade and also at the end of the 12th grade in order to continue their education. The academic year is divided into two semesters. The school week begins on Monday and ends on Friday.

The &#x27;School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)&#x27; of Albania is 16 years. The nation ranks 25th out of 167 countries. In 2015, the overall literacy rate in Albania was 98.7%; the male literacy rate was 99.2% and female literacy rate was 98.3%.

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) finds that Albania is fulfilling only 87.4% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to education based on the country&#x27;s level of income. HRMI breaks down the right to education by looking at the rights to both primary education and secondary education. While taking into consideration Albania&#x27;s income level, the nation is achieving 86.3% of what should be possible based on its resources (income) for primary education and 88.5% for secondary education.

== Pre-communist period ==
As late as 1945, the literacy rate of the country was raised to about 40%, and in late 1946 the illiteracy rate was 60%. This low percentage was principally because schools using the Albanian language had been practically very low in numbers in the country before it became officially independent in 1912. That is because Albanians didn&#x27;t feel the need of a mass education in their language in the schools system due to them being mostly employed as officials and mercenaries/soldiers in the Ottoman Empire and also due to Albanian tribalism.
However during the 2nd half of the nineteenth century, especially during certain periods in Abdul Hamid II period, the Ottoman rulers had prohibited the use of the Albanian language in schools. Ottoman Turkish was spoken in the few schools that served the Muslim population. These institutions were located mainly in cities and large towns. The schools for Orthodox Christian children were under the supervision of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The teachers at these schools usually were recruited from the Orthodox clergy, and the language of instruction was Greek. The first school known to use Albanian in modern times was a Franciscan seminary that opened in 1861 in Shkodër, though there are mentions of Albanian schools by Franciscans since 1638 in Pdhanë.

From about 1880 to 1910, several Albanian patriots intent on creating a sense of national consciousness founded elementary schools in a few cities and towns, mostly in the south, numbering to a dozen, but these institutions were closed by the Ottoman authorities in 1905 due to the Sultan Abdul Hamid II being scared this might have triggered an Albanian separation from the Ottoman Empire. The advent of the Young Turks movement in 1908 motivated the Albanian patriots to intensify their efforts, and in the same year a group of intellectuals met in Monastir to choose an Albanian alphabet. Books written in Albanian before 1908 had used a mixture of alphabets, consisting mostly of combinations of Latin, Greek, and Turkish-Arabic letters.

The participants in the Monastir meeting developed a unified alphabet based on Latin letters. A number of textbooks soon were written in the new alphabet, and Albanian elementary schools opened in various parts of the country. In 1909, to meet the demand for teachers able to teach in the native tongue, a normal school was established in Elbasan. But in 1910, the Young Turks, fearing the emergence of Albanian nationalism, closed all schools that used Albanian as the language of instruction.

Even after Albania became independent, schools were few in numbers. The unsettled political conditions caused by the Balkan Wars and by World War I hindered the development of a unified education system. When World War I broke out (1914), Albanian education in Albania was scarce. Apart from the Ottoman educational institutions, the local schools were mostly Greek- and a few Aromanian- speaking:
The foreign occupying powers, however, opened some schools in their respective areas of control, each power offering instruction in its own language. A few of these schools, especially the Italian and French ones, continued to function after World War I and played a significant role in introducing Western educational methods and principles. Particularly important was the National Lycée of Korçë, in which the language of instruction was French.

Soon after the establishment of a national government in 1920, which included a ministry of education, the foundation was laid for a national education system. Elementary schools were opened in the cities and some of the larger towns, and the Italian and French schools that had opened during World War I were strengthened. In the meantime, two important American schools were founded: the American Vocational School in Tirana, established by the American Junior Red Cross in 1921, and the American Agricultural School in Kavajë, sponsored by the Near East Foundation. Several future communist party and government luminaries were educated in the foreign schools: Enver Hoxha graduated from the National Lycée in 1930, and Mehmet Shehu, who would become prime minister, completed studies at the American Vocational School in 1932.

In the 1920s, the period when the foundations of the modern Albanian state were laid, considerable progress was made toward development of a genuinely Albanian education system. In 1922, with the request of the intellectuals of Shkodra, the first secular, state gymnasium was established, known as &quot;The State Gymnasium&quot; (&quot;Albanian: Gjimnazi i Shtetit&quot;), recently known as &quot;28 Nëntori&quot; Gymnasium. In 1933 the Royal Constitution was amended to make the education of citizens an exclusive right of the state. All foreign-language schools, except the American Agricultural School, were either closed or nationalised. This move was intended to stop the rapid spread of schools sponsored directly by the Italian government, especially among Roman Catholics in the north.

The nationalisation of schools was followed in 1934 by a far-reaching reorganisation of the entire education system. The new system called for compulsory elementary education from the ages of four to fourteen. It also provided for the expansion of secondary schools of various kinds; the establishment of new technical, vocational, and commercial secondary schools; and the acceleration and expansion of teacher training. The obligatory provisions of the 1934 reorganisation law were never enforced in rural areas because the peasants needed their children to work in the fields, and because of a lack of schoolhouses, teachers, and means of transportation.

The only minority schools operating in Albania before World War II were those for the Greek minority living in the district of Gjirokastër. These schools too were closed by the constitutional amendment of 1933, but Greece referred the case to the International Permanent Court of Justice, which forced Albania to reopen them.

Pre-World War II Albania had no university-level education and all advanced studies were pursued abroad. Every year the state granted a limited number of scholarships to deserving high school graduates, who otherwise could not afford to continue their education. But the largest number of university students came from well-to-do families and thus were privately financed. The great majority of the students attended Italian universities because of their proximity and because of the special relationship between the Rome and Tirana governments. The Italian government itself, following a policy of political, economic, military, and cultural penetration of the country, granted a number of scholarships to Albanian students recommended by its legation in Tirana.

Soon after the Italians occupied Albania in April 1939, the education system came under complete Italian control. Use of the Italian language was made compulsory in all secondary schools, and the fascist ideology and orientation were incorporated into the curricula. After 1941, however, when guerrilla groups began to operate against the Italian forces, the whole education system became paralysed. Secondary schools became centres of resistance and guerrilla recruitment, and many teachers and students went to the mountains to join resistance groups. By September 1943, when Italy capitulated to the Allies and German troops invaded and occupied Albania, education had come to a complete standstill.

== Communist period ==
Upon taking power in late 1944, the communist regime gave high priority to reopening the schools and organising the whole education system to reflect communist ideology. The regime&#x27;s objectives for the new school system were to wipe out illiteracy in the country as soon as possible, to struggle against &quot;bourgeois survivals&quot; in the country&#x27;s culture, to transmit to Albanian youth the ideas and principles of communism as interpreted by the party, and finally to educate the children of all social classes on the basis of these principles. The 1946 communist constitution made it clear that the regime intended to bring all children under the control of the state. All schools were soon placed under state management. At the same time, due to the lack of specialists in many fields of knowledge, a lot of young people were sent abroad to the countries Albania had diplomatic connections with (Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania etc.)

The 1946 Education Reform Law provided specifically that Marxist-Leninist principles would permeate all school texts. This law also made the struggle against illiteracy a primary objective of the new school system. In September 1949, the government promulgated a law requiring all citizens between the ages of twelve and forty who could not read to attend classes in reading and writing. Courses for illiterate peasants were established by the education sections of the people&#x27;s councils. The political organs of the armed forces provided parallel courses for illiterate military personnel.

In addition to providing for free seven-year obligatory elementary schooling and four-year secondary education, the 1946 law called for the establishment of a network of vocational, trade, and teacher-training schools to prepare personnel, technicians, and skilled workers for various social, cultural, and economic activities. Another education law adopted in 1948 provided for the further expansion of vocational and professional courses to train skilled and semiskilled workers and to increase the theoretical and professional knowledge of the technicians.

In the 1950s, the school system was given a thorough Soviet orientation in terms both of communist ideological propaganda and central government control. Secondary technical schools were established along the same lines. In 1951 three institutes of higher learning were founded: the Higher Pedagogic Institute, the Higher Polytechnical Institute, and the Higher Agricultural Institute, all patterned on Soviet models. Most textbooks, especially those dealing with scientific and technical matters, were Soviet translations. Courses for teacher preparation were established in which the Russian language, Soviet methods of pedagogy and psychology, and Marxist-Leninist dialectics were taught by Soviet instructors. A team of Soviet educators laid the structural, curricular, and ideological foundations of the Enver Hoxha University at Tirana (now called University of Tirana), which was established in 1957.

By 1960 the system of elementary and secondary education had evolved into an eleven-year program encompassing schools of general education and vocational and professional institutes. The schools of general education consisted of primary grades one to four, intermediate grades five to seven, and secondary grades eight to eleven. In October 1960, however, as Soviet-Albanian tensions were reaching the breaking point, the Albanian Party of Labour issued a resolution calling for the reorganisation of the whole school system. The resolution&#x27;s real aim was to purge the schools of Soviet influence and rewrite the textbooks. An additional year was added to the eleven-year general education program, and the whole school system was integrated more closely with industry in order to prepare Albanian youth to replace the Soviet specialists, should the latter be withdrawn, as they eventually were in 1961.

A subsequent reform divided the education system into four general categories: preschool, general eight-year program, secondary, and higher education. The compulsory eight-year program was designed to provide pupils with the elements of ideological, political, moral, aesthetic, physical, and military education. The new system lowered the entrance age for pupils from seven to six, and no longer separated primary and intermediate schools.

Secondary education began with grade nine (usually at age fourteen), and ended with grade twelve. Secondary schools offered four-year general education programs or four-year vocational and professional programs, including industrial, agricultural, pedagogic, trade, arts, and health tracks, among others. Some programs lasted only two years.

The term of study in the institutes of higher education lasted three to five years, and tuition was also free at this level. Provision was made to expand higher education by increasing the number of full-time students, setting up new branches in places where there were no post-secondary institutes, and organising specialised courses in which those who had completed higher education would be trained to become highly qualified technical and scientific cadres. All full-time graduate students had to serve a probationary period of nine months in industrial production and three months in military training, in addition to the prescribed military training in school. There were also post-secondary Party schools, such as Lenin Higher Party School, which existed simply to promote the regime&#x27;s philosophy.

Adult education was provided in the same sequence as full-time schooling for younger students, with two exceptions. First, the eight-year general education segment was noncompulsory, and was compressed into a six-year program that allowed for completion of the first four grades in two years. Second, those who wanted to proceed to higher institutes after completing secondary school had to devote one year to preparatory study instead of engaging in production work, as full-time students did.

Official statistics indicated that the regime made considerable progress in education. Illiteracy had been virtually eliminated by the late 1980s. From a total enrolment of fewer than 60,000 students at all levels in 1939, the number of people in school had grown to more than 750,000 by 1987; also, there were more than 40,000 teachers in Albania. About 47% of all students were female. The proportion of eighth-grade graduates who continued with some type of secondary education increased from 39% in 1980 to 73% in 1990, with no village reporting a figure lower than 56%.

== Contemporary ==

A reorganisation plan was announced in 1990 that would extend the compulsory education program from eight to ten years. The following year, however, a major economic and political crisis in Albania, and the ensuing breakdown of public order, plunged the school system into chaos. Widespread vandalism and extreme shortages of textbooks and supplies had a devastating effect on school operations, prompting Italy and other countries to provide material assistance. The minister of education reported in September 1991 that nearly one-third of the 2,500 schools below the university level had been ransacked and fifteen school buildings razed. Many teachers relocated from rural to urban areas, leaving village schools understaffed and swelling the ranks of the unemployed in the cities and towns; about 2,000 teachers fled the country. The highly controlled environment that the communist regime had forced upon the educational system over the course of more than forty-six years was finally liberated set for improvement.
As in Communism, teacher discipline remains a major problem in the Albanian education system, as teachers resort to violence, while students are expected to simply memorise the assigned material. Furthermore, corruption among teachers is becoming a problem as &#x27;envelopes&#x27; and expensive gifts are the norm when faced with important deadlines, such as entry averages, or failing the grade. However, there has been an effort to adopt the Western model whereby the student is at the centre of the education system as opposed to the current Eastern model where the teacher holds the dominant role.
In the late 1990s, many schools were rebuilt or reconstructed to improve learning conditions through the Soros Open Society Foundations. Most of the improvements have happened in the larger cities, such as the capital Tirana. The latter suffers from vast overcrowding of classrooms, resulting in 2 daytime teaching shifts, while heating during the winter is a major problem. The old communist propaganda has been taken out of all school curricula and more emphasis has been put on mathematics, sciences and humanities. The school week was shortened from 6 to a 5-day week. Some of the wealthier schools have begun introducing computers, but many schools still lack basic supplies for laboratory classes.

Meanwhile, private, non-public institutions across all levels have opened up with improved teaching material, staff, and added extra curricular activities but expensive fees. Similar changes have also taken place in the post-secondary level. A number of private universities have been established in different cities of Albania, offering students possibilities of studying in different branches. E-learning programs have begun to be introduced, offering students the possibility of following online courses. However, some post-secondary private institutions have become known as simply &quot;diploma factories&quot;, as was the case with the granting of a controversial university diploma to the son of famous Italian politician Umberto Bossi. As a result, the Albanian government has closed a dozen of such institutions in an attempt to clamp down on the phenomenon.

Between 2009 and 2013, the textbook industry was deregulated in an effort to make textbooks more affordable thus offering a wider choice to students and instructors. However, the sector became vulnerable to favouritism and the Albanian education system experienced a decline in quality. It became flooded with texts written by writers without credible credentials resulting in mediocre texts with dubious content. One of them featured a story about mixing chalk with water and drinking it to become ill and skip classes. A physics textbook required students to find the colour of a bear, which was chasing a human up a tree. Other texts made explicit use of profanity.

Since 2013, the above texts were banned and more reputable ones from Pearson and Oxford were introduced in an effort to harmonise the Albanian education system with the EU. In addition, students between grades 1 to 5 are provided with free textbooks.

In the winter of 2018-19, student protests took place in Tirana to demand better education infrastructure, slash tuition fees, and denounce favouritism, corruption, and sexual favours among teaching staff. The government accepted the demands, and student dorms at Student City in Tirana are being reconstructed as part of the University Pact between the government and public academic institutions in Albania.

In recent years, foreign students mainly from Southern Italy are getting enrolled in Italian-affiliated universities in Tirana in the hope of better preparing for entrance exams in Italy&#x27;s universities.

<doc id="286672" wikidata="Q1027822" url="?curid=286672" title="Graceland (album)">
<text>Graceland is the seventh solo studio album by the American singer-songwriter Paul Simon. It was produced by Simon, engineered by Roy Halee and released on August 25, 1986, by Warner Bros. Records. It incorporates genres including pop, rock, &quot;a cappella&quot;, zydeco, and South African styles such as &quot;isicathamiya&quot; and &quot;mbaqanga&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Simon&#x27;s relationship with his former musical partner Art Garfunkel had deteriorated, his marriage to the actress Carrie Fisher had collapsed, and his previous record, &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; (1983), had been a commercial failure. In 1984, after a period of depression, Simon became fascinated by a bootleg cassette of &quot;ombaqanga&quot;, South African street music. He and Halee spent two weeks in Johannesburg recording with South African musicians. Further recordings were held in the US with American musicians including Linda Ronstadt, the Everly Brothers, Rockin&#x27; Dopsie and the Twisters and Los Lobos. Simon toured with South African musicians, performing their music and songs from &quot;Graceland&quot;.

Organizations such as Artists United Against Apartheid criticized Simon for breaking the cultural boycott on South Africa imposed for its policy of apartheid. Simon responded that &quot;Graceland&quot; was a political statement that showcased collaboration between black and white people and raised international awareness of apartheid. Some praised him for helping popularize African music in the west, while others accused him of appropriating the music of another culture. 

&quot;Graceland&quot; became Simon&#x27;s most successful studio album and his highest-charting album in over a decade. It is estimated to have sold more than 16 million copies worldwide. It received acclaim, won the 1987 Grammy for Album of the Year, and is frequently cited as one of the best albums in history. In 2006, it was added to the US National Recording Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important&quot;.

==Background==

Following a series of hit records released in the 1970s, Simon&#x27;s career declined. His relationship with his former musical partner Art Garfunkel had again deteriorated; his sixth solo studio album, &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; (1983), achieved the lowest sales of his career; and his marriage to the actress Carrie Fisher collapsed. &quot;I had a personal blow, a career setback, and the combination of the two put me into a tailspin,&quot; he recalled.

In 1984, Simon agreed to produce a record by a young singer-songwriter, Heidi Berg, who had played in the house bands for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;The New Show&quot;. As an example of how she wanted her record to sound, Heidi lent Simon a bootlegged tape of &quot;mbaqanga&quot;, black street music from the Soweto township of Johannesburg. Simon described it as &quot;very good summer music, happy music&quot; that reminded him of 1950s rhythm and blues. He began improvising melodies over it as he listened in his car.

Simon asked his contacts at his label, Warner, to identify the artists on the tape. Through the South African record producer Hilton Rosenthal, Warner confirmed that the music was South African and played by either the vocal group Ladysmith Black Mambazo or the Boyoyo Boys. Simon considered buying the rights to his favorite song on the tape, &quot;Gumboots&quot;, and using it to write his own song, as he had with the song &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot; in the 1960s. Instead, Rosenthal suggested that Simon record an album of South African music, and sent him dozens of records from South African artists.

In the 1980s, recording in South Africa was dangerous, and the United Nations had imposed a cultural boycott for its policy of apartheid, or forced racial segregation. The boycott forced states to &quot;prevent all cultural, academic, sporting and other exchanges&quot; with South Africa, and ordered writers, artists, musicians and &quot;other personalities&quot; to boycott it. Nonetheless, Simon resolved to go to South Africa. He later told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;I knew I would be criticized if I went, even though I wasn&#x27;t going to record for the government ... or to perform for segregated audiences. I was following my musical instincts in wanting to work with people whose music I greatly admired.&quot;

Before leaving for Johannesburg, Simon contributed to &quot;We Are the World&quot;, a charity single benefiting African famine relief. Simon discussed recording in South Africa with the &quot;We Are the World&quot; producers Quincy Jones and Harry Belafonte, who both encouraged him to go. The South African black musicians&#x27; union also voted to let Simon come, as it could benefit their music by placing it on an international stage. When Simon told Berg of his plans to record an album inspired by the tape she had lent him, their working relationship deteriorated.

==Recording==

In February 1985, Simon and his longtime engineer, Roy Halee, flew to Johannesburg, intending their visit to be secret. The Warner executives were uninterested in the project, viewing Simon as a bad investment due to the failure of his previous two solo albums. Simon felt their indifference worked in his favor, as it gave him more freedom. Halee believed the executives viewed him and Simon as &quot;crazy&quot;.

Rosenthal used his connections to assemble musicians who had inspired Simon, including Lulu Masilela, Tao Ea Matsekha, General M. D. Shirinda and the Gaza Sisters and the Boyoyo Boys Band. Though musicians in Johannesburg were typically paid $15 an hour, Simon arranged to pay them $200 an hour, around triple the rate for top players in New York City. Simon said he &quot;wanted to be as above board as I could possibly be&quot;, as many of the musicians did not know who he was and would not be lured by the promise of royalties alone. He also offered royalties to those he felt had contributed to composing songs.

Recording sessions took place at Ovation Studios. Halee worried the studio would be a &quot;horror show&quot; but was surprised to find it &quot;very comfortable&quot;. He likened it to a garage, which Halee feared would be a problem for recording, and none of the musicians wore headphones. Jam sessions ranged from 10 to 30 minutes, and Simon and Halee intended to assemble an album from the recordings on their return home. Though the playing was technically simple, Simon found it difficult to mimic. Outside the studio, the public was hostile toward Simon, but the Musician&#x27;s Union received him warmly.

Though Simon described the recording sessions as &quot;euphoric&quot;, he recalled &quot;tension below the surface&quot; due to the effects of apartheid. The musicians would become anxious when recording continued into the evening, since they were prohibited from using public transportation or being on the streets after curfew. Simon recalled, &quot;In the middle of the euphoric feeling in the studio, you would have reminders that you&#x27;re living in an incredibly tense racial environment, where the law of the land was apartheid.&quot;

At the end of the two-week trip, Simon felt a relief from his personal turmoil and a revitalized passion for music. He and Halee returned to the Hit Factory studio in New York City to edit the material. Simon flew several South African musicians to New York to complete the record three months after the Johannesburg sessions. The sessions resulted in &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; and &quot;Under African Skies&quot;. Simon began writing lyrics at his home in Montauk, New York, while listening to the recordings. The process was slow, but he determined he had sufficient material to begin rerecording. He played the tracks backward to &quot;enhance their sound&quot;, interspersing gibberish to complete the rhythms.

Simon involved guest musicians, including the American singer Linda Ronstadt and his childhood heroes the Everly Brothers. During a trip to Louisiana with Richard &quot;Dickie&quot; Landry, Simon saw a performance by the Lafayette zydeco band Good Rockin&#x27; Dopsie and the Twisters, and recorded &quot;That Was Your Mother&quot; with them in a small studio behind a music store. He felt that the accordion, central to zydeco, would make a pleasing transition back to his own culture. Afterward, he contacted the Mexican-American band Los Lobos, with which he recorded &quot;All Around the World or The Myth of Fingerprints&quot; in Los Angeles.

Halee edited the album with new digital technology, transferring analog tape recordings to the digital workspace countless times. He said: &quot;The amount of editing that went into that album was unbelievable ... without the facility to edit digital, I don&#x27;t think we could have done that project.&quot; He used tape echo and delay on every song, and paid particular attention to the bass, saying: &quot;The bassline is what the album is all about. It&#x27;s the essence of everything that happened.&quot; Each song was mixed in about two days at the Hit Factory, where most of the vocal overdubs were recorded.

==Music==
&quot;Graceland&quot; incorporates genres including pop, rock, &quot;a cappella&quot;, zydeco, &quot;isicathamiya&quot; and &quot;mbaqanga&quot;. &quot;Mbaqanga&quot;, or &quot;township jive&quot;, originated as the street music of Soweto, South Africa. The album was influenced by the work of the South African musicians Johnny Clegg and Sipho Mchunu, and their band Juluka&#x27;s Zulu-Western pop crossover music. Juluka was South Africa&#x27;s first integrated pop band. Simon includes thanks to Clegg, Juluka, and Juluka&#x27;s producer Hilton Rosenthal in the liner notes. He included American &quot;roots&quot; influences with tracks featuring zydeco musicians such as Rockin&#x27; Dopsie and Tex-Mex musicians.

&quot;Graceland&quot; alternates between playful and more serious songs. Simon thought of it as like a play: &quot;As in a play, the mood should keep changing. A serious song may lead into an abstract song, which may be followed by a humorous song.&quot; On many songs, Simon and Halee employ a Synclavier to &quot;enhance&quot; the acoustic instruments, creating an electronic &quot;shadow&quot;.

&quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; is a collaboration with the Lesotho group Tau Ea Matsekha. &quot;Graceland&quot; features the bassist Bakithi Kumalo and the guitarist Ray Phiri. Simon wrote in the original liner notes that it reminded him of American country music, and wrote: &quot;After the recording session, Ray told me that he&#x27;d used a relative minor chord—something not often heard in South African music—because he said he thought it was more like the chord changes he&#x27;d heard in my music.&quot; The steel guitarist Demola Adepoju contributed to the track some months after its completion. &quot;I Know What I Know&quot; is based on music from an album by General M.D. Shirinda and the Gaza Sisters. Simon was attracted to their work due to the unusual style of guitar playing, as well as the &quot;distinctive sound&quot; of the women&#x27;s voices. &quot;Gumboots&quot; is a re-recording (with additional saxophone solos) of the song with which Simon first found himself enamored from the cassette tape that spawned &quot;Graceland&quot;.

Joseph Shabalala also contributed to &quot;Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes&quot;, with Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Senegalese singer-percussionist Youssou N&#x27;Dour. It was recorded a week following their appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The pennywhistle solo featured on &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; was performed by Morris Goldberg, a white South African living in New York. &quot;Homeless&quot; was written jointly by Simon and Shabalala, the lead singer of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, to a melody from a traditional Zulu wedding song. In the song &quot;Under African Skies&quot;, &quot;the figure of Joseph becomes the dual image of a dispossessed African black man and the New Testament Joseph.&quot; For the song, Simon sent Shabalala a cassette demo, and the two later met at Abbey Road Studios in London, where the rest of the song was completed. &quot;Crazy Love&quot; features music from Stimela, Phiri&#x27;s group that was very successful in South Africa.

==Lyrics==
To write lyrics, Simon listened to the recordings made during his time in Johannesburg, identifying patterns in the music to fit to verses. He said:

Simon told &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau in 1986 that he was bad at writing about politics, and felt his strength was writing about relationships and introspection. In contrast to &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot;, &quot;Graceland&quot; subject matter is more upbeat. Simon made an effort to write simply without compromising the language. Composing more personal songs took him significantly longer, as it involved &quot;a lot of avoidance going on&quot;. Rewrites were necessary as Simon ended up using overcomplicated words. A perfectionist, Simon rewrote songs only to scrap the newer versions. Songs such as &quot;Graceland&quot; and &quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; took three to four months, while others, such as &quot;All Around the World&quot; and &quot;Crazy Love&quot;, came together quickly.

&quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot; discusses starvation and terrorism, but mixes this with wit and optimism. Simon concurred with this assessment: &quot;Hope and dread—that&#x27;s right. That&#x27;s the way I see the world, a balance between the two, but coming down on the side of hope.&quot; The song retains a variation of the only lyric Simon composed on his South African trip: &quot;The way the camera follows him in slo-mo, the way he smiled at us all.&quot; The imagery was inspired by the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan. &quot;Homeless&quot; discusses poverty within the black majority in South Africa. According to Simon&#x27;s ex-wife Carrie Fisher, the &quot;Graceland&quot; lines &quot;She&#x27;s come back to tell me she&#x27;s gone / As if I didn&#x27;t know that, as if I didn&#x27;t know my own bed / As if I&#x27;d never noticed the way she brushed her hair from her forehead&quot; refer to her. She confirmed she had a habit of brushing her hair from her forehead, and said she felt privileged to be in one of Simon&#x27;s songs.

Throughout the recording process, Simon remained unsure of the album&#x27;s thematic connection. He kept dozens of yellow legal pads with random words and phrases he would combine in an attempt to define the album. He derived the album title from the phrase &quot;driving through Wasteland&quot;, which he changed to &quot;going to Graceland&quot;, a reference to Elvis Presley&#x27;s Memphis home. Simon believed it represented a spiritual direction: just as he had embarked on a physical journey to collect ideas in Africa, he would spiritually journey to the home of the rock &quot;forefather&quot; to revitalize his love for music.

== Allegations of plagiarism ==
&quot;That Was Your Mother&quot; features the American zydeco band Rockin&#x27; Dopsie and the Zydeco Twisters. The band leader, Alton Jay Rubin, felt Simon had derived it from his song &quot;My Baby, She&#x27;s Gone&quot;, but decided not to take legal action.

The American group Los Lobos appears on the track &quot;All Around the World or the Myth of Fingerprints&quot;. The Los Lobos saxophone player, Steve Berlin, said Simon &quot;stole&quot; the song from them: &quot;We go into the studio, and he had quite literally nothing. I mean, he had no ideas, no concepts, and said, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s just jam.&quot; ... Paul goes, &quot;Hey, what&#x27;s that?&quot; We start playing what we have of it, and it is exactly what you hear on the record.&quot; He said Los Lobos had never received a song credit or payment. 

According to Berlin, when he contacted Simon about the lack of credit, Simon responded: &quot;Sue me. See what happens.&quot; Simon denied this, and said: &quot;The album came out and we heard nothing. Then six months passed and &quot;Graceland&quot; had become a hit and the first thing I heard about the problem was when my manager got a lawyer&#x27;s letter. I was shocked.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Graceland&quot; was released by Warner Bros. with little promotion in September 1986. Before its release, Simon speculated that he was no longer &quot;a viable commercial force in popular music&quot;.

By July 1987, &quot;Graceland&quot; had sold six million copies worldwide. That year, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; David Fricke said the album had become &quot;a daily soundtrack in urban yuppie condos and suburban living rooms and on radio airwaves from Australia to Zimbabwe&quot;. In South Africa, it was the best-selling release since Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (1982). It sold 150,000 copies in Australia in 1988, and had sold 470,000 copies there by January 1989. As of 2014, &quot;Graceland&quot; was estimated to have sold more than 16 million copies.

In 2004, &quot;Graceland&quot; was reissued with three previously unreleased demo tracks. In 2012, it was reissued in a 25th-anniversary edition with further demos, a live concert DVD, and a documentary. In June 2018, Sony Music and Legacy Records issued &quot;Graceland: The Remixes&quot;, featuring remixes of &quot;Graceland&quot; songs by artists including Paul Oakenfold, Groove Armada, and Thievery Corporation.
== Tour ==
The &quot;Graceland&quot; tour began on February 1, 1987. Simon was accompanied by an ensemble of 24 black South Africans, including the singer Miriam Makeba, the trumpeter Hugh Masekela, the guitarist Ray Phiri, and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. To ensure the musicians were paid well, Simon took no payment, saying &quot;the show breaks even as long as I don&#x27;t get paid&quot;. The tour ended with two concerts in Harare, Zimbabwe, which were filmed for release as &quot;Graceland: The African Concert&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Graceland&quot; received widespread acclaim upon release. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Rob Tannenbaum characterized it as &quot;lovely, daring and accomplished&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;With his characteristic refinement, Mr. Simon has fashioned that event into the rock album equivalent of a work of literature.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau deemed it Simon&#x27;s best record since his 1972 self-titled album, as well as &quot;a tremendously engaging and inspired piece of work&quot;. It went on to top &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for that year (1986).

Retrospective reviews have remained favorable. According to AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann, &quot;&quot;Graceland&quot; became the standard against which subsequent musical experiments by major artists were measured.&quot; Joe Tangari of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;its songs transcend the context as listening experiences. These songs are astute and exciting, spit-shined with the gloss of production that bears a lot of hallmarks of the era but somehow has refused to age. Taken as a whole, the album offers tremendous insight into how we live in our world and how that changes as we get older.&quot; Patrick Humphries of BBC Music wrote that &quot;it may well stand as the pinnacle of his remarkable half-century career ... Simon fashioned a record which was truly, blindingly original, and – listening to it a quarter of a century on – modern and timeless.&quot; Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote: &quot;The character of the base music here is overwhelming: complex, ebullient and life-affirming, and in yoking this intricate dance music to his sophisticated New Yorker sensibility, Simon created a transatlantic bridge that neither pandered to nor patronised either culture.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Graceland&quot; earned Simon the Best International Solo Artist award at the 1987 Brit Awards. It was ranked No. 84 in a 2005 survey by British television&#x27;s Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time.

&quot;Graceland&quot; was ranked 81st on the 2003 list of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, as &quot;an album about isolation and redemption that transcended &#x27;world music&#x27; to become the whole world&#x27;s soundtrack.&quot; The ranking increased to 71st in the 2012 revision and 46th in the 2020 list. In 2000 it was voted number 43 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. The song &quot;Graceland&quot; was named #485 in the 2004 list of Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2006, &quot;Graceland&quot; was added to the US National Recording Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically important&quot;.

==Criticism from anti-apartheid movement==
After &quot;Graceland&quot;&#x27;s success, Simon was criticized by organizations such as Artists United Against Apartheid, anti-apartheid musicians including Billy Bragg, Paul Weller and Jerry Dammers, and James Victor Gbeho, the Ghanaian Ambassador to the United Nations. They condemned him for having potentially damaged anti-apartheid solidarity by breaking the cultural boycott against apartheid in South Africa.

Before going to South Africa, Simon sought advice from Harry Belafonte, with whom he had recently collaborated on &quot;We Are the World&quot;. Belafonte had mixed feelings and advised him to discuss the matter with the African National Congress (ANC). At a launch party for &quot;Graceland&quot;, Simon said of the criticism: &quot;I&#x27;m with the artists. I didn&#x27;t ask the permission of the ANC. I didn&#x27;t ask permission of Buthelezi, or Desmond Tutu, or the Pretoria government. And to tell you the truth, I have a feeling that when there are radical transfers of power on either the left or the right, the artists always get screwed.&quot;

James Victor Gbeho, the former Ghanaian ambassador to the UN, was critical, saying: &quot;When he goes to South Africa, Paul Simon bows to apartheid. He lives in designated hotels for whites. He spends money the way whites have made it possible to spend money there. The money he spends goes to look after white society, not to the townships.&quot; Simon denied that he went to South Africa to &quot;take money out of the country&quot;, saying he paid the black artists well and split royalties with them, and was not paid to play to a white audience. The South African guitarist Ray Phiri said: &quot;We used Paul as much as Paul used us. There was no abuse. He came at the right time and he was what we needed to bring our music into the mainstream.&quot;

Some criticized Simon for not addressing apartheid in his lyrics. Simon responded: &quot;Was I supposed to solve things in a song?&quot; He said he was not good at writing protest songs in the vein of Bob Dylan or Bob Geldof, and felt that although it was not overtly political, &quot;Graceland&quot; was its own political statement: &quot;I still think it&#x27;s the most powerful form of politics, more powerful than saying it right on the money, in which case you&#x27;re usually preaching to the converted. People get attracted to the music, and once they hear what&#x27;s going on within it, they say, &#x27;What? They&#x27;re doing &quot;that&quot; to these people?&#x27;&quot;

The United Nations Anti-Apartheid Committee supported &quot;Graceland&quot;, as it showcased black South African musicians and offered no support to the South African government, but the ANC protested it as a violation of the boycott. The ANC voted to ban Simon from South Africa and he was added to the United Nations blacklist. He was removed from the blacklist in January 1987, and announced that he had been cleared by the ANC, but the Artists Against Apartheid founder, Dali Tambo, denied this. The &quot;Graceland&quot; concert at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall prompted protests from Dammers, Weller and Bragg. In 2012, the controversy was revived when Simon returned to London for a 25th-anniversary concert.

&quot;Graceland&quot; introduced some of the musicians, especially Ladysmith Black Mambazo, to global audiences. Hugh Masekela, one of South Africa&#x27;s most prominent musicians and an exiled opponent of apartheid, praised Simon for encouraging black South African music. The South African jazz musician Jonas Gwangwa criticized the notion that Simon deserved praise: &quot;So, it has taken another white man to discover my people?&quot;

Some critics viewed &quot;Graceland&quot; as colonialist, with Simon appropriating the music of another culture to bring to the global market. The &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; reporter Tris McCall wrote in 2012: &quot;Does it complicate matters to realize that these musicians were second-class citizens in their own country, one groaning under the weight of apartheid? How could Simon approach them as equal partners when their own government demanded that they treat him as a superior?&quot; In 2012, Andrew Mueller of &quot;Uncut&quot; wrote: &quot;Apartheid was of course a monstrosity, but it would be absurd to suggest that Simon&#x27;s introduction of South Africa&#x27;s music to the world prolonged it and quite plausible to suggest that it did some small amount to hasten its undoing.&quot;

===Linda Ronstadt===

Simon&#x27;s choice to feature the American singer Linda Ronstadt on &quot;Under African Skies&quot; was criticized, as three years earlier she had accepted $500,000 to perform at Sun City, a South African luxury resort. Nelson George of &quot;Billboard&quot; said her inclusion on &quot;Graceland&quot; was like &quot;using gasoline to put out birthday candles&quot;, and Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;Even if the lyric called for total US divestiture, Ronstadt&#x27;s presence on &quot;Graceland&quot; would be a slap in the face to the world anti-apartheid movement.&quot;

Simon defended Ronstadt, saying: &quot;I know that her intention was never to support the government there ... She made a mistake. She&#x27;s extremely liberal in her political thinking and unquestionably antiapartheid.&quot; He told &quot;Spin&quot; he did not think Ronstadt would play at Sun City again, and did not think she was &quot;incompatible&quot; with the record.

Simon had refused to perform on the 1985 antiapartheid single &quot;Sun City&quot;, as the demo had included a list of names shaming artists who had performed at the resort, including Ronstadt&#x27;s, and as he felt &quot;Graceland&quot; would be &quot;my own statement&quot;. He said he had refused two offers to perform at Sun City, and drew a distinction between going to South Africa to perform for a segregated audience, which he felt was unacceptable, and going to record.

===Threats against Simon===
The cultural boycott against South Africa was lifted in 1991, five years after &quot;Graceland&quot;&#x27;s release. At the invitation of the anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela and with the support of the African National Congress, Simon and his band played five shows, beginning at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg. Before the first concert, hand grenades were thrown into the office of the promoter, Attie van Wyk, who had booked the shows. A sect of the militant Azanian People&#x27;s Organisation (AZAPO) claimed responsibility for the attack, which destroyed the office but caused no injuries.

Simon held a clandestine meeting with AZAPO representatives, offering them proceeds from the tour, but no agreement was reached. At a press conference, AZAPO said there was &quot;potential for violence&quot; if the show proceeded. Though hundreds of protesters threatened violence at one concert, it was protected by 800 policemen and proceeded without incident.

According to the guitarist Steven Van Zandt, who was involved in the anti-apartheid movement and met with AZAPO representatives, Simon had been &quot;at the top&quot; of AZAPO&#x27;s assassination list. Van Zandt said he persuaded them that murdering Simon would not help them achieve their goals, and mollified them by saying he was attempting to unite the music community against apartheid.

== Legacy ==
The &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Jon Pareles said &quot;Graceland&quot; popularized African rock in the west, alongside albums such as Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;So&quot; (1986) and Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Remain in Light&quot; (1980). A 2012 documentary film, &quot;Under African Skies&quot;, was directed by Joe Berlinger for the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary, and includes archival footage, interviews, discussion of the controversy, and coverage of an anniversary reunion concert.

Advocates for &quot;Graceland&quot; feel its music transcends the racial and cultural barriers of its production. Andrew Leahey of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Graceland&quot; was never just a collection of songs, after all; it was a bridge between cultures, genres and continents, not to mention a global launching pad for the musicians whose popularity had been suppressed under South Africa&#x27;s white-run apartheid rule.&quot; Presenting the album in a modern context, Tris McCall of the &quot;Star-Ledger&quot; wrote: &quot;In a sense, Simon was ahead of his time: the curatorial approach he took to assembling full tracks from scraps of songs and pre-existing recordings is closer in execution to that of Kanye West than it is to any of his contemporaries.&quot; In 2012, Rolling Stone wrote that it was &quot;hard to even remember the charges of cultural imperialism that greeted &quot;Graceland&quot; when it was released&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;it was unique in its total, and totally natural, synthesis of musical strains that turned out to be not nearly as different from each other as its listeners might have expected, and the result resonated strongly around the world and across generations&quot;.

The album has influenced musicians including Regina Spektor, Bombay Bicycle Club, Gabby Young, Casiokids, the Very Best, Givers, Lorde and Vampire Weekend. Vampire Weekend faced criticism that their 2008 debut album was too similar to &quot;Graceland&quot;, due to its origins in African music. Simon defended them, saying: &quot;In a way, we were on the same pursuit, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re lifting from me, and anyway, you&#x27;re welcome to it, because everybody&#x27;s lifting all the time. That&#x27;s the way music grows and is shaped.&quot;

<doc id="286681" wikidata="Q194376" url="?curid=286681" title="Flash point">
<text>The flash point of a material is the &quot;lowest liquid temperature at which, under certain standardized conditions, a liquid gives off vapours in a quantity such as to be capable of forming an ignitable vapour/air mixture&quot;.

The flash point is sometimes confused with the autoignition temperature, the temperature that causes spontaneous ignition. The fire point is the lowest temperature at which the vapors keep burning after the ignition source is removed. It is higher than the flash point, because at the flash point vapor may not be produced fast enough to sustain combustion. Neither flash point nor fire point depends directly on the ignition source temperature, but ignition source temperature is far higher than either the flash or fire point, and can increase the temperature of fuel above the usual ambient temperature to facilitate ignition.

== Fuels ==
The flash point is a descriptive characteristic that is used to distinguish between flammable fuels, such as petrol (also known as gasoline), and combustible fuels, such as diesel.

It is also used to characterize the fire hazards of fuels. Fuels which have a flash point less than are called flammable, whereas fuels having a flash point above that temperature are called combustible.

== Mechanism ==
All liquids have a specific vapor pressure, which is a function of that liquid&#x27;s temperature and is subject to Boyle–Mariotte law. As temperature increases, vapor pressure increases. As vapor pressure increases, the concentration of vapor of a flammable or combustible liquid in the air increases. Hence, temperature determines the concentration of vapor of the flammable liquid in the air. A certain concentration of a flammable or combustible vapor is necessary to sustain combustion in air, the lower flammable limit, and that concentration is specific to each flammable or combustible liquid. The flash point is the lowest temperature at which there will be enough flammable vapor to support combustion when an ignition source is applied.

== Measurement ==
There are two basic types of flash point measurement: open cup and closed cup. In open cup devices, the sample is contained in an open cup which is heated and, at intervals, a flame brought over the surface. The measured flash point will actually vary with the height of the flame above the liquid surface and, at sufficient height, the measured flash point temperature will coincide with the fire point. The best-known example is the Cleveland open cup (COC).

There are two types of closed cup testers: non-equilibrial, such as Pensky-Martens, where the vapours above the liquid are not in temperature equilibrium with the liquid, and equilibrial, such as Small Scale (commonly known as Setaflash), where the vapours are deemed to be in temperature equilibrium with the liquid. In both these types, the cups are sealed with a lid through which the ignition source can be introduced. Closed cup testers normally give lower values for the flash point than open cup (typically lower) and are a better approximation to the temperature at which the vapour pressure reaches the lower flammable limit. In addition to the Penskey-Martens flash point testers, other non-equilibrial testers include TAG and Abel, both of which are capable of cooling the sample below ambient for low flash point materials. The TAG flash point tester adheres to ASTM D56 and has no stirrer, while the Abel flash point testers adheres to IP 170 and ISO 13736 and has a stirring motor so the sample is stirred during testing.

The flash point is an empirical measurement rather than a fundamental physical parameter. The measured value will vary with equipment and test protocol variations, including temperature ramp rate (in automated testers), time allowed for the sample to equilibrate, sample volume and whether the sample is stirred.

Methods for determining the flash point of a liquid are specified in many standards. For example, testing by the Pensky-Martens closed cup method is detailed in ASTM D93, IP34, ISO 2719, DIN 51758, JIS K2265 and AFNOR M07-019. Determination of flash point by the Small Scale closed cup method is detailed in ASTM D3828 and D3278, EN ISO 3679 and 3680, and IP 523 and 524.

CEN/TR 15138 Guide to Flash Point Testing and ISO TR 29662 Guidance for Flash Point Testing cover the key aspects of flash point testing.

== Examples ==
Gasoline (petrol) is a fuel used in a spark-ignition engine. The fuel is mixed with air within its flammable limits and heated by compression and subject to Boyle&#x27;s law above its flash point, then ignited by the spark plug. To ignite, the fuel must have a low flash point, but in order to avoid preignition caused by residual heat in a hot combustion chamber, the fuel must have a high autoignition temperature.

Diesel fuel flash points vary between . Diesel is suitable for use in a compression-ignition engine. Air is compressed until it heats above the autoignition temperature of the fuel, which is then injected as a high-pressure spray, keeping the fuel-air mix within flammable limits. A diesel-fueled engine has no ignition source (such as the spark plugs in a gasoline engine), so diesel fuel can have a high flash point, but must have a low autoignition temperature.

Jet fuel flash points also vary with the composition of the fuel. Both Jet A and Jet A-1 have flash points between , close to that of off-the-shelf kerosene. Yet both Jet B and JP-4 have flash points between .

== Standardization ==

Flash points of substances are measured according to standard test methods described and defined in a 1938 publication by T.L. Ainsley of South Shields entitled &quot;Sea Transport of Petroleum&quot; (Capt. P. Jansen). The test methodology defines the apparatus required to carry out the measurement, key test parameters, the procedure for the operator or automated apparatus to follow, and the precision of the test method. Standard test methods are written and controlled by a number of national and international committees and organizations. The three main bodies are the CEN / ISO Joint Working Group on Flash Point (JWG-FP), ASTM D02.8B Flammability Section and the Energy Institute&#x27;s TMS SC-B-4 Flammability Panel.

<doc id="286683" wikidata="Q164634" url="?curid=286683" title="Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)">
<text>The Symphony No. 10 in F-sharp major by Gustav Mahler was written in the summer of 1910, and was his final composition. At the time of Mahler&#x27;s death, the composition was substantially complete in the form of a continuous draft, but not fully elaborated or orchestrated, and thus not performable. Only the first movement is regarded as reasonably complete and performable as Mahler intended. Perhaps as a reflection of the inner turmoil he was undergoing at the time (Mahler knew that he had a failing heart and that his wife had been unfaithful), the 10th Symphony is arguably his most dissonant work.

==Composition==
Mahler started work on his tenth symphony in July 1910 in Toblach, and ended his efforts in September. 
He did not complete the orchestral draft before his May 1911 death at the age of 50 from a streptococcal infection of the blood.

Mahler&#x27;s drafts and sketches for the Tenth Symphony comprise 72 pages of full score, 50 pages of continuous short score draft (two of which are missing), and a further 44 pages of preliminary drafts, sketches, and inserts. In the form in which Mahler left it, the symphony has five movements:

# &quot;Andante–Adagio&quot;: 275 bars drafted in orchestral and short score
# &quot;Scherzo&quot;: 522 bars drafted in orchestral and short score
# &quot;Purgatorio. Allegro moderato&quot;: 170 bars drafted in short score, the first 30 of which were also drafted in orchestral score
# &quot;[Scherzo. Nicht zu schnell]&quot;: about 579 bars drafted in short score
# &quot;Finale. Langsam, schwer&quot;: 400 bars drafted in short score

The parts in short score were usually in four staves. The designations of some movements were altered as work progressed: for example, the second movement was initially envisaged as a finale. The fourth movement was also relocated many times. Mahler then started on an orchestral draft of the symphony, which begins to bear some signs of haste after the halfway point of the first movement. He had got as far as orchestrating the first two movements and the opening 30 bars of the third movement when he had to put the work aside to make final revisions to the Ninth Symphony.

The circumstances surrounding the composition of the Tenth were highly unusual. Mahler was at the height of his compositional powers, but his personal life was in complete disarray, most recently compounded by the revelation that his young wife, Alma, had had an affair with the architect Walter Gropius. Mahler sought counseling from Sigmund Freud, and dedicated the Eighth Symphony to Alma on the verge of its successful première in Munich in a desperate attempt to repair the breach. The unsettled frame of Mahler&#x27;s mind found expression in the despairing comments (many addressed to Alma) on the manuscript of the Tenth, and must have influenced its composition: on the final page of the final movement, Mahler wrote, &quot;für dich leben! für dich sterben!&quot; (To live for you! To die for you!) and the exclamation &quot;Almschi!&quot; (his pet name for Alma) underneath the last soaring phrase.

==Instrumentation==
While instrumentation of the symphony cannot be defined precisely, owing to the incompleteness of the orchestral draft, the short score has occasional indications of instrumentation, and some of the orchestration may be surmised from the three movements of the orchestral draft. Deryck Cooke&#x27;s performing version of the symphony (the one most often performed today) calls for the following orchestra:

;Woodwinds:
:4 flutes (4th doubling piccolo)
:4 oboes (4th doubling cor anglais)
:3 B and A clarinets
:E clarinet (doubling 4th clarinet)
:bass clarinet
:4 bassoons (3rd and 4th doubling contrabassoons)
;Brass:
:4 horns
:4 trumpets
:4 trombones
:tuba
;Percussion:
:6 timpani (two players)
:bass drum
:snare drum
:large muffled military drum
:cymbals
:triangle
:tam-tam
:glockenspiel
:xylophone
;Strings:
:2 harps
:1st violins
:2nd violins
:violas
:cellos
:double basses

==Realisations of the work==

===Early attempts===
After Mahler&#x27;s death there was no immediate attempt to complete the symphony, or render it in a state where it could be performed, although figures such as Paul Stefan described the high quality of the work as drafted. Arnold Schoenberg famously expressed the opinion that no one could possibly write a Tenth Symphony without being close to the hereafter (see Curse of the ninth); and a mistaken report led Richard Specht to suggest Mahler wanted the manuscript burned after his death. Hence it was only in the 1920s that Alma Mahler-Werfel asked the composer Ernst Krenek to make a fair copy of Mahler&#x27;s orchestral draft for a festival of performances of Mahler works, and at about the same time some of the manuscripts were published by the company of Paul Zsolnay in facsimile (1924). The facsimile made evident that the stress of Mahler&#x27;s final year had not adversely affected the composition, and that the draft contained passages of great beauty. Much of the manuscript, however, was too difficult to read and seemingly too chaotic for the unbroken continuity of the music to be clearly apparent.

In 1924 Krenek made a fair copy of only the first (Adagio) and third (Purgatorio) movements, and might have made a fair copy of the second movement, but as Mahler&#x27;s draft of the Scherzo was very much patchier this was evidently less feasible. Alban Berg was enlisted to proofread the work, but his suggested corrections were never incorporated, while at the same time some unauthorised changes were introduced, possibly by one of the conductors of the first two performances, Franz Schalk and Alexander von Zemlinsky. Krenek is supposed to have renounced the changes to his version, which was subsequently published. Performances of the Krenek-Schalk/Zemlinsky version have been moderately successful, but the third movement is not generally convincing when taken out of context between the second and fourth movements: it is possible that some of the conductors who have refused to perform the Tenth, most famously Bruno Walter, Bernard Haitink and Leonard Bernstein, took exception to such a piecemeal representation.

In 1923, Alma had also sent a copy of the score to Willem Mengelberg in Amsterdam with the addition that two parts (the &quot;Adagio&quot; and &quot;Purgatorio&quot;) were &#x27;absolutely performable&#x27;. Briefly after Schalk performed Krenek&#x27;s score (with his own additions) on October 12, 1924, Alma sent what is believed to be Schalk&#x27;s score to Mengelberg, who subsequently prepared his own edition with the aid of his assistant Cornelis Dopper. This version uses a larger orchestra and makes significant changes in dynamic markings and tempi. It was premiered on November 27, 1924, in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, and subsequently played a number of times under Mengelberg&#x27;s baton. This version has since received its first performance in nearly 100 years in December 2019 with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Jaap van Zweden, who later recorded it.

It was soon realised that a performing version of only two movements did not give listeners a clear idea of the entire symphony, let alone constitute a complete artistic statement, so in the 1940s the American Mahler enthusiast Jack Diether tried to encourage several notable composers to realise the work. Figures such as Shostakovich, Schoenberg, and Britten (all of whom had been considerably influenced by the works of Mahler) refused, and instead the task was taken up by musicologists: early attempts at realising the entire work were made in America by Clinton Carpenter (completed 1949, subsequently revised 1966), in Germany by Hans Wollschläger (1954–1960, withdrawn), and in England by Joe Wheeler (1953–1965) and Deryck Cooke (1959–1960, 1966–1972 and 1976).

===Deryck Cooke&#x27;s versions===
The various realisations produced by Cooke have, since the mid-1960s, become the basis for most performances and recordings.

A first, still incomplete performing version by Cooke stemmed from a performance and an associated lecture for radio broadcast on the BBC Third Programme, marking the centenary of Mahler&#x27;s birth. This was aired on 19 December 1960, with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Berthold Goldschmidt, who also assisted with the orchestration of Cooke&#x27;s edition. At its first performance Cooke&#x27;s realisation of the final movement proved to be a revelation to listeners, and Cooke resolved to complete the orchestration and elaboration of the Scherzo movements, which required much more compositional work than he had time for.

Alma Mahler, who had at one point taken the views of Bruno Walter to heart and demanded a veto on further performances of the Cooke performing version, actually changed her mind upon seeing Cooke&#x27;s revised score and hearing the recording. She wrote Cooke a letter in English, postmarked New York, 8 May 1963, which Cooke includes in the preface pages to the score:
Dear Mr. Cooke,

Mr. Harold Byrns visited me here in New York. Today he read me your excellent articles on Mahler&#x27;s Tenth Symphony and [showed me] your equally authoritative score. Afterwards I expressed my desire to finally listen to the London BBC tape. I was so moved by this performance that I immediately asked Mr. Byrns to play the work a second time. I then realised that the time had come when I must reconsider my previous decision not to permit the performance of this work. I have now decided once and for all to give you full permission to go ahead with performances in any part of the world. I enclose [a] copy of my letter of even date to [the] BBC.&lt;br&gt;
Sincerely yours, Alma Maria Mahler

Cooke&#x27;s revised and completed version, conducted by Goldschmidt, was premièred at the Proms on 13 August 1964 and recorded soon after. After Alma&#x27;s death in December 1964, her daughter Anna allowed Cooke access to the full set of manuscript sketches, many of which had not been published four decades earlier. In the light of these, Cooke made a revised performing version in association with the British composers Colin and David Matthews between 1966 and 1972, and thereafter his final version before his death in 1976. The release of these pages also prompted the International Gustav Mahler Society in Vienna to issue another, more complete collection of Mahler&#x27;s manuscripts in facsimile (Ricke, 1967). This revised edition of Cooke&#x27;s first complete score was published in 1976, shortly before Cooke&#x27;s death. A further revision, with mostly minor changes made by the three surviving collaborators, appeared in print in 1989.

====Summary of the Cooke versions====
Cooke&#x27;s performing editions of the Tenth Symphony may be summarised as follows:
; Cooke O – (1960, unpublished)
:BBC performance; realizations of 1st, 3rd and 5th movements; partial realizations of 2nd and 4th movements; presented as part of a lecture-demonstration
; Cooke I – first complete performing version (1960–1964, unpublished)
:premiered 13 August 1964 by Berthold Goldschmidt; basis for recordings by Eugene Ormandy (1965–66) and Jean Martinon (1966)
; Cooke II – second performing version (1966–1972, printed 1976)
:premiered 15 October 1972 by Wyn Morris; basis for all recordings 1972–1992
; Cooke III – slightly revised form of Cooke II (printed 1989)
:reading errors corrected; minor changes to orchestration; enhanced by considerations concerning performance; editorial input from David and Colin Matthews and Berthold Goldschmidt; pages altered are marked with asterisks

===Other complete versions===
Clinton Carpenter (1921–2005) started working on his edition long before Cooke, and called his score a &quot;completion&quot; rather than a &quot;performing version&quot;. Although he finished his version in 1949 (revising the work in 1966), it had to wait until 1983 for a performance. Carpenter did not merely review Mahler&#x27;s symphonic output to guide him in his effort, but went so far as to include actual quotations from every Mahler symphony in his edition. The view has been expressed that much of this process of recomposition gives the impression that Carpenter has effectively written his own symphony using Mahler&#x27;s as a basis.

The completion by Joseph Wheeler dates from 1953 to 1965, and like Cooke he also refined his ideas several times, so the final version of 1965 was actually the fourth iteration; the American composer Remo Mazzetti Jr. considers Wheeler&#x27;s fourth version to be the closest to Mahler&#x27;s late orchestral style. Wheeler&#x27;s interventions are at the opposite end of the spectrum to Carpenter&#x27;s, and he is less interventionist even than Cooke: he only makes additions to the score where performance is otherwise impossible. The effect is sparer than other completions, although Wheeler does increase the brass part to a greater degree than Cooke.

In recent years several further realisations of the symphony have been attempted: Remo Mazzetti initially made his 1989 version from dissatisfaction with the existing Cooke, Carpenter, and Wheeler editions, though the spur of preparing a performance of Wheeler&#x27;s version in 1997 led him to recant his earlier view. Of his own revised version he remarked, &quot;I really believe I got things right this time&quot;. Two more completions have been produced since, by the conductor Rudolf Barshai (2000), and a joint effort by Nicola Samale and Giuseppe Mazzuca (2001). All have been performed and recorded. The version by Samale and Mazzuca was commercially released in 2008 on Octavia Records, through Exton from Japan, with Martin Sieghart conducting the Arnhem Philharmonic Orchestra.

Another new version, by the Israeli-American conductor Yoel Gamzou, was premiered in Berlin in September 2010. Its author conducted the International Mahler Orchestra.

====Chamber version====
A chamber orchestra &#x27;recreation&#x27; by the Maltese composer Michelle Castelletti premiered in November 2012 in Canterbury, UK, by the Canterbury Chamber Orchestra under Castelletti&#x27;s direction. This version was recorded in October 2017 by Lapland Chamber Orchestra under the direction of John Storgårds and released by BIS Records on Super Audio CD (SACD) in March 2019. This chamber version was also recorded by Ensemble Mini under the direction of Joolz Gale in june 2016. This recording was released on SACD on the label Ars Produktion in 2021.

In 2011–12 the Portuguese composer/conductor/clarinetist Luis Carvalho produced another chamber version, this one for an ensemble of 21 players, which he revised in 2013–14. Described as a &quot;reinvention of the draft&quot;, this version was premiered under Carvalho&#x27;s direction in June 2014 at the 37th International Music Festival of Paços de Brandão.

====Piano transcription====
A piano transcription of the first movement (in the pre-Cooke 1950s UMP edition) was made by the British composer Ronald Stevenson; to this the English pianist Christopher White added solo transcriptions of the other movements in 2010. This composite version (whose last four movements do not follow Cooke&#x27;s edition at all points) has been recorded with White as soloist.

===Recomposition of the first movement===
A project to recompose and recontextualise the first movement using samples and electronic effects was completed by Matthew Herbert and released by Deutsche Grammophon in 2010.

==Musical form==
For his Tenth, Mahler devised a symmetrical structure with two large slow movements enclosing a core of faster inner movements, at the very centre of which is the &quot;Purgatorio&quot; movement.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; \relative c&#x27; { \set Staff.instrumentName = #&quot;Vla&quot; \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;viola&quot; \clef treble \key fis \major \numericTimeSignature \time 4/4 \tempo &quot;Andante&quot; \partial 8*1 cis8\pp | d4.( b8) g&#x27;4. fis16 eis | d4.( ais!16 b) b&#x27;2~ | b4( ais) fis( g) | cis1 } &lt;/score&gt; 
The opening of the symphony, which is in the key of F major, maintains a connection with the final movement of the Ninth. A long, bleak Andante melody for violas alone leads to the exposition of the slow first theme in the strings. This theme is developed and another, lighter theme is introduced. The music dies away and the violas repeat the opening theme. With slight variation, the opening adagio is repeated and developed with growing intensity. This also soon dies away, leaving several variations on the lighter second theme, followed by the climax, an extremely intense variation of the first theme. This restatement culminates in an extraordinary dissonance, after which the piece becomes very quiet.
:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; { \new PianoStaff « \new Staff \with { \remove &quot;Time_signature_engraver&quot; } \relative c { \clef treble &lt;g&#x27; ees c a&gt;1 } \new Staff \with { \remove &quot;Time_signature_engraver&quot; } \relative c { \clef bass &lt;f d b gis cis,&gt; } » } &lt;/score&gt;

The second movement, the first of two Scherzo movements, consists of two main ideas, the first of which is notated in consistently changing metres, which would have proved a challenge to Mahler&#x27;s conducting technique had he lived to perform the symphony. This alternates with a joyful and typically Mahlerian &quot;Ländler&quot;. It is almost certainly this movement Paul Stefan had in mind when he described the symphony as containing &quot;gaiety, even exuberance&quot; (Cooke&#x27;s translation).

The &quot;Purgatorio&quot; movement (originally entitled &quot;Purgatorio oder Inferno&quot; but the word &quot;Inferno&quot; was struck out) is a brief vignette presenting a struggle between alternately bleak and carefree melodies with a perpetuum mobile accompaniment, that are soon subverted by a diabolical undercurrent of more cynical music. The short movement fails to end in limbo though, as after a brief recapitulation a sudden harp arpeggio and gong stroke pull the rug out from under it; it is consigned to perdition by a final grim utterance from the double basses. According to Colin Matthews the title of this movement is almost certainly a reference to a poem about betrayal by his friend Siegfried Lipiner, rather than to Dante.

The scene is now set for the second scherzo, which has a somewhat driven and harried character, and which has significant connections to Mahler&#x27;s recent work: the sorrowful first movement of &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, &quot;Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde&quot;. There is an annotation on the cover of the draft to the effect that in this movement &quot;The Devil dances with me&quot;, and at the very end Mahler wrote &quot;Ah! God! Farewell my lyre!&quot;. Cooke&#x27;s version finishes with a percussion coda employing both timpanists, bass drum, and a large military drum which is to be muffled, that leads directly into the final slow movement. This scherzo differs from the first scherzo in tone, portraying a graver and more sinister mood.

The fifth and final movement begins with a military drum. This may be a reference to a funeral procession that Mahler once observed: on February 16, 1908, while staying with Alma in the Hotel Majestic on Central Park West in New York City, the funeral cortège of Deputy Fire Chief Charles W. Kruger (whose death in the line of duty inspired the creation of the Manhattan Firemen&#x27;s Memorial) stopped below their hotel window. From his room on the 11th floor, the only sound that could be heard was the muffled stroke of a large bass drum preceding a moment of silence. The introduction to the fifth movement re-enacts this scene as a rising line on tubas supported by two double bassoons slowly tries to make headway and is repeatedly negated by the loud (but muffled) drum strokes. However, some musicologists believe that this narrative has been made up by Alma Mahler, and that the use of the drums in fact stems from the shock Mahler suffered when he found out about his wife&#x27;s affair.

The emotional weight of the symphony is resolved by the long final movement, which incorporates and ties together music from the earlier movements, whereby the opening passage of the symphony, now transferred to the horns, is found to be the answer that tames the savage dissonance that had disturbed the end of the first movement. The music of the flute solo that was heard after the introductory funeral scene can now return to close the symphony peacefully, and unexpectedly, in the principal key of F major. The draft for this movement reveals that Mahler had originally written the ending in B major, but in the process of revision worked the same music into F, the key of the first movement.

==Recordings of Mahler&#x27;s Tenth==
The original, incomplete Cooke version was first recorded by the BBC as noted above; the first complete version (denoted Cooke I) was also premièred by Goldschmidt, this time with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1964; the first commercial recording appeared in 1966 (recorded in 1965), conducted by Eugene Ormandy with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Several notable recordings of the revised Cooke (version II) have been made: the first, made by Wyn Morris in 1972 has recently been reissued. Simon Rattle&#x27;s 1980 recording with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra gave the former percussionist an opportunity to make some pointed revisions, most noticeably giving prominence to the military drum in the fifth movement, which is played as loudly as possible without being muffled or dampened.

Other notable recordings include those of: Kurt Sanderling – Berliner Sinfonie-Orchester – 1979; Cooke II – employing revisions/alterations by Sanderling himself and Berthold Goldschmidt; Riccardo Chailly – Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra – 1986; Cooke II; Eliahu Inbal – Frankfurt Radio Symphony – 1993; Cooke II, and Rattle again – this time with the Berlin Philharmonic – 1999; Cooke III, again with alterations by Rattle. Cooke&#x27;s second version was also recorded by James Levine and the Philadelphia Orchestra. The Adagio movement from this recording was originally recorded and released in 1978, as the fourth side of a 2-LP set containing a complete performance of the 5th symphony, recorded the previous year. The remaining movements of Cooke II were recorded in 1980. The same performance of the 1978 Adagio was incorporated with the 1980 recording of the remainder in a different 2-LP set, with no apparent differences in sound quality.

Some conductors, notably Hermann Scherchen, Leonard Bernstein, Bernard Haitink, Pierre Boulez, Michael Tilson Thomas, Rafael Kubelík, Václav Neumann, Claudio Abbado, Klaus Tennstedt, Lorin Maazel and Gennady Rozhdestvensky have chosen to perform and record just the Adagio, since they interpret it as the only movement completed by Mahler himself. Other noted Mahlerians, such as Georg Solti, omit the Tenth from their repertoire altogether.

In 2011, to mark the centenary of Mahler&#x27;s death, Testament Records released a 3-CD set featuring Cooke&#x27;s BBC lecture, the 1960 studio performance of the incomplete version as well as the 1964 world premiere conducted by Goldschmidt. The release received a Gramophone Award in the &#x27;Historical&#x27; category.

<text>Rodrigues Ottolengui (March 15, 1861 – July 11, 1937) was an American writer and dentist of Sephardic descent. Born in Charleston, South Carolina, he moved to New York City, where he would spend most of his adult life, in 1877.

==Biography==

One of three children, Ottolengui was a son of Daniel Ottolengui and Helen Rosalie Rodrigues Ottolengui; he had a sister, Helen, and a brother, Lee. He was cousins with Octavus Roy Cohen, who also wrote crime fiction.

He was the editor of &quot;Items of Interest: A Monthly Magazine of Dental Art, Science, and Literature&quot; for thirty-five years, which he continued to edit after retiring from dentistry; he compiled &quot;Table Talks on Dentistry&quot;, drawing from articles in &quot;Items of Interest&quot;. A dental pioneer, Ottolengui was one of the first to use X-rays and was a specialist in orthodontics and root canal therapy. He was also interested in entomology, taxidermy, and photography.

In addition to his work in dentistry, Ottolengui is remembered as an early exponent of detective fiction, with four novels and a short story collection published during the 1890s. The short story volume, &quot;Final Proof&quot;, was recognized by Ellery Queen as one of &quot;Queen&#x27;s Quorum&quot;—the most important collections of detective short stories. Many years later a second series, &quot;Before the Fact&quot;, originally published in 1901, was discovered and published in book form edited and introduced by detective fiction scholar Douglas G. Greene.

His wife, May C. Hall Ottolengui, died on 10 July 1936; he died at his New York residence the next year of a heart ailment and a stroke caused by a long illness. His sister died on 22 July 1938.

<doc id="286694" wikidata="Q2783829" url="?curid=286694" title="Leg before wicket">
<text>Leg before wicket (lbw) is one of the ways in which a batter can be dismissed in the sport of cricket. Following an appeal by the fielding side, the umpire may rule a batter out lbw if the ball would have struck the wicket but was instead intercepted by any part of the batsman&#x27;s body (except the hand(s) holding the bat). The umpire&#x27;s decision will depend on a number of criteria, including where the ball pitched, whether the ball hit in line with the wickets, the ball&#x27;s expected future trajectory after hitting the batsman, and whether the batsman was attempting to hit the ball.

Leg before wicket first appeared in the laws of cricket in 1774, as batsmen began to use their pads to prevent the ball from hitting their wicket. Over several years, refinements were made to clarify where the ball should pitch and to remove the element of interpreting the batsman&#x27;s intentions. The 1839 version of the law used a wording that remained in place for nearly 100 years. However, starting in the latter part of the 19th century, batsmen became increasingly expert at &quot;pad-play&quot; to reduce the risk of their dismissal. Following a number of failed proposals for reform, in 1935 the law was expanded, such that batters could be dismissed lbw even if the ball pitched outside the line of off stump. Critics felt this change made the game unattractive as it encouraged negative tactics at the expense of leg spin bowling.

After considerable debate and various experiments, the law was changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play, the new version, which is still in use, allowed batters to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit the ball with their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.

In his 1995 survey of cricket laws, Gerald Brodribb states: &quot;No dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw; it has caused trouble from its earliest days&quot;. Owing to its complexity, the law is widely misunderstood among the general public and has proven controversial among spectators, administrators and commentators; lbw decisions have sometimes caused crowd trouble. Since the law&#x27;s introduction, the proportion of lbw dismissals has risen steadily through the years.

==Definition==

The definition of leg before wicket (lbw) is currently Law 36 in the Laws of Cricket, written by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Before a batter can be dismissed lbw, the fielding team must appeal to the umpire. If the bowler delivers a no-ball — an illegal delivery — the batter cannot be out lbw under any circumstances. Otherwise, for the batter to be adjudged lbw, the ball, if it bounces, must pitch in line with or on the off side of the wickets. Then the ball must strike part of the batter&#x27;s body without first touching his/her bat, in line with the wickets and have been going on to hit the stumps. The batter may also be out lbw if, having made no attempt to hit the ball with their bat, they are struck outside the line of off stump by a ball that would have hit the wickets. The umpire must assume that the ball would have continued on the same trajectory after striking the batter, even if it would have bounced before hitting the stumps.

A batter can be out lbw even if the ball did not hit their leg: for example, a batter struck on the head could be lbw, although this situation is extremely rare. However, the batter cannot be lbw if the ball pitches on the leg side of the stumps (&quot;outside leg stump&quot;), even if the ball would have otherwise hit the wickets. Similarly, a batter who has attempted to hit the ball with their bat cannot be lbw if the ball strikes them outside the line of off stump. However, some shots in cricket, such as the switch hit or reverse sweep, involve the batter switching between a right- and left-handed stance; this affects the location of the off and leg side, which are determined by the stance. The law explicitly states that the off side is determined by the batter&#x27;s stance when the bowler commences their run-up.
According to MCC guidelines for umpires, factors to consider when giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. The umpire must also account for the height of the ball at impact and how far from the wicket the batter was standing; from this information they must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batter without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batter.

==Development of the law==

===Origins===
The earliest known written version of the Laws of Cricket, dating from 1744, does not include an lbw rule. At the time, batters in English cricket used curved bats, which made it unlikely that they would be able to stand directly in front of the wickets. However, a clause in the 1744 laws gave umpires the power to take action if the batter was &quot;standing unfair to strike&quot;. Cricket bats were modified to become straighter over the following years, allowing batters to stand closer to the wickets. Subsequently, some players deliberately began to obstruct the ball from hitting the wickets. Such tactics were criticised by writers and a revision of the laws in 1774 ruled that the batter was out if he deliberately stopped the ball from hitting the wicket with his leg. However, critics noted that the umpires were left the difficult task of interpreting the intentions of batters. The 1788 version of the laws no longer required the umpires to take account of the batter&#x27;s intent; now a batter was lbw if he stopped a ball that &quot;pitch[ed] straight&quot;. Further clarification of the law came in 1823, when a condition was added that &quot;the ball must be delivered in a straight line to the wicket&quot;. The ambiguity of the wording was highlighted when two prominent umpires disagreed over whether the ball had to travel in a straight line from the bowler to the wicket, or between the wickets at either end of the pitch. In 1839 the MCC, by then responsible for drafting the Laws of Cricket, endorsed the latter interpretation and ruled the batter out lbw if the ball pitched in between the wickets and would have hit the stumps.

===Controversy and attempted reform===

In essence, the lbw law remained the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batter to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batters used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batters began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery was not an easy one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.

Several proposals were made to prevent pad-play. At a meeting of representatives of the main county cricket clubs in 1888, one representative expressed the opinion that a &quot;batsman who defended his wicket with his body instead of with his bat should be punished&quot;. The representatives supported a motion to alter the law to state that the batters would be out if he stopped a ball that would have hit the wicket; in contrast to the existing wording, this took no account of where the ball pitched relative to the wickets. Further proposals included one in which the intent of the batter was taken into account, but no laws were changed and the MCC merely issued a condemnation of the practice of using pads for defence. This reduced pad-play for a short time, but when it increased again, a second pronouncement by the MCC had little effect.

Further discussion on altering the law took place in 1899, when several prominent cricketers supported an amendment similar to the 1888 proposal: the batter would be out if the ball would have hit the wicket, where it pitched was irrelevant. At a Special General Meeting of the MCC in 1902, Alfred Lyttelton formally proposed this amendment; the motion was supported by 259 votes to 188, but failed to secure the two-thirds majority required to change the laws. A. G. Steel was the principal opponent of the change, as he believed it would make the task of the umpires too difficult, but he later regretted his stance. Lyttelton&#x27;s brother, Robert, supported the alteration and campaigned for the rest of his life to have the lbw law altered. As evidence that pad-play was increasing and needed to be curtailed, he cited the growing number of wickets which were falling lbw: the proportion rose from 2% of dismissals in 1870 to 6% in 1890, and 12% in 1923. In 1902, the proposed new law was tried in the Minor Counties Championship, but deemed a failure. An increase in the size of the stumps was one of several other rejected proposals at this time to reduce the dominance of batters over bowlers.

===Alteration to the law===
Between 1900 and the 1930s, the number of runs scored by batters, and the proportion of lbw dismissals, continued to rise. Bowlers grew increasingly frustrated with pad-play and the extent to which batters refused to play shots at bowling directed outside the off stump, simply allowing it to pass by. The English fast bowler Harold Larwood responded by targeting leg stump, frequently hitting the batter with the ball in the process. This developed into the controversial Bodyline tactics he used against Australia in 1932–33. Some batters began to go further and preferred to kick away balls pitched outside off stump—reaching out to kick the ball instead of allowing it to hit their pads—if they presented any threat, knowing that they could not be dismissed lbw. The authorities believed these developments represented poor entertainment value. At the height of the Bodyline controversy in 1933, Donald Bradman, the leading Australian batter and primary target of the English bowlers, wrote to the MCC recommending an alteration of the lbw law to create more exciting games.
To address the problem, and redress the balance for bowlers, the MCC made some alterations to the laws. The size of the ball was reduced in 1927, and that of the stumps increased in 1931, but the changes had little effect. Between 1929 and 1933, county authorities conducted a trial in which a batter could be lbw if he had hit the ball onto his pads. Then, in 1935, an experimental law was introduced in which the batter could be dismissed lbw even if the ball pitched outside the line of off stump—in other words, a ball that turned or swung into the batter but did not pitch in line with the wickets. However, the ball was still required to strike the batter in line with the wickets. The umpire signalled to the scorers when he declared a batter out under the new rule, and any such dismissal was designated &quot;lbw (n)&quot; on the scorecard.

Several leading batters opposed the new law, including the professional Herbert Sutcliffe, known as an exponent of pad-play, and amateurs Errol Holmes and Bob Wyatt. &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; noted that these three improved their batting records during the 1935 season, but batters generally were less successful. There were also fewer drawn matches. There was an increase in the number of lbws— out of 1,560 lbw dismissals in first-class matches in 1935, 483 were given under the amended law. &quot;Wisden&quot; judged the experiment a success and several of its opponents changed their mind by the end of the season; batters soon became accustomed to the alteration. Although Australian authorities were less convinced, and did not immediately introduce the revision into domestic first-class cricket, in 1937 the new rule became part of the Laws of Cricket.

According to Gerald Brodribb, in his survey and history of the Laws, the change produced more &quot;enterprising&quot;, exciting cricket but any alteration in outlook was halted by the Second World War. When the sport resumed in 1946, batters were out of practice and the amended lbw law played into the hands of off spin and inswing bowlers, who began to dominate county cricket. The cricket historian Derek Birley notes that many of these bowlers imitated the methods of Alec Bedser, an inswing bowler who was successful immediately after the war, but that the resulting cricket was unexciting to watch. The revised lbw law, and other alterations in the game in favour of the bowler, further encouraged such bowling. The new law continued to provoke debate among writers and cricketers; many former players claimed that the alteration had caused a deterioration in batting and reduced the number of shots played on the off side. A 1963 report in &quot;The Times&quot; blamed the law for reducing the variety of bowling styles: &quot;the change has led to a steady increase in the amount of seam and off-spin bowling. Whereas in the early thirties every county had a leg spinner and an orthodox left arm spinner, leg spinners, at any rate, are now few and far between. Walk on to any of the first-class grounds at any time tomorrow and the chances are that you will see the wicketkeeper standing back and a medium pace bowler in action ... there is little doubt that the game, as a spectacle, is less attractive than it was.&quot; Several critics, including Bob Wyatt, maintained that the lbw law should be returned to its pre-1935 wording; he campaigned to do so until his death in 1995. On the other hand, Bradman, in the 1950s, proposed extending the law so that batters could be lbw even if they were struck outside the line of off stump. An MCC study of the state of cricket, carried out in 1956 and 1957, examined the prevalent and unpopular tactic involving off-spin and inswing bowlers aiming at leg stump with fielders concentrated on the leg side. Rather than alter the lbw law to combat the problem, the MCC reduced the number of fielders allowed on the leg side.

===Playing no stroke===
In the 1950s and 1960s, the amount of pad-play increased, owing to more difficult and unpredictable pitches that made batting much harder. Critics continued to regard this tactic as &quot;negative and unfair&quot;. In an effort to discourage pad-play and encourage leg spin bowling, a new variant of the lbw law was introduced, initially in Australia and the West Indies in the 1969–70 season, then in England for 1970. Under the re-worded law, a batter would be lbw if a ball destined to hit the stumps pitched in line with the wickets or &quot;outside a batter&#x27;s off stump and in the opinion of the umpire he made no genuine attempt to play the ball with his bat&quot;. This revision omitted the requirement that the impact should be in line with the wickets, but meant that any batter playing a shot could not be out if the ball pitched outside off stump, in contrast to the 1935 law. The editor of &quot;Wisden&quot; believed the change encouraged batters to take more risks, and had produced more attractive cricket. However, the proportion of wickets falling lbw sharply declined, and concerns were expressed in Australia. The Australian authorities proposed a reversion to the previous law. A batter could once more be out to a ball that pitched outside off stump, but a provision was added that &quot;if no stroke is offered to a ball pitching outside the off-stump which in the opinion of the umpire would hit the stumps, but hits the batter on any part of his person other than the hand, then the batter is out, even if that part of the person hit is not in line between wicket and wicket&quot;. The difference to the 1935 rule was that the batter could now be out even if the ball struck outside the line of off-stump. This wording was adopted throughout the world from 1972, although it was not yet part of the official Laws, and the percentage of lbws sharply increased to beyond the levels preceding the 1970 change. The MCC added the revised wording to the Laws of Cricket in 1980; this version of the lbw law is still used as of 2013.

===Effects of technology===
Since 1993, the proportion of lbws in each English season has risen steadily. According to cricket historian Douglas Miller, the percentage of lbw dismissals increased after broadcasters incorporated ball-tracking technology such as Hawk-Eye into their television coverage of matches. Miller writes: &quot;With the passage of time and the adoption of Hawkeye into other sports, together with presentations demonstrating its accuracy, cricket followers seem gradually to have accepted its predictions. Replay analyses have shown that a greater proportion of balls striking an outstretched leg go on to hit the wicket than had once been expected.&quot; He also suggests that umpires have been influenced by such evidence; their greater understanding of which deliveries are likely to hit the stumps has made them more likely to rule out batters who are standing further away from the stumps. This trend is replicated in international cricket, where the increasing use of technology in reviewing decisions has altered the attitude of umpires. Spin bowlers in particular win far more appeals for lbw. However, the use of on-field technology has proved controversial; some critics regard it as more reliable than human judgement, while others believe that the umpire is better placed to make the decision.

The International Cricket Council (ICC), responsible for running the game worldwide, conducted a trial in 2002 where lbw appeals could be referred to a match official, the third umpire, to review on television replays. The third umpire could only use technology to determine where the ball had pitched and if the batter hit the ball with his/her bat. The ICC judged the experiment unsuccessful and did not pursue it. More trials followed in 2006, although ball-tracking technology remained unavailable to match officials. After a further series of trials, in 2009 the Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) was brought into international cricket where teams could refer the on-field decisions of umpires to a third umpire who had access to television replays and technology such as ball tracking. According to the ICC&#x27;s general manager, Dave Richardson, DRS increased the frequency with which umpires awarded lbw decisions. In a 2012 interview, he said: &quot;Umpires may have realised that if they give someone out and DRS shows it was not out, then their decision can be rectified. So they might, I suppose, have the courage of their convictions a bit more and take a less conservative approach to giving the batter out. I think if we&#x27;re totally honest, DRS has affected the game slightly more than we thought it would.&quot;

Critics of the system suggest that rules for the use of DRS have created an inconsistency of approach to lbw decisions depending on the circumstances of the referral. Opponents also doubt that the ball-tracking technology used in deciding lbws is reliable enough, but the ICC state that tests have shown the system to be 100% accurate. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) initially declined to use DRS in matches involving India owing to their concerns regarding the ball-tracking technology. Early DRS trials were conducted during India matches, and several problems arose over lbws, particularly as the equipment was not as advanced as it later became. The BCCI believed the technology is unreliable and open to manipulation. However, as of 2016 they have accepted it.

==Trends and perception==

A study in 2011 by Douglas Miller shows that in English county cricket, the proportion of wickets to fall lbw has increased steadily since the First World War. In the 1920s, around 11% of wickets were lbw but this rose to 14% in the 1930s. Between 1946 and 1970, the proportion was approximately 11% but subsequently increased until reaching almost 19% in the decade before 2010. Miller also states that captains of county teams were statistically more likely to receive the benefit of lbw decisions—less likely to be out lbw when batting and more likely to dismiss batters lbw when bowling. For many years, county captains submitted end-of-match reports on the umpires; as umpires were professionals whose careers could be affected, captains consequently received leeway whether batting or bowling. Before 1963, when the status was abolished in county cricket, umpires were also more lenient towards amateur cricketers. Amateurs administered English cricket, and offending one could end an umpire&#x27;s career. Elsewhere in the world, lbws are more statistically likely in matches taking place on the Indian subcontinent. However, batters from the subcontinent were less likely to be lbw wherever they played in the world.

Teams that toured other countries often became frustrated by lbws given against them; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception have suggested that home batters are sometimes less likely than visiting batters to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success-rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points out that it is impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location.

Among those who do not follow cricket, the law has the reputation of being extremely difficult to understand, of equivalent complexity to association football&#x27;s offside rule. Owing to the difficulty of its interpretation, lbw is regarded by critics as the most controversial of the laws but also a yardstick by which an umpire&#x27;s abilities are judged. In his book &quot;Cricket and the Law: The Man in White Is Always Right&quot;, David Fraser writes that umpires&#x27; lbw decisions are frequently criticised and &quot;arguments about bias and incompetence in adjudication inform almost every discussion about lbw decisions&quot;. Problems arise because the umpire has not only to establish what has happened but also to speculate over what might have occurred. Controversial aspects of lbw decisions include the umpire having to determine whether the ball pitched outside leg stump, and in certain circumstances whether the batter intended to hit the ball or leave it alone. Umpires are frequently criticised for their lbw decisions by players, commentators and spectators. Historically, trouble ranging from protests and arguments to crowd demonstrations occasionally arose from disputed decisions. For example, a prolonged crowd disturbance, in which items were thrown onto the playing field and the match was delayed, took place when Mohammad Azharuddin was adjudged lbw during a 1996 One Day International in India.

<text>The Major League Soccer All-Star Game is an annual soccer game held by Major League Soccer featuring selected players from the league against an international club or selected players from another league. MLS initially adopted a traditional all-star game format used by other North American sports leagues where the Eastern Conference squared off against the Western Conference. This eventually evolved into the current system where the league annually invites a club from abroad to play against a league all-star team in a friendly match. The MLS All-Stars hold a 9–8 record in the competition, which generally marks the season&#x27;s midpoint. Players are awarded roster spots through a combination of fan voting and selections by the appointed manager and league commissioner.

In case of a tie after full-time, the game does not use a 30-minute extra time period; instead it goes straight to a penalty shoot-out. The match is preceded by a skills challenge tournament, which was introduced in 2018 and features three-player teams competing in various events. The All-Star Game also runs parallel to the MLS Next All-Star Game, which debuted in 2014 as the Homegrown Game.

==History==
Major League Soccer&#x27;s first all-star game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996. The game, using an East–West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs to emulate other American leagues, was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazil national team defeating a team of FIFA World All-Stars. The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats. The 1998 All-Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad. The 2002 game, the first to use a league-wide all-star team, was the only game to feature a national team opponent.

Since then (except in 2004), every opponent has been a foreign club invited by the league. The MLS All-Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009. All games from 2005 to 2019 have been against teams from Europe, the majority of which have been from England&#x27;s Premier League. The European league schedule runs from fall to spring, allowing for a fixture against the MLS All-Stars during the preseasons of teams. The 2020 All-Star Game was to be the first to feature the all-star team from another league, Liga MX; however, that game was cancelled.

In August 2005, an 18-player all-star team squad named the &quot;MLS Select Team&quot; competed in the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu, a friendly hosted by Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. The All-Star team, coached by Steve Nicol, lost 5–0 after being given only two days to prepare between normal league matches.

The roster is chosen using a mix of fan votes, nominations from the coach, and commissioner&#x27;s pick. Some players, including English midfielders Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard in 2015, have been picked to participate in the All-Star Game despite not playing in club matches. Players who are picked to play in the All-Star Game but refuse to join the team are suspended from one league match.

==Roster==
For 2014, ten players were chosen by All-Star Game coach Caleb Porter, eleven players were chosen by fan voting (subject to Porter&#x27;s approval), and two were selected by MLS commissioner Don Garber.

==Skills Challenge==

The modern incarnation of the MLS All-Star Skills Challenge, introduced in 2018, is a freestyle soccer event that features three-player teams competing against each other in minigames, including a touch-and-volley goal showcase, a shooting accuracy competition, and a passing-and-shooting challenge. The older version of the skills challenge was retired in 2001 and featured other events, including &quot;goalie wars&quot; and soccer tennis.

Since 2023, rights for the MLS All-Star Game have been held by Apple TV+. The match and associated events are broadcast in English, French, and Spanish on MLS Season Pass; the 2023 edition was made free to stream.

The U.S. broadcast in English alternated between ESPN and Fox from 2015 to 2022, with the networks also alternating the MLS Cup. In even numbered years, ESPN has broadcast the All-Star Game while Fox would broadcast the MLS Cup. Likewise, in odd numbered years, Fox would be slated to broadcast the All-Star Game while ESPN or its sister network, ABC beginning in 2019, would broadcast the MLS Cup.

<doc id="286698" wikidata="Q5377953" url="?curid=286698" title="England, Half-English">
<text>England, Half-English is a 2002 album by English political singer-songwriter Billy Bragg and the Blokes.

The title track is about racism in England and the anti-immigration feelings and racist abuse of asylum seekers fuelled by the tabloid press, particularly the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. The song uses examples such as the lions on the English football team&#x27;s shirts, Britannia and the English patron saint, St. George (from Lebanon), the hyphen in Anglo-Saxon and the nation&#x27;s favourite dish (curry) to convey his message that everything about English culture is shaped and influenced by the waves of immigration that have taken place in the past.

The title is taken from &quot;England, Half English&quot;, a 1961 collection of essays and articles by Colin MacInnes, which includes a 1957 article called &quot;Young England, Half English&quot; about the influence of American pop music on English teenagers.

The album peaked at number 51 on the UK Albums Chart in March 2002. Its first single, the double A-side &quot;England, Half English&quot; / &quot;St. Monday&quot;, reached number 98 on the UK singles chart the same month. &quot;Take Down the Union Jack&quot;, a song from the album that protests against the monarchy, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Golden Jubilee and argues for English and Scottish independence, reached number 22 in the UK Singles Chart in May 2002.

<text>The Three Californias Trilogy (also known as the Wild Shore Triptych and the Orange County Trilogy) is a book by Kim Stanley Robinson, which depict three different possible futures of Orange County, California. The books that make up the trilogy are &quot;The Wild Shore&quot;, &quot;The Gold Coast&quot; and &quot;Pacific Edge&quot;. Each of these books describes the life of young people in the three different near-futures. All three novels begin with an exposition which tells the reader about the world they are entering.

==Summaries==

===&quot;The Wild Shore&quot;===
&quot;The Wild Shore&quot; was Robinson&#x27;s first published novel. &quot;The Wild Shore&quot; (1984) is the story of survivors of a nuclear war. The nuclear strike consisted of 2,000–3,000 neutron bombs that were detonated in 2,000 of North America&#x27;s biggest cities in 1987. Survivors have started over, forming villages and living off agriculture and sea. The theme of the first chapters is that of a quite normal pastoral science fiction, which is deconstructed in later chapters. Post-nuclear rural life is hindered from developing further by international treaties imposed by the victorious Soviets, with an unwilling Japan charged with patrolling the West Coast.

&quot;The Wild Shore&quot; won the Locus Award for Best First Novel in 1985 and was nominated for both the Nebula and Philip K. Dick Awards in 1984. Algis Budrys described it as &quot;a frontier novel, with rich threads of Steinbeckian populism woven into its cast of characters.&quot; Although faulting the novel&#x27;s &quot;failure to sustain the weight of its undertakings,&quot; he concluded that &quot;Wild Shore&quot; was &quot;a remarkably powerful piece of work, still a good book, almost without doubt a harbinger of great books to come from Robinson. It is also a really interesting and good book.&quot;

===&quot;The Gold Coast&quot;===
In &quot;The Gold Coast&quot; (1988) the reader learns about Southern California in 2027, a dystopian extension of the 1980s&#x27; Los Angeles and car oriented culture and life-style: &quot;an endless sprawl of condos, freeways and malls.&quot; The book follows two groups of characters, connected by 27 year-old Jim McPherson and his father Dennis.

&quot;The Gold Coast&quot; was nominated for the Campbell, Locus, and British Science Fiction award in 1989.

===&quot;Pacific Edge&quot;===
&quot;Pacific Edge&quot; (1990), set in the El Modena neighborhood of Orange in 2065, narrates a summer in the life of Kevin Clayborne, a young house renovator recently elected for the town council of El Modena. Kevin finds himself at odds with the town mayor, Alfredo Blair, both personally and professionally. On the personal side, both Kevin and Alfredo are vying for the affection of Ramona Alvarez, Alfredo&#x27;s former long-term girlfriend. On the professional side, Alfredo has been influenced by corporate money and attempts to rezone the last virgin hill inside the town for a commercial development. Kevin loses in all accounts: After attempting a relationship with Kevin, Ramona comes back to Alfredo, and the rezoning of the hill is passed by the council and by a town vote. In a last attempt to save the hill, Kevin turns it into a memorial for his recently deceased grandfather, who was a pillar of the community. This makes the commercial development on the hill an unpalatable project for the town. At the end of the novel, Kevin attends Ramona and Alfredo&#x27;s wedding, and mourns what he&#x27;s lost and reflects on what he&#x27;s achieved.

&quot;Pacific Edge&quot; was the winner of the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1991.

==Development history==
In an interview with UCSD, Robinson said that &quot;this was one of my few original ideas&quot; and that he came up with the idea for the novels while still at UCSD on a drive to Orange County, California to visit his parents.

<text>Coral World is a marine park and tourist attraction located next to Coki Beach on the East End of St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.

==Facilities and attractions==
Since its opening in 1978, the park has featured a signature Underwater Observatory Tower. The tower descends in the ocean to allow underwater viewing. Later additions to the park include an circular Caribbean Reef Encounter tank, which houses local fish and other sea life, and an enclosure for South American sea lions. The park uses an open-water system to circulate ocean water through the exhibits.

Other park animals include sea turtles, stingrays, juvenile sharks, seahorses, sea stars, conch, sea cucumbers, iguanas, and lorikeets. Many of the animals, such as the turtles, are rescued from the wild and released when possible.

The park focuses on visitor education and interaction with the animals, through touch encounters, feedings, swims, snuba, and Sea Trek.

==History==
Coral World opened in 1978, as Coral World International&#x27;s second marine park, following Coral World Underwater Observatory in Eilat, Israel.

In 1989 it was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo.

In 1995 another storm, Hurricane Marilyn, destroyed the observatory and other tanks. Coral World was sold to new owners more than a year later.

During the 1990s, Coral World hired former world boxing champion Julian Jackson as a celebrity tour guide, to attract more tourists to the park.

In 2007 the park added sea lions.

In 2012 Coral World proposed adding a controversial dolphin swim attraction.

In 2017 Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria caused an estimed $2 million in damage to the park.

In 2018 Coral World began construction of an in-ocean dolphinarium.

<text>Ernest William Callenbach (April 3, 1929 – April 16, 2012) was an American author, film critic, editor, and simple living adherent. Having many connections with a group of noted creative individuals in Northern California, Callenbach&#x27;s influence beyond the region began with the publication of his utopian novel &quot;Ecotopia&quot; in 1975.

== Life and work ==
Born into a farming family in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Callenbach attended the University of Chicago, where he was drawn into the then &#x27;new wave&#x27; of serious attention to film as an art form. After six months in Paris at the Sorbonne, watching four films a day, he returned to Chicago and earned a master&#x27;s degree in English and Communications.

Callenbach then moved to California. From 1955 to 1991, he was on the staff of the University of California Press (Berkeley). A general copywriter for a number of years, he edited the Press&#x27;s &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; from 1958 until 1991. He also occasionally taught film courses at U.C. and at San Francisco State University.

For many years Callenbach edited the Natural History Guides at the U.C. Press. He began to take environmental issues and their connections to human value systems, social patterns, and lifestyles just as seriously as he had taken film. He was heavily influenced by Edward Abbey. Callenbach talked publicly about being influenced, during work on his novel &quot;Ecotopia&quot;, by numerous streams of thought: scientific discoveries in the fields of ecology and conservation biology; the urban-ecology planning movement, concerned with an approach to urban planning; and the soft-energy movement, championed by Amory Lovins and others.

Callenbach is known as an author of green books, namely as author of the ecological &quot;utopias&quot; &quot;Ecotopia&quot; (1975) and &quot;Ecotopia Emerging&quot; (1981), and also &quot;The Ecotopian Encyclopedia&quot; (1981), &quot;Bring Back the Buffalo!&quot; (1995), and &quot;Ecology: A Pocket Guide&quot; (1998). (While his first novel popularized the term &quot;ecotopia,&quot; the term was actually coined by the ethnographer E. N. Anderson.)

In terms of concepts of human involvement with the ecology, as well as some of the economic and social concepts, the Ecotopia books are related to what is known as the sustainability movement. Callenbach&#x27;s Ecotopian concept is not &quot;Luddite&quot; — he does not reject high technology, but rather his fictional society shows a &quot;conscious selectivity&quot; about technology. In Ecotopia ecologically compatible high-technology exists alongside postmaterialistic attitudes and lifestyles. As an example, with its emphasis on personal rather than impersonal interaction, Callenbach&#x27;s Ecotopian society anticipates the development and liberal usage of videoconferencing.

Indeed, for all his involvement with print publishing, Callenbach remained quite interested in visual media. Aspects of his book &quot;Ecotopia&quot; in some ways anticipated C-SPAN — which came into being a few years later — because in the story the daily life of the legislature and some of that of the judicial courts is televised in this fictional society, and televised debates (including technical debates concerning ecological problems) meet a need and desire among citizens.

Callenbach was a part of the circle of West Coast technologists, architects, social thinkers, and scientists which included Ursula K. Le Guin, Sim Van der Ryn, Peter Calthorpe, Stewart Brand, Kevin Kelly, J. Baldwin, and John Todd. As with some of these others, he was often a speaker, discussion panellist, and essayist.

In 2006 Callenbach introduced the story of a real-world community movement in Japan that is reminiscent, in its aims and practices, of his Ecotopian society. He visited Japan and investigated the Yamagishi movement. He found that it encompassed some three dozen intentional communities founded on the same underlying principles: living an ecologically based integration of people with agriculture (pig, cattle, and chicken livestock raising, and organic-vegetable and fruit farming), and living a social life based on principles of democracy, mutual understanding, support, and health. Each individual settlement is referred to as &quot;jikkenji&quot; (&#x27;demonstration community for the world&#x27;).

In 2009, Callenbach was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Freiburg. Freiburg is noted for its renewable energy industry and has been called a &quot;green utopia&quot;. He died of cancer on April 16, 2012, in Berkeley, California.

<doc id="286738" wikidata="Q18558978" url="?curid=286738" title="Berserk (manga)">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe–inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the &quot;Band of the Hawk&quot;. The series follows Guts&#x27; journey seeking revenge on Griffith, who betrayed him and sacrificed his comrades to become a powerful demonic being.

Miura premiered a prototype of &quot;Berserk&quot; in 1988. The series began the following year in Hakusensha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;&quot;, which was replaced in 1992 by the semimonthly magazine &quot;Young Animal&quot;, where &quot;Berserk&quot; has continued its publication. Following Miura&#x27;s death in May 2021, the final chapter that he worked on was published posthumously in September of the same year; the series resumed in June 2022, under supervision of Miura&#x27;s fellow manga artist and childhood friend and Miura&#x27;s group of assistants and apprentices from Studio Gaga.

&quot;Berserk&quot; was adapted into a 25-episode anime television series by OLM, which covered the Golden Age story arc, and was broadcast from October 1997 to March 1998. The Golden Age arc was also adapted into a ; the first two films premiered in 2012 and the third film premiered in 2013. A second 24-episode anime television series adaptation was broadcast for two seasons in 2016 and 2017.

By September 2023, the &quot;Berserk&quot; manga had over 60 million copies in circulation, including digital versions, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It received the Award for Excellence at the sixth installment of the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2002. &quot;Berserk&quot; has been widely acclaimed, particularly for its dark setting, storytelling, characters, and Miura&#x27;s detailed artwork.

==Plot==

Guts was born from the hanged corpse of his mother and raised as a mercenary by his abusive adoptive father, Gambino, following the death of his adoptive mother, Shisu. After being forced to kill Gambino in self-defense, Guts fled his mercenary group and became a wandering mercenary. His reckless yet powerful fighting style attracts the attention of Griffith, the leader of a mercenary group called the Band of the Hawk, which he makes Guts join after defeating him. The kingdom of Midland hires the Band to aid them in their war against the Chuder Empire, and Guts learns of Griffith&#x27;s desire to rule his own kingdom and of the pendant he possesses, called the Behelit. After the demonic warrior Nosferatu Zodd spares them, he warns Guts that he will die for being Griffith&#x27;s friend.

As Griffith befriends Midland&#x27;s nobility and the king&#x27;s daughter, Charlotte, Guts begins to develop feelings for Casca, another Hawks commander and the only female member. After overhearing Griffith confess to Charlotte that he only considers someone with their own dream as a friend, Guts decides to leave the group to find his own dream, a decision that Griffith refuses unless Guts defeats him in a duel. When Guts wins, Griffith descends into a downward spiral that culminates in his arrest after he seduces Charlotte. He loses the Behelit while being subjected to torture, and the Midland army declares the Hawks to be outlaws. Soon after, a mysterious being known as the Skull Knight warns Guts that his actions have triggered an Eclipse and, after learning of the Hawks&#x27; predicament, he rejoins them to rescue Griffith. At this time, he and Casca consummate their feelings for each other.

After rescuing Griffith, the Hawks learn that his torture has left him incapable of leading them. When Griffith regains his Behelit, it uses his blood to initiate the Eclipse, a convergence of the physical and astral realms. During the Eclipse, the Hawks encounter a quartet of archdemons known as the Godhand, who reveal that Griffith has been chosen as their fifth member and can only do so if he sacrifices his comrades, which he accepts. After being branded with sigils that mark them for sacrifice, the Hawks are slaughtered by the Godhand&#x27;s Apostles—former humans turned demons who like Zodd, gained power by sacrificing their loved ones—and only Guts and Casca survive. Griffith, who has become the fifth Godhand, Femto, rapes Casca, and Guts loses his left forearm and right eye while trying to save her; although the Skull Knight rescues them, the ordeal traumatizes Casca. After learning from the Skull Knight that the Brands of Sacrifice make them targets for beings of darkness, Guts leaves Casca in the care of the blacksmith Godo, his adoptive daughter Erica, and Rickert, the youngest member of the Band of the Hawk, who survived because he was not present at the Eclipse. After Godo gives Guts a new sword, Dragonslayer, and Rickert gives him a prosthetic left arm, Guts begins hunting the Apostles in search of the God Hand while being pursued by a demonic phantom, the Demon Child, which is in fact his and Casca&#x27;s unborn child that became deformed after Femto raped her.

Two years later, having killed many Apostles and becoming known as the Black Swordsman, Guts is joined by the elf Puck, and is captured by Farnese, the captain of the Holy See Church&#x27;s Holy Iron Chain Knights, who believes that Guts is a harbinger of the apocalypse. Guts escapes after saving Farnese and returns home to Godo, where he learns that Casca has wandered off. His search for her takes him to the ruined city of St. Albion, which the God Hand have prepared as the site for a ceremony to give one of their own a physical form and which has become a refuge for refugees fleeing the invading Kushan Empire&#x27;s armies. Guts saves Casca from the Holy See bishop Mozgus as the souls of the dead attack the city, creating a massive Brand of Sacrifice, and is joined by Farnese, her bodyguard Serpico, and the young thief Isidro. Meanwhile, an Apostle living under St. Albion consumes the Demon Child and uses its body to restore Griffith to physical form.

After Guts fights Griffith and Zodd at Godo&#x27;s home, Griffith realizes that some traces of the Demon Infant remain within him. Hoping to find a land safe from the demons and potentially heal Casca, Guts decides to travel with Casca to Puck&#x27;s homeland of Elfhelm on the island of Skellig, allowing Isidro, Farnese, and Serpico to follow him out of fear that he will lose control of himself to his dark impulses, which are embodied as the Beast of Darkness within his mind, with Farnese becoming Casca&#x27;s primary caretaker. Meanwhile, Griffith forms a second Band of the Hawk with Zodd and other Apostles to save Midland from the Kushan Empire, which is led by emperor Ganishka, a rogue Apostle.

Guts&#x27; party encounters the witch Flora, her apprentice Schierke and the elf Ivalera while saving a village from trolls, and Flora gives him the Berserker Armor, which increases his power but risks pushing his body beyond its limits and being consumed by his inner darkness. Flora is later killed by Apostles, and after escaping, Guts&#x27; party encounters a mysterious being they dub the Moonlight Child, who expresses affection for Guts and Casca before disappearing after the full moon passes. Meanwhile, the Skull Knight warns Guts to not abuse the Berserker Armor&#x27;s power while assuring him that Elfhelm&#x27;s inhabitants can heal Casca&#x27;s mind. While Guts and his party secure a ship called the &quot;Seahorse&quot;, which is captained by Farnese&#x27;s fiance, Prince Roderick, to reach Elfhelm in the wake of a Kushan attack on the port city in which Guts and Zodd briefly ally to fight Ganishka in his Apostle form, Ganishka transforms into an eldritch monstrosity and causes the physical and astral realms to merge after being slain by Griffith. With the blessing of Charlotte and the Holy See, Griffith establishes the city of Falconia to provide refuge for humanity from the creatures that manifested after the realms merged.

After recruiting a merrow girl named Isma, Guts&#x27; party reaches Elfhelm; its elf ruler, Danann, helps Farnese and Schierke in their magical training, and succeeds in restoring Casca&#x27;s mind. The Skull Knight introduces Guts to the creator of the Berserker Armor and reveals his past with the Godhand and its leader, Void. The Moonlight Child later reappears; it is revealed that he is the Demon Child, who can take control of Griffith&#x27;s host during a full moon. Griffith regains control of his host and abducts Casca while destroying the island&#x27;s spirit tree, unleashing spirits that attack the island and cause Danann, Isma, and the other magical creatures (except for Puck and Ivalera) to disappear into the astral realm. As the survivors flee on the Seahorse, Guts breaks down in despair. Griffith returns to the mainland with Casca, imprisoning her in Falconia in a fugue until she remembers her companions and attempts to escape, only to lose consciousness upon recapture. Guts is taunted by visions of his inner darkness that urge him to give in, but he passes out as Kushan warriors invade the ship and are revealed to be under the command of Silat, the leader of the Bakiraka warrior clan who Guts had previously fought, and Daiba, a magician and former servant of Ganishka. Among the soldiers is Rickert, who had escaped from Falconia along with Erica and the Kushan deserters.

The Kushan escort Guts and the rest of the party to their capital where Guts is imprisoned as a precaution. Daiba informs them that Falconia&#x27;s army has appeared on the borders of the Kushan Empire and that the attack on Elfhelm is part of a wider campaign by Falconia to have Griffith rule the world. Daiba, therefore, orders that Guts and his party, Rodrick, the ships&#x27; crew, and Elfhelm&#x27;s surviving sorcerers be placed under his command as the empire prepares for war with Falconia. As they adjust to life in the Kushan capital, Schierke remains unconscious and Guts remains imprisoned, Rodrick attends the kurultai, a meeting of the ruling Kushan clans called by the new emperor as a guest, alongside Silat and Daiba. There, Daiba informs the emperor of his experiences in Falconia, Silat asks the emperor to lead the army against Griffith. This is interrupted when Rakshas, a Kushan Apostle in the New Band of the Hawk, appears from the body of a Kushan lord. Rakshas then summons an army of trolls who start attacking the city. Asking Daiba to help him telepathically contact the populous, Silat rallies them to fight while Farnese uses magic to bathe the city in light. This causes Rakshas, who draws their power from the dark, to flee with Silat in pursuit. Seeking darkness, Rakshas finds Guts in his cell who willingly accepts death before Silat catches up and kills Rakshas. While the city reels from the attack, it is revealed that Schierke is using astral projection to scout out Falconia in search of Casca.

==Production==
===Development===
While briefly working as an assistant to George Morikawa at 18, Miura had already planned some ideas for &quot;Berserk&quot;″s development, having a dark warrior with a gigantic sword illustrated in his portfolio who would be the first conception of Guts. Miura submitted manuscripts to a manga magazine for about four years before working for Hakusensha; however, he felt that he was not capable enough for it and they were also not interested in publishing science fiction or fantasy works. In 1988, while working with Buronson on a manga titled &quot;King of Wolves&quot;, Miura published a prototype of &quot;Berserk&quot; in Hakusensha&#x27;s &quot;Gekkan ComiComi&quot;. This 48-page prototype placed second at the seventh &quot;ComiComi&quot;″s Manga-School prize. He later submitted his work to a magazine that, at the time, &quot;was on the verge of going under,&quot; and he was switched around between several editors before meeting his first editor. The serialization of &quot;Berserk&quot; began in Hakusensha&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in 1989. Miura commented that he landed the serial as soon as he made his debut, so he never had the opportunity to receive much criticism from editors.

===Concept and influences===
Miura stated that the inspiration for the series&#x27; title was diffuse at the time of creation. He did not have information about the berserkers or the Berserker Armor (which first appeared in the 222nd chapter) planned out from the start. He chose the word, telling himself that &quot;its mysterious aspect would stick well.&quot; Miura said that the title was connected to Guts&#x27; imagery, influenced by &quot;Mad Max&quot;, further elaborating, &quot;In short, starting from a world with a dark hero who is burning for revenge, prompts you to imagine a rabid character. When, guided by his anger, he will pour out this rage on overpowered enemies, we must insist on his fanaticism if you want to stay consistent. That&#x27;s why I thought &quot;Berserk&quot; would make a perfect title to represent my universe.&quot; According to Miura, the series&#x27; dark fantasy setting was inspired by the 1982 film &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; and the &quot;Elric of Melniboné&quot; series. Miura stated that he did not see dark fantasy as a genre in itself, but rather as an equivalent of general fantasy. He commented that outside of Japan the big works of fantasy, like &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, contain dark elements, and in Japan, the fantasy genre was popularized by video games like &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, which were aimed at children, and therefore, expurgated the dark elements, but since he received the influence from novels before that of those games, Miura &quot;naturally turned to dark fantasy.&quot;

Miura said that &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, by Buronson and Tetsuo Hara, was the work that had the greatest impact on his own work, helping as well to develop his art style. Miura also mentioned animator and manga artist Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and manga artist Fujihiko Hosono as early influences to his art style. &quot;Violence Jack&quot; by Go Nagai and &quot;Guin Saga&quot; by Kaoru Kurimoto inspired the series&#x27; story and atmosphere. &quot;&quot; by Masatoshi Uchizaki served him as a reference for his backgrounds. Miura said that his favorite manga series was &quot;Dororo&quot; by Osamu Tezuka, and that he wanted to create a fantasy work that possessed dark, &quot;muddy&quot; and -like elements. Miura stated that he learned the basics of storytelling from George Lucas, creator of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, and called the eponymous 1977 film his favorite work. Miura commented about the influence of manga on the series, stating that it is about &quot;expressing every feeling powerfully.&quot; Particularly, he mentioned influence from Yumiko Ōshima, and that the anime adaptations of &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; and &quot;Aim for the Ace!&quot;, both directed by Osamu Dezaki, inspired him to read &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; manga and the works of Keiko Takemiya, mainly &quot;Kaze to Ki no Uta&quot;.

Some aspects of Guts (personality and design) were partially inspired by Miura&#x27;s highschool friend and later fellow manga artist , by &quot;Mad Max&quot;″s Max Rockatansky, and by Rutger Hauer&#x27;s performances in &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;The Hitcher&quot; and &quot;The Blood of Heroes&quot;. Guts&#x27; prosthetic hand was inspired by &quot;Dororo&quot;″s Hyakkimaru, and &quot;Cobra&quot;″s eponymous protagonist. Kurt, the protagonist of &quot;&quot;, by Shinji Wada, and an illustration of a giant wielding a sword, featured in &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; (&quot;Guin Saga&quot; spin-off), inspired the size of Guts&#x27; sword, the Dragon Slayer, by mixing both characters&#x27; swords. Miura commented that when drawing the Dragon Slayer, he wanted to emulate the effect of Kenshiro&#x27;s or Raoh&#x27;s (&quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;) fist &quot;flying out from the page,&quot; but he felt that Guts&#x27; sword did not have the same feeling of weight as a fist. He wanted to convey an &quot;extension of reality&quot; feel to the sword, similar to the depiction of the &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;″s Hokuto Shinken martial art, and make it believable for the readers. Miura stated that &quot;Black Swordsman&quot; Guts was the first thing he was set on, but he did not have any idea about what his backstory would be. He focused on the character development up until around the third or fourth volume and then he would think about what brought him to revenge.

===Frequency===
&quot;Berserk&quot; is known for its frequent and often extended hiatuses, which date back to late 2006. Following a pause, three consecutive chapters about Guts&#x27; childhood were published from June 8 to July 13, 2012; the main storyline resumed eight months later on October 12, and the series went on hiatus after a chapter published on December 28 of the same year. Miura took a break to work on his six-chapter mini-series &quot;Giganto Maxia&quot;, and &quot;Berserk&quot; was published intermittently from April 11 to September 26, 2014. After a 10-month hiatus, the manga resumed on July 24, 2015, and was published monthly until November 27 of the same year, before entering on hiatus. It was published monthly from June 24 to September 23, 2016, before entering another hiatus. The manga resumed publication from March 24 to June 23, 2017, and was then published on a monthly basis from December 22 of the same year to May 25, 2018. Four months later, another chapter was published on August 24, 2018, before entering an eight-month hiatus. Two chapters were published on April 26 and August 23, 2019. Three chapters were published on April 24, July 22, and October 23, 2020, respectively. The last chapter published in Miura&#x27;s lifetime was released on January 22, 2021.

===Miura&#x27;s death and series resumption===
On May 20, 2021, Hakusensha announced that Miura died at 54 due to an acute aortic dissection on May 6, leaving it undecided what would happen to the series. The posthumous 364th chapter of &quot;Berserk&quot; was published in &quot;Young Animal&quot; on September 10 of the same year, which was Miura&#x27;s last work, and members of Miura&#x27;s Studio Gaga, which consisted of him and his group of assistants and apprentices, worked to finish the manuscript of the chapter. The magazine&#x27;s issue was a memorial to Miura, featuring a special &quot;Messages to Kentarou Miura&quot; booklet and a poster of &quot;famous scenes&quot; from the manga. In the same issue, Hakusensha stated that the future of the series remained uncertain and that the staff&#x27;s priority would &quot;always be placed on him—what he would think if he were still with us.&quot; The afterword in the manga&#x27;s 41st volume (released in December 2021) from &quot;Young Animal&quot;″s editorial staff stated that the future of the manga was still undecided.

On June 7, 2022, Hakusensha and announced that the series would continue publication, using plans and thoughts that were relayed to Mori by Miura himself, as well as memorandums and character designs that Miura left behind. Mori related how he had visited Miura nearly 30 years ago when the latter was drawing &quot;the Eclipse&quot; event of &quot;Berserk&quot; and how his friend completed the storyline for the manga up to its last chapter that week. Mori explained that the story for &quot;Berserk&quot; had since gone on &quot;exactly as we discussed at the time, with almost no changes.&quot; As the only person who knows the ending Miura intended, Mori agreed to continue the series and promised, &quot;I will only write the episodes that Miura talked to me about. I will not flesh it out. I will not write episodes that I don&#x27;t remember clearly. I will only write the lines and stories that Miura described to me.&quot;

In a 2023 interview, on the occasion of the 42nd volume release, Mori commented that Miura &quot;was a manga genius bursting with talent,&quot; and that &quot;[h]e had an eagerness to see things through to the end as well as an outstanding ability to paint, conceive stories and employ narrative devices effectively.&quot; For this reason, Mori initially concluded that it would be impossible to keep the series going without Miura, but he changed his mind after meeting with the members of Studio Gaga, who had worked under Miura, to perfect the unfinished last &quot;Berserk&quot; chapter that Miura had worked on. Mori recalled thinking, &quot;The thought that Miura would be mad at me doing nothing motivated me to reach a decision.&quot; About his taking over from Miura in connection with the series, Mori stated that he still had mixed feelings, &quot;It may be unforgivable for me to do it, now that Miura is no longer here,&quot; reiterating as well, &quot;I will never add my own twist. I will simply remember and convey what Miura told me.&quot;

&quot;Berserk&quot; has continued with the credits appearing as &quot;original work by Kentaro Miura, art by Studio Gaga, supervised by Kouji Mori&quot;. The &quot;Fantasia Arc/Elf Island Chapter&quot; finished with chapters released from June 24, 2022, to May 26, 2023; a new story arc started on September 22 of the same year.

==Themes==
&quot;Berserk&quot; explores a wide range of themes and topics. Free will, destiny, and causality are discussed within the series. Human resilience is a recurring theme, with many characters coming from traumatic backgrounds, constantly struggling against an unjust world. Guts struggles with destiny itself and is constantly resisting the pull of predetermination. Griffith also embodies this idea of resilience, by chasing his dream of ruling his own kingdom, despite his lowborn origins, as well as free will, by his own decision to sacrifice the Band of the Hawk in order to achieve his dream.

The series also explores human nature and morality, as characters struggle between becoming good human beings or falling into madness and evil. Guts, at the beginning of the story, is presented as an antihero who does not care about killing and is indifferent to people who aid him. Guts does not act in accordance with definitions of right and wrong, he operates within a gray area. Initially he does not attempt to be heroic or protect the innocent, though his self-motivated actions sometimes do so incidentally. However, as the story progresses, it is shown that he is in fact a person who is deeply conflicted internally. His tragic and traumatic past, unfolded in the Golden Age arc, shows Guts as a more complex character. Anne Lauenroth of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; wrote that Griffith is &quot;not evil at all,&quot; but &quot;arrogant and brutally realistic about human nature.&quot; The suppression of his own human nature would initiate his demise as the Hawk and the rise of Femto.

Friendship, comradery and human relations are other explored themes. As a child, Guts tried to build some level of friendship with his mercenary group, but due to his traumatic experience with them, he lost trust in people. However, through the time he was with Griffith and the rest of the Band of the Hawk, Guts formed bonds, friendships, animosities and co-dependencies, maturing as well as individual. Miura stated that he based the Band of the Hawk on his own high school friend relationship experience. Specifically, he mentioned that his friendship with later fellow manga artist Kouji Mori partially inspired the relationship between Guts and Griffith. Jacob Chapman of &quot;Anime News Network&quot;, wrote that through their friendship, Guts&#x27; ambitions were elevated and Griffith&#x27;s were lowered, allowing both of them to consider a new future for the first time, one where they fight side by side as equals and die on the battlefield, but they reject this future out of their own personal fears, as Guts did not think he was &quot;good enough&quot; for a happy future and Griffith was terrified of his lofty dream crumbling into something more mundane. Miura also said that the conflict between Guts and Griffith speaks about their change after having built their personalities.

The Golden Age arc has been compared to a Greek tragedy. According to Lauenroth, Griffith&#x27;s lies in how he compartmentalizes his feelings of guilt and shame that would get in the way of his dream and how he deals to repress them. His inner dialogue in his second duel with Guts, &quot;If I can&#x27;t have him, I don&#x27;t care,&quot; marks the Golden Age arc peripeteia. When Guts comes running to rescue him during the Eclipse, Griffith reaches his moment of anagnorisis with his thought, &quot;You&#x27;re the only one... who made me forget my dream.&quot;

Betrayal and revenge are major themes in the series. Guts suffered his first betrayal when Gambino sold Guts&#x27; body to another soldier for a few coins. He would eventually take revenge against the soldier, killing him on the battlefield, and he later would kill Gambino as well. Guts is in a quest for revenge after his comrades were betrayed by Griffith and sacrificed by the God Hand. This desire for vengeance has been his main reason of survival.

Religion has been also touched in the series, mainly through the characters of Mozgus and Farnese. Miura stated that he created Mozgus based on the concept of rigid personality to create a religious fanatic character with no flexibility. Farnese is presented as the figurehead of the Holy Iron Chain Knights, inquisitors tasked with burning heretics and witches at the stake. After her encounter with Guts, she finds it increasingly difficult to resolve her faith with the atrocities she became party to, as Guts, inversely, takes action against something he disagrees with. Guts denounces the very idea of prayer, claiming that the act of clasping hands only prevents people from fighting for their lives. Farnese eventually begins to reject her faith and the rigidity of her beliefs after finding out the truth about Mozgus. After the battle between Guts and Mozgus, Farnese decides to follow Guts, to find a new purpose in her life, away from her social position and the church.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Berserk&quot; has been widely acclaimed by critics. Reviewing the first volume, Michael Aronson of &quot;Manga Life&quot; described &quot;Berserk&quot; as &quot;a curious mix of medieval barbarism, sorcery and futurist technology, combining ghouls, guns and gore. The result is beautifully rendered badass action with enough bloody violence to keep fans of the genre happy.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Berserk&quot; offers a montage of merciless violence and thrilling action sequences in a blend of pure fantasy and graphic horror.&quot; Grant Goodman of &quot;Pop Culture Shock&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Berserk&quot; redefines what is considered a well-written fantasy manga. There are few manga that come anywhere close to creating a complex tale that includes medieval warfare, magic, and horror.&quot; Reviewing the first two volumes, Greg McElhatton of &quot;Read About Comics&quot; wrote, &quot;it&#x27;s still hard to identify what about &quot;Berserk&quot; brings across such a fascination. Is it the characters? The visual look of the monsters? The little hints of a troubled past, like Guts&#x27; tattoo that oozes blood? All of the above? I&#x27;m not sure, but I do know that I&#x27;m hooked.&quot; In his review of the third volume, Daniel Briscoe of &quot;The Fandom Post&quot; called the series &quot;a tragic story of hatred, violence, and innocence lost,&quot; adding that Miura &quot;manages to pack so much emotion, both good and bad, next to so much violence and gore I believe is a testament to his writing and his artwork.&quot;

In his review of the first six volumes, Satyajit Chetri of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;By the end of the fifth volume, &quot;Berserk&quot; has morphed into a touching tale of humanity, friendship and ambition. It is less about the blood spilt and more about the choices made by the characters, the small twists that will ultimately turn friends into nemeses.&quot; Reviewing the twelfth volume, Eduardo M. Chavez writing for &quot;AnimeOnDVD&quot;, commented that despite its long-running publication, &quot;&quot;Berserk&quot; is as shocking and unique as ever this far into the series. There are few titles out there that can sustain the level of intensity and relevance as this.&quot; In his review of the twenty-first volume, Scott Campbell of &quot;Active Anime&quot; wrote, &quot;The deep, dark places that this manga travels to both in story and in artistic expression can be as interesting and captivating as they are horrifying,&quot; adding that there are not many other stories or manga quite like &quot;Berserk&quot;. Writing for &quot;SciFi.com&quot;, Zac Bertschy said, &quot;Kentaro Miura has managed to create a story that&#x27;s not only darkly disturbing, but also absorbing and affecting on a deeper level than most manga titles can achieve.&quot; Bertschy praised the story and character development, concluding, &quot;Not for the faint of heart, &quot;Berserk&quot; is perfect for mature manga fans who like a little blood with their drama.&quot;

In &quot;&quot;, author Jason Thompson gave &quot;Berserk&quot; 4 out of four stars. He called it &quot;[a] blood-soaked sword-and-sorcery epic with elements of Clive Barker&#x27;s &quot;Hellraiser&quot;,&quot; and wrote, &quot;&quot;Berserk&quot;″s medieval European world of mud and blood is so realistic—and drawn in such realistic detail—that when dark fantasy elements begin to intrude upon it, they do so with a slow, dawning horror.&quot; Thompson, in a review for &quot;j-pop.com&quot;, also wrote, &quot;Despite the slaughter, &quot;Berserk&quot; doesn&#x27;t feel as amoral as it could be; our hero is a killer, but given his well-developed back story, his occasional tears of remorse seem more genuine than, say, &quot;Crying Freeman&quot;″s.&quot; In another article, writing for &quot;Anime News Network&quot; (ANN), Thompson said that &quot;Berserk&quot; started as &quot;the story of a lone swordsman traveling the world fighting demons with blood and sweat,&quot; and it was later turned into a &quot;fantasy RPG party of heroes with a magic-user, a thief, a fighter, some elves, etc.,&quot; commenting that Miura apparently was &quot;aiming the series at a younger age group.&quot; Despite this, Thompson stated: &quot;I&#x27;m still impressed by Miura&#x27;s great art and his ability to create such a long storyline with so much scope and (relative to other manga, at least) so little filler. No other seinen fantasy manga has such well-developed characters with such deep backstories, even for the minor characters.&quot;

Matt Fagaly, writing for Crunchyroll, analyzed &quot;Berserk&quot;″s use of and manga tropes in the Lost Children arc (volumes 14–16), which resulted in an &quot;entirely original and moving narrative.&quot; Fagaly commented about the arc protagonist, Jill, and her hopeful words at the end of that story, further adding, &quot;I have never seen another Shonen or Shojo express this notion with the same audacity, depth, and idiosyncrasy as &quot;Berserk&quot;.&quot; Carl Kimlinger, writing for ANN, in his review of the thirty-fifth volume, compared Guts&#x27; &quot;monster-plagued&quot; trip to Elfhelm to the fantasy tales of Robert E. Howard and, in comparing the volume to the previous ones, he wrote that series dropped down a notch, although he stated that it was not a &quot;disastrous drop,&quot; but &quot;just the series falling back into a comfortable, classical adventure mode.&quot; Brittany Vincent of &quot;Otaku USA&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Berserk&quot; is undoubtedly one of the most unique and engaging Western-style fantasies of all time.&quot; Writing for &quot;Syfy Wire&quot;, Eric Frederiksen said, &quot;&quot;Berserk&quot; is one of the longest-running manga, and consistently one of the darkest out there, but also one of the most emotionally powerful and rewarding.&quot; Writing for Crunchyroll, Peter Fobian expressed, &quot;&quot;Berserk&quot; is one of the most deeply personal works I&#x27;ve ever read, both for myself and in my perception of Miura&#x27;s works. The series&#x27; transformation in the past 30 years artistically and thematically is so singular it&#x27;s difficult to find another work that comes close.&quot;

====Artwork====
Miura&#x27;s artwork has been particularly praised by critics. Bertschy said that the artwork is where &quot;Berserk&quot; &quot;really shines,&quot; adding, &quot;The cross-hatching work, the level of detail, it&#x27;s all stunning. Every page is a work of art, each scene drawn with the outmost attention to detail and atmosphere.&quot; He compared the art to the 1950s horror comics from EC Comics and found it fitting to the series&#x27; &quot;gruesome nature.&quot; Bertschy concluded, &quot;Miura is a fabulously talented artist and author, and future manga series by him will be met with great anticipation.&quot; Thompson said, &quot;Miura&#x27;s art is one of the real attractions. The people may occasionally look funky, but castles, knights, horses, and Baroque and Romanesque trappings are drawn with detail and accuracy.&quot; McElhatton wrote that he was &quot;pretty unimpressed&quot; with Miura&#x27;s art at first, but he changed his mind after the demons appeared, stating, &quot;Miura draws demons in such a wrong and disturbing manner that it&#x27;s unsettling. That&#x27;s how demons should look, of course.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;this work has a style characteristic of other 1980s manga, with sparse dialogue, spectacular action sequences and gritty character art. The pencil shading and use of shadows lend an ominous tone.&quot; Campbell wrote, &quot;You just can&#x27;t know what &#x27;attention to detail&#x27; means until you read &quot;Berserk&quot;—it&#x27;s rare when it comes to what it has to offer to all the readers out there, so really it&#x27;s no wonder that it stands out as much as it does.&quot; Campbell also commented, &quot;The closest thing visually that &quot;Berserk&quot; could be compared to might be &quot;Claymore&quot;, another very good manga—but really &quot;Berserk&quot; is on a plain of its own.&quot; Writing for &quot;Advanced Media Network&quot;, Serdar Yegulalp said that the artwork of the first volumes are &quot;a little rougher and less polished than the later ones,&quot; but that after the eighth volume &quot;there is scarcely a page that doesn&#x27;t look spectacular,&quot; adding that &quot;Miura&#x27;s loving attention to detail on most any page or panel is stupefying.&quot; Writing for ANN, Casey Brienza stated, &quot;Miura&#x27;s artwork is exquisite and, remarkably, drawn without the help of an army of assistants. And while he has been great right from the first page of volume one, he has improved over the many years of working on &quot;Berserk&quot;.&quot;

In another review for &quot;Graphic Novel Reporter&quot;, Brieza wrote, &quot;Unlike virtually all other commercially successful manga artists, Miura produces his artwork without assistants, and the exquisite detail of this erotic-grotesque, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-esque high fantasy issues from his hand and his hand alone,&quot; adding that it is &quot;one that appeals to men and women alike.&quot; Carlo Santos, reviewer from ANN, wrote, &quot;Miura&#x27;s complete command of light and shadow gives every moment an otherworldly quality—this is one of the few series that can honestly claim to transport its readers to another time and place—and the attention to backgrounds is a welcome sight when so many other artists are too lazy to be bothered.&quot; Kimlinger wrote that Miura&#x27;s art &quot;is among the most intricate, evocative and plain beautiful art ever to be put to page and arranged cinematically. He draws wonderfully expressive faces, awe-inspiring monsters, gorgeous armor and some of the finest gore to be found just about anywhere.&quot; Chetri described Miura&#x27;s otherworld featured in the first arc as &quot;something a drug-addled MC Escher would have painted,&quot; also noting homages to &quot;Hellraiser&quot; and H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos, and called Miura a &quot;splendid storyteller whose artwork is stark and bold enough to bring the world of Guts to life magnificently.&quot; Writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, Bruna Penilhas commented that Miura&#x27;s level of detail in his illustrations is &quot;impressive from start to finish,&quot; praising the design and features of his characters, adding that he was able to &quot;perfectly illustrate characteristics and feelings such as pain, anger and sadness.&quot; Alex Traub from &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented about the comparison of Miura&#x27;s drawings to Hieronymus Bosch&#x27;s paintings, particularly for Miura&#x27;s images of &quot;little human figures occupying sweeping fantastical landscapes,&quot; adding, &quot;Mr. Miura was known for his spectacular, apocalyptic style; specific images—a humongous sword, a monster cloaked in shadow—are immediately recognizable to his fans.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Berserk&quot; is regarded as one of the most influential dark fantasy works. Peter Fobian, in an essay of the legacy and impact of &quot;Berserk&quot;, called it a &quot;monolith not only for anime and manga, but also fantasy literature, video games, you name it&quot;, comparing its level of influence to &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, further adding, &quot;it&#x27;s difficult to imagine what the world might look like without it, and the generations of creators the series inspired.&quot;

According to writer and editor Kazushi Shimada, series like &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot; or &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen&quot; would not have existed if not for &quot;Berserk&quot;. Some dark fantasy manga authors who have declared influence from &quot;Berserk&quot; include Hajime Isayama (&quot;Attack on Titan&quot;), Kazue Kato (&quot;Blue Exorcist&quot;), and Yana Toboso (&quot;Black Butler&quot;). Other authors influenced by &quot;Berserk&quot; include Makoto Yukimura (&quot;Vinland Saga&quot;), Yūki Tabata (&quot;Black Clover&quot;), and Ryōgo Narita (&quot;Baccano!&quot; and &quot;Durarara!!&quot;). Adi Shankar, producer of the &quot;Castlevania&quot; animated series, said in an interview that he would like to adapt &quot;Berserk&quot;, calling the &quot;hyper-detailed beauty&quot; of Miura&#x27;s artwork a &quot;true masterpiece&quot;, while Adam Deats, &quot;Castlevania&quot; assistant director, stated that the show was inspired by &quot;Berserk&quot;.

Critics like Gene Park of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and Ramsey Isler of &quot;IGN&quot; stated that &quot;Berserk&quot; started a visual trend of characters wielding giant swords that spread to Cloud Strife from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Dante from &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, and Ichigo Kurosaki from &quot;Bleach&quot;.

&quot;Berserk&quot; has also inspired a number of video games, including the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; series, the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series (considerably &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;XIV&quot;), the &quot;Dark Souls&quot; series, &quot;Bloodborne&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Elden Ring&quot;, and Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma&quot; series.

Finnish heavy metal band Battle Beast have written songs about &quot;Berserk&quot;, including several on their 2013 self-titled album. When guitarist Anton Kabanen left Battle Beast in 2015, he formed Beast in Black and continues to write songs about the series. The deathcore band Brand of Sacrifice released the album &quot;God Hand&quot; in 2019. Both the band and album are hugely inspired by &quot;Berserk&quot;. In 2021, deathcore band Slaughter to Prevail released a music video for their song &quot;Zavali Ebalo&quot;, which featured scenes from the &quot;Berserk&quot; 1997 anime series.

<text>Bruno Richard Hauptmann (November 26, 1899 – April 3, 1936) was a German-born carpenter who was convicted of the abduction and murder of Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., the 20-month-old son of aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh. The Lindbergh kidnapping became known as the &quot;crime of the century&quot;. Both Hauptmann and his wife, Anna Hauptmann, proclaimed his innocence to his death, when he was executed in 1936 by electric chair at the Trenton State Prison. Anna later sued the State of New Jersey, various former police officers, the Hearst newspapers that had published pre-trial articles insisting on Hauptmann&#x27;s guilt, and former prosecutor David T. Wilentz.

==Background==
Bruno Richard Hauptmann was born in Kamenz, a town near Dresden in the Kingdom of Saxony, which was a state of the German Empire. He was the youngest of five children. Neither he nor his family or friends used the name Bruno, although prosecutors in the Lindbergh kidnapping trial insisted on referring to him by that name. At the age of eleven, he joined the Boy Scouts (). Hauptmann attended public school during the day while attending trade school () at night, studying carpentry for the first year, then switching to machine building () for the next two years.
Hauptmann&#x27;s father died in 1917. During that same year, Hauptmann learned that his brother, Herman, had been killed fighting in France in World War I. Not long after that, he was informed that another brother, Max, had also been killed while fighting in Russia. Shortly thereafter, Hauptmann was conscripted into the German Army and assigned to an artillery battery.

Upon receiving his orders, he was sent to Bautzen but was transferred to the 103rd Infantry Replacement Regiment upon his arrival. In 1918, Hauptmann was assigned to the 12th Machine Gun Company at Königsbrück. Hauptmann later claimed he was deployed to western France with the 177th Regiment of Machine Gunners in either August or September 1918, then fought in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel; that he was gassed in September or October 1918; and that he was struck in the helmet by shrapnel from shelling, knocking him out so that he was left for dead. When he came to, he crawled back to safety and was back on duty that evening.

After the war, Hauptmann and a friend robbed two women wheeling baby carriages they were using to transport food on the road between Wiesa and Nebelschütz. The friend wielded Hauptmann&#x27;s army pistol during the commission of this crime. Hauptmann&#x27;s other charges include burgling a mayor&#x27;s house with the use of a ladder. Released after three years in prison, he was arrested three months later on suspicion of additional burglaries.

Hauptmann illegally entered the United States by stowing away on an ocean liner. Landing in New York City in November 1923, the 24-year-old Hauptmann was protected by a member of the established German community and worked as a carpenter. He married a German waitress, Anna Schoeffler (1898–1994), in 1925 and became a father eight years later. He was known to be very secretive; his wife did not know his first name was Bruno until his arrest.

==Lindbergh kidnapping==
===Crime and investigation===
On the evening of March 1, 1932, Charles Lindbergh Jr., son of aviator Charles Lindbergh, was kidnapped from Highfields, New Jersey; a homemade ladder was found under the window of the child&#x27;s room. The $50,000 demanded in a ransom note had been delivered by John F. Condon, but the infant&#x27;s body was found on May 12 in woods from the family&#x27;s home. The death was ascribed to a blow to the head, which some have theorized occurred accidentally during the abduction. The ransom bills became increasingly used, and NYPD officer James J. Finn began to map the places where the bills were used. Upon receiving a new report of a location, Finn would quickly interview whoever had been given the bill.

On September 15, 1934, a bank teller realized that the serial number on a $10 gold certificate deposited by a gas station was on the list of Lindbergh ransom bills. On the bill&#x27;s margin, the attendant, who found the certificate suspicious, had written the license plate number of the customer&#x27;s car, which turned out to be Hauptmann&#x27;s. Hauptmann was placed under surveillance by the New York City Police Department, New Jersey State Police, and the FBI. On September 19, Hauptmann realized he was being watched and attempted to escape, speeding and running through red lights. He was arrested by Finn after finding himself blocked by a truck on Park Avenue just north of Tremont Avenue in the Bronx.

===Trial===
His trial was dubbed the &quot;Trial of the Century&quot;, while Hauptmann was named &quot;The Most Hated Man in the World&quot;.

Evidence against Hauptmann included: $14,600 of the ransom money found in his garage; testimony alleging handwriting and spelling similarities to that found on the ransom notes; testimony that lumber used in constructing the ladder probably originated in Hauptmann&#x27;s house; Condon&#x27;s address and telephone number found written on the inside of one of Hauptmann&#x27;s closets; and what appeared to be a hand-drawn sketch of a ladder found in one of Hauptmann&#x27;s notebooks. Experts retained by the defense were never called to testify.

The trial began on January 3, 1935 and lasted until February 13. During the trial, Hauptmann was identified as the man who received the ransom money, the man who had spent some of the ransom gold certificates, and as a man seen near the Lindbergh home on the day of the kidnapping. He had been absent from work on the day of the ransom payment and had quit his job two days later.

Hauptmann&#x27;s attorney, Edward J. Reilly, argued that the evidence against Hauptmann was entirely circumstantial, as no reliable witness had placed Hauptmann at the scene of the crime, nor were his fingerprints found on the ladder, the ransom notes, or anywhere in the nursery.

Hauptmann was convicted, however, and immediately sentenced to death. His appeals failed, though his execution was stayed twice while New Jersey Governor Harold G. Hoffman reviewed the case.

===Execution===
On April 3, 1936, Hauptmann was executed in the electric chair at the New Jersey State Prison. Reporters present said he made no statement. His spiritual advisor said that Hauptmann told him, before being taken from his cell, &quot; (&quot;I am absolutely innocent of the crimes I am accused of&quot;).

Hauptmann&#x27;s widow, Anna, had his body cremated. Two Lutheran pastors conducted a private memorial service in German. A crowd of some 2,000 gathered outside.

==Guilt questioned==
In the latter part of the 20th century, the case against Hauptmann came under serious scrutiny. For instance, one item of evidence at his trial was a scrawled phone number on a board in his closet, which was the number of the man who delivered the ransom, John F. Condon. A juror at the trial said this was the one item that convinced him the most; according to some accounts, a reporter later admitted he had written the number himself. However, Hauptmann stated in court that he had written it but could not remember why.

Additionally, neither Lindbergh nor the go-between who delivered the ransom initially identified Hauptmann as the recipient. Condon, after seeing Hauptmann in a lineup at New York Police Department Greenwich Street Station, told FBI Special Agent Turrou that Hauptmann was not &quot;John&quot;, the man whom Condon claimed he had passed the ransom money to in St. Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery. He further stated that Hauptmann looked different (for instance that he had different eyes, was heavier, and had different hair), and that &quot;John&quot; was actually dead because he had been murdered by his confederates. However, during the trial, &quot;Condon did identify Hauptmann, although he took a pounding from the defense for his earlier failure to do so&quot;, and later claimed that he had &quot;immediately recognized John&quot;. His initial description of &quot;John&quot; as a person &quot;in his thirties, 5&#x27;9&quot; tall, and 165 pounds and [who] spoke with a distinct German accent [...] turned out to be a fair description of Hauptmann.&quot;

While waiting in a car nearby, Lindbergh heard the voice of &quot;John&quot; calling to Condon during the ransom drop-off, but never saw him. Although he testified before the Bronx grand jury that he heard only the words &quot;Hey, Doc!&quot;, and that it would be very difficult to say he could recognize a man by his voice, he identified Hauptmann as having the same voice during his trial in Flemington. The police beat Hauptmann while in custody at the Greenwich Street Station.

Other coverage has said that certain witnesses were intimidated, and some claim that the police planted or doctored evidence, such as the ladder; or that the police doctored Hauptmann&#x27;s time cards and ignored fellow workers who stated that Hauptmann was working the day of the kidnapping. These and other findings prompted J. Edgar Hoover, the first Director of the FBI, to question the manner in which the investigation and the trial were conducted. Hauptmann&#x27;s widow campaigned until the end of her life to have her husband&#x27;s conviction reversed.

Erastus Mead Hudson was a fingerprint expert who knew about the then-rare silver nitrate process of collecting fingerprints from wood and other surfaces on which the previous powder method would not work. He found that Hauptmann&#x27;s fingerprints were not on the wood, even in places that the man who made the ladder must have touched. Upon reporting this to a police officer and stating that they must look further, the officer said, &quot;Good God, don&#x27;t tell us that, Doctor!&quot; The ladder was then washed of all fingerprints, and Colonel Norman Schwarzkopf Sr., the Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, refused to disclose to the public that Hauptmann&#x27;s prints were not on the ladder.

Several books have been written proclaiming Hauptmann&#x27;s innocence. These books variously criticize the police for allowing the crime scenes to become contaminated, Lindbergh and his associates for interfering with the investigation, Hauptmann&#x27;s trial lawyers for ineffectively representing him, and the reliability of the witnesses and physical evidence presented at the trial. Scottish journalist Ludovic Kennedy in particular questioned much of the evidence, such as the origin of the ladder and the testimony of many of the witnesses.

In her book about another high-profile trial of the 1930s, the Winnie Ruth Judd case, investigative reporter Jana Bommersbach argued that Hauptmann could not have received a fair trial because the press created an atmosphere of prejudice against him. Bommersbach noted that in those days, newspapers acted as both &quot;judge and jury&quot;, and covered crime in a way that would be considered sensationalistic today.

In 1974, Anthony Scaduto wrote &quot;Scapegoat&quot;, which took the position that Hauptmann was framed and that the police both withheld and fabricated evidence. This led to further investigation, and in 1985, Ludovic Kennedy published &quot;The Airman and the Carpenter&quot;, in which he argued that Hauptmann had not kidnapped and murdered Lindbergh Jr. The book was made into the 1996 television film &quot;Crime of the Century&quot;, starring Stephen Rea and Isabella Rossellini.

Some authors suggest Lindbergh was involved in the kidnapping and/or death of his baby, including retired judge Lise Pearlman in her 2020 book &quot;The Lindbergh Kidnapping Suspect No. 1: The Man Who Got Away&quot;. She points out that instead of being investigated as a possible suspect (due to his fame), Lindbergh helped lead the investigation despite being home at the time of the abduction. 

Not all modern authors agree with these theories. Jim Fisher, a former FBI agent and professor at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, has written two books on the subject, &quot;The Lindbergh Case&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Ghosts of Hopewell&quot; (1999) to address, at least in part, what he calls a &quot;revision movement&quot;. In these texts, he explains in detail the evidence against Hauptmann. He provides an interpretation discussing both the pros and cons of that evidence. He concluded:

For more than 50 years, Hauptmann&#x27;s widow fought with the New Jersey courts without success to get the case re-opened. In 1982, the then 82-year-old Anna Hauptmann sued the State of New Jersey, various former police officers, the Hearst newspapers that had published pre-trial articles insisting on Hauptmann&#x27;s guilt, and former prosecutor David T. Wilentz (then 86) for over $100 million in wrongful-death damages. She claimed that the newly discovered documents proved misconduct by the prosecution and the manufacture of evidence by government agents, all of whom were biased against Hauptmann because he happened to be of German ethnicity. In 1983, the United States Supreme Court refused her request that the federal judge considering the case should be disqualified because of judicial bias, and in 1984, the judge dismissed her claims.
In 1985, more than 23,000 pages of Hauptmann-case police documents were found in the garage of the late Governor Hoffman. These documents, along with 34,000 pages of FBI files, which, although discovered in 1981, had not been disclosed to the public, represented a windfall of previously undisclosed information. As a direct result of this new evidence, Anna Hauptmann again amended her civil complaint on July 14, 1986, to clear her late husband&#x27;s name by continuing to assert that he was &quot;framed from beginning to end&quot; by the police looking for a suspect. She suggested that the rail of the ladder taken from the attic, where they used to live in 1935, was planted by the police, and that the ransom money was left behind by Isidor Fisch, who was possibly the real kidnapper. Fisch applied for a passport on May 12, 1932, the same day that the Lindbergh baby was found dead. On December 9, 1933, he sailed for Germany, taking with him &quot;$600 to buy Reichsmarks&quot;, although Hauptmann testified during the trial that he had in fact given this exact amount to Fisch. In addition to this, &quot;Fisch&#x27;s German relatives described him as being penniless, and his American associates claimed he left the country owing them sizable debts.&quot; In 1990, New Jersey&#x27;s governor, James Florio, declined her appeal for a meeting to clear Hauptmann&#x27;s name. Anna Hauptmann died on October 10, 1994.

Lindbergh, for his part, believed that Hauptmann must have been involved in the kidnapping and murder of his son.

<text>Guy Jean-Leonard Thys (6 December 1922 – 1 August 2003) was a Belgian football manager, mostly known for being the most successful manager in the history of the Belgium national football team as he managed to lead the national side to their only UEFA European Championship final in 1980 and a fourth–place finish at the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

==Career==

Thys was born in Antwerp and started his career in the 1940s and 50s as a football player with Beerschot, Daring Molenbeek and Standard. In 1952 and 1953 he played two matches with the &quot;Red Devils&quot;, the Belgium national team.

He combined the activities of player and trainer for Cercle Brugge from 1954 until 1958. In 1959 he performed the same functions for Racing Lokeren. He became a full-time trainer with Wezel the same year, followed by Herentals, Beveren, Union Sint-Gillis, and Antwerp. Under Thys&#x27; leadership Antwerp was a finalist in the Belgian Cup and twice finished second in the championship. Thys was appointed Belgium manager in 1976 and remained in the job until 1989, managing the team for 101 games, 45 of which were victories. Eight months after stepping down as manager Thys was re-appointed in early 1990 in order to take charge of the team for the 1990 World Cup. The side duly qualified through the group stage and was knocked out by the England national team in the second round of the tournament. Thys retired again in 1991.

Under his lead the &quot;Red Devils&quot; participated twice in the European Championship, and three times at the World Cup. In 1980, Belgium narrowly lost the European Championship final to Germany in Rome. In the opening game of the 1982 World Cup, Belgium surprised the world by beating the reigning world champions Argentina 1–0. In 1986 Belgium finished fourth in the World Cup in Mexico. His team beat Spain and the Soviet Union, but was defeated by Diego Maradona and his Argentine team in the semi-finals.

==Death==
Guy Thys died on 1 August 2003.

<doc id="286747" wikidata="Q9359" url="?curid=286747" title="Google bombing">
<text>The terms Google bombing and Google washing refer to the practice of causing a website to rank highly in web search engine results for irrelevant, unrelated or off-topic search terms. In contrast, search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of improving the search engine listings of web pages for &quot;relevant&quot; search terms.

Google-bombing is done for either business, political, or comedic purposes (or some combination thereof). Google&#x27;s search-rank algorithm ranks pages higher for a particular search phrase if enough other pages linked to it use similar anchor text. By January 2007, however, Google had tweaked its search algorithm to counter popular Google bombs such as &quot;miserable failure&quot; leading to George W. Bush and Michael Moore; now, search results list pages about the Google bomb itself. On 21 June 2015, the first result in a Google search for &quot;miserable failure&quot; was this article. Used both as a verb and a noun, &quot;Google bombing&quot; was introduced to the &quot;New Oxford American Dictionary&quot; in May 2005.

Google bombing is related to spamdexing, the practice of deliberately modifying HTML to increase the chance of a website being placed close to the beginning of search engine results, or to influence the category to which the page is assigned in a misleading or dishonest manner.

The term &quot;Googlewashing&quot; was coined by Andrew Orlowski in 2003 in order to describe the use of media manipulation to change the perception of a term, or push out competition from search engine results pages (SERPs).

==History==
Google bombs date back as far as 1999, when a search for &quot;more evil than Satan himself&quot; resulted in the Microsoft homepage as the top result.

In September 2000 the first Google bomb with a verifiable creator was created by &quot;Hugedisk Men&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, a now-defunct online humor magazine, when it linked the text &quot;dumb motherfucker&quot; to a site selling George W. Bush-related merchandise. Hugedisk had also unsuccessfully attempted to Google bomb an equally derogatory term to bring up an Al Gore-related site. After a fair amount of publicity the George W. Bush-related merchandise site retained lawyers and sent a cease-and-desist letter to &quot;Hugedisk&quot;, thereby ending the Google bomb.

Adam Mathes is credited with coining the term &quot;Google bombing&quot; when he mentioned it in an April 6, 2001, article in the online magazine &quot;uber.nu&quot;. In the article Mathes details his connection of the search term &quot;talentless hack&quot; to the website of his friend, Andy Pressman, by recruiting fellow webloggers to link to his friend&#x27;s page with the desired term. Some experts forecast that the practice of Google Bombing is over, as changes to Google&#x27;s algorithm over the years have minimised the effect of the technique.

==Uses as tactical media==
The Google Bomb has been used for tactical media as a way of performing a &quot;hit-and-run&quot; media attack on popular topics. Such attacks include Anthony Cox&#x27;s attack in 2003. He created a parody of the &quot;404 – page not found&quot; browser error message in response to the war in Iraq. The page looked like the error page but was titled &quot;These Weapons of Mass Destruction cannot be displayed&quot;. This website could be found as one of the top hits on Google after the start of the war in Iraq. Also, in an attempt to detract attention from the far-right group English Defence League (EDL), a parody group has been made known as &quot;English Disco Lovers&quot;, with the expressed purpose of Google bombing the acronym.

==Alternative meanings==
The Google bomb is often misunderstood by those in the media and publishing industry who do not retain technical knowledge of Google&#x27;s ranking factors. For example, talk radio host Alex Jones has often conducted what he calls &quot;Google bombs&quot; by dispatching instructions to his radio/Internet listeners. In this context, the term is used to describe a rapid and massive influx of keyword searches for a particular phrase. The keyword surge gives the impression that the related content has suddenly become popular. The strategy behind this type of Google bombing is to attract attention from the larger mainstream media and influence them to publish content related to the keyword.

==Google bowling==
By studying what types of ranking manipulations a search engine is using, a company can provoke a search engine into &quot;lowering&quot; the ranking of a competitor&#x27;s website. This practice, known as Google bowling or negative SEO, is often done by purchasing Google bombing services (or other SEO techniques) not for one&#x27;s own website, but rather for that of a competitor. The attacker provokes the search company into punishing the &quot;offending&quot; competitor by displaying their page further down in the search results. For victims of Google bowling, it may be difficult to appeal the ranking decrease because Google avoids explaining penalties, preferring not to &quot;educate&quot; real offenders. If the situation is clear-cut, however, Google could lift the penalty after submitting a request for reconsideration. Furthermore, after the Google Penguin update, Google search rankings now take Google bowling into account and very rarely will a website be penalized due to low-quality &quot;farm&quot; backlinks.

==Other search engines==
Other search engines use similar techniques to rank results and are also affected by Google bombs. A search for &quot;miserable failure&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; on September 29, 2006, brought up the official George W. Bush biography number one on Google, Yahoo!, and MSN and number two on Ask.com. On June 2, 2005, Tooter reported that George Bush was ranked first for the keyword &quot;miserable&quot;, &quot;failure&quot;, and &quot;miserable failure&quot; in both Google and Yahoo!; Google has since addressed this and disarmed the George Bush Google bomb and many others.

The BBC, reporting on Google bombs in 2002, used the headline &quot;Google Hit By Link Bombers&quot;, acknowledging to some degree the idea of &quot;link bombing&quot;. In 2004, Search Engine Watch suggested that the term be &quot;link bombing&quot; because of its application beyond Google, and continues to use that term as it is considered more accurate.

By January 2007, Google changed its indexing structure so that Google bombs such as &quot;miserable failure&quot; would &quot;typically return commentary, discussions, and articles&quot; about the tactic itself. Google announced the changes on its official blog. In response to criticism for allowing the Google bombs, Matt Cutts, head of Google&#x27;s Webspam team, said that Google bombs had not &quot;been a very high priority for us&quot;.

==Motivations==

===Competitions===
In May 2004, the websites Dark Blue and SearchGuild teamed up to create what they termed the &quot;SEO Challenge&quot; to Google bomb the phrase &quot;nigritude ultramarine&quot;.

The contest sparked controversy around the Internet, as some groups worried that search engine optimization (SEO) companies would abuse the techniques used in the competition to alter queries more relevant to the average user. This fear was offset by the belief that Google would alter their algorithm based on the methods used by the Google bombers.

In September 2004, another SEO contest was created. This time, the objective was to get the top result for the phrase &quot;seraphim proudleduck&quot;. A large sum of money was offered to the winner, but the competition turned out to be a hoax.

In March 2005&#x27;s issue of &quot;.net&quot; magazine, a contest was created among five professional web developers to make their site the number-one site for the made-up phrase &quot;crystalline incandescence&quot;.

===Political activism===

Some of the most famous Google bombs are also expressions of political opinions (e.g. &quot;liar&quot; leading to Tony Blair or &quot;miserable failure&quot; leading to the White House&#x27;s biography of George W. Bush):

* In 2003, Steven Lerner, creator of Albino Blacksheep, created a parody webpage titled &quot;French Military Victories&quot;. When typed into Google, the first result (or the &quot;I&#x27;m Feeling Lucky&quot; result) led to a webpage resembling a Google error message, reading, &quot;Your search – French military victories – did not match any documents. Did you mean French military &quot;defeats&quot;?&quot; The page received over 50,000 hits within 18 hours of its release. Links near the top of the page led to a simplified list of French military history. The only war listed as a win for the French was the French Revolution, in which they fought themselves. As of May 2, 2011, the page is no longer listed in Google&#x27;s first few results for &quot;French military victories&quot;, but several links on the list go to sites recounting the joke.
* In 2003, columnist Dan Savage began his campaign to define the word &quot;santorum&quot; after former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum made several controversial statements regarding homosexuality. A search for &quot;santorum&quot; led to the top result being a website defining it as being related to anal sex. One search engine expert has argued that this campaign does not qualify as a Google bomb, arguing that it is instead a successful new definition for a word explained by a website. (see search engine optimization)
* In 2004, Jewish writer and activist Daniel Sieradski urged visitors to his blog to link to the Wikipedia article for &quot;Jew&quot; in response to findings, first publicized by Steven Weinstock, that a search for &quot;Jew&quot; returned the anti-Semitic website Jew Watch at the top of the results. The campaign was successful in displacing the site from the top result.
* In the same year the Persian Gulf naming dispute was the subject of a Google bomb by an Iranian blogger named Pendar Yousefi.
* In France, groups opposing the DADVSI copyright bill, proposed by minister Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, mounted a Google bombing campaign linking &quot;ministre blanchisseur&quot; (&quot;laundering minister&quot;) to an article on Donnedieu de Vabres&#x27; conviction for money laundering. The campaign was so efficient that , merely searching for &quot;ministre&quot; (&quot;minister&quot;) or &quot;blanchisseur&quot; (&quot;launderer&quot;) brings up a news report of his conviction as one of the first results.
* In December 2004, the &quot;Yan Ang Pinay&quot; (&quot;I am a Filipina&quot;) campaign encouraged bloggers to self-identify as Filipina and link the word Filipina to target URLs such as the Filipina Women&#x27;s Network (ffwn.org), to displace mail-order bride sites in search results.
* In November 2005, after the controversy that erupted in the Philippines over the allegations that former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo had cheated in the 2004 elections, the phrase &quot;pekeng pangulo&quot; (Tagalog for &quot;fake president&quot;) was linked to her official website (kgma.org).
* In 2005 an Estonian blogger led a successful campaign to link the word &quot;masendav&quot; (Estonian for &quot;dismal&quot; or &quot;depressive&quot;) to the homepage of Estonian Centre Party. The Centre Party&#x27;s website still ranks first in the results for &quot;masendav&quot; .
* In the 2006 U.S. midterm elections, many left-wing bloggers, led by MyDD.com, banded together to propel neutral or negative articles about many Republican House candidates to the top of Google searches for their names.
* Also in 2006, &quot;Siedziba szatana&quot; (&quot;satan&#x27;s headquarters&quot;) was linked to the website of controversial Polish ultra-conservative Catholic broadcaster Radio Maryja.
* In or before 2007, Finnish Minister of Culture Tanja Karpela was subject to a Google bombing in which the search &quot;turha lehmä&quot; (&quot;useless bitch&quot;, lit. &quot;useless cow&quot;) returned her web home page. Non-fiction author suggested that the Google bomb might have been done in response to Karpela&#x27;s participation in revising Finnish copyright law. The web site for the Parliament of Finland was also Google-bombed with the search term &quot;mordorin linna&quot; (&quot;Castle of Mordor&quot;).
* In March 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Nikolas Schiller was able to Google bomb &quot;Redacted Name&quot; to highlight his website&#x27;s block on search engines.
* During the initial stages of the anti-Scientology campaign, Project Chanology, hackers and other members of an anonymous Internet group Google-bombed the Church of Scientology&#x27;s main website as the first match found when the term &quot;Dangerous Cult&quot; was searched.
* In September 2008, John Key, leader of the New Zealand National Party was Google-bombed with the query &quot;clueless&quot;.
* In January 2009, a successful Google bomb was performed against the site of the Bulgarian government by a loose group of bloggers and forum users. It was discovered that by mistake, the robots.txt on the government.bg forbade the crawling of the site by indexing machines which allowed for Google bombing. The group linked the search term &quot;failure&quot; () to the government site. Within a couple of days, the first search result for &quot;провал&quot; was the Bulgarian government&#x27;s site regardless of the search results language.
* In April 2009, the website Smart Bitches, Trashy Books launched a Google bomb against Amazon in response to its removal of LGBT material from their ranking lists, Amazon citing it as &quot;adult material&quot;. Within hours of its creation the page appeared on the first page of returned search results for the term &quot;Amazon Rank&quot;.
* In July 2009, Opie and Anthony successfully performed a new method of Google bombing in which a specific word or phrase is artificially raised in Google Trends. The phrase &quot;Rev Al is a racist&quot; was made #1 on Google Trends on July 8, 2009, due to the controversial comments made by Reverend Al Sharpton during Michael Jackson&#x27;s Memorial Service. &quot;Corey Feldman is Hurting&quot; was also number 14 on the top Google Trends for the same day in response to Feldman dressing up as Michael Jackson during the memorial service.
* In September 2010, 4chan users tried to Google bomb the phrase &quot;Robert Pisano MPAA CEO arrested for child molestation!&quot;, as a related action to DDoS attacks on the RIAA, MPAA and British Phonographic Industry (BPI) websites. This was in retaliation for DDoS attacks carried out on The Pirate Bay and various other file-sharing sites.
* In February 2011, several anti-abortion activists managed to make it so that the page for abortion on English Wikipedia was the second highest ranking result for the term &quot;murder&quot;.
* During the summer of 2011, a joke in response to Craig James’ role in the firing of Mike Leach was posted on EveryDayShouldBeSaturday.com. The joke was indexed often enough by a major search engine that typing &quot;Craig James&quot; into the search box at the search engine resulted in the autocomplete function including &quot;killed 5 hookers&quot;. Later this humorous search index behavior was characterized as a &quot;Google bomb&quot; in regards to Craig James’ campaign for elected office.
* In July 2012, searching for &quot;plagiator&quot; (Romanian for &quot;plagiarist/cheater&quot;) returns the personal page of Romanian prime minister Victor Ponta, who is accused of plagiarizing his PhD thesis, and various news websites which provide information about the scandal that erupted around the politician. This Google bomb has become itself a piece of news in the Romanian media.
* In October 2012, searching the phrase &quot;completely wrong&quot; on Google images, returns pictures of Mitt Romney, the Republican Nominee for the U.S. Presidential Election in 2012. However, this was not actually an example of a Google bomb - the result came naturally from a series of comments made by Romney, rather than a concentrated campaign intended to link the two.
* In September 2012 the English Disco Lovers campaign was initiated with the intention of replacing the English Defence League (EDL) as the number one result for EDL on Google. On 27 August 2013 the English Disco Lovers overtook all English Defence League related items and became the top search result for the acronym &quot;EDL&quot;.
* In June 2015 the search query &quot;top 10 criminals&quot; returned the images of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alongside the images of terrorists, murderers and dictators. However, in an official statement Google apologized and said that it was due to an erroneous meta data published by a British daily.
* In July 2018, the search query &quot;idiot&quot; returned images of President Donald Trump.
* In two separate instances – November 2018 and August 2019 – searching for the word &quot;bhikhari&quot; (Hindi and Urdu for &quot;beggar&quot;) turned up images of Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, alluding to the country&#x27;s financial crisis. In response to the first instance, the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab passed a resolution to demand answer from Google on the issue. In February 2019, following the Pulwama attack, a Google search for &quot;best toilet paper in the world&quot; yielded images of the Flag of Pakistan.

===Commercial use===

Some website operators have adapted Google bombing techniques to do &quot;spamdexing&quot;. This includes, among other techniques, posting of links to a site in an Internet forum along with phrases the promoter hopes to associate with the site (see spam in blogs). Unlike conventional message board spam, the object is not to attract readers to the site directly, but to increase the site&#x27;s ranking under those search terms. Promoters using this technique frequently target forums with low reader traffic, in hopes that it will fly under the moderators&#x27; radar. Wikis in particular are often the target of this kind of page rank vandalism, as all of the pages are freely editable. This practice was also called &quot;money bombing&quot; by John Hiler circa 2004.

Another technique is for the owner of an Internet domain name to set up the domain&#x27;s DNS entry so that all subdomains are directed to the same server. The operator then sets up the server so that page requests generate a page full of desired Google search terms, each linking to a subdomain of the same site, with the same title as the subdomain in the requested URL. Frequently the subdomain matches the linked phrase, with spaces replaced by underscores or hyphens. Since Google treats subdomains as distinct sites, the effect of many subdomains linking to each other is a boost to the PageRank of those subdomains and of any other site they link to.

On February 2, 2007, many users noticed changes in the Google algorithm. These changes largely affected (among other things) Google bombs: as of February 15, 2007, only roughly 10% of the Google bombs still worked. This change was largely due to Google refactoring its valuation of PageRank.

====Quixtar&#x27;s bomb====
Quixtar, a multi-level marketing company now known as Amway North America, has been accused by its critics of using its large network of websites to move sites critical of Quixtar lower in search engine rankings. A Quixtar/Amway independent business owner (IBO) reports that a Quixtar leader advocated the practice in a meeting of Quixtar IBOs. Quixtar/Amway denied wrongdoing and states that its practices are in accordance with search engine rules.

====GoDaddy bomb====

On December 26, 2011, a bomb was started against GoDaddy to remove them from the #1 place on Google for &quot;domain registration&quot; in retaliation for its support for SOPA. This was then disseminated through Hacker News.

====Other examples of Google bombs====
In Australia, one of the first examples of Google bombs was when the keyword &quot;old rice and monkey nuts&quot; was used to generate traffic for &quot;Herald Sun&quot; columnist Andrew Bolt&#x27;s website. The keyword phrase references the alleged $4 billion in loan deals brokered by Tirath Khemlani to Australia in 1974.

In May 2019, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss were targets of multiple Google bombs caused by Reddit users&#x27; dissatisfaction with the eighth season of their show &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Targeted phrases included &quot;bad writers&quot; and &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;.

In Indonesia, President Joko Widodo was target of Googlebombing on Google Picture Search when typing &quot;Monyet Pakai Jas Hujan&quot; (Monkey Wearing Raincoat) the results were President Joko Widodo wearing green raincoat when on an official visit.

<doc id="286774" wikidata="Q55815" url="?curid=286774" title="Elite (video game)">
<text>Elite is a space trading video game. It was written and developed by David Braben and Ian Bell and was originally published by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers in September 1984. &quot;Elite&quot;&#x27;s open-ended game model, and revolutionary 3D graphics led to it being ported to virtually every contemporary home computer system and earned it a place as a classic and a genre maker in gaming history. The game&#x27;s title derives from one of the player&#x27;s goals of raising their combat rating to the exalted heights of &quot;Elite&quot;.

&quot;Elite&quot; was one of the first home computer games to use wire-frame 3D graphics with hidden-line removal. It added graphics and twitch gameplay aspects to the genre established by the 1974 game &quot;Star Trader&quot;. Another novelty was the inclusion of &quot;The Dark Wheel&quot;, a novella by Robert Holdstock which gave players insight into the moral and legal codes to which they might aspire.

The &quot;Elite&quot; series is among the longest-running video game franchises. The first game was followed by the sequels &quot;&quot; in 1993, and &quot;&quot; in 1995, which introduced Newtonian physics, realistic star systems, and seamless freeform planetary landings. A third sequel, &quot;Elite Dangerous&quot;, began crowdfunding in 2012 and was launched on 16 December 2014, following a period of semi-open testing; it received a paid-for expansion season, &quot;Horizons&quot;, on 15 December 2015.

&quot;Elite&quot; proved hugely influential, serving as a model for other games including &quot;Wing Commander: Privateer&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, &quot;EVE Online&quot;, &quot;Freelancer&quot;, the &quot;X&quot; series and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Sky&quot;.

Non-Acorn versions were each first published by Firebird and Imagineer. Subsequently, Frontier Developments has claimed the game to be a &quot;Game by Frontier&quot; to be part of its own back catalogue and all the rights to the game have been owned by David Braben.

== Gameplay ==
The player initially controls the character &quot;Commander Jameson&quot;, though the name can be changed each time the game is saved. The player starts at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship, a Cobra Mark III. Most of the ships that the player encounters are similarly named after snakes or other reptiles. Credits can be accumulated through a number of means. These include piracy, trade, military missions, bounty hunting and asteroid mining. The money generated by these enterprises allows the player to upgrade their ship with enhancements such as better weapons, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, an extra energy bank and more.

In the game universe, stars have single planets, each with a space station in its orbit. Stars are always separated by interstellar distances which cannot be crossed using the ship&#x27;s sublight engines. Travel between stars is accomplished by hyperspace jumps, and is constrained to those within range of the limited fuel capacity (a maximum of 7 light years) of the ship&#x27;s hyperdrive. Sublight travel uses no fuel.

Fuel can be replenished after docking with a space station, which requires matching the ship&#x27;s rotation to that of the station before entering the docking bay—a task that can be avoided by purchasing a docking computer. Equipment upgrades include a fuel scoop, which allows &quot;sun skimming&quot;—collecting energy from the stars&#x27; corona—described by the manual as &quot;a dangerous and difficult activity&quot;, but in practice a fairly simple process far easier than manually docking at a space station—and collecting free-floating cargo canisters and escape capsules liberated after the destruction of other ships.

While making a hyperspace jump between star systems, the antagonistic Thargoid race may intercept the player half way, forcing the player&#x27;s ship to remain in &quot;witch-space&quot; and do battle with the smaller invasion ships of the Thargoid. As the interrupted jump uses the full journey&#x27;s fuel, the player may have insufficient fuel to subsequently jump to a nearby planet, trapping them in witch-space. They must either use an escape capsule, if owned, or abort the game and reload.

An extremely expensive one-time galactic hyperspace upgrade permits travel between the eight galaxies of the game universe. There is little practical difference between the different galaxies. However, in some versions it is necessary to travel to at least the second galaxy to access the game&#x27;s missions. The planetary layout of the galaxies is different, and many players have discovered trade routes between closely positioned planets with fortuitous economic combinations.

Most versions of Elite included several optional jobs for the Galactic Navy. One requires tracking down and destroying a stolen experimental ship; another involves transporting classified information on the Thargoids&#x27; home planet, with Thargoid invasion ships doing their best to see that the player does not succeed throughout the duration of the mission involving multiple interplanetary jumps. Rewards differed depending on the mission - from cash and gems to esoteric hardware such as a cloaking device.

== Development ==
According to Braben and Bell, &quot;Elite&quot; was inspired by a range of sources. The developers refer to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; as influences. Braben also cites the works of Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert L. Forward, Isaac Asimov and Orson Scott Card. While Bell has confirmed that some of the game&#x27;s content was derived from the &quot;Traveller&quot; tabletop role-playing game, including the default commander name Jameson, Braben has denied this several times.

When the developers met at Jesus College, Cambridge, Bell was already working on a game for Acornsoft called &quot;Freefall&quot;. Braben had started writing a game called &quot;Fighter&quot;, but had not yet completed it. The two projects were sufficiently similar that Braben and Bell compared notes, and after seeing &quot;Star Raiders&quot; on the Atari 800 they decided to collaborate to produce what eventually became &quot;Elite&quot;. They first approached Thorn EMI; the company&#x27;s rejection letter stated that the game was too complicated and needed to be finishable in 10 minutes with three lives. Braben and Bell then met with Acornsoft; their demo of &quot;Elite&quot;&#x27;s combat and docking sequences impressed managing director David Johnson-Davies and other Acornsoft executives. The company agreed to publish the finished game, although they feared that it was too ambitious for Braben and Bell, and was uncertain about the merits of two developers instead of one on a single game. The programmers were given a £1,000 advance from the company and a royalty rate of 7.5% was agreed.

The game took two years to write and started out as a 3D arcade game without the trading element. It was written in machine code using assembly language, giving much care to maximum compactness of the code. The last part added was the 3D radar display fitted into the last few unused bytes in their computer.

The original BBC version used a novel split screen approach to show four colours (five, including the black background) onscreen simultaneously; the upper two thirds of the screen were displayed in Mode 4 while the lower part was in Mode 5. The subsequent Electron version ran entirely in Mode 4, because the video chips were not 100% compatible and therefore were in black and white only.

The &quot;Elite&quot; universe contains eight galaxies, each with 256 planets to explore. Due to the limited capabilities of 8-bit computers, these worlds are procedurally generated. A single seed number is run through a fixed algorithm the appropriate number of times and creates a sequence of numbers determining each planet&#x27;s complete composition (position in the galaxy, prices of commodities, and name and local details; text strings are chosen numerically from a lookup table and assembled to produce unique descriptions, such as a planet with &quot;carnivorous arts graduates&quot;). This means that no extra memory is needed to store the characteristics of each planet, yet each is unique and has fixed properties. Each galaxy is also procedurally generated from the first. Braben and Bell at first intended to have 248 galaxies, but Acornsoft insisted on a smaller universe to hide the galaxies&#x27; mathematical origins.

However, the use of procedural generation created a few problems. There are a number of poorly located systems that can be reached only by galactic hyperspace— these are more than 7 light years from their nearest neighbour, and, being low-tech, are unable to replace the galactic hyperdrive, thus trapping the traveller. Braben and Bell also checked that none of the system names were profane - removing an entire galaxy after finding a planet named &quot;Arse&quot;.

The developers did not spend much time playing their creation, and the quality testing was mostly performed by Acornsoft&#x27;s managing director David Johnson-Davies, who also planned the packaging and marketing campaign at the time.

The original BBC Micro disk version uses a non-standard disk-format for copy protection. This relied on specific OSWORD &amp;7F DFS opcodes in the Intel 8271 floppy-disk controller to directly access the disk, and produce a non-standard sector/track-layout. This causes issues for legitimate customers that use the Western Digital 1770 disk-controller (DFS) ROMs from third-party manufacturers such as Watford Electronics. Acorn subsequently released alternative versions of the BBC disks that are compatible with the WD1770. In addition to this, self-modifying code was used as part of the protection system, created by Rob Northen. This BBC disk-copy-protection was also used by Superior Software in its &quot;Exile&quot; game.

== Marketing and release ==
Acornsoft set in motion a large-scale publicity campaign and commissioned a presentational package for the game that was far more elaborate than normal. Acornsoft packaged &quot;Elite&quot; in a box larger than its usual releases, complete with a novella by Robert Holdstock called &quot;The Dark Wheel&quot;, a 64-page Space Trader&#x27;s Flight Training Manual, reference card and a ship identification poster. The flight training manual was written in a style that took the rookie trader through the controls and various aspects of play.

The original Acornsoft version of &quot;The Dark Wheel&quot; promised on its back cover that &quot;[a] sequel to the novella is planned for publication in 1985&quot;, but no direct sequel was ever written. A second novella, &quot;Imprint&quot; by Andy Redman, was included with the IBM PC release of &quot;Elite Plus&quot;, but apart from being set in the same universe it is in no way connected to the original story.

Marketing activities included a £50,000 promotional budget from Acornsoft, including television advertising and a launch party at the Thorpe Park theme park (holding such an event for a video game was almost unheard of at the time) and a competition to be among the first to achieve the status of &quot;Elite&quot;.

=== &quot;The Dark Wheel&quot; ===
The story tells of a young starship pilot named Alex Ryder, whose father Jason is killed when their merchant ship is attacked by a notorious pirate. In trying to understand and avenge his father&#x27;s death and achieve an &quot;iron ass&quot; (a space-trader&#x27;s term for a well-armed- and armoured spaceship), Alex encounters the basics of the Elite universe—including combat, hyperdrive and hyperspace and the deadly aliens called Thargoids. Finally Alex discovers the truth about his father and his combat rank. He also acts as an acceptable face of trading as his female co-pilot, Elyssia Fields, is an alien and wanted in several systems. Alex wants to avenge his father&#x27;s death, but must exercise caution in tracking down the assassin. By trading commodities, he slowly improves the arms and armour of his ship. When he is competent at using the spaceship for combat, but before he feels ready, he makes a trade that is sure to bring his father&#x27;s killer to him.

Alex also learns what the &quot;Dark Wheel&quot; is and what it takes to join its ranks.
== Versions ==
The first version of the game was released for the BBC Micro, model B on tape and disk and &quot;about a month or two later&quot; the Acorn Electron tape version was released. The Electron&#x27;s limitations meant the game was in black and white only, and several game features were cut including Thargoids and suns. Neither the BBC nor the Electron tape versions featured missions. Additionally, the original tape version for the Electron contained a bug that stopped Galactic Hyperspace from working. Acorn provided a mail-in tape-replacement service to upgrade to v1.1 (marked as such on the tape label) that fixed this bug.

A version for the BBC Micro with the 6502 Second Processor was announced by Acornsoft on 25 July 1985, this new version added several extras over the standard BBC version, including 18 ships in the player environment (up from 10), no loading from disc when leaving/arriving at a space station, the ability to save screenshots and print screens to an Epson compatible printer. It also boasted over double the frame rate and a MODE1/MODE2 split screen vs. MODE4/MODE5 giving a full colour game for the first time. https://elite.bbcelite.com/6502sp/ 

The great commercial success of the BBC Micro version prompted a bidding war for the rights to publish &quot;Elite&quot; in other formats, which British Telecom&#x27;s software arm, Telecomsoft, eventually won.

Contemporary versions for home computers based on the 6502 microprocessor were ported by either Bell or Bell and Braben. The Commodore 64 conversion introduced Trumbles (creatures based on the tribbles in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;). When the docking computer is activated in the Commodore 64 version and some other versions, a musical rendition of &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; Waltz is played, as a nod to a space docking sequence in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.
The ZX Spectrum version, programmed by &quot;Torus&quot; included a supernova mission not found in the original.

The Amstrad CPC conversion has fewer ships than other platforms, lacking the Anaconda and Transport, along with some minor differences in missions and titles. Ricardo Pinto, the programmer for the Amstrad version, explained that his team was given a 6502 hex dump by Braben and Bell, which did not help development: &quot;In the end we wrote our version by playing &quot;Elite&quot; on a [BBC Micro] and making ours look the same.&quot; This version included the &quot;supernova rescue&quot; and &quot;cloaking device&quot; missions, and refinements to the launch tube and jump drive animations.

According to the lead programmer of the 16 bit Amiga/Atari ST and the MSX conversions Rob Nicholson, he did not have access to the source code because of contractual issues and had to write them &quot;blind&quot;. All he had were the ship shapes and the procedural generation code for the galaxies.

&quot;Elite Plus&quot; was released for DOS in 1991. Whereas the original &quot;Elite&quot; (1987) for the PC used CGA graphics, &quot;Elite Plus&quot; was upgraded to take advantage of EGA, VGA and MCGA. It was coded entirely in assembly language by Chris Sawyer, who later wrote &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot;.

The Acorn Archimedes version, &quot;ArcElite&quot; (1991), written by Warren Burch &amp; Clive Gringras and regarded by &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine as the best conversion of the original game, added intelligent opponents who engage in their own private battles and police who take an active interest in protecting the law. As well as such gameplay enhancements, the version also exploited the more modern hardware by using polygon mesh graphics in place of the wire-frames. The game world no longer seems to be centred around the player; freighter fleets with escorts go about their own business, pirate formations patrol lawless systems looking for cargo to loot and mining ships can often be found breaking up asteroids for their mineral content. Unlike the mythical Generation Ships of the original, rare occurrences of other non-pirate entities mentioned in the manual really can be found in the Archimedes version: geometric formations of space beacons; hermits living among the asteroids; abandoned ships towed by police (although Dredgers and Generation Ships are confirmed &quot;not&quot; to exist in Archimedes &quot;Elite&quot;). The Archimedes version of &quot;Elite&quot; was originally written to be a space trading game called &quot;Trojan&quot; - however the obvious similarities eventually meant that to avoid a potential lawsuit &quot;Trojan&quot; had to become an official &quot;Elite&quot; conversion. ArcElite was one of a number of games released for free by &quot;The Icon Bar&quot; website in 2006.

Some versions feature a new title, &quot;Archangel&quot;, for the player to earn that substitutes the rank of Commander. Archangel is reached by undertaking a special mission to destroy a space station in a system invaded by the Thargoids. The player&#x27;s reward for completing the mission is to receive the title Archangel and obtain a device that is capable of emulating anti-ECM broadcast.

Versions for 32X and Sega Mega Drive were in development but cancelled due to Sony backing out of the project and lack of publisher. However, a ROM image of the Mega Drive demo was released online by co-designer Ian Bell.

== Reception ==

&quot;Elite&quot; received very positive reviews on its launch and the BBC Micro version eventually sold 107,898 copies. The game&#x27;s popularity became a national phenomenon in the UK, with reports airing on Channel 4 and elsewhere. &quot;Elite&quot; was Firebird&#x27;s best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987. Bell estimates that approximately 600,000 copies were eventually sold for all platforms combined, while Frontier Developments&#x27; Elite page states that the numbers are around a million units.

&quot;Elite&quot;″s technical breakthroughs reportedly amazed the BBC Micro&#x27;s developers, with Sophie Wilson calling it &quot;the game that couldn&#x27;t have been written&quot;. However, many players found gameplay difficult and unfamiliar; the game was so controversial that &quot;The Micro User&quot; devoted its April 1985 letter column to readers debating it.

In his review of the game for &quot;Beebug Magazine&quot; in 1984, David Fell called &quot;Elite&quot; &quot;the best game ever&quot; for the BBC Micro. In &quot;Personal Computer Games&quot; Shingo Sugiura said &quot;&quot;Elite&quot; is vast, complex and very, very absorbing. I&#x27;ve got bulging, red eyeballs from staying up into the early hours but I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m going to continue playing until I am ranked Elite ... or at least Competent ... or even Average ... Buy it!&quot;. John Cook wrote in the December 1984 issue of &quot;Micro Adventurer&quot; &quot;A masterpiece such as this is difficult to describe within existing parameters&quot; and &quot;By any standards, &quot;Elite&quot; is an excellent game, certainly in the Top Three this year. By BBC standards, it is simply the best game that has ever been written for the machine&quot;. &quot;Crash&quot; magazine said about the Spectrum version &quot;&quot;Elite&quot; is one of the most imaginative ever to be designed to run on a home computer&quot; and gave it a score of 92%, while at the same time it was a best-seller in the Gallup charts. The game was number 16 in the &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; &quot;Top 100 Speccy Games&quot; in 1992, was voted number 7 in the &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; &quot;Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; in 1993 and was voted the 9th best game of all time by the readers of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; Magazine for an article that was scheduled to be in a special &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; tribute issue. Similarly &quot;Zzap!64&quot; gave the Commodore 64 version 97%, stating that it was &quot;a brilliant game of blasting and trading and is certainly the best game I&#x27;ve seen this year&quot; in 1985 and the Amiga version 98% in 1989.

In 1984, &quot;Elite&quot; received the Golden Joystick Award for &quot;Best Original Game&quot;. In 1985 the game was awarded the &quot;Best Game Overall&quot; for that year by readers of &quot;Crash&quot; magazine, and &quot;Game of the Year&quot; by &quot;Computer Gamer&quot;. In a 1992 survey of science fiction games, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave the title two of five stars, stating that its &quot;popularity was largely a result of being one of the first space games with a &#x27;large&#x27; universe to explore&quot;. The magazine gave &quot;Elite Plus&quot; two-plus stars, describing it as &quot;More detailed and complex, it is also more tedious than the original&quot;. A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave &quot;Elite&quot; and &quot;Elite Plus&quot; three stars and two-plus stars, respectively.

In 1993, &quot;Commodore Force&quot; ranked the game at number four on its list of the top 100 Commodore 64 games. It was ranked #14 top game of all time by &quot;Next Generation&quot; in 1996, #12 on IGN&#x27;s 2000 &quot;Top 25 PC Games of All Time&quot; list, the #3 most influential video game ever by the &quot;Times&quot; Online in 2007, #6 &quot;Greatest Game&quot; by &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine in 2008, #1 &quot;Top Retro Game&quot; by &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; in 2004, and #1 &quot;best game of the 1980s&quot; by &quot;Next Generation&quot; in 2008. In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked Elite 11th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot; The game was retrospectively awarded 10/10 by the multi-format magazine &quot;Edge&quot;—together with only 2 other games— and is being exhibited at such places as the London Science Museum in the &quot;Game On&quot; exhibition organised and toured by the Barbican Art Gallery. &quot;Elite&quot; is also featured in &quot;Game On! From Pong to Oblivion: The 50 Greatest Video Games of All Time&quot; by authors Simon Byron, Ste Curran and David McCarthy.

In 1991, &quot;PC Format&quot; placed &quot;Elite Plus&quot; on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time. The editors called it &quot;a classic game that mixes solid 3D space combat with trading to create a universe in which you can spend many a happy half-hour bushwhacking the dastardly Thargoids.&quot;

== Impact ==
&quot;Elite&quot; has often been regarded as defining the genre for space trading games. Since its release &quot;Elite&quot; has been credited as being the title that defined the modern space flight simulation genre, a significant source of inspiration for later games in the genre as well as being influential upon gaming as a whole. In interviews, senior producers of CCP Games have cited &quot;Elite&quot; as one of the inspirations for their acclaimed MMORPG, &quot;EVE Online&quot;. The developers of &quot;Jumpgate Evolution&quot;, &quot;Battlecruiser 3000AD&quot;, &quot;Infinity: The Quest for Earth&quot;,
&quot;Space Rangers&quot;, &quot;Hard Truck: Apocalyptic Wars&quot; and &quot;Flatspace&quot; have likewise all credited &quot;Elite&quot; as a source of inspiration. Similar praise has been bestowed elsewhere in the media over the years.

It has been named as one of the most influential games in history, and has been credited as being the first truly open-ended open world game and opening the door for future online persistent worlds such as &quot;Second Life&quot;, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and &quot;EVE Online&quot;. &quot;Elite&quot; is one of the most popularly requested games to be remade, with some arguing that it is still the best example of the genre to date, with more recent titles—including its immediate sequel—not rising up to the same level.

== Legacy ==

In November 1999, on the game&#x27;s 15th birthday, Ian Bell released many binaries and source code of several versions of the original game on his website. A dispute arose between Bell and David Braben regarding Bell&#x27;s decision to make available all versions of the original &quot;Elite&quot;. The dispute has since ended and the various versions became available again on Bell&#x27;s site.

In the late 1980s a variant of the commercial BBC Micro &quot;Elite&quot; release was created by Angus Duggan by disassembling and modifying the 6502 code from the existing with many extra features, originally titled &quot;Elite III&quot; but now known as &quot;Elite A&quot; to minimise confusion. It includes many more ship types, more ship types flyable by the player (who begins in the less capable Adder), cargo delivery missions, some extra equipment items and numerous gameplay improvements. &quot;Elite A&quot; was released publicly in 1997. Like the original game, it can be downloaded free from Ian Bell&#x27;s web site and played under emulation.

Many attempts to develop clones of &quot;Elite&quot; have been made, but most have been abandoned before completion or have otherwise failed to come to fruition. The open source &quot;Oolite&quot; is a notable exception. Another successful adaptation is &quot;1337&quot; (meaning &quot;Elite&quot; in Leetspeak) developed by Jose Maria Enguita for the Oric machines, that won the &quot;2010 Oldschool Gaming Game Of The Year Award&quot;. Contrasting with these conversions, around 1999 Christian Pinder developed &quot;Elite: The New Kind&quot; as a modern PC port of the original BBC Micro version. He achieved a faithful port by reverse-engineering the original assembly written BBC Micro version and recreating a platform neutral C code variant from it, but at David Braben&#x27;s request this version was withdrawn from distribution in 2003. In September 2014, on &quot;Elite&quot;″s 30th birthday, Ian Bell blessed &quot;Elite: The New Kind&quot; and re-released it for free on his website. Since then, &quot;Elite: The New Kind&quot; is also distributed again in version 1.1 by Christian Pinder; a source code mirror is hosted on GitHub.

In 2020, Christian Pinder also released an upscaled Windows port of the Acorn Archimedes&#x27; Elite.

On 20 October 2013, the Internet Archive started to offer Elite in the ZX Spectrum version for online playing in the browser via MESS emulation.

<doc id="286775" wikidata="Q20137" url="?curid=286775" title="Touchpad">
<text>A touchpad or trackpad is a type of pointing device. Its largest component is a tactile sensor: an electronic device with a flat surface, that detects the motion and position of a user&#x27;s fingers, and translates them to 2D motion, to control a pointer in a graphical user interface on a computer screen. Touchpads are common on laptop computers, contrasted with desktop computers, where mice are more prevalent. Trackpads are sometimes used with desktop setups where desk space is scarce. Wireless touchpads are also available, as detached accessories. Due to the ability of trackpads to be made small, they were additionally used on personal digital assistants (PDAs) and some portable media players.

== Operation and function ==

Touchpads operate in several ways, including capacitive sensing or resistive touchscreen. The most common technology used in the 2010s senses the change of capacitance where a finger touches the pad. Capacitance-based touchpads will not sense the tip of a pencil or other similar ungrounded or non-conducting implements. Fingers insulated by a glove may also be problematic, and capacitive touchpads are rarely used as pointing devices for medical hardware.

Like touchscreens, touchpads sense absolute position but their resolution is limited by their size. For common use as a pointer device, the dragging motion of a finger is translated into a finer, relative motion of the cursor on the output to the display on the operating system, analogous to the handling of a mouse that is lifted and put back on a surface. Hardware buttons equivalent to a standard mouse&#x27;s left and right buttons are sometimes positioned adjacent to the touchpad.

Some touchpads and associated device driver software may interpret tapping the pad as a mouse click, and a tap followed by a continuous pointing motion (a &quot;click-and-a-half&quot;) can indicate dragging. Tactile touchpads allow for clicking and dragging by incorporating button functionality into the surface of the touchpad itself. To select, one presses down on the touchpad instead of a physical button. To drag, instead of performing the &quot;click-and-a-half&quot; technique, the user presses down while on the object, drags without releasing pressure, and lets go when done. Touchpad drivers can also allow the use of multiple fingers to emulate the other mouse buttons (commonly two-finger tapping for right click).

Touchpads are called clickpads if they rely on software buttons rather than physical buttons. Physically the whole clickpad formed a button, logically the driver interprets a click as a left or right button click depending on the placement of fingers.

Some touchpads have &quot;hotspots&quot;, locations on the touchpad used for functionality beyond a mouse. For example, on certain touchpads, moving the finger along an edge of the touch pad will act as a scroll wheel, controlling the scrollbar and scrolling the window that has the focus, vertically or horizontally. Many touchpads use two-finger dragging for scrolling. Also, some touchpad drivers support tap zones, regions where a tap will execute a function, for example, pausing a media player or launching an application. All of these functions are implemented in the touchpad device driver software, and can be disabled.

== History ==
In 1980, Xerox offered one of the first, if not first, touchpads on a computer system with their Xerox 860, a word processing workstation aimed at medium- and large-sized businesses. Embedded on the Xerox 860&#x27;s keyboard, to the right of the keys, is the circular touchpad, which Xerox dubbed the &quot;Cat&quot; (short for &quot;capacitance-activated transducer&quot;). Xerox offered the Cat as an alternative input method for selecting strings of text to copy, delete, insert, or move around the document.

By 1982, Apollo desktop computers were equipped with a touchpad on the right side of the keyboard. Introduced a year later, in 1983, the first battery-powered clamshell laptop, the Gavilan SC included a touchpad, which was mounted above its keyboard, rather than below, which became the norm.

Psion&#x27;s MC 200/400/600/WORD Series, introduced in 1989, came with a new mouse-replacing input device similar to a touchpad, although more closely resembling a graphics tablet, as the cursor was positioned by clicking on a specific point on the pad, instead of moving it in the direction of a stroke.

Laptops with touchpads were launched by Olivetti and Triumph-Adler in 1992. Cirque introduced the first widely available touchpad, branded as GlidePoint, in 1994. Apple introduced touchpads with modern placing in the PowerBook 500 series in 1994, using Cirque&#x27;s GlidePoint technology, which Apple refers to as a &quot;trackpad&quot;; it replaced the trackball of previous PowerBook models. Since 2008, Apple&#x27;s revisions of the MacBook and MacBook Pro incorporated a &quot;Tactile Touchpad&quot; design with a button integrated into the tracking surface (the lower part of the touchpad surface acts as a clickable button).

Another early adopter of the GlidePoint pointing device was Sharp. Later, Synaptics introduced their touchpad into the marketplace, branded the TouchPad, and Epson was an early adopter of this product with their ActionNote.
As touchpads began to be introduced in laptops in the 1990s, there was often confusion as to what the product should be called. No consistent term was used, and references varied, such as: glidepoint, touch sensitive input device, touchpad, trackpad, and pointing device.

Users were often presented with the option to purchase a pointing stick, touchpad, or trackball. Combinations of the devices were common, though touchpads and trackballs were rarely included together. Since the early 2000s, touchpads have become the dominant laptop pointing device as most consumer laptops produced during this period and beyond includes only touchpads, displacing the pointing stick.

== Use in devices ==
Touchpads are primarily used in self-contained portable laptop computers and do not require a flat surface near the machine. The touchpad is close to the keyboard, and relatively short finger movements are required to move the cursor across the display screen; while advantageous, this also makes it possible for a user&#x27;s palm or wrist to move the mouse cursor accidentally while typing. Laptops today feature multitouch touchpads that can sense in some cases up to five fingers simultaneously, providing more options for input, such as the ability to bring up the context menu by tapping two fingers, dragging two fingers for scrolling, or gestures for zoom in/out or rotate. The touchpads with physical buttons now are only hi-end business/professional laptops option.

One-dimensional touchpads are the primary control interface for menu navigation on iPod Classic portable music players and additional input method on some Wacom digitizer tablets, where they are referred to as &quot;click wheels&quot;, since they only sense motion along one axis, which is wrapped around like a wheel. Creative Labs also uses a touchpad for their Zen line of MP3 players, beginning with the Zen Touch. The second-generation Microsoft Zune product line (the Zune 80/120 and Zune 4/8) uses touch for the Zune Pad.

Touchpads also exist for desktop computers as an external peripheral, albeit rarely seen. But touchpad layer can be integrated with graphics tablet as additional input option.

External computer keyboards can be equipped with integrated touchpads (particularly keyboards oriented for HTPC use), and some keyboards can have only touch input surface instead of hardware buttons (a typical solution for clean rooms).

Optical trackpads primary can be used as part of ultraportable electronics; some handheld laptops and early smartphones can be equipped with optical trackpads.

On September 9, 2024, Apple unveiled the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max to feature the single one-dimensional trackpad next to the side button called &quot;Camera Control&quot; which allows the users to take an easier way to take a photos and videos, the force sensor to distinguish between the firm press and the light press and the capacitance touch sensor to distinguish sliding with finger for adjusting the zoom, exposure or depth-of-field.

== Theory of operation ==

There are two principal means by which touchpads work: the matrix approach and the capacitive shunt method. In the matrix approach, a series of conductors are arranged in an array of parallel lines in two layers, separated by an insulator and crossing each other at right angles to form a grid. A high frequency signal is applied sequentially between pairs in this two-dimensional grid array. The current that passes between the nodes is proportional to the capacitance. When a virtual ground, such as a finger, is placed over one of the intersections between the conductive layer some of the electrical field is shunted to this ground point, resulting in a change in the apparent capacitance at that location. This method received awarded to George Gerpheide in April 1994.

The capacitive shunt method, described in an application note by manufacturer Analog Devices, senses the change in capacitance between a transmitter and receiver that are on opposite sides of the sensor. The transmitter creates an electric field which oscillates at 200–300 kHz. If a ground point, such as the finger, is placed between the transmitter and receiver, some of the field lines are shunted away, decreasing the apparent capacitance.

Trackpads such as those found in some Blackberry smartphones work optically, like an optical computer mouse.

<doc id="286776" wikidata="Q307724" url="?curid=286776" title="Abdas of Susa">
<text>Abdas, (also Abda, Abdias, and Audas) was bishop of Susa in Iran. Socrates of Constantinople calls him &quot;bishop of Persia&quot;. He was executed under the orders of shah Yazdegerd I after refusing to rebuild a Zoroastrian fire temple that he had destroyed.

==Life==
Abdas was born in fourth-century Chaldor to a Zoroastrian mother, who educated him in matters of virtue. After Abdas reached adulthood, he was ordained a Christian priest, and built up in his hometown a monastery and a school, which grew to have around 60 teachers. Abdas baptized many converts in Chaldan, which caused the magi to arrest him. In prison, Abdas was subjected to humiliations, hunger and pain, but remained a Christian until his release. Abdas became a bishop in Susa.

Abdas was an associate of Maruthas of Martyropolis. Abdas is supposed to have helped Maruthas in driving out a demon from King Yezdegerd&#x27;s son. However, his impetuosity, put an end to the good relations between the Persian king and the Christian community. In , Abdas, in cooperation with a band of Christian priests and laymen, levelled a Zoroastrian fire temple, for which they were summoned to court to answer for their actions. Yazdegerd I reputedly asked Abdas; &quot;Since you are the chief and leader of these men, why do you allow them to despise our kingdom, to transgress against our command, and to act in accordance with their own will? Do you demolish and destroy our houses of worship and the foundations of our fire temples, which we have received from the fathers of our fathers to honor?&quot; While Abdas hesitated to answer, a priest in his entourage replied back, saying &quot;I demolished the foundation and extinguished the fire because it is not a house of God, nor is the fire the daughter of God.&quot; Demolishing a fire temple was reportedly a way of broadcasting the &quot;victory of Christianity.&quot; Abdas ultimately refused to have the fire temple rebuilt, and was as a result, he was subsequently executed.

Abdas&#x27; companions included the priests Hashu and Isaac, the secretary Ephrem, the hypodeacon Papa, the laymen Daduk and Durdan, and Papa, a brother of Abdas himself were also killed. His feast day is 16 May.

<text>The third USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot; (SSN-697), a , was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named for Indianapolis, Indiana. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 24 January 1972 and her keel was laid down on 19 October 1974. She was launched on 30 July 1977 sponsored by Esther Debra Bray (née Taylor), wife of former Congressman William G. Bray, and commissioned on 5 January 1980.

When &quot;Indianapolis&quot; was commissioned, many survivors of the cruiser were present for the official ceremony. The submarine&#x27;s home port was shifted to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in 1980, operating out of Pearl Harbor for the remainder of her active service. After the boat&#x27;s final deployment from April to October 1997, she was awarded the Battle Efficiency E and a Navy Unit Commendation. Both were the first time the submarine had received such awards in her 18-year history.
As a result of the ending of the Cold War and the so-called &quot;Peace Dividend&quot;, the boat was inactivated in 1998, only 18 years into her 30-year life.

The sail and other parts of &quot;Indianapolis (SSN 697)&quot; were dedicated as a memorial at the Indiana Military Museum in Vincennes, Indiana, on June 8, 2019. Attendees at the commemoration ceremony included former crewmen and officers of the boat&quot;.&quot;

Founded in 1900 as the Mack Brothers Company, it manufactured its first truck in 1905 and adopted its present name in 1922. Since 2000, Mack Trucks has been a subsidiary of Volvo, which purchased Mack and its former parent company Renault Véhicules Industriels.

Founded originally in Brooklyn in 1900, the company moved its headquarters to Allentown, Pennsylvania, five years later, in 1905. The company remained in Allentown for over a century, from 1905 until 2009. In 2009, the company relocated its headquarters to Greensboro, North Carolina. 

Mack products are produced in Lower Macungie, Pennsylvania, and Salem, Virginia. Its powertrain products are produced in its Hagerstown, Maryland, plant. Mack also maintains additional assembly plants in facilities in Pennsylvania, Australia, and Venezuela. The company also once maintained plants in Winnsboro, South Carolina, Hayward, California, and Oakville, Ontario, which are now closed.

==Operations==
The company&#x27;s manufacturing facilities are located at their Lehigh Valley Operations facility and division, formally known as the Macungie Assembly Operations Plant, in Macungie, Pennsylvania in the Lehigh Valley region of the state. Mack Trucks is the fourth-largest employer in the Lehigh Valley region as of 2024.

Mack Trucks is one of the top producers in the vocational and on-road vehicle market, class 8 through class 13. Mack trucks have been sold in 45 countries. Located near its former Allentown corporate headquarters in Macungie, Pennsylvania, the company&#x27;s manufacturing plant produces all Mack products, including Mack MP-series engines.

Mack transmissions, TC-15 transfer cases, and rear engine power take-offs are designed and manufactured in Hagerstown, Maryland, which was the original factory location.

Parts for Mack&#x27;s right-hand-drive vehicles are produced in Brisbane, Australia for worldwide distribution. Assembly for South America is performed in Macungie alongside the North American trucks. Mack no longer operates Mack de Venezuela C.A., in Caracas, Venezuela. The former Venezuela operation is a complete knock down (CKD) facility. Components were shipped from the United States to Caracas for final assembly.

In addition to its Macungie manufacturing facility, Mack also has a remanufacturing center in Middletown, Pennsylvania.

===2008 restructuring plan===
On August 14, 2008, Mack Trucks announced a major restructuring plan that included:
* Relocation of Mack&#x27;s head office, product development, most support functions, and purchasing functions to Greensboro, North Carolina, in 2009. Mack&#x27;s parent, Volvo Trucks, already has its North American base in Greensboro.
* Assembly of all produced Mack highway vehicles in Macungie, Pennsylvania, starting 2008
* Mack&#x27;s testing facility in Allentown, Pennsylvania being converted into a &quot;customer demonstration and reception center&quot; in 2010
* Restructuring the parts distribution network by 2010 (later delayed to first quarter 2011)

===Fire apparatus products===
Mack Trucks built complete fire apparatus in Allentown from 1911 until 1984. In addition to building pumpers, Mack also offered aerial trucks using ladder assemblies supplied by other manufacturers, notably American LaFrance and Canadian builder Pierre Thibault. Many still serve with fire departments around the world.

In the 1970s, Mack started selling their chassis to other fire apparatus manufacturers. Production of Mack-chassised fire trucks continues for use in fire departments throughout North America and around the world.

===Previous models===

====AC====
The heavy-duty AC, with its well-known tapered hood, was the truck which started the bulldog theme. A 4 cylinder gasoline engine 4X2 with chain drive, it was strong, reliable, and worked well in rough terrain. Introduced in 1916, there was a great demand because of World War I, over 6000 -, -, and -ton trucks were built for the UK and US military. There were also commercial sales from 1916; the AC was well suited for logging and construction work. A larger version, the AP, built between 1926 and 1938, was an off-road haul truck used on Boulder Dam and other large projects. 40,299 ACs had been built when production ended in 1939.

====N Series====
The N Series was Mack&#x27;s first military design, large 6 and -ton 6X6 artillery prime movers. Between its development in the late 1930s and the beginning of production in 1940 US military requirements changed and the truck was not needed. All NMs and most of the larger NOs were exported as foreign aid. After World War II the NO was developed into the successful M 123 semi-tractor. 

====B series====
The Mack B series models were Mack&#x27;s primary vehicle from its introduction in 1953 until it was replaced by the R Series in 1966. They ranged in size from the medium duty B20P gas powered 4X2 to the oversized B873SX turbo-diesel 6X6. B Models were commonly used as semi tractors and in the construction industry. They were also used as fire engines and trucks, sometimes with the roof of the cab removed. 127,786 B Models were built.

====R/RB/RD/RL/RM/RW, U, DM/DMM series====

Mack started to produce the Mack R series (R, RW, and U models) in 1966 for highway use, and the RD, DM, and all wheel drive RM and DMM models for construction use. The lightweight RL model followed in 1967, the RW Superliner with a large, rectangular hood and grill in 1977, and the setback front axle RB in the 1990s. All these models featured the same cab; the U, DM, and DMM had the cab offset to the left.

In the 1990s, the R, RW, and U series models were discontinued and the RB was introduced, mostly for severe-duty applications. The hood was modified slightly for the model RB. 2004 was the last year for the RD, and 2006 for the RB and DM. The DM was the last model to use this cab style, and was the last model of this family to be produced.

As a replacement for the construction models, Mack started to offer the Granite, Granite Bridge-Formula and Granite Axle-back.

Also this model is serving in the Mexican Army as a Troop and Utility Truck in configuration 6X6 OR 6X4

===Engines===
By 1916 Mack was producing 4- and 6-cylinder gasoline engines, and through 2014 continued to offer their own, in the form of three diesel I6s. Engines by other manufacturers were often optional, supplied over the years by Caterpillar, Cummins, Chrysler, Detroit Diesel, Hercules, Scania, and Waukesha.

Mack started making diesels in 1938, in 1957 the END and turbocharged ENDT 673 diesel were introduced. This I6 engine family was successful, and remained in production for over 30 years.

In the early 1960s, Walter May, executive vice president of product and engineering at Mack Trucks HQ in Allentown, PA., prioritized research and development of a high-torque rise engine. Winton Pelizzoni, chief engineer at the Mack Trucks powertrain facility in Hagerstown, MD., designed an innovative engine based on this concept and then led development of the prototype that went into production. The engine was introduced as an inline six in 1966, as a V8 in 1970, and as the intercooled inline six 300 series in 1973. This was an industry-changing event. The Maxidyne, with an operating range of 1200–2100 R.P.M, and later 1050–1700 R.P.M., allowed a heavy Class 8 truck to be operated with a 5 speed (Maxitorque) transmission. Previously, heavy trucks typically operated between 1800–2100R.P.M. and were equipped with 10 or more gears.

In 2014 Mack offers three engine series, the 11 L MP 7, 13 L MP8, and 16 L MP10, with to and to .

===Other products===
Mack also produced railroad cars and locomotives between 1905 and 1930. The company additionally produced several railbus models.

==Trademark==
The company&#x27;s trademark is the bulldog, which can be found on the front of almost all Mack trucks. A gold-plated bulldog indicates the truck came with all Mack drivetrain including the engine, transmission and axles.

Mack trucks earned their nickname during World War I, when the British government purchased the Mack AC for supplying its front lines. Its pugnacious, blunt-nosed hood, tenacious performance, and durability, reminded the soldiers of their country&#x27;s mascot, the British Bulldog.
The logo was first used in 1921 for the AB chain drive models and became the official corporate logo in 1922.

==Leadership==
==Military models==
===World War II===
Mack built over 35,000 heavy duty military trucks during World War II, most for export under Lend-Lease. None were US Army standard types, all were designed and built exclusively by Mack.

The EH series was a commercial design 5 ton (4,500 kg) 4x2 adapted for military service. The EH, EHU (cabover) and semi-tractor models EHT and EHUT were used by the US Army in Europe. Over 2,400 were built in 1942.
The LMSW was a commercial design 10 ton (9,070 kg) 6x4 chassis adapted for military wreckers, most were exported to Great Britain.
The NJU (G-639) series were military design 5 ton (5,450 kg) 4x4 semi-tractors used to tow bridging pontoons and equipment. Several other manufactures built standardized models of similar trucks, so only 700 were produced in 1941–1942.
The NM (G-535) and NO (G-532) series were military design 6 ton (5,443 kg) and ton (6,800 kg) 6x6 artillery prime movers. All NMs and most of the larger NOs were exported as foreign aid. Over 8,400 NMs and 2,000 NOs were built between 1940 and 1944.
The NR series were military design 10 ton (5,440 kg) 6x4 cargo trucks. Intended for British use in North Africa, they had Mack ED diesel engines, making them valuable for long-distance trips. Over 15,000 were built between 1940 and 1944.
===Post World War II===
Since World War II, Mack has had limited military production.

The M39 (G-744) series, which includes the M54 cargo truck, were a standardized military design 5 ton (4,540 kg) 6x6 chassis, with many models. Mack developed a competing design, when the M39 was standardized Mack built a relatively small number of M51 dump trucks. In the early 1960s they took part in a short lived program to retrofit some of the series with Mack END 672 engines.

The M123 and M125 (G-792) were standardized military design 10 ton (9,070 kg) 6x6 semi tractors and artillery prime movers. Designed by Mack, using many components from the NO series. Mack built 392 M123s, used with a lowboy trailer to recover and transport tanks, and all 552 M125s, between 1955 and 1957. Later follow-up orders called for 420 M123s and retrofitted 210 more with Cummins engines.

<doc id="286788" wikidata="Q2481895" url="?curid=286788" title="Galilean invariance">
<text>Galilean invariance or Galilean relativity states that the laws of motion are the same in all inertial frames of reference. Galileo Galilei first described this principle in 1632 in his &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot; using the example of a ship travelling at constant velocity, without rocking, on a smooth sea; any observer below the deck would not be able to tell whether the ship was moving or stationary.

==Formulation==
Specifically, the term &quot;Galilean invariance&quot; today usually refers to this principle as applied to Newtonian mechanics, that is, Newton&#x27;s laws of motion hold in all frames related to one another by a Galilean transformation. In other words, all frames related to one another by such a transformation are inertial (meaning, Newton&#x27;s equation of motion is valid in these frames). In this context it is sometimes called &quot;Newtonian relativity&quot;.

Among the axioms from Newton&#x27;s theory are:
#There exists an &quot;absolute space&quot;, in which Newton&#x27;s laws are true. An inertial frame is a reference frame in relative uniform motion to absolute space.
#All inertial frames share a &quot;universal time&quot;.

Galilean relativity can be shown as follows. Consider two inertial frames &quot;S&quot; and &quot;S&#x27; &quot;. A physical event in &quot;S&quot; will have position coordinates &quot;r&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) and time &quot;t&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;r&#x27; &quot; = (&quot;x&#x27; &quot;, &quot;y&#x27; &quot;, &quot;z&#x27; &quot;) and time &quot;t&#x27; &quot; in &quot;S&#x27; &quot;. By the second axiom above, one can synchronize the clock in the two frames and assume &quot;t&quot; = &quot;t&#x27; &quot;. Suppose &quot;S&#x27; &quot; is in relative uniform motion to &quot;S&quot; with velocity &quot;v&quot;. Consider a point object whose position is given by functions &quot;r&#x27; &quot;(&quot;t&quot;) &quot; in &quot;S&#x27; &quot; and r&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) in &quot;S&quot;. We see that
:formula_1

The velocity of the particle is given by the time derivative of the position:
:formula_2

Another differentiation gives the acceleration in the two frames:
:formula_3

It is this simple but crucial result that implies Galilean relativity. Assuming that mass is invariant in all inertial frames, the above equation shows Newton&#x27;s laws of mechanics, if valid in one frame, must hold for all frames. But it is assumed to hold in absolute space, therefore Galilean relativity holds.

===Newton&#x27;s theory versus special relativity===
A comparison can be made between Newtonian relativity and special relativity.

Some of the assumptions and properties of Newton&#x27;s theory are:
#The existence of infinitely many inertial frames. Each frame is of infinite size (the entire universe may be covered by many linearly equivalent frames). Any two frames may be in relative uniform motion. (The relativistic nature of mechanics derived above shows that the absolute space assumption is not necessary.)
#The inertial frames may move in &quot;all&quot; possible relative forms of uniform motion.
#There is a universal, or absolute, notion of elapsed time.
#Two inertial frames are related by a Galilean transformation.
#In all inertial frames, Newton&#x27;s laws, and gravity, hold.

In comparison, the corresponding statements from special relativity are as follows:
#The existence, as well, of infinitely many non-inertial frames, each of which referenced to (and physically determined by) a unique set of spacetime coordinates. Each frame may be of infinite size, but its definition is always determined locally by contextual physical conditions. Any two frames may be in relative non-uniform motion (as long as it is assumed that this condition of relative motion implies a relativistic dynamical effect – and later, mechanical effect in general relativity – between both frames).
#Rather than freely allowing all conditions of relative uniform motion between frames of reference, the relative velocity between two inertial frames becomes bounded above by the speed of light.
#Instead of universal elapsed time, each inertial frame possesses its own notion of elapsed time.
#The Galilean transformations are replaced by Lorentz transformations.
#In all inertial frames, &quot;all&quot; laws of physics are the same.

Both theories assume the existence of inertial frames. In practice, the size of the frames in which they remain valid differ greatly, depending on gravitational tidal forces.

In the appropriate context, a &quot;local Newtonian inertial frame&quot;, where Newton&#x27;s theory remains a good model, extends to roughly 107 light years.

In special relativity, one considers &quot;Einstein&#x27;s cabins&quot;, cabins that fall freely in a gravitational field. According to Einstein&#x27;s thought experiment, a man in such a cabin experiences (to a good approximation) no gravity and therefore the cabin is an approximate inertial frame. However, one has to assume that the size of the cabin is sufficiently small so that the gravitational field is approximately parallel in its interior. This can greatly reduce the sizes of such approximate frames, in comparison to Newtonian frames. For example, an artificial satellite orbiting the Earth can be viewed as a cabin. However, reasonably sensitive instruments could detect &quot;microgravity&quot; in such a situation because the &quot;lines of force&quot; of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field converge.

In general, the convergence of gravitational fields in the universe dictates the scale at which one might consider such (local) inertial frames. For example, a spaceship falling into a black hole or neutron star would (at a certain distance) be subjected to tidal forces strong enough to crush it in width and tear it apart in length. In comparison, however, such forces might only be uncomfortable for the astronauts inside (compressing their joints, making it difficult to extend their limbs in any direction perpendicular to the gravity field of the star). Reducing the scale further, the forces at that distance might have almost no effects at all on a mouse. This illustrates the idea that all freely falling frames are locally inertial (acceleration and gravity-free) if the scale is chosen correctly.

===Electromagnetism===
There are two consistent Galilean transformations that may be used with electromagnetic fields in certain situations. 

A transformation formula_4 is not consistent if formula_5 where formula_6 and formula_7 are velocities. A consistent transformation will produce the same results when transforming to a new velocity in one step or multiple steps. It is not possible to have a consistent Galilean transformation that transforms both the magnetic and electric fields. There are useful consistent Galilean transformations that may be applied whenever either the magnetic field or the electric field is dominant.

====Magnetic field system====
Magnetic field systems are those systems in which the electric field in the initial frame of reference is insignificant, but the magnetic field is strong. When the magnetic field is dominant and the relative velocity, formula_8, is low, then the following transformation may be useful:

formula_9 
where formula_10 is free current density, formula_11 is magnetization density. The electric field is transformed under this transformation when changing frames of reference, but the magnetic field and related quantities are unchanged. An example of this situation is a wire is moving in a magnetic field such as would occur in an ordinary generator or motor. The transformed electric field in the moving frame of reference could induce current in the wire.

====Electric field system====
Electric field systems are those systems in which the magnetic field in the initial frame of reference is insignificant, but the electric field is strong. When the electric field is dominant and the relative velocity, formula_12, is low, then the following transformation may be useful:

formula_13 

where formula_14 is free charge density, formula_15 is polarization density. The magnetic field and free current density are transformed under this transformation when changing frames of reference, but the electric field and related quantities are unchanged

==Work, kinetic energy, and momentum==

Because the distance covered while applying a force to an object depends on the inertial frame of reference, so depends the work done. Due to Newton&#x27;s law of reciprocal actions there is a reaction force; it does work depending on the inertial frame of reference in an opposite way. The total work done is independent of the inertial frame of reference.

Correspondingly the kinetic energy of an object, and even the change in this energy due to a change in velocity, depends on the inertial frame of reference. The total kinetic energy of an isolated system also depends on the inertial frame of reference: it is the sum of the total kinetic energy in a center-of-momentum frame and the kinetic energy the total mass would have if it were concentrated in the center of mass. Due to the conservation of momentum the latter does not change with time, so changes with time of the total kinetic energy do not depend on the inertial frame of reference.

By contrast, while the momentum of an object also depends on the inertial frame of reference, its change due to a change in velocity does not.

<doc id="286789" wikidata="Q7726828" url="?curid=286789" title="The Colophon, A Book Collectors' Quarterly">
<text>The Colophon, subtitled &quot;A Book Collectors&#x27; Quarterly&quot; or &quot;A quarterly for booklovers,&quot; was a limited edition quarterly periodical begun late in 1929 and continuing in various guises until 1950. It was the brainchild of Elmer Adler (1884–1962), founder of Pynson Printers of New York City. His idea was that various printers around the world would be willing to contribute their time and expertise to produce signatures (articles) using their own choice of papers, typography and illustration. These articles would then be bound together in boards by Pynson Printers and marketed to 2,000 subscribers.

==Content==
Some articles comment on a current or historical issue related to printing, publishing or art. Other articles were themselves intended to be an example of printing or a work of art. As each article or item was normally a short section produced by a different designer and printer, a typical issue included a range of styles, papers, and typography, often using unusual or experimental approaches not widely seen in longer or mainstream printed items.

Each issue would also include an original piece of graphic art, some signed by the artist, many produced by using etching, lithography, or engraving. Some of these are rare and valuable; as a result, some copies of the bound volumes have been vandalized to remove the prints.

==Editorial board==
Adler gathered around him an editorial board of John T. Winterich, Alfred Stanford and F.B. Adams, Jr. and contributing editors including Rockwell Kent, W. A. Dwiggins, Frederic Goudy, Dard Hunter, Bruce Rogers, A. Edward Newton and many others who were well known in the book world. It was their responsibility to provide not only editorial expertise but articles (and in the case of Rockwell Kent, &quot;The Colophon&quot; logos and colophons).

==Publication history==
Beginning in early 1930, this &quot;adventure in enthusiasm&quot;, as Adler called it, was greeted with public enthusiasm as well, requiring a waiting list for subscriptions. However, it soon ran into difficulty as the Depression made the then costly subscription price of $15 per year difficult for many. By 1935, only 1,700 subscribers could be found. Nonetheless, the quality of &quot;The Colophon&quot; remained unsurpassed—through the good will of printers, authors and artists—as well as with the help of a number of anonymous financial gifts. From 1935 to 1938, &quot;The Colophon&quot; entered a new phase with less lofty production values (at a price of $6&lt;Notice given to subscribers which was included in the last two issues of the original &#x27;The Colophon&#x27;. per year), before returning to a higher level of quality in 1939 with the &#x27;New Graphic Series&#x27;. Starting again in 1948, the name &quot;The New Colophon: A Book Collectors&#x27; Quarterly&quot; was used by Philip Duschnes and the quarterly was entirely printed by the Anthoensen Press of Portland, Maine, continuing publication until 1950 in a fourth and final format.

==Contributors==
Many of the writers of the day, such as Sherwood Anderson and Edith Wharton, wrote autobiographical articles about their first books and many artists now famous, such as Paul Landacre, Gustave Baumann, Howard Cook, and Emil Ganso, provided original prints.

== Issues ==

<text>A trauma center, or trauma centre, is a hospital equipped and staffed to provide care for patients suffering from major traumatic injuries such as falls, motor vehicle collisions, or gunshot wounds. The term &quot;trauma center&quot; may be used incorrectly to refer to an emergency department (also known as a &quot;casualty department&quot; or &quot;accident and emergency&quot;) that lacks the presence of specialized services or certification to care for victims of major trauma.

In the United States, a hospital can receive trauma center status by meeting specific criteria established by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and passing a site review by the Verification Review Committee. Official designation as a trauma center is determined by individual state law provisions. Trauma centers vary in their specific capabilities and are identified by &quot;Level&quot; designation, Level I (Level-1) being the highest and Level III (Level-3) being the lowest (some states have four or five designated levels).

The highest levels of trauma centers have access to specialist medical and nursing care, including emergency medicine, trauma surgery, critical care, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, anesthesiology, and radiology, as well as a wide variety of highly specialized and sophisticated surgical and diagnostic equipment. The point of a trauma center, as distinguished from an ordinary hospital, is to maintain the ability to rush critically injured patients into surgery during the golden hour by ensuring that appropriate personnel and equipment are always ready to go on short notice. Lower levels of trauma centers may be able to provide only initial care and stabilization of a traumatic injury and arrange for transfer of the patient to a higher level of trauma care.

The operation of a trauma center is often expensive and some areas may be underserved by trauma centers because of that expense. As there is no way to schedule the need for emergency services, patient traffic at trauma centers can vary widely.

A trauma center may have a helipad for receiving patients that have been airlifted to the hospital. In some cases, persons injured in remote areas and transported to a distant trauma center by helicopter can receive faster and better medical care than if they had been transported by ground ambulance to a closer hospital that does not have a designated trauma center.

== History ==
===United Kingdom===
Trauma centres grew into existence out of the realisation that traumatic injury is a disease process unto itself requiring specialised and experienced multidisciplinary treatment and specialised resources. The world&#x27;s first trauma centre, the first hospital to be established specifically to treat injured rather than ill patients, was the Birmingham Accident Hospital, which opened in Birmingham, England in 1941 after a series of studies found that the treatment of injured persons within England was inadequate. By 1947, the hospital had three trauma teams, each including two surgeons and an anaesthetist, and a burns team with three surgeons. The hospital became part of the National Health Service in its formation in July 1948 and closed in 1993. 

===United States===


According to the CDC, injuries are the leading cause of death for American children and young adults ages 1–19. The leading causes of trauma are motor vehicle collisions, falls, and assaults with a deadly weapon.

In the United States, Robert J. Baker and Robert J. Freeark established the first civilian Shock Trauma Unit at Cook County Hospital (opened 1834) in Chicago, Illinois on March 16, 1966. The concept of a shock trauma center was also developed at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, in the 1950s and 1960s by thoracic surgeon and shock researcher R Adams Cowley, who founded what became the Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 1, 1966. The R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center is one of the first shock trauma centers in the world. Cook County Hospital in Chicago trauma center (opened in 1966). David R. Boyd interned at Cook County Hospital from 1963 to 1964 before being drafted into the Army of the United States of America. Upon his release from the Army, Boyd became the first shock-trauma fellow at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, and then went on to develop the National System for Emergency Medical Services, under President Ford. In 1968 the American Trauma Society was created by various co-founders, including R Adams Cowley and Rene Joyeuse as they saw the importance of increased education and training of emergency providers and for nationwide quality trauma care.

===Canada===
According to the founder of the Trauma Unit at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Marvin Tile, &quot;the nature of injuries at Sunnybrook has changed over the years. When the trauma centre first opened in 1976, about 98 per cent of patients suffered from blunt-force trauma caused by accidents and falls. Now, as many as 20 per cent of patients arrive with gunshot and knife wounds&quot;.

Fraser Health Authority in British Columbia, located at Royal Columbian Hospital and Abbotsford Regional Hospital, services the BC area, &quot;Each year, Fraser Health treats almost 130,000 trauma patients as part of the integrated B.C. trauma system&quot;.

==Current system in the United Kingdom==
The NHS has 27 major trauma centres in England, four in Scotland, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland. The UK system operates on a &quot;hub and spoke&quot; model with regional trauma networks headed by a Major Trauma Centre (MTC) and supported by trauma units (TU&#x27;s).

===Major Trauma Centre===
Major trauma centres are very similar to Level I trauma centers in the U.S., with teams of specialized care available around the clock to treat patients with injuries of all possible severity. MTCs can be designated as &quot;adult only&quot;, &quot;children&#x27;s only&quot; or &quot;adult and children&quot; to identify what patients they are prepared to treat.

===Trauma Unit===
Trauma units can play two roles, the first being to care for those who are less seriously injured to avoid over consumption of resources in major trauma centres. The other being to stabilize then transfer severely injured patients, especially when they are too far from an MTC to be directly taken there safely.

==Definitions in United States==
In the United States, trauma centers are certified by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) or local state governments, from Level I (comprehensive service) to Level III (limited-care). The different levels refer to the types of resources available in a trauma center and the number of patients admitted yearly. These are categories that define national standards for trauma care in hospitals. Level I through Level II designations are also given adult or pediatric designations. Additionally, some states have their own trauma-center rankings separate from that of the ACS. These levels may range from Level I to Level IV. Some hospitals are less-formally designated Level V.

The ACS does not &quot;officially&quot; designate hospitals as trauma centers. Numerous U.S. hospitals that are not verified by ACS claim trauma center designation. Most states have legislation that determines the process for designation of trauma centers within that state. The ACS describes this responsibility as &quot;a geopolitical process by which empowered entities, government or otherwise, are authorized to designate.&quot; The ACS&#x27;s self-appointed mission is limited to confirming and reporting on any given hospital&#x27;s ability to comply with the ACS standard of care known as &quot;Resources for Optimal Care of the Injured Patient&quot;.

The Trauma Information Exchange Program (TIEP) is a program of the American Trauma Society in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Center for Injury Research and Policy and is funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. TIEP maintains an inventory of trauma centers in the US, collects data and develops information related to the causes, treatment and outcomes of injury, and facilitates the exchange of information among trauma care institutions, care providers, researchers, payers and policymakers.

A trauma center is a hospital that is designated by a state or local authority or is verified by the American College of Surgeons.

=== Level I ===
A Level I trauma center provides the highest level of surgical care to trauma patients. Being treated at a Level I trauma center can reduce mortality by 25% compared to a non-trauma center. It has a full range of specialists and equipment available 24 hours a day and admits a minimum required annual volume of severely injured patients.

A Level I trauma center is required to have a certain number of the following people on duty 24 hours a day at the hospital:

:* surgeons
:* emergency physicians
:* anesthesiologists
:* nurses
:* respiratory therapists
:* an education program
:* preventive and outreach programs.

Key elements include 24‑hour in‑house coverage by general surgeons and prompt availability of care in varying specialties—such as orthopedic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, anesthesiology, emergency medicine, radiology, internal medicine, otolaryngology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and critical care, which are needed to adequately respond and care for various forms of trauma that a patient may suffer, as well as provide rehabilitation services. 

Most Level I trauma centers are teaching hospitals/campuses. Additionally, a Level I center has a program of research, is a leader in trauma education and injury prevention, and is a referral resource for communities in nearby regions.

Level I and II trauma centers are focused on maintaining the capability &quot;to take a patient to the operating room immediately 24/7/365&quot;. This requires careful management of hospital resources to ensure their constant availability around the clock. For example, elective surgeries must be booked in such a way as to leave gaps in the schedule, to ensure that at least one fully-equipped operating room is always available for immediate use by the trauma service at all times. 

A trauma center must ensure that a general or trauma surgeon can respond to a patient&#x27;s bedside within 15 minutes of notification at least 80% of the time. To satisfy this requirement, most Level I and many Level II centers have a surgeon in-house at all times, and there is usually another surgeon on backup (that is, on call to respond from home) if needed. They also have a surgical nurse and scrub technician or two surgical nurses in-house at all times to support the trauma surgeon on duty. These surgical personnel must be supported by a complete trauma team of nurses and technicians in the emergency department able to care for, support, and safely transport critically ill patients through the hospital. Nurses on a trauma team are often the most experienced nurses in the emergency department, with extensive training in critical care skills such as advanced airway management and rapid delivery of blood transfusions. 

Other specialists do not need to be in-house at the trauma center on a 24/7/365 basis, but they also must be carefully managed to avoid occupational burnout and to ensure consistent rapid response when on call. For example, neurosurgeons are notoriously scarce and will burn out if there are not enough of them on call for a trauma center to share the workload.

=== Level II ===
A Level II trauma center works in collaboration with a Level I center. It provides comprehensive trauma care and supplements the clinical expertise of a Level I institution. It provides 24-hour availability of all essential specialties, personnel, and equipment. Oftentimes, level II centers possess critical care services capable of caring for almost all injury types indefinitely. Minimum volume requirements may depend on local conditions. Such institutions are not required to have an ongoing program of research or a surgical residency program.

=== Level III ===
A Level III trauma center does not have the full availability of specialists but has resources for emergency resuscitation, surgery, and intensive care of most trauma patients. A Level III center has transfer agreements with Level I or Level II trauma centers that provide back-up resources for the care of patients with exceptionally severe injuries, such as multiple trauma.

=== Level IV ===
A Level IV trauma center exists in some states in which the resources do not exist for a Level III trauma center. It provides initial evaluation, stabilization, diagnostic capabilities, and transfer to a higher level of care. It may also provide surgery and critical-care services, as defined in the scope of services for trauma care. A trauma-trained nurse is immediately available, and physicians are available upon the patient&#x27;s arrival in the Emergency Department. Transfer agreements exist with other trauma centers of higher levels, for use when conditions warrant a transfer.

=== Level V ===
A Level V trauma center provides initial evaluation, stabilization, diagnostic capabilities, and transfer to a higher level of care. They may provide surgical and critical-care services, as defined in the service&#x27;s scope of trauma care services. A trauma-trained nurse is immediately available, and physicians are available upon patient arrival in the emergency department. If not open 24 hours daily, the facility must have an after-hours trauma response protocol.

=== Pediatric trauma centers ===
A facility can be designated an adult trauma center, a pediatric trauma center, or an adult and pediatric trauma center. If a hospital provides trauma care to both adult and pediatric patients, the level designation may not be the same for each group. For example, a Level I adult trauma center may also be a Level II pediatric trauma center because pediatric trauma surgery is a specialty unto itself. Adult trauma surgeons are not generally specialized in providing surgical trauma care to children and vice versa, and the difference in practice is significant. In contrast to adult trauma centers, pediatric trauma centers only have two ratings, either level I or level II.

<doc id="286796" wikidata="Q409482" url="?curid=286796" title="Benzophenone">
<text>Benzophenone is a naturally occurring organic compound with the formula (C6H5)2CO, generally abbreviated Ph2CO. Benzophenone has been found in some fungi, fruits and plants, including grapes. It is a white solid with a low melting point and rose-like odor that is soluble in organic solvents. Benzophenone is the simplest diaromatic ketone. It is a widely used building block in organic chemistry, being the parent diarylketone.

==History==
Carl Graebe of the University of Königsberg, in an early literature report from 1874, described working with benzophenone.
==Uses==
Benzophenone can be used as a photo initiator in ultraviolet (UV)-curing applications such as inks, imaging, and clear coatings in the printing industry. Benzophenone prevents UV light from damaging scents and colors in products such as perfumes and soaps.

Benzophenone can also be added to plastic packaging as a UV blocker to prevent photo-degradation of the packaging polymers or its contents. Its use allows manufacturers to package the product in clear glass or plastic (such as a PETE water bottle). Without it, opaque or dark packaging would be required.

In biological applications, benzophenones have been used extensively as photophysical probes to identify and map peptide–protein interactions.

Benzophenone is used as an additive in flavorings or perfumes for &quot;sweet-woody-geranium-like notes.&quot;

==Synthesis==
Benzophenone is produced by the copper-catalyzed oxidation of diphenylmethane with air.

A laboratory route involves the reaction of benzene with carbon tetrachloride followed by hydrolysis of the resulting diphenyldichloromethane. It can also be prepared by Friedel–Crafts acylation of benzene with benzoyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid (e.g. aluminium chloride) catalyst: since benzoyl chloride can itself be produced by the reaction of benzene with phosgene the first synthesis proceeded directly from those materials.

Another route of synthesis is through a palladium(II)/oxometalate catalyst. This converts an alcohol to a ketone with two groups on each side.

Another, less well-known reaction to produce benzophenone is the pyrolysis of anhydrous calcium benzoate.

==Organic chemistry==

Benzophenone is a common photosensitizer in photochemistry. It crosses from the S1 state into the triplet state with nearly 100% yield. The resulting diradical will abstract a hydrogen atom from a suitable hydrogen donor to form a ketyl radical.

===Radical anion===


Alkali metals reduce benzophenone to the deeply blue colored radical anion, diphenylketyl:
:M + Ph2CO → M&amp;hairsp;+&amp;hairsp;Ph2CO•−

Generally sodium is used as the alkali metal. Sodium-benzophenone ketyl is used in the purification of organic solvents, particularly ethers, because it reacts with water and oxygen to give non-volatile products. Adsorbents such as alumina, silica gel, and especially molecular sieves are superior and far safer. The sodium-benzophenone method is common since it gives a visual indication that water, oxygen, and peroxides are absent from the solvent. Large scale purification may be more economical using devices which utilize adsorbents such as the aforementioned alumina or molecular sieves. The ketyl is soluble in the organic solvent being dried, which leads to faster purification. In comparison, sodium is insoluble, and its heterogeneous reaction is much slower. When excess alkali metal is present a second reduction may occur, resulting in a color transformation from deep blue to purple:
:M + M&amp;hairsp;+&amp;hairsp;Ph2CO•− → (M&amp;hairsp;+)2(Ph2CO)2−

==Commercially significant derivatives and analogues==
There are over 300 natural benzophenones, with great structural diversity and biological activities. They are being investigated as potential sources of new drugs. Substituted benzophenones such as oxybenzone and dioxybenzone are used in many sunscreens. The use of benzophenone-derivatives which structurally resemble a strong photosensitizer has been criticized (see sunscreen controversy).

Michler&#x27;s ketone has dimethylamino substituents at each &quot;para&quot; position. The high-strength polymer PEEK is prepared from derivatives of benzophenone.

2-Amino-5-chlorobenzophenone is used in the synthesis of benzodiazepines.

==Safety==
It is considered &quot;essentially nontoxic.&quot; Benzophenone is however banned as a food additive by the US Food and Drug Administration, despite the FDA&#x27;s continuing stance that this chemical does not pose a risk to public health under the conditions of its intended use. 

The European Union permits it as a flavouring substance, having established a Total Dietary Intake of 0.3mg/kg of body weight per day.

Benzophenone derivatives are known to be pharmacologically active. From a molecular chemistry point of view interaction of benzophenone with B-DNA has been demonstrated experimentally. The interaction with DNA and the successive photo-induced energy transfer is at the base of the benzophenone activity as a DNA photosensitizer and may explain part of its therapeutic potentialities.

In 2014, benzophenones were named Contact Allergen of the Year by the American Contact Dermatitis Society.

Benzophenone is an endocrine disruptor capable of binding to the pregnane X receptor.

<text>Clarke Abel (5 September 1780 – 24 November 1826) was a British surgeon and naturalist. 

He accompanied Lord Amherst on his mission to China in 1816-17 as the embassy&#x27;s chief medical officer and naturalist, on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks. The mission was Britain&#x27;s second unsuccessful attempt to establish diplomatic relations with China and involved travelling to the Beijing and the famous botanical gardens of Fa Tee (Huadi) near Canton (Fangcun District). 
While in China, Abel collected specimens and seeds of the plant that carries his name, &quot;Abelia chinensis&quot;, described by Banks&#x27; botanical secretary Robert Brown, &quot;with friendly partiality&quot;. However a shipwreck and an attack by pirates on the way back to his home in Britain caused him to lose all of his specimens. Abel&#x27;s &quot;Narrative of a Journey in the Interior of China&quot;, 1818, gives a detailed account of the collection&#x27;s misfortunes. However, he had left some specimens with Sir George Staunton at Canton, who was kind enough to return them to him; living specimens of the Chinese Abelia that we know today were introduced by Robert Fortune in 1844.

In March 1819 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was also a member of the Geological Society.

Abel was the first Western scientist to report the presence of the orangutan on the island of Sumatra; the Sumatran Orangutan &quot;Pongo abelii&quot; Lesson 1827 is named for him. He went on to become the surgeon-in-chief to Lord Amherst when the earl was appointed Governor-general of India. Abel died at Cawnpore, India, 24 November 1826, aged 46.

Abel was also the first scientist to describe the Chiru or Tibetan Antelope, in 1826. It is the only member of the genus Pantholops.

In 1919, botanist Takenoshin Nakai published &quot;Abeliophyllum&quot;, which is a genus of shrubs from Korea, in the olive family, Oleaceae. It was named in Clarke Abel&#x27;s honour. Then in 2010, Landrein published &quot;Diabelia&quot;, which is a genus of shrubs from China and Korea, in the Caprifoliaceae family.

<text>In emergency medicine, the golden hour is the period of time immediately after a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood that prompt medical and surgical treatment will prevent death. While initially defined as an hour, the exact time period depends on the nature of the injury and can be more than or less than this duration. It is well established that the person&#x27;s chances of survival are greatest if they receive care within a short period of time after a severe injury; however, there is no evidence to suggest that survival rates drop off after 60 minutes. Some have come to use the term to refer to the core principle of rapid intervention in trauma cases, rather than the narrow meaning of a critical one-hour time period.

==General concept==
Cases of severe trauma, especially internal bleeding, require surgical intervention. Complications such as shock may occur if the person is not managed appropriately and expeditiously. It therefore becomes a priority to transport people with severe trauma as fast as possible to specialists, most often found at a hospital trauma center, for treatment. Because some injuries can cause people to deteriorate extremely rapidly, the lag time between injury and treatment should ideally be kept to a bare minimum; this has come to be specified as no more than 60 minutes, after which time the survival rate for people who have sustained trauma is alleged to fall off dramatically.

The recommended amount of time for emergency medical services is less than 10 minutes at the location of the trauma before transporting.

==Origins of the term==
R Adams Cowley is credited with promoting this concept, first in his capacity as a military surgeon and later as head of the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center. The concept of the &quot;Golden Hour&quot; may have been derived from the French military&#x27;s World War I data. The R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center section of the University of Maryland Medical Center&#x27;s website quotes Cowley as saying, &quot;There is a golden hour between life and death. If you are critically injured you have less than 60 minutes to survive. You might not die right then; it may be three days or two weeks later — but something has happened in your body that is irreparable.&quot;

==Controversy==
While most medical professionals agree that delays in definitive care are undesirable as they may lead to significant increases in morbidity and mortality, research casts doubt on the validity of the golden hour as it appears to lack a scientific basis. Bryan Bledsoe, a physician and outspoken critic of the golden hour and other controversial medical topics, such as critical incident stress management, has said that the peer-reviewed medical literature does not demonstrate any &quot;magical time&quot; for saving critical patients. There are different critical periods for different injuries.

<text>A catalytic converter is an exhaust emission control device which converts toxic gases and pollutants in exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine into less-toxic pollutants by catalyzing a redox reaction. Catalytic converters are usually used with internal combustion engines fueled by gasoline or diesel, including lean-burn engines, and sometimes on kerosene heaters and stoves.

The first widespread introduction of catalytic converters was in the United States automobile market. To comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s stricter regulation of exhaust emissions, most gasoline-powered vehicles starting with the 1975 model year are equipped with catalytic converters. These &quot;two-way&quot; converters combine oxygen with carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). 

Although two-way converters on gasoline engines were rendered obsolete in 1981 by &quot;three-way&quot; converters that also reduce oxides of nitrogen (), they are still used on lean-burn engines to oxidize particulate matter and hydrocarbon emissions (including diesel engines, which typically use lean combustion), as three-way-converters require fuel-rich or stoichiometric combustion to successfully reduce .

Although catalytic converters are most commonly applied to exhaust systems in automobiles, they are also used on electrical generators, forklifts, mining equipment, trucks, buses, locomotives, motorcycles, and on ships. They are even used on some wood stoves to control emissions. This is usually in response to government regulation, either through environmental regulation or through health and safety regulations.

==History==
Catalytic converter prototypes were first designed in France at the end of the 19th century, when only a few thousand &quot;oil cars&quot; were on the roads; these prototypes had inert clay-based materials coated with platinum, rhodium, and palladium and sealed into a double metallic cylinder. A few decades later, a catalytic converter was patented by Eugene Houdry, a French mechanical engineer. Houdry was an expert in catalytic oil refining, having invented the catalytic cracking process that all modern refining is based on today. Houdry moved to the United States in 1930 to live near the refineries in Philadelphia and develop his catalytic refining process. 

When the results of early studies of smog in Los Angeles were published, Houdry became concerned about the role of smokestack exhaust and automobile exhaust in air pollution and founded a company called Oxy-Catalyst. Houdry first developed catalytic converters for smokestacks, called &quot;cats&quot; for short, and later developed catalytic converters for warehouse forklifts that used low grade, unleaded gasoline. In the mid-1950s, he began research to develop catalytic converters for gasoline engines used on cars and was awarded United States Patent 2,742,437 for his work.

Catalytic converters were further developed by a series of engineers including Carl D. Keith, John J. Mooney, Antonio Eleazar, and Phillip Messina at Engelhard Corporation, creating the first production catalytic converter in 1973.

The first widespread introduction of catalytic converters was in the United States automobile market. To comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s new exhaust emissions regulations, most gasoline-powered vehicles manufactured from 1975 onwards are equipped with catalytic converters. Early catalytic converters were &quot;two-way&quot;, combining oxygen with carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC, chemical compounds in fuel of the form CmHn) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). These stringent emission control regulations also resulted in the removal of the antiknock agent tetraethyl lead from automotive gasoline, to reduce lead in the air. Lead and its compounds are catalyst poisons and foul catalytic converters by coating the catalyst&#x27;s surface. Requiring the removal of lead allowed the use of catalytic converters to meet the other emission standards in the regulations. 

To lower harmful emissions, a twin-catalyst system was developed in the 1970s this added a separate (rhodium/platinum) catalyst which reduced ahead of the air pump, after which a two-way catalytic converter (palladium/platinum) removed HC and CO. This cumbersome and expensive system was soon made redundant, after it was noted that under some conditions the initial catalyst also removed HC and CO. This led to the development of the three-way catalyst, made possible by electronics and engine management developments.

William C. Pfefferle developed a catalytic combustor for gas turbines in the early 1970s, allowing combustion without significant formation of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide. Four-way catalytic converters have also been developed which also remove particulates from engine exhaust; since most of these particulates are unburned hydrocarbons, they can be burned to convert them into carbon dioxide.

==Construction==

The catalytic converter&#x27;s construction is as follows:

# The catalyst support or substrate. For automotive catalytic converters, the core is usually a ceramic monolith that has a honeycomb structure (commonly square, not hexagonal). (Prior to the mid 1980s, the catalyst material was deposited on a packed bed of alumina pellets in early GM applications.) Metallic foil monoliths made of Kanthal (FeCrAl) are used in applications where particularly high heat resistance is required. The substrate is structured to produce a large surface area. The cordierite ceramic substrate used in most catalytic converters was invented by Rodney Bagley, Irwin Lachman, and Ronald Lewis at Corning Glass, for which they were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2002.
# The washcoat. A washcoat is a carrier for the catalytic materials and is used to disperse the materials over a large surface area. Aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, silicon dioxide e.g. colloidal silica or a mixture of silica and alumina can be used. The catalytic materials are suspended in the washcoat prior to applying to the core. Washcoat materials are selected to form a rough, irregular surface, which increases the surface area compared to the smooth surface of the bare substrate.
# Ceria or ceria-zirconia. These oxides are mainly added as oxygen storage promoters.
# The catalyst itself is most often a mix of precious metals, mostly from the platinum group. Platinum is the most active catalyst and is widely used, but is not suitable for all applications because of unwanted additional reactions and historically high cost. Palladium and rhodium are two other precious metals used, though as of February 2023, platinum has become the least expensive of the platinum group metals. Rhodium is used as a reduction catalyst, palladium is used as an oxidation catalyst, and platinum is used both for reduction and oxidation. Cerium, iron, manganese, and nickel are also used, although each has limitations. Nickel is not legal for use in the European Union because of its reaction with carbon monoxide into toxic nickel tetracarbonyl. Copper can be used in most countries, with a notable exception in Japan.

Upon failure, a catalytic converter can be recycled into scrap. The precious metals inside the converter, including platinum, palladium, and rhodium, are extracted.

==Placement of catalytic converters==
Catalytic converters require a temperature of to operate effectively. Therefore, they are placed as close to the engine as possible, or one or more smaller catalytic converters (known as &quot;pre-cats&quot;) are placed immediately after the exhaust manifold.

==Types==
=== Two-way===
A 2-way (or &quot;oxidation&quot;, sometimes called an &quot;oxi-cat&quot;) catalytic converter has two simultaneous tasks:
# Oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide: 
# Oxidation of hydrocarbons (unburnt and partially burned fuel) to carbon dioxide and water: (a combustion reaction)

The two-way catalytic converter is widely used on diesel engines to reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. They were also used on gasoline engines in American and Canadian automobile markets until 1981. Because of their inability to control oxides of nitrogen, manufacturers briefly installed twin catalyst systems, with an reducing, rhodium/platinum catalyst ahead of the air pump, which led to the development of the three-way catalytic converter. The two-way catalytic converter also continued to be used on certain, lower-cost cars in some markets such as Europe, where emissions were not universally regulated until the introduction of the Euro 3 emissions standard in 2000.

=== Three-way===
The three-way catalytic converters have the additional advantage of controlling the emission of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (both together abbreviated with  and not to be confused with nitrous oxide (N2O)).  are precursors to acid rain and smog.

Since 1981, the three-way (oxidation-reduction) catalytic converters have been used in vehicle emission control systems in the United States and Canada; many other countries have also adopted stringent vehicle emission regulations that in effect require three-way converters on gasoline-powered vehicles. The reduction and oxidation catalysts are typically contained in a common housing; however, in some instances, they may be housed separately. A three-way catalytic converter does three simultaneous tasks:

&quot;Reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen (N2)&quot;
* formula_1
* formula_2
* formula_3
* formula_4
&quot;Oxidation of carbon, hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide&quot;
* formula_5
* formula_6
* formula_7
These three reactions occur most efficiently when the catalytic converter receives exhaust from an engine running slightly above the stoichiometric point. For gasoline combustion, this ratio is between 14.6 and 14.8 parts air to one part fuel, by weight. The ratio for autogas (or liquefied petroleum gas LPG), natural gas, and ethanol fuels can vary significantly for each, notably so with oxygenated or alcohol based fuels, with E85 requiring approximately 34% more fuel, requiring modified fuel system tuning and components when using those fuels. Engines fitted with regulated 3-way catalytic converters are equipped with a computerized closed-loop feedback fuel injection system using one or more oxygen sensors (also known as Lambda Sonds or sensors). Other variants combined three-way converters with carburetors equipped with feedback mixture control were used. An unregulated three-way converter features the same chemical processes but without the oxygen sensor, which meant higher emissions, particularly under partial loads. These were low-cost solutions, typically used for retrofitting to older cars or for smaller, cheaper cars.

Three-way converters are effective when the engine is operated within a narrow band of airfuel ratios near the stoichiometric point. Total conversion efficiency falls very rapidly when the engine is operated outside of this band. Slightly lean of stoichiometric, the exhaust gases from the engine contain excess oxygen, the production of by the engine increases, and the efficiency of the catalyst at reducing falls off rapidly. However, the conversion of HC and CO is very efficient due to the available oxygen, oxidizing to H2O and CO2. Slightly rich of stoichiometric, the production of CO and unburnt HC by the engine starts to increase dramatically, available oxygen decreases, and the efficiency of the catalyst for oxidizing CO and HC decreases significantly, especially as stored oxygen becomes depleted. However, the efficiency of the catalyst at reducing is good, and the production of by the engine decreases. To maintain catalyst efficiency, the airfuel ratio must stay close to stoichiometric and not remain rich or lean for too long.

Closed-loop engine control systems are used for effective operation of three-way catalytic converters because of this continuous rich-lean balance required for effective reduction and HC+CO oxidation. The control system allows the catalyst to release oxygen during slightly rich operating conditions, which oxidizes CO and HC under conditions that also favor the reduction of NOx. Before the stored oxygen is depleted, the control system shifts the airfuel ratio to become slightly lean, improving HC and CO oxidation while storing additional oxygen in the catalyst material, at a small penalty in reduction efficiency. Then the airfuel mixture is brought back to slightly rich, at a small penalty in CO and HC oxidation efficiency, and the cycle repeats. Efficiency is improved when this oscillation around the stoichiometric point is small and carefully controlled.

Closed-loop control under light to moderate load is accomplished by using one or more oxygen sensors in the exhaust system. When oxygen is detected by the sensor, the airfuel ratio is lean of stoichiometric, and when oxygen is not detected, it is rich. The control system adjusts the rate of fuel being injected into the engine based on this signal to keep the airfuel ratio near the stoichiometric point in order to maximize the catalyst conversion efficiency. The control algorithm is also affected by the time delay between the adjustment of the fuel flow rate and the sensing of the changed airfuel ratio by the sensor, as well as the sigmoidal response of the oxygen sensors. Typical control systems are designed to rapidly sweep the airfuel ratio such that it oscillates slightly around the stoichiometric point, staying near the optimal efficiency point while managing the levels of stored oxygen and unburnt HC.

Closed loop control is often not used during high load/maximum power operation, when an increase in emissions is permitted and a rich mixture is commanded to increase power and prevent exhaust gas temperature from exceeding design limits. This presents a challenge for control system and catalyst design. During such operations, large amounts of unburnt HC are produced by the engine, well beyond the capacity of the catalyst to release oxygen. The surface of the catalyst quickly becomes saturated with HC. When returning to lower power output and leaner airfuel ratios, the control system must prevent excessive oxygen from reaching the catalyst too quickly, as this will rapidly burn the HC in the already hot catalyst, potentially exceeding the design temperature limit of the catalyst. Excessive catalyst temperature can prematurely age the catalyst, reducing its efficiency before reaching its design lifetime. Excessive catalyst temperature can also be caused by cylinder misfire, which continuously flows unburnt HC combined with oxygen to the hot catalyst, burning in the catalyst and increasing its temperature.

====Unwanted reactions====
Unwanted reactions result in the formation of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which poison catalysts. Nickel or manganese is sometimes added to the washcoat to limit hydrogen-sulfide emissions. Sulfur-free or low-sulfur fuels eliminate or minimize problems with hydrogen sulfide.

===Diesel engines===
For compression-ignition (i.e., diesel) engines, the most commonly used catalytic converter is the &quot;diesel oxidation catalyst&quot; (DOC). DOCs contain palladium or platinum supported on alumina. This catalyst converts particulate matter (PM), hydrocarbons, and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and water. These converters often operate at 90 percent efficiency, virtually eliminating diesel odor and helping reduce visible particulates. These catalysts are ineffective for , so emissions from diesel engines are controlled by exhaust gas recirculation (EGR).

In 2010, most light-duty diesel manufacturers in the U.S. added catalytic systems to their vehicles to meet federal emissions requirements. Two techniques have been developed for the catalytic reduction of emissions under lean exhaust conditions, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and the adsorber.

Instead of precious metal-containing absorbers, most manufacturers selected base-metal SCR systems that use a reagent such as ammonia to reduce the into nitrogen and water. Ammonia is supplied to the catalyst system by the injection of urea into the exhaust, which then undergoes thermal decomposition and hydrolysis into ammonia. The urea solution is also referred to as diesel exhaust fluid (DEF).

Diesel exhaust contains relatively high levels of particulate matter. Catalytic converters remove only 20–40% of PM so particulates are cleaned up by a soot trap or diesel particulate filter (DPF). In the U.S., all on-road light, medium, and heavy-duty diesel-powered vehicles built after 1 January 2007, are subject to diesel particulate emission limits, and so are equipped with a 2-way catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter. As long as the engine was manufactured before 1 January 2007, the vehicle is not required to have the DPF system. This led to an inventory runup by engine manufacturers in late 2006 so they could continue selling pre-DPF vehicles well into 2007.

===Lean-burn spark-ignition engines===
For lean-burn spark-ignition engines, an oxidation catalyst is used in the same manner as in a diesel engine. Emissions from lean burn spark ignition engines are very similar to emissions from a diesel compression ignition engine.

==Installation==
Many vehicles have a close-coupled catalytic converter located near the engine&#x27;s exhaust manifold. The converter heats up quickly, due to its exposure to the very hot exhaust gases, allowing it to reduce undesirable emissions during the engine warm-up period. This is achieved by burning off the excess hydrocarbons which result from the extra-rich mixture required for a cold start.

When catalytic converters were first introduced, most vehicles used carburetors that provided a relatively rich air-fuel ratio. Oxygen (O2) levels in the exhaust stream were therefore generally insufficient for the catalytic reaction to occur efficiently. Most designs of the time therefore included secondary air injection, which injected air into the exhaust stream. This increased the available oxygen, allowing the catalyst to function as intended.

Some three-way catalytic converter systems have air injection systems with the air injected between the first ( reduction) and second (HC and CO oxidation) stages of the converter. As in two-way converters, this injected air provides oxygen for the oxidation reactions. An upstream air injection point, ahead of the catalytic converter, is also sometimes present to provide additional oxygen only during the engine warm up period. This causes unburned fuel to ignite in the exhaust tract, thereby preventing it reaching the catalytic converter at all. This technique reduces the engine runtime needed for the catalytic converter to reach its &quot;light-off&quot; or operating temperature.

Most newer vehicles have electronic fuel injection systems, and do not require air injection systems in their exhausts. Instead, they provide a precisely controlled air-fuel mixture that quickly and continually cycles between lean and rich combustion. Oxygen sensors monitor the exhaust oxygen content before and after the catalytic converter, and the engine control unit uses this information to adjust the fuel injection so as to prevent the first ( reduction) catalyst from becoming oxygen-loaded, while simultaneously ensuring the second (HC and CO oxidation) catalyst is sufficiently oxygen-saturated.

==Damage==
Catalyst poisoning occurs when the catalytic converter is exposed to exhaust containing substances that coat the working surfaces, so that they cannot contact and react with the exhaust. The most notable contaminant is lead, so vehicles equipped with catalytic converters can run only on unleaded fuel. Other common catalyst poisons include sulfur, manganese (originating primarily from the gasoline additive MMT), and silicon, which can enter the exhaust stream if the engine has a leak that allows coolant into the combustion chamber. Phosphorus is another catalyst contaminant. Although phosphorus is no longer used in gasoline, it (and zinc, another low-level catalyst contaminant) was widely used in engine oil antiwear additives such as zinc dithiophosphate (ZDDP). Beginning in 2004, a limit of phosphorus concentration in engine oils was adopted in the API SM and ILSAC GF-4 specifications.

Depending on the contaminant, catalyst poisoning can sometimes be reversed by running the engine under a very heavy load for an extended period of time. The increased exhaust temperature can sometimes vaporize or sublimate the contaminant, removing it from the catalytic surface. However, removal of lead deposits in this manner is usually not possible because of lead&#x27;s high boiling point.

Any condition that causes abnormally high levels of unburned hydrocarbons (raw or partially burnt fuel or oils) to reach the converter will tend to significantly elevate its temperature bringing the risk of a meltdown of the substrate and resultant catalytic deactivation and severe exhaust restriction. These conditions include failure of the upstream components of the exhaust system (manifold or header assembly and associated clamps susceptible to rust, corrosion or fatigue such as the exhaust manifold splintering after repeated heat cycling), ignition system (e.g., coil packs, primary ignition components, distributor cap, wires, ignition coil and spark plugs) or damaged fuel system components (e.g., fuel injectors, fuel pressure regulator, and associated sensors). Oil and coolant leaks, perhaps caused by a head gasket leak, can also cause high unburned hydrocarbons.

==Regulations==

Emissions regulations vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Most automobile spark-ignition engines in North America have been fitted with catalytic converters since 1975, and the technology used in non-automotive applications is generally based on automotive technology. In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to remove or disable a catalytic converter for any reason other than its direct and immediate replacement. Nevertheless, some vehicle owners remove or &quot;gut&quot; the catalytic converter on their vehicle. In such cases, the converter may be replaced by a welded-in section of ordinary pipe or a flanged &quot;test pipe&quot;, ostensibly meant to check if the converter is clogged by comparing how the engine runs with and without the converter. This facilitates temporary reinstallation of the converter in order to pass an emission test.

In the United States, it is a violation of Section 203(a)(3)(A) of the 1990 amended Clean Air Act for a vehicle repair shop to remove a converter from a vehicle, or cause a converter to be removed from a vehicle, except in order to replace it with another converter, and Section 203(a)(3)(B) makes it illegal for any person to sell or to install any part that would bypass, defeat, or render inoperative any emission control system, device, or design element. Vehicles without functioning catalytic converters generally fail emission inspections. The automotive aftermarket supplies high-flow converters for vehicles with upgraded engines, or whose owners prefer an exhaust system with larger-than-stock capacity.

Catalytic converters have been mandatory on all new gasoline cars sold in the European Union and the United Kingdom since January 1, 1993 in order to comply with the Euro 1 emission standards.

==Effect on exhaust flow==
Faulty catalytic converters as well as undamaged early types of converters can restrict the flow of exhaust, which negatively affects vehicle performance and fuel economy. Modern catalytic converters do not significantly restrict exhaust flow. A 2006 test on a 1999 Honda Civic, for example, showed that removing the stock catalytic converter netted only a 3% increase in maximum horsepower; a new metallic core converter only cost the car 1% horsepower, compared to no converter.

==Dangers==
Carburetors on pre-1981 vehicles without feedback fuel-air mixture control could easily provide too much fuel to the engine, which could cause the catalytic converter to overheat and potentially ignite flammable materials under the car.

===Warm-up period===
Vehicles fitted with catalytic converters emit most of their total pollution during the first five minutes of engine operation; that is, before the catalytic converter has warmed up sufficiently to be fully effective.

In the early 2000s it became common to place the catalyst converter right next to the exhaust manifold, close to the engine, for much quicker warm-up.
In 1995, Alpina introduced an electrically heated catalyst. Called &quot;E-KAT&quot;, it was used in Alpina&#x27;s B12 5,7 E-KAT based on the BMW 750i. Heating coils inside the catalytic converter assemblies are electrified just after the engine is started, bringing the catalyst up to operating temperature very quickly to qualify the vehicle for low emission vehicle (LEV) designation. BMW later introduced the same heated catalyst, developed jointly by Emitec, Alpina, and BMW, in its 750i in 1999.

Some vehicles contain a pre-cat, a small catalytic converter upstream of the main catalytic converter which heats up faster on vehicle start up, reducing the emissions associated with cold starts. A pre-cat is most commonly used by an auto manufacturer when trying to attain the Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) rating, such as on the Toyota MR2 Roadster.

===Environmental effect===
Catalytic converters have proven to be reliable and effective in reducing noxious tailpipe emissions. However, they also have some shortcomings in use, and also adverse environmental effects in production:
* An engine equipped with a three-way catalyst must run at the stoichiometric point, which means more fuel is consumed than in a lean-burn engine. This means approximately 10% more CO2 emissions from the vehicle.
* Catalytic converter production requires palladium or platinum; part of the world supply of these precious metals is produced near Norilsk, Russia, where the industry (among others) has caused Norilsk to be added to &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of most-polluted places.
* The extreme heat of the converters themselves can cause wildfires, especially in dry areas.

==Theft==

Because of the external location and the use of valuable precious metals including platinum, palladium and rhodium, catalytic converters are a target for thieves. The problem is especially common among late-model pickup trucks and truck-based SUVs, because of their high ground clearance and easily removed bolt-on catalytic converters. Welded-on converters are also at risk of theft, as they can be easily cut off. The Toyota Prius catalytic converters are also targets for thieves. The catalytic converters of hybrids need more of the precious metals to work properly compared to conventional internal combustion vehicles because they do not get as hot as those installed on conventional vehicles, since the combustion engines of hybrids only run part of the time.

Pipecutters are often used to quietly remove the converter but other tools such as a portable reciprocating saw can damage other components of the car, such as the alternator, wiring or fuel lines, with potentially dangerous consequences.

In 2023, bipartisan legislation to combat catalytic converter theft was introduced in the U.S. Senate. The Preventing Auto Recycling Thefts Act (PART Act) would mandate catalytic converters in new vehicles to come with traceable identification numbers. Additionally, the legislation would make catalytic converter theft a federal criminal offense.

=== Statistics ===
Rising metal prices in the U.S. during the 2000s commodities boom led to a significant increase in converter theft. A catalytic converter can cost more than $1,000 to replace, more if the vehicle is damaged during the theft. Apart from damaging other systems of the vehicle, theft can also cause death and injury to thieves.

Thefts of catalytic converters rose over tenfold in the United States from the late 2010s to early 2020s, driven presumably by the rise in the price of precious metals contained within the converters. Study findings reveal an average price elasticity of 1.98, which means that a 10 percent increase in the price of metal leads to an approximate 20 percent increase in thefts. According to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, there were 1,298 reported cases of catalytic converter theft in 2018, which increased to 14,433 in 2020. In 2022, it was reported that the number of catalytic converter thefts in the United States sharply rose to 153,000 total thefts for the year.

From 2019 to 2020, thieves in the United Kingdom were targeting older-model hybrid cars (such as Toyota&#x27;s hybrids) which have more precious metals than newer vehicles—sometimes worth more than the value of the car—leading to scarcity and long delays in replacing them.

In 2021 a trend emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where catalytic converters were alleged to be stolen for use in illicit street drug production. The drug, a powder known as &quot;bombé,&quot; was said to be a mixture of powdered pills/vitamins and pulverized honeycomb structures of catalytic converters. In 2023, however, a study of various samples of the drug concluded that its alleged origin from catalytic exhausts was found to be unsubstantiated.

==Diagnostics==
Various jurisdictions now require on-board diagnostics to monitor the function and condition of the emissions-control system, including the catalytic converter. Vehicles equipped with OBD-II diagnostic systems are designed to alert the driver to a misfire condition by means of illuminating the &quot;check engine&quot; light on the dashboard, or flashing it if the current misfire conditions are severe enough to potentially damage the catalytic converter. On-board diagnostic systems take several forms.

Temperature sensors are used for two purposes. The first is as a warning system, typically on two-way catalytic converters such as those used on LPG forklifts. The function of the sensor is to warn of catalytic converter temperature above the safe limit of . Modern catalytic-converter designs are not as susceptible to temperature damage and can withstand sustained temperatures of . Temperature sensors are also used to monitor catalyst functioning: usually two sensors will be fitted, with one before the catalyst and one after to monitor the temperature rise over the catalytic-converter core.

The oxygen sensor is the basis of the closed-loop control system on a spark-ignited rich-burn engine; however, it is also used for diagnostics. In vehicles with OBD II, a second oxygen sensor is fitted after the catalytic converter to monitor the O2 levels. The O2 levels are monitored to see the efficiency of the burn process. The on-board computer makes comparisons between the readings of the two sensors. The readings are taken by voltage measurements. If both sensors show the same output or the rear O2 is &quot;switching&quot;, the computer recognizes that the catalytic converter either is not functioning or has been removed, and will operate a malfunction indicator lamp and affect engine performance. Simple &quot;oxygen sensor simulators&quot; have been developed to circumvent this problem by simulating the change across the catalytic converter with plans and pre-assembled devices available on the Internet. Although these are not legal for on-road use, they have been used with mixed results. Similar devices apply an offset to the sensor signals, allowing the engine to run a more fuel-economical lean burn that may, however, damage the engine or the catalytic converter.

sensors are extremely expensive and are in general used only when a compression-ignition engine is fitted with a selective catalytic-reduction (SCR) converter, or a absorber in a feedback system. When fitted to an SCR system, there may be one or two sensors. When one sensor is fitted it will be pre-catalyst; when two are fitted, the second one will be post-catalyst. They are used for the same reasons and in the same manner as an oxygen sensor; the only difference is the substance being monitored.
