<text>The Kuril Islands dispute, known as the Northern Territories dispute in Japan, is a territorial dispute between Japan and Russia over the ownership of the four southernmost Kuril Islands. The Kuril Islands are a chain of islands that stretch between the Japanese island of Hokkaido at their southern end and the Russian Kamchatka Peninsula at their northern end. The islands separate the Sea of Okhotsk from the Pacific Ocean. The four disputed islands, like other islands in the Kuril chain which are not in dispute, were unilaterally annexed by the Soviet Union following the Kuril Islands landing operation at the end of World War II. The disputed islands are under Russian administration as the South Kuril District and part of the Kuril District of the Sakhalin Oblast (Сахалинская область, &quot;Sakhalinskaya oblast&quot;). They are claimed by Japan, which refers to them as its Northern Territories or Southern Chishima, and considers them part of the Nemuro Subprefecture of Hokkaido Prefecture.

The islands in dispute are:

* Iturup ()—Etorofu Island (Japanese: )
* Kunashir ()—Kunashiri Island (Japanese: )
* Shikotan ()—Shikotan Island (Japanese: )
* Habomai Islands ( )—Habomai Islands (Japanese: )

The San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed between the Allies and Japan in 1951, states that Japan renounces &quot;all right, title and claim to the Kuril Islands&quot;, but does not explicitly recognize the Soviet Union&#x27;s sovereignty over them. Japan claims that at least some of the disputed islands are not a part of the Kuril Islands, and thus are not covered by the treaty. Russia maintains that the Soviet Union&#x27;s sovereignty over the islands was recognized in post-war agreements. Japan and the Soviet Union ended their formal state of war with the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956 but did not sign a peace treaty. During talks leading to the joint declaration, the Soviet Union offered Japan the two smaller islands of Shikotan and the Habomai Islands in exchange for Japan renouncing all claims to the two bigger islands of Iturup and Kunashir, but Japan declined the offer. This disagreement between the two-island offer made by the Soviet Union and Japan&#x27;s demand of regaining two bigger islands as well became the cornerstone for continuation of the dispute into the present day.
==Background==


The first Russo-Japanese agreement to deal with the status of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands was the 1855 Treaty of Shimoda, which first established official relations between the Russian Empire and Tokugawa Japan. Article 2 of the Treaty of Shimoda, which provided for an agreement on borders, states &quot;Henceforth the borders between Russia and Japan will pass between the islands Iturup (Etorofu) and Urup (Uruppu). The whole island of Iturup belongs to Japan and the whole island Urup and the other Kuril Islands to the north constitute possessions of Russia&quot;. The islands of Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai Islands, all lying to the south of Iturup, are not explicitly mentioned in the treaty and were understood at the time to be a non-disputed part of Japan. The treaty also specified that the island of Sakhalin/Karafuto was not to be partitioned but was to remain under a joint Russo-Japanese condominium.

In the 1875 Treaty of Saint Petersburg, Russia and Japan agreed that Japan would give up all rights to Sakhalin in exchange for Russia giving up all rights to the Kuril Islands in favor of Japan. However, a controversy remains as to what constitutes the Kuril Islands, due to translation discrepancies in the French official text of that treaty.

The Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 was a military disaster for Russia. The 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth, concluded at the end of this war, gave the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan.

Although Japan occupied parts of Russia&#x27;s Far East during the Russian Civil War following the October Revolution, Japan did not formally annex any of these territories and they were depopulated by Japan by the mid-1920s.

Japan was a main ally of Nazi Germany, which the Soviet Union initially had an understanding with, but found itself at war with from June 22, 1941. However, after the Battles of Khalkhin Gol ended the Japanese–Soviet Border War in 1939 and before the Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945, there was practically no hostile activity between the Soviet Union and the Empire of Japan. Between 1939 and 1945, millions of Soviet and Japanese soldiers were facing each other along the Manchurian border. The Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact was signed in Moscow on April 13, 1941, and became effective on April 25, but was renounced by the Soviet Union on April 5, 1945. On May 8 Nazi Germany surrendered to the Western allies, on May 9 to the Soviet Union, which ended the war in Europe and started the secret three-month countdown for the Russians to start hostilities against Japan, as per the Yalta Agreement. On August 9, 1945, just after midnight in Manchuria, the Soviets invaded Manchuria and the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, beginning the Soviet–Japanese War. The Soviet Union invaded South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in the subsequent days.

The Invasion of the Kuril Islands took place between August 18 and September 3 (Japan had announced its surrender August 15, and formally signed it September 2). The Japanese inhabitants of the Kurils were expelled two years later. The United States had helped the preparation of the Soviet invasion through Project Hula, transferring naval vessels to the Soviet Union.

==Modern dispute==
===World War II agreements===
The modern Kuril Islands dispute arose in the aftermath of World War II and results from the ambiguities in and disagreements about the meaning of the Yalta agreement (February 1945), the Potsdam Declaration (July 1945), and the Treaty of San Francisco (September 1951). The Yalta Agreement, signed by the US, Great Britain and the Soviet Union, stated:

The leaders of the three great powers – the Soviet Union, the United States of America and Great Britain – have agreed that in two or three months after Germany has surrendered and the war in Europe is terminated, the Soviet Union shall enter into war against Japan on the side of the Allies on condition that: ... 2. The former rights of Russia violated by the treacherous attack of Japan in 1904 shall be restored, viz.: (a) The southern part of Sakhalin as well as the islands adjacent to it shall be returned to the Soviet Union; ... 3. The Kuril islands shall be handed over to the Soviet Union.

Japan and the US claimed that the Yalta agreement did not apply to the Northern Territories because they were not a part of the Kuril Islands, although US geographers have traditionally listed them as part of the Kuril chain. In a 1998 article in the journal &quot;Pacific Affairs&quot;, Bruce Elleman, Michael Nichols and Matthew Ouimet argue that the US never accepted the cession of all the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union and has maintained from Yalta onward that it simply agreed at Yalta that Moscow could negotiate directly with Tokyo to come to a mutually acceptable solution, and that the US would support in such a peace agreement the Soviet acquisition of the Kurils. As a key piece of evidence, the same article quotes an August 27, 1945, letter from U.S. President Harry Truman to Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin: &quot;You evidently misunderstood my message [about the Kuril Islands] ... I was not speaking of any territory of the Soviet Republic. I was speaking of the Kurile Islands, Japanese territory, disposition of which must be made at a peace settlement. I was advised that my predecessor agreed to support in the peace settlement the Soviet acquisition of those islands.&quot; The Soviet Union—and subsequently, Russia—rejected this position.

The Potsdam Declaration states the following regarding the Japanese territories: &quot;8. The terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out and Japanese sovereignty shall be limited to the islands of Honshū, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine&quot;. The islands comprising the Northern Territories are not explicitly included in this list, but the US subsequently maintained, particularly during the preparation of the Treaty of San Francisco, that the phrase &quot;and such minor islands as we determine&quot; could be used to justify transferring the Northern Territories to Japan.

The Cairo Declaration of 1943 did not explicitly mention the Kuril Islands but stated: &quot;Japan will also be expelled from all other territories which she has taken by violence and greed&quot;.

Japan later claimed that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration did not apply to the islands on the grounds that they had never belonged to Russia or been claimed by it since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1855, and thus they were not among the territories acquired by Japan &quot;by violence and greed&quot;.

===San Francisco Treaty===
A substantial dispute regarding the status of the Kuril Islands arose between the U.S. and the Soviet Union during the preparation of the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951. The Treaty was supposed to be a permanent peace treaty between Japan and the Allied Powers of World War II. By that time, the Cold War had already taken hold, and the position of the U.S. in relation to the Yalta and Potsdam agreements had changed considerably. The U.S. had come to maintain that the Potsdam Declaration should take precedence and that strict adherence to the Yalta agreement was not necessary since, in the view of the U.S., the Soviet Union itself violated several provisions of the Yalta agreement in relation to the rights of other countries. The Soviet Union vehemently disagreed and demanded that the U.S. adhere to its promises made to the Soviet Union in Yalta as a condition of the Soviet Union&#x27;s entry into the war with Japan. A particular point of disagreement at the time was the fact that the draft text of the treaty, while stating that Japan will renounce all rights to Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, did not state explicitly that Japan would recognize the Soviet Union&#x27;s sovereignty over these territories.

The Treaty of San Francisco was signed by 49 nations, including Japan and the United States, on September 8, 1951. Article (2c) states:

Japan renounces all right, title and claim to the Kurile Islands, and to that portion of Sakhalin and the islands adjacent to it over which Japan acquired sovereignty as a consequence of the Treaty of Portsmouth of 5 September 1905.

The State Department later clarified that &quot;the Habomai Islands and Shikotan ... are properly part of Hokkaido and that Japan is entitled to sovereignty over them&quot;. Britain and the United States agreed that territorial rights would not be granted to nations that did not sign the Treaty of San Francisco, and therefore the islands were not formally recognized as Soviet territory.

The Soviet Union refused to sign the Treaty of San Francisco and publicly stated that the Kuril Islands issue was one of the reasons for its opposition to the Treaty. Japan signed and ratified the San Francisco treaty. However, both the Japanese government and most of the Japanese media currently claim that already at the time of the 1951 San Francisco peace conference, Japan held that the islands of Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai Islands were technically not a part of the Kuril Islands and thus were not covered by the provisions of Article (2c) of the treaty. The timing of this claim is disputed by Russia and by some western historians. In a 2005 article in &quot;The Japan Times&quot;, journalist Gregory Clark writes that official Japanese statements, maps and other documents from 1951, and the statements by the head of the U.S. delegation to the San Francisco conference—John Foster Dulles—make it clear that at the time the San Francisco Treaty was concluded in October 1951, both Japan and the United States considered the islands of Kunashiri and Etorofu to be a part of the Kuril Islands and to be covered by Article (2c) of the Treaty. Clark made a similar point in a 1992 &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion column.

In a 2001 book, Seokwoo Lee, a Korean scholar of international law, quotes the October 19, 1951, statement in Japan&#x27;s Diet by Kumao Nishimura, Director of the Treaties Bureau of the Foreign Ministry of Japan, stating that both Etorofu and Kunashiri are a part of the Kuril Islands and thus covered by Article (2c) of the San Francisco Treaty.

The U.S. Senate Resolution of April 28, 1952, ratifying of the San Francisco Treaty, explicitly stated that the Soviet Union had no title to the Kurils, the resolution stating:

As part of such advice and consent the Senate states that nothing the treaty [San Francisco Peace Treaty] contains is deemed to diminish or prejudice, in favor of the Soviet Union, the right, title, and interest of Japan, or the Allied Powers as defined in said treaty, in and to South Sakhalin and its adjacent islands, the Kurile Islands, the Habomai Islands, the Island of Shikotan, or any other territory, rights, or interests possessed by Japan on December 7, 1941, or to confer any right, title, or benefit therein or thereto on the Soviet Union.

The U.S. maintains that until a peace treaty between Japan and Russia is concluded, the disputed Northern Territories remain occupied territory under Russian control via General Order No. 1. According to the Russian Embassy in Japan, &quot;A peace treaty has not yet been concluded between the two countries, due to Tokyo&#x27;s groundless territorial claims to the southern Kuril Islands.&quot;

===1956 Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration===
During the 1956 peace talks between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Soviet side proposed to settle the dispute by returning Shikotan and Habomai to Japan. In the final round of the talks, the Japanese side accepted the weakness of its claim to Iturup and Kunashiri and agreed to settle on the return of Shikotan and the Habomai Islands, in exchange for a peace treaty. On October 19, 1956, in Moscow, the Soviet Union and Japan signed the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration. The Declaration ended the state of war between the Soviet Union and Japan, which technically had still existed between the two countries since August 1945, and stipulated that &quot;The U.S.S.R. and Japan have agreed to continue, after the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between them, negotiations for the conclusion of a peace treaty. Hereby, the U.S.S.R., in response to the desires of Japan and taking into consideration the interest of the Japanese state, agrees to hand over to Japan the Habomai and the Shikotan Islands, provided that the actual changing over to Japan of these islands will be carried out after the conclusion of a peace treaty.&quot;

The Joint Declaration did not settle the Kuril Islands dispute, however. In particular, the disagreement emerged over the interpretation of the territorial provisions of the Declaration, despite the Soviet efforts to avoid precisely that. The Soviet position was that the Declaration resolved the dispute and that no territorial demarcation will be discussed beyond promised transfer of Shikotan and Habomai, whilst Japan maintains that negotiations for conclusion of a peace treaty necessarily imply continuation of negotiations over the two larger islands as well.

Continuation of the deadlock is often attributed to the United States&#x27; intervention in the negotiations, when the US warned Japan that a withdrawal of the Japanese claim on the other islands would mean the U.S. would keep both Okinawa and the Ryukyu Islands, while asserting that the San Francisco Peace Treaty &quot;did not determine the sovereignty of the territories renounced by Japan&quot;, but that &quot;Japan does not have the right to transfer sovereignty over such territories&quot;, although this attribution is problematic, since the decision to stand firm on demanding &quot;four island return&quot; (rather than following initial &quot;minimal requirement&quot; line of demanding only Shikotan and Habomai) was made by Japan long before the United States&#x27; decision to &quot;morally support&quot; these claims.

====Dispute over the composition of the Kuril Islands====
The question of whether Etorofu and Kunashiri islands are a part of the Kurils, and thus whether they are covered by Article (2c) of the Treaty of San Francisco, remains one of the main outstanding issues in the Kuril Islands dispute. Based on a 1966 book by a former Japanese diplomat and a member of the 1956 Japanese delegation for the Moscow peace talks, Clark traces the first Japanese claim that Etorofu and Kunashiri islands are not a part of the Kurils to the 1956 negotiations on the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956. The Soviet Union rejected that view at the time, and Russia has subsequently maintained the same position.

===21st-century developments===
The positions of the two sides have not substantially changed since the 1956 Joint Declaration, and a permanent peace treaty between Japan and Russia has not been concluded.

On July 7, 2005, the European Parliament issued an official statement recommending the return of the territories in dispute, which Russia immediately protested.

As late as 2006, the Russian government of Vladimir Putin offered Japan the return of Shikotan and the Habomais (about 6% of the disputed area) if Japan would renounce its claims to the other two islands, referring to the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which promised Shikotan and the Habomais would be ceded to Japan once a peace treaty was signed.

Japan has offered substantial financial aid to the Kuril Islands if they are handed over. However, by 2007, residents of the islands were starting to benefit from economic growth and improved living standards, arising in particular from expansion in the fish processing industry. As a result, it is thought that islanders are less likely to be won over by Japanese offers of financial support.

On February 7, 2008, Reuters reported that Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda stated that he had received a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin in which Putin expressed a willingness to resolve the territorial dispute, and proposed a new round of talks to do so.

The dispute over the Kuril Islands was exacerbated on July 16, 2008, when the Japanese government published new school textbook guidelines directing teachers to say that Japan has sovereignty over the Southern Kuril Islands. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on July 18, &quot;[these actions] contribute neither to the development of positive cooperation between the two countries, nor to the settlement of the dispute&quot; and reaffirmed its sovereignty over the islands.

Japanese Prime Minister Tarō Asō and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev met in Sakhalin on February 18, 2009, to discuss the Kuril Islands issue. Aso said after the meeting that they had agreed to speed up efforts to resolve the dispute so that it would not be left to future generations to find a solution.

====Visa issues====
Russia has given several concessions to Japan in the dispute. For example, Russia has introduced visa-free trips for Japanese citizens to the Kuril Islands. Japan&#x27;s fishermen are also allowed to catch fish in Russia&#x27;s claimed exclusive economic zone.

The Russian Head of the Kuril Region has called for dropping the visa-free programme and Japanese fishermen were fired upon for allegedly fishing illegally in Russian waters. A Japanese fisherman was shot dead by a Russian patrol in 2006.

====Visit by President Medvedev====
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was quoted by Reuters on September 29, 2010, as saying he planned a visit to the disputed islands soon and calling the South Kurils &quot;an important region of our country&quot;. The Japanese Foreign Ministry criticized Medvedev&#x27;s statement, calling it regrettable. Many analysts also viewed that the announcement of the visit is correlated with the recent joint declaration regarding World War II between China and Russia, and linked to the Senkaku Islands dispute between Japan and Taiwan. On November 1, Medvedev visited Kunashir Island, sparking a row with Japan. The visit by Medvedev was seen in Moscow as a signal to Japan that its loudspeaker diplomacy on the islands would fail. Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan called this visit &quot;impermissible rudeness&quot; and subsequently recalled his country&#x27;s ambassador to Moscow. The day after the visit, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Medvedev planned more visits to the disputed islands, sparking a warning from Tokyo.

====Reinforcement of defences====
On February 10, 2011, President Dmitry Medvedev ordered advanced weapons to be deployed on the Kuril Islands, &quot;in order to ensure the security of the islands as an integral part of Russia&quot;. On February 15, plans for deploying advanced anti-air missiles systems on the Islands were announced. According to a military source interviewed by Russia Today, as part of the reinforcements, the 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division may be upgraded to a modern motorized infantry brigade. The division is to receive an air defense brigade, possibly armed with S-400 SAM systems, according to the Russian General Staff. The Russian military has also announced intention to deploy the new Mistral class amphibious assault ships, and one &quot;Steregushchy&quot; class corvette in its Pacific Fleet to protect the islands. Russia signed a deal with France in January 2011 to buy four such vessels. However, the deal has since been canceled.

On March 25, 2016, Russian Minister of Defence Sergey Shoygu announced that Bal rocket systems in Kunashir, Bastion in Iturup and Eleron-3 UAVs are going to be stationed on the Kuril Islands within that year.
====Russian fighter jets intrusion====
On February 7, 2013, Russian Su-27 fighter jets entered airspace over Japanese territorial waters north of the island of Hokkaido. Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-2s were scrambled in response. Russia had been conducting scheduled flights over the Kuril Islands, but a spokesman for the Russian Air Force said that none of their aircraft entered Japanese airspace. This is the first incursion by Russian aircraft since 2008.

====2013 Abe visit to Moscow====
After winning the 2012 Japanese election, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe made good on promises to restart talks on the disputed nature of the islands. At the end of April 2013, he visited Moscow for discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Abe said: &quot;The potential for cooperation has not been unlocked sufficiently and it is necessary to increase the cooperation between our countries as partners&quot;; he added that he intended to have a good personal relationship with Putin as a basis for resolving the dispute.

====2017 Abe visit to Vladivostok====
Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and Russian President Vladimir Putin met at the Eastern Economic Forum, which was held at the Far Eastern Federal University in Vladivostok.

==== 2018 Abe visit to Vladivostok ====
Russian President and Japanese Prime minister met in Eastern Economic Forum in September 2018. Putin said, &quot;We agreed to hold the third Japanese–Russian business mission to the South Kuril Islands by the end of this year, after which the fourth round of negotiations on joint activities will take place.&quot;

On September 12, 2018, Russian president Vladimir Putin offered Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe a peace treaty &quot;before the end of the year, without any preconditions&quot;. Abe did not respond. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said &quot;there is absolutely no change to our country&#x27;s perspective of resolving the problem of rights over the Northern Territories before sealing a peace treaty&quot;.

==== 2018 East Asia Summit ====
At the Thirteenth East Asia Summit (November 2018) in Singapore, Shinzo Abe followed up on Vladimir Putin&#x27;s proposal from September in Vladivostok. He said that the leaders would seek a peace treaty to the terms of the 1956 Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration. The declaration gave Japan the Habomai islet group and Shikotan while the Soviet Union claimed the remaining islands, but the United States did not allow the 1956 treaty. Putin and Abe agreed that the terms of the 1956 deal would be part of a bilateral peace treaty.

==== January 2019 talks in Moscow ====
The Japanese foreign minister Taro Kono visited Moscow and held talks on the Kuril Islands dispute with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on January 14, 2019. At the conclusion of their meeting, Lavrov said that they agreed on wanting to increase ties between the two countries but serious differences remained between the Russian and Japanese positions on the issue. He also said that Japan must recognize them as sovereign Russian territory as a start. In a statement to reporters he had said &quot;Russia&#x27;s sovereignty over the islands isn&#x27;t subject to discussion. They are part of the territory of the Russian Federation.&quot; A couple days later on January 16, Lavrov questioned whether or not Japan has accepted the result of World War II.

A meeting between Vladimir Putin and Shinzō Abe on January 22 also did not bring about breakthrough.

==== 2020 Russia deploys missile systems ====
In October 2020, Russia said it planned to deploy an anti-air missile system for military drills on the Kuril Islands. On December 1, 2020, Russian Defence Ministry&#x27;s Zvezda TV station reported that Russia deployed several S-300V4 versions of the S-300VM missile system for combat duty on the disputed island Iturup. There were already short-range anti-aircraft missiles systems on Iturup.

==== 2021 Mishustin visit to Iturup Island ====
On July 26, 2021, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin visited the Iturup Island. Mishustin said Moscow planned to set up a special economic zone with no customs duties and a reduced set of taxes on the island chain.

==== 2022 return to old stance and halting of peace treaty talks ====
On March 7, 2022, Prime Minister of Japan Fumio Kishida declared that the southern Kurils are &quot;a territory peculiar to Japan, a territory in which Japan has sovereignty.&quot; On March 8, Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi described the four islands as an &quot;integral part&quot; of Japan. This was in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Japanese leadership had been reluctant to use language that could be seen as provocative by Russia when discussing the islands in recent years. When Shinzo Abe was asked if he considered the islands to be an integral part of Japan in 2019, he declined to respond so as not to damage negotiations with Russia. However, following the outbreak of Russia&#x27;s war against Ukraine and the implication of sanctions against Russia, the Japanese government has returned to a more hardline stance on the islands as shown by Kishida&#x27;s statement.

On March 21, 2022, Russia announced its withdrawal from peace treaty talks with Japan and freeze of joint economic projects related to the disputed Kuril Islands due to sanctions imposed by Japan over Ukraine.

On March 25, 2022, Russia started a military drill with over 3,000 troops and hundreds of vehicles on the Kuril Islands, including the disputed islands.

On March 31, 2022, Japan redesignated the disputed islands as being under an &quot;illegal occupation&quot; in a draft for the 2022 Diplomatic Bluebook.

On June 7, 2022, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova announced Russia&#x27;s intent to cancel a 1998 agreement with Japan allowing Japanese fishermen to operate near the southern Kuril Islands, claiming that Japan is not meeting the financial obligations outlined in the agreement.

On September 5, 2022, a document was published signed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin about Russia&#x27;s unilateral withdrawal from a visa agreement which allowed former Japanese residents to visit the disputed islands without visas. The Russian lawmaker said this was due to Japan&#x27;s participation in international sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine war.

==== Japan reaffirms its position that the islands are illegally occupied ====
On February 7, 2023, the 168th anniversary of the 1855 Treaty of Shimoda, Japan reaffirmed its position that it considers the four islands to be illegally occupied by Russia. In a statement, Fumio Kishida stated that &quot;It is completely unacceptable that the Northern Territories have yet to be returned since the Soviet Union&#x27;s illegal occupation of them 77 years ago&quot;. This was the first time in 5 years that the Japanese government had used the term &#x27;illegal occupation&#x27; when referring to the four islands.

On March 22, 2023, Russia said it deployed a division of its Bastion coastal defense missile systems to Paramushir. Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said it was to bolster Russian security around the Kuril Islands and partly in response to the United States efforts to &quot;contain&quot; Russia and China.

On April 21, 2023, Russia&#x27;s prosecutor general designated the League of Residents of Chishima and Habomai Islands (Chishima Renmei) as &quot;an undesirable organization&quot;. These former residents of the islands are likely barred from visiting the four disputed islands.

==Current views==
===Japan&#x27;s view===

Japan&#x27;s current view of the dispute is given in the official pamphlet of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

* The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration did not apply to the disputed islands because those islands had never belonged to Russia even before 1904–1905.
* Russia had not previously claimed the disputed islands since it began diplomatic relations with Japan in 1855. Therefore, the disputed islands could not be considered part of the territories acquired by Japan &quot;by violence and greed&quot;.
* The Yalta Agreement &quot;did not determine the final settlement of the territorial problem, as it was no more than a statement by the then leaders of the Allied Powers as to principles of the postwar settlement. (Territorial issues should be settled by a peace treaty.) Furthermore, Japan is not bound by this document, to which it did not agree.&quot;
* The Soviet Union&#x27;s 1945 entry into the war against Japan was a violation of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, and the occupation of the islands was therefore a violation of international law. Although the Soviet Union renounced the neutrality pact on April 5, 1945, Japan contends that the pact remained in effect until April 25, 1946, the 5 year anniversary of the pact&#x27;s ratification. However possibility of denunciation was described in third article of the pact: &quot;In case neither of the Contracting Parties denounces the Pact one year before the expiration of the term, it will be considered automatically prolonged for the next five years.&quot;
* Although by the terms of Article (2c) of the 1951 San Francisco treaty, Japan renounced all rights to the Kuril Islands, the Japanese government claims that the islands of Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and Habomai are not part of the Kuril Islands but &quot;Northern Territories&quot;. Also, the Soviet Union did not sign the San Francisco treaty.
* In addition, the Japanese government renounced its sovereignty over southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands from Sims to Urup, but the San Francisco Peace Treaty did not specify which country it belonged to, and the Soviet Union did not sign the treaty. Therefore, it claims that the land is undetermined under international law according to Article 25 of the treaty.

====Public attitudes in Japan====

In Japan, there are various private groups cooperating with local and national government to encourage the Japanese people to push for the return of the islands. One man whose family was evicted from the islands, Kenjirō Suzuki, heads the Tokachi branch of the League of &quot;Chishima Habomai&quot; Islands Residents (&quot;Chishima&quot; is the Japanese name for the Kuril Islands). In 2008, the main organization had a budget of approximately 187 million yen (US$1.7 million).

In 2018 the National Museum of Territory and Sovereignty (currently located in the Toranomon Mitsui Building, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo) was established by the Japanese government to raise public awareness of Japanese territorial rights issues concerning the Kuril Islands dispute, as well as issues concerning territorial claims to Takeshima and Senkaku Islands.

Many former Japanese residents of the disputed islands and their descendants live in Japan, and since 1964 some have been allowed to visit family graves for humanitarian reasons. However, they have long sought easier access, and the ability to land on islands other than Kunashir. In 2018, Russia started to allow visits to the smaller islands in the archipelago, under a new system involving checks of tour ships as they approached from the sea. The new procedure to process entry requests to the four Russian-held islands was expected to reduce travel time from five hours to about three hours.

===Russia&#x27;s view===
Russia maintains that all the Kuril Islands, including those that Japan calls the Northern Territories, are legally a part of Russia as a result of World War II, and the acquisition was as proper as any other change of international boundaries following the war. Moscow cites the following points:

* The explicit language of the Yalta Agreement gave the Soviet Union a right to the Kurils, and the Soviet Union upheld its own obligations under that treaty.
* Russia inherited possession of the islands from the former Soviet Union, as its successor state, in accordance with international law.
* The Japanese assertion that the disputed islands are not part of the Kurils is simply a tactic to bolster Japan&#x27;s territorial claim and is not supported by history or geography.

On December 21, 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin said at his annual news conference that the United States&#x27; military presence in Japan was complicating the search for a formal peace treaty between Moscow and Tokyo. Putin told reporters that Moscow was concerned by the deployment of a U.S. air defense system in Japan.

In March 2022, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy Chair of the Security Council of Russia, admitted that Russia was never serious about reaching a territorial agreement. He said: &quot;Obviously, we would never have found any consensus with Japan on the island issue … Negotiations about the Kurils always had a ritualistic character. The new version of the constitution of the Russian Federation [which was introduced in 2020] directly states that our country&#x27;s territories are not subject to alienation. The question is closed.&quot;

====Public attitudes in Russia====
In Russia, most of the population and mass media strongly oppose any territorial concessions to Japan. A common view is that the Soviet Union won the Kuril Islands during World War II and is entitled to keep them regardless of the prior history of the disputed territories. Many believe that taking these islands away from Japan was a just reward for the Soviet Union&#x27;s sacrifices during World War II and for its agreement to enter the war against Japan at the request of its allies. Zemlyak, a political group active in Kunashir during the 1990s, was an exception; it advocated a return of the islands to Japanese sovereignty.

Public polling in Russia has indicated consistent and overwhelming opposition to returning the islands to Japan. According to a July 2009 poll conducted by the All-Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTsIOM), 89% of respondents were against territorial concessions to Japan in the Kuril Islands dispute, compared to 76% from a similar poll in 1994. A May 2016 poll showed that the percentage of respondents that said they would support giving the islands to Japan was 7%. In November 2018 a similar poll was conducted, and the number supporting giving the islands was at 17%.

===Ainu view===

Some Ainu also claim the Kuril Islands, on the basis that their ethnic group inhabited the archipelago and Sakhalin prior to the arrival of Japanese and Russian settlers in the 19th century.

In 2004, the small Ainu community living in Kamchatka Krai wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin, urging him to reconsider any move to award the Southern Kuril Islands to Japan. In the letter they blamed the Japanese, the Tsarist Russians, and the Soviets for crimes against the Ainu such as killings and assimilation, and they also urged him to recognize the Japanese genocide against the Ainu people, a request which was turned down by Putin.

===Opinions of third party countries and organizations===
: The European Parliament issued a resolution &quot;Relations between the EU, China and Taiwan and Security in the Far East&quot;, adopted on July 7, 2005, which called on Russia to return to Japan the &quot;occupied&quot; South Kuril Islands.

: the United States maintained that until a peace treaty between Japan and Russia is concluded, the disputed Northern Territories remain under Russian control via General Order No. 1. In 2014 Marie Harf, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman stated that the United States recognized Japan&#x27;s sovereignty over the islands. Since 2018, the US government has required people seeking permanent residency (known as a green card) to list Japan as their birthplace if they were born on the four disputed islands.

 once supported the Soviet Union&#x27;s claim over the islands in the 1950s, however, after the Sino-Soviet split in the 1960s, China then turned to support Japanese sovereignty of the islands. After the Sino-Soviet border conflict in 1969, maps published in China began to mark the islands as Japanese territory with a note &quot;Occupied by Russia&quot;. During a news conference on July 27, 2021, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian commented on the issue of Russian–Japanese dispute of the islands. He said, &quot;It is China&#x27;s consistent belief that the outcomes of the victorious anti-fascist war should be earnestly respected and upheld.&quot; Russia often cites &quot;the results of the victorious war against fascism&quot; to justify its ownership of the islands following the defeat of Imperial Japan in World War II. By saying &quot;the results be respected&quot;, China apparently accepted the Russian argument. During a March 2023 meeting in Moscow, Xi Jinping reportedly told Putin that China &quot;does not take either side&quot; regarding the territorial dispute. This is a shift to neutrality compared to Mao Zedong who in 1964 said the islands belonged to Japan.
 is officially neutral in the Russia–Japan conflict over the islands.

&#x27;s national parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, voted on October 7, 2022, to recognize the Kuril Islands as integral Japanese territories, illegally occupied by the Russian Federation. The same day President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree recognizing the Kuril Islands as territory of Japan temporarily occupied by Russia.

 has called for bilateral negotiations between Japan and Russia over the ownership of the Kuril Islands.

==Challenges==
===Interests of both parties===
The meeting between the leaders of two countries that took place on May 5, 2016, in Moscow was expected to make progress in the resolution of a prolonged territorial disputes. However, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and Russian president Vladimir Putin focused on the &quot;current state and the prospects of development of bilateral cooperation in trade and economy as well as in the humanitarian field&quot;. Close to the end of May, Sergey Shoygu, the Russian Defence Minister, announced that Russia is ready to protect the islands against foreign air traffic over the islands by positioning defence systems along the main islands. Furthermore, on June 8, 2015, there was an order from the Defence Minister to expedite the construction of military facilities on Iturup and Kunashir islands. This news generated a wave of Japanese dissatisfaction. Although Japan objected to the actions of Russia, the latter did not show any signs for changing its plans. On November 19, 2018, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that upcoming talks about resolving a dispute with Japan over a group of islands claimed by Tokyo would not necessarily result in Russia relinquishing them.

====Political and strategic issues====
A Japanese online resource reports that military infrastructure that is springing up in the Kuril Islands is believed to be part of the future plan of &quot;Northern Sea Route&quot;, a sea route between the Kara Sea in the Arctic and the Pacific Ocean. The source believes that the route might be in hand to Russia since its power in the Pacific has been weakened for the last several decades. Moreover, the transfer of the Kurils to Japan would escalate territorial disputes Russia has with other countries.

<doc id="285058" wikidata="Q498647" url="?curid=285058" title="Vimana">
<text>Vimāna are mythological flying palaces or chariots described in Hindu texts and Sanskrit epics. The &quot;Pushpaka Vimana&quot; of Ravana (who took it from Kubera; Rama returned it to Kubera) is the most quoted example of a vimana. Vimanas are also mentioned in Jain texts. 

== Etymology ==

The Sanskrit word &quot;vimāna&quot; (विमान) literally means &quot;measuring out, traversing&quot; or &quot;having been measured out&quot;. Monier Monier-Williams defines &quot;vimāna&quot; as &quot;a car or a chariot of the gods, any self-moving aerial car sometimes serving as a seat or throne, sometimes self-moving and carrying its occupant through the air; other descriptions make the Vimana more like a house or palace, and one kind is said to be seven stories high&quot;, and quotes the Pushpaka Vimana of Ravana as an example. It may denote any car or vehicle, especially a bier or a ship as well as a palace of an emperor, especially with seven stories. Nowadays, &quot;vimāna, vimān&quot; or &quot;bimān&quot; means &quot;aircraft&quot; in Indian languages, for example, the Bangladesh Biman (national flag carrier of Bangladesh) and in the town names Vimanapura (a suburb of Bangalore) and Vimannagar (a town in Pune). In another context, Vimana is a feature in Hindu temple architecture.

== Hindu epics ==
=== Ramayana ===
In the Ramayana, the &quot;pushpaka&quot; (&quot;flowery&quot;) vimana of Ravana is described as follows:

The Pushpaka Vimana that resembles the Sun and belongs to my brother was brought by the powerful Ravana; that aerial and excellent Vimana going everywhere at will ... that chariot resembling a bright cloud in the sky ... and the King [Rama] got in, and the excellent chariot at the command of the Raghira, rose up into the higher atmosphere.

It is the first flying vimana mentioned in existing Hindu texts (as distinct from the gods&#x27; flying horse-drawn chariots). Pushpaka was originally made by Vishvakarma for Brahma, the Hindu god of creation; later Brahma gave it to Kubera, the God of wealth; but it was later stolen, along with Lanka, by his half-brother, king Ravana.

=== Mahabharata ===
A title of Uparichara was received by a king named Vasu after a Vimana (flying chariot) was granted to him by Indra, who was pleased with him. This chariot enabled him to wander (chara) above (upari) all mortals. The Vimana appeared as a crystalline entity in the sky.
== Jain literature ==
Vimāna-vāsin (&#x27;dweller in vimāna&#x27;) is a class of deities who served the . These Vaimānika deities dwell in the Ūrdhva Loka heavens. According to the &quot;Kalpa Sūtra&quot; of Bhadra-bāhu, the 24th himself emerged from the great ; whereas the 22nd emerged from the great vimāna Aparijita. The (4th) and Sumati-nātha (5th) both traveled through the sky in the &quot;Jayanta-vimāna&quot;, namely the great vimāna Sarva-artha-siddhi, which was owned by the Jayanta deities; whereas the (15th) traveled through the sky in the &quot;Vijaya-vimāna&quot;. A vimāna may be seen in a dream, such as the nalinī-gulma.

== Ashoka Edict IV ==
Ashoka mentions a model vimana (&quot;aerial chariot&quot;) as part of the festivities or procession which were organised during his reign.

== &quot;Samarangana Sutradhara&quot; ==
Chapter 31 of &quot;Samarangana Sutradhara&quot;, an 11th-century treatise on architecture, discusses machinery and automata, discussing their operation in terms of the four elements and aether, but suggesting that mercury may be an element in its own right. The author says he has personally seen most of the devices he describes in use, but does not specify which ones. The list includes two wooden aircraft, referred to as &quot;vimanas&quot;: a &quot;light&quot; one shaped like a huge bird and a &quot;heavy&quot; one shaped like a temple. Both types contain a fire chamber which heats a container of mercury, somehow causing the aircraft to rise from the ground. However, the description is purposely left incomplete for ethical reasons:

== &quot;Vaimānika Shāstra&quot; ==

The &quot;Vaimānika Shāstra&quot; is an early 20th-century Sanskrit text on aeronautics, obtained allegedly by mental channeling, about the construction of &quot;vimāna&quot;s, the &quot;chariots of the Gods&quot;. The existence of the text was revealed in 1952 by G. R. Josyer, according to whom it was written by one Pandit Subbaraya Shastry, who dictated it in 1918–1923. A Hindi translation was published in 1959, the Sanskrit text with an English translation in 1973. It has 3000 shlokas in eight chapters. Subbaraya Shastry allegedly stated that the content was dictated to him by Maharishi Bharadvaja. A study by aeronautical and mechanical engineering at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 1974 concluded that the aircraft described in the text were &quot;poor concoctions&quot; and that the author showed a complete lack of understanding of aeronautics.

== Ayyavazhi ==
Pushpak Vimana, meaning &quot;an aeroplane with flowers&quot;, is a mythical aeroplane found in Ayyavazhi mythology. Akilattirattu Ammanai, the religious book of Ayyavazhi, says that the Pushpak Vimana was sent to carry Ayya Vaikundar to Vaikundam.

A similar reference is found in regards of Saint Tukaram, Maharashtra, India. Lord Vishnu was so impressed by the devotion and singing of Saint Tukaram that when his time came, a Pushpak Viman (a heavenly aircraft shaped as an eagle) came to take him to heaven. Though it is believed that every other human being can go to Heaven without body, Saint Tukaram went to heaven with body (Sadeha Swarga Prapti).

== In popular culture ==
Vimanas have appeared in books, films, games, on the Internet, etc., including:

* Biman is the name of national airline of Bangladesh, its name derived from Sanskrit &quot;Vimāna&quot;.
* &quot;Vimana&quot; is an arcade game from Toaplan wherein the player&#x27;s ship earns the name.

<doc id="285059" wikidata="Q1366583" url="?curid=285059" title="Line of Control">
<text>The Line of Control (LoC) is a military control line between the Indian and Pakistanicontrolled parts of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir—a line which does not constitute a legally recognized international boundary, but serves as the &quot;de facto&quot; border. It was established as part of the Simla Agreement at the end of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Both nations agreed to rename the ceasefire line as the &quot;Line of Control&quot; and pledged to respect it without prejudice to their respective positions. Apart from minor details, the line is roughly the same as the original 1949 cease-fire line.

The part of the former princely state under Indian control is divided into the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The Pakistani-controlled section is divided into Azad Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan. The northernmost point of the Line of Control is known as NJ9842, beyond which lies the Siachen Glacier, which became a bone of contention in 1984. To the south of the Line of Control, (Sangam, Chenab River, Akhnoor), lies the border between Pakistani Punjab and the Jammu province, which has an ambiguous status: India regards it as an &quot;international boundary&quot;, and Pakistan calls it a &quot;working border&quot;.

Another ceasefire line separates the Indian-controlled state of Jammu and Kashmir from the Chinese-controlled area known as Aksai Chin. Lying further to the east, it is known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

== Background ==

After the partition of India, present-day India and Pakistan contested the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir – India because of the ruler&#x27;s accession to the country, and Pakistan by virtue of the state&#x27;s Muslim-majority population. The First Kashmir War in 1947 lasted more than a year until a ceasefire was arranged through UN mediation. Both sides agreed on a ceasefire line.

After another Kashmir War in 1965, and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 (which saw Bangladesh become independent), only minor modifications had been effected in the original ceasefire line. In the ensuing Simla Agreement in 1972, both countries agreed to convert the ceasefire line into a &quot;Line of Control&quot; (LoC) and observe it as a &quot;de facto&quot; border that armed action should not violate. The agreement declared that &quot;neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations&quot;. The United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) had the role of investigating ceasefire violations (CFVs), however their role decreased after 1971. In 2000, US President Bill Clinton referred to the Indian subcontinent and the Kashmir Line of Control, in particular, as one of the most dangerous places in the world.

== Characteristics ==

=== Terrain ===
The LoC from Kargil to Gurez comprises mountain passes and valleys with small streams and rivers. The area up to around is wooded while the peaks rise higher. Winter is snowy while summers are mild. From Gurez to Akhnoor, the area is mountainous and hilly respectively and is generally forested. There are tracks and minor roads connecting settlements. The mix of flora and elevation affects visibility and line of sight significantly.

=== Ceasefire violations ===
In 2018, two corps and a number of battalions of the Border Security Force manned the Indian side of the LoC. The Rawalpindi Corps manned the Pakistani side. Ceasefire violations (CFV&#x27;s) are initiated and committed by both sides and show a symmetry. The response to a CFV at one location can lead to shooting at an entirely different area. Weapons used on the LoC include small arms, rocket-propelled grenades, recoilless rifles, mortars, automatic grenade launchers, rocket launchers and a number of other direct and indirect weaponry. Military personnel on both sides risk being shot by snipers in moving vehicles, through bunker peepholes and during meals. 

The civilian population at the LoC, at some points ahead of the forward most post, has complicated the situation. Shelling and firing by both sides along the LoC has resulted in civilian deaths. Bunkers have been constructed for these civilian populations for protection during periods of CFV&#x27;s. India and Pakistan usually report only casualties on their own sides of the LoC, with the media blaming the other side for the firing and each side claiming an adequate retaliation.

According to Happymon Jacob, the reasons for CFVs along the LoC include operational reasons (defence construction like observation facilities, the rule of the gun, lack of bilateral mechanisms for border management, personality traits and the emotional state of soldiers and commanders), politico-strategic reasons, proportional response (land grab, sniping triggered, &quot;I am better than you&quot;, revenge firing), accidental CFVs (civilian related, lack of clarity where the line is) and other reasons (like testing the new boys, honour, prestige and humiliation, fun, gamesmanship). Jacob ranks operational reasons as the main cause for CFVs, followed by retributive and politico-strategic reasons .

=== Landmines and IEDs ===
Mines have been laid across the India–Pakistan border and the LoC in 1947, 1965, 1971 and 2001. The small stretch of land between the rows of fencing is mined with thousands of landmines. During the 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff thousands of acres of land along the LoC were mined. Both civilians and military personnel on both sides have died in mine and improvised explosive device (IED)-related blasts, and many more have been injured. Between January 2000 to April 2002, 138 military personnel were killed on the Indian side.

=== Posts and bunkers ===
Reinforced sandbagged and concrete posts and bunkers are among the first line of defence along the LoC. Armed soldiers man these positions with enough supplies for at least a week. The posts and bunkers allow soldiers to sleep, cook, and keep a watch on enemy positions round the clock. Some posts are located in remote locations. Animals are sometimes used to help transport loads, and at some posts animals are reared. The living quarters and the forward facing bunker are located at some distance apart. The locations of some posts do not follow any pre-ordained plan, rather they are in locations used during the First Kashmir War and the following cease-fire line, with minor adjustments made in 1972.

=== Indian LoC fencing ===

India constructed a barrier along the – LoC by 2004. The fence generally remains about on the Indian-controlled side. Its stated purpose is to exclude arms smuggling and infiltration by Pakistani-based separatist militants. The barrier, referred to as an Anti-Infiltration Obstacle System (AIOS), consists of double-row of fencing and concertina wire in height, and is electrified and connected to a network of motion sensors, thermal imaging devices, lighting systems and alarms. They act as &quot;fast alert signals&quot; for the Indian troops, who can be alerted and ambush the infiltrators trying to sneak in. 

The barrier&#x27;s construction began in the 1990s but slowed in the early 2000s as hostilities between India and Pakistan increased. After a November 2003 ceasefire agreement, building resumed and was completed in late 2004. LoC fencing was completed in the Kashmir Valley and Jammu region on 30 September 2004. According to Indian military sources, the fence has reduced the numbers of militants who routinely cross into the Indian side of the disputed region by 80%. In 2017, a proposal for an upgraded smart fence on the Indian side was accepted.

=== Border villages ===
A number of villages lie between the Indian fence and the zero line. Pakistan has not constructed a border fence, however a number of villages lie near the zero line. In the Tithwal area, 13 villages are in front of the Indian fence. The total number between the fence and zero line on the Indian side is estimated to be 60 villages and at least one million people are spread over the districts adjacent to the LoC from Rajouri to Bandipora.

=== Infiltration and military cross-LoC movement ===
According to the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs, 1,504 &quot;terrorists&quot; attempted to infiltrate India in 2002. Infiltration was one of India&#x27;s main issues during the 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff. There has been a decrease in infiltration over the years. Only a select number of individuals are successful; in 2016, the Ministry reported 105 successful infiltrations. The Indian LoC fence has been constructed with a defensive mindset to counter infiltration. The reduction in infiltration also points to a reduction in support of such activities within Pakistan. During the 2019 Balakot airstrike, Indian planes crossed the LoC for the first time in 48 years.

===Crossing points===

Pakistan and India officially designated five crossing points following the 2005 Kashmir earthquake—Nauseri-Tithwal; Chakoti-Uri; Hajipur-Uri; Rawalakot-Poonch and Tattapani-Mendhar. 

According to Azad Jammu and the Kashmir Cross LoC Travel and Trade Authority Act, 2016, the following crossing points are listed:

* Rawalakot–Poonch
* Chakothi–Uri
* Chaliana–Tithwal
* Tatta Pani–Mendher
* Haji Peer–Silli Kot

Trade points include: Chakothi – Salamabad and Rawalakot (Titrinote) – Poonch (Chakkan-da-Bagh). The ordinance passed in 2011. 

Between 2005 and 2017, and according to Travel and Trade Authority figures, Muzaffarabad, Indian Kashmiris crossing over into Pakistan was about 14,000, while about 22,000 have crossed over to the Indian side. Crossing legally for civilians is not easy. A number of documents are required and verified by both countries, including proof of family on the other side. Even a short-term, temporary crossing invites interrogation by government agencies. The Indian and Pakistani military use these crossing points for flag meetings and to exchange sweets during special occasions and festivals. On 21 October 2008, for the first time in 61 years, cross-LoC trade was conducted between the two sides. Trade across the LoC is barter trade. In ten years, trade worth nearly PKR 11,446 crore or has passed through the Chakothi – Salamabad crossing.
==== Chilliana – Teetwal ====

The Teetwal crossing is across the Neelum River between Muzaffarabad and Kupwara. It is usually open only during the summer months, and unlike the other two crossings is open only for the movement of people, not for trade. The Tithwal bridge, first built in 1931, has been rebuilt twice.

==== Chakothi – Salamabad ====
The Salamabad crossing point, or the Kamran Post, is on the road between Chakothi and Uri in the Baramulla district of Jammu and Kashmir along the LoC. It is a major route for cross LoC trade and travel. Banking facilities and a trade facilitation centre are being planned on the Indian side. The English name for the bridge in Uri translates as &quot;bridge of peace&quot;. The Indian Army rebuilt it after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake when a mountain on the Pakistani side caved in. This route was opened for trade in 2008 after being closed for 61 years. The Srinagar–Muzaffarabad Bus crosses this bridge on the LoC.

==== Tetrinote – Chakan Da Bagh ====
A road connects Kotli and Tatrinote on the Pakistan side of the LoC to the Indian Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir through the Chakan Da Bagh crossing point. It is a major route for cross LoC trade and travel. Banking facilities and a trade facilitation centre are being planned on the Indian side for the benefit of traders.

Most of the flag meetings between Indian and Pakistani security forces are held here.

==== Tattapani – Mendhar ====
The fourth border crossing between Tattapani and Mendhar was opened on 14 November 2005.

==Impact on civilians==
The Line of Control divided the Kashmir into two and closed the Jhelum valley route, the only way in and out of the Kashmir Valley from Pakistani Punjab. This ongoing territorial division severed many villages and separated family members. Some families could see each other along the LoC in locations such as the Neelum River, but were unable to meet. In certain locations, women on the Pakistan side on the LoC have been instrumental in influencing infiltration and ceasefire violations; they have approached nearby Pakistani Army camps directly and insisted infiltration stop, which reduces India&#x27;s cross LoC firing.

== In popular culture ==
Documentaries covering the LoC and related events include &quot;A journey through River Vitasta,&quot; Raja Shabir Khan&#x27;s &quot;Line of Control&quot; and HistoryTV18&#x27;s &quot;Kargil: Valour &amp; Victory.&quot; A number of Bollywood films on the 1999 Kargil conflict have involved depictions and scenes of the line of control including &quot;,&quot; &quot;Lakshya&quot; (2004) and &quot;Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl&quot; (2020). Other Bollywood films include &quot;&quot; and &quot;Bajrangi Bhaijaan&quot; (2015), and streaming television shows such as &quot;.&quot;

<doc id="285061" wikidata="Q1632482" url="?curid=285061" title="Karl Wallenda">
<text>Karl Wallenda (; January 21, 1905 – March 22, 1978) was a German-American high wire artist. He was the founder of The Flying Wallendas, a daredevil circus troupe whose members performed dangerous stunts far above the ground, often without a safety net.

==Personal life==
Wallenda was born in 1905 in Magdeburg, Germany. His parents were Kunigunde (Jameson) and Engelbert Wallenda, and he began performing with his family at the age of six.
==The Great Wallendas==

The Great Wallendas were noted throughout Europe for their four-man pyramid and cycling on the high wire. The act moved to the United States in 1928, performing as freelancers. In 1947, they developed the unequaled three-tier 7-Man Pyramid. Karl Wallenda had the idea since 1938, but it took until 1946, when he and his brother Hermann developed it and had the right acrobats for it. &quot;The Great Wallendas&quot;, a 1978 made-for-TV movie starring Karl Wallenda, depicts the act&#x27;s comeback after a fatal accident involving several family members during a performance. Wallenda was killed in a high wire accident in San Juan, Puerto Rico just 38 days after it was first broadcast.

==Daredevil stunts==

On July 18, 1970, a 65-year-old Wallenda performed a high-wire walk, also known as a skywalk, across the Tallulah Gorge, a gorge formed by the Tallulah River in Georgia. An estimated 30,000 people watched Wallenda perform two headstands as he crossed the quarter-mile-wide gap.

In 1974, at 69 years old, he broke a world skywalk distance record of at Kings Island, a record that stood until July 4, 2008, when his great-grandson, Nik Wallenda, completed a at the same location.

==Death==
Despite being involved in several tragedies in his family&#x27;s acts, Wallenda continued with his stunts. In 1978, at age 73, Wallenda attempted a walk between the two towers of the ten-story Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on a wire stretched 121 ft (37 metres) above the pavement. As a result of high winds and an improperly secured wire, he lost his balance and fell during the attempt. Wallenda was pronounced dead after his body arrived at the hospital. This was not viewed on most television stations, but a film crew from local station WAPA-TV in San Juan taped the fall with narration by anchorman Guillermo José Torres.

<text>Susannah Caroline Constantine (born 3 June 1962) is an English former TV fashion journalist, writer, style advisor, television presenter, author and clothes designer. Her second book, &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, co-written with her fashion partner Trinny Woodall, won her a British Book Award and sold 670,000 copies.

Constantine was born into a wealthy family; her father was successful in property and shipping sectors. She was privately educated as a child and went on to date David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley during the 1980s. Constantine has been involved in fashion for a long period, originally working in America for Giorgio Armani and then John Galliano in London. She met Trinny Woodall in 1994, with whom she proceeded to co-write a weekly fashion column, &quot;Ready to Wear&quot;. They founded Ready2shop.com, a dot-com fashion advice business, and wrote their first fashion advice book in 2000, &quot;Ready 2 Dress&quot;, both of which failed. From there they were commissioned to BBC Two to host the style series, &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, from 2001 to 2005. She made regular appearances as a style advisor on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and following her success on the shows, she went on to co-host &quot;Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress...&quot; on ITV in 2006 and &quot;Undress the Nation&quot; in 2007.

She has co-written fashion advice books with Woodall, some of which have become best-sellers in the United Kingdom and United States. It is estimated that her various style advice books have sold 2.5 million copies in Britain and the United States. Constantine and Woodall have designed their own clothing range for Littlewoods which made its debut in 2007, followed by the release of their latest fashion advice book, &quot;The Body Shape Bible&quot;.

==Early life==
Constantine was born at Hammersmith, and raised at Knipton, a small village in Leicestershire. Her father, Joseph Constantine, was an Old Etonian who served as an officer in the Coldstream Guards. He was of a Yorkshire landed gentry family that traces itself back to the 1100s. Through her paternal grandmother, Marie Leonie Francoise (née van Haaren), she is descended from Dutch prince William the Silent.

==Education==
Constantine was educated at boarding schools including Queen&#x27;s Gate School in South Kensington, London and St Mary&#x27;s School in Wantage, Oxfordshire which was run by Anglican nuns. She was first sent to boarding school at the age of 11 years, and recalls her first night away from home: &quot;I sobbed uncontrollably into my pillow.&quot;

In mid-2007, Constantine spoke about how she received a letter from St Mary&#x27;s School, inviting her to come back to the school to talk about her career and success to current pupils. Constantine immediately declined the offer and wrote &quot;No fucking way&quot; on the letter she had received.

== Early career ==
Constantine originally did a year of Montessori training after she had left school but she then moved onto other projects such as studying sculpture in Brussels. She later said of this time that she &quot;lost [her] virginity, went a bit mad.&quot; Constantine had taught children for three years, and also worked as a shop girl for Harrods. She wrote a book about present giving, which prompted &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to write an article implying she had never done a day&#x27;s work in her life, something which deeply upset her. She has stated &quot;I&#x27;ve &quot;always&quot; worked.&quot;

She worked as a shop girl in America for Giorgio Armani. She later came back to London working for designers Richard James, Patrick Cox, Alistair Blair and John Galliano which gained her an understanding of fashion. She then started working with the British Brain and Spine Foundation and consequently met the sports editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Whilst doing a piece for &quot;GMTV&quot;, he asked Constantine to report the women&#x27;s World Cup Final in cricket. She proceeded to write about cars and then fashion.

In 1994, she first met Trinny Woodall at a party hosted by David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley. The two women wrote &quot;Ready to Wear&quot;, a weekly style guide for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; for seven years. The column promoted affordable high-street fashion and they used themselves to illustrate which clothing suited which figure. Constantine and Woodall became the co-founders of Ready2shop.com, but the business venture failed, and investors lost a reputed £10 million.

Constantine made her television debut when Granada Sky Broadcasting signed her and Woodall to present a daytime shopping show called &quot;Ready to Wear&quot;, and they released their first fashion advice book, &quot;Ready 2 Dress&quot; in 2000. The book was unsuccessful and resulted in the pulping of 13,000 copies. Soon after the start of their television career, they secured a frequent makeover slot on the show &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;. It ensured that they had further exposure in television and gained attention from Jane Root, controller of BBC Two, who signed them up after their book venture and their internet business had failed badly.

== Television ==

=== 2001–03 ===
Constantine began co-hosting &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; with Trinny Woodall in 2001, in which they criticised participants&#x27; appearances and fashion style. Constantine and Woodall hosted &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; until 2005 and became renowned for their behaviour with the participants, direct advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits. A notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate&#x27;s underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible. Critics of &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects, a claim which they strongly disagree with. Constantine insists that their subjects &quot;see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know.&quot; She also stated &quot;Ultimately, what we&#x27;re doing is giving people confidence. We&#x27;re probably the only people who have an opinion, who care how ordinary people dress. No one at &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine gives a shit. They work with the designers, it&#x27;s more creative and artistic – they are creating something beautiful. But they don&#x27;t care about how their readers end up looking – whereas we do!&quot; The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah. One reporter has simply referred to Constantine as &quot;the one with &#x27;big tits&#x27;.&quot;

Constantine has the belief that &quot;anyone can achieve style. It doesn&#x27;t matter who you are or where you&#x27;re from.&quot; She also says that she finds dressing other women easy, but finds it difficult when dressing herself. Constantine and Woodall share the belief that dressing to flatter body shape is vital, stating &quot;For us, it’s all about shape, and how that is going to cure a bodily defect. We’re like clothing doctors.&quot;

During her time co-hosting &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, she and Woodall won a Royal Television Society Award in 2002 for being the best factual presenters. In 2002, Constantine advised Jeremy Clarkson on a celebrity version of &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;. After Clarkson appeared on the show, Nasir Khan stated &quot;I&#x27;d rather eat my own hair than shop with these two [Constantine and Woodall] again&quot;. The show was nominated for the Features Award at the BAFTAS in both 2002 and 2003. On the show &quot;Big Impression&quot;, impressionist Ronni Ancona took to spoofing Constantine&#x27;s presenting techniques on &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;.

For charity, in 2002 during the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children in Need&quot; programme, both Constantine and Woodall performed their own version of Madonna&#x27;s hit single &quot;Vogue&quot;. They became the faces of Nescafé in 2003 and featured in television advertisements promoting the brand of coffee. As part of their contract, Constantine and Woodall gave a Nescafé competition winner a £10,000 makeover.

=== 2004–05 ===
Following its ratings success, &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; was promoted from BBC Two to BBC One in 2004. The format was changed slightly, to a 60-minute show with two makeovers instead of a 30-minute show with only one makeover and also saw Constantine spending a day as one of her subjects. &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; was also aired in countries such as Spain and Portugal as well as in the American continent.

Constantine appeared on &quot;Children in Need&quot; in 2004, which included a special segment in which she gave the fictional &quot;EastEnders&quot; characters Little Mo and Mo Harris a makeover in the style of &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, commenting on them with her usual &quot;no nonsense&quot; approach. In 2005, Constantine voiced a robot version of herself in the science fiction series, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

&quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; has also seen Constantine and Woodall appearing twice as makeover and style experts. They also did an &quot;Oprah bra and swimsuit intervention&quot;. Reflecting on differences in women&#x27;s style and willingness to submit to makeovers between the UK and America, she stated that although there is not much difference, &quot;The Americans are slightly less adventurous,&quot; and that &quot;American women are more open to change and slightly more receptive victims.&quot;

=== 2006–present ===
In 2006, Constantine and Woodall moved from the BBC to ITV to start a new show, &quot;Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress...&quot;, on 3 October. The second series of &quot;Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress...&quot; was transmitted in June 2007, and it maintained the format of series one which saw Constantine and Woodall advising couples who were finding problems within their marriage. Constantine stated in an interview that filming the show was very emotionally draining, and as a result, she often went home crying. The programme did not come without its critics who questioned the depth at which Constantine and Woodall could deal with serious issues raised during the programme. On 16 October 2006, they both appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot; and performed makeovers on three women especially for the show.

The new series on ITV saw a change in format. In one episode exploring the theme of age, Constantine was transformed into a seventy-year-old with the use of prosthetics and makeup. She stated that it took her four days to get over the sight of herself aged so drastically, and compared the feeling to having an &quot;electric shock&quot;. Broadcasting was scheduled for 7 November 2007 and the programme is newly entitled &quot;Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress The Nation&quot;. On 5 November and 28 December 2007 Constantine and Woodall appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and performed makeovers on three women for the show and gave style advice according to the women&#x27;s shapes. They also reported on the fashion at the 80th Academy Awards especially for the show in 2008. Constantine and Woodall have dressed over 5,000 women as of 2007.

In 2015, Constantine took part in the fifteenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. She was the first campmate to be eliminated from the show.

On 21 August 2018, it was announced that Constantine would be a contestant on the sixteenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. Her professional dance partner was Anton du Beke. She and du Beke were the first couple to be eliminated from the competition after scoring the lowest scoring Samba and Foxtrot in the show&#x27;s history, both which scored just 12 points from the judges.

== Beyond television work ==
=== Online ===
In 2010, Constantine and Woodall starred in an online mockumentary series called &quot;Trinny and Susannah: What They Did Next&quot;.

An announcement was made that Constantine and Woodall would be touring New Zealand and Australia where they made a series of public appearances at shopping malls owned by the Westfield Group to perform live styling sessions for the company&#x27;s customers. Their appearances often attracted thousands of spectators. Before the tour, Constantine said &quot;We don&#x27;t know how New Zealanders dress but we are looking forward to getting over there and finding out.&quot;

=== Littlewoods ===
With Woodall, Constantine became the face of the home shopping company, Littlewoods Direct, after orders rose by thirty per cent when Littlewoods sponsored their ITV programme &quot;Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress&quot;. The pair produced a twelve-page fashion advice section within the Littlewoods catalogue and made a booklet called &quot;The Golden Rules&quot;, which was distributed to all Littlewoods customers with fashion advice to suit a range of body shapes. They have also produced online style guidelines for Littlewoods.

The first series of Littlewoods television advertisements featured Constantine and Woodall as themselves dressed as two agents trying to rob a Littlewoods designer warehouse, which was followed by Christmas adverts in 2007. The £12 million advertising campaign is one of largest ever for a home shopping and internet-based company. When the campaign began, Littlewoods&#x27; sales rose by 18 per cent, with brand awareness and customers visiting the website rising as well.

On 20 September 2007, Constantine and Woodall launched their own Littlewoods women&#x27;s clothing range which consists of trousers, coats and tops which like their underwear range, are designed to make certain areas appear slimmer. A series of eight dresses, cashmere knitwear, faux fur and sequinned shrugs also feature in the range.

=== Books ===
Constantine has co-written several style advice books with her fashion partner Trinny Woodall, which have sold over an estimated 2½ million copies worldwide. The fashion advice books have been number one bestsellers in Britain and the United States, appearing on both the Sunday Times bestseller list and The New York Times best-seller list, and have been translated throughout the world.

Their most successful book to date, &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, was published in 2002 which displayed chapters such as &quot;Big Tits&quot;, &quot;No Tits&quot; and &quot;Big Bum&quot; with fashion advice for each category. It became an instant best-seller with total sales reaching 670,000 copies. Before the prime book selling season, their book had sold 250,000 copies in Britain. The book was at one point selling 45,000 copies each week and sold 300,000 copies in just fifteen weeks, eventually making sales worth £8.7 million. Other success with the book includes winning a British Book Award in 2003 for the TV &amp; Film Book of the Year. Despite the book becoming an instant hit, Constantine and Woodall were only given an advance of £10,000. It was then reported that Constantine and Woodall secured a £1 million book deal to write more of their fashion books.

The pair&#x27;s latest book, &quot;The Body Shape Bible&quot;, was published on 18 September 2007. In the book, women can interpret which body shape they are, and can then be given adequate fashion advice on their own individual shape. A few pages in the book are also devoted to illustrating some of Constantine and Woodall&#x27;s own fashion disasters.

In 2017 she published her first novel, &quot;After the Snow&quot;.

=== Podcast ===
In January 2020, Constantine launched &quot;My Wardrobe Malfunction&quot;, a &quot;revealing podcast about our relationship with the items we wear&quot;. Guests were invited to share their &#x27;comfort blanket&#x27;, &#x27;burial suit&#x27; and &#x27;wardrobe malfunction&#x27;. The first season featured interviews with eight high-profile guests: Michelle Visage, Tan France, Elizabeth Hurley, Nile Rodgers, Trinny Woodall, Joe Sugg, Kristin Scott Thomas and Stacey Dooley. It continued throughout the year and, by December 2020, there had been five seasons and 40 episodes in total. Season six began on 4 February 2021 with Jane Seymour as the first guest.

== Personal life ==
When she was young, Constantine would rely on her father for fashion advice and has commented that any style that she has, she learned from him. He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions, although he was too modest to accept. His death came suddenly and was a milestone for Constantine.

Constantine became a fixture in 1980s British gossip columns and newspapers as the result of her relationship with Princess Margaret&#x27;s son, David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley, which lasted for eight years. Constantine admitted that her relationship with Linley undeniably opened doors for her, but after they broke up, she was keen to put the episode behind her and become well known in her own right. She dated Imran Khan, then a cricketer and playboy, later Prime Minister of Pakistan, in 1992. She also visited Pakistan in the time of the short-lived relationship. Constantine married Danish entrepreneur and businessman Sten Bertelsen, who launched Death cigarettes, with whom she has three children; Joe, Esme and CeCe. Constantine and her family bought a property in Sussex.

Constantine has spoken of the constant pressure to look good in public but affirms &quot;We&#x27;re as much in the business of dressing ourselves – but more importantly helping other women to do that.&quot; Constantine has admitted to a fear of growing older: &quot;I just don&#x27;t want to get old. Old women are invisible, and I don&#x27;t want to be invisible,&quot; she has said.

In 2002, while on a visit to the Cannes Film Festival, Constantine and Woodall were the victims of gem thieves. The thieves broke into the villa on the French Riviera where they were staying, rendered Constantine and Woodall unconscious with chloroform, and then stole money and jewellery.

Carol Vorderman was involved in a feud with Constantine and Woodall in 2003. Vorderman commented harshly about the double-act, referring to them as &#x27;Tranny and the Horse&#x27;, based on their appearance, after they had called her an &quot;overdone Eighties nightmare&quot; and named Vorderman in their list of the 20 worst-dressed celebrities.

===Views===
In August 2014, Constantine was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In August 2020, she said she hates cyclists so much that if she saw her own husband out on the road in Lycra, she would run him over. Speaking on the &quot;My Wardrobe Malfunction&quot; podcast, Constantine said “Oh I hate cycling, I won’t cycle. No, I fucking hate cyclists. My husband is a cyclist and if I see him on the road on his bicycle, I’m going to run him over... And the day when I know I’m about to die, I’m going to get in my car, aged 90, and I’m going to drive into cyclists wearing Lycra, kill the lot of them and go and die in Guam.”

<text>Sarah-Jane Duncanson &quot;Trinny&quot; Woodall (born 8 February 1964) is a British beauty entrepreneur, businesswoman, and the founder of cosmetics brand Trinny London.

Woodall initially rose to fame as a fashion and makeover expert, television presenter and author. With Susannah Constantine she formed half of the duo Trinny and Susannah; together they wrote a weekly fashion column for The Daily Telegraph before being commissioned by the BBC to host What Not to Wear in 2001. This was followed by several other television projects, books and clothing ranges.

== Early life ==
Woodall is the youngest of six children, including three half-siblings from her father&#x27;s first marriage. Her father was a banker, while her maternal grandfather was Sir John Duncanson, controller of the British steel industry in the last two years of the war, who went on to become managing director of the British Iron and Steel Federation (BISF) in August 1945 and then managing director of Lithgows in 1949.

When Woodall was five years old, she was sent home from school after cutting off another pupil&#x27;s plait. A family friend, Ronald Searle, who created the St Trinian cartoons that inspired the later films, likened her to a mischievous St Trinian girl, and the name Trinny stuck from then onwards. Woodall was educated at boarding schools from the age of six, which included Queen&#x27;s Gate School in Queen&#x27;s Gate, South Kensington, London. She also attended Baston School for Girls. She has described one of the boarding schools as &quot;cruel&quot; and &quot;sadistic&quot;. She has connected a fear of being naked with the time she was made to stand totally unclothed in front of the other pupils as a punishment for having a water fight. Woodall also attended boarding schools in France and Germany between the ages of twelve and fifteen. During her school years, she felt overshadowed by her older sister who was the &quot;star of the school&quot;, which prompted pupils to use Woodall to get to her sister.

==Career==

===Early career===
Woodall and Susannah Constantine first collaborated in 1996 on &quot;Ready to Wear&quot;, a weekly style guide for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; which ran for seven years. The style guide highlighted affordable high-street fashion, with the pair using themselves to demonstrate clothing that suited different figures. Woodall assumed the role of stylist and made the duo&#x27;s business decisions.

=== Television ===
Woodall and Constantine became household names as co-hosts and fashion advisors for five series of the BBC television series &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;. They combined their fashion knowledge and their infamous straight-talking advice to improve the dress sense of the candidates selected for the show.

In 2002, Woodall and Constantine won a Royal Television Society Award for their work on &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, in the category of best factual presenter. The show itself was nominated for the Features Award at the BAFTAS in both 2002 and 2003.

With &quot;What Not to Wear&quot; proving popular on BBC America, they frequently contributed as makeover and fashion experts on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;.

After &quot;What Not to Wear&quot;, Woodall and Constantine transferred from the BBC to ITV, and began their new television show, &quot;Trinny &amp; Susannah Undress...&quot;, in 2006.

Woodall has also made regular appearances giving fashion and beauty advice on shows such as This Morning, The Today Show and The Marilyn Denis Show.

In 2017 Woodall founded direct-to-consumer cosmetics brand Trinny London.

===Books===
Woodall and Constantine have co-written numerous fashion advice books, which have sold over 3 million copies worldwide. Their books have been translated throughout the world and have placed them number one on both &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; best-seller list and &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list.

In 2023 Woodall published the book &quot;Fearless&quot;, and an accompanying podcast of the same name.

== Awards ==
== Television credits ==
==Personal life==
Woodall married entrepreneur and former drummer Jonathan Elichaoff in 1999. They had a daughter about 2003. They divorced in 2009 after two years of separation. The divorce financial settlement eventually led to a complex and novel legal case in 2016. Elichaoff became bankrupt before the divorce was finalised and the trustee in bankruptcy sought to void the settlement, after Elichaoff took his own life in 2014, and make Woodall responsible for the bankruptcy debts of about £300,000. The case proceeded to hearings in the High Court, where the claim was rejected and later leave to appeal was denied, as orders over a divorce settlement can only be made during their joint lives.

In 2013, Woodall controversially began a relationship with Charles Saatchi. Saatchi had recently been divorced six weeks prior by ex-wife Nigella Lawson, following a notable incident of him strangling Lawson that came to light after being photographed by a paparazzi photographer. Woodall claimed to not know about the incident, despite it being widely publicised at the time. In 2023, after ten years, Woodall and Saatchi broke up, with Woodall citing she “felt alone” in the relationship, and that it felt “very good” to be single again.

<doc id="285073" wikidata="Q2033473" url="?curid=285073" title="Kobayashi Maru">
<text>The Kobayashi Maru is a fictional spacecraft training exercise in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; continuity. It is designed by Starfleet Academy to place Starfleet cadets in a no-win scenario. The &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; test was invented for the 1982 film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, and it has since been referred to and depicted in numerous other &quot;Star Trek&quot; media.

The nominal goal of the exercise is to rescue the civilian fuel ship &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot;, which is damaged and stranded in neutral territory between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. The cadet being evaluated must decide whether to attempt to rescue the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot;—endangering their ship and crew—or leave the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; to certain destruction. If the cadet chooses to attempt a rescue, an insurmountable enemy force attacks their vessel. It is described as testing the character of cadets rather than their actual skills, acclimating them to the emotional toll of defeat. A key plot point of many depictions is James T. Kirk becoming the only cadet to rescue the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; by hacking the simulation instead.

The phrase &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; has entered the popular lexicon as a reference to a no-win scenario. The term is also sometimes used to invoke Kirk&#x27;s decision to &quot;change the conditions of the test.&quot;

== Depiction ==

The test is introduced in the opening of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, with Lieutenant Saavik commanding her crew on a bridge simulator. They receive a distress call from the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; and enter the Klingon Neutral Zone to rescue it&quot;.&quot; The crew loses contact with the civilian ship and three Klingon vessels attack. With the bridge crew dead and the ship badly damaged, Saavik orders the crew to abandon ship and the simulation ends. When Saavik says the test is unfair because there is no way to win, Admiral James T. Kirk replies that a starship captain might face an actual &quot;no-win scenario&quot;. Later in the film, Kirk reveals that he beat the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; as a cadet on his third attempt by reprogramming the simulation to make it possible to rescue the ship, and that he does not actually believe in the idea of a no-win scenario. 

The 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot; shows an alternate timeline&#x27;s version of Cadet Kirk defeating the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; test; in contrast to the original timeline where Kirk was commended for his unorthodox approach, this version of Kirk receives an academic reprimand for violating the spirit of the test.

The test is also depicted in the &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; episode &quot;Kobayashi&quot;. Dal, who is struggling as the starship &quot;Protostar&quot;&#x27;s captain and does not understand the purpose of the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot;, repeats the simulation many times. Every attempt ends in failure, adding to his despondence. A holographic version of Spock advises Dal that &quot;the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few,&quot; and Dal finally solves the problem while realizing that he needs to listen to his crew more often. 

The &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; is referred to in other live-action and animated content, and characters also use the phrase &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; to describe no-win or desperate situations generally. The fourth-season premiere of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; is titled &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; (2021) and depicts the main characters confronting several challenging situations. Licensed media provide additional depictions of and references to the test, and two &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels carry the test&#x27;s name in their title: &quot;The Kobayashi Maru&quot; (1989) by Julia Ecklar and &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; (2008) by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels.

The simulation is performed in the novel &quot;Stone and Anvil&quot; (2003), a part of the &quot;Star Trek: New Frontier&quot; series by Peter David. In this version, Klingons are replaced by Romulans (the series takes place after the events of the sixth film) and the simulation is conducted on the holodeck. Captain Mackenzie Calhoun tries to save the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot;, but when he notices that the enemy ships are using it as cover, he orders it fired upon, resulting in two of the three enemy ships being driven towards each other and exploding. Having saved his crew, Calhoun orders them to escape.

== Concept and production ==
&quot;Star Trek II&quot; screenwriter Jack B. Sowards developed the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot;, naming it after his former neighbors. Kirk&#x27;s rejection of &quot;the no-win scenario&quot; in the film is one of several characterizations that reflected Sowards&#x27; own mindset at the time. Anticipating that news would leak of Spock&#x27;s death at the film&#x27;s end, Sowards had Spock and other known &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge officers feign their deaths as part of the opening &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; simulation; Kirk&#x27;s quip afterward to Spock—&quot;Aren&#x27;t you dead?&quot;—was Sowards&#x27; way of playing on that knowledge with the audience.

The &quot;all-star crew&quot; of Spock, Uhura, Sulu, and McCoy on the bridge simulator in &quot;Star Trek II&quot; motivated &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;&#x27;s producers to attempt to create a &quot;perfect&quot; bridge crew for a holodeck in their show. The writers could not reach consensus, and their lineup was limited by the availability of appropriate audio. Aaron Waltke, who wrote the episode, believed strongly that the characters should be voiced by the original actors, which meant finding either archived audio or recording new dialogue. Waltke did most of the research to find appropriate audio, which involved reading 90 scripts and watching 40 episodes from across the franchise; he called it &quot;one of the hardest writing experiences I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; The protagonist Dal&#x27;s (voiced by Brett Gray) holographic bridge crew ultimately consisted of Spock, Uhura, Scotty, and Odo, and they were &quot;voiced&quot; by mixing archival television and film dialogue of the characters as depicted by Leonard Nimoy, Nichelle Nichols, James Doohan, and René Auberjonois, respectively. Beverly Crusher was added when the writers realized someone needed to interact more directly with Dal, and Gates McFadden recorded new dialogue for the character.

==Critical response and impact==
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; test is one of the top ten elements of &quot;Star Trek&quot; with which non-fans are likely to be familiar; writing for Tor, Keith DeCandido said &quot;everyone knows that the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; refers to a no-win scenario&quot;. Craig S. Semon said that if the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film were popular with both general audiences and serious &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans, then director J. J. Abrams will have outperformed Kirk on the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot;. &quot;io9&quot; called &quot;Prodigy&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; and its impact on Dal &quot;surprisingly touching&quot;. 

After being diagnosed with terminal cancer, &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan Randy Pausch received an autographed picture of Kirk whose inscription from William Shatner echoed Kirk&#x27;s dialogue in &quot;Star Trek II:&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in the no-win scenario.&quot;

The term has been applied to real-world scenarios with no perceived positive outcome or that requires outside-the-box thinking, such as climate change, constitutional law, education, and the casting of the Ancient One character in &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;. Commentators have used Kirk&#x27;s unorthodox answer to the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; test as an example of the need to redefine the premises upon which an organization operates—changing the rules rather than playing within them. Computer security educators have used the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; to teach students to think like an adversary, and that by stepping outside the rules of the game one can redefine the game. Ideas and products focusing on immersive learning have also been compared to the realistic, immersive nature of the &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; test.

<doc id="285074" wikidata="Q1542985" url="?curid=285074" title="Congress of the Philippines">
<text>The Congress of the Philippines () is the legislature of the national government of the Philippines. It is bicameral, composed of an upper body, the Senate, and a lower body, the House of Representatives, although colloquially, the term &quot;Congress&quot; commonly refers to just the latter. The Senate meets at the GSIS Building in Pasay, while the House of Representatives meets at the Batasang Pambansa in Quezon City, which also hosts joint sessions.

The Senate is composed of 24 senators half of which are elected every three years. Each senator, therefore, serves a total of six years. The senators are elected at-large and do not represent any geographical district.

In the current 19th Congress, there are 316 seats in the House of Representatives. The Constitution states that the House &quot;shall be composed of not more than 250 members, unless otherwise fixed by law&quot;, and that at least 20% of it shall be sectoral representatives. There are two types of congressmen: the district and party-list representatives. At the time of the ratification of the constitution, there were 200 districts, leaving 50 seats for party-list representatives.

The district congressmen represent a particular congressional district of the country. All provinces in the country are composed of at least one congressional district. Several cities also have their own congressional districts, with some having two or more representatives. From 200 districts in 1987, the number of districts have increased to 253. Every new Congress has seen an increase in the number of districts.

The party-list congressmen represent the minority sectors of the population. This enables these minority groups to be represented in the Congress, when they would otherwise not be represented properly through district representation. Party-list representatives represent labor unions, rights groups, and other organizations. With the increase of districts also means that the seats for party-list representatives increase as well, as the 1:4 ratio has to be respected.

The Constitution provides that Congress shall convene for its regular session every year beginning on the 4th Monday of July. A regular session can last until thirty days before the opening of its next regular session in the succeeding year. The president may, however, call special sessions which are usually held between regular legislative sessions to handle emergencies or urgent matters.

==History==
===Spanish era===

During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, municipal governments, or Cabildos were established. One such example was the Cabildo in Manila, established in 1571.

While the Philippines was under colonial rule as part of the Spanish East Indies, the colony had no representation in the Spanish Cortes. Only in 1809, when the colony was made an integral part of Spain, did it gain representation in the Cortes. While colonies such as the Philippines were selecting their delegates, substitutes were named so that the Cortes could convene. The substitutes, and first delegates for the Philippines were Pedro Pérez de Tagle and José Manuel Couto. Neither had any connection to the colony.

By July 1810, Governor General Manuel González de Aguilar received the instruction to hold an election. As only the Manila Municipal Council qualified to elect a representative, it was tasked to select a delegate. Three of its representatives, the governor-general and the Archbishop of Manila selected Ventura de los Reyes as Manila&#x27;s delegate to the Cortes. De los Reyes arrived in Cadiz in December 1811.

However, with Napoleon I&#x27;s defeat in 1814, his brother Joseph Bonaparte was removed from the Spanish throne, and the Cádiz Constitution was abolished by Ferdinand VII, who returned to the absolute monarchy, that removed Philippine representation on the Cortes, among other things. Restoration of Philippine representation to the Cortes was one of the grievances by the Ilustrados, the educated class during the late 19th century.

===The Revolutionary era===

The Illustrados&#x27; campaign transformed into the Philippine Revolution that aimed to overthrow Spanish rule. Proclaiming independence on June 12, 1898, President Emilio Aguinaldo then ordered the convening of a revolutionary congress at Malolos. The Malolos Congress, among other things, approved the Malolos Constitution. With the approval of the Treaty of Paris, the Spanish ceded the Philippines to the United States. The revolutionaries, attempting to prevent American conquest, launched the Philippine–American War, but were defeated when Aguinaldo was captured in 1901.

===The American era===

When the Philippines was under American colonial rule, the legislative body was the Philippine Commission which existed from 1900 to 1907. The President of the United States appointed the members of the Philippine Commission. Furthermore, two Filipinos served as Resident Commissioners to the House of Representatives of the United States from 1907 to 1935, then only one from 1935 to 1946. The Resident Commissioners had a voice in the House, but did not have voting rights.

The Philippine Bill of 1902 mandated the creation of a bicameral or a two-chamber Philippine Legislature with the Philippine Commission as the Upper House and the Philippine Assembly as the Lower House. This bicameral legislature was inaugurated in 1907. Through the leadership of then-Speaker Sergio Osmeña and then-Majority Floor Leader Manuel L. Quezon, the Rules of the 59th United States Congress were substantially adopted as the Rules of the Philippine Legislature.

In 1916, the Jones Law changed the legislative system. The Philippine Commission was abolished, and a new bicameral Philippine Legislature consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate was established.

===The Commonwealth and Second Republic era===

The legislative system was changed again in 1935. The 1935 Constitution, aside from instituting the Commonwealth which gave the Filipinos more role in government, established a unicameral National Assembly. But in 1940, through an amendment to the 1935 Constitution, a bicameral Congress of the Philippines consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate was created. Those elected in 1941 would not serve until 1945, as World War II erupted. The invading Japanese set up the Second Philippine Republic and convened its own National Assembly. With the Japanese defeat in 1945, the Commonwealth and its Congress was restored. The same setup continued until the Americans granted independence on July 4, 1946.

=== The Independence era ===

Upon the inauguration of the Republic of the Philippines on July 4, 1946, Republic Act No. 6 was enacted providing that on the date of the proclamation of the Republic of the Philippines, the existing Congress would be known as the First Congress of the Republic. Successive Congresses were elected until President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law on September 23, 1972. Marcos then ruled by decree.

As early as 1970, Marcos had convened a constitutional convention to revise the 1935 Constitution; in 1973, the Constitution was approved. It abolished the bicameral Congress and created a unicameral National Assembly, which would ultimately be known as the Batasang Pambansa in a semi-presidential system of government. The Batasang Pambansa first convened in 1978, and elected a prime minister.
Marcos was overthrown after the 1986 People Power Revolution; President Corazon Aquino then ruled by decree. Later that year she appointed a constitutional commission that drafted a new constitution. The Constitution was approved in a plebiscite the next year; it restored the presidential system of government together with a bicameral Congress of the Philippines. The restored Congress first convened in 1987.

== Seat ==

The two houses of Congress meet at different places in Metro Manila, the seat of government: the Senate meets at the GSIS Building, the main office of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) in Pasay, while the House of Representatives sits at the Batasang Pambansa Complex in Quezon City. The two are around apart.

The Barasoain Church in Malolos, Bulacan served as a meeting place of unicameral congress of the First Philippine Republic.

After the Americans defeated the First Republic, the US-instituted Philippine Legislature convened at the Ayuntamiento in Intramuros, Manila from 1907 until 1926, when it transferred to the Legislative Building just outside Intramuros. In the Legislative Building, the Senate occupied the upper floors while the House of Representatives used the lower floors.

With the Legislative Building destroyed during the Battle of Manila of 1945, the Commonwealth Congress convened at the Old Japanese Schoolhouse in Sampaloc. Congress met at the school auditorium, with the Senate convening on evenings and the House of Representatives meeting every morning. The Senate subsequently moved to the Manila City Hall, with the House staying in the schoolhouse. The two chambers of Congress returned to the reconstructed Legislative Building, now the Congress Building in 1950. In 1973, when President Marcos ruled by decree, Congress was padlocked. Marcos built a new seat of a unicameral parliament in Quezon City, which would eventually be the Batasang Pambansa Complex. The parliament that will eventually be named as the Batasang Pambansa (National Legislature), first met at the Batasang Pambansa Complex in 1978.

With the overthrow of Marcos after the People Power Revolution, the bicameral Congress was restored. The House of Representatives inherited the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate returned to the Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate moved to the newly constructed building owned by the GSIS on land reclaimed from Manila Bay in Pasay; the Congress Building was eventually transformed into the National Museum of Fine Arts. The Senate will eventually move into a new building that they would own in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig.

== Composition ==

In the diagrams below, Congress is divided into blocs, with the colors referring to the political party of the person leading that bloc. The blocs are determined by the votes of the members in speakership or Senate presidential elections.

The Senate is composed of the winners of the 2019 and 2022 Senate elections. The House of Representatives is composed of the winners of the 2022 House of Representatives elections. In both chambers, the majority bloc is composed of members generally supportive of the incumbent presidency of Bongbong Marcos, while the minority blocs are those opposed. In the House of Representatives, there is an independent minority bloc, and 4 vacant seats.

In both chambers, membership in committees is determined by the size of the bloc; only members of the majority and minority blocs are given committee memberships. In the Philippines, political parties are liquid, and it is not uncommon for party-mates to find themselves in different blocs.

=== Leadership ===
Each chamber is headed by a presiding officer, both elected from their respective membership; in the Senate, it is the Senate President, while in the House of Representatives, it is the Speaker. The Senate also has a Senate president &quot;pro tempore&quot;, and the House of Representatives has deputy speakers. Each chamber has its own floor leaders.

== Voting requirements ==
The vote requirements in the Congress of the Philippines are as follows:

In most cases, such as the approval of bills, only a majority of members present is needed; on some cases such as the election of presiding officers, a majority of all members, including vacant seats, is needed.

== Sessions ==

A new session of Congress starts after every House of Representatives election. Under the 1935 Constitution as amended in 1940, mid-term elections for the Senate caused its membership to be changed mid-session. From 1945 to 1972, there were two Commonwealth congresses and seven congresses of the Republic, with the 2nd Commonwealth Congress becoming the 1st Congress of the Republic. Under the 1973 Constitution, the Batasang Pambansa was the legislature, with it having two elections. Under the 1987 constitution, each Senate election was synchronized with the House elections, with the first congress under that constitution being counted as the &quot;8th Congress&quot;, picking up from the last congress of the 1935 Constitution.

=== Per historical era ===
=== List of Congresses ===
== Latest elections ==
===Senate===

In the Philippines, the most common way to illustrate the result in a Senate election is via a tally of candidates in descending order of votes. The twelve candidates with the highest number of votes are elected.

===House of Representatives===
A voter has two votes in the House of Representatives: one vote for a representative elected in the voter&#x27;s congressional district (first-past-the-post), and one vote for a party in the party-list system (closed list), the so-called party-list representatives; party-list representatives shall comprise not more than 20% of the House of Representatives.

To determine the winning parties in the party-list election, a party must surpass the 2% election threshold of the national vote; usually, the party with the largest number of votes wins the maximum three seats, the rest two seats. If the number of seats of the parties that surpassed the 2% threshold is less than 20% of the total seats, the parties that won less than 2% of the vote gets one seat each until the 20% requirement is met.

<text>Mustique is a private island in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. It is part of the Grenadines, a chain of islands in the West Indies. The island is located within Grenadines Parish, and the closest island is the uninhabited Petite Mustique, located to the south.

The island&#x27;s year-round population of about 500 live mostly in the villages of Lovell, Britannia Bay and Dovers. The population rises to 1,200 in peak season. Ferry service is provided to the island from Saint Vincent on the M/V &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

The island is owned by the Mustique Company, a private limited company which is in turn owned by the island&#x27;s homeowners. The island has about 120 private villas, many of which are let through the Mustique Company. The company also owns a hotel and cafe on the island.

==Environment==
Mustique has several coral reefs. The land fauna includes tortoises, herons, iguanas and many other species. The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of lesser Antillean swifts, green-throated caribs, Antillean crested hummingbirds, brown pelicans, Cabot&#x27;s and royal terns, Grenada flycatchers, Saint Vincent tanagers and lesser Antillean bullfinches. The snake Barbour&#x27;s tropical racer, as well as two lizards – the green ameiva and bronze anole – inhabit the island. Hawksbill and leatherback sea turtles nest on the beaches.

==Early history==
The islands were originally inhabited by people who probably arrived from South America around 2500 BC, subsequently by the Arawaks from 250 BC to 1000 AD, and later by the Caribs, whose simple tools can still be found.

The history of European settlement of the island of Mustique, and of the Grenadines in general, dates back to the 15th century, when Spanish navigators first sighted this more-or-less linear group of small rocky islands and named them &quot;Los Pájaros&quot; or &quot;the birds&quot;, because they resembled a small flock scattered across the sea. During the seventeenth century the islands were renamed the &quot;Grenadines&quot; by pirates, who used the sheltered bays to hide their ships and loot. The indigenous people were soon outnumbered by European planters in the 1740s, who found they could grow sugar there in abundance, using enslaved African labour. Because Europe&#x27;s only sources of sugar at that time were limited quantities from the Canaries and Cyprus, the West Indies became economically significant. The Grenadines passed from France to the British in 1763; farmers Alexander Campbell and John Aitcheson bought the island of Mustique that year. The British built three forts. Cotton and sugar continued to be grown until 1834. 
The name &quot;Mustique&quot; comes from the French &quot;moustique&quot;, &quot;mosquito&quot;. The sugar industry lasted until the 19th century, when the cultivation of European-grown sugar beet dramatically reduced the demand for tropical sugar. Mustique&#x27;s seven plantations were abandoned and eventually swallowed up by scrub, leaving remnants, such as the sugar mill at &quot;Endeavour&quot; and its &quot;Cotton House&quot;. The Plantation House was built in the 18th century.

The island was mostly abandoned in the 1800s, but in 1835 (after the abolition of slavery) two plantations were reopened after ownership of the island passed to the Hazell family. They grew crops and raised sheep and goats. They also maintained a school for the island locals. In 1865 the two plantations were merged into one estate by the family.

==Later history==
Mustique was purchased from the Hazell family in 1958 for £45,000 by Colin Tennant, who became the 3rd Baron Glenconner in 1983. He initially planned to start farming, &quot;sea island cotton, beef and mutton&quot; but then decided to develop the island into an exclusive hideaway, after forming The Mustique Company in 1968. By that time, cotton production was failing.

A report details the state of the island in 1958:Apart from the villagers’ smallholdings, Mustique was a desolate island covered in jungle, scrub and cactus. It had no natural water, no roads, no jetty for landing a boat and millions of mosquitoes. There was one dilapidated building used for picking over the cotton, and the remaining villagers lived in corrugated tin shacks which desperately needed upgrading.

Significant improvements were made over the subsequent years. According to a 2018 report, &quot;since the 1960s, Mustique has been an exclusive sanctuary for royalty, rock stars, celebrities and heads of industry to relax in anonymity&quot;.

In 1960, Princess Margaret, the sister of Queen Elizabeth II, accepted as a wedding present Colin Tennant&#x27;s gift of a plot of land, where she built a villa called Les Jolies Eaux. She spent time on the island during her honeymoon. In the early 1970s, the princess often visited the island in the company of Roddy Llewellyn. Mustique, she said, &quot;is the only place I can relax&quot;. Before her death, the princess gave the property to her son David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley to avoid later payment of inheritance tax. He sold it in 1999 for a reported £2.4 million and Les Jolies Eaux was made available for rent.

In 1964, a new settlement was built, Lovell Village. The original inhabitants of the island were each given a plot of land and a new home in this location. Most of the island locals, who work in Mustique, (roughly 500 people) live in Lovell and for years were served by a church, school, restaurant, a medical clinic, a store and a police station. A May 2019 report indicates that other businesses are now located in the Lovell area: &quot;a seafood market ... a food market, two stores The Purple House and The Pink House ... and a general store that advertised liquor, wine and cigars&quot;. Serving locals and some tourists, the View Restaurant and Bar is located in Lovell.

When The Mustique Company was formed in 1968, its new manager Hugo Money-Coutts obtained import and other tax free status in return for an annual fee. Building and sales of the villas started soon afterwards.

The airport began operation in 1969. In that year, several new villas were built, and the Cotton House opened as a hotel. In the following years, roads were built (although golf carts and ATVs are the only powered mode of transport), electricity and communications became reliable, a desalination plant was built to provide potable water, and a medical clinic was opened. The costs of running the island school and medical facility are supported by an educational and medical trust. One report states that &quot;since 1968, more than $100 million has been invested in Mustique&quot;.

In 1971, the , referred to locally as the Antilles packboat, struck a reef not far off of the island and sank.

===New ownership and development===
In 1976, due to financial problems, Tennant sold a controlling interest (60%) in The Mustique Company to Venezuelan industrialists Hans Neumann and Alberto Vollmer Herrera. Neumann, a Czech national who had survived the Holocaust by hiding in plain sight in Berlin, led the operations for the consortium, while Vollmer provided financial backing. Having taken control of the island, Neumann appointed Brian Alexander in 1979 to take over the management of the Mustique Company. Alexander did not retire until August 2008. During Alexander&#x27;s tenure, homes were built for workers on the island.

Tennant remained the owner of a plot on the island until moving to Saint Lucia in 1992. However, by 1987, Tennant had sold his remaining shares of The Mustique Company to Hans Neumann. After 2007, major improvements were made on the island including a desalination plant, solar panels to provide electricity and the recycling of certain types of trash.

In 1988 Hans Neumann set up the ownership structure as it is today and Mustique Island was transformed into a private limited company with the 104 homeowners as minority shareholders. Until 2003, Hans Neumann followed by his daughter Ariana Neumann retained a seat on the board and a block of 30% of the shares, which continued to provide stability over the years as it prevented dramatic policy shifts or substantial deviations from the development plan.

As of 2019, The Mustique Company is managed by Roger Pritchard, who replaced Brian Alexander. He leads a staff of 450 who oversee every aspect of island life, management of the villas and security. The security and fire services are provided by a team of officers led by a former Scotland Yard chief. Every visitor must be registered with the security force.

The Mustique Charitable Foundation has been funding programmes for the island locals, such as scholarships, arranging for surgeons to visit the island and literacy programmes since 2018. The Mustique Charitable Trusts funds projects such as Disaster Management Education, refurbishment of the Milton Cato Memorial Hospital in Saint Vincent, school meal programmes, some literacy projects and after-school programmes, diabetes and hypertension screening, a hospice and tree planting.

==Amenities and activities==
Mustique Island has many notable features. One of which is Basil&#x27;s Bar in Britannia Bay. The Bar remains situated right on the water overlooking a striking-blue bay that provides mooring for yachts.

The business was owned by Basil Charles for over twenty years; he was previously the barman at Tennant&#x27;s Cotton House Hotel. In 2017, however he had sold the operation to The Mustique Company. After a renovation, the bar reopened in 2018. One report states that &quot;the makeover of Basil’s Bar sought to pay homage to its heritage (a legendary island institution), while updating it in a chic, sophisticated and playful way. New features include the open kitchen and hide-away corners for private moments&quot;. A jump-up is held every Wednesday night (as of 2019) at this restaurant/bar and on Sundays, it hosts Sunset Jazz evenings, both with live music. The Mustique Blues Festival in late January and early February is held at Basil&#x27;s Bar.

There are no golf courses on the island but the official website describes the activities available, in addition to tennis and picnicking:...scuba diving and sailing, to tennis club and exploring the island on horseback. Try the extreme sports of kite-surfing or deep sea diving and fishing, or take a more gentle approach, with a snorkel in the many hidden coves around the island followed by a nurturing spa treatment. Children are indulged with a host of fun activities, with water sports galore, drive in cinemas for golf buggies, tennis, pony camp, beach picnics and treasure hunts, kite flying competitions and children’s menus everywhere.

The primary beach is Macaroni on the Atlantic side; large waves make it more suitable for surfing than for swimming. Lagoon Beach on the west side is calmer &quot;but too shallow and seaweedy for swimming&quot; according to one review. Gelliceaux, a sheltered bay, is preferable for swimming.

Villas for rent (from $8,000 for one bedroom to $150,000 per week for 6+ bedrooms) include the royals&#x27; Les Jolies Eaux, the Indonesian-style Mandalay (built for David Bowie), Pangolin, a seven-bedroom Balinese home, Toucan Hill with its Moroccan theme and a &quot;travertine-like palace&quot;. Boats can be chartered at Endeavor Bay.

The Mustique Medical Clinic is open daily and there is an island pharmacy. In case of serious medical issues, evacuation can be arranged to Martinique or Miami.

==Residents and guests==
The island was historically home to fishermen. From the 1960s, its visitors began to include a group whose influence created its current cachet: Lord Glenconner, Oliver Messel, Princess Margaret, Tommy Hilfiger and Mick Jagger. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, made private visits to Mustique in 1966, 1977 and 1985. William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales, holiday in Mustique often.

David Bowie once owned an Indonesian-inspired multi-pavilion villa on the island, which he called Britannia Bay. However, he stopped visiting it, saying that &quot;the house was so tranquil and peaceful that he found it hard to get any work done.&quot; In 1994, Bowie sold the property for $5 million to business tycoon and poet Felix Dennis. After Dennis died in June 2014, the villa was renamed as the Mandalay Estate, and sold to entrepreneur Simon Dolan. 
In 1996, while on holiday at Mustique, Noel Gallagher wrote and demoed many of the songs that would later be released on the Oasis album &quot;Be Here Now&quot; (1997).

Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds spent Christmas 2019 on Mustique with the Bismarck family. Other people who have holidayed on Mustique over the years include Liam Gallagher, Johnny Depp, Kate Moss, Paul McCartney, Jon Bon Jovi, Peter Lynch, Denzel Washington, Pierre Lagrange, Tom Ford, John Travolta and Bryan Adams.

<text>Raoul Vaneigem (; ; ; born 21 March 1934) is a Belgian writer known for his 1967 book &quot;The Revolution of Everyday Life&quot;.

==Biography==
Vaneigem was born in Lessines (in Hainaut, Belgium) and studied romance philology at the Free University of Brussels from 1952 to 1956. He was a member of the Situationist International from 1961 to 1970.

Vaneigem and Guy Debord were two of the principal theorists of the Situationist movement. Vaneigem&#x27;s slogans frequently made it onto the walls of Paris during the May 1968 uprisings. His most famous book, and the one that contains the most famous slogans, is &quot;The Revolution of Everyday Life&quot;. In it, he challenged what he called &quot;passive nihilism&quot;, a passive acceptance of the absurdities of modernism which he considered &quot;an overture to conformism&quot;.

According to the website &quot;nothingness.org&quot;,

The voice of Raoul Vaneigem was one of the strongest of the Situationists. Counterpoised to Guy Debord&#x27;s political and polemic style, Vaneigem offered a more poetic and spirited prose. &quot;The Revolution of Everyday Life&quot; (&quot;Traité de savoir-vivre à l&#x27;usage des jeunes générations&quot;), published in the same year as [Debord&#x27;s] &quot;The Society of the Spectacle&quot;, helped broaden and balance the presentation of the SI&#x27;s theories and practices. One of the longest SI members, and frequent editor of the journal &quot;Internationale Situationniste&quot;, Vaneigem finally left the SI in November 1970, citing their failures as well as his own in his letter of resignation. Soon after, Debord issued a typically scathing response denouncing both Vaneigem and his critique of the Situationist International.

After leaving the Situationist International, Vaneigem wrote a series of polemical books defending the idea of a free and self-regulating social order. He frequently made use of pseudonyms, including &quot;Ratgeb&quot;, &quot;Julienne de Cherisy,&quot; &quot;Robert Desessarts,&quot; &quot;Jules-François Dupuis,&quot; &quot;Tristan Hannaniel,&quot; &quot;Anne de Launay,&quot; and &quot;Michel Thorgal.&quot; Further on, he defended freedom of speech in &quot;Nothing is sacred, everything can be said&quot;, edited by Robert and Emmanuelle Ménard, to whom the philosopher Michel Onfray dedicated his &quot;Traité d&#x27;athéologie&quot;, and later on Bruno Gaccio and Dieudonné M&#x27;bala M&#x27;bala, responded in &quot;Can everything can be said ?&quot;, prefaced again by Robert Ménard.

<text>Athleta Christi () was a class of Early Christian soldier martyrs or military saints, of whom the most familiar example is probably Saint Sebastian. It also could be used to refer to Christians with exemplary martial prowess, especially when fighting against non-Christians or heretics. 

==Usage==
Since the 15th century, the title has been a political one, granted by Popes to men who have led military campaigns defending Christianity. The militant Catholic hymn &quot;Athleta Christi nobilis&quot; (&quot;Noble Champion of the Lord&quot;), a hymn for Matins on 18 May, the feast of Saint Venantius, was written in the 17th century by an unknown author. The medieval precursors of the hymn are numerous and include hymns, responsories and antiphons dedicated to many saints and martyrs, even non-militant ones such as Cosmas and Damian.

Those who have held the title include:
* Ferdinand III of Castile, called by Pope Gregory IX.
* Louis I of Hungary, called by Pope Innocent VI.
* Simon de Montfort, called by Peter of Vaux de Cernay.
* John Hunyadi of Hungary, called by Pope Pius II.
* George Kastrioti Skanderbeg of Albania, called by Popes Callixtus III, Pius II, Paul II, and Nicholas V.
* Stephen the Great of Moldavia, called by Pope Sixtus IV.
* Vlad the Impaler of Wallachia, called by Pope Sixtus IV.

<text>Ann Margaret Veneman (born June 29, 1949) is an American attorney who served as the fifth executive director of UNICEF from 2005 to 2010. She previously served as the 27th United States secretary of agriculture from 2001 to 2005. Veneman served for the entire first term of President George W. Bush, and she left to take the UNICEF position. Appointed by the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on January 18, 2005, she took over the post on May 1, 2005, serving until 2010. Previously, she also served as secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, serving from 1995 to 1999, as well as United States deputy secretary of agriculture, serving from 1991 to 1993. Veneman was the first woman to serve as Secretary of Agriculture and the second woman to lead UNICEF, following her predecessor, Carol Bellamy.

==Early life and education==
Veneman was raised on a peach farm in Modesto, California. Her father, John Veneman, was former undersecretary of Health, Education and Welfare and member of the California State Assembly. She earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from the University of California, Davis, a Master of Public Policy from the Richard &amp; Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. She has also been awarded honorary doctoral degrees from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (2001); Lincoln University (Missouri) (2003); Delaware State University (2004) and Middlebury College (2006).

==Legal, political and corporate career==

Veneman began her legal career as a staff attorney with the General Counsel&#x27;s office of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District in Oakland, California, in 1976. In 1978, she returned to Modesto, where she served as a Deputy Public Defender. In 1980, she joined the Modesto law firm of Damrell, Damrell and Nelson, where she was an associate and later a partner.

Veneman joined the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Foreign Agricultural Service in 1986, serving as Associate Administrator until 1989. During this time she worked on the Uruguay Round talks for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). She subsequently served as Deputy Undersecretary of Agriculture for International Affairs and Commodity Programs from 1989 to 2020. From 1991 to 1993, she served as United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Deputy Secretary, the first woman appointed as the Department&#x27;s second-highest-ranking official. At this point Veneman took a break from political and administrative office to practice with the law firm and lobby group Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow and also served on several boards of directors and advisory groups.

In 1995, Veneman re-entered government, when she was appointed Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture, again being the first woman to hold the position. From 1999 to 2001, Veneman was an attorney with Nossaman LLP, where she focused her attention on food, agriculture, environment, technology, and trade related issues. On 20 January 2001 she was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate and sworn in as Secretary of Agriculture, a position she held until January 20, 2005.

==Personal life==

A lawyer, Veneman has practiced law in Washington, DC and California, including being a deputy public defender.

In 2002, Veneman was diagnosed with breast cancer and received successful treatment. Veneman is also a second cousin of &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas.
In 2015, Veneman signed an amicus brief asking the United States Supreme Court to nationally recognize same-sex marriage.[1]

==Record as Secretary of Agriculture==

As the 27th Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Veneman managed a department of 111,000 employees. Sworn in as the first female Secretary of USDA on January 20, 2001, her tenure included record farm income, record agricultural exports and the creation of stronger pest and disease protection systems for the country.

U.S. Senator Tom Harkin said at Veneman&#x27;s confirmation hearing, &quot;I was encouraged by the nomination of Ann Veneman to serve as Secretary of Agriculture. …She has solid experience and credentials in administering food and agriculture programs both here in Washington, rising to Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, and in her home state of California, where she served as Secretary of the California Department of Food and Agriculture.&quot;

===BluePrint for Agriculture===

To help lead USDA into the 21st century, in 2001 Veneman released a blueprint for agriculture, &quot;Food and Agricultural Policy: Taking Stock for the New Century&quot;. &quot;This publication outlines emerging trends in agriculture, with a focus on farm-sector policy, trade expansion, infrastructure enhancement, conservation and the environment, rural communities, nutrition and food assistance, and USDA program integration.&quot;

===Protection of Agriculture and the Food Supply===

Within weeks after taking office, Veneman confronted the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Europe, prompting stronger sanitary and phytosanitary measures. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, additional protections were implemented. She also provided strong leadership in protecting public health and animal health during outbreaks of avian influenza and exotic Newcastle disease in poultry, both of which were quickly eradicated. USDA also confronted various food safety recalls, prompting Veneman to take several actions to strengthen USDA&#x27;s regulatory oversight and protections.

On December 23, 2003, Veneman announced the discovery of a single cow with Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, in Washington State. This would be the very first incident of mad cow disease in the United States. The cow was determined to be of Canadian origin. After taking initial steps in response, one week later, on December 30, 2003, Veneman announced additional protective measures to be put into place. [4] These included a ban on &quot;downer,&quot; or nonambulatory cattle, from the human food supply; additional food-safety measures in the processing of beef and related products; and an acceleration of &quot;the development of the technology architecture&quot; for a national system to track and identify livestock. 

BSE proved to be a complex issue on the international-trade front. U.S. trading partners made sometimes-conflicting demands on the United States, while public-interest, consumer and farm groups called for differing protection measures and responses.

Japan, the leading U.S. beef-export market, had been demanding 100 percent testing of all cattle for export, a position it has since altered.

Public-interest groups also called for the closing of loopholes in the so-called &quot;animal-feed ban,&quot; which prevented the feeding of ruminant products back to ruminants, which had been discovered as a key-pathway for BSE transmission. The feed ban falls under the purview of the Food and Drug Administration.

===International Trade===

Veneman, was widely praised for her knowledge and leadership in advancing international trade. &quot;She worked closely with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, helping lead to the successful launch of a new round of trade negotiations for the World Trade Organization&quot; in Doha. She played a key role in helping eliminate trade barriers and expanding opportunities for U.S. farmers through new export markets. U.S. agricultural exports in 2004 rose to a record $62.3 billion.

===Child Nutrition and Food Programs===

During Veneman&#x27;s tenure, the Food Stamp Program and child nutrition program were reauthorized and funding increased, strengthening the ability of USDA to provide services to recipients and provide additional accountability to taxpayers. In 2004, Veneman finalized the transition from paper food stamps to electronic debit cards in an effort to reduce fraud and increase availability of these programs to more families in need. Under Veneman, after a comprehensive scientific review, new Dietary Guidelines for Americans were released, which formed the basis for USDA&#x27;s MyPyramid.

Carol Tucker-Foreman of the Consumer Federation of America said of Veneman, &quot;Secretary Veneman recognized the increasing problem of obesity in this country and took some steps to begin to address it. Under her direction USDA updated the Dietary Guidelines and is revising the food guide pyramid.&quot;

As Secretary, Veneman focused on new approaches to help feed the hungry around the world. To help meet the international goal of reducing global hunger by half by 2015, she organized and hosted in 2003 the Ministerial Conference on Science and Technology, which brought together ministers from 120 nations to California, to discuss how science and technology can reduce hunger and poverty in the developing world. The conference, as well as subsequent regional conferences and follow-up activities, helped recapture the momentum of the World Food Summit.

===USDA Management and Programs===

As part of several actions to implement the President&#x27;s Management Agenda (PMA), Veneman began USDA&#x27;s e-Government Initiative, which made an unprecedented array of programs and services available electronically. In addition, USDA for the first time ever received a clean financial audit, a status the department attained three years in a row.

Veneman established USDA&#x27;s &#x27;Leaders of Tomorrow&#x27; initiative to support agriculture education and related mentoring. She increased the number of internships available at USDA, and encouraged young people to seek career opportunities at USDA and across the food and agricultural spectrum.

==Record as UNICEF Executive Director==

In her tenure as executive director from 2005 to 2010, Veneman, like her predecessors, continued to foster a culture of improvement, working to strengthen the results-based focus of the organization to most effectively and sustainably achieve the rights of children, in line with the convention on the Rights of the Child. This work included enhancing the following:

===Child-mother health===

Veneman has highlighted the inextricable link between the health of the mother and the health of the child in UNICEF. Along with WHO, the World Bank and UNFPA, UNICEF is accelerating maternal health interventions in the highest burden countries. Nutrition is now widely recognized as integral to both health and food security, with particular attention to children under age two whose cognitive ability will likely be permanently diminished without adequate nourishment in those formative years.

===Malnutrition===

UNICEF has significantly contributed to accelerating the use of ready-to-use therapeutic foods for treatment of acute malnutrition, with UNICEF purchases of the product increasing from 100 metric tons in 2003 to over 11,000 metric tons in 2008. Vitamin A and zinc supplementation, salt iodization, and flour fortification have all been scaled up and rates of exclusive breastfeeding have improved. UNICEF has strategically invested in nutrition programs when global food prices rose, and its recently released nutrition scorecard report provides data and evidence on the nutritional status of children.

===Protecting children===

In February 2007 UNICEF co-hosted a worldwide conference with France, bringing together representatives from 58 countries including those most affected by the use of child soldiers to end this practice. According to UNICEF over 27,000 children in different parts of the world are believed to have been used on the frontlines during armed conflicts in 2006 alone. To address this, the Conference resulted in the release of what is known as The Paris Principles, a detailed set of guidelines for protecting children from recruitment and for providing effective assistance to those already involved with armed groups or forces.

===Women and girls===

Veneman has helped bring more awareness to the plight of women and girls, saying, &quot;if we care about the health and well-being of children today and into the future, we must work now to ensure that women and girls have equal opportunities to be educated, to participate in government, to achieve economic self-sufficiency and to be protected from violence and discrimination.&quot; UNICEF has launched key interventions to enhance gender equality around the world. &quot;Despite progress in women&#x27;s status in recent decades, the lives of millions of girls and women are still overshadowed by discrimination, disempowerment and poverty.&quot; &quot;Millions of women...are subject to physical and sexual violence, with little recourse to justice.&quot;

In 2007, Veneman helped launch a partnership with renowned US playwright and &#x27;V-Day&#x27; founder Eve Ensler in 2007, to bring awareness and change to the sexual abuse and violence of women in the DRC. &#x27;Stop Raping our Greatest Resource&#x27; is a campaign initiated by the women of eastern DRC along with UNICEF and V-Day, a global movement to end violence against women and girls. UNICEF estimates that hundreds of thousands of women and girls have been raped since the conflict began in eastern DRC more than a decade ago.

Veneman has also called for greater efforts to end female genital mutilation. In February 2009, marking the International Day against the harmful practice that three million girls and women endure each year, Veneman said, &quot;Some 70 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to female genital cutting. While some communities have made real progress in abandoning this dangerous practice, the rights, and even the lives, of too many girls continue to be threatened.&quot;

===Organizational effectiveness===

UNICEF&#x27;s financial and organizational position has continued to improve due to its reputation. Between 2004 and 2008, total income, including trust funds, has increased more than 60%, to over $4 billion. The organization&#x27;s accountability mechanisms have been strengthened, audit compliance has improved, an office of investigation established, and an ethics officer appointed.

In December 2009, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said of Veneman, &quot;She has fulfilled her mandate with immense dedication, and I have been impressed by her extraordinary energy and determination to improve children&#x27;s health, education and well-being around the world. Under her leadership, UNICEF has become a catalyst for global action to help children reach their full potential, promoting collaborations that deliver the best possible results for children based on expert knowledge, sound evidence and data. She has been a champion of United Nations coherence and a strong voice for children as well as Millennium Development Goal implementation. Her legacy is an organization that is financially and intellectually strong and well-equipped to meet the challenges children face in the twenty-first century.&quot;

In 2009, Veneman was named to Forbes Magazine&#x27;s List of The World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women, ranking #46. Forbes cited Veneman in part because she &quot;played a key role in the joint effort by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Population Fund and the World Bank to help accelerate progress on maternal and newborn health in the 25 countries with the highest rates of infant mortality worldwide.&quot;

Mrs. Veneman was succeeded by Anthony Lake on May 1, 2010.

== Nestlé ==
After her time with UNICEF, Veneman served as an adviser to Nestlé and took a seat on Nestlé&#x27;s board of directors. Nutrition campaign groups criticized Veneman&#x27;s involvement with Nestlé because of the company&#x27;s violation of a global code restricting advertising of breast milk substitutes.

<text>Markku Tapani Toikka (born 5 April 1955 in Somero, Finland) is a Finnish stand-up comedian and actor.

His acting roles include &quot;Rahikainen&quot; in Aki Kaurismäki&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and &quot;Pekka&quot; in another Aki Kaurismäki film &quot;Calamari Union&quot;. In Calamari Union, Pekka appears for most of the film to gibber in English in an apparent schizophrenic delusion about his days as a soldier of fortune. This viewer interpretation is subverted towards the end of the movie, as a group of Latin American freedom fighters wreak their vengeance by shooting him like a dog.

As a stand-up comic, his shtick has largely been that of the balding middle aged man going through an identity crisis.

He lives in Helsinki with his wife, Ulla-Maija, and two children, son Toivo Toikka, who plays in band called &quot;Security&quot; and acts in amateur movies, and daughter named Tuuli.

<text>Macworld/iWorld (originally Macworld) was an information technology trade show with conference tracks dedicated to Apple&#x27;s Mac platform. It was held annually in the United States during January. Originally &quot;Macworld Expo&quot; and then &quot;Macworld Conference &amp; Exposition&quot;, the gathering dates back to 1985. The conference was organized by International Data Group (IDG), co-publisher of &quot;Macworld&quot; magazine.

On December 18, 2008, Apple announced that the 2009 Macworld Conference &amp; Expo would be the last in which the company participates. On October 14, 2014, IDG suspended Macworld/iWorld indefinitely.

==History==

The first Macworld Expo occurred in 1985 in San Francisco. The conference itself was created by Peggy Kilburn, who helped to increase the size and profit of the event during her tenure (1985–1999). Among the speakers recruited by Kilburn were David Pogue, Steve Case, Bob LeVitus, as well as representatives from BMUG, LaserBoard, and other major user groups. Participation by Apple was usually the central event of a Macworld Expo, and from 1997 through 2008, the show was known for its keynote presentations (sometimes called &quot;Stevenotes&quot;) delivered by Apple CEO Steve Jobs.

The San Francisco event has always been held at the Moscone Center. The Expo was also held in Brooks Hall near the San Francisco Civic Center from 1985 until 1993, when the expansion of Moscone Center allowed the show to be consolidated in one location.

Until 2005, the U.S. shows were held semiannually, with a January show in San Francisco and an additional summer show held in the Eastern US. The later event was held initially in Boston at the Bayside Expo &amp; Executive Conference Center, later expanding with a dual presence at the World Trade Center Boston. From 1998 to 2003 it took place in New York City&#x27;s Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The 2004 and 2005 summer shows, retitled &quot;Macworld Conference &amp; Expo&quot; took place in Boston, although without Apple&#x27;s participation. Other companies followed Apple&#x27;s lead, canceling or reducing the size of their own exhibits, which resulted in reduced attendance compared with previous Macworld conferences. On 16 September 2005, IDG announced that no further summertime shows would be held in NYC or in Boston.

The show has also taken place in other cities:
* A Tokyo show, produced by IDG World Expo Japan, was held at Makuhari Messe and moved to Tokyo Big Sight in 2002.
* Macworld Expo Summit, a version of the show targeted at U.S. government customers, was held at the Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. as late as 1994.
* In 2004, Macworld UK, part of the IDG UK division of IDG, created two &quot;Macworld Conference&quot; events on its own: one standalone conference, and one conference adjoining the MacExpo trade show in London.

===1987===
The 1987 Boston Macworld Expo was held on August 11–13. The most significant product introduction at the show was Bill Atkinson&#x27;s HyperCard. More than 3,000 copies of the software were handed out. MultiFinder, Apple File Exchange, the ImageWriter LQ, EtherTalk, AppleShare PC and the AppleFax Modem were among Apple&#x27;s product announcements. Promoters estimated 40,000 people attended the show. MacUser&#x27;s review of the show concluded positively, saying that it was &quot;revealing, exhilarating, and disappointing. While the Mac is clearly becoming the business machine of choice through much of corporate America, the show didn&#x27;t have the sterile atmosphere that pure business trade shows have. Most of the time it was plain outright exciting. And the promise of the future that was always in the air was wholly positive.&quot;

===1988===
The San Francisco Macworld was attended by 45,000 people and had 400 exhibits; Apple&#x27;s primary announcement for this show was a new family of LaserWriter printers.

===1991===
Outbound Computers demonstrated the first Macintosh-compatible portable computers at the Boston show, preceding Apple&#x27;s own introduction of the PowerBook by a couple of months.

===1995===
Macworld Expo took place in three locations: San Francisco (January 4–7), Washington DC (April 26–28), and Boston (August 8–11). Apple introduced the &quot;Power Surge&quot; line of Power Macintosh computers at the Boston show, consisting of the Power Macintosh 8500, 7500 and 7200.

===1997===
During Macworld in San Francisco, a focus in CEO Gil Amelio&#x27;s keynote was Apple&#x27;s recently-announced purchase of NeXT, which would include the return of company co-founder Steve Jobs in an advisory role, and the adaptation of its NeXTSTEP operating system into a future release of Mac OS codenamed &quot;Rhapsody&quot;. The signature hardware announcement of the show was the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, a limited edition model designed to mark the 20th anniversary of the founding of Apple Computer.

That August, Macworld in Boston featured Steve Jobs&#x27; first appearance at the exhibition as interim CEO, and came on the heels of the release of Mac OS 8. During his keynote, Jobs notably announced that Apple had reached several agreements with Microsoft to ensure the company&#x27;s stability, which included an agreement to settle patent disputes with Microsoft over its Windows operating system (including patent cross-licensing agreements), a $150 million stock investment in the company by Microsoft, a commitment for Microsoft to develop versions of Office for Macintosh for the next five years (beginning with the upcoming Office 98), and an agreement to ship Internet Explorer as the default web browser on future releases of Mac OS (with Netscape still available as an option alongside it). Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates made a remote appearance to acknowledge the partnerships, which was infamously met with a shower of boos from the audience.

Jobs argued that he wanted to abandon the notion of Microsoft and Apple needing to be rivals, explaining that &quot;we have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win, Apple has to do a really good job. And if others are going to help us that&#x27;s great, because we need all the help we can get, and if we screw up and we don&#x27;t do a good job, it&#x27;s not somebody else&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s our fault.&quot;.

===1998===
During Macworld in San Francisco, Jobs discussed Apple&#x27;s recent release of the Power Macintosh G3 and PowerBook G3, an agreement with CompUSA to establish &quot;store-within-a-store&quot; concepts devoted to its products, and the upcoming Mac OS 8.1 update (which introduced the new HFS+ file system, and support for UDF disks) and QuickTime 3.0. Jobs revealed that the company was on track to achieve a profit of $45 million by the end of the quarter, buoyed by the G3 Macs and the recent launch of the Apple online store. Microsoft also presented Internet Explorer 4.0 for Mac.

At Macworld in New York in July, Jobs addressed Apple&#x27;s return to growth and profitability (using a theme of the &quot;Apple Hierarchy of Skepticism&quot;, inspired by Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs), and also showcased a number of games being supported on Mac. He discussed aspects of the recently-announced iMac and PowerBook G3 Series (including new USB accessories for the computers), and announced that the iMac would be released August 15, 1998 release, and include a 56K modem at launch rather than the previously-announced 33K unit. Jobs also revealed a roadmap for upcoming Mac OS releases, including the upcoming Mac OS 8.5, a future update to Mac OS codenamed &quot;Sonata&quot; to be released in 1999, and that &quot;Rhapsody&quot; would be released as Mac OS X Server 1.0 in 1999.

===1999===
During Macworld in San Francisco, Jobs announced that the company had reached its fifth consecutive quarter of profitability. He unveiled the new &quot;Blue and White&quot; Power Macintosh G3, and a revision to the iMac with updated specifications and new color options. Part of the keynote also focused on the release of Mac OS X Server, featuring a demonstration of the NetBoot feature, and QuickTime Streaming Server by presenting a large wall of 50 diskless iMacs all streaming videos from the same Power Mac G3. Connectix presented its Virtual Game Station software for emulating the PlayStation on PowerPC Macs, and Microsoft demonstrated Internet Explorer 4.5 Macintosh Edition.

During Macworld in New York City, Jobs unveiled Apple&#x27;s new consumer laptop, the iBook, as well as AirPort, a wireless gateway and network card for wireless networking implementing the 802.11 specification. Jobs also announced a release date for Mac OS 9.

===2000===
Macworld 2000 in San Francisco featured the unveiling of the new &quot;Aqua&quot; user interface and &quot;Quartz&quot; graphics engine of Mac OS X, and Jobs&#x27; announcement that its first version would be released in January 2001 after a final preview release. Jobs also announced that he had been promoted to full-time CEO of Apple.

During Macworld in New York City, Apple unveiled a new iMac revision with upgraded specifications and a new suite of color options, updated Power Mac G4 models, the new optical Apple Pro Mouse (replacing the &quot;hockey puck&quot; mouse introduced with the iMac), and the Power Mac G4 Cube. It was also announced that the Mac OS X Public Beta had been delayed to September.

===2001===
At the San Francisco show, Apple introduced iTunes, and iDVD, an upgraded Power Mac G4 and the PowerBook G4, their first widescreen portable.

The New York show took place at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. Apart from an upgraded Power Mac G4 and the announcement of Mac OS X 10.1, there were no major announcements from Apple, but the keynote presentation did feature a segment on the megahertz myth, presented by Jon Rubenstein. Attendance was 64,000, a record for the event.

===2002===
The Summer 2002 show took place in New York City with a keynote on Wednesday, July 17. The keynote speech introduced the 17-inch version of the iMac G4.

In October 2002, IDG World Expo announced plans to move the 2004 edition of the East Coast show to Boston. The day of that announcement, Apple declared its intent not to participate in the Boston Macworld Expo.

===2003===
The January keynote introduced the Safari web browser, AirPort Extreme, 12- and 17-inch PowerBooks. This show also saw the launch of the world&#x27;s first interactive video CD-ROM, NightWatch.

In 2003, IDG World Expo renamed the New York trade show &quot;Macworld CreativePro Conference &amp; Expo&quot; in an attempt to reach the creative market in the New York area.

Steve Jobs was absent from the Macworld keynote held in New York in July, which was instead delivered by Vice President of Product Marketing Greg &quot;Joz&quot; Joswiak.

===2004===
Along with the usual show in San Francisco and the return to Boston, a Macworld Expo was held in Paris. At the Paris Expo, Apple&#x27;s VP of marketing Phil Schiller introduced the new updated iMac featuring a PowerPC G5 processor and other various updates, notably, the integration of the logic board and optical drive with the display.

===2005===

The San Francisco show was held January 10–14. The keynote introduced the Mac Mini, iPod shuffle, and iWork.

During the show, IDG World Expos announced &quot;Macworld On Tour&quot;, a series of small conferences in various North American cities. An initial conference, in Kissimmee, Florida, was later canceled. No future announcements for &quot;Macworld On Tour&quot; have been made. IDG announces Macworld East cancelled that there would be no Macworld East 2006.

===2006===

In January 2006, Intel Core Duo-based iMacs were announced to be ready for purchase. The conference was held January 9–13 and the number of visitors increased by 6.8% over the 2005 event, to 38,441. The number of paid conference delegates increased by 20% to 4,188, and the total number of exhibiting companies increased by 25% to 367.

===2007===
At Macworld 2007 (January 8–12), Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone mobile device, revealed the final name for the Apple TV (originally called by its code name iTV), and announced a change of name for the company from Apple Computer, Inc. to simply Apple Inc., reflecting its longtime focus on the user experience as opposed to the technology behind it.

IDG World Expo reported Macworld 2007 attendance as 45,572, a 19% increase over the previous year.

===2008===

At Macworld 2008 (January 14–18), Steve Jobs introduced the MacBook Air — touted as the world&#x27;s thinnest notebook computer; the Time Capsule device for use with the Time Machine application in Mac OS X 10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot;, iPod Touch updates including Mail, Stocks, Notes, Maps &amp; Weather, iTunes Movie Rentals, the Apple TV Take 2 updates with an all new interface, the ability to download TV shows, music, podcasts and rent or download movies without the need for a PC; and finally the iPhone/iPod Touch SDK launching in late February.

IDG World Expo reported that Macworld 2008 attendance increased 10% over the previous year.

===2009===

The San Francisco show went on January 5–9, 2009. On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that the 2009 conference will be the last in which the company would participate. The conference&#x27;s keynote address was delivered by Apple&#x27;s Senior Vice President of Product Marketing Phil Schiller, not Steve Jobs, as has been the custom for the past ten years. Steve Jobs issued a press release stating that the reasons for his absence were health related, specifically citing a hormone imbalance.

At Macworld 2009, Apple announced the release of iLife &#x27;09, iWork &#x27;09, and the new 17-inch unibody MacBook Pro with built-in battery. Also, Apple announced that iTunes would begin to sell all music DRM-free, with a three-tier pricing system per track: $0.69, $0.99, and $1.29 (or £0.59, £0.79, and £0.99 in the UK). This differs from Apple&#x27;s previous model with only one price per track of $0.99 (£0.79 in the UK). Apple also announced that tracks can now be downloaded over cellular networks on the iPhone.

===2010===

On March 30, 2009, IDG World Expo announced that the conference would be moving from January (during which it had taken place for 25 years) to February. They also said:

===2011===
The 2011 Macworld was held January 25–29, 2011.

===2012===

The 2012 Macworld/iWorld was held January 26–28. Just before registration opened for the 2012 conference, Macworld announced that they would be changing the name to Macworld/iWorld in addition to broadening the focus to all iOS devices.

===2013===
The 2013 Macworld/iWorld was held from January 31 to February 2, 2013.

===2014===

The 2014 Macworld/iWorld was held from March 27 to March 29, 2014.

===2015===
The 2015 Macworld/iWorld was scheduled to be held from March 12 to March 14, 2015, but was cancelled by IDG. Any further Apple keynotes would now be hosted under the name Apple Event.

==Culture==
During the Expo&#x27;s first two decades, it became legendary for the parties that coincided with it, frequently with open bars, lavish hors d&#x27;oeuvres, and requisite T-shirts and other premium favors. Apple&#x27;s developer parties featured high-profile entertainers like James Brown and Smash Mouth.

Several years after the start of the Expo, &quot;MacWEEK&quot; had launched its weekly trade magazine and simultaneously initiated an exclusive party known as Mac the Knife, named for its anonymous columnist that wrote the back page industry gossip and rumor section; after &quot;MacWEEK&quot;″s demise, the party was thrown by Ilene Hoffman, until Mac Publishing, owners of the Mac the Knife trademark, forbade her from using the name. The party continued, with appearances by the Macworld All-Star Band, under a series of names that referenced the Knife.

Robert Hess of &quot;MacWEEK&quot; was the original keeper of the Macworld Party List, which kept track of each leisure event after the show. Prior to his death in 1996, he reportedly requested Hoffman to maintain it; the list was subsequently renamed the Robert Hess Memorial Events List. The list shrank gradually as events became more sparse, and did not publish for the show in New York 2003, but has been published for subsequent San Francisco shows.

<text>Donald Louis Evans (born July 27, 1946) is an American businessman. He was the 34th U.S. Secretary of Commerce. He was appointed by his longtime friend George W. Bush and sworn into office on January 20, 2001. On November 9, 2004, the White House announced that Evans intended to resign by the end of January 2005.

Evans was chosen to be the Non-Executive Chairman of TXU Energy, following the completion of its acquisition by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG Capital.

==Early life==
Born in Houston, Texas, Evans attended the University of Texas at Austin, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering in 1969 and an MBA from the McCombs School of Business in 1973. While at UT, he was a member of Texas Cowboys, Omicron Delta Kappa and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

In 1975, Evans moved to Midland, Texas from Houston and began working on an oil rig for Tom Brown Inc., a large independent energy company now based in Denver. Ten years later he took the company over as CEO and continued running it until becoming Commerce Secretary.

==Political career==
Evans involvement with politics started in 1978, helping Bush to raise money for Bush&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful congressional campaign and would serve as campaign chairman for Bush&#x27;s successful Texas gubernatorial run in 1994 and re-election in 1998. Evans was then appointed to the University of Texas System Board of Regents for a 6-year term by Gov. Bush in 1995. In February 1997, Evans was selected as the board&#x27;s chairman by his colleagues, serving as chair from through the end of his term in 2001. Evans resigned from the board in January 2001 to become Commerce Secretary. He was a board member of the Scleroderma Research Foundation for eight years and a driving force behind Native Vision, a program that provides services to some 10,000 Native American children. He has been involved with the United Way of America for many years, serving as president in 1989 and Campaign Chair in 1981. He has been named Jaycees Man of the Year.

In April 2000, Evans was named campaign chairman of Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign and became the campaign&#x27;s primary fundraiser. On December 20, 2000, President-elect Bush announced his intention to nominate Evans as Secretary of Commerce. On January 4, 2001, Evans became the first of President-elect Bush&#x27;s Cabinet picks to face a confirmation hearing, appearing before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Evans was one of seven Cabinet members confirmed by the Senate via voice vote on President Bush&#x27;s first day in office, January 20, 2001. During Bush&#x27;s 2004 State of the Union he was the designated survivor and spent the night in a secure undisclosed location. In the event of an attack on the Capitol, he would have become President of the United States.

On October 29, 2001, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay telephoned Evans, asking for help in persuading the credit rating agencies to refrain from a downgrade. Evans expressed sympathy but did nothing to intervene.

In July and August 2003, Evans and his colleagues, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, took a bus across the country on their &quot;Jobs and Growth Tour&quot;, aimed at promoting the benefits of the Bush administration&#x27;s tax cuts.

Following Bush&#x27;s re-election, Evans announced his intention to resign as Commerce Secretary but pledged to stay in office until his successor was confirmed by the Senate. Carlos Gutierrez was sworn in as Commerce Secretary by White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card on February 7, 2005.

==Post-government work==
Multiple news publications reported on May 26, 2006, that Evans had emerged as the front-runner to take become United States Secretary of the Treasury pending John W. Snow&#x27;s then rumored resignation. However, on May 30, Henry Paulson was nominated to replace Snow.

Evans was CEO of the Financial Services Forum, a trade association representing the CEOs of financial services firms dedicated to using the Protect America Act to overtake legitimate economic development organizations, seeking to encourage an open and competitive global marketplace. Evans is chairman of the board of the George W. Bush Foundation.

==Personal life==
He is married to Penelope Evans.

He has a grandson named Mitchell Moon.

He has two granddaughters named Makenzie Moon and Emily Moon.

==Fictional portrayal==
Evans was portrayed by Noah Wyle in &quot;W.&quot;, Oliver Stone&#x27;s 2008 biopic of George W. Bush.

<text>Donald Thomas Evans (April 27, 1938 – October 16, 2003) was an American playwright, theater director, actor and educator.

==Early life and education==
Evans was born April 27, 1938, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Mary Evans. After serving in the United States Marine Corps, he graduated from Cheyney State College in 1962 and went on to Temple University, earning a master&#x27;s degree in 1968 and a Master of Fine Arts in 1972.

==Educational career==
In 1972, Evans became an associate professor at Trenton State College (later named The College of New Jersey), where he chaired the Afro-American Studies Department. He also was an adjunct professor at Princeton University and a visiting professor of theater arts at Rutgers University. During this time, Evans wrote essays and articles for &quot;Black World&quot;, &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Players, and Pride&quot;.

He worked from 1978 to 1998 with his friend and fellow playwright August Wilson in forming a National Black Theatre Summit at Dartmouth College, from which was formed the African Grove Institute for the Arts.

==Theatre==
Evans studied acting, directing, and playwriting at the Hagen-Berghof Studios in New York City from 1969 to 1970, during which time he also taught English and Drama at Princeton High School in Princeton, New Jersey. Part of the Black Arts Movement of the 1970s, Evans had his first plays, the one-acts &quot;Orrin&quot; and &quot;Sugarmouth Sam Don’t Dance No More&quot; performed in 1972 at the Crossroads Theatre, a professional playhouse in New Brunswick, New Jersey. The following year, this became his Manhattan debut production, at the Theater de Lys.

In 1976, Evans wrote &quot;It’s Showdown Time,&quot; a raucous adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;. In 1978, Evans wrote &quot;Mahalia,&quot; his first musical, a portrait of gospel vocalist Mahalia Jackson. &quot;Louis,&quot; Evans&#x27; musical portrayal of jazz legend Louis Armstrong, was written in 1981. Other works include &quot;Blues for a Gospel Queen&quot;, &quot;The Trials and Tribulations of Staggerlee Booker T. Brown&quot;. &quot;One Monkey Don&#x27;t Stop No Show&quot; a tragi-comic look at a middle-class black family, and &quot;A Lovesong for Miss Lydia&quot;, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a &quot;Pinteresque variation on the Big Bad Wolf story.&quot; Evans wrote his final play, &quot;When Miss Mollie Hit the Triple Bars&quot;, in 1999. It was based on the life of his mother, Mary.

Over the course of his career, Evans received playwriting fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New Jersey Council of the Arts, and the New Jersey Historical Society. Eighteen of his plays have been produced, both in the US and in countries including Germany, England and Hong Kong. He also served, from 1983 to 1988, as artistic director for the Karamu House in Cleveland, Ohio.

Don Evans was named an AMPARTS Fellow for the United States Information Agency to India in 1984.

==Personal life==
Evans was divorced from Frances Gooding Chapman. He had by two sons, Todd and Orrin, and a daughter, Rachel Marianno. He died at the age of 65 of a heart attack on October 16, 2003, at his home in Merchantville, New Jersey.

<text>The Australian National University (ANU) is a public research university and member of the Group of Eight, located in Canberra, the capital of Australia. Its main campus in Acton encompasses seven teaching and research colleges, in addition to several national academies and institutes.

Established in 1946, ANU is the only university to have been created by the Parliament of Australia. It traces its origins to Canberra University College, which was established in 1929 and was integrated into ANU in 1960. ANU enrols 13,329 undergraduate and 11,021 postgraduate students and employs 4,517 staff. The university&#x27;s endowment stood at A$1.8 billion as of 2018.

ANU counts six Nobel laureates and 49 Rhodes scholars among its faculty and alumni. The university has educated the incumbent Governor-General of Australia, two former prime ministers, and more than a dozen current heads of government departments of Australia. The latest releases of ANU&#x27;s scholarly publications are held through ANU Press online.

==History==

===Post-war origins===
Calls for the establishment of a national university in Australia began as early as 1900. After the location of the nation&#x27;s capital, Canberra, was determined in 1908, land was set aside for the ANU at the foot of Black Mountain in the city designs by Walter Burley Griffin. Establishment of the university was disrupted by World War II but resumed with the creation of the Department of Post-War Reconstruction in 1942, ultimately leading to the passage of the &quot;Australian National University Act 1946&quot; by the Chifley government on 1 August 1946.
A group of eminent Australian scholars returned from overseas to join the university, including Sir Howard Florey (co-developer of medicinal penicillin), Sir Mark Oliphant (a nuclear physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project), and Sir Keith Hancock (the Chichele Professor of Economic History at Oxford). The group also included a New Zealander, Sir Raymond Firth (a professor of anthropology at LSE), who had earlier worked in Australia for some years. Economist Sir Douglas Copland was appointed as ANU&#x27;s first Vice-Chancellor and former Prime Minister Stanley Bruce served as the first Chancellor. ANU was originally organised into four centres—the Research Schools of Physical Sciences, Social Sciences and Pacific Studies and the John Curtin School of Medical Research.

The first residents&#x27; hall, University House, was opened in 1954 for faculty members and postgraduate students. Mount Stromlo Observatory, established by the federal government in 1924, became part of ANU in 1957. The first locations of the ANU Library, the Menzies and Chifley buildings, opened in 1963. The Australian Forestry School, located in Canberra since 1927, was amalgamated by ANU in 1965.

=== Canberra University College===
Canberra University College (CUC) was the first institution of higher education in the national capital, having been established in 1929 and enrolling its first undergraduate pupils in 1930. Its founding was led by Sir Robert Garran, one of the drafters of the Australian Constitution and the first Solicitor-General of Australia. CUC was affiliated with the University of Melbourne and its degrees were granted by that university. Academic leaders at CUC included historian Manning Clark, political scientist Finlay Crisp, poet A. D. Hope and economist Heinz Arndt.

In 1960, CUC was integrated into ANU as the School of General Studies, initially with faculties in arts, economics, law and science. Faculties in Oriental studies and engineering were introduced later. Bruce Hall, the first residential college for undergraduates, opened in 1961.
===Modern era===
The Canberra School of Music and the Canberra School of Art combined in 1988 to form the Canberra Institute of the Arts, and amalgamated with the university as the ANU Institute of the Arts in 1992.

ANU established its Medical School in 2002, after obtaining federal government approval in 2000.

On 18 January 2003, the Canberra bushfires largely destroyed the Mount Stromlo Observatory. ANU astronomers now conduct research from the Siding Spring Observatory, which contains 10 telescopes including the Anglo-Australian Telescope.

In February 2013, financial entrepreneur and ANU graduate Graham Tuckwell made the largest university donation in Australian history by giving $50 million to fund an undergraduate scholarship program at ANU.

ANU is well known for its history of student activism and, in recent years, its fossil fuel divestment campaign, which is one of the longest-running and most successful in the country. The decision of the ANU Council to divest from two fossil fuel companies in 2014 was criticised by ministers in the Abbott government, but defended by Vice Chancellor Ian Young, who noted: ANU holds investments in major fossil fuel companies.

A survey conducted by the Australian Human Rights Commission in 2017 found that the ANU had the second-highest incidence of sexual assault and sexual harassment. 3.5 per cent of respondents from the ANU reported being sexually assaulted in 2016. Vice Chancellor Brian Schmidt apologised to victims of sexual assault and harassment.

The ANU had funding and staff cuts in the School of Music in 2011–15 and in the School of Culture, History and Language in 2016. However, there is a range of global (governmental) endowments available for Arts and Social Sciences, designated only for ANU. Some courses are now delivered online.

ANU has exchange agreements in place for its students with many foreign universities, most notably in the Asia-Pacific region, including the National University of Singapore, the University of Tokyo, the University of Hong Kong, Peking University, Tsinghua University and Seoul National University. In other regions, notable universities include Université Paris Sciences et Lettres the George Washington University, the University of California, the University of Texas, the University of Toronto in North America and Imperial College London, King&#x27;s College London, Sciences Po, ETH Zürich, Bocconi University, the University of Copenhagen and Trinity College Dublin in Europe.

In 2017, Chinese hackers infiltrated the computers of Australian National University, potentially compromising national security research conducted at the university.

==Campuses and buildings==

The main campus of ANU extends across the Canberra suburb of Acton, which consists of of mostly parkland with university buildings landscaped within. ANU is roughly bisected by Sullivans Creek, part of the Murray–Darling basin, and is bordered by the native bushland of Black Mountain, Lake Burley Griffin, the suburb of Turner and the Canberra central business district. Many university sites are of historical significance dating from the establishment of the national capital, with over 40 buildings recognised by the Commonwealth Heritage List and several others on local lists.

With over 10,000 trees on its campus, ANU won an International Sustainable Campus Network Award in 2009 and was ranked the 2nd greenest university campus in Australia in 2011.

Four of Australia&#x27;s five learned societies are based at ANU—the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Academy of the Humanities, the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and the Australian Academy of Law. The Australian National Centre for the Public Awareness of Science and the National Film and Sound Archive are also located at ANU, while the National Museum of Australia and CSIRO are situated next to the campus.

ANU occupies additional locations including Mount Stromlo Observatory on the outskirts of Canberra, Siding Spring Observatory near Coonabarabran, a campus at Kioloa on the South Coast of New South Wales and a research unit in Darwin.

===Drill Hall Gallery===

The Drill Hall Gallery is housed a drill hall dating from the 1940s, for use in training soldiers for the Second World War, and as base for 3rd Battalion, Werriwa Regiment. The interior was remodelled to create an art gallery in 1984, and in 2004 the building was heritage-listed. Temporary exhibitions of the national collection were held in the hall while the National Gallery of Australia was being built. ANU took over the hall in 1992 to exhibit its own collection of artworks, and also as a venue for temporary exhibitions.

There are four separate exhibition spaces, which provide the venues not only for exhibitions developed by or in collaboration with the university, but also to accompany major conferences and public events. The venue hosts both national and international exhibitions. Sidney Nolan&#x27;s panorama, &quot;Riverbend&quot;, which comprises nine panels, ís on permanent display at the Drill Hall Gallery.

== Governance and structure ==
=== University Council ===
ANU is governed by a 15-member Council, whose members include the Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor. Gareth Evans, a former Foreign Minister of Australia, was ANU Chancellor from 2010 to December 2019 and Brian Schmidt, an astrophysicist and Nobel Laureate, served as Vice-Chancellor from 1 January 2016 to 1 January 2024. Evans was succeeded as Chancellor by a fellow former Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, in January 2020. Schmidt was succeeded as Vice-Chancellor by cultural anthropologist and Distinguished Professor Genevieve Bell in January 2024.

===Constituent colleges===

ANU was reorganised in 2006 to create seven Colleges, each of which leads both teaching and research. Additional restructuring occurred in 2017, resulting in changes to the names and schools within the Colleges.

====Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences====

The ANU College of Arts and Social Sciences is divided into the Research School of Social Sciences (RSSS) and Research School of Humanities and the Arts (RSHA). Within RSSS there are schools and centres dedicated to History, Philosophy, Sociology, Politics &amp; International Relations, Demography, Arab and Islamic Studies, and European Studies, as well as the Australian National Centre for Latin and American Studies, Centre for Aboriginal Economic Policy Research, and the ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods.

RSHA contains schools of Archaeology and Anthropology; Art &amp; Design; and Literature, Languages and Linguistics, the latter of which include departments focusing on Linguistics &amp; Applied Linguistics; English, Screen, Drama &amp; Gender Studies; Languages &amp; Cultures, and Classical Studies.

Students are given the chance to spend three weeks in Geneva concerning the institutional practice of International Law.

====Science and Medicine====
The ANU College of Science and Medicine comprises the Research Schools of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, Biology, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, and Physics. Under the direction of Mark Oliphant, nuclear physics was one of the university&#x27;s most notable early research priorities, leading to the construction of a 500 megajoule homopolar generator and a 7.7 megaelectronvolts cyclotron in the 1950s. These devices were to be used as part of a 10.6 gigaelectronvolt synchrotron particle accelerator that was never completed, however they remained in use for other research purposes. ANU has been home to eight particle accelerators over the years and operates the 14UD and LINAS accelerators. Brian Schmidt (astrophysicist at Mount Stromlo Observatory) received the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for his work on the accelerating expansion of the universe.

The ANU College of Science &amp; Medicine encompasses the John Curtin School of Medical Research (JCSMR), ANU Medical School, National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, and Research School of Psychology. JCSMR was established in 1948 as a result of the vision of Nobel laureate Howard Florey.

==Student life==

=== Student association ===
Australian National University Students&#x27; Association (ANUSA) is the students&#x27; union of the Australian National University and acts as a representative body for the undergraduate, postgraduate and research students. The Australian National University Union manages catering and retail outlets and function amenities on behalf of all students.

=== Student newspapers and radio ===

==== &quot;Woroni&quot; ====
&quot;Woroni&quot; is one of the student publications of the Australian National University, first formed in 1950. Woroni is published fortnightly in full colour tabloid format, and features broad coverage of university and local news, opinion, features, arts and culture, sports, and leisure. Most of the newspaper since its beginnings have been digitised through the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program of the National Library of Australia. Woroni also features an online radio broadcast, Woroni Radio, as well as video production through Woroni TV.

==== &quot;ANU Observer&quot; ====
&quot;ANU Observer&quot; is another of the Australian National University&#x27;s student news publications. Founded in 2017, Observer is an online news site that covers breaking campus news, student life, student politics, arts and culture, sports, university policy and more. ANU Observer is an ANU student association, meaning all students are members by default (and can attend and vote at General Meetings.) Observer also produces a weekly podcast called &quot;Our Experts Have Observed&quot;, which can be accessed via Spotify or Apple Podcasts.

===Residential halls and colleges===

Eleven on-campus residential halls are affiliated with ANU—Bruce Hall, Burgmann College, Burton &amp; Garran Hall, Fenner Hall, John XXIII College, Ursula Hall, Wamburun Hall, Wright Hall, Yukeembruk Village, Graduate House and Toad Hall. Together these residence accommodate for undergraduate and postgraduate students. Four UniLodge residences are also available to ANU students, situated just off campus—Davey Lodge, Kinloch Lodge, Warrumbul Lodge and Lena Karmel Lodge. In 2010, the non-residential Griffin Hall was established for students living off-campus. Another off-campus student accommodation was launched by UniGardens Pty, University Gardens located in Belconnen.

In 2014, 2019 and 2020 there were major protests organised by student leaders across all of the ANU&#x27;s halls of residence against steep rent hikes, neglect of pastoral care support, and repeated failures to address issues relating to sexual assault and sexual harassment. Though supported by a majority of students living on residence, the ANU&#x27;s response to past protests has been mixed, with many recommendations and requests for student consultations ignored. The outcome of the 2020 protests revolve around demands for stronger SASH policy, accountability surrounding tariff rises, and commitments to adequate pastoral care; the outcome of these protests is as yet unknown. Protests have been held since on the issue, with one high-profile one occurring on the same day as the annual Open Day in 2024.

== Controversies ==

=== 2023 attack ===

In September 2023, an ex-student stabbed two female students and assaulted a male student with a frying pan. There were several injuries but no fatalities. ANU Chancellor Julie Bishop later called for the ACT government to explain why the university was not informed of the risk beforehand.

=== Network compromise ===
The network of the university was subject to serious compromise from 9 November to 21 December 2018. ABC News reported that the initial breach occurred when a phishing message was previewed. After investigating, the university published a report on the incident. Cyber safety recommendations are generally applicable.

<text>Murdoch University is a public university in Perth, Western Australia, with campuses also in Singapore and Dubai. It began operations as the state&#x27;s second university on 25 July 1973, and accepted its first undergraduate students in 1975. Its name is taken from Walter Murdoch, the Founding Professor of English and former Chancellor of the University of Western Australia.

The university is a verdant university and a member of the Innovative Research Universities. In 2018, Murdoch University was recognised as producing the most employable graduates of all Australian universities after three years of graduating from their courses. In 2019, the university ranked third in overall student satisfaction amongst all public universities in Western Australia.

== History ==
In 1962, the Government of Western Australia earmarked an area of land in Bull Creek to be the site of a future, second, state university. Integral to the planning of the creation of Western Australia&#x27;s second university was the planning for the School of Veterinary Science, which was to be the first professional faculty of the new university. It was decided that the new university would be named after Murdoch, a prominent local author, philosopher, and an Emeritus Professor at the University of Western Australia. When asked if he minded a new university in Western Australia being named in his honour, he was quoted as saying, &quot;No, but it had better be a good one.&quot;

Murdoch University was formally constituted on 25 July 1973. It was opened with an inauguration ceremony on 17 September 1974. This date was chosen as it was Murdoch&#x27;s 100th birthday. The Governor-General of Australia, John Kerr, attended the ceremony as the guest of honour. Lectures began in 1975, with 510 students initially enrolled for undergraduate programs. At the time, the young university was notable for its admissions policy of taking into consideration eligibility factors other than the school leaving exam results of students. Other universities later came to adopt this more holistic perspective of student eligibility for entrance into university education.

In late 2018, the university faced scandal subsequent to an enrolment surge of international students, many said to be &quot;lacking English language and computing skills&quot;. In 2019, a &quot;Four Corners&quot; investigation by the ABC found further deterioration of standards with allegations of foreign students being recruited as &quot;cash cows&quot;.

In May 2021, the university unveiled a new brand, replacing the traditional banksia logo with a simplified &quot;MU&quot; logo intended to be &quot;modern and future-focused&quot;, as well as signifying the university&#x27;s commitment to being a &quot;progressive&quot;, &quot;free thinking&quot; university.

== Campuses and buildings ==
Murdoch University has three Australian campuses: South Street Campus and Rockingham Campus in Perth, and Mandurah Campus.

=== South Street ===
The main campus is on South Street, Perth, in the suburb of Murdoch, near the Kwinana Freeway (). South Street Campus is Australia&#x27;s geographically largest campus at , large enough to accommodate the veterinary school and its animal stocks—the only such school in Western Australia. Most of the southern part of the university consists of paddocks of livestock, farms and renewable energy facilities.

The master plan for the campus included an open quadrangle of grass and trees, known as &quot;Bush Court&quot;, in the northern part of Murdoch campus, which rises to the highest altitude on campus. The library and first academic buildings flanking this court were designed by R. J. Ferguson, who also designed several buildings on the University of Western Australia campus. According to the foundation ethos of Murdoch University, there were to be no imposing buildings like the University of Western Australia&#x27;s grand, Mediterranean-style Winthrop Hall, with its imposing clock tower. Rather, the architecture adopts a low-slung form redolent of a homestead, with covered walkways suggesting a hybrid veranda or cloister around the bush court. In the smaller courtyards exotic gardens, including a Chinese garden of rocks and stones, contrast with the bush court. The planting and landscaping were the work of Marion Blackwell.

Features of the campus include the Joglo Rahayu (Peace Pavilion), a semi-enclosed pavilion near the Education and Humanities building. A monument to the ongoing association between Murdoch University and Indonesian academic institutions in Java, it acts as storage for the Western Australian Gamelan Orchestra.

The university recently established three &quot;myMurdoch Advice&quot; locations across campus, to assist with academic support, general advice about study, wellbeing and specialist advice for international students. A newly renovated Student Hub is located off Bush Court, including a variety of food chains and seating. The university also has a tavern and a restaurant named &quot;Sir Walter&#x27;s&quot;. A range of food trucks are also available via the Pop-Up Ref on the east side of the campus.

=== Rockingham Campus ===
The Rockingham Campus is located south of central Perth in the suburb of Rockingham (). Opened in 1996, it is co-located with Rockingham Challenger Institute of Technology campus, and features an arts and commerce building. The campus ceased offering undergraduate classes at the end of 2014 due to not enough students attending the campus.

==== Rockingham Regional Campus Community Library ====
Rockingham Regional Campus Community Library, located at the Rockingham Campus, is a joint venture between the university, the City of Rockingham and Challenger Institute of Technology. Members of all of these groups have free access to library membership.

Membership entitles all patrons to access to Challenger Institute of Technology, university and public library resources at Rockingham.

=== Mandurah Campus ===
The Mandurah Campus is located south of central Perth in the suburb of Greenfields, near the regional centre of Mandurah (). Opened in 2004, it is home to the School of Health Professions&#x27; Bachelor of Nursing (formally Nursing and Midwifery). In Semester 2, 2015, this degree also became available for study at the South Street Campus. Murdoch University shares the campus with Challenger Institute and John Tonkin College (formerly Mandurah Senior College).

=== Murdoch University Dubai ===
Murdoch University Dubai is a branch campus, established in 2008 in Dubai International Academic City to cater for the expanding Dubai media and financial sectors, and support Dubai&#x27;s ambitions in providing an ongoing reserve of regional graduates connected to the demands of the region&#x27;s booming industries.

The campus in Dubai offers degree programs in Commerce, Information Technology and Media and postgraduate programs in Business, Human Resource Management and Education. The Degree programs are fully compatible with those offered in Perth and carry full Australian accreditation as well as being certified by the Knowledge and Human Development Authority, Government of Dubai.

=== Murdoch University International Study Centre Singapore ===
The Murdoch University International Study Centre (MUISC) in Singapore was officially opened in June 2008 by Australian High Commissioner Mr Miles Kupa.

According to &quot;The Australian&quot;, The Graduate Careers Council of Australia found that Murdoch journalism graduates rated satisfaction with their course at a level within the top five nationally.

Murdoch University is the founder of the ACICIS (Australian Consortium for &#x27;In-Country&#x27; Indonesian Studies) Study Indonesia program, a non-profit consortium of Australian universities that was established in 1994 to coordinate semester-long study programs at partner universities in Yogyakarta and Malang in Indonesia, for Australian university students.

The Theology programme at Murdoch was, until its controversial closure in 2021, the most integrated of any Australian public University and included a full complement of staff working on-site.

The university is one of the partners in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study, one of the largest cohorts of pregnancy, childhood, adolescence and early adulthood to be carried out anywhere in the world.

The &quot;Australian National Phenome Centre (ANPC)&quot;, led by Murdoch University, is a world-leading research institute in metabolic phenotyping, as well as the only facility of its kind in the southern hemisphere. The ANPC is led by Professor Jeremy K. Nicholson, one of the most renowned academic in the areas of metabolomics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers at Murdoch University were at the forefront of studying the long-term biochemistry and symptomatology of the coronavirus, including the discovery of distinct blood signatures of patients who contracted the virus.

The university&#x27;s work with conservation management has including the protection of dugongs through drone-tracking devices, and the use of space technology to track movement patterns of vulnerable whale sharks. Murdoch researchers also work to protect the endangered native black cockatoos.

Murdoch was the subject of an ABC Four Corners report on selling of placements and the associated student visas to seemingly unqualified people including those who had been previously rejected for Australian visas. Subsequently, the Department of Home Affairs increased Murdoch&#x27;s risk rating.

=== Asia Research Centre and Indo-Pacific Research Centre ===
The Asia Research Centre, founded in 1991, produced multi-disciplinary research in politics, political economy, modes of governance, social change, and policy making. Its distinctive contribution to the research debate is based on the proposition that these factors have their roots in broader processes of conflict and change in society that are connected to the advance of market economies. The centre encompasses researchers from across Murdoch University. It also regularly engages in collaboration with researchers from other universities around the world.

In 2022, Murdoch University launched the Indo-Pacific Research Centre as the successor of the Asia Research Centre. The new centre facilitates innovative and policy-relevant research on security, conflict, development, and the environment in the Indo-Pacific region. As of 2024, Prof Jacqueline Lo is the director of the Indo-Pacific Research Centre.

<doc id="285109" wikidata="Q1144319" url="?curid=285109" title="Predicate (mathematical logic)">
<text>In logic, a predicate is a symbol that represents a property or a relation. For instance, in the first-order formula formula_1, the symbol formula_2 is a predicate that applies to the individual constant formula_3. Similarly, in the formula formula_4, the symbol formula_5 is a predicate that applies to the individual constants formula_3 and formula_7. 

According to Gottlob Frege, the meaning of a predicate is exactly a function from the domain of objects to the truth values &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;.

In the semantics of logic, predicates are interpreted as relations. For instance, in a standard semantics for first-order logic, the formula formula_4 would be true on an interpretation if the entities denoted by formula_3 and formula_7 stand in the relation denoted by formula_5. Since predicates are non-logical symbols, they can denote different relations depending on the interpretation given to them. While first-order logic only includes predicates that apply to individual objects, other logics may allow predicates that apply to collections of objects defined by other predicates.

== Predicates in different systems ==
A predicate is a statement or mathematical assertion that contains variables, sometimes referred to as predicate variables, and may be true or false depending on those variables’ value or values.
* In propositional logic, atomic formulas are sometimes regarded as zero-place predicates. In a sense, these are nullary (i.e. 0-arity) predicates.
* In first-order logic, a predicate forms an atomic formula when applied to an appropriate number of terms. 
* In set theory with the law of excluded middle, predicates are understood to be characteristic functions or set indicator functions (i.e., functions from a set element to a truth value). Set-builder notation makes use of predicates to define sets.
* In autoepistemic logic, which rejects the law of excluded middle, predicates may be true, false, or simply &quot;unknown&quot;. In particular, a given collection of facts may be insufficient to determine the truth or falsehood of a predicate.
* In fuzzy logic, the strict true/false valuation of the predicate is replaced by a quantity interpreted as the degree of truth.

<text>MacWEEK was a controlled-circulation weekly trade journal that focused on the Apple Macintosh. MacWEEK was based in San Francisco and founded by Michael Tchong, John Anderson, Glenn Patch, Dick Govatski, and Michael F. Billings. It featured a back-page rumor column penned by the pseudonymous Mac the Knife.

Founded in 1987, it was acquired by Ziff-Davis in 1988. In 1998, as part of a strategy change, the print publication was relaunched as &quot;eMediaWeekly&quot;, which caused a number of its existing sponsors to withhold their advertising. &quot;eMediaWeekly&quot; was published from August 24, 1998 to February 1, 1999. The online edition of MacWEEK continued for several years, originally under the editorial management of MacWEEK staff members and later under the management of former Macworld editors. It was later shuttered in favor of Mac Publishing&#x27;s Macworld and MacCentral sites.

Rumors about Apple and its products were often published in MacWEEK which essentially became the source of record. Apple employees, following the example of executive Jean-Louis Gassée, at times referred to it as &quot;MacLeak&quot;, yet some relied on it to distribute information they could not officially disclose, to draw internal corporate attention or funding to their projects, or to find out what was happening in their own company.

<doc id="285118" wikidata="Q426139" url="?curid=285118" title="Foramen magnum">
<text>The foramen magnum () is a large, oval-shaped opening in the occipital bone of the skull. It is one of the several oval or circular openings (foramina) in the base of the skull. The spinal cord, an extension of the medulla oblongata, passes through the foramen magnum as it exits the cranial cavity. Apart from the transmission of the medulla oblongata and its membranes, the foramen magnum transmits the vertebral arteries, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, the tectorial membranes and alar ligaments. It also transmits the accessory nerve into the skull.

The foramen magnum is a very important feature in bipedal mammals. One of the attributes of a biped&#x27;s foramen magnum is a forward shift of the anterior border of the cerebellar tentorium; this is caused by the shortening of the cranial base. Studies on the foramen magnum position have shown a connection to the functional influences of both posture and locomotion. The forward shift of the foramen magnum is apparent in bipedal hominins, including modern humans, &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;, and &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot;. This common feature of bipedal hominins is the driving argument used by Michel Brunet that &quot;Sahelanthropus tchadensis&quot; was also bipedal, and may be the earliest known bipedal ape. The discovery of this feature has given scientists another form of identifying bipedal mammals.

== Structure ==
The foramen magnum is a large, oval-shaped opening (foramen) in the occipital bone of the skull. It is present in humans, and in many other animals. Anteriorly, it is bounded by the basiocciput. Posteriorly, it is bounded by the supraocciput. Laterally, it is bounded by the occipital condyles.

On the occipital bone, the foramen magnum presents two midline cephalometric landmarks. The opisthion is the midpoint on the posterior margin of the foramen magnum. The basion is located at the midpoint on the anterior margin of the foramen magnum.

The alar ligament, which is attached on each side to the tubercle of occipital condyle, divides the foramen magnum into an anterior smaller compartment and a posterior larger compartment.

== Variation ==
From the size, position and where it is located the foramen magnum can help determine many factors. In humans, the foramen magnum is found to be located and positioned anteriorly. In some rodents and mammals, the foramen magnum can be found anteriorly in the cranium. 

The foramen magnum varies in size between individuals. Earlier ossification of the occipital bone leads to a smaller foramen.

The foramen magnum varies in size and shape when comparing different populations to each other. In humans, men tend to have a larger sized foramen magnum than women, but the overall shape is consistent.

In humans, the foramen magnum is farther underneath the head than in the other great apes. Thus, in humans, the neck muscles (including the occipitofrontalis muscle) do not need to be as robust in order to hold the head upright. Comparisons of the position of the foramen magnum in early hominid species are useful to determine how comfortable a particular species was when walking on two limbs (bipedalism) rather than four (quadrupedalism).

=== Heart-shaped foramen magnum ===
In an early hominin, &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot;, also known as &quot;Australopithecus boisei&quot;, has a foramen magnum that is similar to a shape of a heart or a cardioid. When KNM-ER 406 was examined among other species, the foramen magnum was different. Compared to the usual oval-shaped foramen magnum, the shape of the Australopithecus boisei foramen magnum appears to be shortened. In the foramen magnum of Australopithecus boisei, both the anterior and posterior are different in size and diameter. The anterior of the foramen magnum had a greater lateral diameter and was more broad compared to other early hominins. While the lateral diameter of the posterior foramen magnum was shortened to create more of a cardioid shape. The anterior edges of the foramen magnum in Australopithecus boisei lacks the oval curve that would normally appear in other species that have an oval to circular-shaped foramen magnum. The unique shape of the foramen magnum was also seen in some casts of Hadar species. The Hadar shows traits and characteristics of having a similar cardioid shape. The change in the shape of the foramen magnum has been studied to identify the possibility of different functions. There is a potential correlation between the change of shape of the foramen magnum to how it functions in the body. Although not proven, compared to other hominins, the route that blood travels through the foramen magnum in Australopithecus boisei are more straight and direct. With the enlargement and broadening of the anterior foramen magnum, allow for more venous drainage from the occipital and marginal sinuses. 

== Function ==
The foramen magnum transmits a number of important structures between the neck and the neurocranium.

Structures passing through anterior compartment (osseoligamentous compartment) include:

* the apical ligament and tip of the dens.
* the upper band of cruciate ligament of the atlas (C1 vertebra).
* the membrana tectoria.

Structures passing through posterior compartment (neurovascular compartment) include:
* the lower end of medulla oblongata, surrounded by meninges.
* the fourth part of the vertebral artery, surrounded by sympathetic plexus of nerves.
* accessory nerves.
* anterior and posterior spinal arteries.
* the tonsil of the cerebellum (occasionally) as in a tonsillar herniation known as a Chiari malformation.

== Clinical significance ==
The foramen magnum may be too large, too small, or the wrong shape. A small foramen magnum can cause neurological problems, and the reduced circulation of cerebrospinal fluid can cause hydrocephalus. This may be treated with suboccipital craniectomy.

== Other animals ==
An anterior foramen magnum can be found in other bipedal mammals besides humans. The jerboa, a bipedal rodent, also has a foramen magnum.

== Evolution of foramen magnum in fossils ==
Although not fully proven, there are many studies that show the possibility that where the foramen magnum is positioned in the cranium is significant in fossils. By being able to locate where the foramen magnum is positioned, anthropologists and other researchers are able to determine whether or not the species were bipedal (among other factors). The positioning of the foramen magnum changing over time can be seen in different fossils. Analyzing the foramen magnum in fossils like Ardipithecus ramidus, links the fossil to other earlier and later hominid who share similar anterior foramen magnum and other bipedalism features. Although not proven, there are correlations with the foramen magnum being more anterior positioned to the ability of mammals to walk on two limbs. Comparing this to other animals, such as some primates, the foramen magnum are located more of a posterior position in the cranium. With the foramen magnum being position anterior in the cranium, the body of bipedal mammals is given a different center of gravity compared to quadrupedal mammals. The anterior foramen magnum shifts the weight of the body more to the mammals&#x27; pelvis and femur, present in some primates, like great apes. With a posterior foramen magnum, the alignment and weight of the body falls more lateral under the head This allows for humans and other bipedal mammals to be able to walk on two limbs. Even with a posterior foramen magnum, some primates are still able to use their lower two limbs to walk.

With a common anterior foramen magnum in fossils, the fossils can be studied and researched to link mammals to others who are potentially bipedal. With more correlations and similarities of fossils who have an anterior foramen magnum; it links to the idea that these species might be bipedal. The shift in the foramen magnum moving towards a more anterior position in the cranium, gives rise to the idea of possible bipedalism.

<text>Mac the Knife was the pen name (inspired by the homophonous well-known song &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;) of an anonymous gossip columnist for the (now defunct) Apple Macintosh-focused trade publication &quot;MacWEEK&quot;. Mac the Knife was always written by a single writer, but the identity of that writer changed more than once over the long publishing history of &quot;MacWEEK&quot;. The column was known not only for its wide-ranging and often accurate Macintosh-related rumors, but for its gonzo, Hunter S. Thompson-like style.

Tipsters who provided juicy gossip were provided with coffee mugs emblazoned with the Knife&#x27;s logo. During the column&#x27;s heyday, the trophy mugs were occasionally sent randomly to Apple employees in order to obscure the true leakers.

&quot;MacWEEK&quot;&#x27;s party at Macworld Conference &amp; Expo was named for this fictional character. The party was often more secretive than Apple&#x27;s own parties, to protect the identity of the Knife.

During the latter part of the Knife&#x27;s career, his or her columns appeared on a website called The Electric Knife, which was published by Mac Publishing at , but after the Knife&#x27;s retirement, the domain expired. For some time, it was not associated with the Knife. Recently, it has been pointed at the defunct MacEdition homepage.

Today, none of the former Mac the Knife columnists write using this name. The columnist himself moved to MacEdition in 2000, penning a column called the &quot;Naked Mole Rat Report&quot; (an allusion to a phrase used in one of the Knife&#x27;s last columns). The column seems to have ceased publication in 2003.

Many of the later Mac the Knife columns are still available from the Internet Archive&#x27;s copy of the Electric Knife site.

<text>Drift migration is the phenomenon in which migrating birds are blown off course by the winds while they are in flight. It is more likely to happen to birds heading south in autumn because the large numbers of inexperienced young birds are less able to compensate than the adults heading north in spring.

Drift is assisted by disorientating conditions such as mist or drizzle, and can result in large numbers of birds arriving together in an area in which they are not normally seen. In the UK this is called a fall, while in the U.S. it is known as a fallout, though in the latter case, it need not involve vagrant birds.

An example would be an east wind in September blowing Scandinavian migrants such as bluethroats, wrynecks, and the continental race of robin onto the east coast of England and Scotland, leading to temporary concentrations of these species at headlands like Spurn.

<text>Genesis Energy Limited, formerly Genesis Power Limited is a New Zealand publicly listed electricity generation and electricity, natural gas and LPG retailing company. It was formed as part of the 1998–99 reform of the New Zealand electricity sector, taking its generation capacity from the breakup of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ) and taking retail customers from three local power boards in the Lower North Island. The New Zealand Government owns a 51% share of the company.

Genesis Energy is the largest electricity and natural gas retailer in New Zealand with 26% and 39% market share respectively in the 2015–2016 financial year. In 2015, Genesis produced 14% of New Zealand&#x27;s electricity, and is the third largest electricity generating company in New Zealand in terms of MW capacity, GWh generation and revenue (see comparison table at New Zealand electricity market).

== History ==
Genesis Energy began business on 1 April 1999, after the reform of the New Zealand electricity market and the breakup of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ). It took over the Huntly Power Station, Tongariro Power Scheme and Waikaremoana Hydro Scheme from ECNZ, and the Hau Nui Wind Farm and the Kourarau Hydro Scheme from Wairarapa Electricity. It also inherited the retail arms of Powerco, Central Power and Wairarapa Electricity, while Powerco and Central Power concentrated on electricity distribution (the distribution arm of Wairarapa Electricity merged with Powerco on the same day).

During 2000 to 2002 Genesis Energy purchased several electricity and gas retailing entities, following changes to laws governing the electricity industry. These included electricity retail businesses of Todd Energy, and electricity and gas customers from NGC (now Vector Limited) and Energy Online.

In September 2013, the company announced a change of name from Genesis Power Limited to Genesis Energy Limited.

On 17 April 2014, the National Government sold a 49% stake in Genesis Energy through an initial public offering at NZ$1.55 per share.

In February 2018, Genesis Energy announced a pathway to a coal-free electricity future for New Zealand by 2030.

In 2024, the company downgraded the reserves at Kupe by 81 petajoules of gas resulting in a $64 million writedown. This, along with other factors including a power station outage, resulted in a steep decline in profits although revenue was up.

== Power stations ==

Genesis Energy owns and operates a diverse portfolio of assets that includes hydroelectric, thermal and wind generation.

Genesis Energy operates three hydroelectric generating stations on the (361.8 MW) Tongariro Power Scheme – Rangipo (120 MW), Tokaanu (240 MW) and Mangaio (1.8 MW). It also operates the (138 MW) Lake Waikaremoana hydro scheme, comprising the Tuai (60 MW), Kaitawa (36 MW) and Piripaua (42 MW) stations.
On 1 June 2011, Genesis Energy purchased Tekapo A (27 MW) and B (160 MW) hydroelectric power stations from Meridian Energy.

Genesis Energy operates the Huntly Power Station, a (953 MW) coal- and gas-fired thermal plant on the Waikato River. In addition to two gas/coal-fired generating units, Huntly has a 50 MW open-cycle gas turbine unit that runs as base load, and a (403 MW) combined cycle gas turbine commissioned in June 2007 as a NZ$500 million project. Huntly also has a third coal unit, which can be taken out of storage within 90 days. The coal units are mainly used as hydro firming when New Zealand is in a dry winter.

The first of the four coal-fired units at the Huntly Power Station was taken out of service in late 2012. A second unit was placed into long-term storage in December 2013 and permanently retired in June 2015.

The company also operates the (7.3 MW) Hau Nui windfarm in the North Island.

===Future generation developments===

====Castle Hill====

Genesis Energy has resource consents for a wind farm at Castle Hill, 20 km north-east of Masterton in the northern Wairarapa. It is planning up to 286 turbines over a area, with a total installed capacity of up to 860 MW and potentially generating over 2000 GWh per year.

====Slopedown Wind Farm====
In 2010, Genesis Energy purchased the Slopedown wind from Wind Prospect CWP Ltd. It is 15 km east of Wyndham. Genesis Energy has not yet applied for resource consents.

==Community and sustainability investments==

=== Science Based Targets ===
Genesis has created Science Based Targets to align their sustainability goals to. They aim to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 36% and reduce scope 3 emissions 21%.

===School-gen and School-gen Trust===
Genesis Energy began its School-gen programme in 2006 to teach students about solar power, renewable energy and energy efficiency. The School-gen programme has created extensive teaching resources, including Maker Projects and eBooks that are free for any school in New Zealand. It has also provided 92 New Zealand schools with either a 2, 4 or 6 kilowatt photovoltaic (PV) solar panel system, at no cost to the schools. The largest solar array on a School-gen school is 16 kilowatts on Vauxhall School in Auckland. The PV system allows these schools to generate a portion of their electricity from the sun while also teaching students about solar energy.

=== Duffy Books in Schools ===
Duffy Books in Homes aims to encourage reading and supports students in lower socio-economic areas where the children are more likely to come from homes without access to books.

=== Whio Forever Project ===
Genesis Energy has partnered with the New Zealand Department of Conservation to help save the endangered native &quot;whio&quot; or blue duck. The Whio Forever Project includes a national recovery plan that will double the number of fully operational secure breeding sites throughout New Zealand and boost pest control efforts.

===Curtain Bank===
Genesis Energy is the major sponsor of the Wellington Curtain Bank and the Christchurch Curtain Bank. The curtain banks take donated second-hand curtains or fabric and re-cut and line them for distribution to households in need. This helps households in saving money on their energy bills and to create warmer, healthier homes. Some retailers offer a service in which they take down and donate your old curtains when installing new ones.

=== Ngā Ara Creating Pathways ===
This Genesis developed programme creates transformational education, training and employment opportunities to prepare young people in our local communities for the future of work.

=== POU at Huntly ===
POU is a marae-owned entity that delivers facilities maintenance services to Huntly Power Station.

<doc id="285129" wikidata="Q3510009" url="?curid=285129" title="Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto">
<text>Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto, also known as SARSStock, was a benefit rock concert that was held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on July 30, 2003. An estimated 450,000 and 500,000 people attended the concert, making it is the largest outdoor ticketed event in Canadian history and one of the largest events in North American history.

==Overview==

The concert was organized in about a month, upon the suggestion of headliners the Rolling Stones, who wanted to help revive Toronto&#x27;s economy after the SARS outbreaks earlier in the year. The Rolling Stones have held tour rehearsals in Toronto on more than one occasion; Toronto was also the setting for Keith Richards&#x27;s 1977 arrest and subsequent trial. When the Rolling Stones announced the concert, Toronto was still under a SARS warning from the World Health Organization. The publicity garnered by the SARS outbreak led to a downturn in Toronto&#x27;s tourism industry, which the concert was intended to help revive.

Tickets for the concert went on sale on June 27, 2003 and cost $21.50 Canadian. The Canadian portion of 150,000 tickets sold out almost immediately and made a single-day record for the Canadian arm of Ticketmaster. Tickets were also available for purchase at Metro Inc. grocery stores in Ontario.

The concert was held at Downsview Park in northern Toronto, a former military base which also accommodated 800,000 people when Pope John Paul II visited the city in 2002. The concert was hosted by actor/singer Dan Aykroyd, and vendors sold Alberta beef in support of the Canadian beef industry, which had recently suffered because of a case of mad cow disease. North York General Hospital, which had been hit the hardest by the SARS outbreak in previous months, provided emergency on-site hospital services. The Toronto water department was initially supposed to provide free water by tapping the groundwater at the site, but were unable to do so due to health concerns. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and cable music station MuchMoreMusic provided coverage of parts of the concert throughout the day, including the end of the Rolling Stones&#x27; set.

The concert opened in the afternoon with Have Love Will Travel Revue, including Aykroyd and James Belushi, Sam Roberts, Kathleen Edwards, La Chicane, The Tea Party, and The Flaming Lips who invited artists from backstage to dance on stage with them dressed in fuzzy animal costumes, Sass Jordan, The Isley Brothers, and Blue Rodeo. Each band performed for 15–20 minutes. The second part of the concert began later in the afternoon and lasted into the night and featured Justin Timberlake, The Guess Who, Rush, AC/DC, and the Rolling Stones, who performed a 90-minute set to end the concert.

Justin Timberlake was booed by the crowd, which was anticipating the harder-rocking second half of the concert. Throughout his performance, he had to dodge launched projectiles of water bottles, toilet paper, muffins, and other items thrown by the audience. He later returned to duet with Mick Jagger on &quot;Miss You&quot; and also for Justin Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;. When some fans continued to throw bottles at Timberlake, the crowd was harangued by a visibly angry Keith Richards.

Rush was the last band to be added to the lineup. According to drummer Neil Peart, &quot;When we were first asked to play Molson Canadian Rocks For Toronto, it seemed impossible to say yes. We had been off the road for 8 months, our gear was in the warehouse, most of our crew was out on other tours, and even we were all over the place - Geddy with his family in France, Alex working in the studio mixing our Rio de Janeiro show, and me on my motorcycle in the California mountains. However, when we thought about everything Toronto meant to our lives, to our work and play, our homes and families and friends, it seemed impossible to say no!&quot; 

A documentary DVD entitled &quot;Toronto Rocks&quot; was released in 2004, showing highlights of the event.

<text>Romance or romantic love is a feeling of love for, or a strong attraction towards another person, and the courtship behaviors undertaken by an individual to express those overall feelings and resultant emotions.

The &quot;Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Family Studies&quot; states that &quot;Romantic love, based on the model of mutual attraction and on a connection between two people that bonds them as a couple, creates the conditions for overturning the model of family and marriage that it engenders.&quot; This indicates that romantic love can be the founding of attraction between two people. This term was primarily used by the &quot;western countries after the 1800s were socialized into, love is the necessary prerequisite for starting an intimate relationship and represents the foundation on which to build the next steps in a family.&quot;

Alternatively, &quot;Collins Dictionary&quot; describes romantic love as &quot;an intensity and idealization of a love relationship, in which the other is imbued with extraordinary virtue, beauty, etc., so that the relationship overrides all other considerations, including material ones.&quot;

Although the emotions and sensations of &quot;romantic love&quot; are widely associated with sexual attraction, they could also exist without sexual attraction. In certain cases, romance could even be interpreted as a normal friendship. Historically, the term &quot;romance&quot; originates with the medieval ideal of chivalry as set out in the literature of chivalric romance.

People who experience little to no romantic attraction are referred to as aromantic.

== General definitions ==
Bode &amp; Kushnick undertook a comprehensive review of romantic love from a biological perspective in 2021. They considered the psychology of romantic love, its mechanisms, development across the lifespan, functions, and evolutionary history. Based on the content of that review, they proposed a biological definition of romantic love:

Romantic love is a motivational state typically associated with a desire for long-term mating with a particular individual. It occurs across the lifespan and is associated with distinctive cognitive, emotional, behavioral, social, genetic, neural, and endocrine activity in both sexes. Throughout much of the life course, it serves mate choice, courtship, sex, and pair-bonding functions. It is a suite of adaptations and by-products that arose sometime during the recent evolutionary history of humans.

Anthropologist Charles Lindholm defined love as &quot;any intense attraction that involves the idealization of the other, within an erotic context, with expectation of enduring sometime into the future&quot;.

=== Historical usage ===

The word &quot;romance&quot; comes from the French vernacular where initially it indicated a verse narrative. The word was originally an adverb of Latin origin, &quot;romanicus&quot;, meaning &quot;of the Roman style&quot;. European medieval vernacular tales, epics, and ballads generally dealt with chivalric adventure, not bringing in the concept of love until late into the seventeenth century. The word &quot;romance&quot; developed other meanings, such as the early nineteenth century Spanish and Italian definitions of &quot;adventurous&quot; and &quot;passionate&quot;, which could intimate both &quot;love affair&quot; and &quot;idealistic quality&quot;.
Anthropologists such as Claude Lévi-Strauss show that there were complex forms of courtship in ancient as well as contemporary primitive societies. There may not be evidence, however, that members of such societies formed loving relationships distinct from their established customs in a way that would parallel modern romance. Marriages were often arranged, but the wishes of those to be wed were considered, as affection was important to primitive tribes.

In the majority of primitive societies studied by the anthropologists, the extramarital and premarital relations between men and women were completely free. The members of the temporary couples were sexually attracted to each other more than to anyone else, but in all other respects their relationships had not demonstrated the characteristics of romantic love. In the book of Boris Shipov &quot;Theory of Romantic Love&quot; the corresponding evidences of anthropologists have been collected. Lewis H. Morgan: &quot;the passion of love was unknown among the barbarians. They are below the sentiment, which is the offspring of civilization and super added refinement of love was unknown among the barbarians.&quot; Margaret Mead: &quot;Romantic love as it occurs in our civilisation, inextricably bound up with ideas of monogamy, exclusiveness, jealousy and undeviating fidelity does not occur in Samoa.&quot; Bronislaw Malinowski: &quot;Though the social code does not favour romance, romantic elements and imaginative personal attachments are not altogether absent in Trobriand courtship and marriage.&quot;

The phenomenon which B. Malinowski calls love, actually has very little in common with the European love: &quot;Thus there is nothing roundabout in a Trobriand wooing; nor do they seek full personal relations, with sexual possession only as a consequence. Simply and directly a meeting is asked for with the avowed intention of sexual gratification. If the invitation is accepted, the satisfaction of the boy&#x27;s desire eliminates the romantic frame of mind, the craving for the unattainable and mysterious.&quot; &quot;an important point is that the pair&#x27;s community of interest is limited to the sexual relation only. The couple share a bed and nothing else. ... there are no services to be mutually rendered, they have no obligation to help each other in any way...&quot;

The aborigines of Mangaia island of Polynesia, who mastered the English language, used the word &quot;love&quot; with a completely different meaning as compared to that which is usual for the person brought up in the European culture. Donald S. Marshall: &quot;Mangaian informants and co-workers were quite interested in the European concept of &quot;love&quot;. English-speaking Mangaians had previously used the term only in a physical sense of sexual desire; to say, &quot;I love you&quot; in English to another person was tantamount to saying, &quot;I want to copulate with you.&quot; The components of affection and companionship, which may characterize the European use of the term, puzzled the Mangaians when we discussed the term.&quot; &quot;The principal findings that one can draw from an analysis of emotional components of sexual relationship feelings on Mangaia are:
# There is no cultural connection between a willingness to copulate with a person and any feeling of affection or liking or admiration between copulating partners.
# The degree of &quot;passion&quot; between two individuals in sexual relationships is not related to an emotional involvement but to degrees of instruction in, and use of, sexual techniques.&quot;

Nathaniel Branden claims that by virtue of &quot;the tribal mentality,&quot; &quot;in primitive cultures the idea of romantic love did not exist at all. Passionate individual attachments are evidently seen as threatening to tribal values and tribal authority.&quot; Dr. Audrey Richards, an anthropologist who lived among the Bemba of Northern Rhodesia in the 1930s, once related to a group of them an English folk-fable about a young prince who climbed glass mountains, crossed chasms, and fought dragons, all to obtain the hand of a maiden he loved. The Bemba were plainly bewildered, but remained silent. Finally an old chief spoke up, voicing the feelings of all present in the simplest of questions: &quot;Why not take another girl?&quot; he asked.

The earliest recorded marriages in Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, and among Hebrews were used to secure alliances and produce offspring. It was not until the Middle Ages that love began to be a real part of marriage. The marriages that did arise outside of arranged marriage were most often spontaneous relationships. In &quot;Ladies of the Leisure Class&quot;, Rutgers University professor Bonnie G. Smith depicts courtship and marriage rituals that may be viewed as oppressive to modern people. She writes, &quot;When the young women of the Nord married, they did so without illusions of love and romance. They acted within a framework of concern for the reproduction of bloodlines according to financial, professional, and sometimes political interests.&quot;

Anthony Giddens, in &quot;The Transformation of Intimacy: Sexuality, Love and Eroticism in Modern Society&quot;, states that romantic love introduced the idea of a narrative to an individual&#x27;s life, and telling a story is a root meaning of the term &quot;romance&quot;. According to Giddens, the rise of romantic love more or less coincided with the emergence of the novel. It was then that romantic love, associated with freedom and therefore the ideals of romantic love, created the ties between freedom and self-realization.

David R. Shumway states that &quot;the discourse of intimacy&quot; emerged in the last third of the 20th century, intended to explain how marriage and other relationships worked, and making the specific case that emotional closeness is much more important than passion, with intimacy and romance coexisting.

One example of the changes experienced in relationships in the early 21st century was explored by Giddens regarding homosexual relationships. According to Giddens, since homosexuals were not able to marry, they were forced to pioneer more open and negotiated relationships. These kinds of relationships then permeated the heterosexual population.

=== The origin of romantic love ===
Anthropologist and author Helen Fisher has argued that romantic love is a mammalian brain system evolved for selecting a preferred mating partner. Fisher&#x27;s team has proposed that romantic love may have evolved around the time of bipedalism, when new mothers needed additional protection and provision while having to carry their young. A 2023 paper by Adam Bode has argued that while Fisher&#x27;s evolutionary theory has been the predominant one for 25 years, romantic love could be better explained by evolutionary co-option of the systems for mother-infant bonding. Fisher likens romantic love to mammalian courtship attraction, but Bode argues courtship attraction is separate.

In F. Engels book, &quot;The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State&quot;: &quot;monogamy was the only known form of the family under which modern sex love could develop, it does not follow that this love developed, or even predominantly, within it as the mutual love of the spouses. The whole nature of strict monogamian marriage under male domination ruled this out.&quot; Sigmund Freud stated, &quot;It can easily be shown that the psychical value of erotic needs is reduced as soon as their satisfaction becomes easy. An obstacle is required in order to heighten libido; and where natural resistances to satisfaction have not been sufficient men have at all times erected conventional ones so as to be able to enjoy love. This is true both of individuals and of nations. In times in which there were no difficulties standing in the way of sexual satisfaction, such as perhaps during the decline of the ancient civilizations, love became worthless and life empty.&quot;

Some believe that romantic love evolved independently in multiple cultures. For example, in an article presented by Henry Grunebaum, he argues &quot;therapists mistakenly believe that romantic love is a phenomenon unique to Western cultures and first expressed by the troubadours of the Middle Ages.&quot;

=== Popularization of the term &quot;Romance&quot; ===
The word &quot;romance&quot; is derived from the Latin adverb , meaning &quot;in the vernacular,&quot; in reference to the languages Old French and Old Occitan. These languages were descendants of Latin, the language of the Romans. Evolutions of the word were used to refer first to the Romance languages and eventually also to the works composed in them. The genre of chivalric romance initially focused on the heroic military deeds of knights, which led to the use of the word &quot;romantic&quot; in the sense of &quot;chivalrous&quot;. As the genre evolved, starting after the Renaissance and especially in the Romantic period, it focused increasingly on love in the modern sense.

The general idea of &quot;romantic love&quot; in the Western tradition is believed to have originated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, primarily from that of the French culture. This idea is what has spurred the connection between the words &quot;romantic&quot; and &quot;lover&quot;, thus coining English phrases for romantic love such as &quot;loving like the Romans do&quot;. The precise origins of such a connection are unknown, however. Although the word &quot;romance&quot; or the equivalents thereof may not have the same connotation in other cultures, the general idea of &quot;romantic love&quot; appears to have crossed cultures and been accepted as a concept at one point in time or another.

=== Courtly love ===

The conception of romantic love was popularized in Western culture by the concept of courtly love. Knights of the Middle Ages were thought to have engaged in non-sexual relationships with women of nobility whom they served. These relations were highly elaborate and ritualized in a complexity that was steeped in a framework of tradition, which stemmed from theories of etiquette derived out of chivalry as a moral code of conduct.

Courtly love and the notion of domnei were often the subjects of troubadours, and could be typically found in artistic endeavors such as lyrical narratives and poetic prose of the time. Since marriage was commonly a formal arrangement, courtly love sometimes permitted expressions of emotional closeness that may have been lacking from the union between husband and wife. Courtly love did not necessarily refer to those engaging in sexual acts. It may also have referred to caring and emotional intimacy. The bond between a knight and his Lady, or the woman of typically high stature of whom he served, may in some cases have been one such example.

Religious meditations upon the Virgin Mary were partially responsible for the development of chivalry as an ethic and lifestyle. A lady&#x27;s honor and a knight&#x27;s devotion to her, coupled with an obligatory respect for all women, factored prominently in the identity of medieval knighthood. Members of the aristocracy were schooled in the principles of chivalry, which facilitated important changes in attitudes regarding the value of women.

Modern historians such as D. W. Robertson Jr., John C. Moore, and E. Talbot Donaldson consider the concept of courtly love to be a modern invention. Donaldson called it &quot;The Myth of Courtly Love,&quot; on the basis that it is not supported in medieval texts. Other scholars consider courtly love to have been purely a literary convention. Examples of allegorical use of the concept can be found in the Middle Ages, but there are no historical records that offer evidence of its presence in reality. Historian John Benton found no documentary evidence in law codes, court cases, chronicles or other historical documents.

== Types ==
Romantic love is contrasted with platonic love, which in all usages precludes sexual relations, yet only in the modern usage does it take on a fully nonsexual sense, rather than the classical sense, in which sexual drives are sublimated.

Unrequited love can be romantic in different ways: comic, tragic, or in the sense that sublimation itself is comparable to romance, where the spirituality of both art and egalitarian ideals is combined with strong character and emotions. Unrequited love is typical of the period of romanticism, but the term is distinct from any romance that might arise within it.

Romantic love may also be classified according to two categories, &quot;popular romance&quot; and &quot;divine or spiritual&quot; romance:

;Popular romance: Popular romance may include, but is not limited to the following types: idealistic, normal intense (such as the emotional aspect of &quot;falling in love&quot;), predictable as well as unpredictable, consuming (meaning consuming of time, energy and emotional withdrawals and bids), intense but out of control (such as the aspect of &quot;falling out of love&quot;) material and commercial (such as societal gain mentioned in a later section of this article), physical and sexual, and finally grand and demonstrative.
;Divine (or spiritual) romance: Divine (spiritual) romance may include, but is not limited to these following types: realistic, as well as plausible unrealistic, optimistic as well as pessimistic (depending upon the particular beliefs held by each person within the relationship.), abiding (e.g. the theory that each person had a predetermined stance as an agent of choice; such as &quot;choosing a husband&quot; or &quot;choosing a soul mate&quot;.), non-abiding (e.g. the theory that each person do not choose their actions, and therefore their romantic love involvement has been drawn from sources outside of themselves), predictable as well as unpredictable, self-control (such as obedience and sacrifice within the context of the relationship) or lack thereof (such as disobedience within the context of the relationship), emotional and personal, soulful (in the theory that the mind, soul, and body, are one connected entity), intimate, and infinite (such as the idea that love itself or the love of a God&#x27;s &quot;unconditional&quot; love is or could be everlasting).

== Philosophy ==
=== Plato ===
Greek philosophers and authors have had many theories of love. Some of these theories are presented in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;. Six Athenian friends, including Socrates, drink wine and each give a speech praising the deity Eros. When his turn comes, Aristophanes says in his mythical speech that sexual partners seek each other because they are descended from beings with spherical torsos, two sets of human limbs, genitalia on each side, and two faces back to back. Their three forms included the three permutations of pairs of gender (i.e. one masculine and masculine, another feminine and feminine, and the third masculine and feminine) and they were split by the gods to thwart the creatures&#x27; assault on heaven, recapitulated, according to the comic playwright, in other myths such as the Aloadae.

This story is relevant to modern romance partly because of the image of reciprocity it shows between the sexes. In the final speech before Alcibiades arrives, Socrates gives his encomium of love and desire as a lack of being, namely, the being or form of beauty.

=== René Girard ===
Though there are many theories of romantic love—such as that of Robert Sternberg, in which it is merely a mean combining liking and sexual desire—the major theories involve far more insight. For most of the 20th century, Freud&#x27;s theory of the family drama dominated theories of romance and sexual relationships. This gave rise to a few counter-theories. Theorists like Deleuze counter Freud and Jacques Lacan by attempting to return to a more naturalistic philosophy:

René Girard argues that romantic attraction is a product of jealousy and rivalry—particularly in a triangular form.

Girard, in any case, downplays romance&#x27;s individuality in favor of jealousy and the love triangle, arguing that romantic attraction arises primarily in the observed attraction between two others. A natural objection is that this is circular reasoning, but Girard means that a small measure of attraction reaches a critical point insofar as it is caught up in mimesis. Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot;, and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; are the best known examples of competitive-induced romance.

Girard&#x27;s theory of mimetic desire is controversial because of its alleged sexism. This view has to some extent supplanted its predecessor, Freudian Oedipal theory. It may find some spurious support in the supposed attraction of women to aggressive men. As a technique of attraction, often combined with irony, it is sometimes advised that one feign toughness and disinterest, but it can be a trivial or crude idea to promulgate to men, and it is not given with much understanding of mimetic desire in mind. Instead, cultivating a spirit of self-sacrifice, coupled with an attitude of appreciation or contemplation, directed towards the other of one&#x27;s attractions, constitutes the ideals of what we consider to be true romantic love. Mimesis is always the desire to possess, in renouncing it we offer ourselves as a sacrificial gift to the other.

Mimetic desire is often challenged by feminists, such as Toril Moi, who argue that it does not account for the woman as inherently desired.

Though the centrality of rivalry is not itself a cynical view, it does emphasize the mechanical in love relations. In that sense, it does resonate with capitalism and cynicism native to post-modernity. Romance in this context leans more on fashion and irony, though these were important for it in less emancipated times. Sexual revolutions have brought change to these areas. Wit or irony therefore encompass an instability of romance that is not entirely new but has a more central social role, fine-tuned to certain modern peculiarities and subversion originating in various social revolutions, culminating mostly in the 1960s.

=== Arthur Schopenhauer ===
The process of courtship also contributed to Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s pessimism, despite his own romantic success, and he argued that to be rid of the challenge of courtship would drive people to suicide with boredom. Schopenhauer theorized that individuals seek partners looking for a &quot;complement&quot; or completing of themselves in a partner, as in the cliché that &quot;opposites attract&quot;, but with the added consideration that both partners manifest this attraction for the sake of the species:

But what ultimately draws two individuals of different sex exclusively to each other with such power is the will-to-live which manifests itself in the whole species, and here anticipates, in the individual that these two can produce, an objectification of its true nature corresponding to its aims.
—&quot;World as Will and Representation&quot;, Volume 2, Chapter XLIV 

=== Other philosophers ===

Later modern philosophers such as La Rochefoucauld, David Hume and Jean-Jacques Rousseau also focused on morality, but desire was central to French thought and Hume himself tended to adopt a French worldview and temperament. Desire in this milieu meant a very general idea termed &quot;the passions&quot;, and this general interest was distinct from the contemporary idea of &quot;passionate&quot; now equated with &quot;romantic&quot;. Love was a central topic again in the subsequent movement of Romanticism, which focused on such things as absorption in nature and the absolute, as well as platonic and unrequited love in German philosophy and literature.

French philosopher Gilles Deleuze linked this concept of love as a lack mainly to Sigmund Freud, and Deleuze often criticized it.

=== American views of romantic love ===
Victor C. De Munck and David B. Kronenfeld conducted a study named &quot;Romantic Love in the United States: Applying Cultural Models Theory and Methods&quot;. This study was conducted through an investigation of two cultural model cases. It states that in America, &quot;we have a rather novel and dynamic cultural model that is falsifiable and predictive of successful love relationships&quot; Which supports that it is popular for American people to successfully share feelings of romanticism with each other&#x27;s partners. It describes American culture by stating: &quot;The model is unique in that it combines passion with comfort and friendship as properties of romantic love.&quot; One of its main contributions is advising the reader that &quot;For successful romantic love relations, a person would feel excited about meeting their beloved; make passionate and intimate love as opposed to only physical love; feel comfortable with the beloved, behaving in a companionable, friendly way with one&#x27;s partner; listen to the other&#x27;s concerns, offering to help out in various ways if necessary; and, all the while, keeping a mental ledger of the degree to which altruism and passion are mutual.&quot;

== Literature ==

Shakespeare and Søren Kierkegaard share a similar viewpoint that marriage and romance are not harmoniously &quot;in tune&quot; with each other. In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, for example, &quot;...there has not been, nor is there at this point, any display of affection between Isabella and the Duke, if by affection we mean something concerned with sexual attraction. The two at the end of the play love each other as they love virtue.&quot; In &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, in saying &quot;all combined, save what thou must combine By holy marriage&quot;, Romeo implies that it is not marriage with Juliet that he seeks but simply to be joined with her romantically.

Kierkegaard addressed these ideas in works such as &quot;Either/Or&quot; and &quot;Stages on Life&#x27;s Way&quot;:

In his 2008 book &quot;How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time&quot;, British writer Iain King tried to establish rules for romance applicable across most cultures. He concluded on six rules, including:
# Do not flirt with someone unless you mean it.
# Do not pursue people who you are not interested in, or who are not interested in you.
# In general, express your affection or uncertainty clearly, unless there is a special reason not to.

== Psychology ==

Many theorists attempt to analyze the process of romantic love.

Anthropologist Helen Fisher, in her book &quot;Why We Love&quot;, uses brain scans to show that love is the product of a chemical reaction in the brain. Norepinephrine and dopamine, among other brain chemicals, are responsible for excitement and bliss in humans as well as non-human animals. Fisher uses MRI to study the brain activity of a person &quot;in love&quot; and she concludes that love is a natural drive as powerful as hunger.

Psychologist Karen Horney in her article &quot;The Problem of the Monogamous Ideal&quot;, indicates that the overestimation of love leads to disillusionment; the desire to possess the partner results in the partner wanting to escape; and the friction against sex result in non-fulfillment. Disillusionment plus the desire to escape plus non-fulfillment result in a secret hostility, which causes the other partner to feel alienated. Secret hostility in one and secret alienation in the other cause the partners to secretly hate each other. This secret hate often leads one or the other or both to seek love objects outside the marriage or relationship.

Psychologist Harold Bessell in his book &quot;The Love Test&quot;, reconciles the opposing forces noted by the above researchers and shows that there are two factors that determine the quality of a relationship. Bessell proposes that people are drawn together by a force he calls &quot;romantic attraction&quot;, which is a combination of genetic and cultural factors. This force may be weak or strong and may be felt to different degrees by each of the two love partners. The other factor is &quot;emotional maturity&quot;, which is the degree to which a person is capable of providing good treatment in a love relationship. It can thus be said that an immature person is more likely to overestimate love, become disillusioned, and have an affair whereas a mature person is more likely to see the relationship in realistic terms and act constructively to work out problems.

Romantic love, in the abstract sense of the term, is traditionally considered to involve a mix of emotional and sexual desire for another as a person. However, Lisa M. Diamond, a University of Utah psychology professor, proposes that sexual desire and romantic love are functionally independent and that romantic love is not intrinsically oriented to same-gender or other-gender partners. She also proposes that the links between love and desire are bidirectional as opposed to unilateral. Furthermore, Diamond does not state that one&#x27;s sex has priority over another sex (a male or female) in romantic love because her theory suggests it is as possible for someone who is homosexual to fall in love with someone of the other gender as for someone who is heterosexual to fall in love with someone of the same gender. In her 2012 review of this topic, Diamond emphasized that what is true for men may not be true for women. According to Diamond, in most men sexual orientation is fixed and most likely innate, but in many women sexual orientation may vary from 0 to 6 on the Kinsey scale and back again.

Martie Haselton, a psychologist at UCLA, considers romantic love a &quot;commitment device&quot; or mechanism that encourages two humans to form a lasting bond. She has explored the evolutionary rationale that has shaped modern romantic love and has concluded that long-lasting relationships are helpful to ensure that children reach reproductive age and are fed and cared for by two parents. Haselton and her colleagues have found evidence in their experiments that suggest love&#x27;s adaptation. The first part of the experiments consists of having people think about how much they love someone and then suppress thoughts of other attractive people. In the second part of the experiment the same people are asked to think about how much they sexually desire those same partners and then try to suppress thoughts about others. The results showed that love is more efficient in pushing out those rivals than sex.

Research by the University of Pavia suggests that romantic love lasts for about a year (similar to limerence) before being replaced by a more stable, non-passionate &quot;companionate love&quot;. In companionate love, changes occur from the early stage of love to when the relationship becomes more established and romantic feelings seem to end. However, research from Stony Brook University in New York suggests that some couples keep romantic feelings alive for much longer.

===Attachment patterns===

Attachment styles that people develop as children can influence the way that they interact with partners in adult relationships, with secure attachment styles being associated with healthier and more trusting relationships than avoidant or anxious attachment styles. Hazen and Shaver found that adult romantic attachment styles were similar to the categories of secure, avoidant, and anxious that had previously been studied in children&#x27;s attachments to their caregivers, demonstrating that attachment styles are stable across the lifespan. Later on, researchers distinguished between dismissive avoidant attachment and fearful avoidant attachment. Others have found that secure adult attachment, leading to the ability for intimacy and confidence in relationship stability, is characterized by low attachment-related anxiety and avoidance, while the fearful style is high on both dimensions, the dismissing style is low on anxiety and high on avoidance, and the preoccupied style is high on anxiety and low on avoidance.

=== Romantic love definition/operationalization ===
Irving Singer first defined love based on four Greek terms: &quot;eros&quot;, meaning the search for beauty; &quot;philia&quot;, the feelings of affection in close friendships, &quot;nomos&quot;, the submission of and obedience to higher or divine powers, and &quot;agape&quot;, the bestowal of love and affection for the divine powers. While Singer did believe that love was important to world culture, he did not believe that romantic love played a major role. However, Susan Hendrick and Clyde Hendrick at Texas Tech University have theorized that romantic love will play an increasingly important cultural role in the future, as it is considered an important part of living a fulfilling life. They also theorized that love in long-term romantic relationships has only been the product of cultural forces that came to fruition within the past 300 years. By cultural forces, they mean the increasing prevalence of individualistic ideologies, which are the result of an inward shift of many cultural worldviews.

=== Passionate and companionate love ===
Researchers have determined that romantic love is a complex emotion that can be divided into either passionate or companionate forms. Berscheid and Walster and Hatfield found that these two forms can co-exist, either simultaneously or intermittently. Passionate love is an arousal-driven emotion that often gives people extreme feelings of happiness, and can also give people feelings of anguish. Companionate love is a form that creates a steadfast bond between two people, and gives people feelings of peace. Researchers have described the stage of passionate love as &quot;being on cocaine&quot;, since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, as when cocaine is being used. It is also estimated that passionate love (as with limerence) lasts for about twelve to eighteen months.

Hendrick and Hendrick studied college students who were in the early stages of a relationship and found that almost half reported that their significant other was their closest friend, providing evidence that both passionate and companionate love exist in new relationships. Conversely, in a study of long-term marriages, Contreras, Hendrick, and Hendrick found that couples endorsed measures of both companionate love and passionate love and that passionate love was the strongest predictor of marital satisfaction, showing that both types of love can endure throughout the years.

=== The triangular theory of love ===
Psychologist Robert Sternberg developed the triangular theory of love. He theorized that love is a combination of three main components: passion (physical arousal); intimacy (psychological feelings of closeness); and commitment (the sustaining of a relationship). He also theorized that the different combinations of these three components could yield up to seven different forms of love. These include popularized forms such as romantic love (intimacy and passion) and consummate love (passion, intimacy, and commitment). The other forms are liking (intimacy), companionate love (intimacy and commitment), empty love (commitment), fatuous love (passion and commitment), and infatuation (passion).
Studies on Sternberg&#x27;s theory love found that intimacy most strongly predicted marital satisfaction in married couples, with passion also being an important predictor (Silberman, 1995. On the other hand, Acker and Davis found that commitment was the strongest predictor of relationship satisfaction, especially for long-term relationships.

=== The self-expansion theory of romantic love ===
Researchers Arthur and Elaine Aron theorized that humans have a basic drive to expand their self-concepts. Further, their experience with Eastern concepts of love caused them to believe that positive emotions, cognitions, and relationships in romantic behaviors all drive the expansion of a person&#x27;s self-concept. A study following college students for 10 weeks showed that those students who fell in love over the course of the investigation reported higher feelings of self-esteem and self-efficacy than those who did not.

=== Mindful relationships ===
Gottman studies the components of a flourishing romantic relationship have been studied in the lab Gottman &amp; Silver, 1999. He used physiological and behavioral measures during couples&#x27; interactions to predict relationship success and found that five positive interactions to one negative interaction are needed to maintain a healthy relationship. He established a therapy intervention for couples that focused on civil forms of disapproval, a culture of appreciation, acceptance of responsibility for problems, and self-soothing. 

=== Relationship behaviors ===
Recent research suggests that romantic relationships impact daily behaviors and people are influenced by the eating habits of their romantic partners. Specifically, in the early stages of romantic relationships, women are more likely to be influenced by the eating patterns (i.e., healthiness/unhealthiness) of men. However, when romantic relationships are established, men are influenced by the eating patterns of women.

=== Relationship maintenance ===
Daniel Canary from the International Encyclopedia of Marriage describes relationship maintenance as &quot;At the most basic level, relational maintenance refers to a variety of behaviors used by partners in an effort to stay together.&quot; Maintaining stability and quality in a relationship is the key to success in a romantic relationship. He says that: &quot;simply staying together is not sufficient; instead, the quality of the relationship is important. For researchers, this means examining behaviors that are linked to relational satisfaction and other indicators of quality.&quot; Canary suggests using the work of John Gottman, an American physiologist best known for his research on marital stability for over four decades, serves as a guide for predicting outcomes in relationships because &quot;Gottman emphasizes behaviors that determine whether or not a couple gets divorced&quot;.

Furthermore, Canary also uses the source from Stafford and Canary, a journal on Communication Monographs, because they created five great strategies based on maintaining quality in a relationship, the article&#x27;s strategies are to provide:
* &quot;Positivity&quot;: being joyful and optimistic, not criticizing each other.
* &quot;Assurances&quot;: proving one&#x27;s commitment and love.
* &quot;Openness&quot;: to be honest with one another according to what they want in the relationship.
* &quot;Social networks&quot;: efforts into involving friends and family in their activities.
* &quot;Sharing tasks&quot;: complementing each other&#x27;s needs based on daily work.

On relational maintenance, Steven McCornack and Joseph Ortiz, the authors of the book &quot;Choices &amp; Connection&quot;, state that relationship maintenance &quot;refers to the use of communication behaviors to keep a relationship strong and to ensure that each party continues to draw satisfaction from the relationship&quot;.

====Physiology====
Researchers such as Feeney and Noller question the stability of attachment style across the life span since studies that measured attachment styles at time points ranging from two weeks to eight months found that one out of four adults&#x27; attachment style changed. Furthermore, a study by Lopez and Gormley found that attachment styles could change during the first year of college and that changes to more secure attachment styles were associated with adjustments in self-confidence ratings and coping styles. On the other hand, attachment styles in childhood mirror the ones found in adult romantic relationships. In addition, research has shown that building interpersonal connections strengthens neural regulatory systems that are involved in emotions of empathy, enjoyment of positive social events, and stress management, providing evidence that early social interactions affect adult relationships.

Another topic of controversy in the field of romantic relationships is that of domestic abuse. Following the theory that romantic love evolved as a byproduct of survival, it can be said that in some instances, it has turned into a maladaptation. Oxytocin (OT) is a neurophysical hormone produced in the brain. It is known to cause a decrease in stress response. It also can cause an increase in feelings of attachment. In the beginning stages of a romantic relationship, OT levels surge and then remain relatively stable over the duration of the relationship. The higher the surge of OT, the greater the likelihood is of partners staying together. It plays an important role in increasing positive interpersonal behaviors such as trust, altruism, empathy, etc. This response is not universal and can in fact, cause the opposite to occur depending on environment and individual. Individuals ranked high in rejection sensitivity exhibited aggressive tendencies and decreased willingness for cooperation, indicating a link between oxytocin and relationship maintenance.

The feelings associated with romantic love function to ensure the greater reproductive fitness of individuals. The obligations of individuals in romantic relationships to preserve these bonds are based in kin selection theory, where by exhibiting aggressive behavior, a mate can use intimidation and dominance to ward off other potential predators, thus protecting the pair bond and their actual or potential offspring. This has however evolved to the point where it has become detrimental to the fitness of individuals; what is causing attachment to occur in a relationship, is now causing one partner to harm the other.

In the search for the root of intimate partner violence (IPV), intranasal oxytocin was administered to a control group and a group of participants with aggressive tendencies. Participants were then surveyed on how willing they were to engage in five behaviors towards their romantic partner. What they found was that oxytocin increased IPV inclinations only among the participants with a predisposition towards aggressive tendencies.

<text>Transpower New Zealand Limited (TPNZ) is the state-owned enterprise responsible for electric power transmission in New Zealand. It performs two major functions in the New Zealand electricity market. As the owner of the National Grid it provides the infrastructure of electric power transmission that allows consumers to have access to generation from a wide range of sources, and enables competition in the wholesale electricity market; as system operator it manages the real-time operation of the grid and the physical operation of the electricity market.

Transpower was initially formed as an operating division of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ) in 1987. In 1994 it was separated from ECNZ and corporatised to become a state-owned enterprise with its own board of directors and ministerial shareholders, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises. The New Zealand Treasury&#x27;s Commercial Operations group (formerly the Crown Ownership Monitoring Unit) monitors the performance of Transpower on behalf of the shareholding ministers.

==Role of the National Grid==
The New Zealand national grid provides the means of transporting bulk electricity from where it is generated (by companies like Meridian Energy and Mercury Energy) to cities, towns and some major industrial users like the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter.
Most of the electricity from the national grid is delivered to New Zealand&#x27;s homes and businesses by electricity distribution companies like Vector and Orion. A few large industrial users are directly connected to the national grid.

Transpower owns and operates of transmission lines. A core network consisting of (route) of 220 kV transmission lines exist in each island (one line is built to 400 kV but operates at 220 kV), and this is supplemented by of 110 kV transmission lines and of 66 kV and 50 kV transmission lines, which interconnect the core grid to smaller load centres and power stations. Transpower also owns and operates the HVDC Inter-Island, a ±350 kV high-voltage direct current link between the two islands. There are 178 electrical substations, containing 1116 transformers with a total capacity of 14,500 MVA.

==Regulation under the Commerce Act==
The revenue that Transpower receives for the provision of the transmission service is regulated by the Commerce Commission, under Part IV of the Commerce Act. The type of regulation is individual price-quality path (IPP) regulation, and came into effect on 1 April 2011. The individual price-quality path governs Transpower&#x27;s revenues for each pricing year, with the paths being reset either every four or five years. Quality targets for the transmission service are also reviewed and monitored in the regulatory process.

==Role of the system operator==

The role of the system operator is to manage the security of the power system in real time and co-ordinate the supply of and demand for electricity, in a manner that avoids fluctuations in frequency or interruptions of supply. 
The system operator is required to maintain a continuous (second-by-second) balance between electricity supply from power stations and demand from consumers, and also ensure the provision of reserves that will allow for sudden contingencies. The system operator achieves this by determining the optimal combination of generating stations and reserve providers for each market trading period, instructing generators when and how much electricity to generate, and managing any contingent events that cause the balance between supply and demand to be disrupted. System operations staff undertake this work using sophisticated energy modelling and communications systems.
In addition to its roles of real-time dispatch of generation and managing security, the system operator also carries out investigations and planning to ensure that supply can meet demand and system security can be maintained during future trading periods. Examples of planning work may include co-ordinating generator and transmission outages, facilitating commissioning of new generating plant and procuring ancillary services to support power system operation.

The system operator service is provided and funded under an agreement with the Electricity Authority.

<doc id="285150" wikidata="Q6819305" url="?curid=285150" title="Meridian Energy">
<text>Meridian Energy Limited is a New Zealand electricity generator and retailer. The company generates the largest proportion of New Zealand&#x27;s electricity, generating 35 percent of the country&#x27;s electricity in the year ending December 2014, and is the fourth largest retailer, with 14 percent of market share in terms of customers as of December 2015.

Meridian was one of three electricity companies formed from the break-up of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ) in 1998–99, taking over the Waitaki River and the Manapouri hydro schemes. Originally a state-owned enterprise wholly owned by the New Zealand Government, the company was partially privatised in October 2013 by the Fifth National Government, with the government retaining a 51.02% shareholding.

Today, Meridian operates seven hydroelectric power stations and one wind farm in the South Island of New Zealand, and four wind farms in the North Island.

== History ==
Meridian originated from the break-up of the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand (ECNZ) in 1999 as a result of the reforms of the New Zealand Electricity Market. Meridian&#x27;s share of ECNZ was corporatised as a state-owned enterprise with its own board of directors and with two Ministerial shareholders: the Minister of Finance and the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises. In 2013 it was partially privatised by the fifth National Government of New Zealand.

As part of reforms, local electricity companies were split into lines and retail and the retail portion sold off. Meridian initially acquired the retail base of Northpower, Centralines, Scanpower, and Network Waitaki, and later acquired Orion&#x27;s retail base from NGC.

* 2001 – Meridian purchased five mini hydro-power stations in Australia. These stations linked with dams used primarily for irrigation, and have a total generating capacity of 62 MW.
* September 2001 – Meridian purchased the South Island customer-base of Natural Gas Corporation (NGC), at the time New Zealand&#x27;s largest electricity retailer. The purchase came towards the end of an exceptionally dry autumn. Low hydro-levels had driven the wholesale market spot prices to very high levels. NGC had purchased the customer-base when Canada&#x27;s TransAlta quit New Zealand. NGC re-branded itself as OnEnergy to escape the poor reputation of the &quot;TransAlta&quot; brand. OnEnergy found itself with insufficient generation capacity to stand the high winter market prices and had made the critical mistake of not purchasing any hedge contracts. It attempted to raise its retail prices, but its customers then flocked to other retailers. Finally, after suffering huge losses, NGC had perforce to quit the retail sector, selling its customer-base to two of the Government&#x27;s companies: Meridian and Genesis Energy. At that point, the New Zealand electricity market became further vertically integrated, and many have come to believe that this adversely affected competition in the retail electricity market.
* April 2003 – Meridian extended its operations in Australia with the purchase of &quot;Southern Hydro&quot;, increasing its Australian generating capacity by 540 MW.
* Southern Hemisphere Winter 2003 – Low hydro inflows and storage levels again resulted in exceptional wholesale market spot prices. As a consequence, the retailers TrustPower and Freshstart abandoned market areas where they had no generation. This strengthened Meridian&#x27;s dominance of the South Island customer-base.
* 29 March 2004 – Meridian cancelled Project Aqua, a controversial 524 MW power scheme for six dams and a man-made canal on the Lower Waitaki River in North Otago. The scheme allegedly represented the last opportunity for large-scale hydroelectric development of this magnitude in New Zealand. Abandoning the venture cost Meridian NZ$38.7 million. – Meridian stopped the scheme because of uncertainty over rights to use the water, growing costs, and the difficulties and uncertainties with obtaining consents under the Resource Management Act legislation. In July 2004, Meridian announced an independent audit of the abandoned scheme.
* 9 December 2004 – then Prime Minister Helen Clark officially opened the Te Āpiti Wind Farm – Meridian&#x27;s first wind farm.
* 2 June 2005 – Meridian announced a proposal to develop a wind farm west of Wellington, Project West Wind with up to 70 wind turbines with a total capacity of 210 MW, built across 55.8 square km on rural land near Mākara at the south-western tip of the North Island. A local pressure group, the Makara Guardians, opposed the scheme. Successful application for resource consent for the project was announced on 21 December 2005. The consent was subsequently appealed and upheld in May 2007.
* 30 November 2005 – Meridian completed the sale of its Australian operation, &quot;Southern Hydro&quot;, for A$1.42 billion (NZ$1.52 billion) to Australian Gas Light Company. Meridian had steadily expanded and upgraded its assets in Australia since purchase, including commissioning a 91 MW wind-farm. The sale commanded a hefty premium, driven by new demand for renewable energy-generation because of mandatory Australian requirements that electricity retailers sell a proportion of renewable energy.
* 8 June 2007 – The White Hill Wind Farm is officially opened.
* 29 April 2009 – Prime Minister John Key officially turns on the first 15 turbines on the West Wind wind farm.
* 1 June 2011 – The sale of Meridian Energy&#x27;s Tekapo A and Tekapo B hydroelectric power stations to Genesis Energy took effect. The sale was part of a package of government reforms aimed at improving the electricity sector.

* 30 September 2013 – 49 percent of shares in the company officially offered for sale at between $1.50 and $1.80

==Power stations==

Meridian Energy owns and operates seven hydroelectric power stations in the South Island – six on the Waitaki River and at Manapouri. It also owns and operates five wind farms in New Zealand, and a single turbine in Brooklyn, Wellington. In total, Meridian has a total installed capacity of 2,754 MW in New Zealand and 201 MW overseas.


===Proposed===
Projects being developed by Meridian Energy include the following.

===Cancelled===
== Sustainability ==

=== Carbon Footprint ===
In 2006, Greenpeace judged Meridian as the only &quot;green&quot; electricity company in New Zealand. In 2007, Meridian announced that it had received CarboNZero certification from Landcare Research confirming that the generation and retailing of its electricity was carbon neutral.

In 2008, Meridian issued and sold the first carbon credits issued and sold under the JI program of the Kyoto Protocol.

In June 2008, National&#x27;s Climate Change spokesman Nick Smith complained to the Commerce Commission that Meridian&#x27;s claim of carbon neutrality in its advertising was misleading as Smith considered that Meridian had to buy thermally generated power during dry years to supply its customers. A spokesman for Meridian said they stood by the validity of the certification of their carbon-neutral status. In July 2009, the Commerce Commission concluded that Meridian&#x27;s statements of carbon neutrality were not misleading.

=== Electric Vehicles and Charging Programme ===
In 2015 Meridian began converting its business fleet to electric vehicles in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. In early 2019 Meridian joined the EV100 initiative, it has committed to its light passenger vehicle business fleet becoming 100% electric by 2030. In August 2019 the company won the Deloitte Energy Award for a Low Carbon Initiative for its work on electric business fleet conversion.

=== Kākāpō Recovery Programme ===
Meridian Energy are National Partners of the Department of Conservation Kākāpō Recovery Programme since 2016. Kākāpō are an endangered New Zealand native parrot. The involvement helps fund research and initiatives relating to genetics, nutrition, disease management and finding new sites. Meridian staff are also involved through providing electrical support and volunteers to the remote pest-free islands the kākāpō are surviving on.

=== Project River Recovery ===
In 1990 Meridian established Project River Recovery, recognising the impacts of hydroelectric development from the 1930s to the 1980s on the Waitaki&#x27;s braided rivers and wetlands. Project River Recovery&#x27;s work is run by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and includes intensive weed control, predator control, construction of wetlands, and research and monitoring programmes. When Tekapo A and Tekapo B were sold to Genesis Energy in 2011, the electricity company joined the compensatory funding agreement.

=== Waiau River Recovery ===
In 1996 the Waiau Fisheries and Wildlife Enhancement Trust was formed to mitigate and improve the Waiau River from impacts by the Manapouri Hydro Station. The trust was established in partnership with the Waiau Working Party and ECNZ (now Meridian Energy Limited). The area covered is from Te Wae Wae Bay in the south to Lake Te Anau in the north. The work focuses on enhancing wetlands, waterways and riparian plantings.

== Community ==

=== Wellington Wind Sculpture Walkway ===
Wellington, New Zealand&#x27;s capital city, is well known for wind and the Meridian Energy Wind Sculpture walkway celebrates this. In 2007 the four sculptures won Best Public Art and the final piece was opened in May 2010. The five sculptures are the &#x27;&quot;Zephyrometer&#x27;&quot; by Phil Price, &#x27;&quot;Urban Forest&#x27;&quot; by Leon van den Eijkel (in collaboration with Allan Brown), &#x27;&quot;Akau Tangi&#x27;&quot; by Phil Dadson, &#x27;&quot;Tower of Light&quot;&#x27; by Andrew Drummond and &quot;&#x27;Pacific Grass&quot;&#x27; by Kon Dimopoulos. The sculptures are managed by the Wellington Sculpture Trust 

=== KidsCan ===
In 2013 Meridian became the principle partner of the KidsCan Charity. In April 2019 the company committed to a further three years of support, helping provide lunches, raincoats, shoes and warm clothing to kids in need.

=== Power Up Community Fund ===
Meridian supports communities near its generation assets through the Power Up fund. This includes promoting conservation, community and educational efforts in seven communities around New Zealand.

== Controversy ==
In 2019, Meridian was found to mislead consumers when they implied the electricity they retailed was 100% renewable after a complaint was brought to the Advertising Standards Authority by rival retailer Electric Kiwi. Additionally, Meridian Energy was found to have pushed up power prices in December 2019 by unnecessarily spilling water from its South Island dams that could have been used for generation, according to a preliminary ruling from New Zealand&#x27;s Electricity Authority.

<text>The pineal gland (also known as the pineal body or epiphysis cerebri) is a small endocrine gland in the brain of most vertebrates. It produces melatonin, a serotonin-derived hormone, which modulates sleep patterns following the diurnal cycles. The shape of the gland resembles a pine cone, which gives it its name. The pineal gland is located in the epithalamus, near the center of the brain, between the two hemispheres, tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join. It is one of the neuroendocrine secretory circumventricular organs in which capillaries are mostly permeable to solutes in the blood.

The pineal gland is present in almost all vertebrates, but is absent in protochordates in which there is a simple pineal homologue. The hagfish, archaic vertebrates, lack a pineal gland. In some species of amphibians and reptiles, the gland is linked to a light-sensing organ, variously called the parietal eye, the pineal eye or the third eye&quot;.&quot; Reconstruction of the biological evolution pattern suggests that the pineal gland was originally a kind of atrophied photoreceptor that developed into a neuroendocrine organ.

Ancient Greeks were the first to notice the pineal gland and believed it to be a valve, a guardian for the flow of pneuma. Galen in the 2nd century C.E. could not find any functional role and regarded the gland as a structural support for the brain tissue. He gave the name &quot;konario,&quot; meaning cone or pinecone, which during Renaissance was translated to Latin as &quot;pinealis.&quot; The 17th century philosopher René Descartes regarded the gland as having a mystical purpose, describing it as the &quot;principal seat of the soul&quot;. In the mid-20th century, the biological role as a neuroendocrine organ was established.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pineal&quot;, from Latin &quot;pinea&quot; (pine-cone) in reference to the gland&#x27;s similar shape, was first used in the late 17th century.

== Structure ==
The pineal gland is a pine cone-shaped (hence the name), unpaired midline brain structure. It is reddish-gray in colour and about the size of a grain of rice (5–8 mm) in humans. It forms part of the epithalamus. It is attached to the rest of the brain by a pineal stalk. The ventral lamina of the pineal stalk is continuous with the posterior commissure, and its dorsal lamina with the habenular commissure.

=== Location ===
It normally lies in a depression between the two superior colliculi. It is situated between the laterally positioned thalamic bodies, and posterior to the habenular commissure. It is located in the quadrigeminal cistern. It is located posterior to the third ventricle and encloses the small, cerebrospinal fluid-filled pineal recess of the third ventricle which projects into the stalk of the gland.

===Blood supply===
Unlike most of the mammalian brain, the pineal gland is not isolated from the body by the blood–brain barrier system; it has profuse blood flow, second only to the kidney, supplied from the choroidal branches of the posterior cerebral artery.

===Afferents===
The afferent nerve supply of pineal gland is by the nervus conarii which receives postganglionic sympathetic afferents from the superior cervical ganglion, and parasympathetic afferents from the pterygopalatine ganglia and otic ganglia. According to research on animals, neurons of the trigeminal ganglion that are involved in pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide neuropeptide signaling project the gland.

===Neural pathway for melatonin production===

The canonical neural pathway regulating pineal melatonin production begins in the eye with the intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells of the retina which project inhibitory GABAergic efferents to the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus via the retinohypothalamic tract. The paraventricular nucleus in turn projects to the superior cervical ganglia, which finally projects to the pineal gland. Darkness thus leads to disinhibition of the paraventricular nucleus, leading it to activate pineal gland melatonin production by way of the superior cervical ganglia.

===Microanatomy===

The pineal body in humans consists of a lobular parenchyma of pinealocytes surrounded by connective tissue spaces. The gland&#x27;s surface is covered by a pial capsule.

The pineal gland consists mainly of pinealocytes, but four other cell types have been identified. As it is quite cellular (in relation to the cortex and white matter), it may be mistaken for a neoplasm.

===Development===
The human pineal gland grows in size until about 1–2 years of age, remaining stable thereafter, although its weight increases gradually from puberty onwards. The abundant melatonin levels in children are believed to inhibit sexual development, and pineal tumors have been linked with precocious puberty. When puberty arrives, melatonin production is reduced.

===Symmetry===
In the zebrafish the pineal gland does not straddle the midline, but shows a left-sided bias. In humans, functional cerebral dominance is accompanied by subtle anatomical asymmetry.

== Function ==
One function of the pineal gland is to produce melatonin. Melatonin has various functions in the central nervous system, the most important of which is to help modulate sleep patterns. Melatonin production is stimulated by darkness and inhibited by light. Light sensitive nerve cells in the retina detect light and send this signal to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), synchronizing the SCN to the day-night cycle. Nerve fibers then relay the daylight information from the SCN to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN), then to the spinal cord and via the sympathetic system to superior cervical ganglia (SCG), and from there into the pineal gland.

The compound pinoline is also claimed to be produced in the pineal gland; it is one of the beta-carbolines. This claim is subject to some controversy.

===Regulation of the pituitary gland===
Studies on rodents suggest that the pineal gland influences the pituitary gland&#x27;s secretion of the sex hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH). Pinealectomy performed on rodents produced no change in pituitary weight, but caused an increase in the concentration of FSH and LH within the gland. Administration of melatonin did not return the concentrations of FSH to normal levels, suggesting that the pineal gland influences pituitary gland secretion of FSH and LH through an undescribed transmitting molecule.

The pineal gland contains receptors for the regulatory neuropeptide, endothelin-1, which, when injected in picomolar quantities into the lateral cerebral ventricle, causes a calcium-mediated increase in pineal glucose metabolism.

===Regulation of bone metabolism===
Studies in mice suggest that the pineal-derived melatonin regulates new bone deposition. Pineal-derived melatonin mediates its action on the bone cells through MT2 receptors. This pathway could be a potential new target for osteoporosis treatment as the study shows the curative effect of oral melatonin treatment in a postmenopausal osteoporosis mouse model.

==Clinical significance==
===Calcification===
Calcification of the pineal gland is typical in young adults, and has been observed in children as young as two years of age. The internal secretions of the pineal gland are known to inhibit the development of the reproductive glands because when it is severely damaged in children, development of the sexual organs and the skeleton are accelerated. Pineal gland calcification is detrimental to its ability to synthesize melatonin and scientific literature presents inconclusive findings on whether it causes sleep problems.

The calcified gland is often seen in skull X-rays. Calcification rates vary widely by country and correlate with an increase in age, with calcification occurring in an estimated 40% of Americans by age seventeen. Calcification of the pineal gland is associated with corpora arenacea, also known as &quot;brain sand&quot;.

===Tumors===
Tumors of the pineal gland are called pinealomas. These tumors are rare and 50% to 70% are germinomas that arise from sequestered embryonic germ cells. Histologically they are similar to testicular seminomas and ovarian dysgerminomas.

A pineal tumor can compress the superior colliculi and pretectal area of the dorsal midbrain, producing Parinaud&#x27;s syndrome. Pineal tumors also can cause compression of the cerebral aqueduct, resulting in a noncommunicating hydrocephalus. Other manifestations are the consequence of their pressure effects and consist of visual disturbances, headache, mental deterioration, and sometimes dementia-like behaviour.

These neoplasms are divided into three categories: pineoblastomas, pineocytomas, and mixed tumors, based on their level of differentiation, which, in turn, correlates with their neoplastic aggressiveness. The clinical course of patients with pineocytomas is prolonged, averaging up to several years. The position of these tumors makes them difficult to remove surgically.

=== Other conditions ===
The morphology of the pineal gland differs markedly in different pathological conditions. For instance, it is known that its volume is reduced in both obese patients and those with primary insomnia.

==Other animals==
Nearly all vertebrate species possess a pineal gland. The most important exception is a primitive vertebrate, the hagfish. Even in the hagfish, however, there may be a &quot;pineal equivalent&quot; structure in the dorsal diencephalon. A few more complex vertebrates have lost pineal glands over the course of their evolution. The lamprey (another primitive vertebrate), however, does possess one. The lancelet &quot;Branchiostoma lanceolatum&quot;, an early chordate which is a close relative to vertebrates, also lacks a recognizable pineal gland. Protochordates in general do not have the distinct structure as an organ, but they have a mass of photoreceptor cells called lamellar body, which is regarded as a pineal homologue.

The results of various scientific research in evolutionary biology, comparative neuroanatomy and neurophysiology have explained the evolutionary history (phylogeny) of the pineal gland in different vertebrate species. From the point of view of biological evolution, the pineal gland is a kind of atrophied photoreceptor. In the epithalamus of some species of amphibians and reptiles, it is linked to a light-sensing organ, known as the parietal eye, which is also called the pineal eye or &quot;third eye.&quot; It is likely that the common ancestor of all vertebrates had a pair of photosensory organs on the top of its head, similar to the arrangement in modern lampreys. In many lower vertebrates (such as species of fish, amphibians and lizards), the pineal gland is associated with parietal or pineal eye. In these animals, the parietal eye acts as a photoreceptor, and hence are also known as the third eye, and they can be seen on top of the head in some species. Some extinct Devonian fishes have two parietal foramina in their skulls, suggesting an ancestral bilaterality of parietal eyes. The parietal eye and the pineal gland of living tetrapods are probably the descendants of the left and right parts of this organ, respectively.

During embryonic development, the parietal eye and the pineal organ of modern lizards and tuataras form together from a pocket formed in the brain ectoderm. The loss of parietal eyes in many living tetrapods is supported by developmental formation of a paired structure that subsequently fuses into a single pineal gland in developing embryos of turtles, snakes, birds, and mammals.

The pineal organs of mammals fall into one of three categories based on shape. Rodents have more structurally complex pineal glands than other mammals.

Crocodilians and some tropical lineages of mammals (some xenarthrans (sloths), pangolins, sirenians (manatees and dugongs), and some marsupials (sugar gliders)) have lost both their parietal eye and their pineal organ. Polar mammals, such as walruses and some seals, possess unusually large pineal glands.

All amphibians have a pineal organ, but some frogs and toads also have what is called a &quot;frontal organ&quot;, which is essentially a parietal eye.

Pinealocytes in many non-mammalian vertebrates have a strong resemblance to the photoreceptor cells of the eye. Evidence from morphology and developmental biology suggests that pineal cells possess a common evolutionary ancestor with retinal cells.

Pineal cytostructure seems to have evolutionary similarities to the retinal cells of the lateral eyes. Modern birds and reptiles express the phototransducing pigment melanopsin in the pineal gland. Avian pineal glands are thought to act like the suprachiasmatic nucleus in mammals. The structure of the pineal eye in modern lizards and tuatara is analogous to the cornea, lens, and retina of the lateral eyes of vertebrates.

In most vertebrates, exposure to light sets off a chain reaction of enzymatic events within the pineal gland that regulates circadian rhythms. In humans and other mammals, the light signals necessary to set circadian rhythms are sent from the eye through the retinohypothalamic system to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and the pineal gland.

The fossilized skulls of many extinct vertebrates have a pineal foramen (opening), which in some cases is larger than that of any living vertebrate. Although fossils seldom preserve deep-brain soft anatomy, the brain of the Russian fossil bird &quot;Cerebavis cenomanica&quot; from Melovatka, about 90 million years old, shows a relatively large parietal eye and pineal gland.

==History==

The secretory activity of the pineal gland is only partially understood. Its location deep in the brain suggested to philosophers throughout history that it possessed particular importance. This combination led to its being regarded as a &quot;mystery&quot; gland with mystical, metaphysical, and occult theories surrounding its perceived functions. The earliest recorded description of the pineal gland is from the Greek physician Galen in the 2nd century C.E. According to Galen, Herophilus (325–280 B.C.E.) had already considered the structure as a kind of valve that partitioned the brain chambers, particularly for the flow of vital spirits (pneuma). Specifically, the ancient Greeks believed that the structure maintained the movement of vital spirits from the middle (now identified as the third) ventricle to the one in the parencephalis (fourth ventricle).

Galen described the pineal gland in &quot;De usu partium corporis humani, libri VII&quot; (&quot;On the Usefulness of Parts of the Body, Part 8&quot;) and &quot;De anatomicis administrationibus&quot;, &quot;libri IX&quot; (&quot;On Anatomical Procedures, Part 9&quot;). He introduced the name &quot;κωνάριο&quot; (&quot;konario,&quot; often Latinised as &quot;conarium&quot;) that means cone, as in pinecone, in &quot;De usu partium corporis humani.&quot; He correctly located the gland as directly lying behind the third ventricle. He argued against the prevailing concept of it as a valve for two basic reasons: it is located outside of the brain tissue and it does not move on its own.&quot;&quot;

Galen instead identified the valve as a worm-like structure in the cerebellum (later called vermiform epiphysis, known today as the &quot;vermis cerebelli&quot; or cerebellar vermis). From his study on the blood vessels surrounding the pineal gland he discovered the great vein of the cerebellum, later called the vein of Galen. He could not establish any functional role of the pineal gland and regarded it as a structural support for the cerebral veins.

Seventeenth-century philosopher and scientist René Descartes discussed the pineal gland both in his first book, the &quot;Treatise of Man&quot; (written before 1637, but only published posthumously 1662/1664), and in his last book, &quot;The Passions of the Soul&quot; (1649) and he regarded it as &quot;the principal seat of the soul and the place in which all our thoughts are formed&quot;. In the &quot;Treatise of Man&quot;, he described conceptual models of man, namely creatures created by God, which consist of two ingredients, a body and a soul. In the &quot;Passions&quot;, he split man up into a body and a soul and emphasized that the soul is joined to the whole body by &quot;a certain very small gland situated in the middle of the brain&#x27;s substance and suspended above the passage through which the spirits in the brain&#x27;s anterior cavities communicate with those in its posterior cavities&quot;. Descartes gave importance to the structure as it was the only unpaired component of the brain.

The Latin name &quot;pinealis&quot; became popular in the 17th century. For example, English physician Thomas Willis described a &quot;glandula pinealis&quot; in his book, &quot;Cerebri anatome cui accessit nervorum descriptio et usus&quot; (1664)&quot;.&quot; Willis criticised Descartes&#x27;s concept, remarking: &quot;we can scarce[ly] believe this to be the seat of the Soul, or its chief Faculties to arise from it; because Animals, which seem to be almost quite destitute of Imagination, Memory, and other superior Powers of the Soul, have this Glandula or Kernel large and fair enough.&quot;

Walter Baldwin Spencer at the University of Oxford gave the first description of the pineal gland in lizards. In 1886, he described an eye-like structure, which he called the pineal eye or parietal eye, that was associated with the parietal foramen and the pineal stalk. The presence of a pineal body was already discovered by German zoologist Franz Leydig in 1872, in European lizards. Leydig called them the &quot;frontal organ&quot; (German &quot;stirnorgan&quot;). In 1918, Swedish zoologist Nils Holmgren described the &quot;parietal eye&quot; in frogs and dogfish. He discovered that the parietal eyes were made up of sensory cells similar to the cone cells of the retina, and suggested that it was a primitive light-sensor organ (photoreceptor).

The pineal gland was originally believed to be a &quot;vestigial remnant&quot; of a larger organ. Epiphysan – an extract derived from the pineal glands of cattle – was historically used by veterinarians for rut suppression in mares and cows. In the 1930s it was tested on humans, and resulted in a temporary reduction in their masturbation impulse. In 1917, it was known that extract of cow pineals lightened frog skin. Dermatology professor Aaron B. Lerner and colleagues at Yale University, hoping that a hormone from the pineal gland might be useful in treating skin diseases, isolated it and named it melatonin in 1958. The substance did not prove to be helpful as intended, but its discovery helped solve several mysteries, such as why removing a rat&#x27;s pineal gland accelerated its ovary growth, why keeping rats in constant light decreased the weight of their pineals, and why pinealectomy and constant light affect ovary growth to an equal extent; this knowledge gave a boost to the then-new field of chronobiology. Of the endocrine organs, the function of the pineal gland was the last to be discovered.

== Society and culture ==
The notion of a &quot;pineal-eye&quot; is central to the philosophy of the French writer Georges Bataille, which is analyzed at length by literary scholar Denis Hollier in his study &quot;Against Architecture&quot;. In this work Hollier discusses how Bataille uses the concept of a &quot;pineal-eye&quot; as a reference to a blind-spot in Western rationality, and an organ of excess and delirium. This conceptual device is explicit in his surrealist texts, &quot;The Jesuve&quot; and &quot;The Pineal Eye&quot;.

In the late 19th century Madame Blavatsky, founder of theosophy, identified the pineal gland with the Hindu concept of the third eye, or the &quot;Ajna chakra&quot;. This association is still popular today. The pineal gland has also featured in other religious contexts, such as in the &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, which claims it can be used to contact the goddess of discord Eris.

In the short story &quot;From Beyond&quot; by H. P. Lovecraft, a scientist creates an electronic device that emits a resonance wave, which stimulates an affected person&#x27;s pineal gland, thereby allowing them to perceive planes of existence outside the scope of accepted reality, a translucent, alien environment that overlaps our own recognized reality. It was adapted as a film of the same name in 1986. The 2013 horror film &quot;Banshee Chapter&quot; is heavily influenced by this short story.
In Season 16, episode 6 of &quot;American Dad&quot; Steve tries to &quot;astral project&quot; using his pineal gland to help him understand the meaning of life. The episode is entitled &quot;The Wondercabinet&quot;.

<doc id="285156" wikidata="Q427977" url="?curid=285156" title="Dummy variable (statistics)">
<text>In regression analysis, a dummy variable (also known as indicator variable or just dummy) is one that takes a binary value (0 or 1) to indicate the absence or presence of some categorical effect that may be expected to shift the outcome. For example, if we were studying the relationship between biological sex and income, we could use a dummy variable to represent the sex of each individual in the study. The variable could take on a value of 1 for males and 0 for females (or vice versa). In machine learning this is known as one-hot encoding.

Dummy variables are commonly used in regression analysis to represent categorical variables that have more than two levels, such as education level or occupation. In this case, multiple dummy variables would be created to represent each level of the variable, and only one dummy variable would take on a value of 1 for each observation. Dummy variables are useful because they allow us to include categorical variables in our analysis, which would otherwise be difficult to include due to their non-numeric nature. They can also help us to control for confounding factors and improve the validity of our results.

As with any addition of variables to a model, the addition of dummy variables will increase the within-sample model fit (coefficient of determination), but at a cost of fewer degrees of freedom and loss of generality of the model (out of sample model fit). Too many dummy variables result in a model that does not provide any general conclusions.

Dummy variables are useful in various cases. For example, in econometric time series analysis, dummy variables may be used to indicate the occurrence of wars, or major strikes. It could thus be thought of as a Boolean, i.e., a truth value represented as the numerical value 0 or 1 (as is sometimes done in computer programming).

Dummy variables may be extended to more complex cases. For example, seasonal effects may be captured by creating dummy variables for each of the seasons: D1=1 if the observation is for summer, and equals zero otherwise; D2=1 if and only if autumn, otherwise equals zero; D3=1 if and only if winter, otherwise equals zero; and D4=1 if and only if spring, otherwise equals zero. In the panel data fixed effects estimator dummies are created for each of the units in cross-sectional data (e.g. firms or countries) or periods in a pooled time-series. However in such regressions either the constant term has to be removed, or one of the dummies removed making this the base category against which the others are assessed, for the following reason:

If dummy variables for all categories were included, their sum would equal 1 for all observations, which is identical to and hence perfectly correlated with the vector-of-ones variable whose coefficient is the constant term; if the vector-of-ones variable were also present, this would result in perfect multicollinearity, so that the matrix inversion in the estimation algorithm would be impossible. This is referred to as the dummy variable trap.

<text>Melatonin, an indoleamine, is a natural compound produced by various organisms, including bacteria and eukaryotes. Its discovery in 1958 by Aaron B. Lerner and colleagues stemmed from the isolation of a substance from the pineal gland of cows that could induce skin lightening in common frogs. This compound was later identified as a hormone secreted in the brain during the night, playing a crucial role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm, in vertebrates.

In vertebrates, melatonin&#x27;s functions extend to synchronizing sleep-wake cycles, encompassing sleep-wake timing and blood pressure regulation, as well as controlling seasonal rhythmicity (circannual cycle), which includes reproduction, fattening, molting, and hibernation. Its effects are mediated through the activation of melatonin receptors and its role as an antioxidant. In plants and bacteria, melatonin primarily serves as a defense mechanism against oxidative stress, indicating its evolutionary significance. The mitochondria, key organelles within cells, are the main producers of antioxidant melatonin, underscoring the molecule&#x27;s &quot;ancient origins&quot; and its fundamental role in protecting the earliest cells from reactive oxygen species.

In addition to its endogenous functions as a hormone and antioxidant, melatonin is also administered exogenously as a dietary supplement and medication. It is utilized in the treatment of sleep disorders, including insomnia and various circadian rhythm sleep disorders.

==Biological activity==
In humans, melatonin primarily acts as a potent full agonist of two types of melatonin receptors: melatonin receptor 1, with picomolar binding affinity, and melatonin receptor 2, with nanomolar binding affinity. Both receptors are part of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) family, specifically the Gi/o alpha subunit GPCRs, although melatonin receptor 1 also exhibits coupling with Gq alpha subunit.

Furthermore, melatonin functions as a high-capacity antioxidant, or free radical scavenger, within mitochondria, playing a dual role in combating cellular oxidative stress. First, it directly neutralizes free radicals, and second, it promotes the gene expression of essential antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase. This increase in antioxidant enzyme expression is mediated through signal transduction pathways activated by the binding of melatonin to its receptors. Through these mechanisms, melatonin protects the cell against oxidative stress in two ways, and plays other roles in human health than only regulating the sleep-wake cycle.

==Biological functions==
===Circadian rhythm===

In mammals, melatonin is critical for the regulation of sleep–wake cycles, or circadian rhythms. The establishment of regular melatonin levels in human infants occurs around the third month after birth, with peak concentrations observed between midnight and 8:00 am. It has been documented that melatonin production diminishes as a person ages. Additionally, a shift in the timing of melatonin secretion is observed during adolescence, resulting in delayed sleep and wake times, increasing their risk for delayed sleep phase disorder during this period.

The antioxidant properties of melatonin were first recognized in 1993. In vitro studies reveal that melatonin directly neutralizes various reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl (OH•), superoxide (O2−•), and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide (NO•). In plants, melatonin works synergistically with other antioxidants, enhancing the overall effectiveness of each antioxidant. This compound has been found to be twice as efficacious as vitamin E, a known potent lipophilic antioxidant, at scavenging peroxyl radicals. The promotion of antioxidant enzyme expression, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase, is mediated through melatonin receptor-triggered signal transduction pathways.

Melatonin&#x27;s concentration in the mitochondrial matrix is significantly higher than that found in the blood plasma, emphasizing its role not only in direct free radical scavenging but also in modulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes and maintaining mitochondrial integrity. This multifaceted role shows the physiological significance of melatonin as a mitochondrial antioxidant, a notion supported by numerous scholars.

Furthermore, the interaction of melatonin with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species results in the formation of metabolites capable of reducing free radicals. These metabolites, including cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), and N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMK), contribute to the broader antioxidative effects of melatonin through further redox reactions with free radicals.

===Immune system===
Melatonin&#x27;s interaction with the immune system is recognized, yet the specifics of these interactions remain inadequately defined. An anti-inflammatory effect appears to be the most significant. The efficacy of melatonin in disease treatment has been the subject of limited trials, with most available data deriving from small-scale, preliminary studies. It is posited that any beneficial immunological impact is attributable to melatonin&#x27;s action on high-affinity receptors (MT1 and MT2), which are present on immunocompetent cells. Preclinical investigations suggest that melatonin may augment cytokine production and promote the expansion of T cells, thereby potentially mitigating acquired immunodeficiencies.

=== Weight regulation ===
Melatonin&#x27;s potential to regulate weight gain is posited to involve its inhibitory effect on leptin, a hormone that serves as a long-term indicator of the body&#x27;s energy status. Leptin is important for regulating energy balance and body weight by signaling satiety and reducing food intake. Melatonin, by modulating leptin&#x27;s actions outside of waking hours, may contribute to the restoration of leptin sensitivity during daytime, thereby counteracting leptin resistance.

==Biochemistry==

===Biosynthesis===
The biosynthesis of melatonin in animals involves a sequence of enzymatic reactions starting with -tryptophan, which can be synthesized through the shikimate pathway from chorismate, found in plants, or obtained from protein catabolism. The initial step in the melatonin biosynthesis pathway is the hydroxylation of -tryptophan&#x27;s indole ring by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Subsequently, 5-HTP undergoes decarboxylation, facilitated by pyridoxal phosphate and the enzyme 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase, yielding serotonin.

Serotonin, an essential neurotransmitter, is further converted into &quot;N&quot;-acetylserotonin by the action of serotonin &quot;N&quot;-acetyltransferase, utilizing acetyl-CoA. The final step in the pathway involves the methylation of &quot;N&quot;-acetylserotonin&#x27;s hydroxyl group by hydroxyindole &quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase, with &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor, to produce melatonin.

In bacteria, protists, fungi, and plants, the synthesis of melatonin also involves tryptophan as an intermediate but originates indirectly from the shikimate pathway. The pathway commences with -erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and in photosynthetic cells, additionally involves carbon dioxide. While the subsequent biosynthetic reactions share similarities with those in animals, there are slight variations in the enzymes involved in the final stages.

The hypothesis that melatonin synthesis occurs within mitochondria and chloroplasts suggests an evolutionary and functional significance of melatonin in cellular energy metabolism and defense mechanisms against oxidative stress, reflecting the molecule&#x27;s ancient origins and its multifaceted roles across different domains of life.

=== Mechanism ===
The mechanism of melatonin biosynthesis initiates with the hydroxylation of -tryptophan, a process that requires the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (THB) to react with oxygen and the active site iron of tryptophan hydroxylase. Although the complete mechanism is not entirely understood, two main mechanisms have been proposed:

The first mechanism involves a slow transfer of one electron from THB to molecular oxygen (O2), potentially producing a superoxide (). This superoxide could then recombine with the THB radical to form 4a-peroxypterin. 4a-peroxypterin may either react with the active site iron (II) to create an iron-peroxypterin intermediate or directly transfer an oxygen atom to the iron, facilitating the hydroxylation of -tryptophan.

Alternatively, the second mechanism proposes that oxygen interacts with the active site iron (II) first, forming iron (III) superoxide. This molecule could then react with THB to form an iron-peroxypterin intermediate.

Following the formation of iron (IV) oxide from the iron-peroxypterin intermediate, this oxide selectively attacks a double bond to yield a carbocation at the C5 position of the indole ring. A subsequent 1,2-shift of the hydrogen and the loss of one of the two hydrogen atoms on C5 would restore aromaticity, producing 5-hydroxy--tryptophan.

The decarboxylation of 5-hydroxy--tryptophan to produce 5-hydroxytryptamine is then facilitated by a decarboxylase enzyme with pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. PLP forms an imine with the amino acid derivative, facilitating the breaking of the carbon–carbon bond and release of carbon dioxide. The protonation of the amine derived from tryptophan restores the aromaticity of the pyridine ring, leading to the production of 5-hydroxytryptamine and PLP.

Serotonin &quot;N&quot;-acetyltransferase, with histidine residue His122, is hypothesized to deprotonate the primary amine of 5-hydroxytryptamine. This deprotonation allows the lone pair on the amine to attack acetyl-CoA, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. The thiol from coenzyme A then acts as a leaving group when attacked by a general base, producing &quot;N&quot;-acetylserotonin.

The final step in the biosynthesis of melatonin involves the methylation of &quot;N&quot;-acetylserotonin at the hydroxyl position by SAM, resulting in the production of &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and melatonin.

=== Regulation ===
In vertebrates, the secretion of melatonin is regulated through the activation of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor by the hormone norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increases the concentration of intracellular cAMP via beta-adrenergic receptors, which in turn activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates arylalkylamine &quot;N&quot;-acetyltransferase (AANAT), the penultimate enzyme in the melatonin synthesis pathway. When exposed to daylight, noradrenergic stimulation ceases, leading to the immediate degradation of the protein by proteasomal proteolysis. The production of melatonin recommences in the evening, a phase known as the dim-light melatonin onset.

Blue light, especially within the range, inhibits the biosynthesis of melatonin, with the degree of suppression being directly proportional to the intensity and duration of light exposure. Historically, humans in temperate climates experienced limited exposure to blue daylight during winter months, primarily receiving light from sources that emitted predominantly yellow light, such as fires. The incandescent light bulbs used extensively throughout the 20th century emitted relatively low levels of blue light. It has been found that light containing only wavelengths greater than 530 nm does not suppress melatonin under bright-light conditions. The use of glasses that block blue light in the hours preceding bedtime can mitigate melatonin suppression. Additionally, wearing blue-blocking goggles during the last hours before bedtime is recommended for individuals needing to adjust to an earlier bedtime since melatonin facilitates the onset of sleep.

===Metabolism===
Melatonin is metabolized with an elimination half-life ranging from 20 to 50 minutes. The primary metabolic pathway transforms melatonin into 6-hydroxymelatonin, which is then conjugated with sulfate and excreted in urine as a waste product. It is primarily metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A1, CYP2C19, and CYP1B1.

===Measurement===
For both research and clinical purposes, melatonin levels in humans can be determined through saliva or blood plasma analysis.

==Use as a medication and supplement==
Melatonin is used both as a prescription medication and an over-the-counter dietary supplement for the management of sleep disorders, including insomnia and various circadian rhythm sleep disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder, jet lag disorder, and shift work sleep disorder. In addition to melatonin, a range of synthetic melatonin receptor agonists, namely ramelteon, tasimelteon, and agomelatine, are used in medicine.

A study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in April 2023 found that only 12% of the 30 melatonin gummy product preparations analyzed had melatonin quantities within ±10% of the amounts specified on their labels. Some gummy supplements were found to contain up to 347% of the declared melatonin content. In Europe, melatonin is classified as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, highlighting the regulatory oversight of its use and distribution. Conversely, , the United States was considering the inclusion of melatonin in pharmacy compounding practices. A preceding study from 2022 concluded that consuming unregulated melatonin products can expose individuals, including children, to melatonin quantities ranging from 40 to 130 times higher than the recommended levels when products are used &#x27;as directed&#x27;.

Anecdotal reports and formal research studies over the past few decades have established a link between melatonin supplementation and more vivid dreams.

==History==
=== Discovery ===
Melatonin&#x27;s discovery is linked to the study of skin color changes in some amphibians and reptiles, a phenomenon initially observed through the administration of pineal gland extracts. In 1917, Carey Pratt McCord and Floyd P. Allen found that feeding extracts from the pineal glands of cows caused the skin of tadpoles to lighten by contracting the dark epidermal melanophores.

The hormone melatonin was isolated in 1958 by Aaron B. Lerner, a dermatology professor, and his team at Yale University. Motivated by the possibility that a substance from the pineal gland could be beneficial in treating skin diseases, they extracted and identified melatonin from bovine pineal gland extracts. Subsequent research in the mid-1970s by Lynch and others demonstrated that melatonin production follows a circadian rhythm in human pineal glands.

The first patent for the therapeutic use of melatonin as a low-dose sleep aid was awarded to Richard Wurtman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1995.

=== Etymology ===
The etymology of &quot;melatonin&quot; stems from its skin-lightening properties. As detailed in their publication in the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot;, Lerner and his colleagues proposed the name melatonin, derived from the Greek words &quot;melas&quot;, meaning &#x27;black&#x27; or &#x27;dark&#x27;, and &quot;tonos&quot;, meaning &#x27;labour&#x27;, &#x27;colour&#x27; or &#x27;suppress&#x27;. This naming convention follows that of serotonin, another agent affecting skin color, discovered in 1948 as a modulator of vascular tone, which influenced its name based on its serum vasoconstrictor effect. Melatonin was thus aptly named to reflect its role in preventing the darkening of the skin, highlighting the intersection of biochemistry and linguistics in scientific discovery.

==Occurrence==

===Animals and Humans===
In vertebrates, melatonin is produced in darkness, thus usually at night, by the pineal gland, a small endocrine gland
located in the center of the brain but outside the blood–brain barrier. Light/dark information reaches the suprachiasmatic nuclei from retinal photosensitive ganglion cells of the eyes rather than the melatonin signal (as was once postulated). Known as &quot;the hormone of darkness&quot;, the onset of melatonin at dusk promotes activity in nocturnal (night-active) animals and sleep in diurnal ones including humans.

In humans, ~30 μg of melatonin is produced daily and 80% of the total amount is produced in the night (W). The plasma maximum concentration of melatonin at night are 80–120 pg/mL and the concentrations during the day are between 10–20 pg/mL.

Many animals and humans use the variation in duration of melatonin production each day as a seasonal clock. In animals including humans, the profile of melatonin synthesis and secretion is affected by the variable duration of night in summer as compared to winter. The change in duration of secretion thus serves as a biological signal for the organization of daylength-dependent (photoperiodic) seasonal functions such as reproduction, behavior, coat growth, and camouflage coloring in seasonal animals. In seasonal breeders that do not have long gestation periods and that mate during longer daylight hours, the melatonin signal controls the seasonal variation in their sexual physiology, and similar physiological effects can be induced by exogenous melatonin in animals including mynah birds and hamsters. Melatonin can suppress libido by inhibiting secretion of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone from the anterior pituitary gland, especially in mammals that have a breeding season when daylight hours are long. The reproduction of long-day breeders is repressed by melatonin and the reproduction of short-day breeders is stimulated by melatonin. In sheep, melatonin administration has also shown antioxidant and immune-modulatory regime in prenatally stressed offspring helping them survive the crucial first days of their lives.

During the night, melatonin regulates leptin, lowering its levels.

Cetaceans have lost all the genes for melatonin synthesis as well as those for melatonin receptors. This is thought to be related to their unihemispheric sleep pattern (one brain hemisphere at a time). Similar trends have been found in sirenians.

===Plants===
Until its identification in plants in 1987, melatonin was for decades thought to be primarily an animal neurohormone. When melatonin was identified in coffee extracts in the 1970s, it was believed to be a byproduct of the extraction process. Subsequently, however, melatonin has been found in all plants that have been investigated. It is present in all the different parts of plants, including leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and seeds, in varying proportions. Melatonin concentrations differ not only among plant species, but also between varieties of the same species depending on the agronomic growing conditions, varying from picograms to several micrograms per gram. Notably high melatonin concentrations have been measured in popular beverages such as coffee, tea, wine, and beer, and crops including corn, rice, wheat, barley, and oats. In some common foods and beverages, including coffee and walnuts, the concentration of melatonin has been estimated or measured to be sufficiently high to raise the blood level of melatonin above daytime baseline values.

Although a role for melatonin as a plant hormone has not been clearly established, its involvement in processes such as growth and photosynthesis is well established. Only limited evidence of endogenous circadian rhythms in melatonin levels has been demonstrated in some plant species and no membrane-bound receptors analogous to those known in animals have been described. Rather, melatonin performs important roles in plants as a growth regulator, as well as environmental stress protector. It is synthesized in plants when they are exposed to both biological stresses, for example, fungal infection, and nonbiological stresses such as extremes of temperature, toxins, increased soil salinity, drought, etc.

Herbicide-induced oxidative stress has been experimentally mitigated &quot;in vivo&quot; in a high-melatonin transgenic rice. Studies conducted on lettuce grown in saline soil conditions have shown that the application of melatonin significantly mitigates the harmful effects of salinity. Foliar application increases the number of leaves, their surface area, increases fresh weight and the content of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, and the content of carotenoids compared to plants not treated with melatonin.

Fungal disease resistance is another role. Added melatonin increases resistance in &quot;Malus prunifolia&quot; against &quot;Diplocarpon mali&quot;. Also acts as a growth inhibitor on fungal pathogens including &quot;Alternaria&quot;, &quot;Botrytis&quot;, and &quot;Fusarium&quot; spp. Decreases the speed of infection. As a seed treatment, protects &quot;Lupinus albus&quot; from fungi. Dramatically slows &quot;Pseudomonas syringae tomato&quot; DC3000 infecting &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; and infecting &quot;Nicotiana benthamiana&quot;.

===Fungi===
Melatonin has been observed to reduce stress tolerance in &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot; in plant-pathogen systems. Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk have used genetically modified yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;) to produce melatonin.

=== Bacteria ===
Melatonin is produced by α-proteobacteria and photosynthetic cyanobacteria. There is no report of its occurrence in archaea which indicates that melatonin originated in bacteria most likely to prevent the first cells from the damaging effects of oxygen in the primitive Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Novo Nordisk have used genetically modified &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; to produce melatonin.

=== Archaea ===
In 2022, the discovery of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT)—the penultimate, rate-limiting enzyme in the melatonin biosynthetic pathway—in the archaeon &quot;Thermoplasma volcanium&quot; firmly places melatonin biosynthesis in all three major domains of life, dating back to ~4 Gya.

=== Food products ===
Naturally-occurring melatonin has been reported in foods including tart cherries to about 0.17–13.46 ng/g, bananas, plums, grapes, rice, cereals, herbs, olive oil, wine, and beer. The consumption of milk and sour cherries may improve sleep quality. When birds ingest melatonin-rich plant feed, such as rice, the melatonin binds to melatonin receptors in their brains. When humans consume foods rich in melatonin, such as banana, pineapple, and orange, the blood levels of melatonin increase significantly.

<text>Helge Rosvaenge (born Helge Anton Rosenvinge Hansen, 29 August 189717 June 1972) was a Danish-born operatic tenor whose career was centred on Germany and Austria, before, during and after World War II. His last name is sometimes spelled Roswaenge or Rosvænge.

Rosvaenge was born in Copenhagen. However, his life was spent in Germany, and he made his debut at Neustrelitz as Don Jose in &quot;Carmen&quot; in 1921. Engagements followed at Altenburg, Basel, Cologne (1927–30) and the Berlin State Opera, where he was leading tenor from 1930 to 1944, being especially distinguished in the Italian repertory. He also sang regularly at the Vienna State Opera from 1936, and in Munich. Rosvaenge also appeared at the Salzburg Festival, making his debut there in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;. Other roles which he performed at Salzburg between 1933 and 1939 were Tamino in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, Huon in &quot;Oberon&quot; and Florestan in &quot;Fidelio&quot;. His London debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, occurred in 1938, as Florestan.

He sang &quot;Parsifal&quot; at the Bayreuth Festival in 1934 and 1936, but otherwise the Wagnerian repertory was mostly on recordings.

He also appeared in films, such as &quot;Verlieb&#x27; dich nicht am Bodensee&quot; (1935) and &quot;Last Rose&quot; (1936).

After World War II, Rosvaenge divided his time between Berlin and Vienna. He continued to sing until 30 May 1959 (when he gave what was billed as his farewell concert at Vienna&#x27;s Great Musikvereinssaal), singing arias from Turandot as Calàf, Aida as Radamès and Il trovatore as Manrico. His voice showed little sign of age; it was still warm and sonorous throughout its range, and brilliant and lustrous in its upper register. Indeed, he could produce an easy and full-blooded high D during his vocal prime. This can be heard in one of his most celebrated recordings, the Postillon&#x27;s Song (&quot;Mes amis, écoutez l&#x27;histoire&quot;) from &quot;Le postillon de Lonjumeau&quot; by Adolphe Adam.

Rosvaenge appeared in a wide spectrum of roles ranging from Mozart to Weber, from Verdi to Puccini. He sang with &quot;a steely voice, brilliant high notes and insistent declamation throughout its scale&quot; which was &quot;brilliant and lustrous in its top register&quot;, according to Luiz Eduardo Goncalves Gabarra. He was equally impressive as Andrea Chénier and was also an acclaimed and exciting Radamès and Otello, in which latter role he was often heard on German radio.

He toured the US before retiring, and died in Munich at 74.

==Repertoire==
==Recordings==
Rosvaenge was a prolific recording artist starting as early as 1927, first for the Gramophone Company (now EMI) and later on the Telefunken, Parlophone and Odeon labels. Many of these recordings have been reissued on CD. The finest of them were made in the 1930s and early 1940s.

A recording of his solo tenor singing in a 1938 performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini has been released on CD as well.

<doc id="285176" wikidata="Q1050859" url="?curid=285176" title="Gilbert and Ellice Islands">
<text>The Gilbert and Ellice Islands (GEIC as a colony) in the Pacific Ocean was part of the British Empire from 1892 to 1976. It was a protectorate from 1892 to 12 January 1916, and then a colony until 1 January 1976, and was administered as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT) until it became independent as two separate states. The history of GEIC was mainly characterized by phosphate mining on Ocean Island. In October 1975, these islands were divided by force of law into two separate colonies, and they became independent nations shortly thereafter: the Ellice Islands became Tuvalu in 1978, and the Gilbert Islands with Banaba (Ocean Island) became part of Kiribati in 1979.

==Location==

The Gilbert Islands sometimes also known as &quot;Kingsmill Islands&quot; or &quot;King&#x27;s-Mill Islands&quot; are a chain of sixteen atolls and coral islands in the western Pacific Ocean. They are part of Remote Oceania, and traditionally part of the Micronesia subregion of Oceania. The Gilbert Islands are the main part of what is now the Republic of Kiribati (&quot;Kiribati&quot; is the Gilbertese rendition of &quot;Gilberts&quot;) The atolls of the Gilbert Islands are arranged in an approximate north-to-south line.

Geographically, the Equator is the dividing line between the northern Gilbert Islands and the southern Gilbert Islands. South of the Gilbert Islands lie the Ellice Islands (now called Tuvalu), which were previously politically connected as part of the GEIC. The Ellice Islands comprise three reef islands and six true atolls, spread out between the latitude of 5° to 10° south and longitude of 176° to 180°, west of the International Date Line. The Ellice Islands are midway between Hawaii and Australia, and they, too, lie in the Polynesia subregion of Oceania.

==European discovery and naming==

In 1568, when Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira was commissioned to explore the South Pacific, he sailed relatively close to the Gilbert Islands. He sailed between the Line Islands and the Phoenix Islands, but without sighting land. He ultimately sailed past what he called &quot;Isla de Jesús&quot;, (probably Nui, amongst the Ellice island group).

In 1606, Pedro Fernandes de Queirós sighted two of the islands in the Gilbert island group: Butaritari and Makin, which he named the Buen Viaje Islands (&#x27;good trip&#x27; islands in Spanish).

In 1788, Thomas Gilbert, a British captain, encountered the archipelago while commanding one of two ships of the First Fleet that were looking for an outer passage route from Port Jackson to Canton. In 1820, a Russian admiral, Johann von Krusenstern, named the group &quot;îles Gilbert&quot; (French for Gilbert Islands) in honor of Captain Gilbert&#x27;s earlier voyage. Around that time, the French captain Louis Duperrey became the first to map the whole Gilbert Islands archipelago. He commanded &quot;La Coquille&quot;, circumnavigating the globe between 1822 and 1825.

The first recorded sighting by Europeans of an Ellice Island was on 16 January 1568, during the voyage of Álvaro de Mendaña from Spain, who sailed past Nui and charted it as &quot;Isla de Jesús&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Island of Jesus&quot;) because the previous day was the feast of the Holy Name. Mendaña made contact with the islanders but was unable to land. During Mendaña&#x27;s second voyage across the Pacific, he passed Niulakita on 29 August 1595, which he named &quot;La Solitaria&quot;. Captain John Byron passed through the Ellice islands in 1764, during his circumnavigation of the globe as captain of the . He charted the atolls as &quot;Lagoon Islands&quot;. Nanumea was sighted by Spanish naval officer Francisco Mourelle de la Rúa who sailed past it on 5 May 1781 with frigate &quot;La Princesa&quot;, when attempting a southern crossing of the Pacific from the Philippines to New Spain. He charted Nanumea as &quot;San Augustin&quot;.

In 1809, Captain Patterson in the brig &quot;Elizabeth&quot; sighted Nanumea while passing through the northern Tuvalu waters on a trading voyage from Port Jackson, Sydney, Australia to China. Captain Arent de Peyster sighted the rest of the Ellice island group in 1819, while sailing the ship &quot;Rebecca&quot;. He named Funafuti atoll &quot;Ellice&#x27;s Island&quot;, after Edward Ellice, a British politician and merchant who owned the ship&#x27;s cargo. After the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay was published, the name Ellice was applied to all nine islands in the Ellice Island group, which is now called Tuvalu.
Two ships of the United States Exploring Expedition, and , under the command of Captain Hudson, surveyed the Gilbert Islands of Tabiteuea, Nonouti, Aranuka, Maiana, Abemama, Kuria, Tarawa, Marakei, Butaritari, and Makin (then called the Kingsmill Islands or Kingsmill Group in English). While in the Gilberts, they devoted considerable time to mapping and charting reefs and anchorages. Alfred Thomas Agate made drawings of men of Butaritari and Makin.

==&#x27;Spheres of influence&#x27; in the western and central Pacific==
In 1876 Britain and Germany agreed to divide up the western and central Pacific, with each claiming a &#x27;sphere of influence&#x27;. In the previous decade German traders had become active in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands. In 1877 the Governor of Fiji was given the additional title of High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. However, the claim of a &#x27;sphere of influence&#x27; that included the Ellice Islands and the Gilbert Islands did not result in the immediate move to govern those islands. Ships from the navies of the United States of America and European powers that visited the Gilbert and Ellice Islands included:

===United Kingdom===
Ships of the Royal Navy, on the Australian Station, were involved in suppressing the coercive labour recruitment practices, known as blackbirding in the South Pacific Ocean.

1872, from 10 to 14 October, the sloop , under Captain Cortland Herbert Simpson, visited Tawara, Abaiang and Butaritari. Also in 1872, the sloop , under Captain John Moresby, visited the Gilberts, and the corvette , under Captain Lewis James Moore, visited Tabiteuea.

1873, from 28 to 30 June, the schooner , under Captain Francis W. Sanders, lands islanders on Tabiteuea and Maiana who had been kidnapped in 1871 by the brig &quot;Carl&quot;. The screw sloop also visited the Gilberts in 1873.

1874, in August, the screw sloop , under Commander Arthur Edward Dupuis, visited Tawara and Abaiang searching for William &quot;Bully&quot; Hayes, who was notorious for his blackbirding activities.

1875, the survey ship , under Commander Richard Hare, visited the Gilberts.

1876, from April to June, the schooner , under Lieutenant Horace J. M. Pugh, visited Abaiang and Tawara, regarding the murders in 1874, of Cornelius Sullivan on Tarawa, and St. John C. Keyes on Abaiang. The screw sloop , under Commander Noel Stephen Fox Digby, was also sent to the Gilberts in support of HMS &quot;Renard&quot;.

1881, from 13 May to 6 June, the corvette HMS , under Captain William Maxwell, visited the Gilbert and Ellice Islands.

1883, from 26 May to 10 June, the sloop , under Captain Cyprian Bridge, visited the Gilbert and Ellice Islands.

1884, from 13 June to 26 July, the survey ship , under Lieutenant-Commander W. W. Moore, visited the Gilbert and Ellice Islands.

1886, from 10 May to 26 June, the sloop , under Commander Eustace Rooke, visited the Gilbert and Ellice Islands.

1892, from 14 April to 30 August, the screw sloop , under Captain Edward Davis, visited the Gilbert and Ellice Islands.

===United States===
1825, the schooner , under Lieutenant Hiram Paulding, visited Nikunau and Tabiteuea.

1870, from 15 to 26 May, the sloop , under Captain William Truxtun, visited Tawara, Abaiang and Butaritari.

1872, in August, the sloop visited Nikunau, Beru, Tabiteuea, Abaiang and Tawara.

1889, the steam powered sloop visited Butaritari.

===France===
1874, the corvette &quot;L&#x27;Ariane&quot; visited Arorae and Ocean Island.

1888, the cruiser &quot;Le Fabert&quot;, under Commander Benoit, visited Nikunau, Nonouti and Butaritari to deliver Father Joseph Leray, Father Edward Bontemps and Brother Conrad Weber, Roman Catholic Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, who were the first Roman Catholic missionaries to arrive in the Gilberts.

===Germany===
SMS &quot;Eber&quot; of the German (Imperial Navy), was sent to the Pacific to serve in the German colonial empire. In 1888 she visited the Gilberts, and also disarmed the inhabitants of Nauru, ending their civil war and annexing the island to the German Empire.

1891, the steam corvette SMS visited the Gilberts (Marakei, Tawara, Abaiang, Abemama and Tabiteuea). Also in 1891, the gunboat visited Tawara, Abaiang and Maiana, and the cruiser SMS visited Butaritari, Maiana and Tabiteuea.

==Administration of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands==
===The &quot;Pacific Islanders Protection Act&quot; 1872 &amp; 1875===

In 1872, the United Kingdom passed legislation in an attempt to control the coercive labour recruitment practices known as blackbirding: the &quot;Pacific Islanders Protection Act&quot; 1872 (the principal Act), which was amended by the &quot;Pacific Islanders Protection Act&quot; 1875. The principal Act provided for the Governor of one of the Australian colonies to have the authority to licence British vessels in the South Pacific Ocean to carry &quot;native labourers&quot;. The 1875 Act amended that licensing system and stated that any &quot;British vessel may, under the principal Act, be detained, seized, and brought in for adjudication by any officer, all goods and effects found on board such vessel may also be detained, seized, and brought in for adjudication by such officer, either with or without such vessel&quot; with the &quot;High Court of Admiralty of England and every Vice-Admiralty Court in Her Majesty&#x27;s dominions out of the United Kingdom shall have jurisdiction to try and condemn as forfeited to Her Majesty or restore any vessel, goods, and effects alleged to be detained or seized in pursuance of the principal Act or of this Act&quot;. The 1875 Act also provided authority for &quot;Her Majesty to exercise power and jurisdiction over Her subjects within any islands and places in the Pacific Ocean not being within Her Majesty&#x27;s dominions, nor within the jurisdiction of any civilized power, in the same and as ample a manner as if such power or jurisdiction had been acquired by the cession or conquest of territory&quot;, although the 1875 Act did not specify any Pacific islands to which this authority was to be applied.

The 1872 &amp; 1875 Acts were intended to work in conjunction with the &quot;British Slave Trade Act&quot; 1839 to provide the authority to arrest blackbirding ships, and charge their captains and owners with slavery charges. However, this approach to suppressing blackbirding was not successful. In 1869, HMS Commander George Palmer of HMS Rosario (1860), commenced a prosecution in the New South Wales courts of Thomas Pritchard and Captain Dagget of the &quot;Daphne&quot;. Commander Palmer had found the &quot;Daphne&quot; in harbour at Levuka in Fiji fitted out like an &quot;African slaver&quot;, and filled with Islanders on board looking emaciated and having little knowledge of why they were on the ship. The &quot;Daphne&quot; was owned by Henry Ross Lewin, a long time blackbirder who had been commissioned to import south sea islanders for Robert Towns&#x27; sugar plantations (the entrepreneur after whom Townsville is named). Despite this, Sir Alfred Stephen, the Chief Justice of New South Wales, found Pritchard and Dagget innocent on the grounds that the British Slave Trade Act 1839 did not apply to the South Pacific Ocean.

===Protectorate administered as part of the British Western Pacific Territories===
In 1877, the United Kingdom established a protectorate over the islands designated as being British Western Pacific Territories.

In 1886, an Anglo-German agreement partitioned the &quot;unclaimed&quot; central Pacific, leaving Nauru in the German sphere of influence, while placing Ocean Island and the future GEIC in the British sphere of influence.

German New Guinea was established in 1884, and German protectorates were established on the Marshall Islands and Nauru, in 1885 and 1888, respectively. Then, between 27 May and 17 June 1892, partly in response to the presence of the United States in Butaritari, Captain Edward Davis of made the sixteen islands of the Gilbert Islands a British protectorate. Between 9 and 16 October of the same year, Captain Herbert Gibson of declared the Ellice Islands to be a British protectorate. The British government found it administratively convenient to govern the Ellice and Gilberts islands together.

At first, the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT) were administered by a high commissioner who resided in Fiji (and later in the British Solomon Islands). Then, Sir John Bates Thurston appointed Charles Richard Swayne as the first resident commissioner of the Ellice Islands in 1892 and as the first resident commissioner of the Gilbert Islands in 1893. He was succeeded in 1895 by William Telfer Campbell, who established himself on Tarawa, and remained in office until 1908. Campbell was criticised for his legislative, judicial and administrative management. It was alleged that he extracted forced labour from the islanders. An inquiry into this allegation was held by Arthur Mahaffy, a former district officer in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands (1896–1898) and Solomon Islands (1898-1904), and he issued his findings, which were published in 1910. In 1913, an anonymous correspondent to &quot;The New Age&quot; journal described the maladministration of Telfer Campbell, linked it to criticisms of the Pacific Phosphate Company, which was operating on Ocean Island, and challenged Mahaffy&#x27;s impartiality, because he was a former colonial official in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Protectorate.
In 1908, the government&#x27;s headquarters was moved to Ocean Island (today known as Banaba). Ocean Island had been hastily added to the protectorate in 1900 to take advantage of the improved shipping connections resulting from the Pacific Phosphate Company&#x27;s increased activities. On 12 January 1916, the islands&#x27; status was changed to that of a Crown Colony. The British colonial authorities emphasised that their role was to procure labour for phosphate mining on Ocean Island, and to maintain law and order among the workers.

===Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony (GEIC)===
The islands became a Crown colony on 12 January 1916 by the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Order in Council, 1915.

During the year 1916, the Union Islands (Tokelau) were also annexed to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. On 28 November 1919, Great Britain reasserted its claim to Christmas Island and annexed it to the colony.

In July 1920, the Pacific Phosphate Company was liquidated and its assets sold to the British Phosphate Commission (BPC), a consortium established by the governments of Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand. The mining of the phosphate on Ocean Island represented the main revenue of the colony until it ended in 1979.

In 1925, Great Britain asked New Zealand to accept responsibility for the administration of the Union Islands (Tokelau) and invited the United States to annex Swains Island. On 4 March 1925, the United States officially annexed Swains Island as part of the territory of American Samoa. On 11 February 1926, an Order in Council transferred responsibility for administration of the Union Islands (Tokelau) to New Zealand which in turn placed administration of the islands under its Western Samoan mandate.
Fanning Island and Washington Island also became included in the colony together with the Union Islands (now known as Tokelau); Christmas Island was included in 1919 but was unofficially contested by the USA under its Guano Islands Act of 1856. The Union Islands were transferred to New Zealand in 1926, but formally only in 1948.

The Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony continued to be administered by a Resident Commissioner. In 1930 the Resident Commissioner, Arthur Grimble, issued revised laws, &quot;Regulations for the good Order and Cleanliness of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands&quot;, which replaced laws created during the BWTP.

In the 1930s, British officials tried to choose a less cumbersome name for the GEIC. Critics jocularly called the arbitrary collection of atolls scattered across the central Pacific the &quot;Gilbert and Sullivans&quot; (a reference to the famous light opera composers). One official suggested renaming the islands &quot;Quateria&quot; (after the word &quot;quarters&quot;), because the main inhabited archipelago extends over four notable quarters of the globe: It lies partly north and partly south of the equator, and also partly east and partly west of the international dateline. There were indigenous names, such as Tungaru and Tuvalu, but they were used to refer to only some of the islands in the group; they did not include the mostly uninhabited Phoenix and Line island groups, or Banaba (also called Ocean Island), whose phosphate rocks provided half of the GEIC&#x27;s tax revenue. Further complicating the naming problem, the Tokelau atolls were made part of the colony for a decade (1916–1926), and at one point a governor of Fiji, Sir J.B. Thurston, suggested adding Rotuma to the colony to enable a more organized administration of islands that were scattered over such a vast expanse of water. In 1969, after political issues arose that had led to the creation, four years earlier, of the Gilbertese National Party, the hybrid term &quot;Tungavalu&quot; was suggested (combining the indigenous names for the islands of Tungaru and Tuvalu); the idea was rejected because of political tensions between those islands.

On 31 December 1936, the population of the Crown Colony totalled 34,443 inhabitants, including 32,390 Gilbert and Ellice Islanders, 262 Europeans and 923 Chinese (&quot;Mongoloids&quot;). Henry Evans Maude, the land commissioner of the colony, considered the then colony overcrowded. The Phoenix Islands were added to the colony in 1937 with the view of a Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme. On 6 August 1936, a party from HMS &quot;Leith&quot; landed on Canton Island in the Phoenix Group and planted a sign asserting British sovereignty in the name of King Edward VIII. On 18 March 1937, Great Britain annexed the uninhabited Phoenix Islands (except Howland and Baker Islands) to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony.
Banaba (Ocean Island) remained the headquarters of the colony until the British evacuation in 1942 during the Pacific War when Ocean Island and the Gilbert Islands were occupied by the Japanese. The United States forces landed in Funafuti on 2 October 1942 and on Nanumea and Nukufetau in August 1943 and constructed an airfield on each island and other bases. The atolls of Tuvalu acted as a staging post during the preparation for the Battle of Tarawa and the Battle of Makin that commenced on 20 November 1943. Colonel Vivian Fox-Strangways, was the Resident Commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony in 1941, who was located on Funafuti.
After World War II, the colony headquarters was re-established on Tarawa, first on Betio islet and subsequently on Bairiki islet. In November 1945, Fox-Strangways was replaced as Resident Commissioner by Henry Evans Maude (1946 to 1949). He was succeeded by John Peel, who retired in 1951.

By the Tokelau Act of 1948, sovereignty over Tokelau was transferred to New Zealand. The five islands of the Central and Southern Line Islands were added to the colony in 1972.

===Transition to self-determination===
In 1946, Tarawa, in the Gilbert Islands, was made the administrative capital, replacing Ocean Island. The headquarters of the Colony were transferred from Betio to Bairiki. This development included establishing the King George V Secondary School for boys and the Elaine Bernacchi Secondary School for girls.

A Colony Conference was organised at Marakei in 1956, which was attended by officials and representatives (magistrates) from each island in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, conferences were held every two years until 1962. The development of administration continued with the creation in 1963 of an Advisory Council of five officials and 12 representatives who were appointed by the Resident Commissioner. In 1964 an Executive Council was established with eight officials and eight representatives. The representative members were elected in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Advisory Council election held in 1964. The Resident Commissioner was now required to consult the Executive Council regarding the creation of laws to make decisions that affected the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.

The Tungaru Association was created by Reuben Uatioa to &quot;promote Gilbertese culture and interests&quot;, and in 1965, the Gilbertese National Party, first political party of the colony, was established with the same leader, protesting about the lack of consideration that British rulers have towards Gilbertese, preferring somehow the Ellicean civil servants. The Elliceans (further Tuvaluans) were concerned about their minority status in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. In 1974, ethnic differences within the colony caused the Polynesians of the Ellice Islands to vote for separation from the Gilbert Islands (later Kiribati). On 1 October 1975, the Ellice Islands became the separate British colony of Tuvalu, but the separation was completed on 1 January 1976.

A Constitution was introduced in 1967, which created a House of Representatives for the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony that comprised seven appointed officials and 23 members elected by the islanders. Tuvalu elected four members of the House of Representatives. The 1967 Constitution also established the Governing Council. The House of Representatives only had the authority to recommend laws; the Governing Council had the authority to enact laws following a recommendation from the House of Representatives.

A select committee of the House of Representatives was established to consider whether the constitution should be changed to give legislative power to the House of Representatives. The proposal was that Ellice Islanders would be allocated 4 seats out of 24 member parliament, which reflected the differences in populations between Ellice Islanders and Gilbertese. It became apparent that the Elliceans were concerned about their minority status on the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony, and the Elliceans wanted equal representation to that of the Gilbertese. A new constitution was introduced in 1971, which provided that each of the Ellice Islands (except Niulakita) elected one representative. However, that did not end the Tuvaluan movement for separation.

In 1974 Ministerial government was introduced in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony through a change to the Constitution.

Until 1977, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony (GEIC) was designated ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (country code &quot;GE&quot;).

===Elections and the transition to parliamentary government===
The 1967 constitution created a House of Representatives (parliament), whose members were elected in the following elections:

* 1967 Gilbert and Ellice Islands general election
* 1971 Gilbert and Ellice Islands general election
* 1974 Gilbert and Ellice Islands general election

===Dissolution of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony===
A referendum was held in Ellice Islands, including Elliceans living in Ocean Island and Tarawa, from July to September 1974, using a rolling ballot, to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration. The result of the referendum, was that 3,799 Elliceans voted for separation from the Gilbert Islands and continuance of British rule as a separate colony, and 293 Elliceans voted to remain as the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony. There were 40 spoilt papers.

As a consequence of the 1974 Ellice Islands self-determination referendum, separation occurred in two stages. The Tuvaluan Order 1975 made by the Privy Council, which took effect on 1 October 1975, recognised Tuvalu as a separate British dependency with its own government. The second stage occurred on 1 January 1976 when two separate administrations were created out of the civil service of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. The British conducted a formal inquiry into Tuvaluan attitudes towards secession, and announced that a referendum was to be held, in which Tuvaluans could choose to remain with the Gilberts or secede. They were told that if they separated they would not receive royalties from the Ocean Island phosphate or other assets of the colony. Despite this, 3,799 Tuvaluans (92%) voted to secede, while 293 voted against separation. On 1 October 1975, legal separation from the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati), took place. On 1 January 1976, full administration of the new colony was transferred from South Tarawa to Funafuti. Tuvalu became an independent constitutional monarchy and the 38th member of the Commonwealth of Nations on 1 October 1978.

The Gilbert Islands attained independence on 12 July 1979 under the name Kiribati by the Kiribati Independence Order 1979, as a republic with Commonwealth membership. That day the colonial flag was lowered for the last time with a parade commemorating both the newly independent state and in memorial of the intense battles fought on Tarawa in World War II. The parade included many dignitaries from home and abroad. The name Kiribati (pronounced kʲiriˈbas) is the local writing rendition of &quot;Gilberts&quot; in the Gilbertese language.

Banaba, formerly rich in phosphates before becoming fully depleted in the latter colonial years, also sued for independence in 1979 and boycotted the Kiribati ceremonies. The Banabans wanted greater autonomy and reparations of around $250 million for revenue they had not received and for environmental destruction caused by phosphate mining practices similar to those on Nauru. The British authorities had relocated most of the population to Rabi Island, Fiji, after 1945, but by the 1970s some were returning to Banaba. The British rejected the Banaban independence proposal, and the island remained under the jurisdiction of Kiribati.

==Social history==
In 1926, Donald Gilbert Kennedy was the headmaster of Elisefou (New Ellice) on Vaitupu. He was instrumental in establishing the first co-operative store (&quot;fusi&quot;) on Vaitupu, which became a model for the bulk purchasing and selling cooperative stores established in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony to replace the stores operated by Palangi traders.

In 1935, there were 33,713 people in the Colony. (Compared to 1934 when the figures were): Gilbertese, 29,291 (28,654); Ellice Islanders, 4,154 (4,042); Europeans, 244 (254); Chinese (exclusive of indentured labourers), 24 (41).

In 1935, there were 6,924 children receiving primary standard education through 4 government schools and 79 mission schools operated by the London Missionary Society (LMS) and the Roman Catholic Sacred Heart Order. Throughout the Gilbert Islands, instruction was given in the Gilbertese language, except at the King George V. School (Tarawa) and the Sacred Heart Boys&#x27; School (Butaritari), where instruction was delivered in English. In the Ellice Islands, instruction was delivered in the Samoan language, due to the influence of the early LMS Samoan missionaries and the affinity of the Ellice language with Samoan.
During 1935 two students of the King George V. School were sent to the Central Medical School at Suva, Fiji. This made 4 students, 2 Gilbertese and 2 Ellice Islanders being trained as Native Medical Practitioners (as medical practitioners from the islands were described). Eight former students of King George V. School were employed as Native Medical Practitioners in the Colony.

In 1953, the enrolments were: in 12 government schools (722 pupils); the London Missionary Society (4,392); the Roman Catholic Sacred Heart Mission (3,088); and the Seventh Day Adventist Mission, which established schools in the Gilberts in 1950 (165).

New premises for the King George V. School were opened on Bikenibeu, Tarawa, with 109 students, some of whom came from the Government Temporary School at Abemama and other boys came from Elisefou school on Vaitupu, which was also closed. A new curriculum was introduced for primary schools which included instruction in English to the older aged students. The lack of proficiency in the English language was limiting the performance of students at the secondary school level and those seeking to attend universities in other countries.

The Gilbert and Ellice Islands were represented at the 1963 Pacific Games at Suva, Fiji, by tennis players, and also table tennis players who won a bronze medal. A larger team was sent to the 1966 Pacific Games at Nouméa, New Caledonia, including athletes to compete in the half-mile, mile and the high jump event.

In 1965 King George V and Elaine Bernacchi School were merged.

A census in 1968 counted the population of the colony at 53,517 residents. 44,206 were in the Gilbert Islands, 5,782 in the Ellice Islands, 2,192 in Ocean Island and 1,180 in the Line Islands. From this total 7,465 were &quot;Polynesians&quot; (mostly from the Ellice Islands) and 1,155 &quot;Others&quot; (Europeans and Mongoloids).

==Postal history==

The Gilbert and Ellice Islands used their own postage stamps from 1911.

<text>Arcelor S.A. was the world&#x27;s largest steel producer in terms of turnover and the second largest in terms of steel output, with a turnover of €30.2 billion and shipments of 45 million metric tons of steel in 2004. The company was created in 2002 by a merger of the former companies Aceralia (Spain), Usinor (France) and Arbed (Luxembourg). Arcelor is now part of ArcelorMittal after a takeover by Mittal Steel in 2006.

==Business==
Once employing 310,000 employees in over 60 countries, it was a major player in all its main markets: automotive, construction, metal processing, primary transformation, household appliances, and packaging, as well as general industry. With total sales of over €40 billion, Arcelor was, by 2006, one of the world&#x27;s largest steel manufacturer in terms of turnover.

It produced long steel products, flat steel products and inox-steel.

In January 2006 Arcelor announced the acquisition of Dofasco, Canada&#x27;s largest steel producer with an annual output of 4.4 million tons. After an intense bidding war against the German ThyssenKrupp, Arcelor had finally bid 5.6 billion Canadian dollars.

==Merger with Mittal Steel==
The company was the target of a hostile takeover bid by its rival Mittal Steel on 27 January 2006. However, the bid resulted in substantial increase in Arcelor&#x27;s share value. Two members of the board of Arcelor, Guillermo Ulacia and Jacques Chabanier also resigned suddenly. On 26 May 2006 Arcelor announced its intention to merge with Severstal. There were questions about the intentions of Arcelor in announcing its merger with Severstal due to a perceived opacity in the transaction. But on 25 June 2006, the Arcelor board decided to go ahead with the merger with Mittal Steel. Arcelor compensated Severstal €140 million for the failed merger attempt. Lakshmi Mittal became the president and Arcelor chairman Joseph Kinsch was appointed chairman of the new company until his retirement. Arcelor&#x27;s merger with Mittal created the worldwide leader in the steel industry, increasing its bargaining power with suppliers and consumers. Mittal Steel agreed to pay €40.37 a share to Arcelor, doubling its original offer.

===Reaction to the takeover===
Arcelor&#x27;s directors strongly opposed the takeover, as did the governments of France, Luxembourg and Spain. The Belgian government, on the other hand, declared its stance as neutral and invited both parties to deliver a business plan with the future investments in research in the Belgian steel plants. The French opposition was initially very fierce and has been criticized in the Indian media as double standards and economic nationalism in Europe. Indian commerce minister Kamal Nath warned that any attempt by France to block the deal would lead to a trade war between India and France.

On 20 June, the above claim by economists was confirmed when Severstal increased its valuation of Arcelor. Management of Arcelor had in fact undervalued the company itself. The capability of management which had openly supported the previous valuation of Arcelor came into question. Further the combined markets of France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain chided Arcelor management and suspended trading of its stock.

On 26 June, the Board of Directors recommended the approval of the improved Mittal offer (49% improvement compared to the initial offer with 108% improvement of the cash component), proposed the creation of Arcelor-Mittal with industrial and corporate governance model based on Arcelor and scheduled a corporate meeting for 30 June to vote on this.

==Products==
The products of Arcelor are divided into three groups: Flat steel products, long steel products and stainless steel.

===Flat steel products===
The main production sites of flat steel products are Ghent, Dunkirk, Avilés, Gijón, Fos-sur-Mer, Piombino, Liège, Florange, Bremen, Eisenhüttenstadt and recently São Francisco do Sul in Brazil.

<doc id="285182" wikidata="Q259605" url="?curid=285182" title="International Securities Identification Number">
<text>An International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) is a code that uniquely identifies a security globally for the purposes of facilitating clearing, reporting and settlement of trades. Its structure is defined in ISO 6166. The ISIN code is a 12-character alphanumeric code that serves for uniform identification of a security through normalization of the assigned National Number, where one exists, at trading and settlement.

==History==
ISINs were first used in 1981, but did not reach wide acceptance until 1989, when the G30 countries recommended adoption. The ISIN was endorsed a year later by ISO with the ISO 6166 standard.

Initially information was distributed via CD-ROMs and this was later replaced by distribution over the internet.

ISINs slowly gained traction worldwide and became the most popular global securities identifier. Trading, clearing and settlement systems in many countries adopted ISINs as a secondary measure of identifying securities. Some countries, mainly in Europe, moved to using the ISIN as their primary means of identifying securities. European regulations such as Solvency II Directive 2009 increasingly require the ISIN to be reported.

In 2004, the European Union mandated the use of instrument identifiers in some of its regulatory reporting with ISIN as one of the valid identifiers.

== Description ==

&quot;ISO 6166&quot; (or ISO6166:2021 as of the 2021 revision) defines the structure of an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN). An ISIN uniquely identifies a fungible security.

Securities with which ISINs can be used are:
*Equities (shares, units, depository receipts)
*Debt instruments (bonds and debt instruments other than international, international bonds and debt instruments, stripped coupons and principal, treasury bills, others)
*Entitlements (rights, warrants)
*Derivatives (options, futures, and exchange-traded funds)
*Others (commodities, currencies, indices, interest rates)

ISINs consist of two alphabetic characters, which are the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the issuing country, nine alpha-numeric characters (the National Securities Identifying Number, or NSIN, which identifies the security, padded as necessary with leading zeros), and one numerical check digit. They are thus always 12 characters in length. When the NSIN changes due to corporate actions or other reasons, the ISIN will also change. 

An ISIN does not specify a particular trading location. Typically a MIC (Market Identifier Code) or the three-letter exchange code, will have to be specified in addition to the ISIN for this. The currency of the trade will also be required to uniquely identify the instrument using this method.

==Who assigns==
Each country has a national numbering agency responsible for issuing ISINs. Often these are national stock exchanges, central banks, but also financial regulators or financial data provider or clearing houses and rating agencies. A global governing body is the Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA).

Since existing national numbering schemes administered by the various NNAs form the basis for ISINs, the methodology for assignment is not consistent across agencies globally.

==Commercial model==

The ISIN is included in services sold by financial data vendors and intermediaries. The issuer of a security will include the ISIN in issuance papers or other documentation for identification purposes. These services are paid services as more value added data is included with the information of the ISIN.

== Controversy ==
In 2009, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s was charged by the European Commission (EC) with abusing its position in licensing international securities identification codes for United States securities by requiring European financial firms and data vendors to pay licensing fees for their use. &quot;This behaviour amounts to unfair pricing,&quot; the EC said in its statement of objections which lays the groundwork for an adverse finding against S&amp;P. &quot;The (numbers) are indispensable for a number of operations that financial institutions carry out – for instance, reporting to authorities or clearing and settlement – and cannot be substituted&quot;.

In 2011, Standard and Poor&#x27;s provided six undertakings to the European Commission to remedy the situation. The agreement is applicable to all consuming companies in the European Economic Area. These expired at the end of 2016.

== Examples ==

The examples below describes one approach for applying the Luhn algorithm on two different ISINs. The difference in the two examples has to do with if there are an odd or even number of digits after converting letters to number. Since the NSIN element can be any alpha numeric sequence (9 characters), an odd number of letters will result in an even number of digits and an even number of letters will result in an odd number of digits. For an odd number of digits, the approach in the first example is used. For an even number of digits, the approach in the second example is used. The Luhn algorithm can also be applied in the same manner for both types or lengths (alternating multiply the string of digits by 1 and 2, starting from the end of the string), being more generic.

=== Apple, Inc. ===

Apple, Inc.: ISIN US0378331005, expanded from CUSIP 037833100
The main body of the ISIN is the original CUSIP, assigned in the 1970s. The country code &quot;US&quot; has been added on the front, and an additional check digit at the end. The country code indicates the country of issue. The check digit is calculated using the Luhn algorithm.

Convert any letters to numbers by taking the ASCII code of the capital letter and subtracting 55:

U = 30, S = 28. US037833100 -&gt; 30 28 037833100

Collect odd and even characters:

3028037833100 = (3, 2, 0, 7, 3, 1, 0), (0, 8, 3, 8, 3, 0)

Multiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the FIRST group) by 2:

(6, 4, 0, 14, 6, 2, 0)

Add up the individual digits:

(6 + 4 + 0 + (1 + 4) + 6 + 2 + 0) + (0 + 8 + 3 + 8 + 3 + 0) = 45

Take the 10s modulus of the sum:

45 mod 10 = 5

Subtract from 10:

10 − 5 = 5

Take the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).

5 mod 10 = 5

So the ISIN check digit is five.

=== Treasury Corporation of Victoria ===

TREASURY CORP VICTORIA 5 3/4% 2005-2016: ISIN AU0000XVGZA3.
The check digit is calculated using the Luhn algorithm.

Convert any letters to numbers by taking the ASCII code of the capital letter and subtracting 55:

A = 10, G = 16, U = 30, V = 31, X = 33, Z = 35. AU0000XVGZA -&gt; 10 30 0000 33 31 16 35 10.

Collect odd and even characters:

103000003331163510 = (1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 6, 5, 0)

Multiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the SECOND group) by 2:

(0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 2, 12, 10, 0)

Add up the individual digits:

(1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1) + (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 2 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 0) + 0) = 27

Take the 10s modulus of the sum:

27 mod 10 = 7

Subtract from 10:

10 − 7 = 3

Take the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).

3 mod 10 = 3

So the ISIN check digit is three.

=== BAE Systems ===

BAE Systems: ISIN GB0002634946, expanded from SEDOL 000263494

The main body is the SEDOL, padded on the front with the addition of two zeros. The country code &quot;GB&quot; is then added on the front, and the check digit on the end as in the example above.

==Check-digit flaw in ISIN==

The Treasury Corporation of Victoria ISIN illustrates a flaw in ISIN&#x27;s check digit algorithm which allows transposed letters: Suppose the ISIN was mis-typed as AU0000VXGZA3 (instead of AU0000XVGZA3)

A = 10, G = 16, U = 30, V = 31, X = 33, Z = 35. &quot;AU0000VXGZA&quot; -&gt; 10 30 00 00 31 33 16 35 10&quot;.

Collect odd and even characters:

103000003133163510 = (1, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 1, 3, 1), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 5, 0)

Multiply the group containing the rightmost character (which is the SECOND group) by 2:

(0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 12, 10, 0)

Add up the individual digits:

(1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1) + (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 6 + (1 + 2) + (1 + 0) + 0) = 27

Take the 10s modulus of the sum:

27 mod 10 = 7

Subtract from 10:

10 − 7 = 3

Take the 10s modulus of the result (this final step is important in the instance where the modulus of the sum is 0, as the resulting check digit would be 10).

3 mod 10 = 3

So the ISIN check digit is &quot;still&quot; three even though two letters have been transposed.

Such flaw against a single transposed pair of letters or digits would have been avoided using two check digits instead of just one (i.e., a 97 modulus instead of the 10 modulus, like in IBAN numbers which may also mix letters and digits). Some protocols require the transmission of additional check digits added to the full ISIN number.

<doc id="285187" wikidata="Q181229" url="?curid=285187" title="Jennifer Beals">
<text>Jennifer Beals (born December 19, 1963) is an American actress. She made her film debut in &quot;My Bodyguard&quot; (1980), before receiving critical acclaim for her performance as Alexandra Owens in &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983), for which she won NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical.

Beals has appeared in several films including &quot;Vampire&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (1988), &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot; (1994), &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot; (1995), &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; (1998), &quot;Roger Dodger&quot; (2002), &quot;The Book of Eli&quot; (2010), &quot;Before I Fall&quot; (2017), and &quot;Luckiest Girl Alive&quot; (2022). On television, she starred in shows such as &quot;The Chicago Code&quot; (2011), &quot;Proof&quot; (2015), &quot;Taken&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; (2021). Her portrayal of Bette Porter on the Showtime drama series &quot;The L Word&quot; (2004–2009) earned her a nomination for the Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. She reprised her role as Bette Porter and served as an executive producer on the sequel series &quot;The L Word: Generation Q&quot; (2019–2023).

==Early life==
Beals was born and raised in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Jeanne (née Anderson), an elementary school teacher, and Alfred Beals, who owned grocery stores. Beals&#x27;s father was African-American, and her mother is Irish-American. She has two brothers, Bobby and Gregory. Her father died when Beals was nine, after which she spent a summer at Cheley Colorado Camps in Estes Park, Colorado. Her mother married Edward Cohen in 1981. Beals says that her biracial heritage affected her. Of her youth, she says that she &quot;always lived sort of on the outside&quot;, with a feeling &quot;of being the other in society&quot;. Beals&#x27;s first job was at age 13 at an ice cream store, using her height at the time (later ) to convince her boss she was 16 years old.

Two key moments inspired Beals to pursue a career in acting—working on her high school&#x27;s production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, and seeing &quot;Balm in Gilead&quot; (with Joan Allen) while volunteer-ushering at the Steppenwolf Theatre.

Beals graduated from Francis W. Parker School in Chicago, then participated in Goodman Theatre Young People&#x27;s Drama Workshop. She graduated from Yale University with a B.A. in American Literature in 1987. While at Yale, Beals was a resident of Morse College. She deferred a term so she could perform in the feature film &quot;Flashdance&quot;.

==Career==

===Film===

Beals had a minor role in the 1980 film &quot;My Bodyguard&quot;, then came to fame with her starring part in &quot;Flashdance&quot;. The third-highest grossing U.S. film of 1983, &quot;Flashdance&quot; is the story of 18-year-old Alex, a welder by day and sensual dancer by night, whose dream is to be accepted someday at an illustrious school of dance. Beals was cast for this key role while still a student at Yale. She was nominated for a Golden Globe and the film received an Academy Award for Best Song. Many of Beals&#x27;s elaborate dance moves were actually performed by dance double Marine Jahan. Gymnast Sharon Shapiro performed the flips as a body double for actress Beals.

After she filmed &quot;Flashdance&quot;, Beals resumed her studies, making only one film during that time: playing the title role in &quot;The Bride&quot; with singer-actor Sting, a gothic horror film loosely based on the 1935 classic &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;, shot during her summer break. She also appeared as Cinderella in an episode of &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;, opposite Matthew Broderick. Beals was asked by Joel Schumacher to do &quot;St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire&quot; but turned it down, preferring to stay at Yale.

After graduating from Yale in 1987, Beals resumed her acting career, playing the love interest in the boxing film &quot;Split Decisions&quot; opposite Craig Sheffer. Starring opposite Nicolas Cage, she portrayed a lusty and thirsty vampire in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Vampire&#x27;s Kiss&quot;.

In 1995, Beals and Denzel Washington co-starred in &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;, a period film based on a Walter Mosley novel featuring L.A. private detective, Easy Rawlins. Beals plays a biracial woman passing for white. That same year she appeared with Tim Roth in two segments of the four-story anthology &quot;Four Rooms&quot;, one of which was directed by her then-husband, Alexandre Rockwell.

Rockwell had previously directed her in the 1992 independent film &quot;In the Soup&quot;, which was a Grand Prize winner at the Sundance Film Festival. In 2003, she played one of the sequestered jury members in the film adaptation of &quot;Runaway Jury&quot;.

She had a leading role in 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Grudge 2&quot;, sequel to the hit horror film of two years earlier. In 2010, Beals reunited with Denzel Washington in the post-apocalyptic action drama &quot;The Book of Eli&quot;, where she played a blind woman who is the mother of Mila Kunis&#x27; character and a consort of a local despot played by Gary Oldman.

Beals portrayed UCLA Bruins gymnastics head coach Valorie Kondos Field, in the film &quot;Full Out&quot;, about Ariana Berlin.

In 2017, Beals played the role of Samantha Kingston&#x27;s mother, in the film version of &quot;Before I Fall.&quot;

In 2019, she played the role of Karen in the romantic film &quot;After&quot;.

===Television===

In 1992, she appeared in &quot;2000 Malibu Road&quot; as attorney Perry Quinn. It was her first television series; she said she had been leery as she previously had not &quot;found a character I wanted to live with for several years&quot;.

In 2004, Beals made a brief cameo in the final episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;. In 2007, she appeared in the small TV drama &quot;My Name Is Sarah&quot;, in which she plays Sarah Winston, a sober woman who inadvertently walks in on an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and is mistaken for an alcoholic, but finds herself falling in love with a recovering alcoholic and—as a result—having to deal with her original deception in joining the group.

Beals starred in Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The L Word&quot;, wherein she played Bette Porter, a lesbian, Ivy League-educated, art museum director. At Beals&#x27;s request, Bette was made biracial, enabling Pam Grier&#x27;s Kit Porter character to become Bette&#x27;s half-sister. Beals&#x27;s initial research for the part focused more on the woman&#x27;s profession as an art museum director than on her life as a lesbian; &quot;I was much more obsessed by the work that Bette did, because she was so obsessed by the work that she did.&quot; The series ran for six seasons and ended in March 2009.

She also appears alongside Tim Roth in &quot;Lie to Me&quot;, as Cal Lightman&#x27;s ex-wife, Zoe Landau.

Beals was the female lead in Fox&#x27;s TV drama &quot;The Chicago Code&quot;. Her character Teresa Colvin is Chicago&#x27;s first female police superintendent. The series was canceled after its first season.

Beals turned down an offer to appear on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, saying: &quot;I am not a dancer. They asked me and I said &#x27;no.&#x27; You could back up a truck to my door filled with cash and I wouldn&#x27;t do it.&quot;

In 2013, Beals signed on for the main role of the ABC drama pilot &quot;Westside&quot; produced by McG and developed by Ilene Chaiken.

On March 10, 2014, it was announced that Beals would star as Dr. Kathryn Russo in &quot;Proof&quot;, a TNT supernatural medical drama about a hard-nosed surgeon, struggling with the loss of her teenage son, who begins to investigate that there may be life after death. The series ran from June 16 through August 18, 2015, and was produced by Kyra Sedgwick.

On February 27, 2017, Beals played the leader of a small group of specially trained government operatives for the new series &quot;Taken&quot;, which serves as a prequel to the &quot;Taken&quot; film series.

In September 2018, Beals was cast in the role of Sheriff Lucilia Cable for the &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; series.

In December 2019, Beals reprised her role as Bette Porter in &quot;The L Word: Generation Q&quot;, the sequel series to &quot;The L Word&quot;, and also executive-produces the show. She stars alongside fellow &quot;The L Word&quot; cast members, Katherine Moennig and Leisha Hailey.

In December 2021, Beals appeared in the series premiere of &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, a Disney+ series in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, where she portrays the Twi&#x27;lek Garsa Fwip.

In 2022, Beals appeared as art gallery owner Cassandra Webb in the NBC series &quot;Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime&quot; for five episodes.

===Web series===
Beals is also well known for her support of women&#x27;s rights. In August 2012, she appeared alongside Troian Bellisario in the web series &quot;Lauren&quot; on the YouTube channel WIGS. Its first season is a three-episode arc featuring the stories of women in the army being abused, predominantly by more powerful superiors. The stories focused on frequently unreported cases of sexual abuse and how and why most of the cases went unreported or unsettled. Beals has also appeared in two interviews, discussing her views in relation to &quot;Lauren&quot;.

In January 2013, Troian Bellisario confirmed on her Twitter and Instagram that she and Beals were filming more &quot;Lauren&quot; web episodes. &quot;Lauren&quot; returned on May 3, 2013, with a second season of 12 episodes.

==Personal life==
While attending Yale, Beals dated future film executive Robert Simonds. She married Alexandre Rockwell in 1986 and divorced in 1996. In 1998, she married Ken Dixon, a Canadian entrepreneur. On October 18, 2005, Beals gave birth to their daughter. Dixon also has two children from a previous marriage.

Beals has described herself as a spiritual person. She has expressed interest in the Bible and Catholicism, as well as Judaism, to which she once considered converting, and is a practicing Buddhist.

She has been a vocal advocate for gay rights, saying, &quot;I think after playing Bette Porter on &quot;The L Word&quot; for six years I felt like an honorary member of the community.&quot; Beals was a Celebrity Grand Marshal at the 2006 San Francisco Pride Parade. In October 2012, she received the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s Ally For Equality Award, in recognition of her outstanding support for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.

Beals is a practitioner of kung-fu, sanshou, and kickboxing, and is a triathlete.

Beals is a photographer and has had shows featuring her work under her married name, Dixon. In 1989, she spent some time in Haiti photographing the elections. She published a book about her time on &quot;The L Word&quot; featuring her own photographs.

In 2010, Beals served as the Grand Marshal of the McDonald&#x27;s Thanksgiving Parade in Chicago, during which she spoke of the two charities important to her: the Matthew Shepard Foundation and Pablove Foundation.

<text>Roderick Raynor Paige (born June 17, 1933) served as the 7th United States Secretary of Education from 2001 to 2005. Paige, who grew up in Mississippi, moved from college football coach and classroom teacher to college dean and school superintendent to be the first African American to serve as the U.S. education chief.

Paige was sitting with George W. Bush at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, when Bush received the news that a second plane had hit the World Trade Center in the September 11, 2001 attacks.

On November 15, 2004, Paige announced his resignation after overseeing the President&#x27;s education agenda for four years. White House domestic policy adviser Margaret Spellings was nominated as his successor. The U.S. Senate confirmed her on January 20, 2005 after Bush&#x27;s inauguration for a second term.

Paige served as interim president of his alma mater, Jackson State University, from November 2016 to June 2017.

==Early life and education==
Born in Monticello, Mississippi, Paige is the son of public school educators. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi. He earned a master&#x27;s degree and a Doctor of Education degree in Physical Education from Indiana University Bloomington.

==Career==
Paige served in the United States Navy from 1955 to 1957. Subsequently, he taught health and physical education and coached at Hinds Agricultural High School and Utica Junior College (now Hinds Community College Utica Campus) in Mississippi, from 1957 to 1963. From 1964 to 1968, Paige served as head football coach at Jackson State University, compiling a record of 25–19–2. At Jackson State, he recruited and coached Lem Barney who later played for the Detroit Lions and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. From 1971 to 1975, Paige served as head football coach at Texas Southern University, and served as the university&#x27;s athletic director from 1971 to 1980.

Paige first moved to Houston in the 1970s, settling in the Brentwood subdivision. He started a move to excise a dump from the edge of the community. The Texas Supreme Court eventually sided with the residents. Paige taught at Texas Southern University from 1980 to 1984 and became the Dean of the College of Education in 1984, where he served until 1994. Paige also established the university&#x27;s Center for Excellence in Urban Education, a research facility that concentrates on issues related to instruction and management in urban school systems.

As a trustee and an officer of the Board of Education of the Houston Independent School District (HISD) from 1989 to 1994, Paige coauthored the board&#x27;s &#x27;A Declaration of Beliefs and Visions&#x27;, a statement of purpose and goals for the school district that called for fundamental reform through decentralization, a focus on instruction, accountability at all levels, and development of a core curriculum. A Declaration of Beliefs and Visions was the catalyst that launched the ongoing, comprehensive restructuring of HISD. As an HISD trustee, Paige launched a municipal-style, accredited police department at HISD with police officers certified by the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Education. Paige&#x27;s board of education began that effort to provide better school safety, and the HISD police department remains the only school district police department in the country to earn accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.

Paige became the superintendent of schools of HISD in 1994. As superintendent, Paige created the Peer Examination, Evaluation, and Redesign (PEER) program, which solicits recommendations from business and community professionals for strengthening school support services and programs. He started a system of charter schools that have broad authority in decisions regarding staffing, textbooks, and materials. He saw to it that HISD paid teachers salaries competitive with those offered by other large Texas school districts. Paige made HISD the first school district in the state to institute performance contracts modeled on those in the private sector, whereby senior staff members&#x27; continued employment with HISD is based on their performance. He also introduced teacher incentive pay, which rewards teachers for raising test scores.

While he was superintendent, Paige led the district to enter into contracts with private schools to use them to teach some HISD students rather than placing those students into overcrowded public schools. Under Paige HISD contracted with three private schools that were certified by the Texas Education Agency to teach HISD students so their parents did not have to bus them to schools across the city.

Many touted the &quot;Houston Miracle&quot; accomplished under Paige where student test scores rose under his leadership. However, some schools underreported the number of drop-outs during his watch.

Paige served as the Secretary of Education from 2001 to 2005 under US President George W. Bush. The No Child Left Behind law that set new accountability standards nationwide was developed with Paige&#x27;s help, and it was Paige&#x27;s Department of Education that implemented the law. The Bush White House&#x27;s development of the principles of No Child Left Behind drew in part on the successes of the Houston Independent School District under Paige.

Under Paige, the department earned &quot;clean&quot; audits from Ernst and Young for three consecutive years. Prior to 2001, the department had achieved only one clean audit in its history, and that audit was by the Department&#x27;s Office of Inspector General.

Paige proposed amendments to the regulations implementing Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to provide more flexibility for educators to establish single-sex classes and schools at the elementary and secondary levels.

Paige once referred to the National Education Association, the nation&#x27;s largest teachers union, as a &quot;terrorist organization.&quot;

==Other activities==
Paige has served on review committees of the Texas Education Agency and the State Board of Education&#x27;s Task Force on High School Education, and he has chaired the Youth Employment Issues Subcommittee of the National Commission for Employment Policy of the U.S. Department of Labor. Paige is a member of the NAACP National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He is a former member of the Houston Job Training Partnership Council, the Community Advisory Board of Texas Commerce Bank, the American Leadership Forum, and the board of directors of the Texas Business and Education Coalition. He is a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. He also serves on the board of trustees for the American College of Education.

==Honors and awards==
The Houston Independent School District renamed its James Bowie Elementary School after Paige, to become Rod Paige Elementary School. The Lawrence County School District in his hometown of Monticello, Mississippi renamed its middle school Rod Paige Middle School.

The University of Houston presented Paige with an honorary doctoral degree in 2000. Indiana University Bloomington awarded Paige an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 2017.

<doc id="285196" wikidata="Q271717" url="?curid=285196" title="Gale Norton">
<text>Gale Ann Norton (born March 11, 1954) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 48th United States Secretary of the Interior under President George W. Bush from 2001 to 2006. A member of the Republican Party, she previously served as the 35th Attorney General of Colorado from 1991 to 1999. Norton was the first woman to hold each of those posts.

==Early life and education==
Norton was born in Wichita, Kansas, to Dale and Anna Norton. She was raised in Wichita and Thornton, Colorado, and graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Denver in 1975. Norton earned her Juris Doctor degree with honors from that university&#x27;s College of Law in 1978. In the late 1970s, she was a member of the Libertarian Party; she was nearly selected as its national director in 1980, before later becoming a Republican. Norton was influenced by the works of novelist Ayn Rand, and has been associated with a number of groups in the &quot;wise use&quot; or &quot;free-market environmentalist&quot; movement such as the Property and Environmental Research Center, of which she is a fellow.

==Career==
Following her graduation from law school, Norton worked as a senior attorney at the Mountain States Legal Foundation from 1979 to 1983. Norton was a National Fellow at the Hoover Institution during 1983–1984, before taking a position at the U.S. Department of Agriculture as an assistant to Deputy Secretary Richard Edmund Lyng. From 1985 to 1990, she served as Associate Solicitor for the United States Department of the Interior, in which capacity she managed attorneys employed by the National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

===Colorado Attorney General===
Norton returned to Colorado after her stint at the Department of the Interior, and was elected as the state&#x27;s first female Attorney General in 1991. As Attorney General, Norton led the state&#x27;s attorneys in defending state laws, including Colorado Amendment 2, a 1992 state constitutional amendment that prohibited any level or branch of state government from recognizing homosexuals as a protected class. Challenges to Amendment 2 reached the United States Supreme Court, which invalidated the amendment in &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot; (1996).

Norton ran for election to the U.S. Senate in 1996 as a Republican, but was defeated in the primary by then-U.S. Representative Wayne Allard. During that year, Norton delivered a controversial speech in which she remarked that while state sovereignty had been misused to defend slavery prior to and during the Civil War, with the end of the war, the United States &quot;lost the idea that the states were to stand against the federal government having too much power over our lives&quot;.

With the attorneys general of 45 other states, Norton participated in the negotiation of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (entered into in 1998) a settlement of Medicaid lawsuits by the states against U.S. tobacco companies for the recovery of public health costs attributed to the treatment of smoking-related illnesses. Norton&#x27;s second term ended in 1999. Due to state term limits, she did not seek a third term.

After leaving the Attorney General&#x27;s Office, Norton was a senior counsel at Brownstein, Hyatt &amp; Farber, a Denver-based law firm.

===U.S. Secretary of the Interior===
She worked at Brownstein until President George W. Bush nominated her as the U.S. Secretary of the Interior in 2001. Norton, the first female to hold the position, was confirmed by the Senate and served as Secretary until 2006. She was succeeded by Idaho Governor Dirk Kempthorne during the second term of the administration of George W. Bush.

On January 29, 2002, she served as the designated survivor during President Bush&#x27;s first State of the Union Address.

On September 17, 2009, the United States Department of Justice opened a criminal investigation into whether Norton&#x27;s employment at Royal Dutch Shell violated a law that bars federal employees from discussing employment with a company if the employee is involved in decisions that could benefit that company. The investigation focused on a 2006 decision by Norton&#x27;s agency to grant oil shale leases to Royal Dutch Shell. The DOJ closed the investigation in 2010, declining to press charges.

===Post-government career===
At the time of her resignation as Secretary, Norton was considered &quot;the Bush administration&#x27;s leading advocate for expanding oil and gas drilling and other industrial interests in the West.&quot; After leaving Washington, she joined Royal Dutch Shell as a general counsel in its exploration and production business.

As of 2017, Norton worked for Norton Regulatory Strategies, an Aurora-based consulting firm that deals with environmental regulations. In 2012, she also was a senior adviser for Clean Range Ventures, an energy venture capital firm. She serves as a board member for the Federalist Society, the Reagan Alumni Association, the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Institute at the University of Colorado.

<doc id="285200" wikidata="Q343047" url="?curid=285200" title="ACT UP">
<text>AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) is an international, grassroots political group working to end the AIDS pandemic. The group works to improve the lives of people with AIDS through direct action, medical research, treatment and advocacy, and working to change legislation and public policies.

ACT UP was formed on March 12, 1987, at the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in New York City. Co-founder Larry Kramer was asked to speak as part of a rotating speaker series, and his well-attended speech focused on action to fight AIDS. Kramer spoke out against the state of the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis (GMHC), which he perceived as politically impotent. Kramer had co-founded the GMHC but had resigned from its board of directors in 1983. According to Douglas Crimp, Kramer posed a question to the audience: &quot;Do we want to start a new organization devoted to political action?&quot; The answer was &quot;a resounding yes.&quot; Approximately 300 people met two days later to form ACT UP.

At the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, in October 1987, ACT UP New York made their debut on the national stage, as an active and visible presence in both the march, the main rally, and at the civil disobedience at the United States Supreme Court Building the following day. Inspired by this new approach to radical, direct action, other participants in these events returned home to multiple cities and formed local ACT UP chapters in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Rhode Island, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and other locations. ACT UP spread internationally. In many countries separate movements arose based on the American model. For example, the famous gay rights activist Rosa von Praunheim co-founded ACT UP in Germany.

==ACT UP New York actions==

Much of the documentation chronicling ACT UP&#x27;s history is drawn from Douglas Crimp&#x27;s history of ACT UP, the ACT UP Oral History Project, and the online Capsule History of ACT UP, New York.

===Wall Street===
On March 24, 1987, 250 ACT UP members demonstrated at Wall Street and Broadway to demand greater access to experimental AIDS drugs and for a coordinated national policy to fight the disease. An op-ed article by Larry Kramer published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; the previous day described some of the issues ACT UP was concerned with. Seventeen ACT UP members were arrested during this civil disobedience.

On March 24, 1988, ACT UP returned to Wall Street for a larger demonstration in which over 100 people were arrested.

On September 14, 1989, seven ACT UP members infiltrated the New York Stock Exchange and chained themselves to the VIP balcony to protest the high price of the only approved AIDS drug, AZT. The group displayed a banner that read, &quot;SELL WELLCOME&quot; referring to the pharmaceutical sponsor of AZT, Burroughs Wellcome, which had set a price of approximately $10,000 per patient per year for the drug, well out of reach of nearly all HIV positive persons. Several days following this demonstration, Burroughs Wellcome lowered the price of AZT to $6,400 per patient per year.

===General Post Office===
ACT UP held their next action at the New York City General Post Office on the night of April 15, 1987, to an audience of people filing last minute tax returns. This event also marked the beginning of the conflation of ACT UP with the Silence=Death Project, which created a poster consisting of a right side up pink triangle (an upside-down pink triangle was used to mark gays in Nazi concentration camps) on a black background with the text &quot;SILENCE = DEATH.&quot; Douglas Crimp said this demonstration showed the &quot;media savvy&quot; of ACT UP because the television media &quot;routinely do stories about down-to-the-wire tax return filers.&quot; As such, ACT UP was virtually guaranteed media coverage.

===&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine===
In January 1988, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine published an article by Robert E. Gould, a psychiatrist, entitled &quot;Reassuring News About AIDS: A Doctor Tells Why You May Not Be At Risk.&quot; The main contention of the article was that in unprotected vaginal sex between a man and a woman who both had &quot;healthy genitals&quot; the risk of HIV transmission was negligible, even if the male partner was infected. Women from ACT UP who had been having informal &quot;dyke dinners&quot; met with Gould in person, questioning him about several misleading facts (that penis to vagina transmission is impossible, for example) and questionable journalistic methods (no peer review, bibliographic information, failing to disclose that he was a psychiatrist and not a practitioner of internal medicine), and demanded a retraction and apology. When he refused, in the words of Maria Maggenti, they decided that they &quot;had to shut down Cosmo.&quot; According to those who were involved in organizing the action, it was significant in that it was the first time the women in ACT UP organized separately from the main body of the group. Additionally, filming the action itself, the preparation and the aftermath were all consciously planned and resulted in a video short directed by Jean Carlomusto and Maria Maggenti, titled, &quot;Doctor, Liars, and Women: AIDS Activists Say No To Cosmo.&quot; The action consisted of approximately 150 activists protesting in front of the Hearst Building (parent company of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;) chanting &quot;Say no to Cosmo!&quot; and holding signs with slogans such as &quot;Yes, the Cosmo Girl CAN get AIDS!&quot; Although the action did not result in any arrests, it brought significant television media attention to the controversy surrounding the article. Phil Donahue, &quot;Nightline&quot;, and a local talk show called &quot;People Are Talking&quot; all hosted discussions of the article. On the latter, two women, Chris Norwood and Denise Ribble took the stage after the host, Richard Bey, cut Norwood off during an exchange about whether heterosexual women are at risk from AIDS. 

===Women and the CDC&#x27;s AIDS Definition===
Following their participation in the Cosmopolitan protest, ACT UP&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Caucus targeted the Center for Disease Control for its narrow definition of what constituted HIV/AIDS. While causes of HIV transmission, like unprotected vaginal or anal sex, were similar among both men and women, the symptoms of the virus varied greatly. As historian Jennifer Brier noted, &quot;for men, full-blown AIDS often caused Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma, while women experienced bacterial pneumonia, pelvic inflammatory disease, and cervical cancer.&quot; Since the CDC&#x27;s definition did not account for such symptoms as a result of AIDS, American women in the 1980s were often diagnosed with AIDS Related Complex (or ARC) or HIV. &quot;In this process,&quot; Brier explained, &quot;these women effectively were denied the Social Security benefits that men with AIDS had fought hard to secure, and won, in the late 1980s.&quot;
In October 1990, attorney Theresa McGovern filed suit representing 19 New Yorkers who claimed they were unfairly denied disability benefits because of the CDC&#x27;s narrow definition of AIDS. At an October 2, 1990, protest to raise attention for McGovern&#x27;s lawsuit, two hundred ACT UP protesters gathered in Washington and chanted &quot;How many more have to die before you say they qualify,&quot; and carried posters to the rally with the tagline &quot;Women Don&#x27;t Get AIDS/ They Just Die From It.&quot;
The CDC&#x27;s initial reaction to calls of the revising the AIDS definition included setting the threshold of AIDS for both men and women at a T cell count of under 200. However, McGovern dismissed this suggestion. &quot;Lots of women who show up at hospitals don&#x27;t get T cells taken. No one knows they have HIV. I knew how many of our clients were dying of AIDS and not counted.&quot; Rather, McGovern, along with the ACLU and the New Jersey Women and AIDS Network, called for adding fifteen conditions to the list of the CDC&#x27;s surveillance case definition, which was eventually adopted in January 1993. Six months later, the Clinton administration revised federal criteria for evaluating HIV status and making it easier for women with AIDS to secure Social Security benefits. The Women&#x27;s Caucus&#x27;s role in altering the CDC&#x27;s definition helped to not only drastically increase availability of federal benefits to American women, but helped uncover a more accurate number of HIV/AIDS infected women in the United States; &quot;under the new model, the number of women with AIDS in the United States increased almost 50 percent.&quot;

Members of the ACT UP Women&#x27;s Caucus collectively authored a handbook for two teach-ins held prior to the 1989 CDC demonstration, where ACT UP members learned about issues motivating the action. The handbook, edited by Maria Maggenti, formed the basis for the ACT UP/New York Women and AIDS Book Group&#x27;s book titled Women, AIDS and Activism, edited by Cynthia Chris and Monica Pearl, and assembled by Marion Banzhaf, Kim Christensen, Alexis Danzig, Risa Denenberg, Zoe Leonard, Deb Levine, Rachel (Sam) Lurie, Catherine Saalfield (Gund), Polly Thistlethwaite, Judith Walker, and Brigitte Weil. The book was published in Spanish in 1993 titled La Mujer, el SIDA, y el Activismo. Members of the original Women and AIDS Handbook Group included Amy (Jamie) Bauer, Heidi Dorow, Ellen Neipris, Ann Northrop, Sydney Pokorney, Karen Ramspacher, Maxine Wolfe, and Brian Zabcik.

===FDA===
On October 11, 1988, ACT UP had one of its most successful demonstrations (both in terms of size and in terms of national media coverage) when it successfully shut down the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) for a day. Media reported that it was the largest such demonstration since demonstrations against the Vietnam War.

Among the protestors was artist David Wojnarowicz, then HIV/AIDS positive, wearing painted jean jacket that read: &quot;If I die of AIDS—forget burial—just drop my body on the steps of the F.D.A.&quot;— a nascent meme. At this action, and via their campaigning in general, activists demonstrated their thorough knowledge of the FDA drug approval process. ACT UP presented precise demands for changes that would make experimental drugs available more quickly, and more fairly. &quot;The success of SEIZE CONTROL OF THE FDA can perhaps best be measured by what ensued in the year following the action. Government agencies dealing with AIDS, particularly the FDA and NIH, began to listen to us, to include us in decision-making, even to ask for our input.&quot;

===&quot;Stop the Church&quot;===
ACT UP disagreed with Cardinal John Joseph O&#x27;Connor on the Roman Catholic Archdiocese&#x27;s public stand against safe sex education in New York City Public Schools, condom distribution, the Cardinal&#x27;s public condemnation of homosexuality, as well as the Church&#x27;s opposition to abortion. This led to the first Stop the Church protest on December 10, 1989, at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, New York.

Originally, the plan was just to be a &quot;die-in&quot; during the homily but it descended into &quot;pandemonium.&quot; A few dozen activists interrupted Mass, chanted slogans, blew whistles, &quot;kept up a banchee screech,&quot; chained themselves to pews, threw condoms in the air, waved their fists, and lay down in the aisles to stage a &quot;die-in.&quot; While O&#x27;Connor went on with mass, activists stood up and announced why they were protesting. One protester, &quot;in a gesture large enough for all to see,&quot; desecrated the Eucharist by spitting it out of his mouth, crumbling it into pieces, and dropping them to the floor.

One hundred and eleven protesters were arrested, including 43 inside the church. Some who refused to move had to be carried out of the church on stretchers. The protests were widely condemned by public and church officials, members of the public, the mainstream media, and some in the gay community.

===Saint Vincent&#x27;s Catholic Medical Center===

In the 1980s, as the gay population of Greenwich Village and New York began succumbing to the AIDS virus, Saint Vincent&#x27;s Catholic Medical Center established the first AIDS Ward on the East Coast and second only to one in San Francisco, and soon became &quot;Ground Zero&quot; for the AIDS-afflicted in NYC. The hospital &quot;became synonymous&quot; with care for AIDS patients in the 1980s, particularly poor gay men and drug users. It became one of the best hospitals in the state for AIDS care with a large research facility and dozens of doctors and nurses in its employ.

ACT UP protested the hospital one night in the 1980s due to its Catholic nature. They took over the emergency room and covered crucifixes with condoms. Their intent was both to raise awareness and offend Catholics. Instead of pressing charges, the sisters who ran the hospital decided to meet with the protesters to better understand their concerns.

===Storm the NIH===

On May 21, 1990, around 1000 ACT UP members initiated a choreographed demonstration at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, splitting into sub-groups across the campus. The protest was in part directed at National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and its director, Anthony Fauci. Activists were angered by what they felt was slow progress on promised research and treatment efforts. According to Kramer, this was their best demonstration, but was almost completely ignored by the media because of a large fire in Washington, D.C., on the same day.

===Day of Desperation===
On January 22, 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, ACT UP activist John Weir and two other activists entered the studio of the CBS Evening News at the beginning of the broadcast. They shouted &quot;AIDS is news. Fight AIDS, not Arabs!&quot; and Weir stepped in front of the camera before the control room cut to a commercial break. The same night ACT UP demonstrated at the studios of the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour. The next day activists displayed banners in Grand Central Terminal that said &quot;Money for AIDS, not for war&quot; and &quot;One AIDS death every 8 minutes.&quot; One of the banners was handheld and displayed across the train timetable and the other attached to bundles of balloons that lifted it up to the ceiling of the station&#x27;s enormous main room. These actions were part of a coordinated protest called &quot;Day of Desperation.&quot;

===Seattle schools===
In December 1991, ACT UP&#x27;s Seattle chapter distributed over 500 safer-sex packets outside Seattle high schools. The packets contained a pamphlet titled &quot;How to Fuck Safely,&quot; which was photographically illustrated and included two men performing fellatio. The Washington state legislature subsequently passed a &quot;Harmful to Minors&quot; law making it illegal to distribute sexually explicit material to underage persons.

===Macy&#x27;s Herald Square===
On November 29, 1991, the Black Friday shopping day, ACT UP activists dressed in Santa Claus costumes chained themselves inside Macy&#x27;s flagship Herald Square department store to protest the store&#x27;s decision not to rehire an HIV-positive Santa, Mark Woodley. They sang protest Christmas songs with lyrics such as, &quot;Santa Claus has HIV, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la/Macy&#x27;s won&#x27;t rehire he, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.&quot; Nineteen activists were arrested at the action.

==Boston and New England==
&quot;In January 1988, [ACT UP/Boston] held its first protest at the Boston offices of the Department of Health and Human Services, regarding delays and red tape surrounding approval of AIDS treatment drugs. ACT UP/Boston&#x27;s agenda included demands for a compassionate and comprehensive national policy on AIDS; a national emergency AIDS project; intensified drug testing, research, and treatment efforts; and a full-scale national educational program within reach of all. The organization held die-ins and sleep-ins, provided freshman orientation for Harvard Medical School students, negotiated successfully with a major pharmaceutical corporation, affected state and national AIDS policies, pressured health care insurers to provide coverage for people with AIDS, influenced the thinking of some of the nation&#x27;s most influential researchers, served on the Massachusetts committee that created the nation&#x27;s first online registry of clinical trials for AIDS treatments, distributed information and condoms to the congregation at Cardinal Bernard Francis Law&#x27;s Confirmation Sunday services at Holy Cross Cathedral in Boston, and made aerosolized pentamidine an accessible treatment in New England.&quot;

In February 1988 ACT UP Boston, in collaboration with ACT UP New York, Mass ACT OUT, and Cure Aids Now demonstrated at both the Democratic and Republican presidential debates and primaries in New Hampshire, and at other events during the presidential race.

During an ordination of priests in Boston in 1990, ACT UP and the Massachusetts Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights chanted and protested outside during the service. The protesters marched, chanted, blew whistles, and sounded airhorns to disrupt the ceremony. They also threw condoms at people as they left the ordination and were forced to stay back behind police and police barricades. One man was arrested. The demonstration was condemned by Leonard P. Zakim, among others.

== Los Angeles ==

ACT UP Los Angeles (ACT UP/LA) was founded December 4, 1987, and continued holding demonstrations until the early 2000s. During their run they tackled healthcare access, political issues related to LGBTQ civil rights, and supported national ACT UP campaigns.

Some of their more local work focused on policy regarding the migration of HIV-positive people into the U.S., pushing for AIDS clinical trials, promoting needle exchange programs for intravenous drug users, and surveying speaking out against discrimination by health care and insurance providers. They were effective in distributing their research on Antiviral Therapy (AZT), local and international actions, and updates on the different caucuses through their ACT UP/LA newsletter. The newsletter also served as both an educational outreach and fundraising tool.

Memorable actions by ACT UP/LA are the protests and demonstrations in county-based locations such as the USC county hospital, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, and the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. ACT UP/LA and about fifteen other organizations formed an &quot;Alternative Budget Coalition,&quot; rented the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors&#x27; meeting room, and held a mock hearing on the county&#x27;s $10+ billion budget, saying it spent too little on fighting AIDS. Prominent activists in this period included Connie Norman, one of the people who led ACT UP&#x27;s push for a bill (AB101) to protect workers from being fired because of their sexuality, California governor Pete Wilson&#x27;s veto of which led to the AB101 Veto Riot. ACT UP/LA and its associated Women&#x27;s Caucus put on a “Week of Outrage” in conjunction with the national organization, which consisted of demonstrations, a teach-in, safe-sex vending event.

===Women&#x27;s Caucus ACT UP/LA===
The Women&#x27;s Caucus (WC) of ACT UP/LA served an important collaboration between men and women who were being affected by HIV and AIDS. WC within the ACT UP/LA organization was unique because in this chapter they had a significant amount of control over how they included women&#x27;s issues into the organizations larger gay male actions. Men were present in the WC, but only as allies, which harvested a collaboration for effective actions, rallies, and any acts of resistance for the whole organization as a whole. While the collaboration was not always perfect, at the end it created a stronger force against discrimination of HIV+ people in Los Angeles.

Some of the work that the WC did was distribute statistical information about women who are HIV+, the lack of appropriate screening and health care access, information about safer sex practices (in English and Spanish), as well as acts of action to push for better. Lauren Leary was an integral in the organization because her work revolved around gathering existing research about HIV and AIDS in women and men and current treatment options. An ACT UP national collective of women came together to create the “Women&#x27;s Treatment and Research Agenda” in 1991.

==Washington D.C.==

===Giant condom over Senator&#x27;s home===
Peter Staley and other activists affiliated with ACT-UP wrapped the Arlington, Virginia home of Senator Jesse Helms in a 15-foot condom on September 5, 1991. The protest condemned the Helms AIDS Amendments, which continued to block funding for education, as well as his ongoing opposition to People With AIDS, including numerous homophobic falsehoods about HIV and AIDS. Helms had actively passed laws stigmatizing the disease, and his staunch attempts to block federal funding for, and education about, HIV and AIDS had significantly increased the death toll. Some of the harmful legislation he enacted is still in place. The condom was inflated and the message on it read: &quot;A CONDOM TO PREVENT UNSAFE POLITICS. HELMS IS DEADLIER THAN A VIRUS.&quot; The event was captured live on the news. This was the first action of the affinity ACT group TAG (Treatment Action Guerillas). While the police were called, no one was arrested, and the group was allowed to take the condom down, though they did receive a parking ticket. The event was dramatized, with fictionalized characters, in a 2019 episode of the FX television series &quot;POSE&quot;.

===Ashes Actions===
In October 1992 and October 1996, during displays of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt and just before presidential elections, ACT UP activists held two Ashes Actions. Inspired by a passage in David Wojnarowicz&#x27;s 1991 memoir &quot;Close to the Knives&quot;, these actions scattered the ashes of people who had died of AIDS, including Wojnarowicz and activist Connie Norman, on the White House lawn, in protest of the federal government&#x27;s inadequate response to AIDS.

==Canada==
=== Vancouver ===
Formed in 1989, ACT UP Vancouver began at a public meeting to determine how to respond to the government&#x27;s inaction on the AIDS crisis, and focused their activism on the provincial political crises surrounding AIDS. The first ACT UP event took place in Robson Square as a public display of art in which three mummies wrapped in linen hung upside down to depict the inaction and neglect of the provincial government on those affected by AIDS. They organized and participated in various protests, including the Les Misérables at the Queen Elizabeth Theater. They protested against the Premier of British Columbia Bill Vander Zalm who was in favor of enacting quarantine legislation (Bill 34). There was a diverse range of activist groups from the community who protested against Bill 34, there were many members from ACT UP, support from the First Nations community, and politically left-leaning people. Despite its impact, the organization eventually dissolved around 1991, following their State of the Province protest. They stated their dissolution was not due to a lack of commitment from members, but rather a lack of expertise and negative press stemming from arrests, which led to other organizations distancing themselves from ACT UP. One of the arrested members, John Kozachenko, was accused of vehicle damage, though he asserted his innocence and the charges were later dropped. Members felt the incident interfered with the groups&#x27;s ability to initiate reforms in conservative Vancouver.

=== Montreal ===
The AIDS crisis in Montreal was very pronounced and is often underrepresented in discussion about the pandemic. ACT UP worked to end the AIDS pandemic and to combat the extreme homophobia that gay men faced as a result of stigma and stereotypes. ACT UP NYC protested the Fifth International AIDS Conference in 1989 and inspired the creation of ACT UP MTL. They also confronted Montreal prisons about their high rates of HIV, which they suggested were due to condoms not being available to prisoners.

ACT UP MTL was formed in March 1990. Despite discouragement by the provincial government and Minister of Health, who felt that public information about AIDS prevention would encourage homosexuality and drug use, ACT UP MTL was responsible for translating English AIDS prevention resources into French and creating their own informational flyers that were accessible to Quebec&#x27;s Francophone population. The chapter was also responsible for several demonstrations in a Montreal city park to raise awareness about those living with AIDS and those lost to HIV/AIDS complications. In 1994, the park was officially named Le Parc de l’Espoir and an AIDS memorial monument was constructed.

=== Halifax ===
The creation of ACT UP Halifax is credited to Dan Hart, an activist and leader of the queer movement in Halifax in the 1980s who even hosted many of ACT UP&#x27;s events in his own home. While this branch of ACT UP is less known in comparison to the larger cities in the United States and Canada, it has made some notable actions during its time. On December 1st, 1990 a protest march was held on Barrington Street. What made this march different was the attendance of Pedro the Donkey, brought by the protestors to be used as a disruption method during the protest. Pedro held true to his purpose and refused to move when protesters were asked to vacate the street. This allowed Halifax&#x27;s ACT UP group to peacefully protest while staying within the confines of the law.

== England and Scotland ==

=== London ===
Formed in January 1989, by Rob Archer and Rae Trewartha, ACT UP [London] was the first ACT UP chapter in Europe.

Its first action was at Wellcome&#x27;s annual shareholder meeting, the parent company of Burroughs Wellcome, the makers of AZT, the first treatment that targeted HIV directly.

This was quickly followed by a protest at Pentonville Prison, where condoms were floated over the walls.

The next action was to highlight employment discrimination. It was at Texaco&#x27;s UK headquarters.  It was the first of a serious of protests against Texaco. They later targeted YHA employment discrimination.

The next action blocked traffic at Elephant and Castle, South London&#x27;s busiest road junction. It called on the government to end the 6 month delay for social security benefits for newly diagnosed people living with AIDS, and to improve the rate. A follow up in October, saw the first arrests in the UK. Three people were arrested including Kenny Lieske from Edinburgh ACT UP. In March 1990, members of ACT UP London chained themselves to the gates of Downing Street on budget day.

ACT UP London&#x27;s last protest was a march in Kennington on World AIDS Day (1 December 1993). This was on cuts to social security benefits for disability benefits.

The group was revived by Dan Glass in 2014. The second incarnation came about to campaign for PreP to be made freely available on the NHS. Prep is a pill that if taken regularly prevents HIV infection and transmission.

=== Edinburgh ===
Formed in October 1989, by Kenny Lieske, Rob Archer and Tim Hopkins. Edinburgh had the highest number of HIV cases in Europe, most cases being among drug users.

Edinburgh ACT UP&#x27;s first protest was on 1 December 1989, World AIDS Day  After a march along Princes Street ending in a rally where balloons were released. One black balloon was released for each person who had died in Scotland, and one white balloon for each person alive living with AIDS.

Edinburgh ACT UP&#x27;s next action was actually in London, inside Wellcome&#x27;s annual shareholders&#x27; meeting a year after ACT UP London&#x27;s protest. It got extensive positive coverage in the Scottish print media (before and after the action) and likewise with the English quality newspapers.

Edinburgh ACT UP&#x27;s most successful campaign was to change how the government funded AIDS in Scotland. The AIDS budget was poorly allocated often not spent on AIDS services at all. The campaign was to target the funding where it was most needed prioritising regions with the most people with HIV. Edinburgh ACT UP&#x27;s biggest protest blocked traffic outside of the Scottish Office. It attracted MPs and received extensive media coverage. Within a few months the government had capitulated.

=== Leeds ===
It was one of the more active chapters in the UK. It successfully changed Leeds Hospital Fund pay out policy to include people with AIDS. Other ACT UPs include Manchester, Glasgow and Norwich.

==Structure of ACT UP==

ACT UP was organized as effectively leaderless; there was a formal committee structure. Bill Bahlman recalls there were initially two main committees. There was the Issues Committee that scrupulously studied the issues surrounding an advancement the group wanted to achieve and the Actions Committee that would plan a Zap or Demonstration to achieve that particular goal. This was intentional on Larry Kramer&#x27;s part: he describes it as &quot;democratic to a fault.&quot; It followed a committee structure with each committee reporting to a coordinating committee meeting once a week. Actions and proposals were generally brought to the coordinating committee and then to the floor for a vote, but this was not required - any motion could be brought to a vote at any time. Gregg Bordowitz, an early member, said of the process:

This is how grassroots, democratic politics work. To a certain extent, this is how democratic politics is supposed to work in general. You convince people of the validity of your ideas. You have to go out there and convince people.

This is not to say that it was in practice purely anarchic or democratic. Bordowitz and others admit that certain people were able to communicate and defend their ideas more effectively than others. Although Larry Kramer is often labeled the first &quot;leader&quot; of ACT UP, as the group matured, those people that regularly attended meetings and made their voice heard became conduits through which smaller &quot;affinity groups&quot; would present and organize their ideas. Leadership changed hands frequently and suddenly.
* Some of the Committees were:
** Issues Committee
** Action Committee
** Finance Committee
** Outreach Committee
** Treatment and Data Committee
** Media Committee
** Graphics Committee
** Housing Committee
Note: As ACT UP had no formal organizing plan, the titles of these committees are somewhat variable and some members remember them differently than others.

In addition to Committees, there were also Caucuses, bodies set up by members of particular communities to create space to pursue their needs. Among those active in the late 1980s and/or early 1990s were the Women&#x27;s Caucus (sometimes referred to as the Women&#x27;s Committee) and the Latino/Latina Caucus.

Along with committees and caucuses, ACT UP New York relied heavily on &quot;affinity groups.&quot; These groups often had no formal structure, but were centered on specific advocacy issues and personal connections, often within larger committees. Affinity groups supported overall solidarity in larger, more complex political actions through the mutual support provided to members of the group. Affinity groups often organized to perform smaller actions within the scope of a larger political action, such as the &quot;Day of Desperation,&quot; when the Needle Exchange group presented NY City Health Department officials with thousands of used syringes they had collected through their exchange (contained in water cooler bottles).

=== Gran Fury ===
Gran Fury functioned as the anonymous art collective that produced all of the artistic media for ACT UP. The group remained anonymous because it allowed the collective to function as a cohesive unit without any one voice being singled out. The mission of the group was to bring an end to the AIDS Crisis by making reference to the issues plaguing society at large, especially homophobia and the lack of public investment in the AIDS epidemic, through bringing art works into the public sphere in order to reach the maximum audience. The group often faced censorship in their proceedings, including being rejected for public billboard space and being threatened with censorship in art exhibitions. When faced with this censorship, Gran Fury often posted their work illegally on the walls of the streets.

===DIVA-TV===
DIVA-TV, an acronym for &quot;Damned Interfering Video Activist Television,&quot; was an affinity group within ACT UP that videotaped and documented AIDS activism. Its founding members are Catherine Gund, Ray Navarro, Ellen Spiro, Gregg Bordowitz, Robert Beck, Costa Pappas, Jean Carlomusto, Rob Kurilla, George Plagianos. One of their early works is &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1991), documenting the 1989 ACT UP protests at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral against New York Cardinal O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s position on AIDS and contraception. In the video, Ray Navarro, an ACT UP/DIVA TV activist, serves as the narrator, dressed up as Jesus. The documentary aims to show mass media bias as it juxtaposes original protest footage with those images shown on the nightly news.

Although less as a &quot;collective&quot; after 1990, DIVA TV continued documenting (over 700 camera hours) the direct actions of ACT UP, activists, and the community responses to HIV/AIDS, producing over 160 video programs for public access television channels - as the weekly series &quot;AIDS Community Television&quot; from 1991 to 1996 and from 1994 to 96 the weekly call-in public access series &quot;ACT UP Live&quot;; film festival screenings; and continuing on-line documentation and streaming internet webcasts. The video activism of DIVA TV ultimately switched media in 1997 with the establishing and continuing development of the ACT UP (New York) website. The most recent DIVA TV-genre video program documenting the history and activism of ACT UP (New York) is the feature-length documentary: &quot;Fight Back, Fight AIDS: 15 Years of ACT UP&quot; (2002), screened at the Berlin Film Festival and exhibited worldwide. DIVA TV programs and camera-original videotapes are currently re-mastered, archived and preserved, and publicly accessible in the collection of the &quot;AIDS Video Activist Video Preservation Project&quot; at the New York Public Library.

===Institutional independence===
ACT UP had an early debate about whether to register the organization as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in order to allow contributors tax exemptions. Eventually they decided against it, because as Maria Maggenti said, &quot;they didn&#x27;t want to have anything to do with the government.&quot; This kind of uncompromising ethos characterized the group in its early stages; eventually it led to a split between those in the group who wanted to remain wholly independent and those who saw opportunities for compromise and progress by &quot;going inside [the institutions and systems they were fighting against].&quot;

==Later years==
ACT UP, while extremely prolific and certainly effective at its peak, suffered from extreme internal pressures over the direction of the group and of the AIDS crisis. After the action at NIH, these tensions resulted in an effective severing of the Action Committee and the Treatment and Data Committee, which reformed itself as the Treatment Action Group (TAG). Several members describe this as a &quot;severing of the dual nature of ACT UP.&quot;

In 2000, ACT UP/Chicago was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.

ACT UP chapters continue to meet and protest, albeit with a smaller membership. ACT UP/NY and ACT UP/Philadelphia are particularly robust, with other chapters active elsewhere. Activists from this group started giving out syringes illegally as Prevention Point Philadelphia.

Housing Works, New York&#x27;s largest AIDS service organization and Health GAP, which fights to expand treatment for people with AIDS throughout the world, are direct outgrowths of ACT UP.

==Factionalism in San Francisco==
In 2000, ACT UP/Golden Gate changed its name to Survive AIDS, to avoid confusion with ACT UP/San Francisco (ACT UP/SF). The two had previously split apart in 1990, but continued to share the same essential philosophy. In 1994, ACT UP/SF began rejecting the scientific consensus regarding the cause of AIDS and the connection to HIV, and the two groups became openly hostile to each other, with mainstream gay and AIDS organizations also condemning ACT UP/SF. ACT UP/SF would link up with People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) against animal research into AIDS cures. Restraining orders have been granted after ACT UP/SF members physically attacked AIDS charities that help HIV-positive patients, and activists associated with the chapter have been found guilty of misdemeanor charges laid after threatening phone calls to journalists and public health officials.

<text>, also written as Lupin the Third, Lupin the 3rd, or Lupin the IIIrd, is a Japanese media franchise created by Monkey Punch. The series follows the endeavors of master thief Lupin III, grandson of gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, joined by his criminal gang. The original &quot;Lupin III&quot; manga began in &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot; on August 10, 1967. 

Over fifty years after its creation, &quot;Lupin III&quot; remains popular, with a seventh anime series airing in 2021 and new ONAs released in 2023. Critical reception of the franchise has been largely positive across its various incarnations, with the appeal of the lead characters being noted as the primary factor of the series&#x27; success. The voice acting (in both Japanese and English versions) and soundtracks (especially those composed by Yuji Ohno) of the anime adaptations have also received similar compliments; however, several of the franchise&#x27;s installments, most specifically the television specials, have been criticized for being formulaic. The manga has also been noted by fans and critics for its darker tone compared to the anime, with its explicit depictions of sex and violence, as well as its dark, fourth wall-breaking sense of humor, contrasting with the mostly family-friendly animated versions. For several years, issues relating to the copyright of Maurice Leblanc&#x27;s intellectual property meant that the Lupin name was removed from its releases outside Japan, usually changed to &quot;Rupan&quot; or &quot;Wolf&quot;. However, the copyright has since expired, allowing foreign releases to use the Lupin name.

Many different companies have owned the English-language distribution rights to various &quot;Lupin III&quot; properties at various times. Tokyopop acquired the license to the original manga in 2002, and later the second series in 2004. Seven Seas Entertainment licensed manga collections in 2020. Funimation Entertainment dubbed and released several of the television specials and films from 2002 to 2006, and the fourth television series in 2013. Between 2003 and 2007, Geneon licensed and dubbed the first 79 episodes of the second television series, 26 of which were broadcast in the United States on Adult Swim in 2003 and 52 in Canada on G4techTV in 2007. Discotek Media licensed the first six television series in the franchise and the first live-action film; they also own the rights to numerous other &quot;Lupin&quot; titles, including several previously released by other companies.

==Premise==
Lupin III, the grandson of the fictional gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, is considered the world&#x27;s greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to their owners. His right-hand man and best friend is Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as a two-man team, they are often joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, and Fujiko Mine, a femme fatale and Lupin&#x27;s love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin&#x27;s interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Interpol Inspector Zenigata, who has made it his life&#x27;s work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.

==Publication history==
The series was created in 1965 by Japanese manga artist Kazuhiko Katō under the pen name Monkey Punch. His inspiration for the series was the fictional French gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, created by Maurice Leblanc. Before creating the series he read 15 of Leblanc&#x27;s stories. The aim of the &quot;Lupin III&quot; series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected the traits of Leblanc&#x27;s character. Originally the intention was to keep the blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however, he was convinced by others not to do so.

Monkey Punch combined elements of Arsène Lupin with James Bond to develop the character of Lupin III and made him a &quot;carefree fellow&quot;. Lupin was given a red color jacket which Monkey Punch believed was a flashy, sexy color.

As the series was to be published in a magazine targeted at adults, Fujiko Mine was created to add a female presence and to fulfill a &quot;Bond girl&quot; role. Her name was inspired by a picture of Mount Fuji, Monkey Punch added the -ko female suffix to create her first name, and chose &quot;Mine&quot; for her family name because of its meaning as &quot;summit&quot;. At the beginning of the series, many of the women Lupin encounters are all named Fujiko, but are treated as different characters from chapter to chapter. Creating a new female character each week was too difficult for Monkey Punch so she evolved into a single character who changes style frequently.

Jigen was based on James Coburn, especially his role in &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, and his name was chosen to reflect his unconventional personality.

Goemon was created to give a Japanese element into an otherwise Western-influenced series. Despite Lupin and Goemon originally being enemies, Monkey Punch decided that they were on the same wavelength.

While Lupin, Fujiko, Jigen and Goemon frequently operate together for their own goals, the author considered them not to be a true group as they have their own individual interests. In the manga they operated individually, but in the anime adaptations the group tend to work together.

Inspector Zenigata was conceived as Lupin&#x27;s archrival to create a &quot;human Tom and Jerry&quot;.

When Monkey Punch began &quot;Lupin III&quot;, he was already working on another series, &quot;Pinky Punky&quot;. Monkey Punch enjoyed writing outlaw characters, and both &quot;Lupin III&quot; and &quot;Pinky Punky&quot; made use of outlaws as central characters. According to him, this made it easy for him to write two series without much pressure. Monkey Punch enjoyed puzzles and mysteries such as &quot;Columbo&quot; and Agatha Christie novels, and was also inspired by &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and the movies of Alfred Hitchcock. He believed the characters of Lupin and Fujiko were similar to the characters of D&#x27;Artagnan and Milady de Winter, and described them as &quot;Not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other&quot;. Another influence on the manga was &quot;Mad&quot; magazine. Monkey Punch said the appeal of drawing Lupin comes from the character being able to go anywhere without obstacles and being able to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. However, this is contrasted by the appeal of Zenigata&#x27;s strict personality. Originally the series was only expected to last three months, but due to its popularity, Monkey Punch continued to draw it. However, despite his happiness at its success, he expressed confusion over its popularity.

Monkey Punch said that he believed the story could never end but that if it had to, both Zenigata and Lupin would have to end as equals. They would either both fail, both win, or both get very old.

==Copyright issues==

Monkey Punch did not ask permission to use the Arsène Lupin name and at the time Japan did not enforce trade copyrights. By the time Leblanc&#x27;s estate launched legal action in Japan, the name was considered to have entered into common use. However, this was not the case in North America and Europe, and several foreign releases of &quot;Lupin III&quot; media dropped the &quot;Lupin III&quot; title and the character himself was renamed to &quot;Rupan&quot; or &quot;Wolf&quot;. In France, the series was known as &quot;Edgar, Detective Cambrioleur&quot; (Edgar, Detective Burglar) with Lupin himself renamed &quot;Edgar de la Cambriole&quot; (Edgar of Burglary). Monkey Punch stated that using the same character design, behavior, and face would be illegal, but using a name alone is not illegal. In 2012, Leblanc&#x27;s original Arsène Lupin entered the public domain in France due to 70 years passing since his death in 1941, and is in the public domain for any country that enforces the rule of the shorter term.

Tokyopop later cancelled the series due to low sales. Like the first series, the Tokyopop release was based on the Chuokoron Shinsha edition from 1990.

Adapting the manga into animation was first suggested by animator Gisaburō Sugii to Yutaka Fujioka, the founder of TMS Entertainment.

==Reception==
The &quot;Lupin III&quot; franchise has experienced lasting popularity in Japan; the manga was listed in 38th place on Japan&#x27;s Agency for Cultural Affairs&#x27; 2007 list of the top 50 manga series. In 2000, satellite TV channel Animax together with &quot;Brutus&quot;, a men&#x27;s lifestyle magazine, and Tsutaya, Japan&#x27;s largest video rental chain, conducted a poll among 200,000 fans on the top anime series, with &quot;Lupin III&quot; coming in second. TV Asahi conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime, &quot;Lupin III&quot; came in fifth in the nationwide survey conducted with multiple age-groups and in twelfth in the online poll. &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; was in fifth place on Agency for Cultural Affairs&#x27; list of the best anime, while the original television series was in 50th place on the same list. In 2001, the magazine &quot;Animage&quot; elected the original &quot;Lupin III&quot; TV series the ninth best anime production of all time. In 2012, 38.7% of people polled by Tokyo Polytechnic University named &quot;Lupin III&quot; as part of Cool Japan.

In &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson referred to Monkey Punch&#x27;s original manga as &quot;a crazy, groovy 1960s world of dynamite and backstabbing, hippies and gangsters&quot;, and considered it &quot;a fascinating homage to &quot;Mad&quot; magazine and a four star example of comics as pure comedy.&quot; He rated the series four out of four stars. Allen Divers of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; (ANN) praised the strong writing and action; however, he felt that the art was too primitive. &quot;Otaku USA&quot;″s Daryl Surat was also put off by the art, saying he couldn&#x27;t tell most characters apart and had a hard time figuring out what he was looking at. In &quot;The Rough Guide to Manga&quot;, Jason S. Yadao highlighted the example of how Lupin wearing a hat looks exactly like Zenigata. However, he considered it a successful plot device in once chapter that while it may take several attempts to understand, eventually pays off. He included the series in his list of 50 essential manga. Many of the first volumes of the English edition of the &quot;Lupin III&quot; manga released by Tokyopop made it onto ICv2&#x27;s list of top 50 graphic novels, as well as later volumes from the series.

In &quot;Anime Classics Zettai!&quot;, Brian Clamp and Julie Davis compare the first two anime adaptions. They note that the first series is of a serious style, closer to the original manga with a dark tone and that it focuses on disputes between Lupin and other criminals. In contrast they sum up the second series as a &quot;caper comedy&quot; with a more comedic tone and style. Both Chris Beveridge of Mania.com and Mike Crandol of ANN disliked the dub of the second television series because Pioneer Entertainment used many modern references and updated dialogue for a series that was released in the late 1970s, although the series itself received a positive overall review from both reviewers. Rob Lineberger of DVD Verdict wrote, &quot;&quot;Lupin the Third&quot; is &quot;James Bond&quot; meets &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; with &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; sensibilities.&quot; Monkey Punch believes that the voice work of Yasuo Yamada was a large reason for the popularity of the anime series.

Chris Beveridge of Mania.com gave &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; an &quot;A+&quot;, although he disliked Manga Entertainment&#x27;s use of PG-13 level language in the English dub. While the film was not initially a box-office success, it gained popularity through numerous re-releases and was even voted as &quot;the best anime in history&quot; by the readers of &quot;Animage&quot;. The film was the best-selling anime DVD in May 2001, and the third best selling in June. Some fans maintain that it is not a &quot;true&quot; Lupin title, due to Miyazaki&#x27;s altering of the titular character into a family-friendly hero, rather than his original ruthless criminal self. While admitting that &quot;Cagliostro&quot; is the most well-known, ANN&#x27;s Mike Crandol cited &quot;The Fuma Conspiracy&quot; as the best Lupin animation.

The &quot;Lupin III&quot; television specials released by Funimation have received reviews varying from positive to mixed. The most well-received seems to be &quot;Island of Assassins&quot;, with Chris Beveridge of Mania.com describing it as &quot;the best non-TV Lupin experience ... since &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot;&quot;, &quot;Missed by a Dollar&quot; received an eight out of ten rating by IGN&#x27;s Jeremy Mullin, who stated it starts off as seemingly a simple heist film, but turns out to have plenty of twists. The least well-received of Funimation&#x27;s releases is &quot;Secret of the Twilight Gemini&quot;, which received mixed reviews due to the animation and its B movie-style plot. Mania.com gave 2002&#x27;s &quot;Episode 0: First Contact&quot; an A+ and hailed it as the best TV special made to date. In &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies&quot; Helen McCarthy called &quot;Liberty&quot; her personal favourite of the Lupin TV specials. She describes it as &quot;light, funny and entertaining&quot; and &quot;terrific entertainment&quot;.

Critical reception of the 2014 live-action film was generally negative among Japanese and Western film critics, especially following the film&#x27;s showing at LA EigaFest. Areas frequently targeted for criticism were Ryuhei Kitamura&#x27;s direction, the film&#x27;s supporting characters, screenplay, cinematography and editing (especially in the action scenes), costume design and soundtrack. The film was also criticized for having most of its dialogue performed in English (resulting in poor delivery and intonation of numerous lines by its Asian cast members), and for overall squandering its potential as an adaptation of Monkey Punch&#x27;s manga. Shun Oguri, Tetsuji Tamayama, Gō Ayano, Meisa Kuroki and Tadanobu Asano were, however, frequently seen as well-cast in their respective roles. Audience opinions were mixed, with some viewing the film as “an enjoyable time to be had to the whole family”, while others viewed it as part of a “terrible live-action adaptation trend that has been going on through the years”.

Writing for &quot;The Fandom Post&quot;, Beveridge praised the &quot;Lupin Zero&quot; original net animation as a &quot;thoroughly enjoyable experience&quot; that has the hallmarks of the original manga with actual violence and blood and &quot;lightly pervy&quot; moments. Giving the series an &quot;A&quot; rating, he also praised the relationship between Lupin and Jigen. Gunawan of &quot;Anime News Network&quot; described the relationship between the two characters as reminiscent of classic buddy cop films, and also gave the six-episode series an &quot;A&quot; rating. They praised the &quot;simple and engaging&quot; story and action scenes, but noted some viewers might not enjoy the retro art style, although they personally did.

==Legacy==
&quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; and &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot; director Shinichirō Watanabe revealed during an interview with &quot;Newtype Japan&quot; that he was heavily influenced by the work of director Masaaki Ōsumi on the first Lupin television series. Animator Akihiro Kanayama has cited the animation of the anime adaption as an inspiration. 
Numerous anime series have made reference to the series including &quot;Magical Princess Minky Momo&quot;, &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;Gunbuster&quot;, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, &quot;Here is Greenwood&quot; and &quot;FLCL&quot;. Video game designer Hideo Kojima compared the personality of Lupin with Solid Snake in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, stating that in &quot;&quot;MGS&quot;, Snake became this sharp-tongued, Lupin III-like guy who flirted with women and told lots of jokes&quot;. Kojima would also partially base his character EVA on Fujiko Mine. 

On March 30, 1984, the series was the last animated work to be featured on the cover of the Japanese &quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine before the implementation of a policy limiting the cover to live action images. In 2006, Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Touch the Sky&quot; featured rapper Lupe Fiasco referencing Lupin III. 
In 2008, the &quot;Lupin III&quot;-themed attraction &quot;Lupin III: Labyrinth Trap&quot;, which has visitors track down treasure in a maze-like layout, opened at the Tokyo Dome City Attractions amusement park.

In 2009, Japanese-Canadian rock band Monkey Majik created an animated music video in which its members meet the &quot;Lupin III&quot; cast. The video, which is set to the band&#x27;s version of the anime&#x27;s theme song, promoted the &quot;Lupin the Third Dance &amp; Drive official covers &amp; remixes&quot; CD. A campaign titled &quot;Lupin Steal Japan&quot; was launched that same year by NTV, TMS Entertainment, Namco Bandai Games, and Heiwa — a manufacturer of pachinko machines. The project&#x27;s website took suggestions on real-life objects for Lupin to steal. One such example is the Moyai statue in Shibuya, which was taken elsewhere for cleaning on December 7, but was replaced by the calling card of the master thief that read &quot;Thanks for the Moyai&quot;.

In celebration of the anime&#x27;s 40th anniversary, the &quot;This is the World of Lupin III&quot; event was held at the Matsuya store in Ginza. From August 10 to August 22, 2011, over 300 items related to &quot;Lupin III&quot; were exhibited, including original manuscripts by Monkey Punch and animation cels from the feature films. The following year a similar exhibit was held at the Kitakyushu museum from November 3 to December 28, and another at the Kawasaki City Museum from October until November 10, 2013. The exhibit then moved to Aomori&#x27;s Sunroad shopping centre from December 21, 2013, until January 21, 2014.

In 2012, the Hokkaido Railway Company unveiled &quot;Lupin III&quot;–themed trains on their Hanasaki Line between Kushiro and Nemuro station, in honor of Monkey Punch, who is a native of Hokkaido. The train was originally to run until March 2015, but was then extended until March 2017. From April 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015, the city of Sakura in Chiba prefecture began accepting applications for Lupin III motorcycle and minicar license plates. Monkey Punch was a resident of the city (until his death in 2019) and the plates were commissioned for the 60th anniversary of being awarded city status. The plates were limited to 3,000 across four categories, with 2,500 plates reserved for 50 cc vehicles. In 2017, one of the fish in the American television series &quot;FishCenter Live&quot; was named Lupin the Third.

<doc id="285205" wikidata="Q1353155" url="?curid=285205" title="Seven dirty words">
<text>The seven dirty words are seven English language profanity words that American comedian George Carlin first listed in his 1972 &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&quot; monologue. The words, in the order Carlin listed them, are: &quot;shit&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;cunt&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;motherfucker&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. 

These words were considered highly inappropriate and unsuitable for broadcast on the public airwaves in the United States, whether radio or television. As such, they were avoided in scripted material and bleep censored in the rare cases in which they were used. Broadcast standards differ in different parts of the world, then and now, although most of the words on Carlin&#x27;s original list remain taboo on American broadcast television. The list was not an official enumeration of forbidden words, but rather were concocted by Carlin to flow better in a comedy routine. Nonetheless, a radio broadcast featuring these words led to a Supreme Court 5–4 decision in 1978 in &quot;FCC v. Pacifica Foundation&quot; that the FCC&#x27;s declaratory ruling did not violate either the First or Fifth Amendments, thus helping define the extent to which the federal government could regulate speech on broadcast television and radio in the United States.

==Background==
During a performance in 1966, comedian Lenny Bruce said he had been arrested for saying nine words: &quot;ass&quot;, &quot;balls&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;cunt&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;motherfucker&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;shit&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. In 1972, comedian George Carlin released his fourth stand-up album &quot;Class Clown&quot;. One track on the album, &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&quot;, was a monologue in which he identified these words and expressed amazement that they could not be used regardless of context. In a 2004 NPR interview, he said:

Carlin was arrested for disturbing the peace when he performed the routine at a show at Summerfest in Milwaukee in 1972. On his next album, 1973&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, he performed a similar routine titled &quot;Filthy Words&quot;, dealing with the same list and many of the same themes. Pacifica station WBAI broadcast this version of the routine uncensored on October 30 that year.

==&quot;Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation&quot;==

In 1973 John Douglas, an active member of Morality in Media, claimed that he heard the WBAI broadcast while driving with his then 15-year-old son, Dean, and complained to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that the material was inappropriate for the time of day (approximately 2:00 p.m.).

Following the lodging of the complaint, the FCC proceeded to ask Pacifica for a response, then issued a declaratory order upholding the complaint. No specific sanctions were included in the order, but WBAI was put on notice that &quot;in the event subsequent complaints are received, the Commission will then decide whether it should utilize any of the available sanctions it has been granted by Congress&quot;. WBAI appealed against this declaratory ruling, and the ruling was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in a 2–1 decision on the grounds that the FCC&#x27;s definition of &quot;indecency&quot; was overbroad and vague and thus violated the First Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of free speech. The FCC in turn appealed to the Supreme Court. As an independent federal agency, the FCC filed the appeal in its own name. The United States Department of Justice intervened in the case, supporting Pacifica&#x27;s argument that the FCC&#x27;s declaratory ruling violated the First Amendment and that it also violated the Fifth Amendment in that the FCC&#x27;s definition of &quot;indecency&quot; was too vague to support criminal penalties.

In 1978, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, ruled that the FCC&#x27;s declaratory ruling did not violate either the First or Fifth Amendments, but it limited the scope of its decision to the specific broadcast that caused the declaratory ruling and declined to consider whether the FCC&#x27;s definition of indecency would survive a First Amendment challenge if applied to the broadcast of other material containing the same or similar words which had been cited in Pacifica&#x27;s brief (e.g., works of Shakespeare – &quot;pissing conduits&quot;, &quot;bawdy hand of the dial on the prick of noon&quot;; the Bible – &quot;he who pisseth against the wall&quot;; the Watergate Tapes). It noted that while the declaratory ruling pertained to the meaning of the term &quot;indecency&quot; as used in a criminal statute (18 USC 1464), since the FCC had not imposed any penalty on Pacifica, the Court did not need to reach the question as to whether the definition was too vague to satisfy the due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment.

This decision formally established indecency regulation in American broadcasting. In follow-up rulings, the Supreme Court established the safe harbor provision that grants broadcasters the right to broadcast indecent (but not obscene) material between the hours of 10 pm and 6 am, when it is presumed few children would be watching. The FCC has never maintained a specific list of words prohibited from the airwaves during the time period from 6 am to 10 pm.

The seven dirty words have been assumed to be likely to elicit indecency-related action by the FCC if uttered on a TV or radio broadcast, and thus the broadcast networks generally censor themselves with regard to many of the seven dirty words. The FCC regulations regarding &quot;fleeting&quot; use of expletives were ruled unconstitutionally vague by a three-judge panel of the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on July 13, 2010, as they violated the First Amendment due to their possible effects regarding free speech.
==The words==

The original seven words named by Carlin are:
# shit
# piss
# fuck
# cunt
# cocksucker
# motherfucker
# tits
In subsequent routines, Carlin would frequently deconstruct the list, proposing additions or deletions based on audience feedback, or sometimes on his own whims. For example, a man asked him to remove &quot;motherfucker&quot; because, as a derivative of &quot;fuck&quot;, it constituted a duplication: &quot;He says &quot;motherfucker&quot; is a duplication of the word &quot;fuck&quot;, technically, because &quot;fuck&quot; is the root form, &quot;motherfucker&quot; being derivative; therefore, it constitutes duplication. And I said, &#x27;Hey, &quot;motherfucker&quot;, how did you get my phone number, anyway?

He later added it back, claiming the bit&#x27;s rhythm does not work without it. In his comedy routine, Carlin would make fun of each word; for example, he would say that &quot;tits&quot; should not be on the list because it sounds like a nickname (&quot;Hey, Tits, c&#x27;mere!&quot;) or the name of a snack food (&quot;New Nabisco Tits! ... corn tits, cheese tits, tater tits!&quot;).

A follow-up routine, titled &quot;Filthy Words&quot; (featured on his album &quot;&quot;) sees Carlin revisiting the original list and admitting that it is not complete, proceeding to add the words &quot;fart&quot;, &quot;turd&quot;, and &quot;twat&quot; to the list. He brings this up again in another follow-up routine, &quot;Dirty Words&quot; (featured in &quot;George Carlin: Again!&quot;), still feeling the list was not yet complete, and assures the audience: &quot;Some of your favorites might make the list this year!&quot;

==Availability==
Carlin performed the routine many times and included it, in whole or in part, on several of his records and HBO specials. Parts or all of the performance appear on the following releases:
* 1972 – &quot;Class Clown&quot; – Audio recording – &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&quot;
* 1973 – &quot;&quot; – Audio recording – &quot;Filthy Words&quot;
* 1977 – &quot;George Carlin at USC&quot; – HBO special – &quot;Forbidden Words&quot;
* 1978 – &quot;George Carlin: Again!&quot; – HBO special – &quot;Dirty Words&quot;
* 1983 – &quot;Carlin at Carnegie&quot; – HBO special – &quot;Filthy Words&quot;

The &quot;Carlin at Carnegie&quot; version can be heard as &quot;An Incomplete List of Impolite Words&quot; on the 1984 album &quot;Carlin on Campus&quot; (but not in the HBO special, &quot;Carlin on Campus&quot;). That version of the list features over 300 dirty words and phrases in an effort to stop people telling him that he left something off the list. Four days after Carlin&#x27;s original &quot;Class Clown&quot; recording, the routine was performed again for students at the University of California, Los Angeles. This would be months before its first official release. The recording was restored in December, 2013 and uploaded to YouTube by archivists at UCLA and could be accessed free of charge, but is no longer available due to a claim of copyright infringement.
The FCC ruling is referenced in &quot;Offensive Language&quot; from the album &quot;Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics&quot; and HBO special &quot;Doin&#x27; It Again&quot;, both 1990 recordings of the same performance; however, the routine that follows is entirely different.

The &quot;Class Clown&quot; version can also be heard on the vinyl/cassette only release &quot;Indecent Exposure&quot; (1978). The &quot;Occupation: Foole&quot; version can also be heard on &quot;Classic Gold&quot; (1992). Both versions were re-released again as part of &quot;The Little David Years (1971–1977)&quot;.

==H.R. 3687==
U2 singer Bono said on live television that his 2003 Golden Globe Award was &quot;really, really fucking brilliant!&quot; Despite complaints, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did not fine the network. In apparent reaction, on December 8, 2003, Rep. Doug Ose (R-California) introduced H.R. 3687, the &quot;Clean Airwaves Act&quot;, in Congress to designate a derivative list of Carlin&#x27;s offensive words as profane in the U.S. Code. The stated purpose of the bill was &quot;To amend , to provide for the punishment of certain profane broadcasts.&quot; In the text of the bill, the words &quot;shit&quot;, &quot;piss&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;cunt&quot;, &quot;asshole&quot;, and the phrases &quot;cock sucker&quot;, &quot;mother fucker&quot;, and &quot;ass hole&quot; are specifically listed. The bill was not enacted.

==Subscription services==
The FCC obscenity guidelines do not apply to non-broadcast media such as cable television, satellite TV, or satellite radio. Whether the FCC or the Department of Justice could be empowered by the Congress to restrict indecent content on cable television without such legislation violating the Constitution has never been settled by a court of law. Since cable television must be subscribed to in order to receive it legally, subscribers who object to the content being delivered may cancel their subscription, an incentive is created for the cable operators to self-regulate (unlike broadcast television, cable television is not legally considered to be &quot;pervasive&quot;, nor does it depend on a scarce, government-allocated electromagnetic spectrum; as such, neither of the arguments buttressing the case for broadcast regulation particularly apply to cable television).

Self-regulation by many basic cable networks is undertaken by Standards and Practices (S&amp;P) departments that self-censor their programming because of the pressure put on them by advertisers – also meaning that any basic cable network willing to ignore such pressure could use any of the Seven Dirty Words. All of the words on Carlin&#x27;s list have come into common usage in many made-for-cable series and film productions.

<text>Monrovia () is the administrative capital and largest city of Liberia. Founded in 1822, it is located on Cape Mesurado on the Atlantic coast and as of the 2022 census had 1,761,032 residents, home to 33.5% of Liberia’s total population. Its largely urbanized metro area, including Montserrado and Margibi counties, was home to 2,225,911 inhabitants as of the 2022 census. 

As the nation&#x27;s primary city, Monrovia is the country&#x27;s economic, financial and cultural center; its economy is primarily centered on its harbor and its role as the seat of Liberian government. The city&#x27;s economy is largely based on its position as chief Atlantic port of Liberia, with the Freeport of Monrovia based in the city being the largest and main port in the country.

The land in which the city resides was traditionally the land of the Vai People, a West African ethnic group. It was founded on April 5, 1822, by members of the American Colonization Society (ACS) as an organization to return former slaves born in the United States to Africa.

==Etymology==
Monrovia is named in honor of U.S. President James Monroe, a prominent supporter of the colonization of Liberia and the ACS. Along with Washington, D.C., it is one of two world capitals to be named after a U.S. President. The original name of Monrovia was Christopolis before being changed to its current name in 1824, only two years after the city&#x27;s founding. The &quot;-via&quot; suffix comes from either the West African Edoidi-Beninese religious deity Ovia symbolizing peace and prosperity or the folk mythological character Ovia of the Uhen tribe, famed for her great beauty and unwavering principles, marrying the King of the Oyo Empire.

==History==

Before 1816, the area around Cape Mesurado and the mouth of the Mesurado River was called Ducor. It had long been established as a crossroads and a place of trade inhabited by fishing, trading and farming communities of various ethnicities, including the Dey, Kru, Bassa, Gola, and Vai. The French cartographer and slave trader Chevalier des Marchais visited Ducor and the Cape in 1723, conducted business there and later published a map of the area.

In 1816, with the aim of establishing a self-sufficient colony for emancipated American slaves, something that had already been accomplished in Freetown, the first group of African American settlers arrived in West Africa from the United States under the auspices of the American Colonization Society and with the support of the U.S. government. They landed on Sherbro Island, part of modern-day Sierra Leone.

On January 7, 1822, a ship took these settlers to Dazoe Island (now called Providence Island) at the mouth of the Mesurado River. They subsequently went ashore at Cape Mesurado, and established a settlement they called &quot;Christopolis&quot;.
In 1824, the city was renamed &quot;Monrovia&quot; after James Monroe, president of the United States at the time. Monroe was a prominent supporter of developing the city as a place to relocate formerly enslaved Black people from the United States of America and Caribbean islands, an idea put forth as an alternative to abolishing the institution of slavery in America.

In 1845 there was a constitutional convention in Monrovia, at this convention a document was drafted that would be adopted two years later as the constitution of the newly independent and sovereign Republic of Liberia.

At the beginning of the 20th century 2,500 of Monrovia’s 4,000 residents were Americo-Liberian. At that time Monrovia consisted of two sectors: Monrovia proper and Krutown. The city&#x27;s Americo-Liberian population resided in the former sector. Because of American settlers&#x27; influence the architectural style of its buildings was reminiscent of that of the southern United States. Krutown was inhabited mainly by ethnic Krus, but also by Bassas, Grebos and members of other ethnic groups. By 1926 ethnic groups from Liberia&#x27;s interior began to migrate outwards toward Monrovia in search of jobs. By 1937 Monrovia’s population had grown to 10,000. At this time the town had 30 police officers.

In 1979 the Organisation of African Unity, chaired by the then president of Liberia, William Tolbert, held its conference near Monrovia. During his term, Tolbert improved public housing in Monrovia and slashed tuition fees at the University of Liberia in half. In 1980 a military coup led by Samuel Doe overthrew the Tolbert government and executed many of its members. Tolbert, and others who were killed in the coup, were buried in a mass grave in Palm Grove Cemetery.

The First Liberian Civil War (1989 to 1997) and Second Liberian Civil War (1999 to 2003) severely damaged the infrastructure of the city. Much of the damage occurred during the siege of Monrovia. Major battles included clashes between Samuel Doe&#x27;s government forces and Prince Johnson&#x27;s forces in 1990 and the National Patriotic Front of Liberia&#x27;s assault on the city in 1992. During these wars young children and youth, deprived of resources and schooling, were forced to involve themselves in the fighting. Afterwards, many of them were left homeless.

In 2002 Leymah Gbowee organized the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace, a group consisting of local Monrovian women, who gathered in a fish market to pray and sing. This movement helped to end the war the following year and to bring about the election of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf as president of Liberia, which made it the first African nation to have a female president.

In 2014 the city was affected by the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak. The Ebola virus epidemic in Liberia was declared to be over on 3 September 2015.

==Geography==
Monrovia lies along the Cape Mesurado peninsula, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mesurado River, whose mouth forms a large natural harbor. The Saint Paul River lies directly north of the city and forms the northern boundary of Bushrod Island, which is reached by crossing the &quot;New Bridge&quot; from downtown Monrovia. Monrovia is located in Montserrado County and is Liberia&#x27;s largest city as its administrative, commercial and financial center.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Monrovia&#x27;s climate is classified as a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;). It is the wettest capital city in the world, with annual rainfall averaging . It has a wet season and a dry season but gets precipitation even during the dry season. Temperatures are fairly constant throughout the year, averaging around . The only slight variations are in the high temperatures, which are around in the winter and near in the summer. Lows are usually between year-round.
===Neighborhoods===
Monrovia comprises several districts spread across the Mesurado peninsula; the greater metropolitan area encircles the mouth of the marshy Mesurado River. The historic downtown area, centered on Broad Street, is at the very end of the peninsula; the major market district, Waterside, immediately to its north, faces the city&#x27;s large natural harbor.

Northwest of Waterside is the large, low-income West Point community. To the west and southwest of the downtown area is Mamba Point, traditionally the city&#x27;s principal diplomatic quarter and home to the embassies of the United States and United Kingdom, as well as the European Union delegation. South of the city center is Capitol Hill, where the major institutions of the national government, including the Temple of Justice and the Executive Mansion, are located.

Further east along the peninsula is the Sinkor section of Monrovia. Originally a suburban residential district, today Sinkor is the bustling midtown section of the city. It includes many diplomatic missions, major hotels, businesses, and residential neighborhoods, including informal communities such as Plumkor, Jorkpentown, Lakpazee and Fiamah.
Sinkor is also home to the city&#x27;s secondary airport, Spriggs Payne, and the area immediately next to the airport, called Airfield, is a major nightlife district for the whole city. East of the Airfield is the Old Road section of Sinkor, which is predominantly residential, and includes informal settlements such as Chugbor and Gaye Town.

At the southeastern base of the peninsula is the independent township of Congo Town, and to its east is the large suburb of Paynesville. Other suburbs, such as Chocolate City, Gardnersville, Barnesville, Kaba Town, Dandawailo, and New Georgia lie to the north, across the river. On Bushrod Island, north of Monrovia, are the neighborhoods of Clara Town, Logan Town and New Kru Town. To the far east are the suburbs of Stockton Creek Bridge, Caldwell, Louisiana, and Cassava Hill.

==Economy==

Monrovia&#x27;s economy is dominated by its harbor - the Freeport of Monrovia - and as the location of Liberia&#x27;s government offices. Monrovia&#x27;s harbor was significantly expanded by U.S. forces during the Second World War and the main exports include latex and iron ore.

Materials are also manufactured on-site, such as cement, refined petroleum, food products, brick and tile, furniture, and chemicals. Located on Bushrod Island between the mouths of the Mesurado and Saint Paul rivers, the harbor also has facilities for storing and repairing vessels.

==Transport==
Boats link the city&#x27;s Freeport of Monrovia, the country&#x27;s busiest port, with Greenville and Harper. The nearest airport is Spriggs Payne Airport, located less than four miles () from the city center. Roberts International Airport, the largest international airport in Liberia, is away in Harbel.

Monrovia is connected with the rest of the country via a network of roads and railways. Monrovia is listed as the home port by between ten and fifteen percent of the world&#x27;s merchant shipping, registered in Liberia under Flag of Convenience arrangements. Both private taxis and minibuses run in the city, and are supplemented by larger buses run by the Monrovia Transit Authority.

In recent years (2005–present) the roads on many streets in Monrovia have been rebuilt by the World Bank and the Liberian Government. Private and public infrastructures are being built or renovated as reconstruction takes place.

==Administration and government==

Monrovia is situated in the district of Greater Monrovia in Montserrado County. Instead of being divided into clans like other districts of Liberia, Greater Monrovia is divided into 16 &quot;zones&quot;. Like clans, these zones are subdivided into 161 communities. Greater Monrovia does not have an organized district administration like other districts, with all lower-level local authorities being directly supervised by the Montserrado County Superintendent. Municipally, Greater Monrovia District is subdivided into two city corporations and ten other local authorities (nine townships and one borough). Established by law in 1973 and operational since 1976, the Monrovia City Corporation (MCC) is responsible for the city&#x27;s administration. The MCC also provides services to the townships and borough through a revenue-sharing arrangement, but has no zoning or enforcement jurisdiction in them.

==Culture and media==

Cultural attractions in Monrovia include the Liberian National Museum, the Masonic Temple, the Waterside Market, and several beaches. The city also houses Antoinette Tubman Stadium and the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex, with seats for 22,000.

The newspaper industry in Monrovia dates back to the 1820s, with the founding of the &quot;Liberia Herald&quot;, one of the first newspapers to be published in Africa. Today, numerous tabloid-style newspapers are printed daily or bi-weekly, most are 20 pages or less. The &quot;Daily Talk&quot; is a compilation of news and Bible quotations written daily on a roadside blackboard in the Sinkor section of Monrovia.

Monrovia also has radio and TV stations. Radio is the dominant source of news, because problems with the electric grid make watching television more difficult. UNMIL Radio has been broadcasting since October 1, 2003, and is the only radio station in Liberia that is on the air 24 hours a day. It reaches an estimated of the population. The state-owned Liberia Broadcasting System broadcasts nationwide from its headquarters in Monrovia. STAR radio broadcasts at 104 FM.

==Education==
Monrovia is home to the University of Liberia, along with African Methodist Episcopal University, United Methodist University, Stella Maris Polytechnic, and many other public and private schools. Medical education is offered at the A.M. Dogliotti College of Medicine, and there is a nursing and paramedical school at the Tubman National Institute of Medical Arts.

Kindergarten through twelfth grade education is provided by the Monrovia Consolidated School System, which serves the greater Monrovia area. Schools include Monrovia Central High School, Bostwain High School, D. Twe High School, G. W. Gibson High School and William V. S. Tubman High School.

The American International School of Monrovia is located in Congo Town.

== Places of worship == 
The places of worship in Monrovia are predominantly Christian churches and temples. These include the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Monrovia (Catholic Church), the United Methodist Church in Liberia (World Methodist Council), the Liberia Baptist Missionary and Educational convention (Baptist World Alliance) and the Assemblies of God. In October 2021, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints announced plans to construct a temple in Monrovia. The city also has Muslim mosques.

==Pollution==

Pollution is a significant challenge in Monrovia. Piles of household and industrial rubbish tend to build up. The World Bank pays sanitation companies to collect it, but collections are irregular.

In 2013, the problem of uncollected rubbish in the Paynesville area of Monrovia became so acute that traders and residents burnt &quot;the huge garbage piles that seemed on the verge of cutting off the main road&quot; out of Monrovia to Kakata.

Flooding brings additional environmental problems to residents: flood water picks up the waste that has been deposited in swamps at the edge of residential areas, and spreads it around.

In 2009, only one-third of Monrovia&#x27;s 1.5 million people had access to clean toilets. Those without their own toilets defecate in the narrow alleyways between their houses, or on the beach, or into plastic bags that they dump onto nearby piles of rubbish or into the sea.

Congested housing, a lack of any requirement that landlords provide working toilets, and virtually no urban planning &quot;have combined to create lethal sanitation conditions in the capital&quot;.

<text>Raqs sharqi (, ; literally &quot;oriental dancing&quot;) is the classical Egyptian style of belly dance that developed during the first half of the 20th century.

==History==
Raqs sharqi was developed by Taheyya Kariokka, Samia Gamal, Naima Akef, Zeinat Olwi, and other dancers who rose to fame during the golden years of the Egyptian film industry. This has come to be considered the classical style of dance in Egypt by the 1950s. These dancers were famous not only for their role in Egyptian films, but also for their performances at the &quot;Opera Casino&quot; opened in 1925 by Badia Masabni. This venue was a popular place for influential musicians and choreographers from both the US and Europe, so many of the developments pioneered here can be considered new developments in the dance.

Later dancers who were influenced by these artists are Soheir Zaki, Nagwa Fouad, Fifi Abdou, and Dalilah. All rose to fame between 1960 and 1980, and are still popular today. And later generations, such as Dina, some of these later dancers were the first to choreograph and perform dances using a full &#x27;orchestra&#x27; and stage set-up, which had a huge influence upon what is considered the &#x27;classical&#x27; style.

Though the basic movements of raqs sharqi are unchanged, the dance form continues to evolve. Nelly Mazloum and Mahmoud Reda are noted for incorporating elements of ballet, and their influence can be seen in modern Egyptian dancers who stand on relevé as they turn or travel in a circle or figure eight.

==Costume==
Since the 1950s, it has been illegal in Egypt for belly dancers to perform publicly with their midriff uncovered or to display excessive skin. It is therefore becoming more common to wear a long, figure-hugging lycra one-piece gown with strategically placed cut-outs filled in with sheer, flesh-coloured fabric and the skirt is sometimes embroidered. A sheer body stocking covers the midsection. Egyptian dancers traditionally dance in bare feet, but these days often wear shoes and even high heels.

==Respectability in Egypt==
Generally, Egyptians do not consider Raks Sharki to be a respectable profession. but many Egyptians continue to employ native Egyptian dancers for special events. Strict moral laws prevent a lot of local Egyptian dancers from performing in public spaces so many dancers performing for tourists in nightclubs today are foreigners. 

Belly dancers in Egypt have restrictions placed on their costume and movements. Most notably, no floor work is permitted and the dancer&#x27;s midriff must be covered. However, many Egyptian nightclubs don&#x27;t necessarily follow the government guidelines. 

In 2009, a plan to establish a state institute to train belly dancers in Egypt came under heavy fire as it &quot;seriously challenges the Egyptian society&#x27;s traditions and glaringly violates the constitution&quot;, said Farid Esmail a member of the parliament, a thing that was widely viewed by many Egyptian celebrities and dancers as hate against Egyptian arts.

<text>Lee Chang-dong (; born July 4, 1954) is a South Korean film director, screenwriter, and novelist. He has directed six feature films: &quot;Green Fish&quot; (1997), &quot;Peppermint Candy&quot; (1999), &quot;Oasis&quot; (2002), &quot;Secret Sunshine&quot; (2007), &quot;Poetry&quot; (2010), and &quot;Burning&quot; (2018). &quot;Burning&quot; became the first Korean film to make it to the 91st Academy Awards&#x27; final nine-film shortlist for Best Foreign Language Film. &quot;Burning&quot; also won the Fipresci International Critics&#x27; Prize at the 71st Cannes Film Festival, Best Foreign Language Film in Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and Best Foreign Language Film in Toronto Film Critics Association.

Lee has won Silver Lion for Best Director and Fipresci International Critics&#x27; Prize at the 2002 Venice Film Festival and the Best Screenplay Award at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. He also won the award for Achievement in Directing at the 4th Asia Pacific Screen Awards in 2017, Jury Grand Prize at the 2018 Asia Pacific Screen Awards, Best Director and Lifetime Achievement Award at the 13th Asian Film Awards in 2019, and he has been nominated for the Golden Lion and the Palme d&#x27;Or. Lee served as South Korea&#x27;s Minister of Culture and Tourism from 2003 to 2004.

==Early life==
Lee Chang-dong was born in Daegu, Korea. He graduated in 1981 with a degree in Korean Literature from Kyungpook National University in Daegu, where he spent much of his time in the theater, writing and directing plays. He went on to teach high school Korean and established himself as a novelist with his first novel &quot;Chonri&quot; in 1983.

== Career ==
Lee had no formal training in filmmaking. He was approached by Park Kwang-su to write the screenplay for &quot;To the Starry Island.&quot; Lee negotiated for an assistant director (AD) position as part of the deal and was promoted to first AD on the first day of the shoot when the original first AD failed to show up. The film was released in 1993. He went on to write &quot;A Single Spark&quot; in 1995, which won Best Film at the 1995 Blue Dragon Film Awards.

After being encouraged by his contemporaries to finally step behind the director&#x27;s chair, Lee made &quot;Green Fish&quot;, a &quot;critique of Korean society told through the eyes of a young man who becomes enmeshed in the criminal underworld&quot;, in 1997. &quot;Green Fish&quot; won Best Film at Blue Dragon Film Awards, Dragons and Tigers Award at the Vancouver International Film Festival, and had NETPAC Award&#x27;s Special Mention at Rotterdam International Film Festival.
In 2000, Lee made &quot;Peppermint Candy&quot;, a story following a single man in reverse chronology through 20 years of South Korean history—from 1980&#x27;s student uprising, to the film&#x27;s 2000 release. &quot;Peppermint Candy&quot; won Special Jury Prize at Bratislava International Film Festival, and got three awards at Karlovy Vary International Film Festival including Don Quijote Award, Special Jury Prize and NETPAC Award. The film also won Best Film at Grand Bell Awards.

Lee released &quot;Oasis&quot; in 2002, a story involving a mentally ill man and a woman with cerebral palsy, winning the Silver Lion for Best Director at the 2003 Venice Film Festival. &quot;Oasis&quot; was selected as Korean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 75th Academy Awards. The film was awarded Chief Dan George Humanitarian Award at 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival. It also won 2003 Venice International Film Festival&#x27;s Special Director&#x27;s Award, FIPRESCI Prize, and SIGNIS Award. Lee won Baeksang Arts Awards for Best Director. &quot;Oasis&quot; was nominated at the 2005 Independent Spirit Awards for Best Foreign Film.

From 2003 to 2004, Lee served as the minister of Culture and Tourism in the South Korean Government. On the political appointment, Lee said:
In October 2006, Lee was awarded with the Chevalier (Knight) order of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur (Legion of Honor) by the French government for &quot;his contribution to maintaining the screen quota to promote cultural diversity as a cultural minister.&quot; It was delivered to the French embassy in South Korea by the French Minister of Culture, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres during an official visit.

Lee&#x27;s fourth film, &quot;Secret Sunshine&quot; about a grieving mother who loses her son, was completed in 2007. At the 60th Cannes Film Festival, the film was entered in the competition category with lead actress Jeon Do-yeon, winning the &quot;Prix d&#x27;interprétation féminine&quot;. It was released to theaters in South Korea in 2007, and was South Korea&#x27;s submission for the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film in 2008. &quot;Secret Sunshine&quot; won Best Feature Film at Asia Pacific Screen Awards. It won Best Film and Best Director at 2008 Asian Film Awards. It won Best Picture and Best Director at Korean Film Awards, Best Director at Director&#x27;s Cut Awards, and Special Award at Grand Bell Awards.

In 2009, Lee was appointed as a jury member of the international competition in 61st Cannes Film Festival along with Isabelle Huppert, Shu Qi and Robin Wright.

The following year, Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Poetry&quot; was released. The film tells a story of a suburban woman in her 60s who begins to develop an interest in poetry while struggling with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and her irresponsible grandson. It garnered positive critical reviews and won the Best Screenplay Award at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival. Notably, the film&#x27;s starring role was played by Yoon Jeong-hee, who was returning to the screen after an absence of 16 years. For this film, Lee won Achievement in Directing in Asia Pacific Screen Awards. &quot;Poetry&quot; also won Best Film and Best Screenplay at 2010 Grand Bell Awards, and Lee won Best Director at 2011 Baeksang Arts Awards.

Lee returned after eight years of hiatus with a 2018 psychological drama mystery film &quot;Burning&quot;, based on one of Haruki Murakami&#x27;s seventeen short stories in &quot;The Elephant Vanishes&quot;, &quot;Barn Burning&quot;. The film premiered at the 71st Cannes Film Festival, winning the Fipresci International Critics&#x27; Prize. It became the highest-rated film in the history of Screen International’s Cannes jury grid. &quot;Burning&quot; was selected as the South Korean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, and became the first Korean film to make it to the final nine-film shortlist of the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. &quot;Burning&quot; also won Best Foreign Language Film in Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Best Foreign Language Film in Toronto Film Critics Association, and the runner-up of National Board of Review&#x27;s Top Five Foreign Language Film. For this film, Lee won Best Director at 2018 Buil Film Awards and 2019 KOFRA Film Awards. In addition to international acclaims, the film also won 2018 Grand Bell Awards for Best Film and FIPRESCI Award at Korean Association of Film Critics Awards.

In March 2019, Lee won Best Director for &quot;Burning&quot; and was honored Lifetime Achievement Award at the 13th Asian Film Awards. In 2021, he was appointed as the head of jury of the international competition in the 15th Asian Film Awards. He has also worked with Jason Yu&#x27;s first film &quot;Sleep&quot; along with Bong Joon-ho.

==Political beliefs==
Lee Chang-dong was born in Daegu, the most conservative and rightist city in Korea, to lower middle-class parents, who were left-leaning, particularly his father. His family came from noble class of the old Korea. This contradiction of growing up in an ex-noble family with socialist ties shaped his character, and subsequently his film style.

Lee supported Roh Moo-hyun&#x27;s candidacy since 2002, and after he won the elections, Lee served in the office as Minister of Culture from 2003 to 2004. During his term, Lee proposed a screen quota for independent film but his proposal met with fierce opposition by the Korean movie industry. However, in October 2006, he was rewarded for his efforts with the Chevalier (Knight) order of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur (Legion of Honor) by the French government for &quot;his contribution to maintaining the screen quota to promote cultural diversity as a cultural minister&quot;.

Lee has been boycotting and refusing to attend the Blue Dragon Film Awards ceremony since 2002 due to political conflicts with Chosun Ilbo, a conservative South Korean newspaper which hosts the awards. Consequently, since 2002 his films have never been submitted to the competition and were excluded from the nomination for the award&#x27;s best picture and best director.

For nearly a decade until 2017, during the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye presidential administrations, Lee Chang-dong was blacklisted by the government. Artists such as Lee that were put on the blacklist were subject to investigations and denial of subsidies. Lee recalls of his eight-year-hiatus:

==Film and directing style==

Lee Chang-dong describes his creative process as one of utter despair. All his films are dark stories of innocence lost, suffering and alienation. His key themes have been consistently about psychological trauma. Rather than allowing his characters simply to wallow in their misery, Lee draws them into situations that make them search, often futilely, for the meaning of life. Memory has often been an important theme for Lee. His work can be defined by the tragedy genre and his stories almost always involve his characters experiencing some degree of suffering.

His films are the reflection of the repressive social and political climate of the South Korea, and depictions of marginalized blue-collar Koreans. His characters are characteristically anti-heroic, but he seems to justify them due to their background. Through realistic portraits of troubled characters, Lee asks the audience to examine themselves and to look at what society pushes under the rug. However, he shies away from masking his themes with bold surrealism. Instead, he&#x27;s more driven by naturalism.

Lee doesn&#x27;t give too specific direction when he works with actors. He believes that an actor&#x27;s reaction is more important than the action. He doesn&#x27;t have a particular method of directing. He doesn&#x27;t tell the actors to act or be in a certain way. Instead, he tells them to become the persona, the character in the film. He said, &quot;What I try to have them do is become the character, to feel like the character. I do not try to be very specific in how I direct my actors, for instance I will not say things like &#x27;Use this expression&#x27; or &#x27;Speak this way&#x27;, or &#x27;Can you please raise the pitch of your voice a bit higher&#x27; or anything like that.&quot; And, &quot;Sometimes, actors expect from me a bit more detail, to give them specific advise but I don&#x27;t do that. But what I DO sometimes is to tell them different stories, or speak about other things that do not seem to have anything in common with what the actors should be playing, but indirectly might help them feel the same way as the character feels so that they become the character.&quot;It was talked about that there is a lot of pressure on a Lee Chang-dong set. In response to the pressures felt by Moon So-ri and Sul Kyung-gu on his film set, Lee said, &quot;[...] I&#x27;ve never raised my voice, and I&#x27;m never really about giving any sort of strict direction, especially when it comes to working with the actors. When it comes to acting, I really prefer the actors to find themselves in the character, and find themselves living in the situations, themselves. I&#x27;m not someone to tell them, or to instruct them how to express whatever in a certain sort of situation.&quot; And, &quot;[...] One of the things that I say a lot to my actors is, &#x27;Don&#x27;t act&#x27;. That be a bit flabbergasting to actors, because, &#x27;Wait, I&#x27;m an actor, I&#x27;m supposed to act. What do you mean? What does that mean?&#x27; That can come as a confusing statement.&quot;

==Literature==

In 1987, Lee Chang-dong published his first short story, &quot;Possession&quot;, followed by the novella &quot;There&#x27;s a Lot of Shit in Nokcheon&quot; in 1992 which won him &quot;The Korea Times Literary&quot; Prize, and then &quot;Tenaciousness&quot; in 1996.

Lee said about his writing style, &quot;I always wrote for one person, for this person who thought and felt the same way as I do. It almost felt like I was writing a love letter to this very specific person who would understand what I&#x27;m writing and share the same feelings and thoughts.&quot;In 2007, Lee&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Dreaming Beast&quot; (translated by Heinz Insu Fenkl), was published in the journal &quot;AZALEA&quot;. In 2018, his short story, &quot;On Destiny&quot; (translated by Soyoung Kim), was published in the journal &quot;Asymptote&quot;.

In 2023, Lee&#x27;s short story, &quot;Snowy Day&quot; (translated by Heinz Insu Fenkl and Yoosup Chang), was published in the March 6th, 2023 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. In 2024, Lee&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Leper&quot; (translated by Heinz Insu Fenkl) was also published in the December 30th, 2024 and January 6th, 2025 double issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Lee&#x27;s first collection of short stories in English, &quot;Snowy Day &amp; Other Stories&quot; (translated by Heinz Insu Fenkl and Yoosup Chang), will be published by Penguin Random House in early 2025. The collection includes four short stories and three novellas taken from his two original Korean collections, &quot;There&#x27;s a Lot of Shit in Nokcheon&quot; (1992) and &quot;Burning Paper&quot; (1987).

==Personal life==
Lee Chang-dong is the third son out of four brothers. He said that they were very close, and called themselves fraternity brothers. His youngest brother, Lee Joon-dong, is a film producer for Lee&#x27;s films. Lee hoped to become a painter growing up, but he could not afford art supplies. Lee and the president of MBC television and radio network company, Choi Seung-ho, are old friends and Kyungpook National University alumni. He personally asked Choi to appear in &quot;Burning&quot; playing as Jong-su&#x27;s father. He is also a close friend of his frequent collaborator, actor Moon Sung-keun.
