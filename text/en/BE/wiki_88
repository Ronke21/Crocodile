<text>In theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG) is a formal apparatus that allows systematic investigation of the changes of a physical system as viewed at different scales. In particle physics, it reflects the changes in the underlying physical laws (codified in a quantum field theory) as the energy (or mass) scale at which physical processes occur varies.

A change in scale is called a scale transformation. The renormalization group is intimately related to &quot;scale invariance&quot; and &quot;conformal invariance&quot;, symmetries in which a system appears the same at all scales (self-similarity), where under the fixed point of the renormalization group flow the field theory is conformally invariant.

As the scale varies, it is as if one is decreasing (as RG is a semi-group and doesn&#x27;t have a well-defined inverse operation) the magnifying power of a notional microscope viewing the system. In so-called renormalizable theories, the system at one scale will generally consist of self-similar copies of itself when viewed at a smaller scale, with different parameters describing the components of the system. The components, or fundamental variables, may relate to atoms, elementary particles, atomic spins, etc. The parameters of the theory typically describe the interactions of the components. These may be variable couplings which measure the strength of various forces, or mass parameters themselves. The components themselves may appear to be composed of more of the self-same components as one goes to shorter distances.

For example, in quantum electrodynamics (QED), an electron appears to be composed of electron and positron pairs and photons, as one views it at higher resolution, at very short distances. The electron at such short distances has a slightly different electric charge than does the dressed electron seen at large distances, and this change, or &quot;running&quot;, in the value of the electric charge is determined by the renormalization group equation.

==History==
The idea of scale transformations and scale invariance is old in physics: Scaling arguments were commonplace for the Pythagorean school, Euclid, and up to Galileo. They became popular again at the end of the 19th century, perhaps the first example being the idea of enhanced viscosity of Osborne Reynolds, as a way to explain turbulence.

The renormalization group was initially devised in particle physics, but nowadays its applications extend to solid-state physics, fluid mechanics, physical cosmology, and even nanotechnology. An early article by Ernst Stueckelberg and André Petermann in 1953 anticipates the idea in quantum field theory. Stueckelberg and Petermann opened the field conceptually. They noted that renormalization exhibits a group of transformations which transfers quantities from the bare terms to the counter terms. They introduced a function &quot;h&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) in quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is now known as the beta function (see below).

===Beginnings===
Murray Gell-Mann and Francis E. Low restricted the idea to scale transformations in QED in 1954, which are the most physically significant, and focused on asymptotic forms of the photon propagator at high energies. They determined the variation of the electromagnetic coupling in QED, by appreciating the simplicity of the scaling structure of that theory. They thus discovered that the coupling parameter &quot;g&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;) at the energy scale &quot;μ&quot; is effectively given by the (one-dimensional translation) group equation
:formula_1
or equivalently, formula_2, for an arbitrary function &quot;G&quot; (known as Wegner&#x27;s scaling function) and a constant &quot;d&quot;, in terms of the coupling &quot;g(M)&quot; at a reference scale &quot;M&quot;.

Gell-Mann and Low realized in these results that the effective scale can be arbitrarily taken as &quot;μ&quot;, and can vary to define the theory at any other scale:
:formula_3
The gist of the RG is this group property: as the scale &quot;μ&quot; varies, the theory presents a self-similar replica of itself, and any scale can be accessed similarly from any other scale, by group action, a formal transitive conjugacy of couplings in the mathematical sense (Schröder&#x27;s equation).

On the basis of this (finite) group equation and its scaling property, Gell-Mann and Low could then focus on infinitesimal transformations, and invented a computational method based on a mathematical flow function of the coupling parameter &quot;g&quot;, which they introduced. Like the function &quot;h&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) of Stueckelberg-Petermann, their function determines the differential change of the coupling &quot;g&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;) with respect to a small change in energy scale &quot;μ&quot; through a differential equation, the &quot;renormalization group equation&quot;:
:formula_4
The modern name is also indicated, the beta function, introduced by C. Callan and K. Symanzik in 1970. Since it is a mere function of &quot;g&quot;, integration in &quot;g&quot; of a perturbative estimate of it permits specification of the renormalization trajectory of the coupling, that is, its variation with energy, effectively the function &quot;G&quot; in this perturbative approximation. The renormalization group prediction (cf. Stueckelberg–Petermann and Gell-Mann–Low works) was confirmed 40 years later at the LEP accelerator experiments: the fine structure &quot;constant&quot; of QED was measured to be about at energies close to 200 GeV, as opposed to the standard low-energy physics value of .

=== Deeper understanding ===
The renormalization group emerges from the renormalization of the quantum field variables, which normally has to address the problem of infinities in a quantum field theory. This problem of systematically handling the infinities of quantum field theory to obtain finite physical quantities was solved for QED by Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger and Shin&#x27;ichirō Tomonaga, who received the 1965 Nobel prize for these contributions. They effectively devised the theory of mass and charge renormalization, in which the infinity in the momentum scale is cut off by an ultra-large regulator, Λ.

The dependence of physical quantities, such as the electric charge or electron mass, on the scale Λ is hidden, effectively swapped for the longer-distance scales at which the physical quantities are measured, and, as a result, all observable quantities end up being finite instead, even for an infinite Λ. Gell-Mann and Low thus realized in these results that, infinitesimally, while a tiny change in &quot; g&quot; is provided by the above RG equation given ψ(&quot;g&quot;), the self-similarity is expressed by the fact that ψ(&quot;g&quot;) depends explicitly only upon the parameter(s) of the theory, and not upon the scale &quot;μ&quot;. Consequently, the above renormalization group equation may be solved for (&quot;G&quot; and thus) &quot;g&quot;(&quot;μ&quot;).

A deeper understanding of the physical meaning and generalization of the renormalization process, which goes beyond the dilation group of conventional &quot;renormalizable&quot; theories, considers methods where widely different scales of lengths appear simultaneously. It came from condensed matter physics: Leo P. Kadanoff&#x27;s paper in 1966 proposed the &quot;block-spin&quot; renormalization group. The &quot;blocking idea&quot; is a way to define the components of the theory at large distances as aggregates of components at shorter distances.

This approach covered the conceptual point and was given full computational substance in the extensive important work of Kenneth Wilson. The power of Wilson&#x27;s ideas was demonstrated by a constructive iterative renormalization solution of a long-standing problem, the Kondo problem, in 1975, as well as the preceding seminal developments of his new method in the theory of second-order phase transitions and critical phenomena in 1971. He was awarded the Nobel prize for these decisive contributions in 1982.

===Reformulation===
Meanwhile, the RG in particle physics had been reformulated in more practical terms by Callan and Symanzik in 1970. The above beta function, which describes the &quot;running of the coupling&quot; parameter with scale, was also found to amount to the &quot;canonical trace anomaly&quot;, which represents the quantum-mechanical breaking of scale (dilation) symmetry in a field theory. Applications of the RG to particle physics exploded in number in the 1970s with the establishment of the Standard Model.

In 1973, it was discovered that a theory of interacting colored quarks, called quantum chromodynamics, had a negative beta function. This means that an initial high-energy value of the coupling will eventuate a special value of at which the coupling blows up (diverges). This special value is the scale of the strong interactions, = and occurs at about 200 MeV. Conversely, the coupling becomes weak at very high energies (asymptotic freedom), and the quarks become observable as point-like particles, in deep inelastic scattering, as anticipated by Feynman–Bjorken scaling. QCD was thereby established as the quantum field theory controlling the strong interactions of particles.

Momentum space RG also became a highly developed tool in solid state physics, but was hindered by the extensive use of perturbation theory, which prevented the theory from succeeding in strongly correlated systems.

=== Conformal symmetry ===
Conformal symmetry is associated with the vanishing of the beta function. This can occur naturally if a coupling constant is attracted, by running, toward a &quot;fixed point&quot; at which &quot;β&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) = 0. In QCD, the fixed point occurs at short distances where &quot;g&quot; → 0 and is called a (trivial) ultraviolet fixed point. For heavy quarks, such as the top quark, the coupling to the mass-giving Higgs boson runs toward a fixed non-zero (non-trivial) infrared fixed point, first predicted by Pendleton and Ross (1981), and C. T. Hill. 
The top quark Yukawa coupling lies slightly below the infrared fixed point of the Standard Model suggesting the possibility of additional new physics, such as sequential heavy Higgs bosons.

In string theory, conformal invariance of the string world-sheet is a fundamental symmetry: &quot;β&quot; = 0 is a requirement. Here, &quot;β&quot; is a function of the geometry of the space-time in which the string moves. This determines the space-time dimensionality of the string theory and enforces Einstein&#x27;s equations of general relativity on the geometry. The RG is of fundamental importance to string theory and theories of grand unification.

It is also the modern key idea underlying critical phenomena in condensed matter physics. Indeed, the RG has become one of the most important tools of modern physics. It is often used in combination with the Monte Carlo method.

==Block spin==
This section introduces pedagogically a picture of RG which may be easiest to grasp: the block spin RG, devised by Leo P. Kadanoff in 1966.

Consider a 2D solid, a set of atoms in a perfect square array, as depicted in the figure.

Assume that atoms interact among themselves only with their nearest neighbours, and that the system is at a given temperature . The strength of their interaction is quantified by a certain coupling . The physics of the system will be described by a certain formula, say the Hamiltonian .

Now proceed to divide the solid into blocks of 2×2 squares; we attempt to describe the system in terms of block variables, i.e., variables which describe the average behavior of the block. Further assume that, by some lucky coincidence, the physics of block variables is described by a &quot;formula of the same kind&quot;, but with different values for and : . (This isn&#x27;t exactly true, in general, but it is often a good first approximation.)

Perhaps, the initial problem was too hard to solve, since there were too many atoms. Now, in the renormalized problem we have only one fourth of them. But why stop now? Another iteration of the same kind leads to , and only one sixteenth of the atoms. We are increasing the observation scale with each RG step.

Of course, the best idea is to iterate until there is only one very big block. Since the number of atoms in any real sample of material is very large, this is more or less equivalent to finding the &quot;long range&quot; behavior of the RG transformation which took and . Often, when iterated many times, this RG transformation leads to a certain number of fixed points.

To be more concrete, consider a magnetic system (e.g., the Ising model), in which the coupling denotes the trend of neighbor spins to be aligned. The configuration of the system is the result of the tradeoff between the ordering term and the disordering effect of temperature.

For many models of this kind there are three fixed points: 
# and . This means that, at the largest size, temperature becomes unimportant, i.e., the disordering factor vanishes. Thus, in large scales, the system appears to be ordered. We are in a ferromagnetic phase.
# and . Exactly the opposite; here, temperature dominates, and the system is disordered at large scales.
# A nontrivial point between them, and . In this point, changing the scale does not change the physics, because the system is in a fractal state. It corresponds to the Curie phase transition, and is also called a critical point.

So, if we are given a certain material with given values of and , all we have to do in order to find out the large-scale behaviour of the system is to iterate the pair until we find the corresponding fixed point.

==Elementary theory==
In more technical terms, let us assume that we have a theory described by a certain function formula_5 of the state variables formula_6 and a certain set of coupling constants formula_7. This function may be a partition function, an action, a Hamiltonian, etc. It must contain the whole description of the physics of the system.

Now we consider a certain blocking transformation of the state variables formula_8, the number of formula_9 must be lower than the number of formula_10. Now let us try to rewrite the formula_5 function &quot;only&quot; in terms of the formula_9. If this is achievable by a certain change in the parameters, formula_13, then the theory is said to be renormalizable.

Most fundamental theories of physics such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics and electro-weak interaction, but not gravity, are exactly renormalizable. Also, most theories in condensed matter physics are approximately renormalizable, from superconductivity to fluid turbulence.

The change in the parameters is implemented by a certain beta function: formula_14, which is said to induce a renormalization group flow (or RG flow) on the formula_15-space. The values of formula_15 under the flow are called running couplings.

As was stated in the previous section, the most important information in the RG flow are its fixed points. The possible macroscopic states of the system, at a large scale, are given by this set of fixed points. If these fixed points correspond to a free field theory, the theory is said to exhibit quantum triviality, possessing what is called a Landau pole, as in quantum electrodynamics. For a 4 interaction, Michael Aizenman proved that this theory is indeed trivial, for space-time dimension ≥ 5. For = 4, the triviality has yet to be proven rigorously, but lattice computations have provided strong evidence for this. This fact is important as quantum triviality can be used to bound or even &quot;predict&quot; parameters such as the Higgs boson mass in asymptotic safety scenarios. Numerous fixed points appear in the study of lattice Higgs theories, but the nature of the quantum field theories associated with these remains an open question.

Since the RG transformations in such systems are lossy (i.e.: the number of variables decreases - see as an example in a different context, Lossy data compression), there need not be an inverse for a given RG transformation. Thus, in such lossy systems, the renormalization group is, in fact, a semigroup, as lossiness implies that there is no unique inverse for each element.

==Relevant and irrelevant operators and universality classes==

Consider a certain observable of a physical system undergoing an RG transformation. The magnitude of the observable as the length scale of the system goes from small to large determines the importance of the observable(s) for the scaling law:

A &quot;relevant&quot; observable is needed to describe the macroscopic behaviour of the system; &quot;irrelevant&quot; observables are not needed. &quot;Marginal&quot; observables may or may not need to be taken into account. A remarkable broad fact is that &quot;most observables are irrelevant&quot;, i.e., &quot;the macroscopic physics is dominated by only a few observables in most systems&quot;.

As an example, in microscopic physics, to describe a system consisting of a mole of carbon-12 atoms we need of the order of 10 (the Avogadro number) variables, while to describe it as a macroscopic system (12 grams of carbon-12) we only need a few.

Before Wilson&#x27;s RG approach, there was an astonishing empirical fact to explain: The coincidence of the critical exponents (i.e., the exponents of the reduced-temperature dependence of several quantities near a second order phase transition) in very disparate phenomena, such as magnetic systems, superfluid transition (Lambda transition), alloy physics, etc. So in general, thermodynamic features of a system near a phase transition &quot;depend only on a small number of variables&quot;, such as the dimensionality and symmetry, but are insensitive to details of the underlying microscopic properties of the system.

This coincidence of critical exponents for ostensibly quite different physical systems, called universality, is easily explained using the renormalization group, by demonstrating that the differences in phenomena among the individual fine-scale components are determined by &quot;irrelevant observables&quot;, while the &quot;relevant observables&quot; are shared in common. Hence many macroscopic phenomena may be grouped into a small set of universality classes, specified by the shared sets of relevant observables.

==Momentum space==
Renormalization groups, in practice, come in two main &quot;flavors&quot;. The Kadanoff picture explained above refers mainly to the so-called real-space RG.

Momentum-space RG on the other hand, has a longer history despite its relative subtlety. It can be used for systems where the degrees of freedom can be cast in terms of the Fourier modes of a given field. The RG transformation proceeds by &quot;integrating out&quot; a certain set of high-momentum (large-wavenumber) modes. Since large wavenumbers are related to short-length scales, the momentum-space RG results in an essentially analogous coarse-graining effect as with real-space RG.

Momentum-space RG is usually performed on a perturbation expansion. The validity of such an expansion is predicated upon the actual physics of a system being close to that of a free field system. In this case, one may calculate observables by summing the leading terms in the expansion. 
This approach has proved successful for many theories, including most of particle physics, but fails for systems whose physics is very far from any free system, i.e., systems with strong correlations.

As an example of the physical meaning of RG in particle physics, consider an overview of &quot;charge renormalization&quot; in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Suppose we have a point positive charge of a certain true (or bare) magnitude. The electromagnetic field around it has a certain energy, and thus may produce some virtual electron-positron pairs (for example). Although virtual particles annihilate very quickly, during their short lives the electron will be attracted by the charge, and the positron will be repelled. Since this happens uniformly everywhere near the point charge, where its electric field is sufficiently strong, these pairs effectively create a screen around the charge when viewed from far away. The measured strength of the charge will depend on how close our measuring probe can approach the point charge, bypassing more of the screen of virtual particles the closer it gets. Hence a &quot;dependence of a certain coupling constant (here, the electric charge) with distance scale&quot;.

Momentum and length scales are related inversely, according to the de Broglie relation: The higher the energy or momentum scale we may reach, the lower the length scale we may probe and resolve. Therefore, the momentum-space RG practitioners sometimes claim to &quot;integrate out&quot; high momenta or high energy from their theories.

==Exact renormalization group equations==
An exact renormalization group equation (ERGE) is one that takes irrelevant couplings into account. There are several formulations.

The Wilson ERGE is the simplest conceptually, but is practically impossible to implement. Fourier transform into momentum space after Wick rotating into Euclidean space. Insist upon a hard momentum cutoff, so that the only degrees of freedom are those with momenta less than . The partition function is 
:formula_17

For any positive Λ′ less than Λ, define &quot;S&quot;Λ′ (a functional over field configurations whose Fourier transform has momentum support within ) as
:formula_18

If depends only on and not on derivatives of , this may be rewritten as

formula_19

in which it becomes clear that, since only functions &quot;φ&quot; with support between and are integrated over, the left hand side may still depend on with support outside that range. Obviously,
:formula_20

In fact, this transformation is transitive. If you compute from and then compute from , this gives you the same Wilsonian action as computing &quot;S&quot;Λ″ directly from &quot;S&quot;Λ.

The Polchinski ERGE involves a smooth UV regulator cutoff. Basically, the idea is an improvement over the Wilson ERGE. Instead of a sharp momentum cutoff, it uses a smooth cutoff. Essentially, we suppress contributions from momenta greater than heavily. The smoothness of the cutoff, however, allows us to derive a functional differential equation in the cutoff scale . As in Wilson&#x27;s approach, we have a different action functional for each cutoff energy scale . Each of these actions are supposed to describe exactly the same model which means that their partition functionals have to match exactly.

In other words, (for a real scalar field; generalizations to other fields are obvious),
:formula_21

and &quot;Z&quot;Λ is really independent of ! We have used the condensed deWitt notation here. We have also split the bare action &quot;S&quot;Λ into a quadratic kinetic part and an interacting part &quot;S&quot;int Λ. This split most certainly isn&#x27;t clean. The &quot;interacting&quot; part can very well also contain quadratic kinetic terms. In fact, if there is any wave function renormalization, it most certainly will. This can be somewhat reduced by introducing field rescalings. RΛ is a function of the momentum p and the second term in the exponent is
:formula_22
when expanded.

When formula_23, is essentially 1. When formula_24, becomes very very huge and approaches infinity. is always greater than or equal to 1 and is smooth. Basically, this leaves the fluctuations with momenta less than the cutoff unaffected but heavily suppresses contributions from fluctuations with momenta greater than the cutoff. This is obviously a huge improvement over Wilson.

The condition that
:formula_25
can be satisfied by (but not only by)
:formula_26

Jacques Distler claimed without proof that this ERGE is not correct nonperturbatively.

The effective average action ERGE involves a smooth IR regulator cutoff. 
The idea is to take all fluctuations right up to an IR scale into account. The effective average action will be accurate for fluctuations with momenta larger than . As the parameter is lowered, the effective average action approaches the effective action which includes all quantum and classical fluctuations. In contrast, for large the effective average action is close to the &quot;bare action&quot;. So, the effective average action interpolates between the &quot;bare action&quot; and the effective action.

For a real scalar field, one adds an IR cutoff
:formula_27
to the action , where &quot;R&quot;&quot;k&quot; is a function of both and such that for 
formula_28, Rk(p) is very tiny and approaches 0 and for formula_29, formula_30. &quot;R&quot;&quot;k&quot; is both smooth and nonnegative. Its large value for small momenta leads to a suppression of their contribution to the partition function which is effectively the same thing as neglecting large-scale fluctuations.

One can use the condensed deWitt notation
:formula_31
for this IR regulator.

So,
:formula_32
where is the source field. The Legendre transform of &quot;W&quot;&quot;k&quot; ordinarily gives the effective action. However, the action that we started off with is really &quot;S&quot;[&quot;φ&quot;] + 1/2 &quot;φ⋅R&quot;&quot;k&quot;⋅&quot;φ&quot; and so, to get the effective average action, we subtract off 1/2 &quot;φ&quot;⋅&quot;R&quot;&quot;k&quot;⋅&quot;φ&quot;. In other words,
:formula_33
can be inverted to give &quot;J&quot;&quot;k&quot;[&quot;φ&quot;] and we define the effective average action Γ&quot;k&quot; as
:formula_34

Hence,
:formula_35

thus
:formula_36
is the ERGE which is also known as the Wetterich equation. As shown by Morris the effective action Γk is in fact simply related to Polchinski&#x27;s effective action Sint via a Legendre transform relation.

As there are infinitely many choices of &quot;k&quot;, there are also infinitely many different interpolating ERGEs.
Generalization to other fields like spinorial fields is straightforward.

Although the Polchinski ERGE and the effective average action ERGE look similar, they are based upon very different philosophies. In the effective average action ERGE, the bare action is left unchanged (and the UV cutoff scale—if there is one—is also left unchanged) but the IR contributions to the effective action are suppressed whereas in the Polchinski ERGE, the QFT is fixed once and for all but the &quot;bare action&quot; is varied at different energy scales to reproduce the prespecified model. Polchinski&#x27;s version is certainly much closer to Wilson&#x27;s idea in spirit. Note that one uses &quot;bare actions&quot; whereas the other uses effective (average) actions.

== Renormalization group improvement of the effective potential ==
The renormalization group can also be used to compute effective potentials at orders higher than 1-loop. This kind of approach is particularly interesting to compute corrections to the Coleman–Weinberg mechanism. To do so, one must write the renormalization group equation in terms of the effective potential. To the case of the formula_37 model:

: formula_38

In order to determine the effective potential, it is useful to write formula_39 as

: formula_40

where formula_41 is a power series in formula_42:

: formula_43

Using the above ansatz, it is possible to solve the renormalization group equation perturbatively and find the effective potential up to desired order. A pedagogical explanation of this technique is shown in reference.

<doc id="291465" wikidata="Q208207" url="?curid=291465" title="Britney (album)">
<text>Britney is the third studio album by American singer Britney Spears. It was released on October 31, 2001, by Jive Records. Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of her first two studio albums &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; (1999) and &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot; (2000), Spears began to embrace a significantly more mature sound with &quot;Britney&quot;. The record incorporates genres of pop and R&amp;B with influences of EDM and occasionally dips into disco, hip hop, rock, and electronica. Its lyrical themes address the subjects such as coming of age, adulthood, control, and sexuality. Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators, including Max Martin and Rami Yacoub. Spears herself assumed a more prominent role in the album&#x27;s development, co-writing six of its tracks. The album correlated with Spears&#x27;s feature film &quot;Crossroads&quot; (2002), in which three tracks from the album were featured.

&quot;Britney&quot; received generally mixed reviews from music critics, who complimented Spears&#x27; musical progression but criticized her increasingly provocative image. The album was a global commercial success and debuted atop the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 746,000 copies, making Spears the first female artist to have her first three studio albums debut atop the chart, a record she would later break with her fourth studio album &quot;In the Zone&quot; (2003). The album received a nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards (2003). With worldwide sales of over 10 million copies, &quot;Britney&quot; is one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century.

&quot;Britney&quot; produced six singles. &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot;, the lead single, reached the top ten in 20 countries. &quot;Overprotected&quot; also achieved international commercial success. &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot;, &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; reached the top ten in several countries but all failed to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while &quot;Anticipating&quot; was released exclusively in France instead of &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. To further promote the album, Spears embarked on her fourth concert tour, titled Dream Within a Dream Tour, from November 2001 until July 2002.

==Recording and production==
For her second studio album &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot;, which was released in May 2000 to global commercial success, Spears collaborated with producers such as Rodney Jerkins, Rami Yacoub, and Max Martin; all of them returned for &quot;Britney&quot;. Spears additionally worked with a variety of collaborators, including her then-boyfriend Justin Timberlake. She commented that she initially felt &quot;awkward&quot; and &quot;nervous&quot; working with Timberlake, saying that she was accustomed to the process being &quot;like work&quot;. For the first time, Spears worked with hip hop producers the Neptunes. She claimed to have been inspired by &quot;a lot of hip-hop and R&amp;B while I was on my last tour. I was inspired by Jay-Z and the Neptunes. I told Jive I really wanted to work with [the Neptunes]. I wanted to make [&quot;Britney&quot;] nastier and funkier.&quot; Spears was additionally set to record songs with Missy Elliott and Timbaland, which never came to fruition due to scheduling conflicts.

While recording &quot;Britney&quot;, Spears wanted an &quot;older generation to pick up on it&quot;, adding that she &quot;had to change it up and pray people think that&#x27;s cool&quot;. She stated that she chose to self-title the album because the majority of its content described herself. Spears recorded 23 tracks for the album, several of which she co-wrote with the assistance of Brian Kierulf and Josh Schwartz. She added that personally writing the album and developing its concept made the project &quot;that much more special&quot;, elaborating of her intentions to &quot;get better and grow&quot; as a songwriter. During the sessions, Spears also worked with electronic musician BT, whose tracks were excluded from the standard edition track listing. She stated: &quot;I was really disappointed we weren&#x27;t able to use the tracks BT had done. He&#x27;s a genius in whatever he does, but the type of music he ended up doing didn&#x27;t fit me and what I was going for. I think they will be on some of the stuff [released] overseas.&quot; His contribution &quot;Before the Goodbye&quot; was included on international editions of the album.

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;Britney&quot; is a pop and R&amp;B record with dance influences. It opens with the urban and Middle Eastern-influenced &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot;, which showcases breathy, emotive noises, and has been compared to &quot;Nasty Girl&quot; by Vanity 6. Spears commented that its lyrics are &quot;about me just wanting to go out and forget who I am and dance and have a good time&quot;. Europop-styled &quot;Overprotected&quot; addresses a girl tired of being manipulated. Lyrically, &quot;Lonely&quot; sees a girl moving on from a troublesome romance after being lied to and manipulated, being considered &quot;a teenage version&quot; of Janet Jackson&#x27;s &quot;What About&quot;. The soft rock piano ballad &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot;, co-written by English singer-songwriter Dido, details the emotional struggles girls experience during puberty. &quot;Boys&quot; incorporates R&amp;B and hip hop styles, and was criticized by David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as &quot;cut-rate &#x27;80s Janet Jackson&quot;. The disco-inspired track &quot;Anticipating&quot; discusses the friendship and camaraderie between women, and was described as reminiscent of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Kylie in disco mood.&quot;

Spears&#x27; cover of &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, made famous by Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, infuses pop rock styles into the original hard rock rendition. &quot;Cinderella&quot; reflects on a female protagonist who left her boyfriend after he failed to appreciate her efforts in the relationship. &quot;Let Me Be&quot; sees Spears ask to be trusted as an adult and be afforded her own opinions. &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; discusses a love in which the protagonist feels that the romance will happen &quot;exactly like in a movie&quot;. Similarly, &quot;That&#x27;s Where You Take Me&quot; details the joy she gets from an emotionally fulfilling relationship, amid Middle Eastern chimes and a collage of electronic beats and drum programming. On the electronica international editions bonus track &quot;When I Found You&quot;, Spears sings about having found the &quot;deepest love&quot; in her soulmate who is essentially a reflection of herself. &quot;Britney&quot; closes with &quot;What It&#x27;s Like to Be Me&quot;, which was co-written and co-produced by Spears&#x27;s then-boyfriend Justin Timberlake; Spears sings that a guy must &quot;figure [her] out&quot; to &quot;be [her] man&quot;.

==Release and promotion==

On January 28, 2001, Spears performed at Super Bowl XXXV. Shortly after, she appeared on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; to premiere new material from &quot;Britney&quot;. On September 6, Spears premiered &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot; at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards; the performance was criticized for her use of a yellow python as a stage prop. Four days later, she performed &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot; on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;. Spears was scheduled to perform and hold a press conference in Australia on September 13; however, she cancelled the event in light of the September 11 attacks two days prior, saying that holding the conference would have been inappropriate. The following month, Spears performed at &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

&quot;Britney&quot; was first released in Japan on October 31, being released in the United States on November 6, by Jive Records. An accompanying video album, titled &quot;&quot;, was released two weeks later. It included a selection of her earlier music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, commercials, and notable live performances. The video peaked atop the US Top Music Videos on December 8.
Spears had already begun her Dream Within a Dream Tour in Columbus, Ohio five days before &quot;Britney&quot; was released in the US; the tour ended on July 28, 2002, in Mexico City. Shortly after it began, she performed in her first HBO concert special from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas; Cher was supposed to join Spears onstage for the song &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;, which Spears covered on &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;, but was unable to do so due to scheduling conflicts.

On December 4, 2001, Spears performed at the 2001 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards in Las Vegas. On January 9, 2002, she performed &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot; at the 2002 American Music Awards. Later that month, Spears gave interviews to &quot;The Frank Skinner Show&quot; in the United Kingdom and &quot;The Saturday Show&quot; in Australia. The feature film &quot;Crossroads&quot;, which starred Spears, premiered in February, allowing Spears to simultaneously promote both the film and her album. Several tracks from the album were featured in the film, and &quot;Britney&quot; was cross-promoted as the film&#x27;s soundtrack. On February 2, Spears was featured as both the host and performer on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. A week later, she performed &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot; at the NBA All-Star Game and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Spears also appeared on &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, &quot;The View&quot;, and the 44th Annual Grammy Awards, as well as the German talk show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;.

==Singles==
In the United States, Clear Channel Entertainment &quot;punished&quot; Spears for her management not choosing them as the tour promoter for the Dream Within a Dream Tour by blacklisting her on their radio stations, which greatly affected the performance of her subsequent singles, starting with &quot;I&#x27;m a Slave 4 U&quot;. The song was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on September 25, 2001, to critical acclaim. Due to the radio blacklist, it peaked only at number 27 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming Spears&#x27; first lead single not to peak within the top ten. It fared better internationally, debuting at number four on the UK Singles Chart and peaking within the top ten in 20 countries. Its accompanying music video was directed by Francis Lawrence, and received three nominations at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards.

&quot;Overprotected&quot; was released as the second international single from &quot;Britney&quot; on December 10, 2001, and the third North American single on April 2, 2002. Its Darkchild remix peaked at number 86 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while the original version reached the top ten in Belgium, Croatia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Critically acclaimed, the song was nominated for the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards (2003). Two accompanying music videos were released–the Bille Woodruff-directed video for the original version and the Chris Applebaum-directed Darkchild remix video.

Staggered to fit the varying release dates of &quot;Crossroads&quot; internationally, &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot; was released as the film&#x27;s theme song and the second North American single from &quot;Britney&quot; on January 7, 2002, to critical acclaim. It peaked at number two on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 extension chart. The song fared better internationally, peaking at number two in the UK, and within the top ten in Australia, Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden. Filmed in Arizona and at the Alstrom Point, the song&#x27;s Wayne Isham-directed accompanying music video primarily consists of Spears, whilst wearing cowboy boots, performing the song whilst standing on the edge of a cliff, and inside a slot canyon.

&quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was released as the fourth international single from &quot;Britney&quot; on May 27, 2002, and the fifth and final UK single on November 4, to mixed critical reception. It reached the top ten in Austria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Portugal, Scotland and Slovenia, whilst peaking at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. Directed by Chris Applebaum, its accompanying music video shows Spears with her own band, a stack of speakers and flashing lights. In France, &quot;Anticipating&quot; was released as the fourth single instead of &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; on June 25; it reached number 38 on the French Singles Chart.

The Co-Ed Remix of &quot;Boys&quot;–featuring Pharrell Williams–was released as the fourth North American and UK single, and the fifth and final international single from &quot;Britney&quot; on June 24, 2002, also serving as the second single from the soundtrack for &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;, to mixed critical reception. It peaked at number 22 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, and peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart. Its accompanying music video, directed by Dave Meyers, features Spears, Williams, and Mike Myers as Austin Powers at a party inside a castle, with cameo appearances from actors Jason Priestley, Justin Bruening and Taye Diggs. It was nominated for Best Video from a Film at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Britney&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics, who felt the album was underdeveloped thematically and sonically. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, &quot;Britney&quot; received an average score of 58, which indicates &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;, based on 13 reviews. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found Spears&#x27;s increasingly provocative image to be unnatural, noting &quot;virginal vamping in an awkward adolescence&quot; and &quot;a few tentative new moves&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ Nikki Tranton complimented the production of the songs, but questioned if Spears was ready to establish herself as a grown woman in the music industry. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; agreed, writing that although &quot;&quot;Britney&quot;, [the album], fills her role of guilty pleasure (the disc certainly satiates more than the stunted growth of last year&#x27;s &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;), it&#x27;s time for Spears to quit being such a cock-tease and cook something up that will satisfy the ever-vacillating hype-machine.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a positive review, feeling that the album &quot;strives to deepen [Spears&#x27;s] persona&quot; and proves she &quot;will know what to do when the teen-pop phenomenon of 1999–2001 passes for good&quot;. Similarly, a reviewer from &quot;Billboard&quot; commented that the project was &quot;a nicely varied, wholly satisfying collection&quot;. Chris Heat of &quot;Dotmusic&quot; praised Britney for &quot;us[ing] this opportunity to take the odd risk and adds a welcome edge to her sound.&quot; &quot;NME&quot;″s Ted Kessler recognized the release as a &quot;coming of age album&quot; and joked that it &quot;works best when making a good pop cheese and dance sandwich&quot;. By contrast, Stephen Thompson of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; panned the album, opining that the music &quot;just [isn&#x27;t] catchy&quot; and that &quot;though neither a girl nor a woman, Spears inspires grown-up anger on her own&quot;. Craig Seymore of &quot;Spin&quot; recognized that she &quot;sound[s] almost human,&quot; but criticized that &quot;the rest of the record is as coldly anthemic as ever.&quot;

&quot;Britney&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 745,750 copies, which was the second highest first-week sales by a female artist at the time behind Spears&#x27; own &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot; which sold 1.3 million copies in its first week. In doing so, Spears became the first woman to have her first three studio albums debut atop that chart. She also held the second-highest debut album sales of 2001, behind &quot;Celebrity&quot; by NSYNC with 1.88 million units moved and was the highest debut-week sales by a female artist of the year.

Internationally, &quot;Britney&quot; debuted atop the Canadian Albums Chart with first-week sales of 44,550 copies. It later sold 316,944 copies in the country, a significant decline in relation to the sales of &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; (1999) and &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot; (2000). The album peaked at number four on both the Oricon Albums Chart in Japan and the UK Albums Chart. In the latter, it was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 300,000 copies to retailers. Across the rest of Europe, &quot;Britney&quot; debuted at number one in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. In 2002, it was certified double platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for shipments of two million copies throughout Europe.

<doc id="291466" wikidata="Q2316985" url="?curid=291466" title="Mac 68k emulator">
<text>The Mac 68k emulator is a software emulator built into all versions of the classic Mac OS for PowerPC. This emulator enabled running applications and system code that were originally written for the 680x0-based Macintosh models. With a few exceptions, notably Connectix&#x27;s RAM Doubler, the emulator ran all software with no noticeable impact other than lower performance relative to the same program when compiled for PowerPC.

==Origins==
The first version was written by Gary Davidian, who had originally created it for use on the Motorola 88000 CPU, used in Apple&#x27;s abortive first attempt at a RISC target platform. A later version, using dynamic recompilation, was developed by Eric Traut, who later worked on successful emulation projects at Connectix such as Virtual Game Station and Virtual PC. Prior to Traut&#x27;s arrival there, Connectix had released Speed Doubler, which included an even faster PowerPC 68k emulator.

==Implementation==
All versions of this emulator emulated the &quot;user&quot; subset of the 68EC040 instruction set with a 68020/68030 exception stack frame. Apple developer documents indicate that the emulator provided an operating environment most closely resembling that of the Macintosh Centris 610, a system based on the Motorola 68LC040 microprocessor. Early versions emulated it by decoding each instruction and immediately carrying out a series of equivalent PowerPC instructions. For the PCI PowerMacs, the dynamic recompilation emulator was used to boost performance. Dynamic recompilation works by &quot;recompiling&quot; common sections of the code into faster, PowerPC-native, sequences that were locally cached. The emulator could recognise the same sequence of 680x0 code and run the previously-cached PowerPC code to avoid doing the translation again. This emulator was theoretically capable of emulating 680x0 code faster than any real 680x0 was capable of running it. The 68LC040 had no floating point instructions, making this feat slightly simpler but no less impressive.

One reason that this emulation was so successful is that many of the APIs for the Mac OS were originally implemented as traps on the 680x0 processor; therefore, calling an API actually was recognised by the 680x0 as the equivalent of an error condition, which would cause it to handle that error through one of its hardware vectors. In turn, this vector would look up and run the operating system routine from ROM or RAM. In the emulator, such traps could be replaced by native PowerPC code, so the only code being emulated was the application itself, and any system API it called could be accelerated with native PowerPC code. This also allowed Apple time to port the OS to the PowerPC. At first only time-critical aspects were rewritten in native code, leaving much of the OS emulated. Gradually most of the OS was rewritten to be native, so the OS got faster over time.

For the programmer, the transition to the PowerPC was made fairly painless, because the emulator was started and stopped automatically. This was achieved using a new type of pointer called a Universal Procedure Pointer (UPP). For 68k code, this pointer appeared to be an ordinary pointer to code and could be used as such. However, it actually led to a data structure which contained a special trap instruction and flags indicating the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the called code. From PowerPC code, this UPP could be passed to the CallUniversalProc( ) function to call it. The 68k emulator then dealt with details such as presenting passed parameters in the right order for the ISA in question, as well as starting and stopping the emulator as required. The compilers for Mac OS created such UPPs automatically when the proper macros were used, and the PowerPC system libraries contained native stubs to transparently call through to native or still-68k functions as needed. This meant that dealing with the dual architecture required very little work for the programmer, and just like the OS, applications themselves could mix and match 680x0 and PowerPC code fairly easily.

==Current status==
Because it was built into all PowerPC versions of the classic Mac OS, the emulator was also part of the Classic environment in Mac OS X. PowerPC Macintosh emulators such as SheepShaver therefore use the emulator as well when running the classic Mac OS. Native Mac OS X outside of Classic never used the emulator.

<text>The English Shepherd is a breed of herding dog from the United States.

==Description==
The English Shepherd is a medium-sized breed of dog, it weighs between and stands between , males are typically larger than females. The breed has a long, straight or wavy double coat with feathering on the legs and tail, traditionally it has four different color combinations, black and white, black and tan, sable and white or tricolor (black, white and tan), although shades of fawn and red tan to white are also seen in the breed. According to the breed standard, the coat may be straight, wavy or curly, except on the face, skull and front of legs where it is short and smooth.

==History==
The progenitors of the English Shepherd were collies of various types brought to the New World by early settlers from Britain and Ireland, as such it shares ancestry with the modern Border Collie, Rough Collie and Australian Shepherd. The ancestors of the English Shepherd were used extensively on farms throughout the eastern states, principally as a sheep and cattle herder, although it also performed the roles of watchdog, ratter and companion.

The United Kennel Club (UKC) has been registering English Shepherds since 1927, originally the UKC called the breed the American Farm Shepherd but in 2003 renamed it the English Shepherd. The breed is not recognized by the American Kennel Club.

<text>Eclampsia is the onset of seizures (convulsions) in a woman with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy that presents with three main features: new onset of high blood pressure, large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction, and edema. If left untreated, pre-eclampsia can result in long-term consequences for the mother, namely increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated complications. In more severe cases, it may be fatal for both the mother and the fetus.

The diagnostic criterion for pre-eclampsia is high blood pressure, occurring after 20 weeks gestation or during the second half of pregnancy. Most often it occurs during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and may occur before, during, or after delivery. The seizures are of the tonic–clonic type and typically last about a minute. Following the seizure, there is either a period of confusion or coma. Other complications include aspiration pneumonia, cerebral hemorrhage, kidney failure, pulmonary edema, HELLP syndrome, coagulopathy, placental abruption and cardiac arrest.
Low dose aspirin is recommended to prevent pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in those at high risk. Other preventative recommendations include calcium supplementation in areas with low calcium intake and treatment of prior hypertension with anti-hypertensive medications. Exercise during pregnancy may also be useful. The use of intravenous or intramuscular magnesium sulfate improves outcomes in those with severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia and is generally safe. Treatment options include blood pressure medications such as hydralazine and emergency delivery of the baby either vaginally or by cesarean section.
Pre-eclampsia is estimated to globally affect about 5% of deliveries while eclampsia affects about 1.4% of deliveries. In the developed world eclampsia rates are about 1 in 2,000 deliveries due to improved medical care whereas in developing countries it can impact 10–30 times as many women. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are one of the most common causes of death in pregnancy. They resulted in 46,900 deaths in 2015. Maternal mortality due to eclampsia occurs at a rate of approximately 0–1.8% of cases in high-income countries and up to 15% of cases in low- to middle- income countries. The word &quot;eclampsia&quot; is from the Greek term for lightning. The first known description of the condition was by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC.

==Signs and symptoms==

Eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy characterized by seizures in the setting of pre-eclampsia. Most women have premonitory signs/symptoms in the hours before the initial seizure. Typically the woman develops hypertension before the onset of a convulsion (seizure). Other signs and symptoms include:

* Long-lasting (persistent) frontal, occipital, or thunderclap headaches
* Visual disturbance (blurred vision, photophobia, diplopopia)
* Photophobia (discomfort from bright light)
* Abdominal pain, often in the epigastric region (the center of the abdomen above the navel) or in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen (below the right side of the rib cage)
* Altered mental status (confusion)
Any of these symptoms may be present before or after the seizure. It is also possible for the woman to be asymptomatic prior to the onset of the seizure.

Other cerebral signs that may precede the convulsion include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and cortical blindness. If the complication of multi-organ failure ensues, signs and symptoms of those failing organs will appear, such as abdominal pain, jaundice, shortness of breath, and diminished urine output.

=== Onset ===
The seizures of eclampsia typically present during pregnancy and prior to delivery (the antepartum period), but may also occur during labor and delivery (the intrapartum period) or after the baby has been delivered (the postpartum period). If postpartum seizures develop, it is most likely to occur within the first 48 hours after delivery. However, late postpartum seizures of eclampsia may occur as late as 4 weeks after delivery.

=== Characteristics ===
Eclamptic seizure is typically described as a tonic–clonic seizure which may cause an abrupt loss of consciousness at onset. This is often associated with a shriek or scream followed by stiffness of the muscles of the arms, legs, back and chest. During the tonic phase, the mother may begin to appear cyanotic. This presentation lasts for about a minute, after which the muscles begin in jerk and twitch for an additional one to two minutes. Other signs include tongue biting, frothy and bloody sputum coming out of the mouth.

=== Complications===
There are risks to both the mother and the fetus when eclampsia occurs. The fetus may grow more slowly than normal within the womb (uterus) of a woman with eclampsia, which is termed intrauterine growth restriction and may result in the child appearing small for gestational age or being born with low birth weight. Eclampsia may also cause problems with the placenta. The placenta may bleed (hemorrhage) or begin to separate early from the wall of the uterus. It is normal for the placenta to separate from the uterine wall during delivery, but it is abnormal for it to separate prior to delivery; this condition is called placental abruption and can be dangerous for the fetus. Placental insufficiency may also occur, a state in which the placenta fails to support appropriate fetal development because it cannot deliver the necessary amount of oxygen or nutrients to the fetus. During an eclamptic seizure, the beating of the fetal heart may become slower than normal (bradycardia). If any of these complications occurs, fetal distress may develop. Treatment of the mother&#x27;s seizures may also manage fetal bradycardia. If the risk to the health of the fetus or the mother is high, the definitive treatment for eclampsia is delivery of the baby. Delivery by cesarean section may be necessary, especially if the instance of fetal bradycardia does not resolve after 10 to 15 minutes of resuscitative interventions. It may be safer to deliver the infant preterm than to wait for the full 40 weeks of fetal development to finish, and as a result prematurity is also a potential complication of eclampsia.

In the mother, changes in vision may occur as a result of eclampsia, and these changes may include blurry vision, one-sided blindness (either temporary due to amaurosis fugax or potentially permanent due to retinal detachment), or cortical blindness, which affects the vision from both eyes. There are also potential complications in the lungs. The woman may have fluid slowly collecting in the lungs in a process known as pulmonary edema. During an eclamptic seizure, it is possible for a person to vomit the contents of the stomach and to inhale some of this material in a process known as aspiration. If aspiration occurs, the woman may experience difficulty breathing immediately or could develop an infection in the lungs later, called aspiration pneumonia. It is also possible that during a seizure breathing will stop temporarily or become inefficient, and the amount of oxygen reaching the woman&#x27;s body and brain will be decreased (in a state known as hypoxia). If it becomes difficult for the woman to breathe, she may need to have her breathing temporarily supported by an assistive device in a process called mechanical ventilation. In some severe eclampsia cases, the mother may become weak and sluggish (lethargy) or even comatose. These may be signs that the brain is swelling (cerebral edema) or bleeding (intracerebral hemorrhage).

==Risk factors==
Eclampsia, like pre-eclampsia, tends to occur more commonly in first pregnancies than subsequent pregnancies. Women who have long term high blood pressure before becoming pregnant have a greater risk of pre-eclampsia. Patients who have gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia have an increased risk of eclampsia. Furthermore, women with other pre-existing vascular diseases (diabetes or nephropathy) or thrombophilia disease such as the antiphospholipid syndrome are at higher risk to develop pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Having a placenta that is enlarged by multiple gestation or hydatidiform mole also increases risk of eclampsia. In addition, there is a genetic component: a woman whose mother or sister had the condition is at higher risk than otherwise. Patients who have experienced eclampsia are at increased risk for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia in a later pregnancy. The occurrence of pre-eclampsia was 5% in white, 9% in Hispanic, and 11% in African American patients and this may reflect disproportionate risk of developing pre-eclampsia among ethnic groups. Additionally, black patients were also shown to have a disproportionately higher risk of dying from eclampsia.

==Mechanism==

The mechanisms of eclampsia and preeclampsia are not definitively understood, but following provides some insight. The presence of a placenta is required, and eclampsia resolves if it is removed. Reduced blood flow to the placenta (placental hypoperfusion) may be a key feature of the process. It is typically accompanied by increased sensitivity of the maternal vasculature to agents which cause constriction of the small arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to multiple organs. Vascular dysfunction-associated maternal conditions such as Lupus, hypertension, and renal disease, or obstetric conditions that increase placental volume without an increase in placental blood flow (such as multifetal gestation) may increase risk for pre-eclampsia. Also, activation of the coagulation cascade can lead to microthrombi formation, which may further impair blood flow. Thirdly, increased vascular permeability results in the shift of extracellular fluid from the blood to the interstitial space which reduces blood flow and causes edema. These events can lead to hypertension, renal dysfunction, pulmonary dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, and cerebral edema with cerebral dysfunction and convulsions. In clinical context, increased platelet and endothelial activation may be detected before symptoms appear.

Hypoperfusion of the placenta is associated with abnormal modelling of the fetal–maternal placental interface that may be immunologically mediated. The pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia is poorly understood and may be attributed to factors related to the woman and placenta since pre-eclampsia is seen in molar pregnancies absent of a fetus or fetal tissue. The placenta normally produces the potent vasodilator adrenomedullin but it is reduced in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Other vasodilators, including prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, nitric oxide, and endothelins, are reduced in eclampsia and may lead to vasoconstriction.

Eclampsia is associated with hypertensive encephalopathy in which cerebral vascular resistance is reduced, leading to increased blood flow to the brain, cerebral edema and resultant convulsions. An eclamptic convulsion usually does not cause chronic brain damage unless intracranial haemorrhage occurs.

==Diagnosis==
If a pregnant woman has already been diagnosed with pre-eclampsia during the current pregnancy and then develops a seizure, she may be assigned a &#x27;clinical diagnosis&#x27; of eclampsia without further workup. While seizures are most common in the third trimester, they may occur any time from 20 weeks of pregnancy until 6 weeks after birth. Because pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are common conditions in women, eclampsia can be assumed to be the correct diagnosis until proven otherwise in pregnant or postpartum women who experience seizures. However, if a woman has a seizure and it is unknown whether or not they have pre-eclampsia, testing can help make the diagnosis clear.

Pre-eclampsia is diagnosed when repeated blood pressure measurements are greater or equal to 140/90mmHg, in addition to any signs of organ dysfunction, including: proteinuria, thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, cerebral symptoms, or abdominal pain.

=== Vital signs ===
One of the core features of pre-eclampsia is the new onset of high blood pressure. Blood pressure is a measurement of two numbers: systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. A systolic blood pressure (the top number) of greater than 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) of greater than 90 mmHg is higher than the normal range. If the blood pressure is high on at least two separate occasions after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy and the woman has signs of organ dysfunction (e.g. proteinuria), then they meet the criteria for a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. If the systolic blood pressure is greater than 160 or the diastolic pressure is greater than 110, the hypertension is considered to be severe.

=== Laboratory testing ===
Another common feature of pre-eclampsia is proteinuria, which is the presence of excess protein in the urine. To determine if proteinuria is present, the urine can be collected and tested for protein; if there is 0.3 grams of protein or more in the urine of a pregnant woman collected over 24 hours, this is one of the diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia and raises the suspicion that a seizure is due to eclampsia.

In cases of severe eclampsia or pre-eclampsia, the woman can have low levels of platelets in the blood, a condition termed thrombocytopenia. A complete blood count, or CBC, is a test of the blood that can be performed to check platelet levels.

Other investigations include: kidney function test, liver function tests (LFT), coagulation screen, 24-hour urine creatinine, and fetal/placental ultrasound.

=== Differential diagnosis===
Convulsions during pregnancy that are unrelated to pre-eclampsia need to be distinguished from eclampsia. Such disorders include seizure disorders as well as brain tumor, aneurysm of the brain, and medication- or drug-related seizures. Usually, the presence of the signs of severe pre-eclampsia precede and accompany eclampsia, facilitating the diagnosis.

==Prevention==
Detection and management of pre-eclampsia is critical to reduce the risk of eclampsia. The USPSTF recommends regular checking of blood pressure through pregnancy in order to detect preeclampsia. Appropriate management of a woman with pre-eclampsia generally involves the use of magnesium sulfate to prevent eclamptic seizures. In some cases, low-dose aspirin has been shown to decrease the risk of pre-eclampsia in women, especially when taken in the late first trimester.

==Treatment==
The four goals of the treatment of eclampsia are to stop and prevent further convulsions, to control the elevated blood pressure, to deliver the baby as promptly as possible, and to monitor closely for the onset of multi-organ failure.

===Convulsions===
Convulsions are prevented and treated using magnesium sulfate. The study demonstrating the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate for the management of eclampsia was first published in 1955. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/L, however the ideal dosing regime (dose, route of administration, timing of dosing) to prevent and treat eclampsia is not clear.

With intravenous administration, the onset of anticonvulsant action is fast and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action is about one hour and lasts for three to four hours. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidneys at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration (concentration in the blood) and glomerular filtration (rate at which the blood is filtered through the kidneys). Magnesium sulfate is associated with several minor side effects; serious side effects are uncommon, occurring at elevated magnesium serum concentrations greater than 7.0 mEq/L. Serious toxicity can be counteracted with calcium gluconate.

Even with therapeutic serum magnesium concentrations, recurrent convulsions may occur, and additional magnesium may be needed, but with close monitoring for respiratory, cardiac, and neurological depression. If magnesium administration with resultant high serum concentrations fails to control convulsions, the addition of other intravenous anticonvulsants may be used and intubation and mechanical ventilation may be initiated. It is important to avoid magnesium toxicity, including thoracic muscle paralysis, which could cause respiratory failure and death.

Magnesium sulfate results in better outcomes than diazepam, phenytoin or a combination of chlorpromazine, promethazine, and pethidine.

===Blood pressure management===
Blood pressure is controlled to prevent stroke, which accounts for 15 to 20 percent of deaths in women with eclampsia. Common drugs used for blood pressure control during eclampsia are hydralazine or labetalol, due to their effectiveness, lack of negative effects on the fetus, and mechanism of action. Blood pressure management is indicated with a diastolic blood pressure above 105–110 mm Hg. Normal blood pressure levels for pregnant women vary between trimesters and as so blood pressure management will be tailored accordingly.

===Delivery===
If the baby has not yet been delivered, steps need to be taken to stabilize the woman and deliver her speedily. This needs to be done even if the baby is immature, as the eclamptic condition is unsafe for both baby and mother. As eclampsia is a manifestation of a type of non-infectious multiorgan dysfunction or failure, other organs (liver, kidney, lungs, cardiovascular system, and coagulation system) need to be assessed in preparation for a delivery (often a caesarean section), unless the woman is already in advanced labor. Regional anesthesia for caesarean section is contraindicated when a coagulopathy has developed.

There is limited to no evidence in favor of a particular delivery method for women with eclampsia. Therefore, the delivery method of choice is an individualized decision.

===Monitoring===
Invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be elected in an eclamptic woman at risk for or with heart disease, kidney disease, refractory hypertension, pulmonary edema, or poor urine output.

==Etymology==
The Greek noun , , denotes a &quot;light burst&quot;; metaphorically, in this context, &quot;sudden occurrence.&quot; The Neo-Latin term first appeared in Johannes Varandaeus’ 1620 treatise on gynaecology &quot;Tractatus de affectibus Renum et Vesicae&quot;. The term &#x27;toxemia of pregnancy&#x27; is no longer recommended: placental toxins are not the cause of eclampsia occurrences, as previously believed.

==Notable deaths from eclampsia==
*Tori Bowie (fetus died too)

==Popular culture==

* In &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, a historical drama television series, the character Lady Sybil dies (in series 3, episode 5) of eclampsia shortly after child birth.
* In &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;, a medical drama television series set in London in the 1950s and 1960s, the character (in series 1, episode 4) named Margaret Jones is struck with pre-eclampsia, ultimately proceeding from a comatose condition to death. The term &quot;toxemia&quot; was also used for the condition, in the dialogue.

<text>In mathematical physics, a lattice model is a mathematical model of a physical system that is defined on a lattice, as opposed to a continuum, such as the continuum of space or spacetime. Lattice models originally occurred in the context of condensed matter physics, where the atoms of a crystal automatically form a lattice. Currently, lattice models are quite popular in theoretical physics, for many reasons. Some models are exactly solvable, and thus offer insight into physics beyond what can be learned from perturbation theory. Lattice models are also ideal for study by the methods of computational physics, as the discretization of any continuum model automatically turns it into a lattice model. The exact solution to many of these models (when they are solvable) includes the presence of solitons. Techniques for solving these include the inverse scattering transform and the method of Lax pairs, the Yang–Baxter equation and quantum groups. The solution of these models has given insights into the nature of phase transitions, magnetization and scaling behaviour, as well as insights into the nature of quantum field theory. Physical lattice models frequently occur as an approximation to a continuum theory, either to give an ultraviolet cutoff to the theory to prevent divergences or to perform numerical computations. An example of a continuum theory that is widely studied by lattice models is the QCD lattice model, a discretization of quantum chromodynamics. However, digital physics considers nature fundamentally discrete at the Planck scale, which imposes , aka Holographic principle. More generally, lattice gauge theory and lattice field theory are areas of study. Lattice models are also used to simulate the structure and dynamics of polymers.

==Mathematical description==
A number of lattice models can be described by the following data:
* A lattice formula_1, often taken to be a lattice in formula_2-dimensional Euclidean space formula_3 or the formula_2-dimensional torus if the lattice is periodic. Concretely, formula_1 is often the cubic lattice. If two points on the lattice are considered &#x27;nearest neighbours&#x27;, then they can be connected by an edge, turning the lattice into a lattice graph. The vertices of formula_1 are sometimes referred to as sites.
* A spin-variable space formula_7. The configuration space formula_8 of possible system states is then the space of functions formula_9. For some models, we might instead consider instead the space of functions formula_10 where formula_11 is the edge set of the graph defined above.
* An energy functional formula_12, which might depend on a set of additional parameters or &#x27;coupling constants&#x27; formula_13.
===Examples===
The Ising model is given by the usual cubic lattice graph formula_14 where formula_1 is an infinite cubic lattice in formula_3 or a period formula_17 cubic lattice in formula_18, and formula_11 is the edge set of nearest neighbours (the same letter is used for the energy functional but the different usages are distinguishable based on context). The spin-variable space is formula_20. The energy functional is 
:formula_21

The spin-variable space can often be described as a coset. For example, for the Potts model we have formula_22. In the limit formula_23, we obtain the XY model which has formula_24. Generalising the XY model to higher dimensions gives the formula_17-vector model which has formula_26.

===Solvable models===
We specialise to a lattice with a finite number of points, and a finite spin-variable space. This can be achieved by making the lattice periodic, with period formula_17 in formula_2 dimensions. Then the configuration space formula_8 is also finite. We can define the partition function
:formula_30
and there are no issues of convergence (like those which emerge in field theory) since the sum is finite. In theory, this sum can be computed to obtain an expression which is dependent only on the parameters formula_13 and formula_32. In practice, this is often difficult due to non-linear interactions between sites. Models with a closed-form expression for the partition function are known as exactly solvable.

Examples of exactly solvable models are the periodic 1D Ising model, and the periodic 2D Ising model with vanishing external magnetic field, formula_33 but for dimension formula_34, the Ising model remains unsolved.

===Mean field theory===
Due to the difficulty of deriving exact solutions, in order to obtain analytic results we often must resort to mean field theory. This mean field may be spatially varying, or global. 
====Global mean field====
The configuration space formula_8 of functions formula_36 is replaced by the convex hull of the spin space formula_7, when formula_7 has a realisation in terms of a subset of formula_39. We&#x27;ll denote this by formula_40. This arises as in going to the mean value of the field, we have formula_41. 

As the number of lattice sites formula_42, the possible values of formula_43 fill out the convex hull of formula_7. By making a suitable approximation, the energy functional becomes a function of the mean field, that is, formula_45 The partition function then becomes
:formula_46
As formula_47, that is, in the thermodynamic limit, the saddle point approximation tells us the integral is asymptotically dominated by the value at which formula_48 is minimised:
:formula_49
where formula_50 is the argument minimising formula_51.

A simpler, but less mathematically rigorous approach which nevertheless sometimes gives correct results comes from linearising the theory about the mean field formula_52. Writing configurations as formula_53, truncating terms of formula_54 then summing over configurations allows computation of the partition function.

Such an approach to the periodic Ising model in formula_2 dimensions provides insight into phase transitions.
====Spatially varying mean field====
Suppose the continuum limit of the lattice formula_1 is formula_3. Instead of averaging over all of formula_1, we average over neighbourhoods of formula_59. This gives a spatially varying mean field formula_60. We relabel formula_52 with formula_62 to bring the notation closer to field theory. This allows the partition function to be written as a path integral
:formula_63
where the free energy formula_64 is a Wick rotated version of the action in quantum field theory.

<text>An audience is a formal meeting that takes place between a head of state and another person at the invitation of the head of state. Often, the invitation follows a request for a meeting from the other person. Though sometimes used in republics to describe meetings with presidents, the term is more usually associated with monarchs and popes.

==Holy See==
In the past, rigid dress codes had to be followed by those granted a papal audience. For a general audience, smart business professional attire (technically, informal wear, that is, a suit and tie or equivalent for ladies) was acceptable. The suit was to be dark, and ladies would ideally not wear slacks anywhere in the Vatican. Private audiences, however, were a much more formal affair. Ladies were to wear a long (well below the knees), black dress, with a matching hat or other head covering and veil. Exceptions were made for Catholic queens who by dispensation could wear white (&quot;privilège du blanc&quot;). Gentlemen were to wear a correct morning suit, either black or very dark gray with the traditional striped trousers, patent leather shoes, and cutaway. An ascot or equivalent formal tie would be worn with a gray waistcoat over a white dress shirt with arrow collars. If any part of the audience were to occur outdoors, a black top hat would be worn. If the function were entirely indoors, then the hat was optional for men. Both gentlemen and ladies were to wear dress gloves. Evening functions were usually white tie.

Formal dress is now normally reserved for diplomatic audiences. In the 1990s, an Irish Catholic priest provoked a controversy by claiming that the president of his country, Mary Robinson, had breached protocol by wearing jewellery and by not wearing black nor a mantilla for an audience with Pope John Paul II. The Vatican subsequently pointed out that the traditional form of dress worn for papal audiences was no longer obligatory.

Modern popes grant large audiences to crowds in St. Peter&#x27;s Square or the Paul VI Audience Hall.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, audiences with the British monarch are usually listed in the Court Circular, which is published daily by the broadsheet press. The Prime Minister has a weekly audience with the monarch usually every Wednesday, during parliamentary time at Buckingham Palace.

==Denmark==
In the Kingdom of Denmark, public audiences with the King usually take place every other Monday at Christiansborg Palace. An invitation is not required for public audiences. Private audiences of the King with heads of state, heads of government, parliamentary delegations, leaders of international organisations and military leaders are usually held at the residence palace of the Monarch at Amalienborg Palace.

<doc id="291495" wikidata="Q26731" url="?curid=291495" title="Tancred of Hauteville">
<text>Tancred of Hauteville (c. 980 – 1041) was an 11th-century Norman lord. Little is known about him, and he is best remembered by the achievements of his twelve sons. Various legends arose about Tancred, but they have no supporting contemporary evidence that has survived the ages.

==Life and marriages==
Tancred was a minor landowner in Normandy. Goffredo Malaterra says that he was a knight of very noble lineage, who inherited the village of Hauteville (probably Hauteville-la-Guichard, north-west of Coutances, in Normandy) from his ancestors. On the other hand, Anna Komnene, in the Alexiad, describes his son Robert as of insignificant origin.

In his youth, Tancred dedicated himself to his military abilities, and jumped through a number of different courts. Supposedly, while residing at the court of Richard II, Duke of Normandy, he went hunting with him, and heroically killed a boar. Instead of being punished (as it was medieval custom that only the duke could slay the hunt’s target), Tancred was praised for his actions. From then on, he served in the duke’s court, commanding a small group of ten knights on his behalf. Aside from this tale, little else is known about him, and he doesn&#x27;t seem to have had any exceptional characteristic, aside from his persistent fecundity.

His first wife was a certain Muriella, whom Malaterra records being &quot;distinguished for her morals and noble birth&quot;. When Muriella died, Tancred married Fressenda, whom, according to Malaterra, &quot;in birth and morals was by no means inferior to his first wife&quot;. Malaterra specifies the reasons of Tancred&#x27;s choice to remarry:

==Issue==
With his first wife, Muriella, he had at least five sons:
*Serlo I, succeeded him as Seigneur of Hauteville-la-Guichard
*Geoffrey, Count of the Capitanate
*William Iron Arm, Count of Apulia (d. 1046)
*Drogo, Count of Apulia and Calabria (d. 1051)
*Humphrey, Count of Apulia and Calabria (d. 1057)
With his second wife, Fressenda, he had at least eight more sons and one daughter:
*Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia and Calabria (d. 1085)
*Mauger, count of the Capitanate (d. 1064)
*Fressenda, who married Richard I, Prince of Capua 
*William, count of the Principate (d. 1080)
*Aubrey
*Hubert
*Tancred
*Frumentin
*Roger, count of Sicily (d. 1101)

Finally, the &quot;Annales&quot; of Romuald Guarna state that Tancred had three daughters, but without naming them or stating by which marriage they were born. One of these daughters is the Fressenda named above, who married Richard I of Capua. One of the two remaining daughters is sometimes given the name Beatrice, and has been erroneously identified as the mother of Geoffrey, Count of Conversano. All of the informations regarding her are dubious.

<doc id="291498" wikidata="Q464052" url="?curid=291498" title="Samantha Fox">
<text>Samantha Karen Fox (born 15 April 1966) is an English pop singer and former glamour model from Crouch End in North London. She has appeared on a number of reality television shows—including &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!,&quot; &quot;Celebrity Big Brother, Celebrity Wife Swap&quot; and &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;—and has occasionally worked as a television presenter and actress.

After placing second in a &quot;Sunday People&quot; amateur modelling contest, Fox rose to fame as a topless Page 3 model in &quot;The Sun&quot;, where she made her first appearance in February 1983, aged 16. During her time on Page 3, she became one of the most photographed British women of the 1980s and a prominent sex symbol; she was named &quot;Page 3 Girl of the Year&quot; for 1984, 1985 and 1986, and insured her breasts for £1 million. She left Page 3 in 1986, aged 20, to focus on her pop music career, but made occasional glamour modeling appearances thereafter, notably featuring in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in 1996. In 2008, she was voted the top Page 3 model of all time.

Released in March 1986, her debut single for the Jive Records label, &quot;Touch Me (I Want Your Body)&quot;, became a top-10 hit across Europe, North America and Australia, reaching number one in several countries. Her first three studio albums—&quot;Touch Me&quot; (1986), &quot;Samantha Fox&quot; (1987) and &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; (1988)—all produced international hit singles; she was nominated in the British Female Solo Artist category at the Brit Awards 1988. Her subsequent albums—&quot;Just One Night&quot; (1991), &quot;21st Century Fox&quot; (1997) and &quot;Angel with an Attitude&quot; (2005)—were less successful, but she has continued to tour and has announced a forthcoming seventh studio album, produced by Ian Masterson.

In her early career, Fox dated men including Peter Foster, the Australian fraudster, and Paul Stanley, the rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of rock band Kiss. Following persistent rumours in the 1990s about her sexual orientation, she came out as a lesbian in 2003. She was in a long-term relationship with her former manager Myra Stratton from 2003 until Stratton&#x27;s death from cancer in 2015. In 2022, she married her tour manager, Linda Birgitte Olsen.

== Early life ==
Fox was born on 15 April 1966, the eldest child of John Patrick Fox, a builder, and Carole Ann Wilken, an actress and former dancer on the 1960s pop music programme &quot;Ready, Steady, Go!&quot; She grew up in Crouch End in North London, later describing her background as &quot;a working-class market-trader family&quot;.

Fox took an interest in the theatre from an early age, attending the Anna Scher Theatre School from age five, and subsequently attending Mountview Theatre School. She also attended St Thomas More Catholic School, Wood Green. She formed her first pop band when she was 14 and signed her first record deal with Lamborghini Records at age 15.

== Career ==
=== Modelling ===
Fox&#x27;s &quot;glamour&quot; modelling career began at age 16 when her mother took photographs of her wearing lingerie and submitted them to &quot;The Sunday People&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Face and Shape of &#x27;83&quot; amateur modelling contest. After Fox placed second, a photographer for &quot;The Sun&quot; invited her to pose topless for Page 3; at the time, she was the youngest person to model topless for the feature. British publications could then legally feature topless models aged 16 and older, although the minimum age was raised to 18 in May 2004. 

Fox later said she was grateful for the opportunity to break into &quot;glamour&quot; modelling, since many people in her area were unemployed or had &quot;rough, low-paying jobs”. She had previously considered joining the police, but at tall she did not meet the height requirement then in place of for female officers. Having become comfortable with sunbathing topless on European beaches, she later said that she did not consider topless modeling a &quot;big deal&quot;.

Fox&#x27;s first Page 3 photograph appeared in &quot;The Sun&quot; on 22 February 1983, under the headline &quot;Sam, 16, Quits A-Levels for Ooh-Levels&quot;. She signed a four-year modelling contract with &quot;The&quot; &quot;Sun&quot; and was named &quot;Page 3 Girl of the Year&quot; in 1984, 1985 and 1986. She also made modelling appearances in multiple men&#x27;s magazines. During her glamour modelling career, she insured her breasts for £1 million, inspired by Betty Grable insuring her legs for $1 million. In 1985, she appeared in a David Cassidy music video and modelled for an accompanying photoshoot, but later said that Cassidy had sexually assaulted her during the shoot and again in the toilets of a restaurant.

Fox left Page 3 in 1986, aged 20, to focus on her singing career. She made occasional glamour modelling appearances later in her career, including a nude photoshoot for the October 1996 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; when she was aged 30. She is recognised as the most popular pin-up girl of her era, as well as one of the most photographed British women of the 1980s, alongside Diana, Princess of Wales, and Margaret Thatcher. In 2008, she was voted the top Page 3 girl of all time.

=== Singing ===
Fox attempted to launch a music career in 1983. Her first single, credited to S.F.X., was a cover version of the 1981 Lesley Jayne song &quot;Rocking with My Radio&quot;, released on the Lamborghini Records label. It was produced by Ian Gillan Band and Spencer Davis Group member Ray Fenwick, who also wrote the B-side, &quot;My Old Man&quot;. Fox continued her collaboration with Fenwick, releasing her second single, &quot;Aim to Win&quot;, under her own name in 1984. Neither of these singles was successful. Fox later said that &quot;[Lamborghini Records] didn&#x27;t really have a clue in those days and I didn&#x27;t either,&quot; but said that the experience of performing live benefited her later musical career. Songs from her early Lamborghini Records singles were included as bonus tracks on the 2012 deluxe reissue of her album &quot;Touch Me&quot;.

In 1986, Fox was invited to an open audition for Jive Records, which was seeking a &quot;British Madonna&quot; to record the track &quot;Touch Me (I Want Your Body)&quot;. Released as a single in March 1986, the song became an instant hit, reaching the top 10 across Europe and topping the charts in multiple countries. In the UK, the song reached number 3 in the charts, and in the US it reached number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Her second single, &quot;Do Ya Do Ya (Wanna Please Me)&quot;, also reached the top 10 in the UK. Jive Records offered her a five-album deal. Her debut album, &quot;Touch Me&quot;, peaked at number 17 in the UK and charted all over Europe, reaching number one in Finland. The album received mixed reviews from critics, but Fox dismissed the criticism, claiming that music critics routinely disapproved of attractive artists; she called female critics &quot;plain, drab women without any sex appeal&quot; and said that male critics &quot;look like Elvis Costello&quot;.

Her second album, &quot;Samantha Fox&quot;, released in 1987, featured the hit singles &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Me Now&quot; (UK #8) and &quot;Naughty Girls (Need Love Too)&quot; (US #3). The former song was produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, while the latter was remixed by US production duo Full Force. At the Brit Awards 1988, Fox was nominated in the British Female Solo Artist category alongside Kate Bush, Alison Moyet, Sinitta, and Kim Wilde. The award went to Moyet. Her third album, &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun,&quot; released later in 1988, featured the hits &quot;I Only Wanna Be With You&quot; (UK #16) and &quot;I Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; (US #8). The album also charted in both the UK and US. By the end of the decade, Fox had achieved three top-10 singles in both the UK and US and three gold albums in the latter. She continued to have notable success in Australia and Europe.

Fox&#x27;s record sales declined sharply after the 1980s. She released three further studio albums, &quot;Just One Night&quot; in 1991, &quot;21st Century Fox&quot; in 1997, and &quot;Angel with an Attitude&quot; in 2005, but none produced any hits. A &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album was issued in 2009, both in single and double CD formats. In 2012, her first four albums were remastered and reissued as double deluxe CDs by Cherry Red, with the addition of remixes and previously unreleased tracks. In 2022, Fox announced that she was working on a seventh studio album, produced by Ian Masterson, that would include a song co-written with Steve Strange as well as songs co-written with Ricky Wilde, brother of Kim Wilde.

In addition to her solo career, Fox collaborated with Cris Bonacci (former lead guitarist for the all-female rock band Girlschool) and Lauraine McIntosh to form the short-lived band Sox. They entered A Song for Europe, the UK&#x27;s pre-selection competition for the 1995 Eurovision Song Contest, coming in fourth place out of eight songs with their entry &quot;Go for the Heart&quot;. Sox released the song as a single before disbanding. Fox collaborated on &quot;Santa Maria&quot; by DJ Milano, a 1997 cover version of the original 1995 song by Croatian-Dutch model and singer Tatjana. She collaborated with Swedish singer Günther, who recorded a cover version of her 1986 hit &quot;Touch Me (I Want Your Body)&quot; for his 2004 album &quot;Pleasureman&quot;. His version features new vocals by Fox, who also appeared in the music video. In 2022, she contributed co-lead vocals on the track &quot;Tomorrow&quot; with Swedish band Nestor, which was included on their album &quot;Kids in a Ghost Town.&quot; In August 2023, she toured in the United States with Bad Boys Blue and Boney M, appearing in cities including New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Jose.

=== Film and television ===
Fox has done occasional film and television work. She and Mick Fleetwood co-presented the Brit Awards 1989, a live BBC broadcast that was subsequently described as &quot;chaotic&quot; and an &quot;epic shambles&quot;. The presenters repeatedly missed cues and made incorrect introductions, including failing to show a recorded message from Michael Jackson and introducing Boy George as the Four Tops. Fox later claimed that the presenters were given cards containing incorrect information, that the autocue was malfunctioning, that female Bros fans disrupted the show with continuous screaming, and that her co-presenter was &quot;out of it&quot;.

In 1990, Fox appeared on the American sitcom &quot;Charles in Charge&quot; as Samantha Steele, a fictional rock star. She also featured in &quot;The Match&quot; (1999), &quot;7 Cases&quot; (2015), and the comedy horror film &quot;Sharknado 5: Global Swarming&quot; (2017). In 1995 she guest-starred in the Hindi film &quot;Rock Dancer&quot;. In 2008, Fox and her then-partner Myra Stratton took part in &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;, exchanging with Freddie Starr and his wife Donna. In November 2009, she participated in ITV&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;; she was voted out on day 16. In 2010, she appeared in a celebrity episode of &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; with Calum Best, Janice Dickinson, and Jeff Brazier. In 2016, she featured in &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 18,&quot; finishing in seventh place. In 2023, she appeared on &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;.

=== Charitable activity ===
In 2008, Fox donated her favourite bra to a charity auction. In 2011, she participated in a campaign for the LGBT charity the Albert Kennedy Trust.

== Personal life ==

Fox&#x27;s parents separated in 1988. Her father, who abused alcohol and cocaine, managed her career prior to 1991. In that year, he assaulted her, leaving her with cuts, bruises, and two broken ribs. Following that incident, she hired accountants to trace over £1 million that she believed he had embezzled from her accounts. She discovered that her father had moved her money into offshore bank accounts and had not paid tax on her earnings for a decade. She sued and was awarded a £363,000 court settlement in 1995, although those funds were used to settle her tax bill. She spoke to her father only once during the last decade of his life; he died in 2000. Fox had one full sibling; she also has two half-siblings from her father&#x27;s second marriage. 

In her early career, Fox had relationships with a number of men. She dated the Australian fraudster Peter Foster but turned down his marriage proposal, later saying: &quot;My parents had split and here was a man who was clever, manipulative and domineering. I came close to marrying him because I was so vulnerable.&quot; She was also linked to Kit Miller, a journalist; Rafi Camino, a Spanish bullfighter; and Paul Stanley, the rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of the American rock band Kiss. However, her sexual orientation was publicly called into question in 1999, after she judged a lesbian beauty pageant. At the time, she was living with her musical collaborator Cris Bonacci, who was rumoured to be her lover. Bonacci later confirmed that she and Fox were secretly in a relationship for four and a half years. In 2003, Fox came out as a lesbian and confirmed that she was in a relationship with her then-manager Myra Stratton. Fox later said she had realised she was gay in her mid-20s but had been reluctant to come out because, having dealt with stalkers, she feared the reactions of some fans. Stratton died from cancer in 2015, aged 60. The following year, Fox began dating her tour manager Linda Birgitte Olsen, a native of Norway. They became engaged on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 2020, after Olsen proposed, but postponed their wedding due to COVID-19 restrictions. They married on 18 June 2022 in a Eurovision-themed ceremony at King&#x27;s Oak Hotel in Epping Forest, Essex.

In March 2023, Fox&#x27;s younger sister Vanessa died at age 50, nine days after suffering a heart attack.

In December 2023, police officers arrested Fox at Heathrow Airport after her conduct prevented the departure of an evening British Airways flight to Hamburg. At Uxbridge Magistrates&#x27; Court in April 2024, she pleaded guilty to charges of drunk and disorderly conduct on a plane and to threatening and abusive behaviour towards a police officer. She denied assaulting her wife on the plane, and prosecutors dropped the assault charge after changes in evidence. In September 2024, she was sentenced to a 12-month community order, including a £1,000 fine and up to 25 rehabilitation activity requirement days. She was also ordered to pay £1,718.09 in compensation to British Airways, £100 to the police officer she had threatened, £85 in costs, and a £114 victim surcharge.

<doc id="291499" wikidata="Q849737" url="?curid=291499" title="Single-photon emission computed tomography">
<text>Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT, or less commonly, SPET) is a nuclear medicine tomographic imaging technique using gamma rays. It is very similar to conventional nuclear medicine planar imaging using a gamma camera (that is, scintigraphy), but is able to provide true 3D information. This information is typically presented as cross-sectional slices through the patient, but can be freely reformatted or manipulated as required.

The technique needs delivery of a gamma-emitting radioisotope (a radionuclide) into the patient, normally through injection into the bloodstream. On occasion, the radioisotope is a simple soluble dissolved ion, such as an isotope of gallium(III). Usually, though, a marker radioisotope is attached to a specific ligand to create a radioligand, whose properties bind it to certain types of tissues. This marriage allows the combination of ligand and radiopharmaceutical to be carried and bound to a place of interest in the body, where the ligand concentration is seen by a gamma camera.

==Principles==
Instead of just &quot;taking a picture of anatomical structures&quot;, a SPECT scan monitors level of biological activity at each place in the 3-D region analyzed. Emissions from the radionuclide indicate amounts of blood flow in the capillaries of the imaged regions. In the same way that a plain X-ray is a 2-dimensional (2-D) view of a 3-dimensional structure, the image obtained by a gamma camera is a 2-D view of 3-D distribution of a radionuclide.

SPECT imaging is performed by using a gamma camera to acquire multiple 2-D images (also called projections), from multiple angles. A computer is then used to apply a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to the multiple projections, yielding a 3-D data set. This data set may then be manipulated to show thin slices along any chosen axis of the body, similar to those obtained from other tomographic techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT), and positron emission tomography (PET).

SPECT is similar to PET in its use of radioactive tracer material and detection of gamma rays. In contrast with PET, the tracers used in SPECT emit gamma radiation that is measured directly, whereas PET tracers emit positrons that annihilate with electrons up to a few millimeters away, causing two gamma photons to be emitted in opposite directions. A PET scanner detects these emissions &quot;coincident&quot; in time, which provides more radiation event localization information and, thus, higher spatial resolution images than SPECT (which has about 1 cm resolution). SPECT scans are significantly less expensive than PET scans, in part because they are able to use longer-lived and more easily obtained radioisotopes than PET.

Because SPECT acquisition is very similar to planar gamma camera imaging, the same radiopharmaceuticals may be used. If a patient is examined in another type of nuclear medicine scan, but the images are non-diagnostic, it may be possible to proceed straight to SPECT by moving the patient to a SPECT instrument, or even by simply reconfiguring the camera for SPECT image acquisition while the patient remains on the table.
To acquire SPECT images, the gamma camera is rotated around the patient. Projections are acquired at defined points during the rotation, typically every 3–6 degrees. In most cases, a full 360-degree rotation is used to obtain an optimal reconstruction. The time taken to obtain each projection is also variable, but 15–20 seconds is typical. This gives a total scan time of 15–20 minutes.

Multi-headed gamma cameras can accelerate acquisition. For example, a dual-headed camera can be used with heads spaced 180 degrees apart, allowing two projections to be acquired simultaneously, with each head requiring 180 degrees of rotation. Triple-head cameras with 120-degree spacing are also used.

Cardiac gated acquisitions are possible with SPECT, just as with planar imaging techniques such as multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA). Triggered by electrocardiogram (EKG) to obtain differential information about the heart in various parts of its cycle, gated myocardial SPECT can be used to obtain quantitative information about myocardial perfusion, thickness, and contractility of the myocardium during various parts of the cardiac cycle, and also to allow calculation of left ventricular ejection fraction, stroke volume, and cardiac output.

==Application==
SPECT can be used to complement any gamma imaging study, where a true 3D representation can be helpful, such as tumor imaging, infection (leukocyte) imaging, thyroid imaging or bone scintigraphy.

Because SPECT permits accurate localisation in 3D space, it can be used to provide information about localised function in internal organs, such as functional cardiac or brain imaging.

===Myocardial perfusion imaging===
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a form of functional cardiac imaging, used for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. The underlying principle is that under conditions of stress, diseased myocardium receives less blood flow than normal myocardium. MPI is one of several types of cardiac stress test.

A cardiac specific radiopharmaceutical is administered, e.g., 99mTc-tetrofosmin (Myoview, GE healthcare), 99mTc-sestamibi (Cardiolite, Bristol-Myers Squibb) or Thallium-201 chloride. Following this, the heart rate is raised to induce myocardial stress, either by exercise on a treadmill or pharmacologically with adenosine, dobutamine, or dipyridamole (aminophylline can be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole).

SPECT imaging performed after stress reveals the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical, and therefore the relative blood flow to the different regions of the myocardium. Diagnosis is made by comparing stress images to a further set of images obtained at rest which are normally acquired prior to the stress images.

MPI has been demonstrated to have an overall accuracy of about 83% (sensitivity: 85%; specificity: 72%) (in a review, not exclusively of SPECT MPI), and is comparable with (or better than) other non-invasive tests for ischemic heart disease.

===Functional brain imaging===
Usually, the gamma-emitting tracer used in functional brain imaging is Technetium (99mTc) exametazime. 99mTc is a metastable nuclear isomer that emits gamma rays detectable by a gamma camera. Attaching it to exametazime allows it to be taken up by brain tissue in a manner proportional to brain blood flow, in turn allowing cerebral blood flow to be assessed with the nuclear gamma camera.

Because blood flow in the brain is tightly coupled to local brain metabolism and energy use, the 99mTc-exametazime tracer (as well as the similar 99mTc-EC tracer) is used to assess brain metabolism regionally, in an attempt to diagnose and differentiate the different causal pathologies of dementia. Meta-analysis of many reported studies suggests that SPECT with this tracer is about 74% sensitive at diagnosing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease vs. 81% sensitivity for clinical exam (cognitive testing, etc.). More recent studies have shown the accuracy of SPECT in Alzheimer&#x27;s diagnosis may be as high as 88%. In meta analysis, SPECT was superior to clinical exam and clinical criteria (91% vs. 70%) in being able to differentiate Alzheimer&#x27;s disease from vascular dementias. This latter ability relates to SPECT&#x27;s imaging of local metabolism of the brain, in which the patchy loss of cortical metabolism seen in multiple strokes differs clearly from the more even or &quot;smooth&quot; loss of non-occipital cortical brain function typical of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Another recent review article showed that multi-headed SPECT cameras with quantitative analysis result in an overall sensitivity of 84-89% and an overall specificity of 83-89% in cross sectional studies and sensitivity of 82-96% and specificity of 83-89% for longitudinal studies of dementia.

99mTc-exametazime SPECT scanning competes with fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scanning of the brain, which works to assess regional brain glucose metabolism, to provide very similar information about local brain damage from many processes. SPECT is more widely available, because the radioisotope used is longer-lasting and far less expensive in SPECT, and the gamma scanning equipment is less expensive as well. While 99mTc is extracted from relatively simple technetium-99m generators, which are delivered to hospitals and scanning centers weekly to supply fresh radioisotope, FDG PET relies on FDG, which is made in an expensive medical cyclotron and &quot;hot-lab&quot; (automated chemistry lab for radiopharmaceutical manufacture), and then delivered immediately to scanning sites because of the natural short 110-minute half-life of Fluorine-18.

===Applications in nuclear technology===
In the nuclear power sector, the SPECT technique can be applied to image radioisotope distributions in irradiated nuclear fuels. Due to the irradiation of nuclear fuel (e.g. uranium) with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, a wide array of gamma-emitting radionuclides are naturally produced in the fuel, such as fission products (cesium-137, barium-140 and europium-154) and activation products (chromium-51 and cobalt-58). These may be imaged using SPECT in order to verify the presence of fuel rods in a stored fuel assembly for IAEA safeguards purposes, to validate predictions of core simulation codes, or to study the behavior of the nuclear fuel in normal operation,
 or in accident scenarios.

==Reconstruction==
Reconstructed images typically have resolutions of 64×64 or 128×128 pixels, with the pixel sizes ranging from 3–6 mm. The number of projections acquired is chosen to be approximately equal to the width of the resulting images. In general, the resulting reconstructed images will be of lower resolution, have increased noise than planar images, and be susceptible to artifacts.

Scanning is time-consuming, and it is essential that there is no patient movement during the scan time. Movement can cause significant degradation of the reconstructed images, although movement compensation reconstruction techniques can help with this. A highly uneven distribution of radiopharmaceutical also has the potential to cause artifacts. A very intense area of activity (e.g., the bladder) can cause extensive streaking of the images and obscure neighboring areas of activity. This is a limitation of the filtered back projection reconstruction algorithm. Iterative reconstruction is an alternative algorithm that is growing in importance, as it is less sensitive to artifacts and can also correct for attenuation and depth dependent blurring. Furthermore, iterative algorithms can be made more efficacious using the Superiorization methodology.

Attenuation of the gamma rays within the patient can lead to significant underestimation of activity in deep tissues, compared to superficial tissues. Approximate correction is possible, based on relative position of the activity, and optimal correction is obtained with measured attenuation values. Modern SPECT equipment is available with an integrated X-ray CT scanner. As X-ray CT images are an attenuation map of the tissues, this data can be incorporated into the SPECT reconstruction to correct for attenuation. It also provides a precisely registered CT image, which can provide additional anatomical information.

Scatter of the gamma rays as well as the random nature of gamma rays can also lead to the degradation of quality of SPECT images and cause loss of resolution. Scatter correction and resolution recovery are also applied to improve resolution of SPECT images.

==Typical SPECT acquisition protocols==

==SPECT/CT==
In some cases a SPECT gamma scanner may be built to operate with a conventional CT scanner, with coregistration of images. As in PET/CT, this allows location of tumors or tissues which may be seen on SPECT scintigraphy, but are difficult to locate precisely with regard to other anatomical structures. Such scans are most useful for tissues outside the brain, where location of tissues may be far more variable. For example, SPECT/CT may be used in sestamibi parathyroid scan applications, where the technique is useful in locating ectopic parathyroid adenomas which may not be in their usual locations in the thyroid gland.

==Quality control==
The overall performance of SPECT systems can be performed by quality control tools such as the Jaszczak phantom.

<text>Montgomery Blair High School (MBHS) is a public high school in the Four Corners neighborhood of Silver Spring, Maryland, United States. It is operated by Montgomery County Public Schools. Its enrollment of some 3,200 students makes it the largest school by population in the state of Maryland.

The school is named for Montgomery Blair, a lawyer who represented Dred Scott in his Supreme Court case and later served as Postmaster General under President Abraham Lincoln. Opened in 1925 as Takoma Park–Silver Spring High School, the school changed its name in 1935 when it moved to 313 Wayne Avenue overlooking Sligo Creek in Silver Spring. In 1998, the school moved two miles (3 km) north to the Kay Tract, a long-vacant site just north of the Capital Beltway.

About 20% of the student body is part of one of two magnet programs: the Science, Math, and Computer Science Magnet; and the Communication Arts Program (CAP), which draw students from the Silver Spring area and across Montgomery County. The school is a member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology.

==History==

===Philadelphia–Chicago campus era (1925–1935)===
The school opened in 1925 as Takoma–Silver Spring High School with 86 students. The campus sat at the corner of Philadelphia Avenue and Chicago Avenue in suburban Takoma Park, Maryland.

By the end of the 1920s, the school had added a junior high school (8th and 9th grades) to its senior high school (10th through 12th grades). Growing along with the communities of Silver Spring and Takoma Park, it eventually encompassed kindergarten to 12th grade. By 1934, the school was over-capacity with 450 students, and so, in 1935, the 10th, 11th, and 12 grades moved to a new high school named Montgomery Blair Senior High School. For a time, students, teachers, and administrators commuted between the two campuses. The annual yearbook, ‘’Silverlogue’’, was established around this time.

===Wayne Avenue campus era (1935–1998)===
When Montgomery Blair High School&#x27;s Wayne Avenue campus opened in March 1935, it was the sixth high school in Montgomery County, and the first in the lower county. One of several Montgomery County schools designed during that period by Howard Wright Cutler, the facility then consisted only of the C building, overlooking Sligo Creek. In 1936, the Auxiliary Gymnasium was added, followed by the B building in 1940, and the D building in 1942. MBHS&#x27;s first football team was founded in 1944, and the War Memorial Stadium opened in 1947. In 1950, the A building was constructed, containing the Blair Library/Media Center. With the addition of the Main Gymnasium/Fieldhouse in 1954, MBHS possessed one of the finest basketball and football facilities in the county. The E building was added in 1959 as an administrative section, followed by the 1969 opening of the 1200-seat auditorium, named for long-time teacher and librarian Elizabeth Stickley. The most recent addition was the automotive shop building in 1973.

During World War II, students from the University of Maryland taught several classes, and in some cases, able senior students taught sophomore classes. The Blair Library created the &quot;Senior Corner&quot; to honor those who died in war. &quot;Life&quot; magazine featured the school&#x27;s Victory Corps close order drill team. Before to the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, Blair was an all-white school. In 1955, the school began to integrate along with the rest of Montgomery County.

With Silver Spring&#x27;s growth, Blair&#x27;s enrollment jumped from 600 students in 1946, to 1900 by 1956, peaking at 2900 in 1965 before being reduced from 1700 to 1400 after rezoning in 1982. Enrollment was around 1,800 when the Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet program brought 80 new students in the fall of 1985. The Communication Arts Program (CAP) followed in 1987, founded by Alicia Coleman, brought 75 new students. Overcrowding became an issue for Montgomery Blair High School, as portable buildings covered what was once open land and enrollment exceeded the building&#x27;s capacity of 2,000.

Blair is one of the few U.S. high schools with a .edu domain name, with its internet connection having gone live in the late 1980s.

===Four Corners campus era (1998–present)===
In 1994, construction began on a new campus on an empty tract of land north of the Wayne Avenue campus, at the intersection of University Boulevard, Colesville Road, and the Capital Beltway.

In fall 1998, Blair opened on the Four Corners campus, the largest high-school campus in the county and nearly twice as large as the old Wayne Avenue site. It was designed for 2,830 students.

Blair&#x27;s Wayne Avenue campus was converted into an elementary and middle school; currently, Sligo Creek Elementary School and Silver Spring International Middle School. The Elizabeth Stickley Auditorium was not included in the conversion plans, and has remained closed and deteriorating since 1997. Several local politicians and leaders, including former Maryland state senator Ida Ruben, current U.S. representative Jamie Raskin and former U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski, have endorsed projects to restore the auditorium to its former condition.

During the early to mid-2000s, the school population spiked to 3,400 students, with the overflow handled by up to eight portable classrooms. Enrollment decreased slightly due to the opening of other schools and the creation of the Downcounty Consortium. Two portables were removed at the beginning of the 2006–2007 school year, and all were gone by April 2010, when enrollment was 2,788. Enrollment has rebounded to about 3,200 students, making Blair the largest public school in Maryland.

2008 brought digital Promethean boards to many classrooms.

In 2011, Renay Johnson was appointed as the first woman to lead the school. She decided to retire at the end of the 2023-24 school year having completed 33 years of teaching. The school has not yet named a new principal. Adrianna Burgos, the current assistant principal, will serve as acting principal from July 1, 2024, until August 14, 2024. Kevin Yates, the principal at Damascus High School, will take over as acting principal at Blair effective August 15, 2024.

==Notable events==

In April 1992, Montgomery Blair High School was the first high school in the United States to sponsor a display of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt. More than 5,000 children, their families, teachers and friends came to see the Quilt.

The school has been a stop for politicians because of the school&#x27;s diversity, strong academic programs, and proximity to the nation&#x27;s capital. Some notable visits include:

* February 5, 1998: President Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair
* March 7, 2003: United States Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge and Secretary of Education Rod Paige
* June 1, 2016: Secretary of State John Kerry discussed ocean conservation

On June 23, 2005, President George W. Bush held a town-hall-style event at the school on short notice to promote his plan to partially privatize Social Security. Students and the general public were barred from attending. About 400 community members, students, and union members protested Bush&#x27;s proposals on the public sidewalk outside the school, rebuffing police attempts to persuade them to move to a park more than a block away.

During the 2010–2011 school year, NBA Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar spoke to a packed auditorium of students about his upcoming film and his life, then privately with the varsity and junior varsity basketball teams.

On February 26, 2018, U.S. Congressmen Jamie Raskin and Ted Deutch brought survivors of the Parkland high school shooting to meet with Blair students.

In November 2021, one student stabbed another in the staff parking lot during a school day. The victim was taken to the hospital and recovered from his wounds; the perpetrator was charged with attempted second-degree murder, first-degree assault, and reckless endangerment.

In October 2023, three school days were delayed or disrupted by phoned-in bomb threats that were discovered to be hoaxes by a 12-year-old child.

==Campus==
The school&#x27;s campus covers 42 acres between the Capital Beltway, U.S. Route 29, and Maryland Route 193 in Silver Spring&#x27;s Four Corners neighborhood. The school contains of space and was designed for 2,830 students. Eight portable classrooms were erected and then removed in the 2010s as student population grew and then receded. Four new portables were added in the 2017–2018 school year to handle another enrollment spike.

The school has baseball and softball fields to the east of the main building as well as &quot;Blazer Stadium&quot; which serves as the home of the school&#x27;s football, soccer, field hockey, and lacrosse teams.

The main building has three courtyards and a 750-seat auditorium. A greenhouse and accompanying patio is on the second floor on the west side for horticulture classes. The main hallway of the school, &quot;Blair Boulevard&quot;, displays flags from many countries, representing its diverse student body.

==Academics==

In 2024, MBHS was ranked 31st in Maryland and 1,736 nationally by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The school has an Honors Program and an Advanced Placement Program.

===Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet program===
In 1985, Montgomery County Public Schools opened its first Science, Mathematics, and Computer Science Magnet program at Blair. At the time, Blair had the highest minority population among the high schools in the county and the lowest standardized test scores. The school board conducted a survey to decide that a specialized science magnet program would attract high-achieving white and Asian students to Blair. Although there was criticism of the program from some parents and students, the leaders of the PTA and the principal supported the program, noting that by 1989 more families were staying in the neighborhood to attend Blair and fewer students were seeking to transfer out. In 1993, Superintendent of Montgomery County Public Schools Paul Vance told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I have never seen a high school&#x27;s image turn around so quickly.&quot;

The Magnet offers accelerated, interdisciplinary courses in science, mathematics, and computer science, including dozens of elective courses; in 2022, these included Quantum Physics, Complex Analysis, Thermodynamics, Discrete Mathematics, Marine Biology, 3D Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, Origins of Science, and Organic Chemistry. Qualified students who are not in the program may enroll in its electives. In their senior year, Magnet students complete research projects and may enter the Science Talent Search, in which the program has a long history of success. In 2017, Magnet students had a mean SAT score of 1531 and a mean composite ACT score of 35, both of which are higher than any high school in the nation.

The Blair Magnet is open to students from the southern and eastern areas of Montgomery County, who are selected through a competitive application and testing process. (A program at Poolesville High School provides a similar curriculum for students in the northern and western areas of Montgomery County.)

The Magnet program has been criticized for being overwhelmingly white and Asian, enrolling few black and Hispanic students. The Magnet was threatened with proposed budget cuts in 2008, but after student protests, the most severe cuts were repealed.

In 2018, a retired Magnet teacher was accused of sexual harassment by many former students.

===Communication Arts Program===
Another magnet program, the Communication Arts Program (CAP), was established at Blair in 1988. It strives to provide a comprehensive educational approach to the humanities by offering accelerated, interdisciplinary courses in English, social studies, and media for participating students. CAP is open to students in the Downcounty Consortium and admission is competitive by application including a short essay.

CAP offers courses in drama, photography, video production, history, government, English literature, writing composition, journalism and research. The number of CAP classes decreases by year, until students only complete one CAP class in 12th grade. Freshmen and sophomores are sorted into cohorts with which they will attend all of their CAP classes. The curriculum frequently builds off of existing Advanced Placement courses but uses the program&#x27;s resources to add interdisciplinary experiences, such as a simulated presidential election that occurs over the course of a week at end of 10th grade, in which some students serve as candidates and others as campaign staff and reporters. CAP students also maintain portfolios of their work throughout the four years, which must include independent and service-based projects done outside of school. In 12th grade, they must successfully defend the portfolio&#x27;s contents to a faculty committee in order to complete the program and graduate with a CAP Diploma.

===English Department===
In addition to offering standard English courses, the English Department also offers AP courses in Language and Literature, as well as studies in dramatics, journalism, and theater.

===Fine Arts Department===
The Fine Arts Department consists of two sub-departments of Music and Visual Arts. The Music Department includes instrumental music, choral music, and general music. Each year the department hosts a fine arts festival, in which students showcase their artistic talent.

====Instrumental Music Department====

<doc id="291509" wikidata="Q467692" url="?curid=291509" title="Bektashism">
<text>Bektashism (, ) is a mystic order of Sufi Islamic origin, that evolved in 13th-century Anatolia and became widespread in the Ottoman Empire. It is named after the saint Haji Bektash Veli. The Bektashian community is currently led by Baba Mondi, their eighth Bektashi Dedebaba, and is headquartered in Tirana, Albania. Collectively, adherents of Bektashism are called Bektashians or simply Bektashis.

The Bektashis were originally one of many Sufi orders within Sunni Islam. By the 16th century, the order had adopted some tenets of Twelver Shia Islam—including veneration of Ali (the son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad) and the Twelve Imams—as well as a variety of syncretic beliefs.

The Bektashis acquired political importance in the 15th century when the order dominated the Janissary Corps. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic, the country&#x27;s leader, Kemal Atatürk, banned religious institutions that were not part of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, and the community&#x27;s headquarters relocated to Albania. Salih Nijazi was the last Dedebaba in Turkey and the first in Albania. The order became involved in Albanian politics, and some of its members, including Ismail Qemali, were major leaders of the Albanian National Awakening.

Bektashis believe in the &quot;ismah&quot; of the Islamic prophets and messengers, and the Fourteen Infallibles: the Prophet Muhammad, his daughter Fatima, and the Twelve Imams. In contrast to many Twelver Shia, Bektashis respect all of the companions of Muhammad, including Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Talha and Mu&#x27;awiya; but they consider Ali to be the greatest of all of the Prophet&#x27;s companions.

In addition to the spiritual teachings of Haji Bektash Veli, the Bektashi order was later significantly influenced during its formative period by the Hurufis (in the early 15th century), the Qalandariyya stream of Sufism, figures like Ahmad Yasawi, Yunus Emre, Shah Ismail, Shaykh Haydar, Nesimi, Pir Sultan Abdal, Gül Baba, Sarı Saltık and to varying degrees more broadly the Shia belief system circulating in Anatolia during the 14th to 16th centuries. The mystical practices and rituals of the Bektashi order were systematized and structured by Balım Sultan in the 16th century.

According to a 2005 estimate made by Reshat Bardhi, there are over seven million Bektashis worldwide, though more recent studies put the figure as high as 20 million. In Albania, they make up 9% of the Muslim population and 5% of the country&#x27;s population. An additional 12.5 million Bektashis live in Turkey. Bektashis are mainly found throughout Anatolia, the Balkans and among Ottoman-era Greek Muslim communities. The term &quot;Alevi–Bektashi&quot; is a currently frequently used expression in the religious discourse of Turkey as an umbrella term for the two religious groups of Alevism and Bektashism, despite the distinct origins and separate belief systems of both.

==History==
=== Origins and establishment ===

Bektashism originated in Anatolia as the followers of the 13th-century scholar Bektash, who himself studied under Central Asian mystic Ahmad Yasawi. The doctrines and rituals of the Bektashiyya were codified by the mystic Balim Sultan, who is considered the (&#x27;the Second Elder&#x27;) by Bektashians.

It was originally founded as a Sufi movement. The branch became widespread in the Ottoman Empire, their lodges scattered throughout Anatolia as well as in the Balkans. It became the official order of the Janissary corps, the elite infantry corp of the Ottoman Army. Therefore, they also became mainly associated with Anatolian and Balkan Muslims of Eastern Orthodox convert origin, mainly Albanians and northern Greeks (although most leading Bektashian babas were of southern Albanian origin). In 1826, the Bektashian order was banned throughout the Ottoman Empire by Sultan Mahmud II for having close ties with the Janissary corps. Many Bektashian dervishes were exiled, and some were executed. Their tekkes were destroyed and their revenues were confiscated. This decision was supported by the Sunni religious elite as well as the leaders of other, more orthodox, Sufi orders. Bektashis slowly regained freedom with the coming of the Tanzimat era. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic, Kemal Atatürk shut down the lodges in 1925. Consequently, the Bektashian leadership moved to Albania and established their headquarters in the city of Tirana. Among the most famous followers of Bektashian in the 19th century Balkans were Ali Pasha and Naim Frashëri.

=== Dedebabate ===
After lodges in Turkey were shut down, the order&#x27;s headquarters moved to Albania. On 20 March 1930, Salih Nijazi was elected as the Dedebaba of the Bektashian community in Albania. Prior to Nijazi, the Dedebaba was Haxhi Fejzullah in Turkey. Njazi established the Bektashi World Headquarters in Tirana. Its construction was finished in 1941 during the Italian occupation of Albania. Nijazi promoted Bektashian Islam by introducing major ceremonies at popular tekkes. After he was murdered, Ali Riza succeeded him as the Dedebaba.

Despite the negative effect of the ban of lodges on Bektashian culture, most Bektashians in Turkey have been generally supportive of secularism to this day, since these reforms have relatively relaxed the religious intolerance that had historically been shown against them by the official Sunni establishment.

In the Balkans the Bektashian order had a considerable impact on the Islamization of many areas, primarily Albania and Bulgaria, as well as parts of Macedonia, particularly among Ottoman-era Greek Muslims from western Greek Macedonia such as the Vallahades. By the 18th century Bektashism began to gain a considerable hold over the population of southern Albania and northwestern Greece (Epirus and western Greek Macedonia). Following the ban on Sufi orders in the Republic of Turkey, the Bektashian community&#x27;s headquarters was moved from Hacıbektaş in central Anatolia, to Tirana, Albania. In Albania, the Bektashian community declared its separation from the Sunni community and they were perceived ever after as a distinct Islamic sect rather than a branch of Sunni Islam.

Bektashism continued to flourish until the Second World War. After the communists took power in 1945, several babas and dervishes were executed and a gradual constriction of Bektashian influence began. Ultimately, in 1967 all &quot;tekkes&quot; were shut down when Enver Hoxha banned all religious practice. When this ban was rescinded in 1990 the Bektashism reestablished itself, although there were few left with any real knowledge of the spiritual path. Nevertheless, many &quot;tekkes&quot; &quot;(lodges)&quot; operate today in Albania. The most recent head of the order in Albania was &quot;Hajji&quot; Reshat Bardhi &quot;Dedebaba&quot; (1935–2011) and the main &quot;tekke&quot; has been reopened in Tirana. In June 2011 &quot;Baba&quot; Edmond Brahimaj was chosen as the head of the Bektashian order by a council of Albanian babas. Today sympathy for the order is generally widespread in Albania where approximately 20% of Muslims identify themselves as having some connection to Bektashism.

There are also important Bektashian communities among the Albanian communities of North Macedonia and Kosovo, the most important being the Arabati Baba Teḱe in the city of Tetovo, which was until recently under the guidance of &quot;Baba&quot; Tahir Emini (1941–2006). Following the death of &quot;Baba&quot; Tahir Emini, the &quot;dedelik&quot; of Tirana appointed &quot;Baba&quot; Edmond Brahimaj (known as Baba Mondi), formerly head of the Turan Tekke of Korçë, to oversee the Harabati baba tekke. A splinter branch of the order has recently sprung up in the town of Kičevo which has ties to the Turkish Bektashian community under Haydar Ercan Dede rather than Tirana. A smaller Bektashian &quot;tekke&quot;, the Dikmen Baba Tekkesi, is in operation in the Turkish-speaking town of Kanatlarci, North Macedonia that also has stronger ties with Turkey&#x27;s Bektashis. In Kosovo, the relatively small Bektashian community has a &quot;tekke&quot; in the town of Gjakovë and is under the leadership of &quot;Baba&quot; Mumin Lama and it recognizes the leadership of Tirana.

In Bulgaria, the &quot;türbes&quot; of Kıdlemi Baba, Ak Yazılı Baba, Demir Baba and Otman Baba function as heterodox Islamic pilgrimage sites and before 1842 were the centers of Bektashian &quot;tekkes&quot;. Bektashis continue to be active in Turkey and their semi-clandestine organizations can be found in Istanbul, Ankara and İzmir. There are currently two rival claimants to the dedebaba in Turkey: Mustafa Eke and Haydar Ercan. A large functioning Bektashian &quot;tekke&quot; was also established in the United States in 1954 by Baba Rexheb. This &quot;tekke&quot; is found in the Detroit suburb of Taylor and the tomb (&quot;türbe&quot;) of Baba Rexheb continues to draw pilgrims of all faiths.

===Arabati Baba Teḱe controversy===
In 2002, a group of armed members of the Islamic Religious Community of Macedonia (ICM), a Sunni group that is the legally recognized organisation which claims to represent all Muslims in North Macedonia, invaded the Bektashian Order&#x27;s Arabati Baba Teḱe in an attempt to reclaim this tekke as a mosque although the facility has never functioned as such. Subsequently, the Bektashian Order of North Macedonia sued the government for failing to restore the tekke to the Bektashians, pursuant to a law passed in the early 1990s returning properties previously nationalized under the Yugoslav government. The law, however, deals with restitution to private citizens, rather than religious communities.

The ICM claim to the tekke is based upon their contention to represent all Muslims in North Macedonia; and indeed, they are one of two Muslim organizations recognized by the government, both Sunni. The Bektashian community filed for recognition as a separate religious community with the Macedonian government in 1993, but the Macedonian government has refused to recognize them.

===Proposed sovereign state===
On 21 September 2024, it was reported that Prime Minister Edi Rama of Albania was planning to create the Sovereign State of the Bektashi Order, a sovereign microstate for the Order within Albania&#x27;s capital of Tirana. Rama said the aim of the new state would be to promote religious tolerance and a moderate version of Islam.

== Beliefs ==
Bektashis believe in God and follow all the prophets. Bektashis claim the heritage of Haji Bektash Veli, who was a descendant of Ali, Husayn ibn Ali, Ali al-Sajjad and other Imams. In contrast to many Twelver Shia, Bektashis respect all companions of Muhammad, including Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Talha and Mu&#x27;awiya, though consider Ali to be the superior of all companions.

Bektashians follow the teachings of Haji Bektash, who preached about the Twelve Imams. Bektashis differ from other Muslims by also following the Fourteen Innocents, who either died in infancy or were martyred with Husayn. Abbas ibn Ali is also an important figure in Bektashism, and Bektashians visit Mount Tomorr to honor him during an annual pilgrimage to the Abbas Ali Türbe on August 20–25.

In addition to the Muslim daily five prayers, Bektashians have two specific prayers, one at dawn and one at dusk for the welfare of all humanity. Bektashism places much emphasis on the concept of Wahdat al-Wujud () that was formulated by Ibn Arabi.

Malakat is an important text of Bektashian written by Haji Bektash. Bektashis also follow the Quran and Hadith.

Bektashis follow the modern-day Bektashian Dedebabate, currently headed by Baba Mondi. Bektashis consider the dedebaba as their leader overseeing the entire branch.

Bektashism is also heavily permeated with Shiite concepts, such as the marked reverence of Ali, the Twelve Imams, and the ritual commemoration of Ashura marking the Battle of Karbala. The old Persian holiday of Nowruz is celebrated by Bektashis as Ali&#x27;s birthday (see also Nevruz in Albania).

The Bektashian Order is a Sufi order and shares much in common with other Islamic mystical movements, such as the need for an experienced spiritual guide—called a &quot;baba&quot; in Bektashian parlance — as well as the doctrine of &quot;the four gates that must be traversed&quot;: the &quot;Sharia&quot; &quot;(religious law)&quot;, &quot;Tariqah&quot; &quot;(the spiritual path)&quot;, &quot;Marifa&quot; &quot;(true knowledge)&quot;, &quot;Haqiqa&quot; &quot;(truth)&quot;.

There are many other practices and ceremonies that share similarities with other faiths, such as a ritual meal (&quot;muhabbet&quot;) and yearly confession of sins to a &quot;baba&quot; (&quot;magfirat-i zunub&quot; مغفرة الذنوب). Bektashis base their practices and rituals on their non-orthodox and mystical interpretation and understanding of the Quran and the prophetic practice (Sunnah). They have no written doctrine specific to them, thus rules and rituals may differ depending on under whose influence one has been taught. Bektashis generally revere Sufi mystics outside of their own order, such as ibn Arabi, al-Ghazali and Rumi, who are close in spirit to them despite many of being from more mainstream Islamic backgrounds.

As with other Muslims, Bektashis do not consume pork and consider it haram (&quot;prohibited&quot;) and in addition, do not consider rabbit. Rakia, a fruit brandy, is used as a sacramental element by in Bektashism, where it is not considered alcoholic and is referred to as &quot;dem&quot;.

== Poetry and literature ==

Poetry plays an important role in the transmission of Bektashian spirituality. Several important Ottoman-era poets were Bektashis, and Yunus Emre, the most acclaimed poet of the Turkish language, is generally recognized as a subscriber to the Bektashian order.

Like many Sufis, the Bektashis were quite lax in observing daily Muslim laws, and women as well as men took part in ritual wine drinking and dancing during devotional ceremonies. The Bektashis in the Balkans adapted such Christian practices as the ritual sharing of bread and the confession of sins. Bektashi mystical writings made a rich contribution to Sufi poetry.

A poem from Bektashi poet Balım Sultan (died c. 1517/1519):
==Community hierarchy==
Like most other Sufi orders, Bektashism is initiatic, and members must traverse various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual path to the Reality. The Turkish names are given below, followed by their Arabic and Albanian equivalents.
#First-level members are called &quot;aşıks&quot; عاشق (). They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it.
#Following initiation (called &quot;nasip&quot;), one becomes a &quot;mühip&quot; محب ().
#After some time as a &quot;mühip&quot;, one can take further vows and become a &quot;dervish&quot;.
#The next level above dervish is that of &quot;baba&quot;. The &quot;baba&quot; (lit. father) () is considered to be the head of a &quot;tekke&quot; and qualified to give spiritual guidance (&quot;irshad&quot; إرشاد).
#Above the &quot;baba&quot; () is the rank of &quot;halife-baba&quot; (or &quot;dede&quot;, grandfather).
#The &quot;dedebaba&quot; () is traditionally considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashian Order. Traditionally the residence of the &quot;dedebaba&quot; was the Pir Evi (The Saint&#x27;s Home) which was located in the shrine of Hajji Bektash Wali in the central Anatolian town of Hacıbektaş (aka Solucakarahüyük), known as the Hajibektash complex.

Traditionally there were twelve of these hierarchical rankings, the most senior being the &quot;dedebaba&quot; (great-grandfather).

== Administration ==

In Albania, the World Headquarters of the Bektashi () divides the country into 6 different administrative districts (similar to Christian parishes and patriarchates), each of which is called a &quot;gjyshata&quot;.

* The Gjyshata of Gjirokastra (headquarters: tekke of Asim Bab): the regions of Gjirokastra, Saranda and Tepelena.
* The Gjyshata of Korça (headquarters: tekke of Turan): the regions of Korça, Devoll, Pogradec and Kolonja, including Leskovik.
* The Gjyshata of Kruja (headquarters: tekke of Fushë Kruj): the regions of Kruja, Kurbin, Bulqiza, Dibra, Mat, Shkodra and Durrës.
* The Gjyshata of Elbasan (headquarters: tekke of Baba Xhefai): the regions of Elbasan, Gramsh, Peqin, Lushnja, Kavaja, and Librazhd, including Përrenjas.
* The Gjyshata of Vlora (headquarters: tekke of Kusum Bab): the regions of Vlora, Mallakastra, Fier, including Patos and Roskovec.
* The Gjyshata of Berat (headquarters: tekke of Prisht): the regions of Berat, Skrapar and Përmet.

During the 1930s, the six &quot;gjyshata&quot; of Albania set up by Sali Njazi were:

*Kruja, headquartered at the tekke of Fushë-Krujë
*Elbasan, headquartered at the tekke of Krastë, Dibër
*Korça, headquartered at the tekke of Melçan
*Gjirokastra, headquartered at the tekke of Asim Baba
*Prishta, representing Berat and part of Përmet
*Vlora, headquartered at the tekke of Frashër

National headquarters in other countries are located in:
* Gjakova, Kosovo
* Tetovo, North Macedonia
* Taylor, Michigan, United States

There is also a Bektashian office in Brussels, Belgium.

== World Bektashi Congress ==

The World Bektashi Congress, also called the National Congress of the Bektashi, a conference during which members of the Bektashi Community make important decisions, has been held in Albania several times. Since 1945, it has been held exclusively in Tirana. The longest gap between two congresses lasted from 1950 to 1993, when congresses could not be held during Communist rule in Albania. A list of congresses is given below.

<text>The bajrak (pronounced or , meaning &quot;banner&quot; or &quot;flag&quot;) was an Ottoman territorial unit, consisting of villages in mountainous frontier regions of the Balkans, from which military recruitment was based. It was introduced in the late 17th century and continued its use until the end of Ottoman rule in Rumelia. The bajrak included one or more clans. It was especially implemented in northern Albania and in parts of Kosovo (Sanjak of Prizren and Sanjak of Scutari), where in the 19th century these regions constituted the frontier with the Principality of Serbia and Principality of Montenegro. These sanjaks had notable communities of Gheg Albanians (Muslims and Catholics), Serbs and Slavic Muslims. The Albanians adopted the system into their clan structure, and bajraks endured during the Kingdom of Serbia (1882–1918) and People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania (1944–1992).

==Overview==
The bajrak was a territorial unit of the Ottoman Empire, consisting of a group of villages, from which military recruitment was organized – a &quot;territorialized military organization.&quot; The bajrak was composed of one or more clans. Several smaller clans could inhabit a single bajrak while larger clans occupied several bajrak; usually a &quot;bajraktar&quot; (&quot;standard-bearer&quot;) led a clan, while in some cases a bajraktar led several clans or a single clan had several bajraktars. The Ottomans entrusted the bajraktar with providing soldiers from his bajrak in exchange for privileges, and sometimes he performed important administrative and judicial duties. The bajraktar was usually hereditary position, via paternal ancestry appointed by the Ottoman government. Bajraks formed loose tribal confederations; for example, the Shala joined the Shoshi.

The bajrak system existed in many mountainous ethnographic regions, such as Lumë. 

==Aftermath==
===In Albania===
According to Enke (1955), the Dukagjin highlands was inhabited by the &quot;&quot;six bajraks&quot;, Shala, Shoshi, Kir, Gjaj, Plan, and Toplan,&quot; while according to Prothero (1973), it then included &quot;Pulati, Shala and Shoshi, Dushmani, Toplana, Nikaj, and Merturi.&quot;

===In Serbia and Yugoslavia===
In Kosovo, after the conquest by Kingdom of Serbia, the Albanians incorporated the &quot;bajrak&quot; into their clan system (known as &quot;fis&quot;). The Yugoslav authorities tried to break up the feudal relations created through this system.

<doc id="291512" wikidata="Q8014849" url="?curid=291512" title="William Bulger">
<text>William Michael Bulger (born February 2, 1934) is an American former Democratic politician, lawyer, and educator from South Boston, Massachusetts. His eighteen-year tenure as President of the Massachusetts Senate is the longest in history. After leaving office, he became president of the University of Massachusetts.

Bulger came from Old Harbor Village Housing Development (now more commonly known as the Mary Ellen McCormick Housing Development). He graduated from Boston College High School in 1952, then from Boston College in Classics, then from Boston College Law School.

Bulger was the younger brother of the convicted mob boss James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger, who led the Winter Hill Gang, and he received harsh criticism for refusing to distance himself from his brother, who was convicted of participating in 11 murders and sentenced to life in prison, or to cooperate with authorities after he became a fugitive. He was forced to resign from the presidency of the University of Massachusetts. Bulger went on to teach as a visiting scholar at Suffolk University, but has since removed himself from public life.

== Early life ==
William Bulger&#x27;s father, James Joseph Bulger Sr., was from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland. After settling in Everett, Massachusetts, James Sr. married Jane Veronica &quot;Jean&quot; McCarthy, a first-generation Irish immigrant. William Bulger was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and is the third of six children in the family, and younger brother of former mob boss James Joseph &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger Jr. (1929–2018).

Bulger&#x27;s father worked as a union laborer and occasional longshoreman; he lost his arm in an industrial accident and the family was reduced to poverty. In May 1938, when Bulger was four years old, the family moved to South Boston&#x27;s Old Harbor Village housing project, soon after it opened. He grew up there and has maintained lifelong friendships with many of those who were his former neighbors, including best friend, Korean War Marine P.O.W. and Purple Heart recipient Fred L. Toomey. The late Congressman Joe Moakley (1927–2001) was also a close childhood neighbor. Although the Bulger family was poor, William matriculated into Boston College High School. He enrolled at Boston College in 1952, but his undergraduate career was interrupted when he joined the United States Army. He served from September 1953 to November 1955, then returned to Boston College, completing his undergraduate degree in English Literature with the help of the G.I. Bill. He attended Boston College Law School, from which he received his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree in 1961. He is also the recipient of over 20 honorary degrees from a variety of academic institutions.

== Political career ==
Bulger became interested in politics in 1959 and was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1960. After serving five terms, Bulger was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in 1970 representing the First Suffolk District. In 1973, he was named Second Assistant Floor Majority Leader. After Joseph DiCarlo&#x27;s conviction for extortion in 1977, Bulger succeeded him as Senate Majority Leader. Bulger was elected President of the Massachusetts State Senate in 1978 and was re-elected every two years through 1996, making his time as State Senate president the longest tenure in Massachusetts history.

Like other Massachusetts politicians who were elected leaders of their legislative chambers, Bulger was frequently pilloried in the media, but remained very popular in his district. He won his district election every two years from 1961 to 1994 without ever facing a serious challenger other than in the Democratic primary in 1988, when Stephen Holt, a neophyte liberal activist and bookstore owner from Dorchester, won 31 out of 60 precincts, only to lose by a landslide due to the huge turnout of Bulger supporters in South Boston.

Bulger appeared in &quot;Primary Motive&quot; as &quot;Senator William Bulger&quot;.

For many years, Bulger hosted the annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Breakfast in South Boston; it is a &quot;roast&quot; of politicians.

=== Political milestones ===
Bulger was a leading opponent of the desegregation of Boston schools achieved through busing. During one protest, he called the police who were arresting protestors against desegregation &quot;the Gestapo&quot;.

During the 1960s, Bulger led efforts to write the first child abuse reporting laws in the state. He was supportive of environmental protection legislation.

Bulger was among the first advocates of charter schools and public school choice. During the 1980s, he advocated funding of public libraries, the expansion of childhood nutrition services and fuel assistance programs. As Senate president, Bulger led the debate on welfare reform in the early 1990s, with the resulting legislation becoming the model for a national law.

== President of the University of Massachusetts system ==
Bulger was appointed president of the University of Massachusetts by the board of trustees on November 28, 1995. His candidacy for the UMass position was supported by Governor William Weld. The appointment was controversial in academic circles, as Bulger had no prior experience in higher education, and lacked the academic doctoral degree usually required for the presidency of a major state university system.

On August 6, 2003, Bulger announced that he would resign as president of the system effective September 1, 2003. His resignation came due to pressure from Governor Mitt Romney after Bulger had refused to cooperate with authorities who were searching for Bulger&#x27;s brother, the notorious mobster James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger.

== Extortion investigation ==
In 1989, a close associate of Bulger, Thomas Finnerty, was accused of extorting $500,000 from a real estate developer, Harold Brown. Bulger received $240,000 of the payment. Both men maintained that it was a loan from Brown. After an investigation by U.S. Attorney Jeremiah O&#x27;Sullivan, no charges against Bulger were pressed.

== Whitey Bulger controversy ==
Bulger&#x27;s older brother James &quot;Whitey&quot; Bulger Jr., was a convicted crime boss and multiple murderer and the former boss of the Winter Hill Gang. Whitey was a fugitive from 1995 until his arrest in June 2011. William Bulger lived next door to a house owned by one of his brother&#x27;s associates, &quot;where the gang hatched plots, stored an arsenal of weapons and even committed murder.&quot;

In 1999, Whitey&#x27;s longtime aide, Kevin Weeks, pleaded guilty to a number of charges related to Whitey&#x27;s crime spree and became a cooperating witness. Weeks revealed that in 1995, William talked to Whitey during an arranged phone conversation just two weeks after Whitey fled a pending racketeering indictment. When William testified before a grand jury in 2001, a federal prosecutor pressed him without success for information on his brother: So just to be clear, you felt more loyalty to your brother than you did to the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts? I never thought about it that way, Bulger replied. But I do have an honest loyalty to my brother, and I care about him (…) It’s my hope that I&#x27;m never helpful to anyone against him (…) I don&#x27;t have an obligation to help everyone catch him. When asked why he didn&#x27;t urge Whitey to turn himself in, William replied that he didn&#x27;t feel it was in his brother&#x27;s best interest to give himself up at the time.

After invoking the Fifth Amendment when called to testify in 2002 before a Congressional committee investigating his brother&#x27;s corrupt relationship with the FBI, he testified in June 2003, after being granted immunity from prosecution for obstruction of justice. Bulger claimed that he did not know that his brother was involved in murder or with narcotics and even denied that he’d ever heard of the Winter Hill Gang. According to a book about Whitey Bulger quoted by &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Asked if he wanted Whitey to give himself up, &#x27;the normally loquacious Bulger sat for several moments, unable to speak.&quot;

At the hearing, Bulger revealed that he went to an arranged location in 1995 to take a call from his fugitive brother, apparently to avoid electronic eavesdropping. He claimed that not notifying authorities about the call was &quot;in no way inconsistent with my devotion to my own responsibilities, my public responsibilities&quot; as state senate president. Asked what he thought his brother did for a living, William Bulger said:

I had the feeling that he was in the business of gaming and ... whatever. It was vague to me but I didn&#x27;t think, for a long while he had some jobs but ultimately it was clear that he was not being, you know, he wasn&#x27;t doing what I&#x27;d like him to do.

He added that he loved his brother and hoped that the most brutal rumors concerning him would be proven false.

Bulger came under harsh criticism for evasiveness, and Governor Mitt Romney, among others, demanded his resignation as president of the University of Massachusetts. Under pressure from all quarters, Bulger resigned in the fall of 2003.

Bulger also testified that the FBI never asked if he knew of Whitey&#x27;s location. Those remarks were disputed by a former FBI agent who claimed Bulger declined to submit to an interview with the FBI. Months later, the committee report found Bulger&#x27;s testimony &quot;inconsistent&quot; about whether the FBI had contacted him in the search for his fugitive brother.

Upon Whitey&#x27;s arrest in California in June 2011, William Bulger issued a statement expressing his &quot;sympathies to the families hurt&quot; in the case, and asking for privacy for his family.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2013, after Whitey Bulger was convicted of murder, that William Bulger&#x27;s attitude toward his brother led to unfavorable comparisons with the brother of the Unabomber, who provided authorities with information leading to the apprehension of Ted Kaczynski, who subsequently was convicted in the bombings. The &quot;Times&quot; concluded that &quot;by contrast, it is hard to imagine what, if anything, would ever make Mr. Bulger turn on his brother.&quot;

== Active retirement and family ==
Bulger is a past president of the Boston Public Library and past member of the board of trustees. He is also overseer emeritus of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In addition, he is a former member of the Massachusetts General Hospital board of trustees, Museum of Fine Arts board of trustees, and McLean Hospital board of trustees. He joined the faculties of Boston College and Suffolk University as a lecturer of political science in 2004. Bulger lived in South Boston with Mary Foley (1935–2020), his wife whom he married in 1960 until her death on June 7, 2020. Bulger and his wife have nine children and 33 grandchildren. According to the Massachusetts Open Checkbook list of state pensions, Bulger&#x27;s pension from Massachusetts for his position as University of Massachusetts president ranged from $198,926 to $201,266 for the years 2011 to 2019.

<text>Richard Montgomery High School (RMHS) is a public high school located in Rockville, Maryland. It is part of the Montgomery County Public Schools system. RMHS hosts the county&#x27;s most competitive and far-reaching International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.
==History==

Richard Montgomery High School is the oldest public high school in Montgomery County. It was first established in 1892 as &quot;Rockville High School&quot;, when the state Board of Education first allocated funds to local school to educate high school students. The first class of twelve seniors graduated in 1897.

A new high school was constructed and opened for use in September 1905 on East Montgomery Avenue and Monroe Street. An addition was built in 1917, expanding the school to 19 classrooms. Rockville Colored High School was opened in 1927. The school for white students was renamed Richard Montgomery High School (after a Major General Richard Montgomery, who had been a slave holder) to distinguish between the two in 1935.

After a fire destroyed the old high school building in 1940, the building was rebuilt on the current site in 1942, measuring . Additions to the school were made in 1952 at , 1959 at , in 1964 at , 1969 at , 1975 at , 1976 at , and 1988 at . By this point, the campus had reached 26.2 acres (106,000 m²) in size.

In April 2008 stories appeared in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Montgomery County Gazette&quot;, and the &quot;Montgomery Sentinel&quot;, alleging that the school principal, Moreno Carrasco, had been running a private business on school time and was using materials that appeared to be plagiarized from a seminar that he had attended at school district expense. Carrasco went on extended sick leave.

During Carrasco&#x27;s absence, the student newspaper, &quot;The Tide&quot;, requested that administrators approve publication of an article about the investigation into Carrasco&#x27;s alleged ethics violations and business endeavors. Assistant Principal Veronica McCall denied permission for publication of the article, but was overridden by Community Superintendent Dr. Sherry Liebes after &quot;The Tide&quot; editors announced that they would go public with news of the denial. The article was finally published online on April 24, 2008.

On June 10, 2008, Montgomery County Public Schools announced that Carrasco had been named the new director of secondary leadership training. The announcement also stated that the allegations about Carrasco&#x27;s involvement in private consulting were &quot;thoroughly investigated&quot; and &quot;not substantiated&quot;.

On June 23, 2008, Nelson McLeod II was named the new principal of Richard Montgomery High School. He left the position in May 2014 due to a cardiac medical condition, and was replaced by Damon Monteleone in July 2014.

In 2020, a petition was started to rename the school due to its namesake, Richard Montgomery, being a slave owner.

===Campus===
Richard Montgomery opened a new $71 million building following the end of students&#x27; 2007 winter break. The new building features wireless internet for the teachers which has since been opened to student access, LCD projectors in every classroom, dozens of Promethean interactive whiteboards and learner response devices, a modern auditorium, and a recording and TV studio.

The school has an artificial turf stadium next to tennis courts and a track.

== Areas Served ==
Richard Montgomery serves students living in Rockville and a small portion in Potomac. It feeds from one middle school and five elementary schools:

* Julius West Middle School
** Beall Elementary School
** College Gardens Elementary School
** Ritchie Park Elementary School
** Bayard Rustin Elementary School
** Twinbrook Elementary Schol

=== Potential Future Boundary Changes ===
As of the 2023-24 school year, RMHS projects to be over-enrolled for the next 15 years with its current attendance zones. To address these concerns, along with overutilization among other nearby schools, the county is conducting a boundary study for the new Crown High School, which has an expected completion date of August 2027.

==Academics==
The school houses Montgomery County&#x27;s first International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IB). This competitive-entry magnet programme draws students from all over Montgomery County and has an IB diploma rate of 97%, the highest of its kind in the United States. The IB programme has an approximately 12.5% acceptance rate for incoming freshmen. Entry is based middle school transcripts, and a personal essay.

Incoming freshmen who have been accepted into the IB programme are first enrolled in a special two-year programme consisting of courses designed to prepare them for more rigorous IB courses they will take in their junior and senior years. This also serves as a continuation of the final two years of the Middle Years Programme (MYP). The first three years of the MYP programme are offered to all students who attend Julius West Middle School, which is the sole middle school that feeds into RM. The MYP curriculum stresses &quot;life long learning,&quot; &quot;critical thinking,&quot; and &quot;responsible global citizenship.&quot; It is a five-year programme designed for students in grades 6–10, and all Richard Montgomery students participate regardless of whether they are in the IB programme or whether they participated in middle school. Upon completion, non-IB students can apply to enroll in the IB programme. Students are accepted each year through this secondary application process for the IB programme.

In 2007, Richard Montgomery was featured in &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine as the 27th highest-rated high school in the nation. In June 2002, it won its first award in National Scholastic Championship at George Washington University. Richard Montgomery High School won the 2003 Blue Ribbon in Education Award by the United States Department of Education. RM has been identified as the number one school in the D.C. metropolitan area in the Challenge Index for Rigor. Richard Montgomery has also had multiple Marian Greenblatt Education Fund award winner teachers.

As of 2024, Richard Montgomery is the 6th-ranked high school in Maryland and the 394th-ranked nationwide, according to U.S News and World Report.

Richard Montgomery students average a score of 1236 on the SAT, averaging 621 on the verbal section and 615 on the math section.

==Activities==
Richard Montgomery has a student newspaper, &quot;The Tide&quot;, and a student literary magazine, &quot;Fine Lines&quot;. &quot;The Tide&quot; received First Place with Special Merit from the America Scholastic Press Association in 2013. &quot;Fine Lines&quot; has received various Gold Crown Awards from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association, including in 2003. 

Richard Montgomery&#x27;s quizbowl team (known as &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot;) won the National Scholastics Championship in 2002. In 2006, they won the NAQT High School National Championship Tournament in Chicago.

Richard Montgomery&#x27;s International Space Settlement Design Competition team won the 2008 cycle in Houston, Texas.

The Richard Montgomery Mock Trial team is the school&#x27;s most decorated varsity team. Under longtime coach Daniel Evans, who retired in 2024, the team won twenty-six Montgomery County championships, reached fifteen statewide Final Fours, appeared in ten state finals, and won five state championships, most recently in 2019 and 2023. The team&#x27;s margin of victory in the 2019 championship was the largest in state history.

===Music ensembles===

Ensembles such as the Madrigals, a chamber choir, and the Jazz Band often travel off campus to perform at various venues. The Philharmonic/Chamber ensemble is the highest ranking orchestra in the school. The marching band, the Marching Rockets, is also a part of football season.

<text>Menelik I (Ge&#x27;ez: ምኒልክ, &quot;Mənilək&quot;) was the legendary first Emperor of Ethiopia. According to &quot;Kebra Nagast&quot;, a 14th-century national epic, in the 10th century BC he is said to have inaugurated the Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia, so named because Menelik I was the son of the biblical King Solomon of ancient Israel and of Makeda, the Queen of Sheba.

== Life ==
According to the medieval Ethiopian book, the &quot;Kebra Nagast,&quot; written in Geʽez in 1321 CE, his name was &quot;Bäynä Ləḥkəm&quot; (from , , &quot;son of the wise&quot;). He was conceived when his father Solomon tricked his visiting mother, the Queen of Sheba, into sleeping with him. His mother raised him as Jewish in her homeland, and he only traveled to Jerusalem to meet his father for the first time when he was in his twenties. While his father begged Menelik to stay and rule over Israel, Menelik told him that he wanted to return home. Thus, Solomon sent many Israelites with him, to aid him in ruling according to biblical standards; which were aggrieved at being exiled forever. One recount is that King Solomon gave the Ark of the Covenant to his son, while another states that Menelik and his Israelite companions took the Ark with them; and Solomon attempted to regain the ark but was unable to, due to its supernatural properties aiding Menelik. Upon the death of his mother, or upon her abdication in his favor, Menelik was crowned King of Ethiopia.

According to one Ethiopian tradition, Menelik was born at Mai-Bela near the village of Addi-Shmagle, located north west of Asmara, in Eritrea.

== Dynasty ==
According to legend, Menelik I founded the Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia that ruled Ethiopia with few interruptions for close to three thousand years. This ended 225 generations later, with the deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974. Historical records show that the Solomonic dynasty was restored, based on the traditional narrative, in 1262 AD, when Yekuno Amlak, who claimed descent from biblical Solomon and Sheba, overthrew the last ruler of the Zagwe dynasty, dismissing them as not of &quot;the house of Israel&quot; (i.e., of Solomon). and re-established the Solomonic Dynasty in 1270 AD. Acts 8:26–40 depicts a 1st-century account of a eunuch of Candace, Queen of Ethiopians on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, encountering Saint Philip in Samaria.

== Popular culture ==
Much tourist art in Ethiopia depicts the narrative about Menelik I in a series of panels, 44 scenes, eleven for each of four lines. The story depicted on them is the oral version (beginning with a backstory on Sheba and including an Ethiopian maid who also becomes pregnant by Solomon), not the medieval text version.

2004 short documentary, &quot;Menelik I&quot;, was filmed in Ethiopia. It tells the story of the son of the Queen of Sheba through tableau images and music.

== Tomb ==
A site known as the tomb of Menelik I is located 2 Kilometres west of Axum. A German expedition in 1906 discovered walls and a room at the site. The clergy of Axum collected bones that were alleged to belong to Menelik I and placed them in the Axum Sion Cathedral.

== Ark of the Covenant ==
According to Ethiopian tradition, the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia by first born sons of the Israelites who accompanied Menelik on his return from Jerusalem. The Ark is believed to be held in Axum and no one is allowed to enter the shrine it is held in except for one monk who is assigned to look after it for life and is not allowed to leave the courtyard of the church. During the persecution of Gudit in the 10th century and the Ethiopian-Adal war in the 16th century the Ark was moved south to Lake Ziway and later brought back to Axum.

<doc id="291518" wikidata="Q194427" url="?curid=291518" title="The O.C.">
<text>The O.C. is an American teen drama television series created by Josh Schwartz that originally aired on Fox in the United States from August 5, 2003, to February 22, 2007, with a total of four seasons consisting of 92 episodes. The series title, &quot;O.C.&quot;, is an initialism of Orange County, the location in Southern California in which the series is set.

The series centers on Ryan Atwood, a troubled and gifted young man from a broken home who is adopted by the wealthy and philanthropic Sandy and Kirsten Cohen. Ryan and his adoptive brother Seth, a socially awkward, quick-witted teenager, deal with life as outsiders in the high-class world of Newport Beach. Ryan and Seth spend much time navigating their relationships with girl-next-door Marissa Cooper, Seth&#x27;s childhood crush Summer Roberts, and the fast-talking loner Taylor Townsend. Storylines deal with the culture clash between the idealistic Cohen family and the shallow, materialistic, and closed-minded community in which they reside. The series includes elements of postmodernism, and functions as a mixture of melodrama and comedy.

The series premiered with high ratings and was one of the most popular new dramas of the 2003–2004 television season. It was widely referred to as a pop cultural phenomenon and received mostly positive reception from critics. However, ratings declined as the show went on. The low ratings led to its cancellation in early 2007.

&quot;The O.C.&quot; has been broadcast in more than 50 countries worldwide. The series has also been released on DVD as well as on iTunes and streaming services Hulu and Max.

==Plot==
The first season focuses on Ryan Atwood&#x27;s arrival in Newport Beach to live with Sandy and Kirsten Cohen, who take him in after his mother kicks him out. A major theme of the first season is the culture shock Ryan feels as he adjusts from a life of domestic abuse and poverty to living in a superficial high-class society. He quickly befriends and bonds with Seth Cohen, and begins to have a romantic relationship with Marissa Cooper. Although coming from very different backgrounds, Ryan soon discovers that he deals with similar issues to his new peers, such as self-identity conflict and familial alienation. The relationship between Ryan and Marissa flourishes when he supports her through her parents&#x27; divorce. As the show progresses, Ryan takes a very protective role over Marissa, showing Ryan to be a much more stable, controlled person than originally portrayed. Other storylines include Seth&#x27;s development from a friendless loner to having two romantic options in Summer and Anna, as well as the arrivals of Oliver Trask, a troubled teen who befriends Marissa during their coinciding therapy sessions, and Theresa Diaz, Ryan&#x27;s close friend and former love interest from his hometown of Chino. Meanwhile, Sandy Cohen frequently comes into conflict with Caleb Nichol, Kirsten&#x27;s father and a wealthy industrialist who is said to &quot;basically own Newport.&quot;

The second season of &quot;The O.C.&quot; continues to follow the tumultuous romantic relationships between Ryan and Marissa, Seth and Summer, and Sandy and Kirsten. Josh Schwartz, the show&#x27;s creator, stated that in the second season, the show would &quot;no longer be about Ryan&#x27;s past; now it&#x27;s going to be about Ryan&#x27;s future,&quot; and that this season would &quot;slow down the storytelling a little bit ... and evolve the characters.&quot; For example, the story closely follows Ryan in his advanced physics class, where tension is created between him and another student, Lindsay, who presumes that Ryan will be useless as a lab partner, who thus prevents him from contributing to the work that must be submitted. Ryan&#x27;s character begins to grow when he stands up to Lindsay and convinces her to allow him to contribute, forcing them to work together to complete the assignment. They later become involved romantically, creating extreme complications and relational shifts amongst the now &quot;Cooper-Nichol&quot; family. The Bait Shop becomes a prominent social destination for the teenage characters. A number of recurring characters are introduced, such as D.J., Lindsay Gardner, Zach Stevens, and Alex Kelly, with whom the main characters form a variety of relationships. Ryan&#x27;s brother, Trey Atwood, gets out of jail and threatens to bring Ryan&#x27;s old life into his new one. Sandy and Kirsten also face new conflicts after drifting apart during the summer. The second season ends with Marissa shooting Trey after Ryan confronts him for attempting to sexually assault Marissa.

The third season creates many dynamic changes with regards to relationships and power within the characters&#x27; society. Firstly, Marissa is expelled from the Harbor School. The Cooper family, left with little money, is forced to move into a trailer park. Julie Cooper-Nichol, once one of the richest women in all of Newport, struggles to put food on the table for her daughters. Marissa&#x27;s life begins to spiral out of control, as she struggles with alcohol and drug abuse, as well as dealing with the loss of her close friend Johnny. Similarly, Kirsten confronts her alcohol addiction and eventually leaves rehab, only to encounter more problems when she begins business with a con artist. The other characters look towards college, with Seth and Summer competing for a spot at Brown University. Sandy&#x27;s moral compass becomes imperiled when he takes over Caleb&#x27;s old position as head of The Newport Group, pursuing a project to establish more low-income housing in Newport. Ryan also attempts to resolve his individual relationships with his mother, and with his childhood friend Theresa Diaz. He also pursues the idea of a post-secondary education, with encouragement from both Sandy and Kirsten to visit Berkeley. However, Ryan&#x27;s life is quickly put on hold when, in the season 3 finale, Ryan decides to drive Marissa to the airport, and they are run off the road by Kevin Volchok, Marissa&#x27;s most recent love affair gone wrong. In the last few minutes of the episode, Ryan pulls Marissa out from the burning car, only to watch her die in his arms.

The fourth and final season begins five months after Marissa&#x27;s death in the car accident. Ryan starts the season in isolation as a broken, grieving man, seeking revenge on Volchok. With the help of Julie, both she and Ryan are able to track Volchok down in Mexico, and turn him in to federal officials. The continued love of the Cohen family and the company of the eccentric Taylor Townsend guide him back to the light. Meanwhile, Seth and Summer face the problems of a long-distance relationship as Summer leaves to attend college. The first half of the season focuses on the characters accepting the reality of Marissa&#x27;s death. The second half focuses on the characters &quot;finding themselves&quot; while facing myriad identity crises. This final season contains multiple surprises, such as a new addition to the Cohen family, a visit to an alternate universe in which Sandy becomes mayor, and a natural disaster that leaves Newport devastated.

==Episodes==

==Cast and characters==

* Peter Gallagher as Sandy Cohen, an idealistic public defender who takes in Ryan Atwood in the pilot episode, much to the dismay of his wife, Kirsten. He is the husband of Kirsten, the father of Seth Cohen, and the legal guardian of Ryan. Although he lives in an upper-class community, his politics are left-leaning and open-minded, causing friction between himself and the community. Gallagher described the character as a &quot;leftie Jewish guy from the Bronx.&quot; Sandy deals with many conflicts throughout the series, such as trying to gain acceptance from his father-in-law while being financially supported by his wife, and raising two teenagers in a (sometimes) corrupting environment.
* Kelly Rowan as Kirsten Cohen, the former CFO of real estate company the Newport Group, Sandy&#x27;s wife, and Seth&#x27;s mother. Before she met Sandy, she dated and grew up with Jimmy Cooper, father of Marissa Cooper, with whom she remains friends. She has had trouble with alcohol, which was triggered by the failing deteriorating relationship between her and her father. Kirsten goes on to open a dating service with Julie, and become a mother of two at the end of the fourth season. The character&#x27;s politics and lifestyle are conservative, a contrast to her husband. Rowan described the character as seemingly more &quot;together&quot; than herself during an interview.
* Ben McKenzie as Ryan Atwood, a troubled teenager from Chino who is brought into the privileged community of Newport Beach, California, after his mother, Dawn Atwood, throws him out of their family home. Ryan is subsequently taken in by his public defender, Sandy Cohen. He forms fast bonds with the entire Cohen family, especially Sandy&#x27;s son Seth, in addition to the girl next door, Marissa Cooper. Ryan slowly finds his place within the new, materialistic society, and makes of the most of his situation by not only completing high school, but also continuing on to university. Casting director Patrick Rush found the role of Ryan particularly hard to cast and only invited McKenzie to an audition after Fox had made them aware of the young actor after his unsuccessful audition for a UPN sitcom. Rush said, &quot;When Benjamin [McKenzie] came in, he wasn&#x27;t physically what Josh had envisioned, but he inhabited the character unlike anyone we had seen. I think that the character of Ryan is a kid that always seems a little lost and has a sense of mystery and danger; Benjamin has all those qualities.&quot; Chad Michael Murray was originally offered the role of Ryan, but turned it down for the lead role of Lucas Scott on &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;.
* Mischa Barton as Marissa Cooper (seasons 1–3), Summer&#x27;s best friend and Ryan&#x27;s on-and-off love interest. Marissa is portrayed as a &quot;spoiled girl who adjusts to being poor.&quot; Throughout the series, Marissa battles addictions to drugs and alcohol, including nearly killing herself on a trip to Mexico with her friends. Marissa&#x27;s relationships with her parents, boyfriends, and classmates are often tumultuous. The casting director referred to Marissa as &quot;a girl stuck in the trappings of her life who seemed older than her actual age.&quot; Barton left the series at the end of season three when her character was killed in a car accident. Commenting on her departure, Barton said, &quot;My character has been through so, so much and there&#x27;s really nothing more left for her to do.&quot;
* Adam Brody as Seth Cohen, the awkward adolescent son of Sandy and Kirsten Cohen. He is known for his quick quips, comic book fascination, and pop-culture references. Seth is also the love interest of Summer Roberts, on whom he had a crush since the third grade. Seth has been called a &quot;Jewish nerd into obscure emo bands&quot;, who &quot;starts dating a gorgeous, popular virgin.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized Seth as &quot;eccentric and literate, Seth professes actual wanderlust [...] The show&#x27;s press materials maintain that he&#x27;s an existential hero along the lines of Holden Caulfield.&quot; Brody&#x27;s portrayal of Seth was well received and is considered one of the overall highlights of the series.
* Chris Carmack as Luke Ward (season 1; special guest star season 2), Marissa&#x27;s first boyfriend and regular cast member for most of the first season. Luke is initially the main antagonist of the series, coining the series&#x27; famous &quot;Welcome to the O.C., bitch!&quot; line during a fight with Ryan in the premiere episode. However, he later becomes the main &quot;comic punching bag&quot; for the other characters. Schwartz characterized the later Luke as &quot;strumming a guitar being a goofball.&quot; Luke leaves Newport Beach to live with his father in Portland at the end of the first season.
* Tate Donovan as Jimmy Cooper (seasons 1–2; recurring season 3; special guest star season 4), Marissa and Kaitlin&#x27;s father (and Julie&#x27;s ex-husband). He gets in trouble for embezzlement and must face the consequences of his actions and its effect on his reputation and personal life. After his divorce from Julie, he pursues Hayley Nichol, Kirsten&#x27;s younger sister, who eventually leaves him to further her fashion career in Japan. Jimmy&#x27;s character made a brief appearance during season 3, but Jimmy was forced to leave town the morning of his wedding to Julie due to money problems. One interviewer characterized Jimmy as a &quot;lovable deadbeat dad.&quot; Josh Schwartz has referred to the character as a &quot;cat&quot; in DVD commentaries. The character is portrayed as flighty and perpetually in financial debt despite warm relationships with his daughters. The character was ranked eighth on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Worst Dads&quot;.
* Melinda Clarke as Julie Cooper, the mother of Kaitlin Cooper and Marissa Cooper. At the beginning of the show she is married to financial planner Jimmy Cooper. She is often characterized as being devious, selfish, and shallow. However, she reveals a more vulnerable and empathetic part of herself a number of times during the series. Clarke summarized her character as being &quot;clearly just such a money-digging whore. To me, it&#x27;s so funny now to see &quot;The Real Housewives of Orange County&quot; because you realize it exists and that&#x27;s what Julie was. Julie was obviously the original housewife.&quot; Clarke went on to commend the character&#x27;s &quot;incredible arc&quot;, saying that Julie started as &quot;this woman who was so superficial but, of course, she&#x27;s not just one-dimensional, she&#x27;s multi-dimensional. Starting in her pink Juicy sweat suit outfit and then by the end she&#x27;s graduated from college and moving on with her life. She&#x27;s a survivor.&quot;
* Rachel Bilson as Summer Roberts, a pretty and popular socialite who is the love interest of Seth and best friend to Marissa. Bilson&#x27;s character was originally supposed to appear in only a few episodes, but quickly became popular amongst viewers, and ended up being part of the main cast for the rest of the series. When Summer&#x27;s parents divorced, her mother abandoned the family and she has had no contact with her since. Her stepmother, nicknamed the &quot;step-monster&quot;, is a lazy woman with a suggested drug problem. Summer has been referred to as a &quot;seemingly snotty, superficial rich girl who is revealed to have hidden depth when she warms to the charms of nerdy Seth.&quot; She is the daughter of Dr. Neil Roberts. Summer later surprises audiences by turning out to be much more intellectually capable than imagined. She ends up being accepted to Brown, beating out many applicants from Harbour School, including, to his dismay, Seth. Not only intelligent, Summer proves to be an activist for animals while protesting against lab testing on animals and setting lab bunnies free. She later takes one as her own and names her Pancakes.
* Alan Dale as Caleb Nichol (season 2; recurring season 1), Kirsten&#x27;s businessman father and later Julie Cooper&#x27;s husband. His character recurs throughout the first season, and he becomes a regular during the second season, but comes to a sudden stop when his character suffers from a fatal heart attack during the second-season finale. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; characterized Caleb as a &quot;gruff, uncompromising Newport Beach, California, real-estate developer&quot;. When asked by the &quot;Tribune&quot; about the character, Dale said, &quot;The thing that&#x27;s lovely about this character is that there&#x27;s so much to do with him. His relationships are so complicated, and once the marriage happened, everyone was related in the show. That means he&#x27;s got all these people to relate to, and he relates so badly with everyone.&quot;
* Autumn Reeser as Taylor Townsend (season 4; recurring season 3), introduced in the third season as a neurotic perfectionist student. Many critics initially saw similarities between her and the character Tracy Flick from the 1999 film &quot;Election&quot;. Taylor begins the series as a villain before eventually becoming the second female lead in the fourth season. Reeser&#x27;s performance was critically acclaimed. She reflected back on the character during a 2010 interview, saying, &quot;I feel like there&#x27;s a lot of girls out there who could really relate to her, who hadn&#x27;t seen themselves on TV in that way. I loved that about her. I loved that she made no apologies for who she was even though she wasn&#x27;t what all the magazines said was OK. She was like, &quot;I&#x27;m still valid. And I&#x27;m awesome. And I know I&#x27;m odd, and that&#x27;s OK.&quot;
* Willa Holland as Kaitlin Cooper (season 4; recurring seasons 1 and 3). The role was originally played by Shailene Woodley in a recurring role during the first season. Kaitlin spends much of the series at boarding school before returning on a recurring basis in the third season (now played by Holland) and finally becoming a regular character in the fourth season. The daughter of Jimmy and Julie and sister to Marissa, her personality is more similar to her mother&#x27;s rather than her father&#x27;s, and she is portrayed as a regular pot smoker and occasional dealer. Holland observed that &quot;no one can control her&quot; but that her arc in the fourth season finds the character maturing. When asked about any disappointment over the recast, Woodley responded, &quot;I was 11 and I was on as a guest, recurring character, or whatever. My character went to boarding school and when they decided to bring her back, they actually re-auditioned me to bring her back. But I didn&#x27;t go through puberty until late [...] So, there was no weirdness when Willa Holland got it because she was so obviously right for the role... and I was so obviously not [laughs].&quot;

==Production==

===Conception ===
In 2002, creator Josh Schwartz met with Joseph &quot;McG&quot; McGinty Nichol and Stephanie Savage of production company Wonderland Sound and Vision. They told Schwartz they wanted to create a television show based in McG&#x27;s hometown of Newport Beach, Orange County, California. Savage suggested producing a police or extreme sports &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;-style show, but Schwartz knew little about the genre. Having had experiences with people from Newport Beach during his time at the University of Southern California, Schwartz came back to them with his own characters.

Schwartz pitched to studios a show portraying a romance between Lucy Muñoz—whose father worked on the wealthy Atwood family&#x27;s Newport estate—and Ryan Atwood. Warner Bros. Television was interested, but because of other shows that year based on a white man-Latina woman Romeo and Juliet–like romance, asked for changes. Schwartz and Savage modified the pitch to what they later described as &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; set in an Orange County gated community. The show was pitched to Fox in August 2002. The network targeted a summer launch for the show, and Doug Liman was brought in to direct the premiere after McG withdrew due to his scheduling conflicts with &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot;. The show was confirmed for the 2003–2004 schedule in May, and an August 5, 2003, broadcast date was selected in June.

Schwartz later said that &quot;The O.C.&quot; was like a trojan horse: &quot;The horse is a glossy nighttime soap in the tradition of &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;, with bikinis and bonfires and fistfights at galas. The soldiers inside were our characters.&quot; He said that inspiration for them came from Larry Sanders, Cameron Crowe, and other &quot;quirky character-driven shows like &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;, &quot;Undeclared&quot;, and &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;&quot;. At USC, Schwartz attended the School of Cinema-Television, and later said that &quot;The O.C.&quot; was &quot;very much based on sort of the experiences I had when I was in college&quot; as a &quot;Jewish kid from the East Coast ... surrounded by all these kids from Newport Beach who were water-polo players, and these very blonde girls who only wanted to date them. I felt very much like an outsider.&quot; Although Orange County residents criticized the show&#x27;s title, stating that people did not call the county by the phrase, Schwartz stated that USC students did say that they were from &quot;The O.C.&quot; He also stated that Cohen family in season one resembles his own family life, adding that &quot;The dynamic between Sandy and Seth is very much based on me and my dad.&quot; Schwartz reasoned that, &quot;As much as our audience enjoys living vicariously in this wealthy world, I think the true wish fulfillment comes from wishing that they had a family like the Cohens — where the parents could be that cool and that grounded and that loving, but also real parents.&quot;

Schwartz said that he wrote the highly regarded pilot episode in his boxer shorts. &quot;I had no idea what would come of it and there was just that purity to it.&quot; The script for the pilot attracted most of the regular cast to the project, including film star Peter Gallagher, who said of the pilot:
===Filming locations===

Although the show is set in Newport Beach, financial penalties imposed for filming outside the studio zone meant much of the show was filmed in the Manhattan Beach, Los Angeles County region. Many of the beach scenes were also filmed in Hermosa Beach, Redondo Beach and Torrance. Sites in Los Angeles County were used for many different on-screen locations, which include Ryan&#x27;s hometown of Chino, Luke&#x27;s father&#x27;s Portland home, Johnny&#x27;s father&#x27;s Indio office and Tijuana.

For the first episode, &quot;Premiere&quot;, the Cohen family home was shot on location in Malibu. A mock pool house was built for use in the pilot, and taken down after filming completed. The Cohens&#x27; home was recreated on a soundstage at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach for filming during the rest of the series; the pool was only 4-feet deep meaning that the cast had to act on their knees. External shots of the original house remained in use throughout the show. The pilot was shot on 35 mm film stock, while subsequent episodes used digitally post-processed 16 mm in order to reduce the cost of production.

The Harbor School is the local school that the show&#x27;s adolescents attend. Based on Newport&#x27;s Corona del Mar High School, which executive producer McG attended, the filming location was Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College, a private woman&#x27;s college in Brentwood, Los Angeles. The University of California, Los Angeles was the location used to represent Berkeley, and the University of Southern California was used to represent Brown University. The FAA First Federal Credit Union building in Hawthorne was used to depict the Newport Group in season two. Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes was used three times on the show—twice for a wedding and once for a funeral. The Cohens&#x27; original home in Berkeley, which they return to in &quot;The End&#x27;s Not Near, It&#x27;s Here&quot;, was shot in South Pasadena.

The restaurant dubbed the &quot;Crab Shack&quot; on the show is actually local landmark The Crab Cooker. Julie refers to the restaurant in a third-season episode by its real-life name. Scenes from the show were also shot at the landmark Wattles Mansion located in Hollywood.

=== The Cohen home ===
The Cohen household is a fictitious &quot;McMansion&quot; built by Caleb Nichol and The Newport Group. The house is based on two homes located in Malibu, California. The exterior shots of the front of the home and the driveway were filmed from a home on Ocean Breeze Drive in Malibu, California, built in 2002. This was filmed multiple times and used continuously for all four seasons. The interior, backyard, and infinity pool were filmed for the pilot episode in another home down the street also in Malibu. The pool house was built for the pilot episode. The interior, backyard, and pool house were rebuilt at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach after the show was picked up to save on production costs.

=== Music ===
Alexandra Patsavas, who had previously worked on shows including &quot;Roswell&quot; and &quot;Carnivàle&quot;, was appointed as music supervisor on &quot;The O.C.&quot;. Patsavas worked alongside creator Josh Schwartz, in selecting the music to be used. Schwartz said that he had &quot;always intended that music be a character on the show&quot; &quot;The O.C.&quot; made indie rock a &quot;main focus of the series&quot; and also its marketing plan, releasing six soundtracks throughout the series. In the second season, a fictional new night club and concert venue, called The Bait Shop, was introduced. Bands including the Walkmen, the Killers, Modest Mouse, the Thrills, Rachael Yamagata, Death Cab for Cutie and the Subways all made guest appearances on the show performing at the venue. In addition to having guest artists perform on the show, it also premiered many new music singles from artists including the Beastie Boys, U2, Beck, Coldplay, Gwen Stefani, and the Shins.

Many bands gained exposure through the show, which caused an increase in sales of their music. Rooney, who were the first band to guest appear on the show, experienced a &quot;200 percent increase in sales&quot; after their appearance. Even artists who just had their songs featured benefited: Imogen Heap became &quot;a household name stateside,&quot; and Youth Group, who recorded a song specifically for the show, had &quot;more than 5,000 iTunes downloads [of that track] in its first week&quot; following it being played. However, not all bands were keen to feature on the show. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah were asked to perform, but they turned it down because they were worried that it could diminish their credibility. Some fans and critics echoed that sentiment by stating that such appearances and mass marketing techniques are creating sell-outs.

Generally the music was well received. Ben Spier from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the show as a &quot;mixtaper&#x27;s dream&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that the soundtrack was the reason people kept watching the show. However, Karyn L. Barr from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated that using acts like U2 on a show that dedicated time to indie bands was &quot;selling out.&quot; Noah Davis of PopMatters.com criticized the show for neglecting plotlines and replacing them with &quot;the gang&#x27;s countless trips to the Bait Shop.&quot;

==Themes==
The series touches on themes such as inter-generational conflict, social class, social mobility, social alienation, sexual performance anxiety, hope, loneliness, virginity, emotional insecurity, environmentalism, alcoholism, drug addiction, gambling addiction, mental illness, homophobia, bisexuality, May–December romances, teen pregnancy, political activism, and eventually death and the acceptance of loss. These topics are examined through both lighthearted comedy and heightened operatic drama.

===Chrismukkah===

Within the series, Seth Cohen has a Jewish father and a Protestant (Presbyterian) mother. As a way to merge the two religions, Seth claims to have &quot;created Chrismukkah&quot; when he was six years old. The series included annual Chrismukkah episodes for every season of its run. Particulars of when exactly the holiday was celebrated were not given; Seth simply said in the first season&#x27;s Chrismukkah episode that it was &quot;eight days of presents, followed by one day of &quot;many&quot; presents.&quot; Chrismukkah later received mention in the television series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

In December 2011 the pop-culture website &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewed all four Chrismukkah episodes for its &quot;TV Club Advent Calendar.&quot; The writer noted, &quot;When thinking back on holiday specials of yore for this project, the first thing that popped into my head wasn&#x27;t nostalgia for my Rankin/Bass- and Chuck Jones-filled youth. Instead, I immediately focused on a much more recent obsession: Chrismukkah. Created by &quot;The O.C.&quot;″s Seth Cohen ...&quot; The reviewer continued, saying that &quot;A thread of underlying sadness unites all four Chrismukkah episodes, but it&#x27;s a sadness that begs to be redeemed by the end of the hour. Chrismukkah is really about traditional Christmas togetherness and your standard happy ending; it&#x27;s the everyday miracle of people coming together to create something magical.&quot; Entertainment Weekly also ranked the episodes. The show helped popularise the term as an actual holiday in mainstream media.

===Meta-fictional humor===
Several episodes feature a fictional show-within-the-show called &quot;The Valley&quot;, an in-show equivalent to &quot;The O.C.&quot; &quot;The Valley&quot;, like &quot;The O.C.&quot;, has a fictional reality TV counterpart, &quot;Sherman Oaks: The Real Valley&quot;, which causes Seth to ask, &quot;Why watch the plight of fictional characters when you can watch real people in contrived situations?&quot; The second season also focuses on the creation of a fictional comic book called &quot;Atomic County&quot;, written by Seth Cohen, that is used for similar self-deprecating purposes.

&quot;The Valley&quot; and &quot;Atomic County&quot; are used throughout the series to comment on aspects of the show itself, such as message board criticism of the show&#x27;s reliance on love triangles, the trope of mid-twenties actors portraying teenagers, and the inability of the series to be renewed for another season. In addition, several of the characters talk as if they are aware that they are in a television series. One episode in the second season finds Seth commenting that &quot;we tried some new things,&quot; but that &quot;last year was just better,&quot; echoing response from fans that the second season was inferior to the first.

&quot;USA Today&quot; remarked that &quot;The O.C.&quot;″s &quot;undertone of sarcasm and self-parody&#x27; was one of the aspects of the series that made it compelling. Writer Ken Barnes opined that &quot;The O.C.&quot; took &quot;meta-TV&quot; to its &quot;sublime peak&quot; with &quot;The Valley&quot;. He continued, saying that the &quot;device allowed producers and writers to have fun mocking critical and public perceptions of &quot;The OC&quot;, its supposed soap-operatic excesses and pop-culture obsessions. In a book written by Alan Sepinwall that examined the series, Sepinwall noted that &quot;Schwartz spends enough of his day trolling message boards to know exactly what fans are complaining about and which references to other shows and movies they&#x27;ve caught, and he incorporates it into his scripts.&quot;

An entire chapter of the book is devoted to perceived self-mockery within the series, with much attention given to the episode &quot;The L.A.&quot; from Season One. Producer Allan Heinberg said that many instances of meta-commentary had to be cut if the network or Schwartz felt they had gone too far, saying that &quot;Sandy at one point had a speech about the Golden Globes that we felt was maybe a little inside.&quot; Schwartz similarly declined a request to have &quot;The O.C.&quot; actors portray themselves on &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, another FOX show set in Orange County.

==Broadcast and distribution==

===First run broadcast===
The first season premiered at 9:00 p.m. (EDT) on August 5, 2003, on Fox, and was simulcast in Canada on CTV. The original, English-language version of the show also aired in other continents. In the United Kingdom, the first episode was aired at 9:00 p.m. (GMT) on March 7, 2004, on Channel 4, but subsequent episodes were first shown on sister station E4, a week in advance of being shown on Channel 4. In Australia, the pilot was first broadcast on the Nine Network but the channel later dropped the show. Network Ten picked up the show and by the fourth season was airing episodes within days of it being broadcast in the U.S. In New Zealand, the show was aired on TV2, and in Ireland it was broadcast on TG4. In South Africa it premiered on April 1, 2004, on satellite television channel Go and was shown on terrestrial channel SABC 3 in December 2006. In India, the English-language channel Zee Café debuted the show on December 30, 2005. For the fourth season, in the week before an episode was broadcast on television, it was available via on demand streaming through Fox Interactive Media&#x27;s MySpace and MyFoxLocal stations.

It was also aired in non-English speaking countries. It aired across Latin America on the Warner Channel, in Brazil the show premiered on November 3, 2003 and the last episode was aired on April 12, 2007. It was also broadcast on the SBT television network under the name &quot;O.C. – Um Estranho no Paraíso&quot; was broadcast between 2004 and 2009. In addition to being broadcast by the versions of the Brazilian terrestrial television channels Glitz (2012-2013), VH1 (2012) and MTV (2013-2014). In France, it aired on France 2 under the name &quot;Newport Beach&quot;. It aired in Germany on ProSieben, in Switzerland on SF zwei, and in Russia under the name &quot;OC – Lonely Hearts&quot; on STS. In Italy it was shown on Italia 1, with pay-per view channel Joi being the first to make available episodes of the third season onwards through the digital terrestrial television service Mediaset Premium. In Poland the series was broadcast under the local title &quot;Życie Na Fali&quot; on TVN in 2006 and 2007 in a daytime block from Monday to Friday at 2:00 p.m. with single episodes attracting up to a million viewers. Then, it was also repeated on TVN7.

===Cancellation===
Due to low ratings, it was rumored that the show would not return for a fifth season. In June 2006, Fox confirmed that &quot;the current order for &quot;The O.C.&quot; is 16 episodes&quot;, but added that there was a chance to add more installments. In September 2006, Rachel Bilson said that she felt like &quot;the show is over&quot;, and co-star Kelly Rowan stated that many of the cast realized the show was close to being cancelled. Rowan said that &quot;when [the fourth season] was picked up for just 16 episodes this year the cast had a feeling the end was near.&quot;

On January 3, 2007, Fox announced that &quot;The O.C.&quot; was to be cancelled. In a statement, Schwartz said &quot;This feels like the best time to bring the show to its close&quot; adding that &quot;what better time to go out than creatively on top.&quot; Fox launched an official campaign on their website called &quot;Save The O.C.&quot;, which garnered over 740,000 signatures. There were rumors that the show would be saved by the CW. The CW president Dawn Ostroff confirmed in January 2007 that while the move was discussed, it was decided against.

The main reason for the cancellation was the decline in ratings. Many media outlets have reported that the main factor behind this drop was the death of the lead character, Marissa Cooper. As one of the show&#x27;s central figures, her departure alienated many fans. Her tragic death in a car accident was seen as the beginning of the end for this teen drama.

===Syndication===

The O.C. was syndicated on Soapnet from 2007 until 2012 in the United States, and the series began airing on Pop in 2016. The show became available for streaming on CW Seed in 2015, and Hulu in 2016. In 2020, it was taken off of Hulu for rival streaming service Max.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

Season one of &quot;The O.C.&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and is frequently regarded as the best season. Upon the show&#x27;s premiere, Gael Fashingbauer Cooper of MSNBC described Ryan and Seth&#x27;s friendship as &quot;the most promising plot&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;Mr. Schwartz pulled it off, sneaking a truly smart show past the gatekeepers in the guise of something commercial and trashy and fun.&quot; The reviewer also praised how the show &quot;steered clear of both Aaron Spelling-style camp and the soggy earnestness that often characterises teen drama&quot; and praised the integration of the adult cast into the plotlines. IGN called it &quot;far more engaging and interesting&quot; than its predecessors in the teen genre. The reviewer pointed to the show&#x27;s sense of humor and respect for its audience, praising the series as &quot;very funny&quot; and &quot;well-acted&quot;, while referring to Mischa Barton as the weak link. &quot;Time Magazine&quot; critic James Poniewozik was fond of the premiere episode, saying that the show &quot;looks to have enough heart, talent and wit to generate a few seasons&#x27; worth of luxurious suds. As Ryan would say, in the teen-soap business, being 100% original doesn&#x27;t make you smart. Delivering a formula with so much style and believability that it feels new again—that does.&quot;

Despite much positive reception, the first season was not without some criticism. &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; criticized the plot and the casting, saying that &quot;the storylines usually involve the obligatory three-episode-arc drug problems or lost virginity with dialogue designed to keep a dog up to speed,&quot; and that &quot;Whoever at FOX thought Benjamin McKenzie could pass for anything younger than 25 should be fired.&quot;

The second season was widely regarded as inferior to the first, but still received generally positive reception. IGN noted that the second season contains some of the best moments of the series, and praised the bisexual romance between Alex and Marissa. It was said to have &quot;managed to surpass its ratings ploy outer trappings to actually work as one of the better Marissa plotlines, at least initially, by doing a solid job of portraying her &quot;I&#x27;ve never done this before...&quot; confusion and excitement.&quot; Another review praised episodes &quot;The Chrismukkah That Almost Wasn&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;The Rainy Day Woman&quot; as standout quality hours of the series, and praised the storyline that focused on Sandy and Kirsten&#x27;s marriage.

In contrast to the first two, Season 3 of the series was met with mostly negative reception. After the eventual cancellation of the show, Schwartz admitted that &quot;the whole first half of the third season was a total mess.&quot; IGN faulted a season which, in their opinion, had &quot;far too much time and too many episodes spent with the less than beloved character Johnny.&quot; IGN also noted that &quot;Kirsten and Sandy both suffered from unsatisfying stories,&quot; and that the departure of character Caleb Nichol had been a mistake &quot;as he had been a great character to bounce off both of the elder Cohens.&quot; In September 2007, Schwartz admitted in an interview for &quot;New York&quot; that the show &quot;went down the wrong road&quot; with Johnny. In 2023 he said &quot;We lost our sense of irony, our sense of fun. We became the type of melodrama we would have made fun of in Season 1.&quot; The season did, however, receive some praise. The new character Taylor Townsend was stated as being &quot;played to perfection by Autumn Reeser&quot; and her character was described as &quot;one of the greatest elements of &quot;The O.C.&quot;&quot; Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk described the storylines as &quot;very intelligent and also incorporate a great deal of humor to keep your interest.&quot; While looking back on the series in an interview for the complete series box-set, Schwartz explained that &quot;somewhere around Season 3, for reasons too numerous to discuss, I lost focus. The network wasn&#x27;t really supporting the show.&quot; Schwartz went on to say that the third season was probably &quot;the most important season, because it&#x27;s where I learned the most. About television, about myself as a writer, about discipline and trying to hold onto your focus even if you&#x27;re hearing a lot of opinions or being forced to add things creatively that you don&#x27;t agree with. And I don&#x27;t think Season 4 would have been as fun or as adventurous or as weird and zany and ultimately emotional if it weren&#x27;t for that experience.&quot;

The final season is generally regarded by fans and critics as a return to form for the series. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Josef Adalian said that &quot;[the show] is once again in great creative shape.&quot; He added that &quot;the scripts are snappy, the plots make sense, the acting&#x27;s solid, [and] the music is appropriately indie&quot; but criticized Fox for &quot;throwing away&quot; the show by giving it the Thursday 9:00 p.m. timeslot. Buddytv.com praised the season premiere, saying &quot;this episode is the best OC episode since the show&#x27;s first season. The absence of Mischa Barton character of Marissa Cooper is the best thing that&#x27;s happened to The OC in a long time. The cast is now exceptional from top to bottom and the show is, at least in the first episode, much darker in tone than the first three seasons. This is a good sign.&quot; Later in the season, Buddytv.com lamented that &quot;The OC is winding down, in all likelihood, and it&#x27;s a shame. The show is hitting its creative stride just now, in its fourth season, and no one cares.&quot; Critic Alan Sepinwall said of the premiere, &quot;Damn. That was... not bad. No, better than that. That was good. Confident, in character, funny on occasion (any scene with Che), genuinely touching at others (the comic book store intervention), really the most like itself the show has felt in a long time, maybe even going back to season one.&quot; In a review of a later episode, Sepinwall related that the fourth season was a &quot;resurgent season&quot; and that &quot;every &quot;O.C.&quot; episode review just turns into a list of things I liked.&quot;

Belinda Acosta of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; agreed, praising the show&#x27;s &quot;new energy&quot; and its ability to successfully cover &quot;the transition between high school and college that other series have stumbled over.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Ken Tucker commented that the fourth season was &quot;a succession of terrific subplots&quot; and praised new main cast member Taylor &quot;as a fine, funny love interest for Ryan.&quot; Greg Elwell of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; described Bullit as &quot;the breakout character of the season&quot; but commented that the season&#x27;s &quot;dark opening (...) didn&#x27;t do much to keep viewers around.&quot; IGN&#x27;s Eric Goldman was also critical, saying that &quot;as amusing as Che was, his inclusion into some later episodes gets a bit tired.&quot; Goldman also commented that &quot;the second half of Season 4 wasn&#x27;t quite as solid as the first [half]&quot;; however, he added that while the fourth season had to prove itself again as an enjoyable watch &quot;Josh Schwartz rose to this challenge (...) once again creating a show that was witty and self-aware.&quot;

=== U.S. television ratings ===

The pilot episode attracted 7.46 million viewers in the United States, came second in its time slot behind the season finale of &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot;, and was the highest rated show of the night in the 12–17-year-old demographic. The most watched &quot;O.C.&quot; episode was &quot;The Rivals&quot;, the seventeenth episode of season one. It attracted 12.72 million viewers, and was the lead-out to &quot;American Idol&quot;, which attracted 29.43 million viewers that week. &quot;The O.C.&quot; was the highest-rated new drama of the 2003–2004 season among adults aged 18 to 34, averaging a total of 9.7 million viewers.

For the second season, the show moved to an &quot;ultra-competitive Thursday&quot; timeslot against the likes of &quot;Survivor&quot;, &quot;Joey&quot; and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. This is often cited as a cause of &quot;The O.C.&quot;″s decline in popularity. The move improved Fox&#x27;s performance at the new time slot, but lost the show viewers, as average viewing figures decreased thirty percent from the previous season to 7million.

For the third season, average viewing figures decreased a further twenty percent from the previous season to 5.6 million. The Thursday 9.00 pm timeslot placed the show against two other popular shows, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

The fourth season premiered in November 2006 with very little promotion or advertisements from FOX, and was once again in the Thursday timeslot. The premiere episode attracted 3.4 million viewers, which was a series low. For the series finale, 6.7 million viewers tuned in. This was 76 percent more than the season average of 4.6 million viewers.

===Awards and honors===
For the debut episode, &quot;Premiere&quot;, Schwartz received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for Best Screenplay in an Episodic Drama, and casting directors Rush and Silverberg nominated in the Dramatic Pilot category of the Artios Awards. Luke&#x27;s declaration in the premiere episode of &quot;Welcome to the O.C., bitch&quot; was placed 83rd by TV Land in its &quot;100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases&quot; in 2006. The first season picked up four Teen Choice Awards, and was nominated for another two. Additionally it was nominated for the Outstanding New Program TCA Award, and in Australia it won a Logie Award for Most Popular Overseas Program in 2005. For the second season the show was nominated for five Teen Choice Awards, and won four of them, including best drama. It was nominated for the Favorite Television Drama People&#x27;s Choice Award, and Kelly Rowan won a PRISM Award for Performance in a Drama Series Episode, with Peter Gallagher getting a nomination. The second-season finale was nominated for a PRISM TV Drama Series Episode award. The third season was nominated for five Teen Choice Awards and won four of them, including &quot;Choice Drama/Action Adventure Show&quot; and &quot;Choice Actor: Drama/Action Adventure,&quot; which Adam Brody won for the third consecutive year.

===Legacy===
Schwartz said in 2023 that Marissa died in the third season because many online fans by then disliked her storyline, and the network wanted to kill a main character to increase ratings:

&quot;The O.C.&quot; popularized its setting, Orange County, and led to copycats like MTV&#x27;s reality show &quot;Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County&quot; and the Bravo documentary series &quot;The Real Housewives of Orange County&quot;, and its success as a prime-time soap opera helped Marc Cherry get &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; on the air. The show generated a dedicated and thriving international fan community. DVD Verdict said, &quot;&quot;The O.C.&quot; has become one of those rare shows whose influence has begun to extend far beyond the television screen, and has actually started to take an active role in shaping American teenage pop culture.&quot; Fans of the show, sometimes dubbed &quot;OC Groupies&quot;, have been active in developing a large number of fan websites and forums dedicated to the program. Famous fans of the show include the Bush twins, Jenna and Barbara, and Princess Beatrice. Additionally, actual UC Berkeley students created in 2004 the Sandy Cohen Public Defender Fellowship in honor of Peter Gallagher&#x27;s character Sandy Cohen. The fellowship is awarded to students who plan to work as public defenders and has been presented by Gallagher.

Comedy group The Lonely Island created a parody of &quot;The O.C.&quot; called The &#x27;Bu. At Boston College, students created and produced a parody titled &quot;The BC&quot; that received nationwide acclaim and features in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. On April 14, 2007, Saturday Night Live aired a Digital Short titled &quot;Dear Sister&quot; that satirized the final scene of &quot;The O.C.&quot;″s second-season finale. The short became popular enough to beget a wave of re-enactments and parodies using &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; with the music set to slow-motion scenes of violence from various films and television series. In 2020, the Netflix show Outer Banks was compared to The O.C. on websites such as Glamour. 

Marvel described &quot;Runaways&quot; (created for television by Schwartz and Savage) as &quot;The O.C.&quot; of the Marvel Universe, even before they hired Schwartz and Savage to run the series.

Independent Washington University in St. Louis newspaper Student Life said that, &quot;&quot;The O.C.&quot;″s&quot; legacy will live on through its viewers. Whether you wear a &#x27;Save Marissa&#x27; shirt, a leather wristcuff or hoodie in honor of Ryan or listen to Death Cab for Cutie, as Seth did, know that &quot;The O.C.&quot; was a cultural phenomenon that will not be forgotten.&quot;

===Spin-offs===
&quot;The O.C.&quot; has given rise to a number of spin-offs, some developed and others not. &quot;Atomic County&quot; was a spin-off based on the cartoon characters in Seth&#x27;s comic book of the same name. It was created by &quot;The O.C.&quot; writer John Stephens and artist Eric Wight, who was responsible for the comic book drawings featured on the show.

In 2005, Schwartz announced he was writing a spin-off which followed the life of Marissa&#x27;s younger sister Kaitlin at boarding school. It was set to premiere in January 2006, but the airing of the spin-off never occurred. Schwartz attributed this to Gail Berman, president of Fox Broadcasting Company, moving to Paramount in May 2005.

There were plans to turn the show into something of a reverse spin-off. Schwartz planned to release a spin-off of his series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; entitled &quot;Valley Girls&quot;, originally to premiere in the fall of 2009. Schwartz wanted to tie in the younger versions of the characters from both &quot;The O.C.&quot; and the principals from &quot;Valley Girls&quot; to establish a continuity with &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;.

The O.C. Musical took place on August 30, 2015, at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles, selling out in minutes when tickets went on sale earlier that same month. While not officially authorized by FOX or Warner Bros. TV, Sucker Love Productions&#x27; musical was supported by the show&#x27;s cast and producers, with Autumn Reeser portraying Julie Cooper and briefly reprising her role as Taylor Townsend for the first time in 8 years. Creator Josh Schwartz and stars Rachel Bilson, Melinda Clarke, and Kelly Rowan also reunited at the musical. The cast included &quot;Awkward&quot; star Greer Grammer as Summer Roberts and &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; star Brendan Robinson as Seth Cohen.

<text>Mischa Anne Marsden Barton (born 24 January 1986) is a British-American film, television, and stage actress. She began her career on the stage, appearing in Tony Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Slavs!&quot; and took the lead in James Lapine&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Dreams&quot; at New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Center. She made her screen debut with a guest appearance on the American soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; (1995), and voicing Betty Ann Bongo on the Nickelodeon cartoon series &quot;KaBlam!&quot; (1996–97). Her first major film role was as the protagonist of &quot;Lawn Dogs&quot; (1997), a drama co-starring Sam Rockwell. She appeared in major pictures such as the romantic comedy &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999) and M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999). She also starred in the indie crime drama &quot;Pups&quot; (1999).

Barton later appeared in the independent drama &quot;Lost and Delirious&quot; (2001) and guest-starred as Evan Rachel Wood&#x27;s girlfriend on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Once and Again&quot; (2001–02). She played Marissa Cooper in the Fox television series &quot;The O.C.&quot; (2003–2006), for which she received two Teen Choice Awards. The role brought Barton into mainstream fame, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named her the &quot;It Girl&quot; of 2003.

Barton has since appeared in the comedy remake &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (2007), the Richard Attenborough–directed drama &quot;Closing the Ring&quot; (2007) and &quot;Assassination of a High School President&quot; (2008). She returned to television, starring in the short-lived Ashton Kutcher-produced CW series &quot;The Beautiful Life&quot; (2009).

In 2012, she returned to the stage, performing in the Irish production of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;. She also appeared alongside Martin Sheen in &quot;&quot; (2014). She has garnered critical praise for her roles in independent films, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praising her &quot;standout&quot; performance in &quot;Starcrossed&quot; (2014). Barton was cast in the first season of the MTV series &quot;The Hills: New Beginnings&quot; (2019–2021), a reboot of &quot;The Hills&quot;. In 2023, she was cast in an extended guest role for the rebooted Australian soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot; on Amazon Freevee and Network 10.

==Early life==
Barton was born at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital in Hammersmith, London, to an Irish mother, Nuala Quinn-Barton, a producer, and an English father, Paul Marsden Barton, a foreign exchange broker from Manchester.

Her maternal grandfather was an Irish language professor at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. She has two sisters, Hania (younger) and Zoë (older), the latter a barrister (KC) in London. Barton has stated that she briefly attended St. Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School in Hammersmith, but her father&#x27;s work took the family to New York City when Barton was five years old. In 2006, she became a naturalised citizen of the United States, but retained her British citizenship. She is also eligible for Irish citizenship through her mother.

Barton graduated from the Professional Children&#x27;s School in Manhattan in 2004, and took a summer short course called Acting Shakespeare at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, in June and July 2006, at Sir Richard Attenborough&#x27;s urging, after he directed her in &quot;Closing the Ring&quot;.

==Career==
===1994–1997: Stage roles===
Barton began acting at the age of eight, co-starring in the off-Broadway premiere of the 1994 play, &quot;Slavs!&quot;, written by Tony Kushner. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Barton&#x27;s &quot;so fine&quot; and &quot;chillingly authoritative&quot; performance. &quot;New York&quot; magazine also praised her as &quot;a darling little girl, [that] exhibits consummate charm&quot;. She appeared in several other Off-Broadway productions, taking a lead role in James Lapine&#x27;s &quot;Twelve Dreams&quot; alongside Marisa Tomei at Lincoln Center. Canby again praised Barton, noting that she &quot;has a sweet gravity as the doomed Emma&quot;. In 1996 Barton had a supporting role in Catherine Butterfield&#x27;s &quot;Where the Truth Lies&quot; which opened at New York&#x27;s Irish Repertory Theatre. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also remarked that &quot;the winning child actresses Brittany Boyd and Mischa Barton are already smart enough not to overplay the naivete and precocity of their respective characters.&quot; In 1997, she appeared alongside Dianne Wiest at The Public Theater in Naomi Wallace&#x27;s &quot;One Flea Spare&quot;. The New York production went on to win the Obie Award for Best Play.

===1997–2003: Feature films and television===
She made her film debut in &quot;Lawn Dogs&quot;, which won awards at film festivals around the world. Barton won critical favour for her role, with Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praising her &quot;poised&quot; performance and &quot;Empire&quot; celebrating her &quot;hypnotic central performance&quot;. Barton then appeared in &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1999). Both films were critically and commercially successful, respectively earning $363,889,700 and $672,806,292. She also starred in &quot;Pups&quot;, a &quot;&quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; for the MTV generation&quot;, alongside Burt Reynolds; along with her co-star Cameron Van Hoy, film critic Roger Ebert called their work in the film &quot;two of the most natural and freed performances I have seen by actors of any age.&quot;

Barton first appeared on television in 1994, playing a young Corvina Lang in flashbacks in the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. In 1996, she returned to the show, replacing Michelle Trachtenberg in the role of Lily Benton Montgomery. She guest-starred in eight episodes of the television series &quot;Once and Again&quot; as Jessie Sammler&#x27;s (Evan Rachel Wood) girlfriend, Katie Singer. In 2001, she returned to film and starred in the independent Canadian drama, &quot;Lost and Delirious&quot;, based on the novel &quot;The Wives of Bath&quot; by Susan Swan. The film was met with mixed reviews, but the performances of Barton and her co-stars Piper Perabo and Jessica Paré were widely praised. She also starred in &quot;Julie Johnson&quot; (2001) alongside Lili Taylor and Courtney Love, playing the daughter of a woman in a lesbian relationship. Barton also had a supporting role in the independent teen drama &quot;Tart&quot; (2001) with Brad Renfro and Dominique Swain.

Other television appearances include an episode of the Fox series &quot;Fastlane&quot; (2003). She also appears as the love interest in James Blunt&#x27;s music video &quot;Goodbye My Lover&quot; (2005) and in Enrique Iglesias&#x27; music video &quot;Addicted&quot; (2003).

===2003–2007: &quot;The O.C.&quot;===
In August 2003, Fox premiered the television series &quot;The O.C.&quot;, about affluent teenagers with stormy personal lives who reside in scenic Orange County, California. The show became an overnight success due to its large fanbase, and resulted in Barton&#x27;s fame being increased through her role as Marissa Cooper. Barton departed from the show in the third-season finale in May 2006. During her time on the show, Barton garnered several Teen Choice Awards. She was also celebrated by &quot;Glamour&quot; as the &quot;Next Big Thing&quot;. &quot;The O.C.&quot; dropped in ratings dramatically during its third and fourth seasons, and ended in early 2007.

In July 2006, Barton appeared on the British comedy variety show &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot; as a guest host. In 2007, Barton appeared in the films &quot;The Oh in Ohio&quot; and the comedy film &quot;Virgin Territory&quot; with Hayden Christensen. She also joined Shirley MacLaine and Christopher Plummer in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s war drama &quot;Closing the Ring&quot;. Attenborough praised her, saying &quot;her ability to convey pain and sadness, hopefulness and fear, is riveting&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; also noted that &quot;she lends her character a beguiling vulnerability.&quot; She also appeared in the British comedy &quot;St Trinians&quot; (2007), appearing as a former head girl of that school advising current senior pupils on fashion and style. Later in 2007, Barton was cast in the international film produced by the Russian band t.A.T.u., called &quot;You and I&quot;. The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008 and was released theatrically in Russia in 2011.

===2008–2018: Independent films===
She appeared in &quot;Assassination of a High School President&quot; (2008), co-starring Bruce Willis, which premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised Barton&#x27;s &quot;captivating&quot; performance. She also starred in the horror film &quot;Walled In&quot;, which was released straight-to-DVD in March 2009. It received mixed reviews, but her performance was praised, with IGN calling her performance &quot;terrific&quot;. Her next horror project, &quot;Homecoming&quot;, received a limited release in July 2009. Barton did not attend the premiere of the psychological thriller due to a medical issue. She also starred in the 2009 film &quot;Don&#x27;t Fade Away&quot;. In early 2009 she began filming alongside Martin Sheen in &quot;&quot; a biopic of the Bhopal gas tragedy.

In a December 2007 interview, she indicated she would return to television for the right project; &quot;It&#x27;s not that I dislike doing television at all. It would be interesting having more creative control over where the storylines go or the characters. But for the right thing, of course.&quot; In 2009 she starred as one of the main characters on &quot;The Beautiful Life&quot; a new series on The CW. The series was subsequently cancelled on 25 September 2009 after broadcasting two episodes. In December 2009, the technology company HP became the show&#x27;s sponsor, airing the show&#x27;s five episodes on YouTube. She guest starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, played an endangered prostitute in an episode that aired on 3 March 2010. She has since mainly filmed horror and thriller projects, taking roles in &quot;The Sibling&quot;, &quot;Cyberstalker&quot;, a Lifetime television film and &quot;Apartment 1303 3D&quot;, the English-language remake of the Japanese horror film, &quot;Apartment 1303&quot;. Barton also appeared alongside Ryan Eggold in Mark Edwin Robinson&#x27;s supernatural romance thriller, &quot;Into the Dark&quot;.

In May 2012, Barton discussed her recent preference for the horror genre, following roles in &quot;Homecoming&quot;, &quot;Apartment 1303&quot; and &quot;Sibling&quot; &quot;I literally became obsessed with that genre. I can&#x27;t tell you. Because I never watched it when I was younger; it used to be way too terrifying for me.&quot; However Barton added that, &quot;I think I&#x27;ve gone through my little phase, for the moment.&quot; In June, Barton appeared in Noel Gallagher&#x27;s music video for &quot;Everybody&#x27;s on the Run&quot;. In July 2012, Barton made her stage return in an Irish production of &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;, playing Shelby. It premiered at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin on 12 September, and a nationwide tour followed thereafter. After the premiere, Barton received praise for her performance. The &quot;Evening Herald&quot; wrote &quot;Barton sparkles from the moment she steps on stage...Barton&#x27;s Shelby is instantly magnetic&quot;.

On 8 March 2016, Barton competed on the 22nd season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. She paired with professional dancer Artem Chigvintsev. On 4 April 2016, Barton and Chigvintsev were eliminated from the competition and finished in eleventh place. Later in 2016 Barton received praise for her role in the independent drama &quot;Starcrossed&quot;. Writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Katie Walsh described how &quot;Barton is a standout as the alluring, broken young woman who hides as much as she reveals.&quot; Barton was later critically recognized for her performance in &quot;Deserted&quot;, a psychological survival story written and directed by Ashley Avis. Barton plays Jae, a young woman recently released from prison who goes on a soul-searching journey into the desert with her brother Robin, played by Jackson Davis. &quot;Barton is well-cast, grounded and burdened,&quot; and &quot;...delivers one of her best performances in years.&quot; In 2018, Barton was cast in &quot;The Cat and the Moon&quot;, the directorial debut of Alex Wolff.

===2019–present: &quot;The Hills&quot; reboot, &quot;Neighbours&quot; and film roles===
At the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, MTV announced a reboot of &quot;The Hills&quot; titled &quot;The Hills: New Beginnings&quot;, slated to premiere in 2019. Barton was announced as part of the cast of the new series. She did not return for the second season. Barton had a cameo appearance in &quot;Spree&quot;, which starred Joe Keery of &quot;Stranger Things&quot; and premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival. In October 2021, Barton was tapped to play an aspiring detective Miranda Green in the crime thriller film &quot;Invitation to a Murder&quot;, directed by Stephen Shimek.

In April 2023 it was announced that Barton would be a guest star in the rebooted Australian soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot; on Amazon Freevee and Australia&#x27;s Network 10. Barton plays Reece Sinclair, who is the daughter of an American billionaire investing in Lassiters. 

In 2025, Barton will star in &quot;Sleepwalker&quot;, a psychological thriller alongside Hayden Panettiere and Justin Chatwin.

==Modelling, fashion design, and endorsements==
Barton has been in many television commercials and print advertising campaigns. Barton has modeled for companies Calvin Klein, bebe stores, Aéropostale, Monsoon Accessorize, Dooney &amp; Bourke, JC (Jeans and Clothes), European clothing line Morgan de Toi, Jaspal, and Neutrogena skincare products. She became the spokesperson for Keds Sneakers, substantially increasing their sales. In Australia, she appears in commercials for teen magazine &quot;Famous&quot; and was the guest of honour at retail giant David Jones Tahitian Summer Collection launch. She has also endorsed Chanel jewelry, appearing at events for the brand. In a 2005 interview, she stated that she liked the Chanel brand because they produced a large number of clip-on earrings suitable for women who did not have pierced ears, as she did not at the time. In 2009, having had her ears pierced for her role in &quot;The Beautiful Life&quot;, she modeled jewelry for the company Inspired Creations, including pierced earrings and their Waxing Poetic range of charms.

Barton is a self-admitted fan of magic. In addition to being a guest member of the Magic Castle, she is also friends with a number of magicians and has often acted as a guest assistant to some of them, participating in illusions including being guillotined and sawed in half.

In 2008, she won the &quot;InStyle&quot; &quot;icon of the year&quot; award from Karl Lagerfeld at the Viper awards in Berlin.

Barton also became a spokesperson for the SAFE (Skin Awareness for Everyone) campaign in 2007. In addition, she lent her name to the TRAID campaign (Textile Recycling for Aid and International Development) in association with Visa Swap. Barton was photographed in April 2007 for the Fall 2007/2008 advertising campaign for Italian clothing brand Iceberg, modelling with Nicolas Bemberg.

In July 2008, she created a 14-piece handbag collection for online retailer ASOS.com. Barton was reportedly very involved in the line which retails from £20 to £145. She told ASOS magazine that she first discovered the website through her sister.

In December 2008, Barton premiered her line of headbands released on the Stacy Lapidus line. The headbands cost from $90 to $200. She also has a handbag line for London-based Ri2k, which is sold in the United Kingdom and Australia only. In early 2009, she became the &quot;new face&quot; of Herbal Essences.

In June 2010, she was announced as the face of Philipp Plein couture. Plein said, &quot;Being in the limelight for a young and beautiful girl, the looks of course always get a lot of attention, Mischa Barton got a lot and learned to live with her fame. For me it was the big challenge to again show her as a Diva, a Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Goddess&quot;. The campaign will be circulated in international editions of leading fashion magazines.

In May 2011, Barton became the &quot;exceptional godmother&quot; of the Catalan designer Rosa Clará for her 2011 collection at Barcelona Bridal Week. Along with the Mexican singer Paulina Rubio, they became the stars of the show to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the signature of wedding dresses from Barcelona.

In October 2011, Barton appeared in a meat-themed photoshoot for Tyler Shields that was showcased at the Imitate Modern Gallery in London.

In 2012, Barton opened a short-lived clothes boutique in Spitafields, London, later revealing “Retail is not exactly a cakewalk, so just taking care of the store and dealing with production, quality and employees. Just the whole thing became overwhelming and beyond expensive.”

==Personal life==
Barton purchased a home in Beverly Hills at age nineteen, and subsequently sold the home in 2016. She was previously in long-term relationships with the oil heir Brandon Davis, musician Cisco Adler, and the Australian model James Abercrombie. In 2017, Barton won a revenge porn lawsuit against her former boyfriend, Jon Zacharias, stopping him from selling a sex tape of her.

In 2007, Barton was arrested in Los Angeles for drunk driving, marijuana possession, and driving without a license. She pled no contest and was sentenced to three years of unsupervised probation.

&quot;The O.C.&quot; creator Josh Schwartz later said that &quot;Mischa was one of the young women stalked by photographers and treated unkindly by online bloggers. Fame hit in a certain way that would have been very hard for anyone to predict&quot;. Barton wrote in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in 2021 that she felt that she had been &quot;sexualised&quot; in her earlier film roles, even becoming a &quot;strange sex symbol&quot; at 13 in Asia where her movie &quot;Pups&quot; garnered significant attention. She also revealed that she felt pressure to lose her virginity at age 18 when she joined the cast of &quot;The OC&quot; as her character was sexually active. Barton also revealed that persistent press attention and paparazzi intrusion led to her having PTSD. In 2023, an article from 2005 circulated in which Barton stated a Hollywood publicist told her to sleep with Leonardo DiCaprio when she was just 18 years old in order to benefit her career.

===Charitable affiliations===
In 2009, Barton served as the spokesperson for Climate Star, an organization that fights global warming through social and legislative activism. In 2007, she worked with the home shopping company QVC to raise funds for women&#x27;s cancer research.

In 2006, Barton served as a spokesperson for the SAFE (Skin Awareness for Everyone) campaign and also lent her name to the TRAID campaign (Textile Recycling for Aid and International Development) in 2007, in association with Visa Swap. In 2007, Barton also served as an ambassador for Save the Children and the &quot;One Water&quot; campaign which brings water to remote locations in Africa, and was on the board of the Lupus Research Committee in Los Angeles.

<text>The Sadleirian Professorship of Pure Mathematics, originally spelled in the statutes and for the first two professors as Sadlerian, is a professorship in pure mathematics within the DPMMS at the University of Cambridge. It was founded on a bequest from Lady Mary Sadleir for lectureships &quot;for the full and clear explication and teaching that part of mathematical knowledge commonly called algebra&quot;. She died in 1706 and lectures began in 1710 but eventually these failed to attract undergraduates. In 1860 the foundation was used to establish the professorship. On 10 June 1863 Arthur Cayley was elected with the statutory duty &quot;to explain and teach the principles of pure mathematics, and to apply himself to the advancement of that science.&quot; The stipend attached to the professorship was modest although it improved in the course of subsequent legislation.

<text>Citizens for a Canadian Republic (French: &quot;Citoyens pour une République Canadienne&quot;) (CCR) is a Canadian advocacy group founded in 2002 that advocates for the replacement of the Canadian monarchy with a head of state who could either be chosen directly through a general election, indirectly by the Parliament of Canada, the Legislative assemblies of Canadian provinces and territories, or some other electoral body.

CCR favours the retention of the Westminster-style parliament, with the prime minister as head of government, in a parliamentary republic similar to Ireland or India. It does not endorse any particular selection process, other than it should be democratic. The organization&#x27;s general objective is &quot;to promote replacing the British monarch as our head of state with a resident, democratically-selected Canadian. &quot;

==History==
===Founding===

Citizens for a Canadian Republic was formed in 2002 &quot;in an effort to provide balance in the debate over whether or not Canada should remain a constitutional monarchy&quot; and to advocate for the &quot;Canadianization&quot; of the head of state. It remains the only formal organization devoted to the establishment of a Canadian republic.

===O&#x27;Donohue v. Canada===
That same year, CCR became involved in &quot;O&#x27;Donohue v. Canada&quot;, a lawsuit filed by one of its members, Tony O&#x27;Donohue. This suit challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions of the &quot;Act of Settlement, 1701&quot;, one of the laws governing succession to the Canadian throne, which disallows the sovereign from either being or being married to a Roman Catholic. O&#x27;Donohue argued that it thus violates the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. The case was dismissed in 2003, a ruling that was upheld in 2005, part of the rationale behind the decision being that, as the Act of Settlement is a constitutional document on equal-footing with the &quot;Charter&quot;, it could not be pre-empted by the &quot;Charter&quot;.

===Oath of Allegiance===
The co-founder of CCR, Pierre L. J. Vincent, became a republican activist in 1998 when he objected to taking the &quot;Oath of Allegiance&quot;, then required by law for all Canadian public servants beginning employment within the Civil Service. His refusal, partly based on his Acadian ancestry, sparked a publicized three-year legal battle involving the Government of Canada&#x27;s Public Service Commission.

In 2001, the commission ruled that he could keep his job, a legal precedent that was later applied to a similar oath refusal. Both cases are recognized as being a major impetus for the 2003 &quot;Public Service Modernization Act&quot;, which ended the requirement for Government of Canada civil servants to swear an oath to the Queen as of December 31, 2005.

In 2007, former CCR member Charles Roach filed suit in opposition to the requirement of new citizens to swear an oath to the Queen. The case was on May 17, 2007, allowed to proceed, but has since been dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.

==Organization and structure==
CCR&#x27;s national director and principal anglophone spokesperson is Tom Freda. Associate director and principal francophone and Western Canada spokesperson is Pierre L. J. Vincent. Associate Director Jamie Bradley is the principal Atlantic Canada spokesperson. Other prominent members of the group&#x27;s Advisory Committee include Christopher Moore and Brigadier-General James S. Cox.

<doc id="291590" wikidata="Q1660551" url="?curid=291590" title="In-circuit emulation">
<text>In-circuit emulation (ICE) is the use of a hardware device or in-circuit emulator used to debug the software of an embedded system. It operates by using a processor with the additional ability to support debugging operations, as well as to carry out the main function of the system. Particularly for older systems, with limited processors, this usually involved replacing the processor temporarily with a hardware emulator: a more powerful although more expensive version. It was historically in the form of bond-out processor which has many internal signals brought out for the purpose of debugging. These signals provide information about the state of the processor.

More recently the term also covers JTAG-based hardware debuggers which provide equivalent access using on-chip debugging hardware with standard production chips. Using standard chips instead of custom bond-out versions makes the technology ubiquitous and low cost, and eliminates most differences between the development and runtime environments. In this common case, the &quot;in-circuit emulator&quot; term is a misnomer, sometimes confusingly so, because emulation is no longer involved.

Embedded systems present special problems for programmers because they usually lack keyboards, monitors, disk drives and other user interfaces that are present on computers. These shortcomings make in-circuit software debugging tools essential for many common development tasks.

==Function==
An in-circuit emulator (ICE) provides a window into the embedded system. The programmer uses the emulator to load programs into the embedded system, run them, step through them slowly, and view and change data used by the system&#x27;s software.

An &quot;emulator&quot; gets its name because it emulates (imitates) the central processing unit (CPU) of the embedded system&#x27;s computer. Traditionally it had a plug that inserts into the socket where the CPU integrated circuit chip would normally be placed. Most modern systems use the target system&#x27;s CPU directly, with special JTAG-based debug access. Emulating the processor, or direct JTAG access to it, lets the ICE do anything that the processor can do, but under the control of a software developer.

ICEs attach a computer terminal or personal computer (PC) to the embedded system. The terminal or PC provides an interactive user interface for the programmer to investigate and control the embedded system. For example, it is routine to have a source code level debugger with a graphical windowing interface that communicates through a JTAG adapter (emulator) to an embedded target system which has no graphical user interface.

Notably, when their program fails, most embedded systems simply become bricked. Embedded systems often lack basic functions to detect signs of software failure, such as a memory management unit (MMU) to catch memory access errors. Without an ICE, the development of embedded systems can be extremely difficult, because there is usually no way to tell what went wrong. With an ICE, the programmer can usually test pieces of code, then isolate the fault to a particular section of code, and then inspect the failing code and rewrite it to solve the problem.

In usage, an ICE provides the programmer with execution breakpoints, memory display and monitoring, and input/output control. Beyond this, the ICE can be programmed to look for any range of matching criteria to pause at, in an attempt to identify the origin of a failure.

Most modern microcontrollers use resources provided on the manufactured version of the microcontroller for device programming, emulating, and debugging features, instead of needing another special emulation-version (that is, bond-out) of the target microcontroller. Even though it is a cost-effective method, since the ICE unit only manages the emulation instead of actually emulating the target microcontroller, trade-offs must be made to keep prices low at manufacture time, yet provide enough emulation features for the (relatively few) emulation applications.

==Advantages==
Virtually all embedded systems have a hardware element and a software element, which are separate but tightly interdependent. The ICE allows the software element to be run and tested on the hardware on which it is to run, but still allows programmer conveniences to help isolate faulty code, such as &quot;source-level debugging&quot; (which shows a program as it was originally written) and &quot;single-stepping&quot; (which lets programmers run programs step-by-step to find errors).

Most ICEs consist of an adaptor unit that sits between the ICE host computer and the system to be tested. A pin header and cable assembly connects the adaptor to a socket where the actual central processing unit (CPU) or microcontroller mounts within the embedded system. Recent ICEs enable programmers to access the on-chip debug circuit that is integrated into the CPU via JTAG or background debug mode interface (BDM) to debug the software of an embedded system. These systems often use a standard version of the CPU chip, and can simply attach to a debug port on a production system. They are sometimes called in-circuit debuggers or ICDs, to distinguish the fact that they do not replicate the functionality of the CPU, but instead control an already existing, standard CPU. Since the CPU need not be replaced, they can operate on production units where the CPU is soldered in and cannot be replaced. On x86 Pentiums, a special &#x27;probe mode&#x27; is used by ICEs to aid in debugging.

In the context of embedded systems, the ICE is not emulating hardware. Rather, it is providing direct debug access to the actual CPU. The system under test is under full control, allowing the developer to load, debug and test code directly.

Most host systems are ordinary commercial computers unrelated to the CPU used for development. For example, a Linux PC might be used to develop software for a system using a Freescale 68HC11 chip, a processor that cannot run Linux.

The programmer usually edits and compiles the embedded system&#x27;s code on the host system, as well. The host system will have special compilers that produce executable code for the embedded system, termed cross compilers or cross assemblers.

== On-chip debugging ==
&quot;On-chip debugging&quot; is an alternative to in-circuit emulation. It uses a different approach to address a similar goal.

On-chip debugging, often loosely termed as &quot;Joint Test Action Group&quot; (JTAG), uses the provision of an additional debugging interface to the live hardware, in the production system. It provides the same features as in-circuit debugging, such as inspection of internal state or variables and may have the ability to set checkpoints, breakpoints and watchpoints. The difference is that this is provided by additional silicon within the production processor, rather than swapping the processor for an off-board debugging emulator. For this reason, some of the functions of the ICE is changed by the specifications of the processor. An additional JTAG interface is added to the controller board, and this is required on every production system, but as this only requires a few signal pins the extra cost is minimal. JTAG interfaces were originally developed for, and are still useful for, end of production testing.

==Intel==
To support in-circuit emulator (ICE) debugging on Intel 286, five additional pins were available on the processor: one input pin to externally force an ICE breakpoint, (codice_1) and two alternative pairs of output pins to select operations via the ICE-bus instead of user memory. On the 80286 two instructions (codice_2, codice_3) exist to dump/restore the complete CPU state to memory offset 0x800, along with a single-byte override prefix (codice_4) to enable ICE-mode to access user-memory.

<text>John Frank Stossel (born March 6, 1947) is an American libertarian television presenter, author, consumer journalist, political activist, and pundit. He is known for his career as a host on ABC News, Fox Business Network, and Reason TV.

Stossel&#x27;s style combines reporting and commentary. It reflects a &quot;small L&quot; libertarian political philosophy and views on economics which are largely supportive of the free market. He began his journalism career as a researcher for KGW-TV, was a consumer reporter at WCBS-TV in New York City, and then joined ABC News as a consumer editor and reporter on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Stossel became an ABC News correspondent, joining the weekly news magazine program &quot;20/20&quot;, and later became a co-anchor. In October 2009, Stossel left ABC News to join the Fox Business Network. He hosted a weekly news show on Fox Business, &quot;Stossel&quot;, from December 2009 to December 2016. In 2019, Stossel launched StosselTV, an online channel distributed on social media.

Stossel has received 19 Emmy Awards and five awards from the National Press Club. He has written three books: &quot;Give Me a Break&quot; (2004), &quot;Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity&quot; (2007), and &quot;No, They Can&#x27;t: Why Government Fails – But Individuals Succeed&quot; (2012).

==Early life==
John F. Stossel was born on March 6, 1947, in Chicago Heights, Illinois, the younger of two sons, to Jewish parents who left Germany before Hitler rose to power. The family joined a Congregationalist church in the U.S., and Stossel was raised Protestant. He grew up on Chicago&#x27;s affluent North Shore and graduated from New Trier High School. Stossel characterizes his older brother, Thomas P. Stossel, as &quot;the superstar of the family&quot;, commenting, &quot;While I partied and played poker, he studied hard, got top grades, and went to Harvard Medical School.&quot; Stossel characterizes himself as having been &quot;an indifferent student&quot; while in college, commenting, &quot;I daydreamed through half my classes at Princeton, and applied to grad school only because I was ambitious, and grad school seemed like the right path for a 21-year-old who wanted to get ahead.&quot; Although he had been accepted to the University of Chicago&#x27;s School of Hospital Management, Stossel was &quot;sick of school&quot; and thought taking a job would inspire him to embrace graduate studies with renewed vigor. Stossel recalled in an interview that after graduating college, &quot;like a lot of young people I thought capitalism was ok it brings us some stuff but it&#x27;s cruel and unfair&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career===
In school, Stossel aspired to work at &quot;Seattle Magazine&quot;, but it went out of business by the time he graduated. His contacts there assisted him in getting a job at KGW-TV in Portland, Oregon, where Stossel began as a newsroom gofer, working his way up to researcher and then writer. After a few years, the news director told Stossel to go on the air and read what he wrote. Despite his stage fright, Stossel says his fear spurred him to improve, examining and imitating broadcasts of David Brinkley and Jack Perkins. Stossel had also stuttered since childhood. After a few years of on-air reporting, Stossel was hired by WCBS-TV in New York City, by Ed Joyce, the same news director who hired Arnold Diaz, Linda Ellerbee, Dave Marash, Joel Siegel and Lynn Sherr. Stossel was disappointed at CBS, feeling that the more limited amount of time spent there on research lowered the quality of its journalism compared to Portland. Stossel cites union work rules that discouraged the extra work that Stossel felt allowed employees to be creative, which he says represented his &quot;first real introduction to the deals made by special interests&quot;. Stossel also &quot;hated&quot; Joyce, who he felt was &quot;cold and critical&quot;, though Stossel credits Joyce with allowing him the freedom to pursue his own story ideas, and with recommending the Hollins Communications Research Institute in Roanoke, Virginia, that helped Stossel manage his stutter.

Stossel grew continuously more frustrated with having to follow the assignment editor&#x27;s vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if he were forced to compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the women&#x27;s movement, the growth of computer technology, and advancements in contraception, rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires, or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel&#x27;s ideas were better, and approved them. Stossel has served as a spokesman for the Stuttering Foundation of America.

===&quot;20/20&quot;===
In 1981 Roone Arledge offered Stossel a job at ABC News, as a correspondent for &quot;20/20&quot; and consumer reporter for &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. His &quot;Give Me a Break&quot; segments for the former featured a skeptical look at subjects from government regulations and pop culture to censorship and unfounded fear. The series was spun off into a series of one-hour specials with budgets of half a million dollars that began in 1994. During the course of his work on &quot;20/20&quot;, Stossel wrote, he discovered &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, whose libertarian ideas appealed to him. Stossel later said in an interview that the regulations he urged governments to pass did not work. After coming out as a libertarian, Stossel said, he angered members of the political left, his news colleagues and others. Stossel was named co-anchor of &quot;20/20&quot; in May 2003, while he was writing his first book, &quot;Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media&quot;, which was published in 2004. In it, he details his start in journalism and consumer reporting, and how he evolved to harbor libertarian beliefs.

===Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network===

In September 2009, it was announced that Stossel was leaving Disney&#x27;s ABC News and joining News Corp.&#x27;s Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network. In addition to appearing on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; every Tuesday night, he also hosted a one-hour weekly program for Fox Business Network and a series of one-hour specials for Fox News Channel, as well as making regular guest appearances on Fox News programs.

The program, &quot;Stossel&quot;, debuted December 10, 2009, on Fox Business Network. The program examined issues related to individual freedom, free market capitalism and small government, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade. The final episode premiered on December 16, 2016. At the end of that episode, a retrospective that spotlighted moments from seven years of the program, Stossel explained that due to his age, he wanted to help develop a younger generation of journalists with his views, and would continue to appear as a guest on Fox programs, and also help produce content for Reason TV. His blog, &quot;Stossel&#x27;s Take&quot;, is published on both FoxBusiness.com and FoxNews.com.

=== Stossel TV ===
In 2019, Stossel launched Stossel TV, an online channel which distributes weekly videos via social media platforms.

===Publications===

Stossel has written three books. &quot;Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media&quot; is a 2005 autobiography from Harper Perennial documenting his career and philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. &quot;Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel – Why Everything You Know Is Wrong&quot;, which was published in 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon &amp; Schuster, published Stossel&#x27;s third book &quot;No, They Can&#x27;t: Why Government Fails – But Individuals Succeed&quot;. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.

With financial support from the libertarian Palmer R. Chitester Fund, Stossel and ABC News launched a series of educational materials for public schools in 1999 entitled &quot;Stossel in the Classroom&quot;. It was taken over in 2006 by the Center for Independent Thought and releases a new DVD of teaching materials annually. In 2006, Stossel and ABC released &quot;Teaching Tools for Economics&quot;, a video series based on the National Council of Economics Education standards.

Since February 2011, Stossel has written a weekly newspaper column for Creators Syndicate. His articles appear in such online publications as Newsmax, &quot;Reason&quot;, and Townhall.

==Political positions==
Stossel purports to debunk myths in his journalism. His &quot;Myths and Lies&quot; series of &quot;20/20&quot; specials challenges a range of liberal beliefs. He also hosted &quot;The Power of Belief&quot; (October 6, 1998), an ABC News Special that focused on assertions of the paranormal and people&#x27;s desire to believe. Another report put forward the argument that opposition to DDT is misplaced and that the ban on DDT has resulted in the deaths of millions of children, mostly in poor nations.

===Libertarianism===

As a libertarian who has said he usually votes for the Libertarian Party, Stossel says that he believes in both personal freedom and the free market. He frequently uses television airtime to advance these views and challenge viewers&#x27; distrust of free-market capitalism and economic competition. He received an Honoris Causa Doctorate from Francisco Marroquin University, a libertarian university in Guatemala, in 2008.

Stossel argues that individual self-interest, or &quot;greed&quot;, creates an incentive to work harder and to innovate. He argues that this innovation makes the poor richer and the only way people &quot;can get rich is to offer us something that we believe is better than we had before.&quot; He promoted school choice as a way to improve American public schools akin to the Belgian voucher system.

Stossel has criticized government programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful. He has also criticized the American legal system, opining that it provides lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are necessary in order to provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power, he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits.

Stossel opposes the minimum wage, corporate welfare and welfare more broadly, bailouts, seat belt laws, occupational licensing and the war in Iraq. He also opposes legal prohibitions against pornography, marijuana, recreational drugs, gambling, ticket scalping, prostitution, polygamy, and assisted suicide, and believes most abortions should be legal. He has said he supports the rule of law, gun rights, pollution control, and lower and simpler taxes. He has endorsed or explored various ideas in his specials and on his TV series for changing the tax system, including switching to a flat tax, and replacing the income tax with the FairTax.

Stossel argues that a country needs to have police and a national defense as laid out by the United States Constitution. Stossel acknowledges that Scandinavian countries have large welfare states, but says that they can only afford them &quot;because they have a homogeneous culture and they have a fairly free private market to pay for it&quot; while also noting that they have no government-mandated minimum wage.

When the Department of Labor reissued federal guidelines in April 2010 governing the employment of unpaid interns under the Fair Labor Standards Act based on a 1947 Supreme Court decision, Stossel criticized the guidelines, appearing in a police uniform during an appearance on the Fox News program &quot;America Live&quot;, commenting, &quot;I&#x27;ve built my career on unpaid interns, and the interns told me it was great – I learned more from you than I did in college.&quot; Asked why he did not pay them if they were so valuable, he said he could not afford to.

Stossel is a faculty member of the Charles Koch Institute.

Stossel has advocated in favor of abolishing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

On April 1, 2016, Stossel moderated the first-ever nationally televised Libertarian presidential debate. The second part of the debate aired on April 8. On May 21, 2020, he moderated the Libertarian Party National Convention Presidential Debate between Jacob Hornberger, Vermin Supreme, Jo Jorgensen, Jim Gray, and John Monds.

=== Science ===
In 2001, the progressive media watchdog organization FAIR criticized Stossel&#x27;s reportage of global warming in his documentary, &quot;Tampering with Nature,&quot; accusing it of using &quot;highly selective...information&quot; that placed undue emphasis on three dissenters from among the 2,000 members of the UN&#x27;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which had recently released a report stating that global temperatures were rising almost twice as fast as previously thought.

In December 2014, Stossel stated that &quot;There is no good data showing secondhand smoke kills people.&quot; The fact-checker website Politifact rated this statement &quot;False&quot;, citing considerable levels of scientific research showing that secondhand smoke has caused deaths.

==Praise and criticism==
===Awards===
As of 2001, Stossel had won 19 Emmy Awards. He was honored five times for excellence in consumer reporting by the National Press Club, has received a George Polk Award for Outstanding Local Reporting and a Peabody Award. On April 23, 2012, Stossel was awarded the Chapman University Presidential Medal, by the current president, James Doti, and chancellor, Danielle Struppa. The award has been presented to only a handful of people over the past 150 years. Stossel received an honorary doctorate from Universidad Francisco Marroquín.

===Praise===
In promotional copy for one of Stossel&#x27;s books, the Nobel Prize–winning Chicago School monetarist economist Milton Friedman wrote: &quot;Stossel is that rare creature, a TV commentator who understands economics, in all its subtlety.&quot; Steve Forbes, the editor of &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, described Stossel as &quot;one of America&#x27;s ablest and most courageous journalists.&quot; The author P. J. O&#x27;Rourke said, &quot;He seeks the truths that destroy truisms, wields reason against all that&#x27;s unreasonable, and uses and upholds the ideals that puncture sanctimonious idealism&quot;.

An article published by the libertarian group Advocates for Self Government notes praise for Stossel. Independent Institute Research Analyst Anthony Gregory, writing on the libertarian blog LewRockwell.com, described Stossel as a &quot;heroic rogue... a media maverick and proponent of freedom in an otherwise statist, conformist mass media.&quot; Libertarian investment analyst Mark Skousen said Stossel is &quot;a true libertarian hero&quot;.

===Criticism and controversy===
Progressive organizations such as Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) and Media Matters for America (MMfA) have criticized Stossel&#x27;s work, for what they described as a lack of balance of coverage and distortion of facts on his part. For example, Stossel was criticized for a segment on his October 11, 1999, show during which he argued that AIDS research has received too much funding, &quot;25 times more than on Parkinson&#x27;s, which kills more people.&quot; FAIR pointed out that AIDS had in fact killed more people in the United States in 1999.

In a February 2000 &quot;Salon&quot; feature on Stossel titled &quot;Prime-time propagandist&quot;, David Mastio wrote that Stossel has a conflict of interest in donating profits from his public speaking engagements to, among others, a non-profit called &quot;Stossel in the Classroom&quot; which includes material for use in schools, some of which uses material made by Stossel.

University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith has alleged that Stossel, in his September 1999 special &quot;Is America #1?&quot;, used an out-of-context clip of Galbraith to convey the notion that Galbraith advocated the adoption by Europe of the free market economics practiced by the United States, when in fact Galbraith actually advocated that Europe adopt some of the United States&#x27; social benefit transfer mechanisms such as Social Security, which is the economically opposite view. Stossel denied any misrepresentation of Galbraith&#x27;s views and stated that it was not his intention to convey that Galbraith agreed with all of the special&#x27;s ideas. However, he re-edited that portion of the program for its September 2000 repeat, in which Stossel paraphrased, &quot;Even economists who like Europe&#x27;s policies, like James Galbraith, now acknowledge America&#x27;s success.&quot;

====David Schultz incident====
On December 28, 1984, during an interview for &quot;20/20&quot; on professional wrestling, wrestler David Schultz struck Stossel twice after Stossel said professional wrestling was &quot;fake&quot;, during a time when the professional wrestling industry heavily protected kayfabe. Stossel said he suffered from pain and buzzing in his ears eight weeks after the assault. Stossel sued and obtained a settlement of $425,000 from the World Wrestling Federation (WWF); the WWF would eventually admit to the industry having predetermined results in 1989. In his book, &quot;Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity&quot;, Stossel noted his regret, believing lawsuits harm innocent people. Schultz maintains that he attacked Stossel on orders from Vince McMahon, the head of the then-WWF. This was later re-visited on the second season episode of &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot;, aired on April 28, 2020.

====Organic vegetables====
A February 2000 story about organic vegetables on &quot;20/20&quot; included statements by Stossel that tests had shown that neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food was more likely to be contaminated by &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story&#x27;s producer backed Stossel&#x27;s statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; confirmed the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.

====Frederick K. C. Price====
In a March 2007 segment about finances and lifestyles of televangelists, &quot;20/20&quot; aired a segment by Stossel that included a clip of television minister Frederick K. C. Price, which had originally been broadcast by the Lifetime Network in 1997. Price alleged that the clip portrayed him describing his wealth in extravagant terms, when he was actually telling a parable about a rich man. ABC News twice aired a retraction and apologized for the error. The suit concluded with an out of court settlement including a public apology by ABC.

==== Lawsuit against fact-checkers ====
In September 2021, Stossel sued Facebook, alleging defamation for labels applied by fact checkers to two of his videos, but his lawsuit was dismissed in October 2022. The fact-checking organizations Science Feedback and Climate Feedback were also named as defendants in Stossel&#x27;s lawsuit. Stossel&#x27;s video titled &quot;Government Fueled Fires&quot; had been labeled on Facebook as &quot;missing context&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot;, and another video titled &quot;Are We Doomed?&quot; had been labeled as &quot;partly false&quot; and &quot;factual inaccuracies&quot;. Stossel&#x27;s lawsuit said that the labels harmed his viewership, advertisement revenue, and reputation, and that Facebook and its fact-checking partners &quot;falsely attributed to Stossel a claim he never made&quot;. In the first video, Stossel featured a guest who opined that climate change was not the primary cause of the 2020 California fires. In the second video, Stossel questioned statements made by those he refers to as &quot;environmental alarmists&quot;, including &quot;claims that hurricanes are getting stronger, that sea level rise poses a catastrophic threat, and that humans will be unable to cope with the fallout.&quot; A Facebook spokesperson called Stossel&#x27;s lawsuit &quot;without merit&quot;, and Facebook attorneys said in 2021 that &quot;The labels themselves are neither false nor defamatory; to the contrary, they constitute protected opinion.&quot; In October 2022, a federal court dismissed Stossel&#x27;s lawsuit, saying that Facebook did not defame him because the Facebook fact check program &quot;reflects a subjective judgment about the accuracy and reliability of assertions&quot;. The court also ruled that Stossel&#x27;s lawsuit could be dismissed under California&#x27;s anti-SLAPP statute.

==Personal life==
Stossel lives in New York City with his wife, Ellen Abrams and children, Lauren and Max. They also own a home in Massachusetts.

Stossel came to embrace his family&#x27;s Ashkenazi Jewish heritage after marrying his wife, who is also Jewish. They also raised their children Jewish. Stossel identified himself as an agnostic in &quot;Skeptic or Believer&quot;, the December 16, 2010, episode of &quot;Stossel&quot;, explaining that he had no belief in God but was open to the possibility.

Stossel&#x27;s brother, Thomas P. Stossel, was a Harvard Medical School professor and co-director of the Hematology Division at Boston&#x27;s Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital. He has served on the advisory boards of pharmaceutical companies such as Merck and Pfizer. Stossel&#x27;s nephew is journalist and magazine editor Scott Stossel.

On April 20, 2016, Stossel announced he had lung cancer despite never having smoked, and that as a result of its early detection, he would have a fifth of one of his lungs surgically removed.

<doc id="291593" wikidata="Q297285" url="?curid=291593" title="Ali Pasha of Ioannina">
<text>Ali Pasha (1740 – 24 January 1822), commonly known as Ali Pasha of Ioannina or Ali Pasha of Tepelena, was an Albanian ruler who served as Ottoman pasha of the Pashalik of Yanina, a large part of western Rumelia. Under his rule, it acquired a high degree of autonomy and even managed to stay &quot;de facto&quot; independent. The capital of the Pashalik was Ioannina, which, along with Tepelena, was Ali&#x27;s headquarters.

Conceiving his territory in increasingly independent terms, Ali Pasha&#x27;s correspondence and foreign Western correspondence frequently refer to the territories under Ali&#x27;s control as &quot;Albania.&quot; This, by Ali&#x27;s definition, included central and southern Albania, and parts of mainland Greece; in particular, most of the district of Epirus and the western parts of Thessaly and Macedonia. He managed to stretch his control over the sanjaks of Yanina, Delvina, Vlora and Berat, Elbasan, Ohrid and Monastir, Görice, and Tirhala. Ali was granted the Sanjak of Tirhala in 1787, and he delegated its government in 1788 to his second-born Veli Pasha, who also became Pasha of the Morea Eyalet in 1807. Ali&#x27;s eldest son, Muhtar Pasha, was granted the Sanjak of Karli-Eli and the Sanjak of Eğriboz in 1792, stretching for the first time Ali&#x27;s control down to Livadia and the Gulf of Corinth, except Attica. Muhtar Pasha also became governor of the Sanjak of Ohrid in 1796–7 and of the Sanjak of Vlora and Berat in 1810.

Ali first appears in historical accounts as the leader of a band of Albanian brigands who became involved in many confrontations with Ottoman state officials in Albania and Epirus. He joined the administrative-military apparatus of the Ottoman Empire, holding various posts until 1788, when he was appointed pasha, ruler of the Sanjak of Ioannina. His diplomatic and administrative skills, his interest in modernist ideas and concepts, his popular Muslim piety, his respect towards other religions, his suppression of banditry, his vengefulness and harshness in imposing law and order, and his looting practices towards persons and communities in order to increase his profits caused both the admiration and the criticism of his contemporaries, as well as an ongoing controversy among historians regarding his personality. As his influence grew, his involvement in Ottoman politics increased culminating in his active opposition to the ongoing Ottoman military reforms. He was one of the most prominent leaders. After being declared a rebel in 1820, he was captured and killed in 1822 at the age of 81 or 82, after a successful military campaign against his forces.

==Name==
Ali Pasha was variously referred to as Tepelena, Ioannina/Janina/Yannina, or the Lion of Yannina. His native name was , and he was referred to as or ; and in other local languages as ; or (Ali Pasha of Ioannina); and ().

==Ancestry and early life==
Ali Pasha was born into the Albanian &quot;Meçohysaj&quot; clan; they were Christian Albanians who converted to Islam in the Ottoman period. The family was attributed a legendary ancestry as descendants of a Mevlevi dervish named Nazif who migrated from Konya to Tepelene through Kütahya, and Ali himself would make similar claims to foreigners and Ottoman Turks in order to claim legitimacy to landholdings. 
Nonetheless, this tradition is unfounded, as Ali&#x27;s family was of local Albanian origin.
They had achieved some stature by the 17th century; Ali&#x27;s great-grandfather, Mustafa Yussuf from the Gjirokastër region, was a notable brigand, warrior and clan chieftain who eventually obtained the title of bey and possibly official recognition as the deputy governor of Tepelena. Ali&#x27;s grandfather, Muhtar Bey, was also a bandit chieftain who fought both for and against the Ottoman Turks. Muhtar had died during the 1716 siege of Corfu. Ali&#x27;s father, Veli Bey, was a local ruler of Tepelena. Through his grandfather, Murat of Këlcyrë, Ali Pasha was a descendant of Yakup Bey Muzaka.

Ali himself was born in Beçisht, although some claim that he was born in the adjacent town of Tepelena. Ali&#x27;s father, Veli Bey, was involved in a rivalry with his cousin, Islam Bey, who was also a local ruler. Islam Bey was appointed mutasarrıf of Delvinë in 1752, but Veli Bey managed to kill him and thereby succeed his cousin as mutasarrıf in 1762. Veli Bey was assassinated shortly after when Ali was ten, and Ali was brought up by his mother, Chamko (or Hanko/Hamko), who originally hailed from Konitsa.

Ali&#x27;s mother Hamko was forced to take control of Veli&#x27;s band in order to retain her family&#x27;s position. She was said to have poisoned Ali&#x27;s half-brother (along with the boy&#x27;s mother) in order to secure Ali&#x27;s inheritance. She had a great impact on Ali&#x27;s personality, and Ali deeply respected her. Hamko arranged a marriage between Ali and Emine, the daughter of the Kaplan Pasha of Gjirokastër. Eventually, the villages surrounding Tepelena formed a confederacy against Hamko and forced the woman and her family out of the town; she was later ambushed and defeated by the men of Hormovë and Kardhiq, two Christian and Muslim Albanian villages respectively. Hamko and Ali&#x27;s sister were captured by the men of Kardhiq, raped and then humiliated by being forced to walk through the streets with a man on her back. From then on, Hamko would instil a desire for revenge in Ali, who would avenge his mother by massacring the inhabitants of Kardhiq in his later years.

Ali would have two sons with Emine, the daughter of Kaplan Pasha of Gjirokastër. The first would be Muhtar Pasha, and the second would be Veli Pasha. Ali&#x27;s youngest son, Selim, would be born to a slave much later in 1802. Both of his sons with Emine would be married to the daughters of Ibrahim Pasha of Berat. When Ali gained power, Ali&#x27;s sister, Shainitza, was married off to Sulejman of Gjirokastër; Sulejman&#x27;s family came from Libohovë in Zagoria, where Ali built a fortified seraglio as his sister&#x27;s dowry. One claim suggests that she was first married to Sulejman&#x27;s brother, also called Ali, but he died or was murdered by Sulejman with Ali Pasha&#x27;s permission. Shainitza&#x27;s third son, Adem, would become the governor of Libohovë, and her daughter from her first marriage was married to Veli Bey of Këlcyrë.

==Rise==
In his early years, Ali distinguished himself as a bandit in the mountains. Ali&#x27;s growing reputation as a notorious bandit forced the Ottoman government to take action, and they authorised Ahmet Kurt Pasha of Berat to subdue him. He was eventually captured by Kurt, possibly twice but definitely in 1775 when it is known that Ali was actually employed in Kurt&#x27;s service, due to a hostility that had arisen between the two upon Kurt&#x27;s rejection of Ali&#x27;s offer to marry Kurt&#x27;s daughter, Miriem. Instead, Miriem would be married to Ibrahim Bey of Vlorë in 1765, and Ibrahim would later become Pasha of both Vlorë and Berat. As a result, Ibrahim and Ali also became rivals, and this rivalry continued until Ibrahim&#x27;s death. Ali affiliated himself with the Bektashian sect, although he was not particularly anti-Christian or self-consciously Muslim and showed no favouritism to either group as a ruler.

Venetian records indicate that Ali and his cousin, Islam Bey of Këlcyrë, were part of a force of 9,000 Muslim Albanians under Sulejman Çapari, the aga of Margariti, who were engaged in conflict with the Souliotes in 1772, and it is possible that Ali was also part of Ahmet Kurt Pasha&#x27;s force in 1775 during Kurt&#x27;s campaign against the Souliotes. The first military action in which Ali is confirmed to have participated in was Ahmet Kurt Pasha&#x27;s conflict with Mehmed Pasha Bushati in 1776; Ali and his cousin Islam distinguished themselves during the subsequent engagements around Kavajë and Tirana, but Ali fell out with Kurt over the division of the spoils of war and resumed his life of banditry. In 1778, Ahmet Kurt Pasha was disgraced and dismissed as a result of the schemes employed by Mehmed &#x27;Kalo&#x27; Pasha of Yanina, who then took over the Sanjak of Avlona. The guardianship of the mountain passes was bestowed upon a Turk from Thessaly known as &quot;Catalcali Haci Ali Pasha&quot;; the local Albanians did not like him, and so he appointed Ali Pasha – at this point &quot;Ali Bey&quot; – as his deputy to establish order amongst the Albanian brigands while Catalcali remained in his fortress in the distant Chalkis of Euboea.

With this new Ottoman administrative position, Ali eliminated the military and civil officials appointed by Kurt in favour of his own men, and established a network between the leaders of Albanian bands and the captains of armatoli. Albanian fighters that refused to serve Ali were relocated to the Morea, where they could continue their occupation of plundering. Ali&#x27;s new position also meant that he could orchestrate legitimate and illegitimate protection rackets that gave him enough resources to recruit mercenaries and set aside money for bribes. Around this time, Ali went to Missolonghi to collect a debt owed by Michaeles Avronites, a local sea captain who was originally from Cephallonia and therefore a Venetian subject. Ali arrived in the town with his Albanians as a show of force, and when he could not find Avronites, Ali seized a number of Venetian subjects, including the Venetian consul. They were released only after Missolonghi&#x27;s leaders declared that they would pay the debt themselves, and Ali took 500 barrels of merchandise bound for the Ionian Islands as a guarantee, although these barrels were never returned to the people of Missolonghi. Similar intimidation tactics were used across Epirus by Ali, who although serving in this administrative position for only five months, managed to impose order and a systemic tax regime, as well as amass enormous personal wealth.

===Rivalry with Ahmet Kurt Pasha===
In 1779, Ahmet Kurt Pasha had returned to power through intrigue and bribery of the Sublime Porte. Ali openly challenged Kurt in an effort to get the Porte to recognise that Ali had a stronger power-base. Ali marched an army of 2,000–3,000 Albanians through Thessaly, dispersing them along the journey to intimidate local towns and villages and to extract wealth from them. At Trikkala, Ali led his own detachment of 300 soldiers into the near-deserted town as many of the inhabitants had already fled upon his approach. Once a certain amount of protection money was peacefully extracted from the town, Ali and his men left and proceeded to Farsala, where he and Catalcali Haci (who was still Ali&#x27;s superior) plotted against Ahmet Kurt Pasha.

Ali&#x27;s first action was to take the district of Acarnania, where his soldiers had already visited Missolonghi and yet again extracted more tributes from the citizens. Ali arrived with 4,000 men, occupying the regional capital of Vrachori (Agrinion) and re-joining his Albanian troops that had returned from their ravaging of the Morea. In response, Kurt moved his troops southwards in Epirus and placed pressure upon the Venetians and the armatoles to restrict Ali&#x27;s approach. The Sublime Porte was forced to intervene in the situation, and Ottoman general Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha, who was already dispatched to dispose of the Albanian irregulars in the Morea, was instead sent to Macedonia and Thessaly to re-establish regional order. Gazi Hasan Pasha, although aided by local Turks, armatoles and Greek peasants, was not able to defeat and drive out the Albanians. However, he later succeeded in pacifying the Albanians in the Morea, but peace was only temporarily restored as the Albanians continued to pour into the region.

Meanwhile, Ali had returned to Tepelena to restore his family&#x27;s position and solidify his power base. Upon learning that the Sublime Porte refused to restore him in place of Ahmet Kurt Pasha, Ali ordered his tribal and feudal allies to attack Kurt&#x27;s local garrisons, ravaging the mountain districts between Tepelena and the outskirts of Yanina for the next two years. The Porte forced Kurt to directly challenge Ali&#x27;s disruption, and although Kurt could muster a force of 10,000 men and 100 cavalry, he would not be able to defeat Ali in the mountain passes and resorted to besieging Tepelena. Ali had no other option but to break through the siege and make way for Butrint, which Kurt interpreted as an attempt to return to the Morea. Ali&#x27;s escape caused concern throughout Greece, and Kurt responded by sending 6,000 soldiers to the Bay of Arta to cut Ali off from his southern route and to trap him next to the sea, distributing funds along the way to local chieftains. Ali also recruited his own allies, including his cousin Islam Bey of Këlcyrë, the son of Sulejman Çapari and aga of Margariti Hasan Çapari, and Demoglou of Konispol. These allies kept the pasha of Delvinë&#x27;s forces occupied while Ali continued further south towards Arta and Preveza. These manoeuvres alerted the Venetians, and the pashas of Trikkala and Euboea were asked to send their armies to aid Kurt. Ali, contrary to what Kurt expected, changed direction and marched towards Yanina, subduing and fortifying important villages along the way.

Kurt&#x27;s troops, under the command of his son-in-law Ibrahim Bey, were unable to defeat Ali, and this resulted in a stalemate. Ali eventually retreated to Tepelena, and Kurt attempted to impress the Sublime Porte by sending severed heads as evidence of Ali&#x27;s demise, but the unrest continued nonetheless. Through his actions, Ali was able to greatly undermine Kurt&#x27;s authority and garner enough attention from the Venetians to establish diplomatic relations with them. In 1783, Ali sent a declaration of friendship to the Venetian administration at Corfu at the risk of an accusation of treason. Expecting to receive the title of Pasha of two tails at any moment, Ali asked them to intercede at the Sublime Porte on his behalf to hasten the process. The Venetians followed through, and in return, Ali disrupted Mustafa Koka, the Pasha of Delvinë and a political opponent of the Venetians.

===Initial appointment===
The Sublime Porte was still heavily in debt to the Albanian fighters who put down the Greek revolt in the Morea in 1769–1770, with astronomical sums being owed in back pay. Ali&#x27;s high prestige amongst the Albanian fighters, as well as his satisfactory diplomatic solutions that normalised Venetian-Turkish relations, highlighted the fact that he was now the &quot;de facto&quot; force in the region, bypassing both Ahmet Kurt Pasha and Kara Mahmud Pasha of Shkodër. Ali was appointed &quot;mutasarrif&quot; of Ioannina at the end of 1784 or beginning of 1785 on the condition that he lead 1,000 troops on campaign, possibly as part of the military response to the Russian annexation of Crimea.

==Deposition and re-appointment==

Ali did not keep his promise to the Sublime Porte; instead of going on campaign for the Ottomans, Ali focused his attention on Hormovë as part of a greater effort to impose his rule over the villages and towns around Gjirokastër before eventually subjugating Gjirokastër itself. In an act of vengeance on the people of Hormovë for their part in the humiliation of his mother and sister, Ali would attack the village with over 1,000 men after lulling the town into a false sense of friendship. The men were killed, the women and children sold into slavery, and the leader of Hormovë was roasted alive on a spit above a fire. His actions intimidated the neighbouring villages into submission, earning him governorship of Ioannina soon thereafter.

Additionally, the region of Himarë was seen as a point of concern for the Sublime Porte due to its support and collaboration with the Russian Empire and Venice. Serving as the governor of Delvinë, Ali claimed jurisdiction of the region and organised a campaign in 1785. Himara held out, however, as Ali had other issues to tend to. He failed to establish secure rule over Ioannina and made enemies of the local Turkish and Greek communities, who protested to the Sublime Porte. He was dismissed from his position in favour of his rival, Kurt Pasha, and was called upon by the Sultan to campaign against Kara Mahmud Pasha Bushati of Shkodër, whose attempts at creating an independent state forced a response from the Ottomans. Ali was then sent on another campaign in the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792, in which he also secretly established contacts with the Russians. In reward for his services at Banat during this war, he was granted the Sanjak of Trikala in 1787, which was suffering from brigand raids. Ali&#x27;s success in the pacification of brigandage in Trikala earned him the role of supervisor of the tolls of &quot;Toskëria and Epirus&quot;.

In the meantime, Kurt Pasha had died and was succeeded by his ally in Berat, Ibrahim Pasha. The Porte awarded Ali with control of Ioannina, however, the accounts on how this occurred vary; some suggest that Ali surrounded Ioannina with his forces and presented a forged document from the Sultan without giving the Porte enough time to object, while others suggest that he gained enough support from the notables of Ioannina that they petitioned the Sultan for his appointment on his behalf. Whatever the case, the earliest known reference to Ali as the Pasha of Ioannina is dated to the 15th of March, 1788. In that same year, he delegated the title of &quot;Pasha of Trikala&quot; to his son, Veli.

===Early consolidation===

Ali Pasha secured his position by establishing relationships with influential people and rewarding his supporters and allies. He was soon appointed to the post of &quot;Dervendji-Pasha&quot;, and he began to further consolidate his power in Epirus. He married his sons to the daughters of Ibrahim Pasha in Berat in order to secure their alliance as well as the borders of his Pashalik.

During war-time, Ali Pasha could assemble an army of 50,000 Albanian men in a matter of two to three days and could double that number in two to three weeks. Leading these armed forces was Ali&#x27;s Supreme Council. The Commander-in-chief was the founder and financier, Ali Pasha. Council members included Muhtar Pasha, Veli Pasha, Celâleddin Bey, Abdullah Pashe Taushani and a number of his trusted men like Hasan Dervishi, Omar Vrioni, Meço Bono, Ago Myhyrdari, Thanasis Vagias, Veli Gega and Tahir Abazi.

Ali&#x27;s own perception of group identity derived from the ancient legacy of Albanian banditry along with the accompanying Albanian pseudo-nobility. Ali conceived an independent state that almost certainly would have been controlled by this Albanian military and aristocratic elite. As Pasha, Ali was supported by an exclusively Albanian military establishment, which included many people who had undertaken brigandage activities earlier in their life. Ali Pasha also used Albanian tribesmen to put down Greek rebellions in the Morea.

==Rule as Pasha==

As Pasha, Ali slowly laid the foundations for the creation of an almost independent state, which included a large part of Albania and mainland Greece. During his rule, the town of Ioannina developed into a major educational, cultural, political and economic hub. In order to achieve his goals, he allied with all religious and ethnic groups in his territory. At the same time, he did not hesitate to fiercely crush any opponent, and he also developed relations with European powers. By the time of his accession to the Pashalik of Yanina, several almost-independent Albanian and Greek towns of the region reversed their approach of hostility against the Ottoman rule and pledged their loyalty to Ali. Ali&#x27;s policy as ruler of Ioannina was mostly governed by expediency; he operated as a semi-independent despot and pragmatically allied himself with whoever offered the most advantage at the time. It was Ali Pasha and his Albanian soldiers and mercenaries who subdued the independent Souli.
At this point, Ali Pasha&#x27;s priority was to create a centralised governing system by neutralising the numerous disruptive factions vying for power in his Pashalik, including the klephts, armatoles, Christian notables, and Albanian beys and agas. For example, Ali replaced Greek armatoles from the territories under his control with almost exclusively Albanian armatoles. The discarded Greek armatoles became klephts and their subsequent anti-armatoloi activity was not only brigandage, but also a form of resistance against Ottoman rule. Ali also targeted wealthy Muslim landowners under the guise of bringing justice for the peasant population whilst increasing his own wealth.

In 1788, Ali&#x27;s troops completed the destruction of Moscopole, a once-prosperous cultural centre in south-eastern Albania that had been continuously raided by Albanian irregulars from 1769 onwards due to their pro-Russian stance and support of the Orlov Revolt. The Aromanian population of Moscopole was forced to flee from the region and find refuge in regions outside of Ali&#x27;s control, both in and out of the Ottoman Empire. Many Aromanians scattered throughout the Balkans, founding settlements such as Kruševo, but many also migrated to foreign countries, forming an Aromanian diaspora. The same campaign of persecution was launched towards Sarakatsani communities.

===Ali and the Souliotes: Initial campaigns===
At this point in time, the Souliotes, a Christian Albanian community whose lands were located in Ali&#x27;s Pashalik, would pay their taxes to their spahi in Ioannina, Bekir Bey. Ali preferred to take the taxes directly into his own hands, and Bekir was promptly imprisoned upon his rejection of Ali&#x27;s proposal. The Souliote confederacy posed a continuous threat to Ali&#x27;s Pashalik by constantly raiding and terrorising the surrounding villages. The Souliotes were incited against Ali by Russian Empress Catherine the Great, who after the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774, was acknowledged as the protector of all Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire. At the behest of the Russians, the Souliotes had reportedly gathered 2,200 men who were ready to take up arms against Ali Pasha, and in response, Ali immediately mobilised his forces. With a force of 3,000 men and aided by the Çapari family of Paramythia, Ali attacked Souli, but the assault failed with considerable losses even though a Russian support fleet never materialised to help the Souliotes. The Souliotes, encouraged by their success, joined forces with klephts from the Pindus and ravaged both Greek and Albanian villages throughout Acarnania.

After failing to defeat the Souliotes via direct assault, Ali took another approach. In 1792, Ali mustered 10,000 men to attack Gjirokastër in response to the town declining his imposition of a bey, but this was all part of an elaborate plan to lure the Souliotes from their mountains. Ali wrote a letter to the Souliote captains George Botsaris and Lambros Tzavelas, in which he feigned friendship and admiration whilst asking for their assistance. The Souliotes cautiously accepted, and Botsaris wrote that, although he could not muster enough followers to join Ali, Tzavelas would join his army with 70 men as a sign of friendship. This group was placed on the front lines before Ali had Tzavelas and his men seized, chained and sent to Ioannina, with some being killed on the spot.

Ali, aided by his son Muhtar, proceeded with his attack on Souli, but Botsaris was well-prepared with solid defensive positions. The 1,300 Souliote defenders retreated from their villages and were pushed to the inner mountains of Souli. Ali attempted to coerce Lambros into betraying the Souliotes through a variety of means, and Lambros finally agreed when Ali offered him his freedom and lordship of Souli, although Lambros&#x27; 12-year-old son Fotos was taken as a guarantee. Once he was safe, Lambros sent Ali a letter revealing that he did not intend to fulfil his side of the bargain, regardless of whether he had to sacrifice his son or not, and that he would continue fighting against Ali and his men. Ali&#x27;s men would fail to make further ground, and Ali would cut his losses by exchanging prisoners (including Fotos Tzavelas), paying ransoms and signing a truce. The 1792 attack ended in a Souliote victory, and in the negotiations, the Botsaris clan managed to become recognized by Ali Pasha as the lawful representative clan of Souli and George Botsaris as the one who would enforce the terms of peace among the Souliotes. Ali, however, would not forget this humiliation.

===Consolidation===
Despite his setback in Souli, Ali Pasha retained an influential standing in Constantinople. For example, Ali managed to use his influence to reverse the death penalty imposed on the Pasha of Negroponte after he pleaded to Ali for help. Although he had obtained his power through force in a lawless environment, it was crucial for Ali Pasha to maintain peace and stability to ensure that his coffers remained full. Ali would offer protection to towns and villages in return for their loyalty, thereby increasing his control over his expanding territories by appointing his representatives and negotiating appropriate terms and tax arrangements.

Correspondence from Ali&#x27;s subjects during this period make heavy use of flattering and obsequious phrases whilst Ali&#x27;s replies are terse and factual, reflecting the power dynamic between them; villagers often wrote to Ali with complaints about the Souliotes thieving their sheep or about raids from klephts, usually from neighbouring villages. The people of Kokosi in Thessaly wrote to Ali in 1794 on behalf of Platini Scourpi, Koffi and other villages, requesting the prolonged stay of one of Ali&#x27;s boluk-bashis (officers) with his men to continue protecting them from bandits. The villagers of Kato Soudena also offered to pay Ali Pasha so that they may be placed under his protection. Ali did not only provide protection from bandits, however, as he offered protection from the Sultan&#x27;s tax collectors as well, interfering with the collection and disposal of government tax revenue through the bribery of officials or the allocation of tax collecting duties to his family and supporters. In fact, the higher ranks of the Greek Orthodox Church colluded with Ali to the extent that bishops were willing to act as his tax collectors. By pledging their loyalty to Ali, communities could put themselves under his jurisdiction.

At times, Ali Pasha would pay to bring a community under his jurisdiction. Villages would even threaten to separate, such as in 1802 when the inhabitants of Chebelovo complained that Ali favoured their neighbours over them. Communities that were unhappy with Ali&#x27;s rule were able to appeal to the Ottoman kadi courts or the central government itself, so it was crucial that Ali maintained good standing with his connections in Constantinople since his position as dervendji-pasha was never totally secure. When one of Ali&#x27;s lobbyists in the Phanariot elite informed Ali that there was a rival bid for control of the passes in 1797, Ali was encouraged to make a higher offer to the treasury and to ameliorate relations with the local communities he collected taxes from, as their complaints could serve as a justification for the authorities granting control of the passes to his rival.

By 1798, Ali Pasha&#x27;s influence extended to Veroia. He was made governor of Thessaly in 1799 to clear the region of bandits, soon followed by all of Rumeli. Ali was able to extract taxes beyond the strictly-defined borders of his realm, as his power extended beyond the areas that were formally recognised as his. By 1803, several villages in the district of Florina were finalising the terms of their tax collection with Ali, and Ali&#x27;s tax-collecting powers would eventually extend as far north as Prilep by assuming fake identities as a tax-farmer.

The principal role of geography in the communal groups of his time were comprehended by Ali. He insisted that Ioannina, located in the Greek district of Epirus, was Albanian. He also considered the Albanian population who lived in the area not as immigrants but as indigenous people of the region. He tried to justify his plans on the territories under foreign protectorate on the Ionian coast also by insisting that they were part of &quot;Albania&quot; as well.

Language was a defining element of Ali&#x27;s identity, as well as of his government and the region he controlled in general. Ali&#x27;s native language was Albanian. His degree of proficiency in written Greek is debatable, but it is known that he was able to speak the language. Albanians and Greeks exchanging languages was quite common in the 18th century. Ioannina was located in a largely Greek-speaking area, and during the Ottoman rule the Albanian language has not been officially recognized. Albanian has become a fully written language with its own script only from the mid-19th century, while written Greek was a well established language within the Ottoman Empire. The formal bureaucratic language of the Empire was entirely replaced with Greek in the pashalik, and in Ali&#x27;s court diplomatic business was exclusively conducted in Greek as well as much of the formal correspondence. Ali also used the Greek script to write in Albanian and to transliterate Turkish in his personal correspondence. The usage of Greek, however, did not in any way make Ali Greek, just as his role as Ottoman appointee did not in any way make him Ottoman. He was first and foremost considered as an Albanian.

===Ali Pasha and the European powers===
The stability brought about by Ali Pasha&#x27;s reign allowed the regional centre of Ioannina to become more cosmopolitan, connecting Ali to an international network. As his fame grew, so to did the number of foreigners in his court. Ali wanted to establish a sea-power in the Mediterranean which would be a counterpart of that of the Dey of Algiers, Ahmed ben Ali. However, in order to gain a seaport on the Albanian coast, Ali Pasha had to deal with Venice, which controlled the ports and the Ionian straits. The Venetians had obtained an agreement from the Sublime Porte in 1788 that barred Turkish vessels from accessing these Venetian holdings, as well as banning Ottoman gun emplacements within a mile of the coast. These conditions obstructed trade in Epirus as well as Ali Pasha&#x27;s ambitions.

Significant geopolitical shifts occurred in the Europe prior to Ali Pasha challenging Venice. The Treaty of Jassy in 1792, which allowed Greeks to sail under the Russian flag, significantly boosted Greek shipping and trade with the Crimea. The French Revolution&#x27;s influence reached Ali&#x27;s domain, with the French becoming a powerful force in the area. French consul Esprit-Marie Cousinéry, a supporter of Greek independence, and de Lassale, the consul of Preveza, discussed the possibility of French support in Ali&#x27;s ambitions. Lassale&#x27;s mission included securing timber from Epirus for the French Navy, thereby offering arms and ammunition to Ali for subduing Suli and Himara.

By 1797, Venice fell to Napoleon, leading to the Treaty of Campo Formio, in which the Ionian Islands and neighbouring ports were transferred to France. These strategic locations, long coveted by Ali, were now under French control. Ali, using the alias &#x27;Mustafa&#x27;, allegedly held the governorship of Arta from 1796. The French established garrisons and a naval presence in the region, and were welcomed as liberators in places like Preveza. Napoleon&#x27;s growing influence and victories inspired many in Europe, including the subjugated populations who saw the French advances as a liberation march. This environment set the stage for Ali Pasha&#x27;s manoeuvres to strengthen his position, and he formed an alliance with Napoleon I of France, who had established François Pouqueville as his general consul in Ioannina, with the complete consent of the Ottoman Sultan Selim III. The French already had consuls at Arta and Preveza when Ali Pasha unsuccessfully tried to approach Louis XVI as a precautionary guarantee to protect him from his opponents in the Ottoman capital.

Likewise, the British government, which opened in 1769 for the first time a consulate in Arta, established a permanent consular representation by 1803 and appointed John Philip Morier as &quot;General Council in the Morea and Albania&quot;, centred in Ali Pasha&#x27;s capital, Ioannina. This probably represents the earliest official recognition of the name &quot;Albania&quot; by the British government.

====Cooperation with the French====

Ali Pasha navigated the changing political landscape as the French sought to undermine Venetian influence in the region. Professing animosity towards the Venetian aristocracy, Ali secretly communicated with Napoleon, then in northern Italy, despite the risk of treason as France and the Ottoman Empire edged towards war. The French, eager to counter the power of the Ottomans, assisted Ali in ending the independence of the Himariotes. Ali impressed the French, particularly General Antoine Gentili, with his admiration for Napoleon, and he even arranged a marriage between his alleged illegitimate daughter and a French adjutant general. In a clandestine meeting, Ali sought military assistance and naval access around Corfu.

Influenced by Ali&#x27;s charm and strategic considerations as well as Himara&#x27;s ties to the Neapolitan Army opposing Napoleon and the French, Gentili collaborated with Ali in a surprise attack on Nivicë in 1798, a town which at this point was the most prosperous on the coastal littoral Butrint and Vlorë. Gentili ferried Ali&#x27;s troops through the Ionian straits by night in contravention of the treaty between the Venetians and the Porte. Landing in the bay at Lukovë to the north, Ali&#x27;s troops outflanked the town, which is situated at the entrance to the narrow valley which leads into Himara from the landward side. Ali&#x27;s men attacked Nivica and Shën Vasili, the neighbouring village to the north, on Easter Sunday when the inhabitants were at prayer, taking the town and other villages and then reducing them to ruins. They ravaged as far north as Himara itself, and it was said that 6,000 unarmed civilians were slaughtered in the process (some by roasting alive and impalement) whilst the rest of the population were sent to Ali&#x27;s farms near Trikkala. Their land was then divided up and partitioned for cultivation by Ali&#x27;s subjects in Saranda. Ali left a small square fortress at Shën Vasili to guard the entrance to Himara and to watch over the remaining population of Nivica. This campaign led to the annexation of Himara, extending Ali&#x27;s control along the coast to Vlorë.

Concurrently, during the winter of 1797-1798, Ali dealt with regional conflicts at the request of the Ottomans, particularly against the rebel governor Osman Pazvantoğlu who had begun carving out his own polity centred around Vidin in modern Bulgaria. The Ottomans had already dispatched a force of 50,000-100,000 men under Küçük Hüseyin Pasha to crush the rebellion, and they sent for Ali&#x27;s help. Ali, reluctant to appear subservient to the Sultan particularly in the face of the French, had his subjects in Karpenisi write to the patriarch of Constantinople and inform him that they were in fear of banditry should Ali leave them unprotected. This failed, and Ali was forced to take to the field personally with a force of 20,000 Albanians, leaving Mukhtar in charge in Ioannina. Despite the eventual failure of the Ottoman campaign once Ali left the Ottoman army and the subsequent pardoning of Pazvantoğlu, Ali Pasha and his Albanians distinguished themselves during the fighting, earning Ali the title &quot;Aslan&quot; (&quot;the Lion&quot;) from the Porte.

However, Ali Pasha&#x27;s engagement in this campaign and the French&#x27;s anger over his actions against their ally Pazvantoğlu strained his relations with France. Ali, in turn, was also disappointed with the failure of French promises of support; aside from pledges of financial and military support, the French had even offered Ali Pasha the crown of Albania once they had taken the Morea, but it became increasingly clear that this was not going to occur. Indeed, British traveller Henry Holland reported in 1815 that during a personal conversation with Ali it apparently emerged that Napoleon, at a certain point, had promised Ali the position of King of Albania, but Holland also remarked that Ali was not convinced by the offer, because he distrusted the French. As such, Ali&#x27;s alliance with France continued to sour. Upon his return to Ioannina, Ali felt compelled to align with the Sultan&#x27;s efforts to expel the French from Epirus, marking a significant shift in his regional allegiances.

===Conflict with the French===
====Conquest of Preveza====

In June 1798, as the French advanced their ambitions in Ottoman-controlled Egypt, Ali Pasha was engaged in the siege of Vidin along the Danube. Despite being distant, Ali received reports from his son Mukhtar on the situation in Epirus. These reports detailed subversive activities by the French, particularly their efforts to incite revolt among the Souliotes through the distribution of leaflets and tricolour cockades. Recognizing the potential threat to his rule, Ali obtained special permission from the Sultan to return to Epirus to address these issues whilst maintaining diplomatic communications with the French as he still contemplated a strategic alliance with them. He purportedly offered to join forces with the French in exchange for control over the island of Santa Maura as well as former Venetian territories on the mainland, and the right to station a garrison on Corfu. However, General Louis François Jean Chabot, the commander-in-chief of the French forces on Corfu, rejected this proposal. By September 1798, with the declaration of war between the French and the Ottomans, Ali&#x27;s stance became clear.

Ali Pasha quickly assembled his forces, although historical accounts differ as to whether Ali secured a commission to confront the French through diplomatic channels in Constantinople or whether the Porte&#x27;s slow response led Ali to unilaterally mobilize over 20,000 troops against a potential French invasion. Ali did not wait for the French to act and strategically positioned his troops near Butrint, setting a trap for the French. He lured the French adjutant general Rose, who was temporarily in charge at Corfu, to a meeting near Igoumenitsa. Rose, wrongfully believing in Ali&#x27;s professed allegiance to the French, was taken prisoner, tortured, and sent to Ioannina in chains; the same tactic would be used on the French sub-lieutenant in Butrint.

In October 1798, after securing Butrint and Igoumenitsa, Ali&#x27;s troops attacked the coastal town of Preveza, which was defended by a small garrison of French soldiers, Souliote fighters, Ionian islanders and local pro-French Greeks. Ali&#x27;s campaign was made easier by his former enemy, the Albanian chieftain George Botsaris of Souli, who allowed Ali&#x27;s men passage through Souliote territory in exchange for a payment. The battle itself occurred on the 12th of October as Ali observed from a vantage point above Nicopolis in the same location where Roman Emperor Augustus had watched the Battle of Actium. Ali observed as his son Mukhtar lead a cavalry charge, and the hastily constructed French defences were soon overwhelmed by Ali&#x27;s superior forces, which aside from Albanians also included Greeks and Albanian Souliotes. The fall of Preveza was further aided by Metropolitan Ignatios of Arta, an agent of Ali, who effectively weakened the resolve of the Greek defenders through counter-propaganda.

When the town was finally conquered, a major slaughter occurred against the local people as retaliation for their resistance. Ali ordered the execution of 300 Greeks in front of him, and when a number of those who fled returned on the false promise of amnesty, 170 of them were executed. Survivors were marched to Ioannina bearing the severed and salted heads of their companions, and were subjected to jeers and abuse from the pro-Ottoman populace as they marched at the head of a grand procession organised by Ali Pasha for his victorious troops. The women and young girls were sold into slavery. Notable among the captured French was Louis-Auguste Camus de Richemont, the commander of the French engineers, who was spared due to Mukhtar&#x27;s admiration for his bravery. Along with other survivors, including the captured French grenadiers and officers, they were sent to Constantinople. There, they were imprisoned in the Yedikule Fortress.

The massacre at Preveza had far-reaching implications, influencing the rise of Greek nationalism and being remembered in songs and literature by figures such as Lord Byron. Preveza was left in ruins as the properties of the Greeks were seized by Ali and redistributed among his Albanians. The surviving population was displaced to the marshlands around the Ambracian Gulf, and the town&#x27;s population was estimated to have drastically fallen from 16,000 to 3,000 inhabitants. Nonetheless, Ali transformed Preveza into a naval base and one of his favoured residences, earning it the moniker &quot;Portsmouth of Albania.&quot;

====Corfu and the Ionian Islands====

After the conquest of Preveza, Ali Pasha shifted his focus to Vonica, located across the Ambracian Gulf. This time, the town capitulated without resistance, surrendering after the intervention of Archbishop Ignatios, who acted on Ali&#x27;s behalf. Ali then focused on Parga, a refuge for those fleeing Turkish rule and a longstanding irritant to Epirus&#x27; rulers. Ali extended an offer of autonomy to Parga, which the inhabitants resolutely declined, citing their commitment to liberty and opposition to tyranny. This resistance would become another thorn in Ali&#x27;s side. Meanwhile, Ali&#x27;s ambitions extended to Aetolia-Acarnania, southeast of Vonica. His attempts to exert influence there were initially thwarted by the Ottoman government, which granted the region as a royal domain to Mihrişah Valide Sultan, Sultan Selim III&#x27;s mother. This move forced Ali to retreat from direct confrontation with the Porte, despite his efforts to maintain favourable relations with Mihrişah and her associates.

Ali&#x27;s territorial aspirations also included Santa Maura, an Ionian island close to the mainland. However, international developments, particularly Napoleon&#x27;s Egyptian campaign, complicated his plans. After joining the Second Coalition against France, the Ottoman Empire side-lined Ali as a Russian-Turkish fleet moved to capture the Ionian Islands from the French. Ali&#x27;s attempts to negotiate control of the island were interrupted by the arrival of this fleet. Parga, seizing the opportunity, placed itself under Russian protection, further hindering Ali&#x27;s territorial ambitions. The Russo-Turkish forces eventually captured Corfu, ending French rule in the Ionian Islands. Ali and his sons contributed to the siege, albeit in a diversionary role, which nonetheless enhanced his reputation, reportedly earning commendation from Admiral Horatio Nelson. In 1800, the Ionian Islands were formed into the Septinsular Republic, a tributary state of the Ottoman Empire, with specific conditions to respect the islands&#x27; autonomy and religious freedom. The Russians would eventually place the republic under their de facto military occupation.

Despite the removal of foreign powers from the mainland, Ali faced limitations in exerting direct control over important ports. His attempts to dominate Parga were met with resistance, as the Pargians, aided by the Suliotes, preferred direct dealings with the Porte. This stalemate continued even after the Treaty of Amiens in 1802, which Britain and France briefly endorsed. The resumption of hostilities between Britain and France in 1803 saw Ali reaching out to the British Embassy for guidance, marking the beginning of official British contact with him. Ali&#x27;s aggressive actions against towns under French influence were rationalized by his hagiographer Haxhi Shehreti as efforts to suppress Greek insurrection on behalf of the Sultan. However, this justification seemed redundant, given that these towns were not under Turkish rule and were embroiled in a war with France, and the situation was further complicated by increasing Greek nationalist sentiment fuelled by French interference.

====The Defeat of the Souliotes====

The French aided the Souliotes by funnelling money and supplies through Parga, hoping to weaken the Ottoman Empire. In response, the Porte obliged Ali Pasha to eliminate the Souliote threat, and Ali proceeded by commencing a war of attrition with the help of the Çapari family of Margariti. Ali had learned from previous failures that direct assaults were futile, and so he blockaded Suli with a ring of 12 fortresses, with the one at Gliki controlling the only road into Suli. The slow construction of these fortresses was further complicated by Souliote sharpshooters, and an estimated third of Ali&#x27;s troops deserted.

Simultaneously, in 1802, Ali finally managed to take Delvinë after seven years of conflict which were said to have destroyed much of the surrounding settlements. This granted Ali control of Epirus from Arta to Tepelenë and Vlorë, with Suli being the only region that still held out against him. The Souliotes, however, had their own share of struggles; in 1800, the chieftain of the Souliotes, George Botsaris, received a large sum and the position of the armatolos of Tzoumerka, and so the Botsaris clan left Souli and settled in Vourgareli of Arta. This was the first time that a Souliot clan became part of the Ottoman political system. The departure of the Botsaris clan weakened Souli as they were a significant part of its force, and George also took valuable munitions from the Souliotes when he departed.

Fotos Tzavelas, son of Lambros, became the new leader of the Souliotes, who were running out of supplies whilst Ali Pasha&#x27;s army of 20,000 continuously received imperial supplies. Ali finally attacked in autumn of 1803, and in response, most of the Souliotes gathered at the stronghold of Kungi above the village of Suli with their supplies running increasingly low. Out of desperation, the Souliotes decided that those who wished to surrender would be allowed to do so, and Ali saw this as an opportunity to take the Souliote leaders hostage and expel the Souliotes from their stronghold. Ali&#x27;s son Veli arranged for the surrender of the Souliotes with their leader Fotos, but a faction of the Souliotes preferred death instead. This faction, led by a monk known as Last Judgement Samuel and with the knowledge of Fotos, waited for Ali&#x27;s troops to come and take the arsenal; once the soldiers had entered, the monk and his five collaborators set fire to the magazines and blew up the arsenal.

The Souliotes, numbering to 4,000 survivors, agreed to abandon Suli and left to find refuge in Parga and the Ionian Islands as their four villages were destroyed. Some, however, trusted in Veli and remained. The conquest of Souli subsequently gave rise to numerous legends and stories, such as the Dance of Zalongo, which is portrayed in a number of ways in different versions. The exiled Souliote men went into military service wherever they could, such as for the Russians, the French, the Ottomans or even Ali himself. Souliote men who were captured during the conquest were tortured to death and then impaled or burnt, whilst captured Souliote women and children were enslaved in harems.

Ali&#x27;s victory over the Souliotes affected the relationships of the local communities as Muslims and Christians in the region were generally on good terms. For example, Fotos Tzavelas was the blood brother of Islam Pronjo, the most powerful Albanian bey in Paramythia, and the Pronjo family was secretly passing information onto the Souliotes despite serving under Ali&#x27;s banner. Ali was aware of this, and after fabricating an alliance between the Pronjo family and his rival Ibrahim Pasha of Berat, he expelled the family from Paramythia and destroyed the settlement. Likewise, Ali confiscated the properties of the Çapari family in 1807, who then sought refuge in the Ionian Islands before joining the Albanian ruler Muhammad Ali Pasha who had taken control of Egypt. The Çapari family returned to their homes only after Ali&#x27;s death, resuming their positions as tax collectors and Chiflik holders. Additionally, Ali&#x27;s wife of at least thirty years, Emine, had died around this time. Ali&#x27;s third son, Selim, was born to one of Ali&#x27;s slaves at the end of 1802, indicating that his domestic matters were complicated.

===Ali as Beylerbey===
It is suggested that Ali Pasha received the title of Beylerbey of Rumelia as a reward for his conquest of Suli. However, whilst Ali was dealing with the Souliotes, the klephts continued their rampant banditry whilst Osman Pazvantoğlu resumed his raids along the Danube. By 1801, the constant threat of Muslim hajduks and Christian klephts forced Selim III to extend the dictatorial powers of the previous beylerbey - Hadji Mehmed Pasha - for another two years, with the Sultan eventually appointing Ali Pasha to take Hadji&#x27;s place on 28 January 1803.

Ali ordered the neighbouring pashas to gather their forces and amassed a vast army of 80,000 troops to be used as a show of force in areas rampant with banditry. He first toured the new territories in Macedonia that were now under his control and ordered that they be provided with food and money, saving the locals from making such expenses. He then proceeded to pacify and punish those who had caused unrest throughout Rumelia before camping outside the walls of Plovdiv in the spring of 1804, finally deciding to return home with the loot he had obtained from the bandits. When he returned to Ioannina, he met with John Philip Morier and discussed the possibility of Epirus becoming an independent state with the help of the British.

Nonetheless, the klephts near Ali&#x27;s realm continued their activities, and Ali used the current state of affairs to leverage more power from the Sultan. In 1806, a year after the death of Mihrişah, Ali finally managed to gain control of Karli-Eli. This meant that Ali&#x27;s realm encircled the southern Pindus mountains, where klephts such as Antonis Katsantonis operated. Although Russian propaganda had begun influencing the klephts and armatoloi, the ideals of national identity were not fully existent at this time. Prominent band captains like Nikotsaras and Demitrios Palaeopolos served Ali Pasha as armatoloi on numerous occasions, but Nikotsaras became a bandit after shooting a Turkish soldier and caused so much trouble in Thessaly that the authorities put a bounty on him. After taking a hiatus from banditry, Nikotsaras was forgiven by Ali, who reinstated him as one of his armatoloi, but Nikotsaras would join the Serbian Revolution soon after.

====Siege of Santa Maura====
With the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War in 1806, Ali decided to attack the Ionian Islands as a show of loyalty to the Sultan whilst using the war as a pretext to subjugate the coastal Epirote towns directly under the control of the Sublime Porte. Ali sent his son Veli Pasha to drive out the governor in Preveza and to subjugate Butrint, Igoumenitsa and Vonitsa, and he subsequently imposed his own system of governance and tax collection and confiscated properties in the cities.

Parga, however, opposed Ali&#x27;s advances yet again, this time with the support of a Russian garrison from Corfu. Ali demanded that the Russians give up the Souliotes who had taken refuge on the Ionian Islands along with the klephts from the Morea who had fled Veli&#x27;s attacks, such as Theodoros Kolokotronis, and when these demands were refused. Ali prepared to attack Santa Maura, the location of exile for many of the Greek captains and their men, and he was aided by the French due to his good relations with Napoleon Bonaparte. The defense of Santa Maura was organised by Ioannis Kapodistrias, who commanded a force of Greek volunteers and Russian troops, including a regiment of 3,000 irregular light riflemen that consisted of Himariotes, Souliotes, Albanians and Greeks. A stand-off between the two sides ensued as they engaged in skirmishes, and the siege was interrupted when Ali had to return to Ioannina with 1,600 men to meet with emissaries sent by the Sultan.

Ali&#x27;s efforts were thwarted by Napoleon&#x27;s victory against the Russians at the Battle of Friedland. This victory resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, in which the Russians placed the Ionian Islands, Butrint, Preveza, Vonitsa and Parga back under French protection. Ioannis Kapodistrias notified Ali of the new situation, to which Ali replied that the truce has nothing to do with him but that he would honour it as long as no armatoli were left on the mainland. As a result, Ali would keep Butrint, Vonitsa and Preveza, but Parga would be transferred over to French forces by the Russian garrison.

====Ali and the Klephts====
The klephts and the armatoli were pushed towards a common cause by the actions of Ali Pasha and the Ottoman authorities, and under French influence, this began to develop into a more idealistic plan for the future. In 1807, the captains of the bands of Santa Maura met together with other klephts who operated in Macedonia and the Pindus Mountains at the Evangelistria Monastery at Skiathos and swore an &#x27;Oath of Freedom&#x27;. They began to raid Ali&#x27;s holdings in Thessaly, but Nikotsaras - one of the main klephts in this group - was killed during one of these raids. Demitrios Palaeopolos and Thymios Vlachavas fought against Ali&#x27;s troops in the mountain passes, and the idea of a klepht revolt overthrowing Ali was considered a favourable turn of events by the senior Ottoman officials who were concerned with Ali&#x27;s increasing power.

In response, Ali&#x27;s son Mukhtar was sent with 4,000 soldiers to destroy the klephts in 1808. The klepht movement began to degenerate into brigandage, and they targeted both Greeks and Muslims indiscriminately as support for their cause disintegrated. With the aid of Ali&#x27;s informers and particularly the betrayal of a klepht called Deligiannis, the klepht band was captured in the Pindus Mountains on the road to Trikkala. Demitrios Palaeopolos and Thymios Vlachavas were imprisoned for two years before escaping to Constantinople, with Palaeopolos seeking asylum from the French and leaving for Moldavia. Vlachavas obtained a firman from the Sublime Porte to guarantee his protection and returned to Ioannina, where he met with Ali. As Vlachavas was leaving the room, Ali had him arrested, imprisoned and eventually Ioannina once he had obtained permission from the Porte. Vlachavas&#x27; remains, which were cut to pieces, were hung up on display in Ioannina, and Ali&#x27;s soldiers destroyed the Monastery of St. Dimitrios at Meteora where Vlachavas had sought refuge.

In 1809, one of Ali&#x27;s captains - Ago Myhyrdari - had finally captured the klepht Antonis Katsantonis, who had been weakened by smallpox. Katsatonis was tortured and executed in public by having his bones broken with a sledgehammer.

==Ali&#x27;s Growing Independence==

Ali Pasha&#x27;s realm became increasingly independent, and he had begun to employ agents throughout Europe to further his ambitions. Even though the Ottomans and the British were at odds, Ali maintained relations with Britain and shifted his allegiance towards them once the French received the Ionian Islands from the Russians. Ali had numerous meetings with William Martin Leake in November 1807, with the most important being held in secret on 12 November near Nicopolis. Ali had hoped that Britain would invade the Ionian Islands on his behalf, whereas Leake utilised Ali to reconcile Britain and the Porte. The French, however, continued to pressure Ali to hand over Butrint to them.

After Sultan Selim III was assassinated in 1808, a period of chaos ensured in which Ali occupied Attica by force. Meanwhile, Ali sent his sons, Mukhtar and Veli, to the war on the Danubian front. When Britain and the Ottomans agreed to the Treaty of the Dardanelles in 1809, Leake gifted Ali artillery and ammunition to be used against the French, and the British Navy began to occupy the islands. This prompted the klephts to begin revolting, and Theodoros Kolokotronis allied with an Albanian chief by the name of Ali Farmaki who had quarrelled with Ali&#x27;s son Veli. Kolokotronis wished to form a confederacy of Souliotes and other Albanian tribes under Hasan Çapari to overthrow Ali Pasha and his sons, and sought the aid of the French.

Napoleon sanctioned the planned rebellion, but the British arrived as funds were being collected and rebels were being recruited. Ali&#x27;s rival, Ibrahim Pasha of Berat, turned to the French and gathered a coalition of Ali&#x27;s enemies, including Mustafa Pasha of Delvinë, Pronio Aga of Paramythia, Hasan Çapari of Margariti, the Beys of Himara, the Aga of Konispoli and the Souliotes. This coalition began attacking Ali&#x27;s realm with support from French artillery, and Ali responded by bribing Ibrahim&#x27;s supporters with British support. Ali besieged Ibrahim Pasha in Berat with an 8,000-man army commanded by the Albanian captain Omer Bey Vrioni, and with the aid of British rockets, Berat finally fell after a year of skirmishing. Ibrahim retired to Vlorë, and Ali told the Porte that he had taken Berat in response to the revolts in upper Albania that were the result of Ibrahim&#x27;s inability to rule.

Aware that the Sultan was not pleased with his actions, Ali did not press on with his offensive and target Vlorë. Eventually, Sultan Mahmud II was forced to acknowledge Ali&#x27;s actions as the most suitable way to maintain order, and Ali quickly conquered Vlorë, stretching his dominion from Durrës in the north to Arta in the south. Ali also purchased the pitch mines between Berat and Vlorë from the Porte, which allowed him to begin exporting goods throughout the Mediterranean from Vlorë. Ali named his son Mukhtar as the new pasha of Berat, whilst the former pasha Ibrahim was imprisoned and eventually poisoned.

In 1809, Lord Byron together with John Cam Hobhouse visited Ali&#x27;s court in Tepelena and Ioannina in 1809. Byron recorded the encounter in his work &quot;Childe Harold&quot;. They travelled to Albania to see the country that was, until then, mostly unknown in Britain. Byron presented Albanians as a free people who lived in their state under their leader, Ali Pasha, described by Byron as a &quot;man of first abilities who governs the whole of Albania&quot;.

By 1811, the sanjaks of Ohrid, Elbasan, Gjirokastër and Delvinë were incorporated into Ali&#x27;s territory. The city of Gjirokastër itself quickly surrendered to Ali after a show of force that included artillery, and a number of Ali&#x27;s opponents were given up by the locals of Kardhiq, where Mustafa Pasha of Delvinë had sought refuge, in the false hopes that he would spare them. Mustafa Pasha, alongside the beys of Gjirokastër and Konispol, were imprisoned in Ioannina along with their followers and were eventually killed. Ali&#x27;s son Selim, who was only 10 years old at the time, was installed in Gjirokastër. Simultaneously, the Ottomans expected Ali and his sons to reinforce them with tens of thousands of soldiers to aid in their war with the Russians, but Ali, likely fearing that he would be imprisoned or killed by the Ottomans, refused and cited old age and illness as an excuse.

===Revenge on Kardhiq===
In 1811, Kardhiq had taken in some of Ali&#x27;s opponents, but Ali eventually convinced them to hand over their guests, which included Ibrahim Pasha of Berat and Mustafa Pasha of Delvina. Later, in that same year, the chieftains of Kardhiq played a prominent role in the rebellion against Ali Pasha, and the rebels managed to inflict a heavy defeat on Ali&#x27;s troops in October. However, after Gjirokastër surrendered to Ali, the inhabitants of Kardhiq soon found themselves isolated and without allies. Many years prior, when Ali was just a child, the inhabitants of Kardhiq captured Ali&#x27;s mother and sister, raped and then humiliated them by forcing his mother to walk through the streets with a man on her back; urged on by his sister, Ali exacted revenge on behalf of his family by marching on Kardhiq, which continued to resist him. Ali surrounded the town with an army of up to 15,000 men and began a long siege.

In December 1811, the men of Kardhiq offered to surrender on the condition that they be allowed to emigrate to Corfu; Ali refused, and the siege continued. On 21 February 1812, the village finally fell, with at least 300 defenders having been killed in the final assault. Ali personally supervised the selection of individuals - including women and children - who would either be imprisoned in Ioannina or enslaved elsewhere. On 15 March 1812, Ali rounded all of the men who he believed were connected to what happened to his family and herded these 700-800 captives into the courtyard of a large han, locking the gates and manning the surrounding walls with his men. On Ali&#x27;s signal, they opened fire, and all of the captives were massacred by Ali&#x27;s troops. This massacre was carried out by Thanasis Vagias, who had led the final assault on the citadel of Kardhiq. During the massacre, Ali spared the family of an imam from Kolonjë due to his friendship with the man; the family consisted of about 30 men who were allowed to continue sowing the fields until they were eventually permitted to return and repopulate the village.

Ali had also sent 36 prominent townspeople to Ioannina as prisoners, but they too were shot upon arrival. He also sent the hair that was harvested from the heads of the victims of Kardhiq to his sister so that she may stuff the cushions of her divan, and he proceeded to ravage and destroy nearby villages that he believed were connected to Kardhiq. Pleased by his deed, Ali installed a stone memorial at the site of the massacre warning all those who would dare to cross his family that they would suffer the same fate.

===Purchase of Parga===
In 1812, as Napoleon retreated from Russia, Ali Pasha saw an opportunity to seize Parga and sent his son Mukhtar, his nephew Daut Bey, Omer Vrioni, Agos Vasiaris and 6,000 men to lay siege to the island. After negotiations failed, Ali&#x27;s forces captured the outlying village of Agia, massacring and enslaving the population. Parga was then besieged by land and sea, although Daut Bey was killed during the attack and was subsequently buried in a mausoleum in full view of the castle of Parga. Ali built a fortress at Anthousa to continue his assault, but the Pargians aligned with the British for protection. On 22 March 1814, after a brief struggle, the local Pargians took control of the town on behalf of the British, causing the French garrison to retreat and a British garrison to replace them.

At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Britain gained control of the Ionian Islands, but Parga&#x27;s fate was left unresolved. Ali accused the Pargians of being a threat to the Ottoman Empire and sought the Sultan&#x27;s support to gain control. In 1817, after lengthy negotiations between the British and the Ottomans, Parga was ceded to Ali in exchange for the Ottomans renouncing their claims to the Ionian Islands. As part of the agreement, the British demanded that the Ottomans pay compensation to the inhabitants who wished to leave Parga, but the Ottomans - not inclined to make the payment - offered Parga to Ali should he be willing to pay. Most of the Pargians, numbering 3,000-4,000 people, chose to emigrate to Corfu in April 1819 as Ali paid £150,000 in compensation, leaving him to take control of an empty town in May of that year. Ali’s acquisition of Parga was his last triumph, but it left him ruling over a volatile region, as internal and external tensions within the empire threatened stability. In 1816, Ali married his favourite mistress, Kyra Vassiliki; she had come to Ali years beforehand when she was 12 in an attempt to plead for her father&#x27;s life, and after he was granted pardon, Kyra was introduced into his harem and was married to Ali years later.

==Rebellion and downfall==

After the Second Serbian Uprising resulted in the formation of a semi-independent state in 1817, Ottoman minister Halet Efendi brought the attention of Sultan Mahmud II () to Ali Pasha, whose unchecked power and growing independence posed a threat to the Sultan’s authority. Official complaints began in 1814 when Ali had been encroaching on the territory of the pasha of Salonika, from where his men had been collecting taxes since 1808 and causing issues with local agas. His actions, including the massacre at Kardhiq, worsened his standing with the Ottoman leadership. In an effort to safeguard his position, Ali attempted to secure support from various powers, including the Greeks and Russians, but his efforts appeared more desperate than strategic.

In 1820, Ali was declared an enemy of the Porte after allegations were made that he had sent assassins to kill his former ally, Ismail Pashabey, who had defected to Constantinople. Three Albanians were found and interrogated until admitting to being Ali&#x27;s assassins and were subsequently executed, although this whole situation was likely staged. Nonetheless, the pashaliks of Ioannina and Delvinë were to be confiscated from Ali and given to Ismail. Ali initially attempted to deflect the situation by continuing with his bribes and warning the Sultan of the Filiki Eteria, a Greek organisation that Ali hoped to use for his own ends. This failed, and Ali looked towards the disaffected subjects of the empire for help, such as the klephts, as well as both Britain and Russia. His plans to raise an army and rebel against the empire were overly ambitious, and his overtures to the British and Russian governments failed to yield the military assistance he sought.

In July 1820, the Sultan issued an ultimatum demanding Ali present himself in Constantinople within forty days and justify his actions. Ali failed to show, and the Ottoman forces began to mobilize under Ismail Pashabey, who was to assemble a large army of troops under the pashas of Shkodër and Larissa. Ali prepared to defend himself by fortifying strategic positions in the mountains under his captains Omer Vrioni and Odysseas Androutsos, while his sons and grandsons held key territories along the coast and further inland. Ali garrisoned himself in Ioannina with 8,000 soldiers. However, as the Ottoman army advanced, Ali&#x27;s allies began to waver. His sons eventually abandoned their positions, and the Ottomans, with the help of bribes and local support, captured key towns, including Berat and Preveza.

The Ottoman Army advanced from the south, joining a Turkish naval expedition from Constantinople, along with squadrons from Algeria and Egypt. The Ottoman forces gained control of the sea, defeating a Greek fleet and capturing one of Ali Pasha’s intermediaries, Spyros Kolovos, who was tortured to death. The loyalty of Ali&#x27;s men increasingly wavered as the strength of their opposition became clear, and even Ali&#x27;s sons ultimately abandoned their father&#x27;s cause on the promises of pardons or other pashaliks from the Sultan. Mukhtar surrendered Berat whilst Gjirokastër fell to the Ottomans, resulting in the capture of Ali&#x27;s third son Selim. Only Hussein Bey, Mukhtar&#x27;s second son, swore to die for his grandfather and continue the resistance. The Ottomans used bribes to undermine Ali’s troops and invited the Souliotes to return from exile in Corfu and retake their homeland. With the aid of the Souliotes, the Ottomans had captured Preveza from Veli, but Ali&#x27;s fort at Kiafa resisted their advances.

As the Ottomans continued to advance, Ali was visited for a second time by Colonel Charles Napier on behalf of the British, who encouraged him to spend money on fortifications and reorganise his army. Ali was initially reluctant to spend his money, but after Odysseas Androutsos retreated from Thermopylae and Omer Vrioni deserted to the Ottomans with 15,000 men, Ali made an offer of two million to Napier to help improve his defences, but it was already too late. Ali was surrounded and besieged in Ioannina by an Ottoman army of 25,000 in August 1820.

===The Beginning of the Greek War of Independence===
The discipline in the Ottoman army deteriorated over the winter as their supplies ran low, and the troops began to ravage the countryside around Ioannina. Both sides of the conflict used Albanian mercenaries and Greeks, and their loyalty was constantly shifting. Ali&#x27;s spies reported that the presence of the Souliotes within the Ottoman army was the cause of much discontent, and many agas and beys were threatening to desert the Ottoman force. When the Souliotes failed to take Kiafa on behalf of the Ottomans, they were withdrawn from the main body of troops outside of Ioannina and stationed in the most exposed positions with little support in the case of attack. On December 4, 1820, Ali and the Souliotes formed an anti-Ottoman coalition, to which the Souliotes contributed 3,000 soldiers. Ali Pasha gained the support of the Souliotes mainly because he offered to allow the return of the Souliotes to their land, and partly by appeal to their shared Albanian origin. The Souliotes left the Turkish camp for their homeland of Souli, where Ali&#x27;s commander willingly handed them the fortress of Kiafa. Initially, the coalition was successful and managed to control most of the region, but when the Muslim Albanian troops of Ali Pasha were informed of the beginning of the Greek revolts in the Morea, it was terminated.

Ismail Pashabey was replaced by the governor of the Morea, Hurshid Pasha, as commander of the Ottoman army due to his ineffectiveness. Both sides were now suffering from defections, and Hurshid became increasingly frustrated with the Albanians in his army, who wished to prolong the campaign so that they could continue receiving payment for their service. On 7 February 1821, Ali was lured into sallying out from Ioannina and suffered a severe defeat. Meanwhile, Alexandros Ypsilantis became the leader of the Filiki Eteria and decided to use the situation in Epirus as a diversion for an attempt at Greek independence. He ordered Theodoros Kolokotronis to encourage the klephts to unite with the Souliotes, and Hurshid&#x27;s absence from the Morea as the commander of the besieging forces in Ioannina made the situation ripe for revolt. In February, Ypsilantis hoped to ignite a pan-Balkan revolution with Russian support by leading an army of Greeks into Wallachia, but the Ottoman Turks still feared Ali Pasha more than a potential Greek uprising and continued to place most of their focus on him.

Even though the Peloponnese was in full revolt by March 1821, the Ottomans were still more concerned about Ali Pasha, which allowed the Greeks to consolidate their uprising. The Sultan supported the policy of his grand vizier, Halet Efendi, who ignored the Greeks and instead focused on discourage Muslims - particularly Ali&#x27;s Albanians - from cooperating with the klephts. In response to the revolt, Ali sent one of his trusted Greeks, Alexis Noutsos, as a representative to negotiate the establishment of an Albanian-Greek state under Ali&#x27;s rule with the rebels. Noutsos, however, did not return, and instead joined the revolution under Alexandros Mavrokordatos at Missolonghi.

With the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, Hurshid Pasha was forced to fight a war on two fronts, besieging Ali at Ioannina whilst simultaneously fighting the Greeks to the south. In September 1821, at Peta near Arta, the Greeks formed an alliance with the Souliotes and their fellow Albanian allies to help Ali on the condition that villages that were previously under his direct control were freed. This short-lived coalition with Greek revolutionary forces had effectively checked the power of the Sultan&#x27;s armies and threatened Hurshid Pasha&#x27;s rear. However, Alexandros Mavrokordatos, who feared that Ali might still come to an arrangement with the Ottomans, persuaded Markos Botsaris - the leader of the Souliotes - to abandon Ali&#x27;s cause and instead join his brother Kostas in fighting for the Greeks who were now besieging Arta. Ali Pasha&#x27;s former ally, Omer Vrioni, was sent to relieve Arta, and in an attempt to split the Greco-Albanian coalition, he informed the Albanians that Ali&#x27;s time was up and that the Greeks were only fighting for their own cause. Upon discovering that the Greeks lacked arms and ammunition and were destroying mosques, the Muslim Albanians deserted the coalition and joined Omer, whilst the Souliotes went back to Souli.

The longstanding siege at Ioannina had taken its toll on Ali&#x27;s supplies, prompting him to burn the town and retreat to the citadel in the north-eastern corner of Ioannina Castle in October with the remnants of his harem and a small garrison. In January, the Ottomans broke into the citadel after a winter of stalemate, where they found only 100 defenders. Ali retreated to his strongest tower and had his men place barrels of gunpowder in the basement where his treasures and powder magazine were kept should it become necessary to blow up the citadel. Ali Pasha accepted a request from the Ottomans to enter into negotiations, in which he demanded that he be allowed to see the Sultan in person. Hurshid Pasha promised to pass on his request to the Sultan and in the interim issued Ali with a safe pass signed by himself and the other pashas in the army. Hurshid Pasha also sent Ali a fake imperial firman (decree), instructing him to leave the citadel while his request for a full pardon was considered.

===Death===
Despite sensing that he was being deceived, Ali agreed to a truce and left the citadel with his wife, entourage and bodyguards and settled in the Monastery of St Panteleimon on the island in Lake Pamvotis, previously taken by the Ottoman army during the siege. However, by giving up his treasures to Hurshid, Ali was no longer in any position to bargain, and whether or not Hurshid was acting under orders from the Sultan or whether he was actually awaiting the Sultan&#x27;s decree is uncertain. Likewise, the circumstances surrounding Ali&#x27;s death are also confusing and unclear.

A few weeks later, Ali was visited by a group of pashas and senior officials. He suspected a trap but the meeting passed without incident. In one account, a few days later on January 24, 1822, the Ottoman boats returned after which a senior official called Kiose Mehmed Pasha disembarked, claiming that he had in his possession the Sultan&#x27;s firman for his execution. Ali told him to stay back until he had read the document, but the pasha ignored him and called for him to comply. Ali pulled out his pistol and fired at him, the Pasha returned fire while Kaftan Agas, Hurshid&#x27;s chief of his staff, managed to wound Ali in the arm with his sword. Ali&#x27;s bodyguards rushed to protect him and managed to pull him into the building. The resulting gunfight only ended when Ali was mortally wounded in the abdomen by a bullet. This caused his men to surrender. Ali was then beheaded. His last request to his chief bodyguard Thanasis Vagias was for his wife Kyra to be killed in order to prevent her falling into the hands of his enemies, but this was ignored.

In other accounts, it is believed that Hurshid sent troops to Ali on 5 February with instructions to either kill or arrest him. In the simplest version, Ali thought the troops had arrived to deliver the pardon, but when the arresting officers entered the room and demanded his head for the Sultan, Ali responded by opening fire. In the ensuing skirmish, he killed two soldiers and wounded another before being shot through the heart. In another version, it is said that after some discussion with the officer in charge, both men went out on the balcony. Ali made a low bow, and the officer stabbed him in the heart as he was off his guard. It is said that Ali either died immediately, or was still alive and crawled back into the room. The Turks, afraid to take him on, shot at him through the wooden floor and killed him. In yet another version, when the officer and his men arrived with the document, Ali realized that it was not a pardon. Both sides opened fire, and after a struggle in which he was wounded, Ali took refuge in a room upstairs before suffering a fatal blow when the soldiers fired shots up through the floorboards and wounded him in the groin. This final version, which was recorded at the monastery thirty years later, is the one most widely told today.

Whatever the case of Ali&#x27;s death, his head was posthumously cut off and shown to the remaining Albanian troops who stopped resisting only when they were promised their arrears in wages. The skin of Ali&#x27;s head was peeled off for transportation in the usual manner to be stuffed with straw and moistened for presentation. Ali&#x27;s head was then wrapped in a cloth, put on a silver platter and displayed though the streets and the homes of the notables of Ioannina to prove that the Ali was dead. The local archbishop was having dinner with friends when Hurshid&#x27;s bodyguards forced their way into the room and deposited the head on the dinner table and demanded money. After saying a prayer for Ali, the archbishop handed over a bag of gold coins. Ali Pasha&#x27;s headless corpse was buried with full honours in a mausoleum next to the Fethiye Mosque, which he shares with his first wife Emine. His head was sent to Constantinople, where it was displayed to the public on the gates of the Sultan&#x27;s palace alongside the heads of his three sons and grandson who were also executed. Ali&#x27;s head was buried with his deceased sons and grandson in the tombs outside the Selvyria gate in Constantinople.

==Religion==
Ali Pasha was born into a Bektashi Muslim family. The struggle for power and the political turmoils within the empire required for him to support non-Muslim or heterodox priests, beliefs, and orders, and especially the Orthodox Christian population which formed the majority of the population in the region he ruled.

Ali fostered religious activities by the local Greek population. One of the spiritual figures which influenced him was Saint Cosmas. Ali ordered and supervised the construction of a monastery dedicated to him near Berat. Ali Pasha maintained control over the Christian population but respected the monasteries and stayed on good terms with the upper clergy.

He strongly supported the Sufi orders, well-spread in Rumelia at the time. Ali was close to the dominant Sufi orders as the Naqshbandi, Halveti, Sâdîyye, or even Alevi. Specifically the famous Sufi shrines in Yanina and Parga were Naqshbandi. The order that was mostly supported by him was the Bektashis and he is accepted today to have been a Bektashi follower, initiated by Baba Shemin of Fushë-Krujë. Through his patronage, Bektashism spread in Thessaly, Epirus, South Albania, and in Kruja. Ali&#x27;s tomb headstone was capped by the crown () of the Bektashi order. Nasibi Tahir Babai, a Bektashi saint, is regarded as one of three spiritual advisers of Ali Pasha.

==Influences==
===On Albanians===
====Albanian autonomy====
Ali Pasha was among those Albanian military leaders who were at first awarded for their loyalty to the Ottoman Empire, and who however exploited the weakness of the Sublime Porte to exercise in northern and southern Albania their gathered military and political power. While they are clearly not described as champions of national fight aiming at an independent and united Albania, but regarded as political opportunists within the context of the Ottomam Empire, nevertheless these Albanian rulers established separate states by challenging the authority of the Sublime Porte, and Ali in particular also established foreign diplomatic relations with Napoleonic France and with Britain. British travellers who had met Ali Pasha noted that Ali described himself and the Albanians as friends of the British nation. Furthermore, Albanians were seen as living independently and without oppression by the Porte, meanwhile Ali Pasha was aiming to form some kind of alliance with the British government. Ali&#x27;s separatist initiative, by conceiving his territory in increasingly independent terms referring to it as &quot;Albania&quot;, eventually aiming at creating an independent Albanian–Greek state, revealed the vulnerability of Ottoman power. The Albanian rule of the Pashalik of Yanina as well as that of the Pashalik of Scutari caused the emergence of a sense of ethnic belonging among the Albanian people, which consequently led to an enduring hostility of Albanians against the Sublime Porte, also by seeking autonomy from its central power.

Ismail Qemali (1833–1919), the first head of the Albanian state, stated that in the case of Ali Pasha there was a sense of wasted opportunity: &quot;If Ali Pasha had been less a man of his time and better endowed with political forethought, he would himself have organized this coup in time, and Albania and Greece, with the whole of Thessaly and Macedonia, might have become an independent State and a kingdom of great importance.&quot;

====Albanian culture====
Albanian urban songs were performed in the outer courtyards of the Albanian pashaliks, including that of Ali Pasha. It has been suggested that the Albanian &quot;Korçare&quot; songs emerged in Ali pasha&#x27;s seraglio in Ioannina, and that they were probably composed by Muço, Ali&#x27;s court musician.

According to Pouqueville, Albanian tribal forms of social organizations disappeared with the dominion of Ali Pasha, and definitely ended in 1813. In the Pashalik of Yanina, in addition to the Sharia for Muslims and Canon for Christians, Ali Pasha enforced his own laws, allowing only in rare cases the usage of local Albanian tribal customary laws. After annexing Suli and Himara into his semi-independent state in 1798, he tried to organize the judiciary in every city and province according to the principle of social equality, enforcing his laws for the entire population, Muslims and Christians. To limit blood feud killings, Ali Pasha replaced blood feuds (Alb. &quot;gjakmarrje&quot;) with other punishments such as blood payment or expulsion or the death penalty. Ali Pasha also reached an agreement with the Kurveleshi population not to trespass their territories, which at that time were larger than the area they inhabit today. Continually since the 18th century, blood feuds and their consequences in Labëria have been limited principally by the councils of elders.

====Albanian nationalism====
Ali Pasha has been regarded by Albanian nationalists in subsequent times as a national hero who rose against Ottoman rule. Although Ali Pasha&#x27;s intent was not to build a nation state, the legacy left behind by him was utilized by the Albanian elite to construct their nationalist platform. After Ali Pasha&#x27;s death the base of Albanian nationalist activities and uprisings against the Ottoman Empire became northern Albania and Kosovo.

===On Greeks===
====Modern Greek Enlightenment====

Although Ali Pasha&#x27;s native language was Albanian he used Greek for all his courtly dealings, with the effect of linking, although inchoately, the ruling class with the predominantly Greek-speaking population of the territories where Ali&#x27;s rule stretched. As a consequence, a part of the local Greek population showed sympathy towards his rule. This also activated new educational opportunities, with businessmen of the Greek diaspora, subsidizing a number of new educational purposes.

Ioannina, was among the Greek cities that had already embraced the Age of Enlightenment. Education in Ioannina and its schools became renowned throughout the Greek world. Those schools were operating by prestigious staff among them philologist Athanasios Psalidas, major contributor to the modern Greek Enlightenment and Georgios Sakellarios. Ioannis Kolettis served as Ali&#x27;s son Muchtar personal physician and composed several scientific works. As such an academic elite emerged which also included members of Ali&#x27;s court. Many of these personalities took later prominent roles in the Greek War of Independence.

====Greek War of Independence====
=====Revolutionary preparations and Ali Pasha=====
Ali Pasha did not sympathize with Greek rebels. He campaigned in Macedonia to exterminate the &quot;klephts&quot; and &quot;armatoles&quot; of the region in 1805, eventually managing to reduce substantially their numbers. Intense anti-Ottoman guerriglia actions arose in Macedonia during the Russo–Turkish War in 1806–1812, which caused heavy losses of Ali&#x27;s Albanians against an army of &quot;armatoles&quot; and &quot;klephts&quot; at the Battle of Klinovo. The inhabitants of Parga displayed continuous support for Greek revolutionary activities and cooperated with the inhabitants of Souli against Ali Pasha. Coastal towns that were under French control, such as Parga and Preveza, were a source of increasing Greek nationalist sentiment encouraged through French interference.

In the context of the Greek War of Independence the idea of cooperation with Ali Pasha was not new among the Greeks. Leading officials of the Filiki Eteria were considering a possible conversion of Ali to Christianity and the outbreak of the revolution under his direction. Ali&#x27;s policy of exlcuding Turks from all positions of authority and replacing them with Greeks and Albanians had led many Greek advisors and military leaders that consider him of becoming the head of a Greek–Albanian kingdom. However, when Ali heard of the outbreak of the Greek revolt, and sent Alexis Noutsos to propose a collaboration between Albanians and Greeks with the aim at establishing an Albanian–Greek state under the sovereignty of Ali Pasha, the Greeks refused Ali&#x27;s proposal and Noutsos joined the Greek revolutionaries. Greek captains would sign in September 1821 a more limited agreement with Ali, but it was based on obvious mutual suspicion. Albanian agents advised Ali against an alliance with the Greeks because they were militarily useless. Their conclusion about the military ineffectiveness of the Greeks and &quot;klephts&quot; turned out to be true in subsequent events in the Macedonian front.

====Revolutionary preparations in Epirus====
The Filiki Etairia already had expanded widely in 1820 at the time when Ali Pasha was found in open conflict with the Sultan. Its leadership decided that the conditions for the outbreak of the revolution were ideal since the conflict between Ali Pasha and the Sultan caused great unrest in Epirus, west central Greece, west Macedonia and part of Thessaly. The Filiki Eteria exploited the specific conflict in order to gain the return of the Souliotes to Epirus and as a result to have Ottoman units removed from southern Greece and especially from the Peloponnese.

However, in Epirus the revolutionary outbreak was complex and difficult due to the concentration of Ottoman troops. Members of the Filiki Eteria, such as Ioannis Paparigopoulos, the Russian consul of Patras, convinced Ali that Russia would support him. The return of the exiled Souliotes to their homeland in Souli in December 1820 contributed to the creation of a revolutionary center in Epirus a fact that supported the developments for the upcoming Greek revolution in southern Greece. The collusions of Souliotes and Muslim Albanians for the defense of Ali Pasha, which led to a written agreement in January 15, and 1821 were in accordance with the positions of Alexandros Ypsilantis for the preparation of the Greek revolution. Ali Pasha&#x27;s cause was supported by Souliotes because Ali promised their return to Souli, and partly by appeal to their shared Albanian origins.

=====Coordinated &quot;Greek–Albanian&quot; operations=====
Alexandros Ypsilantis anticipated that Ali would provide resistance against the Sultan&#x27;s troops in Epirus. On January 29, 1821, Ypsilantis ordered that Greek forces should be dispatched to Epirus to join those of Ali Pasha, temporarily and ostensibly, until they managed to defeat the Ottomans there. In late March-early April 1821 Christoforos Perraivos under order by Ypsilantis urged the Souliotes to maintain their alliance with Ali Pasha, but to ignore the military priorities of the latter and concentrate to armed operations that would facilitate the spread of the revolutionary movement in Epirus. Perraivos also emphasized only to the prominent Souliots the objectives of the nation due to risk of being leaked to the Muslim Albanians since that would make the later to abandon any agreement.

A failure in the sector of Tzoumerka thwarted the plans of the Greek revolutionaries and Ali, however their operational capabilities in the area had not been diminished. The revolutionaries of the area of Arta under Gogos Bakolas resisted the Ottoman advance at Peta on July 15. Communication between the Souliote units with troops loyal to Ali Pasha as well as revolutionary leaders from Arta and Acarnania continued. Their alliance was ratified on September 1, 1821. Alexios Noutsos played a key role in this developments while the Greek revolutionary authorities of Acarnania, Aetolia and Morea agreed despite the distrust towards Ali Pasha. In the beginning of September, the regional alliance reached its climax, involving Muslim Albanian beys, Souliote chieftains and Greek armatoles, who pledged to defend Ali Pasha&#x27;s rebellion against the Ottoman army. Greek singnatories evidently had not real intention to fight for Ali Pasha&#x27;s cause, they rather agreed merely to exploit the opportunity this alliance offered them.

The immediate objective of the alliance was the capture of Arta, which was at that time under Ottoman control. Roughly four thousand armed men gathered to besiege Arta. The city was attacked by both Muslims and Christians, Albanians and Greeks who had united their forces to pillage the city, where an indiscriminate looting of churches, mosques, shops and stores was perpetrated. The lootings during the siege Arta were especially perpetrated by groups of Souliotes and Acarnanians. Ottoman troops did not intervene because they knew they were not the target. During this event some of the Greek bands plundered the homes of Christians and stole their possessions, even torturing people in boiling oil in order to extort information regarding the hiding places of their valuable belongings.

At the beginning of December 1821 the allied forces managed to capture a greater part of the city, however, instead of concentrating on the fall of the garrison they turned into widespread looting and the siege was weakened and finally ceased.

====Termination of common operations====
Around the same time, during the Ottoman siege of Ali Pasha&#x27;s forces in Ioannina, Muslim Albanian leaders were being informed about events in the Morea, which led them to start doubting about the allegiance of their Greeks allies. Indeed, visiting Mesolonghi in October to see the Greek actions, Tahir Abaxhi, a Muslim Albanian warlord and especially trusted man of Ali Pasha formerly serving as chief of Ali&#x27;s police troops, noticed that many Greeks were no longer fighting for Ali&#x27;s cause, as after Mesolonghi had declared for the revolution, the remaining Muslims were massacred, expelled, or enslaved. The local Greek armatole Dimitrios Makris had even ordered mass killing. Mosques were razed to the ground and desecrated, and Muslim gils were forcibly baptized. The disprespect of the alliance by the Greeks became even more clear when Elmaz Bey informed Abaxhi that on their way home from Tripolitsa, they found out that Greeks have strungled some of his soldiers. Hence, after all the evidence, Muslim Albanian leaders eventually broke with Christian Souliotes.

Abaxhi and other Muslim Albanian military personalities that had been previously loyal to Ali Pasha approached the Ottoman commander, Khursid Pasha, asking for and receiving his pardon, promising to support him to kill Ali Pasha and drive out the Greek revolutionaries.

This so-called Greek-Albanian alliance was finally dissolved and the Muslim allies of Ali Pasha as well as the warlords (oplarhichoi) of Acarnania switched sides and came to the Sultan&#x27;s camp. As a consequence Ali Pasha&#x27;s resistance had been broken and the fortress of Ioannina was captured easily in December 1821.

====Greek nationalism====
Ali&#x27;s separatist initiative, by conceiving his territory in increasingly independent terms referring to it as &quot;Albania&quot;, and eventually aiming at creating an independent Albanian-Greek state, reveal the vulnerability of Ottoman power and had direct effect on the development of Greek nationalism. Though his subject population was by vast majority Greek and noted for their nationalist sentiment there is little evidence that Ali conceived of his desire for independence in such terms. However, he believed that he could make use of the local Greek national sentiment to strengthen his own power and separatist tendencies.

==Legacy==

Albania&#x27;s rich archaeological heritage has been systematically explored since Ali&#x27;s rule in the early 19th century. The excavations were conducted in order to find treasures for Ali&#x27;s personal collection. Systematic investigations of the archaeological sites and monuments of the region have been undertaken by French consul-general François Pouqueville and British diplomat-colonel William Martin Leake, who were both introduced in Ali&#x27;s court.

Pouqoueville&#x27;s &quot;Histoire&quot; included a lengthy account of Ali Pasha, based on personal acquaintance and multiple conversations with Ali and several other personalities associated with him. Pouqueville in this work pointed out that Ali&#x27;s rule and rebellion against the Porte was a vital precondition for the Greek Revolution. While in no way a Greek Nationalist himself, Ali&#x27;s rule greatly weakened Ottoman control of Greece, and his death created a vacuum which was promptly filled by the Greek revolutionaries.
The former Monastery of Saint Pantaleon in which Ali Pasha was killed is today the Museum of Ali Pasha and Revolutionary Period, a popular tourist attraction. The holes made by the bullets can still be seen, and the monastery has dedicated to him a museum, which includes a number of his personal possessions. The museum also features caves that were inhabited by monks in the 15th century and that were used for shelter during World War II, as well as an exhibit dedicated to Kyra Frosini, one of 17 women that were executed by drowning by men following Ali Pasha&#x27;s orders.

A legend of Ali Pasha&#x27;s supposed hidden treasure remained unresolved.

All three of Ali&#x27;s sons were killed during his downfall but most of his grandchildren were not persecuted by the Ottoman state as they were too young at that time. His grandson Tepedelenlizade Ismail Rahmi Pasha (son of Veli Pasha) had a long career in the Ottoman administration and held twice the governorship of the areas which were ruled by Ali Pasha. He was made governor of the Janina vilayet in 1850 and governor of the Thessaly Eyalet in 1864. He also was Mutasarrif of Prizren (1868–1869) and for a brief period governor of Crete.

==Ali Pasha in literature==
According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot;, in Western literature, Ali Pasha became the personification of an &quot;oriental despot&quot;.

In the early 19th century, Ali&#x27;s personal balladeer, Haxhi Shekreti, composed the poem &quot;Alipashiad&quot;. The poem was written in Greek language, since the author considered it a more prestigious language in which to praise his master. Alipashiad bears the unusual feature of being written from the Muslim point of view of that time. It stretches to 15,000 15-syllable lines was written by his personal balladeer.

Ali is the title character of the 1828 German singspiel &quot;Ali Pascha von Janina&quot; by Albert Lortzing.

Ali Pasha&#x27;s deeds have inspired numerous Greek poems and plays where he is primarily portrayed as cruel tyrant. Events like the sacking and drowning of women – including Euphrosyne Vasileiou – by Ali&#x27;s orders in Ioannina became the main theme of poet Aristotelis Valaoritis. The poem &quot;The drowning of Frosyne&quot; Nikolaos Mavrommatis (1770–1817) was also dedicated to the same theme, as well as the theatrical play &quot;Eufrosyne&quot; (1876). Other works describe the scorched earth policy Ali undertook in Ioannina and the burning of the city.

In the novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, père, Ali Pasha&#x27;s downfall is revealed to have been brought about by French Army officer Fernand Mondego. Unaware of Mondego&#x27;s collusion with the Sultan&#x27;s forces, Pasha is described as having entrusted his wife, Kyra Vassiliki, and daughter, Haydée, to Mondego, who sells them into slavery. Mondego then personally murders Ali Pasha and returns to France with a fortune. The novel&#x27;s protagonist, Edmond Dantés, subsequently locates Haydée, buys her freedom, and helps her avenge her parents by testifying at Mondego&#x27;s court martial in Paris. Mondego, who is found guilty of &quot;felony, treason, and dishonor&quot;, is abandoned by his wife and son and later commits suicide. Having found peace, Dantès departs for the East to begin a new life with Haydée, who has declared her love for him.

Alexandre Dumas, &quot;père&quot; wrote a history, &quot;Ali Pacha&quot;, part of his eight-volume series &quot;Celebrated Crimes&quot; (1839–40).

Ali Pasha is also a major character in the 1854 Mór Jókai&#x27;s Hungarian novel &quot;Janicsárok végnapjai&quot; (&quot;The Last Days of the Janissaries&quot;), translated into English by R. Nisbet Bain, 1897, under the title &quot;The Lion of Janina&quot;.

Ali Pasha and Hursid Pasha are the main characters in Ismail Kadare&#x27;s historic novel &quot;The Traitor&#x27;s Niche&quot; (original title &quot;Kamarja e turpit&quot;).

Ali Pasha provokes the bey Mustapha (a fictional character) in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s 1981 &quot;The Ionian Mission&quot; to come out fighting on his own account, when the British navy is in the area seeking an ally to push the French off Corfu. The Turkish expert for the British Navy visits him to learn this tangled story, which puts Captain Aubrey out to sea to take Mustapha in battle.

Many of the conflicting versions about the origin of the &quot;Spoonmaker&#x27;s Diamond&quot;, a major treasure of the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, link it with Ali Pasha – though their historical authenticity is doubtful. 

Loretta Chase&#x27;s 1992 historical romance novel &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Daughter&quot; includes Ali Pasha and a possible revolt against him by a cousin, Ismal.

The best selling graphic novel &quot;Sons of Chaos&quot; written by Chris Jaymes published in the US by Penguin Random House in 2019 and in Greece by Kaktos Publishing in 2021 surrounds the story of Ali Pasha and his relationship with the Suliotes.

<text>Paris–Roubaix is a one-day professional bicycle road race in northern France, starting north of Paris and finishing in Roubaix, at the border with Belgium. It is one of cycling&#x27;s oldest races, and is one of the &#x27;Monuments&#x27; or classics of the European calendar, and contributes points towards the UCI World Ranking.

Paris–Roubaix is famous for rough terrain and cobblestones, or pavé (setts), being, with the Tour of Flanders, E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem, one of the cobbled classics. It has been called &quot;the Hell of the North&quot;, &quot;a Sunday in Hell&quot; (also the title of a film about the 1976 race), &quot;the Queen of the Classics&quot; or &quot;la Pascale&quot;: the &quot;Easter race&quot;. Since 1977, the winner of Paris–Roubaix has received a sett (cobble stone) as part of his prize.

The terrain has led to the development of specialised frames, wheels and tyres. Punctures and other mechanical problems are common and often influence the result. Despite the esteem of the race, some cyclists dismiss it because of its difficult conditions. The race has also seen several controversies, with winners disqualified.

From its beginning in 1896 until 1967, it started in Paris and ended in Roubaix; in 1966 the start moved to Chantilly; and since 1977 it has started in Compiègne, about north-east of the centre of Paris. Since 1943, the finish has for the most part taken place in the Roubaix Velodrome. The race is organised by the media group Amaury Sport Organisation annually in mid-April.

The course is maintained by &quot;Les Amis de Paris–Roubaix&quot;, a group of fans of the race formed in 1983. The &quot;forçats du pavé&quot; seek to keep the course safe for riders while maintaining its difficulty. Other than during the world wars and, in 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic (the April 2021 race was postponed to October), it has taken place every year from its inception.

==History==

Paris–Roubaix is one of the oldest races of professional road cycling. It was first run in 1896 and has stopped only for the two world wars and the COVID-19 pandemic. The race was created by two Roubaix textile manufacturers, Théodore Vienne (born 28 July 1864) and Maurice Perez. They had been behind the building of a velodrome on 46,000 square metres at the corner of the rue Verte and the route d&#x27;Hempempont, which opened on 9 June 1895.

Vienne and Perez held several meetings on the track, one including the first appearance in France by the American sprinter Major Taylor, and then looked for further ideas. In February 1896 they hit on the idea of holding a race from Paris to their track. This presented two problems. The first was that the biggest races started or ended in Paris and that Roubaix might be too provincial a destination. The second was that they could organize the start or finish but not both.

They spoke to Louis Minart, the editor of &quot;Le Vélo&quot;, the only French daily sports paper. Minart was enthusiastic but said the decision of whether the paper would organize the start and provide publicity belonged to the director, Paul Rousseau. Minart may also have suggested an indirect approach because the mill owners recommended their race not on its own merits, but as preparation for another. They wrote:

Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux–Paris is approaching and this great annual event which has done so much to promote cycling has given us an idea. What would you think of a training race which preceded Bordeaux–Paris by four weeks? The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280 km, so it would be child&#x27;s play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris. The finish would take place at the Roubaix vélodrome after several laps of the track. Everyone would be assured of an enthusiastic welcome as most of our citizens have never had the privilege of seeing the spectacle of a major road race and we count on enough friends to believe that Roubaix is truly a hospitable town. As prizes we already have subscribed to a first prize of 1,000 francs in the name of the Roubaix velodrome and we will be busy establishing a generous prize list which will be to the satisfaction of all. But for the moment, can we count on the patronage of &quot;Le Vélo&quot; and on your support for organising the start?

The proposed first prize represented seven months&#x27; wages for a miner at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;VoduNo 10/10/2004&quot;&gt;Voix du Nord, France, 10 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau was enthusiastic and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, to find a route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer — later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale – continued by bike. The wind blew, the rain fell and the temperature dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted after a day of riding on cobbles (setts). He swore he would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying it was dangerous to send a race the way he had just ridden. But that evening a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix changed his mind.

===Easter mystery===
Vienne and Perez scheduled their race for Easter Sunday. The Roman Catholic Church objected to it being held on the most sacred day of the liturgical year, suggesting that riders would not have time to attend mass and that spectators might not bother to attend either. Tracts were distributed in Roubaix decrying the venture.

What happened next is uncertain. Legend says that Vienne and Perez promised a mass would be said for the riders in a chapel 200m from the start, in the boulevard Maillot. This story is repeated by Pascal Sergent, the historian of the race, and by Pierre Chany, historian of the sport in general. Sergent goes as far as saying that Victor Breyer, who he says was there, said the service, scheduled for 4am, was cancelled because it was too early. Neither Chany nor Sergent mentions if the date of the race was subsequently changed; however, the first Paris–Roubaix (according to Sergent) was held on 19 April 1896, whereas Easter Sunday in 1896 occurred two weeks earlier, on 5 April.

The first Paris–Roubaix on Easter Sunday was the next year, 1897.

===The first race===

News of Breyer&#x27;s ride to Roubaix may have spread. Half those who entered did not turn up at the Brassérie de l&#x27;Espérance, the race headquarters at the start. Those who dropped out before the race began included Henri Desgrange, a prominent track rider who went on to organize the Tour de France. The starters did include Maurice Garin, who went on to win Desgrange&#x27;s first Tour and was the local hope in Roubaix because he and two brothers had opened a cycle shop in the boulevard de Paris the previous year.

Garin came third, 15 minutes behind Josef Fischer, the only German to have won the race until 2015. Only four finished within an hour of the winner. Garin would have come second had he not been knocked over by a crash between two tandems, one of them ridden by his pacers. Garin &quot;finished exhausted and Dr Butrille was obliged to attend the man who had been run over by two machines&quot;, said Sergent.

===The second race===

Garin won the following year, beating Dutchman Mathieu Cordang in the last two kilometres of the velodrome at Roubaix. Sergent said:

As the two champions appeared they were greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome&#x27;s cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.

A classic victory was within his grasp but he could almost feel his adversary&#x27;s breath on his neck. Somehow Garin held on to his lead of two metres, two little metres for a legendary victory. The stands exploded and the ovation united the two men. Garin exulted under the cheers of the crowd. Cordang cried bitter tears of disappointment.

===Hell of the North===
The race usually leaves riders caked in mud and grit, from the cobbled roads and rutted tracks of northern France&#x27;s former coal-mining region. However, this is not how this race earned the name &quot;l&#x27;enfer du Nord&quot;, or &quot;Hell of the North&quot;. The term was used to describe the route of the race after World War I. Organisers and journalists set off from Paris in 1919 to see how much of the route had survived four years of shelling and trench warfare. &quot;Procycling&quot; reported:

They knew little of the permanent effects of the war. Nine million had died and France lost more than any. But, as elsewhere, news was scant. Who even knew if there was still a road to Roubaix? If Roubaix was still there? The car of organisers and journalists made its way along the route those first riders had gone. And at first all looked well. There was destruction and there was poverty and there was a strange shortage of men. But France had survived. But then, as they neared the north, the air began to reek of broken drains, raw sewage and the stench of rotting cattle. Trees which had begun to look forward to spring became instead blackened, ragged stumps, their twisted branches pushed to the sky like the crippled arms of a dying man. Everywhere was mud. Nobody knows who first described it as &#x27;hell&#x27;, but there was no better word. And that&#x27;s how it appeared next day in the papers: that little party had seen &#x27;the hell of the north.&#x27;

The words in &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; were:

We enter into the centre of the battlefield. There&#x27;s not a tree, everything is flattened! Not a square metre that has not been hurled upside down. There&#x27;s one shell hole after another. The only things that stand out in this churned earth are the crosses with their ribbons in blue, white and red. It is hell! &#x27;

===History of the cobbles===

Seeking the challenge of racing on cobbles is relatively recent. It began at the same time in Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders, when widespread improvements to roads after the second world war brought realisation that the character of both races were changing. Until then the race had been over cobbles not because they were bad but because that was how roads were made. André Mahé, who won in 1949 (&quot;see below&quot; Controversies), said:

After the war, of course, the roads were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There&#x27;d be stretches of surfaced roads and often there&#x27;d be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you&#x27;d get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you&#x27;d go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they&#x27;d fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft in the rain and got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it&#x27;s all changed and you can&#x27;t compare then and now.

The coming of live television prompted mayors along the route to surface their cobbled roads for fear the rest of France would see them as backward and not invested in the region. Albert Bouvet, the organiser, said: &quot;If things don&#x27;t change, we&#x27;ll soon be calling it Paris–Valenciennes&quot;, reference to a flat race on good roads that often ends in a mass sprint. &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; said: &quot;The riders don&#x27;t deserve that.&quot; Its editor, Jacques Goddet, called Paris–Roubaix &quot;the last great madness of cycling.&quot; Bouvet and Jean-Claude Vallaeys formed Les Amis de Paris–Roubaix (&quot;see below&quot;). Its president, Alain Bernard, led enthusiasts to look for and sometimes maintain obscure cobbled paths. He said:


It was Alain Bernard who found one of the race&#x27;s most significant cobbled stretches, the Carrefour de l&#x27;Arbre. He was out on a Sunday ride, turned off the main road to see what was there and found the last bad cobbles before the finish. It is a bleak area with just a bar by the crossroads. Bernard said:
The Amis de Paris–Roubaix spend €10–15,000 a year on restoring and rebuilding cobbles. The Amis supply the sand and other material and the repairs are made as training by students from horticulture schools at Dunkirk, Lomme, Raismes and Douai. Each section costs €4–6,000, paid for equally by the Amis, the organisers and the local commune. Bernard said:

===Strategic places of historic races===
The strategic places where earlier races could be won or lost include Doullens Hill, Arras, Carvin and the Wattignies bend. Some sections of cobbles have deteriorated beyond the point of safety and repair or have been resurfaced and lost their significance. Other sections are excluded because the route of the race has moved east.

===Pacers===
Early races were run behind pacers, as were many competitions of the era. The first pacers were other cyclists, on bicycles or tandems. Cars and motorcycles were allowed to pace from 1898. The historian Fer Schroeders says:

In 1898, even cars and motorcycles were allowed to open the road for the competitors. In 1900, the race was within a hair&#x27;s breadth of disappearing, with only 19 riders at the start. The following year, the organisation therefore decided to allow help only from pacers on bicycles. And in 1910, help from pacers were stopped for good. An option which lifted Paris–Roubaix out of the background and pushed it, in terms of interest, ahead of the prestigious Bordeaux–Paris.

==Course==
Originally, the race was from Paris to Roubaix, but in 1966 the start moved to Chantilly, 50 km north, then in 1977 to Compiègne, 80 km north.
From Compiègne it now follows a 260 km winding route north to Roubaix, hitting the first cobbles after 100 km. During the last 150 km the cobbles extend more than 50 km. The race culminates with 750m on the smooth concrete of the large outdoor Vélodrome André-Pétrieux in Roubaix. The route is adjusted from year to year as older roads are resurfaced and the organisers seek more cobbles to maintain the character of the race — in 2005, for example, the race included 54.7 km of cobbles.

===The start===
The race has started at numerous places:
The opening kilometres (the &quot;départ fictif&quot;) have often been a rolling procession. Racing has started further into the ride (&quot;départ réel&quot;). The start of open racing has been at:
===Main cobbled sectors===
The organisers grade the cobbles by length, irregularity, the general condition and their position in the race.

====Troisvilles to Inchy====

This sector is now usually the first cobbled section, typically about 100 km into the race, and was first used 1987. It is the highest of all the cobbles at 136 m.

====Wallers Haveluy====
A 2.5 km sector named after Bernard Hinault, the 1981 winner, which also features frequently in the Quatre Jours de Dunkerque race. It starts at 31m and finishes at 34m. It begins with a gentle rise and finishes with a gentle fall.

====Trouée d&#x27;Arenberg====

The &quot;Trouée d&#x27;Arenberg&quot;, &quot;Tranchée d&#x27;Arenberg&quot;, (Trench of Arenberg), &quot;Trouee de Wallers Arenberg&quot;, has become the symbol of Paris–Roubaix. Officially &#x27;La Drève des Boules d&#x27;Herin&#x27;, the 2400m of cobbles were laid in the time of Napoleon I through the Raismes Forest-Saint-Amand-Wallers, close to Wallers and Valenciennes. () The road was proposed for Paris–Roubaix by former professional Jean Stablinski, who had worked in the mine under the woods of Arenberg. The mine closed in 1990 and the passage is now preserved. Although almost 100 km from Roubaix, the sector usually proves decisive and as Stablinski said,
A memorial to Stablinski stands at one end of the road.

Introduced in 1968, the passage was closed from 1974 to 1983 by the Office National des Fôrets. Until 1998 the entry to the Arenberg pavé was slightly downhill, leading to a sprint for best position. The route was reversed in 1999 to reduce the speed. This was as a result of Johan Museeuw&#x27;s crash in 1998 as World Cup leader, which resulted in gangrene so severe that amputation of his leg was considered. In 2005 the Trouée d&#x27;Arenberg was left out, organisers saying conditions had deteriorated beyond safety limits as abandoned mines had caused sections to subside. The regional and local councils spent €250,000 on adding 50 cm to restore the original width of three metres and the race continued using it. The Italian rider Filippo Pozzato said after trying the road after its repairs:
It&#x27;s the true definition of hell. It&#x27;s very dangerous, especially in the first kilometre when we enter it at more than 60kh. It&#x27;s unbelievable. The bike goes in all directions. It will be a real spectacle but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really necessary to impose it on us.

In 2001 a French rider, Philippe Gaumont, broke his femur after falling at the start of the Trouée when leading the peloton. He said:
What I went through, only I will ever know. My knee cap completely turned to the right, a ball of blood forming on my leg and the bone that broke, without being able to move my body. And the pain, a pain that I wouldn&#x27;t wish on anyone. The surgeon placed a big support [&quot;un gros matériel&quot;] in my leg, because the bone had moved so much. Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats [a minute of the heart], there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant my leg was full of blood. I&#x27;m just grateful that the artery was untouched.

Gaumont spent a month and a half in bed, unable to move, and was fitted with a 40 mm section fixed just above the knee and, to the head of the femur, with a 12 mm screw. So many fans have taken away cobbles as souvenirs that the Amis de Paris–Roubaix have had to replace them.

In 2024, a chicane was added prior to the entrance of the forest to slow the speed of riders and improve safety. Some criticised the decision, with Mathieu van der Poel stating &quot;Is this a joke?&quot;.

====Mons-en-Pévèle====
The second of three sectors usually graded as five star difficulty, this 3 km sector includes a 16m rise and 2 right-angled turns. It was first used in 1978 and, as of 2016, has been used every year since except 2001.

====Carrefour de l&#x27;Arbre====
Le Carrefour de l&#x27;Arbre (or Pavé de Luchin) is the last section of pavé of the hardest level of difficulty, five stars. The crossroads (&quot;carrefour&quot;) is on open land between Gruson and Camphin-en-Pévèle. The route departs westward from Camphin-en-Pévèle along the rue de Cysoing towards Camphin de l&#x27;Arbre. The first half is a series of corners, then along irregular pavé towards Luchin. The second half finishes at the Café de l&#x27;Arbre restaurant and has more even pavé. This 2.1 km sector has often proved decisive due to its proximity to Roubaix (15 km) and cumulative difficulty. In 2023, the Camphin-en-Pévèle sector was renamed after three time winner Eddy Merckx, who became the sixth rider to have a sector named after them.

====Roubaix, Espace Charles Crupelandt====

The final stretch of cobbles before the stadium is named after a local rider, Charles Crupelandt, who won in 1912 and 1914. The organiser of the Tour de France, Henri Desgrange, predicted he would win his race. Crupelandt then went to war and returned a hero, with the Croix de Guerre.

This 300 m sector was created for the centenary event in 1996 by laying a strip of smooth new cobbles down the centre of a wide street. Among the cobbles are plaques to every race winner, giving the road an official name of &#x27;Chemin des Géants,&#x27; [Road of the Giants].

===The finish===
The finish until 1914 was on the original track at Croix, where the Parc clinic now stands. There were then various finish points:

* 1896–1914: Rue Verte/route d&#x27;Hempempont, Croix, Roubaix
* 1919: avenue de Jussieu, Roubaix, behind the dairy
* 1920–1921: Stadium Jean Dubrulle, Roubaix
* 1922–1928: avenue des Villas (now the avenue Gustave Delory), Roubaix
* 1929: Stade Amédée Prouvost, Wattrelos
* 1930–1934: avenue des Villas, Roubaix
* 1935–1936: Flandres horse track, Marcq
* 1937–1939: avenue Gustave Delory (former avenue des Villas), Roubaix
* 1943–1985: Roubaix Velodrome
* 1986–1988: avenue des Nations-Unies
* 1989–present (April 2022): Roubaix Velodrome

The race moved to the current stadium in 1943, and there it has stayed with the exceptions of 1986, 1987 and 1988 when the finish was in the avenue des Nations-Unies, outside the offices of La Redoute, the mail-order company which sponsored the race.

The shower room inside the velodrome is distinctive for the open, three-sided, low-walled concrete stalls, each with a brass plaque to commemorate a winner. These include Peter Van Petegem, Eddy Merckx, Roger De Vlaeminck, Rik Van Looy and Fausto Coppi.

A commemorative plaque at 37 avenue Gustave Delory honours Émile Masson Jr., the last to win there.

==Bicycles==

Paris–Roubaix presents a technical challenge to riders, team personnel, and equipment. Special frames and wheels are often used. In the past, developments to cope with the demands of Paris–Roubaix have included the use of wider tires, cantilever brakes, and dual brake levers. More recently, manufacturers such as Specialized have developed new types of bike which are designed to cope with the demands on the cobbled classics: the best known being the Specialized Roubaix series, which has a longer wheelbase and is designed to offer the rider a more forgiving ride. Many teams disperse personnel along the course with spare wheels, equipment and bicycles to help in locations not accessible to the team car.

André Mahé, winner in 1948, said such specialisation is recent:

Riders have experimented, however. After the Second World War many tried wooden rims of the sort used at the start of cycle racing. Francesco Moser wrapped his handlebars with strips of foam in the 1970s. Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle and Greg LeMond experimented with suspension in their front forks in the 1990s.

Some top riders receive special frames to give more stability and comfort. Different materials make the ride more comfortable. Tom Boonen, using a Time frame with longer wheelbase for the first time, won the race in 2005 and has since continued to use a bike with a longer wheelbase. George Hincapie had a frame featuring a 2 mm elastomer insert at the top of the seat stays. The manufacturers claimed this took nearly all the shock out of the cobbles. Hincapie&#x27;s Trek bicycle fared less well in 2006: his aluminum steerer tube snapped with 46 km to go, the crash injuring his shoulder.

Canadian rider Steve Bauer had a frame built by Eddy Merckx Bicycles with extremely slack angles, to the extent of being semi-recumbent. It was not a success and was only used for one edition of the race.

The bicycle made for Peter Van Petegem in 2004 was a Time. The distance from bottom bracket to rear axle was 419 mm rather than his normal 403. The distance from the bottom bracket to the front hub was 605 mm instead of 600 mm. The depth of the front forks was 372 mm instead of 367.5 mm The forks were spaced to take 28 mm tyres. The sprockets were steel rather than alloy and the steerer column was cut 5 mm higher than usual to raise the handlebars if needed before the start.

The bad roads cause frequent punctures. A service fleet consisting of four motorcycles and four cars provides spares to riders regardless of team. Yves Hézard of Mavic the equipment company which provides the coverage, said:

Every year we change fewer wheels, because the wheels and tyres are getting better and better. We changed about 20 wheels today. Five years ago, it was much worse — we&#x27;d be changing about a hundred. Tyres are becoming much better than before. So, yes, our job is easier — except that the race generally goes faster now, so we&#x27;re under a bit more pressure. Every year, there&#x27;s new types of gears, new aluminium frames, new titanium frames, so it&#x27;s getting more complex for us to offer neutral service. We have a list in the car of who is riding Mavic or Shimano or Campagnolo; the moment someone gets a flat tyre we need to think of a lot of things at once. Is it a titanium frame or a carbon frame or a steel frame?

==Controversies==

===1907===
In 1907, Georges Passerieu broke away from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he could not outsprint them if they all finished together. He was chased all the way to Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.

===1930===
In 1930, Jean Maréchal finished 24 seconds ahead of Belgian Julien Vervaecke but was moved to second because, while Maréchal was trying to pass Vervaecke, the Belgian tumbled into a ditch. According to some, Maréchal hit the Belgian&#x27;s shoulder, causing his fall. Jacques Augendre, historian of the Tour de France, said Maréchal, who was 20, &quot;was riding as an individual for a little bike-maker, Colin, and he got to Roubaix alone. His happiness was short-lived. Arbitrarily accused of having provoked a fall by Julien Vervaecke, with whom he had broken away, he was disqualified without any sort of hearing. Important detail: Vervaecke belonged to the all-powerful Alcyon team, run by the no less powerful Ludovic Feuillet (:fr: Ludovic Feuillet) ...&quot;

===1934===
In 1934 Roger Lapébie was disqualified for changing bicycles. Second placed rider Gaston Rebry was awarded the victory once officials discovered that Lapébie&#x27;s bike was missing a race sticker.

===1936===
In 1936 the Belgian Romain Maes, appeared to win but judges declared Frenchman Georges Speicher the winner and Maes second. Shouting began in the stands and for a moment it looked as though fighting would start, but calm returned and the result was upheld. A Belgian may not have won but there were seven Belgians in the first ten.

===1949===
The result in 1949 took several months and two international conferences to sort out. André Mahé was first but his win was challenged because he took the wrong course. Mahé was in a break of three that reached Roubaix velodrome in the lead, but he was misdirected by officials and entered the track by the wrong gate. Mahé was declared winner but a few minutes later other riders arrived using the correct route and Serse Coppi, brother of famous Fausto, won the sprint for what was assumed to be the minor placings. After a protest and several months, Serse Coppi was named joint winner with Mahé. Mahé said in 2007:

&quot;C&#x27;est trop bête d&#x27;en parler&quot; (It&#x27;s too stupid to talk about). There was a break. Coppi attacked. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I was going to win Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn&#x27;t like nowadays, when there&#x27;s television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like that at the end of Paris–Roubaix, when you&#x27;ve raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that&#x27;s the way I went.

It was a journalist on a motorbike who managed to get up to me. He was shouting &#x27;Not that way! Not that way!&#x27; And I turned round in the road and I rode back beneath the outside wall of the grandstand and I saw a gateway that went into the track, a gateway for journalists. And that&#x27;s the way I went, except that it came out on the other side of the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. But then his brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn&#x27;t ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be &quot;déclassé&quot;. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have a big victory. He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn&#x27;t dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about it. Never did. Why should I?

===1981===
In 1981 Bernard Hinault said after winning the race:
The only other times he rode it were in 1980, when he finished fourth, and in 1982, as the defending champion. When he was criticised, he said: &quot;I don&#x27;t go into offices and tell people to work harder, yet people ask me to be the strongest on the cobbles.&quot; Hinault fell seven times in that race, including 13 km from the finish when a small black dog called Gruson ran out in a bend and ran under his wheel. Hinault had been clear with Roger De Vlaeminck, Hennie Kuiper and Marc Demeyer. The incident made Hinault angry and he raced back to the others and won in Roubaix.

He was not the first star to refuse. Jacques Anquetil called it a lottery after puncturing 13 km from the end in 1958 and never took it seriously again.

In 2002 only two of the top 20 riders in the UCI table – Jens Voigt and Erik Zabel – were on the start line. The following year only Zabel was there. In 2004 he had stayed at home as well. Philippe Brunel wrote in &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;:

We won&#x27;t go as far as say that the five-time winner of the Tour [Hinault] – who every year gives the winner his celebration cobble stone on behalf of the organisers — has contributed to the impoverishment [&quot;paupérisation&quot;] of the queen of classics, which would offend him, but his words have contributed to the snub, or the indifference, of those who stay away. The fact isn&#x27;t new but the phenomenon is getting worse and is concerning. The peloton of stayaways has grown to the point where Paris–Roubaix is now only for a tight group of specialists... especially the Belgians, capable of maintaining high speed on the cobbles.

===1988===

The 1988 race contained a rare spectacle, for the first time in 30 years an early morning breakaway group held on until the finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders broke away and the pack did nothing to chase them down throughout the race. It was on a section of cobblestones outside Roubaix that Thomas Wegmüller (SUI) and Dirk Demol (BEL) broke away from the lead group to try for the victory. Wegmüller was ranked 175th in the world, Demol was a factory worker, ranked just inside the top 500 cyclists. As if the success of the breakaway wasn&#x27;t enough, Paris–Roubaix was about to deliver a cruel irony.

When the two entered Roubaix, Wegmüller ran over a plastic bag that flew out in front of him, which became jammed in his derailleur. Wegmüller was unable to change gears which was crucial for a sprint finish. Demol could have attacked at this moment and won the race with ease, but it was clear he did not want to win in this manner and drafted behind Wegmüller as he got assistance from his team car to remove the bag. They removed most of the bag, but some of it was still jammed and his gears still would not change. Knowing that a bicycle change would be suicidal to his chances, Wegmüller continued on his damaged bike; Demol continued to draft behind him. When it came down to the final sprint, Wegmüller could only watch as Demol easily sprinted ahead to take the victory.

Laurent Fignon finished third after a late breakaway from the chasing peloton. Sean Kelly, also part of the chase group containing the top riders in the world, crashed late in the race, after it was already decided the breakaway would not be caught and crossed the finish line with blood covering his face.

===2006===
In 2006 Leif Hoste, Peter Van Petegem and Vladimir Gusev were disqualified for riding through a closed railway level crossing 10 km before the finish and just ahead of an approaching freight train. Fabian Cancellara won and Tom Boonen and Alessandro Ballan were given the remaining places on the podium.


==Deaths==
In the 2018 race, Michael Goolaerts (Vérandas Willems–Crelan) crashed after suffering a cardiac arrest 100 km into the race. A doctor attempted to resuscitate him on the spot. He was flown to hospital in Lille by helicopter for treatment. At 23:30 local time, his death was announced by his team.

==Comments==

===Theo de Rooij===
The American television channel CBS covered Paris–Roubaix in the 1980s. Theo de Rooij, a Dutchman, had been in a promising position to win the 1985 race but had then crashed, losing his chance of winning. Covered in mud, he offered his thoughts on the race to CBS&#x27; John Tesh after the race:

&quot;It&#x27;s a bollocks, this race!&quot; said de Rooij. &quot;You&#x27;re working like an animal, you don&#x27;t have time to piss, you wet your pants. You&#x27;re riding in mud like this, you&#x27;re slipping ... it&#x27;s a pile of shit&quot;.

When then asked if he would start the race again, de Rooij replied:

&quot;Sure, it&#x27;s the most beautiful race in the world!&quot;Sean Kelly, a two-time winner of the event, one of the greatest Classics riders of all time, and a rider noted for his hardness and stoicism, referred on a number of occasions to his &#x27;love-hate&#x27; relationship with &#x27;the Hell of the North&#x27;;

&quot;A Paris–Roubaix without rain is not a true Paris–Roubaix. Throw in a little snow as well, it&#x27;s not serious.&quot; – Sean Kelly

&quot;Paris–Roubaix is a horrible race to ride but the most beautiful one to win.&quot; – Sean Kelly

===Other observations===
* &quot;Let me tell you, though — there&#x27;s a huge difference between the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix. They&#x27;re not even close to the same. In one, the cobbles are used every day by the cars, and kept up, and stuff like that. The other one — it&#x27;s completely different ... The best I could do would be to describe it like this — they plowed a dirt road, flew over it with a helicopter, and then just dropped a bunch of rocks out of the helicopter! That&#x27;s Paris–Roubaix. It&#x27;s that bad — it&#x27;s ridiculous.&quot; – Chris Horner

*&quot;This is a race that suits me when I&#x27;m having a good day. On the other hand, if you don&#x27;t have the legs, this is the worst place you could possibly be.&quot; – Jo Planckaert, 2004
*&quot;It&#x27;s a circus, and I don&#x27;t want to be one of the clowns.&quot; – Chris Boardman (speaking before the start on British Eurosport).
*&quot;Everybody has his own story during the race. When I get back to the bus I will hear the stories of my teammates and some stories come together and I start to understand what happened. It&#x27;s the beauty of the race.&quot; – Wout van Aert, 2022

==Les Amis de Paris–Roubaix==
Les Amis de Paris–Roubaix – the &quot;friends&quot; of the race – is an enthusiasts&#x27; group founded by Jean-Claude Vallaeys in 1983. It is based in France but open to members all over the world. It has its roots in the Paris–Roubaix Cyclo-Touriste of 1972. By 1982 there were 7,242 participants. There and at other events on the course, a petition calling for the cobbles to be saved gathered 10,000 signatures. Jean-Claude Valleys, Jean-François Pescheux and the Vélo-club de Roubaix, which Vallaeys founded in 1966, formed Les Amis de Paris–Roubaix in 1982 at a photo exhibition at the Maison du Nord-Pas de Calais in Paris.

Its aim was to find enough stretches of cobbled road to preserve the nature of the race. So many roads had been resurfaced that, as the organiser said, there was a risk that it would become a fast race on smooth roads won by sprinters rather than those who had fought through hell. Alain Bernard, who succeeded Vallaeys, says: &quot;We have succeeded in that. Today, the association looks after the maintenance of these paths of legend, working with local administrations to preserve them. But alongside that, we also do other things to preserve the value of the race, building up an impressive collection of documents, holding exhibitions, honouring former winners, holding tours of the route.&quot;

Les Amis said in 2007 that it was too late to save the sector of Bersée, which was removed from the race because of its dangerous state in 2007, but restored two years later. The situation is becoming critical, it says, at the Pont Gibus at Wallers, at Mons-en-Pévèle, Pont Thibaut at Ennevelin, the pavé of the Duclos-Lassalle section at Cysoing, and at Camphin-en-Pévèle.

&quot;Their disappearance would be a fatal blow to the Queen of Classics&quot;, says the association.

===&quot;Les forçats du pavé&quot;===

The weather is often bad for the riders; it is frequently worse for the &quot;forçats du pavé&quot; (literally &#x27;convicts of the cobbles&#x27;), as they call themselves In March 2008, &quot;Les Amis&quot; published an account of their work thus:

Saturday 22 March: a cold wind sweeps the plain of Pévèle; alternating showers of hail, melted snow and cold rain. Not a day to venture outside... Nevertheless, at the foot of the Mons-en-Pévèle ridge, silhouettes busy themselves along the soaked cobble roadway. Backs bent against the gusts, they tirelessly scratch at the ground with primitive tools. Who are these dozen souls — A work-gang from a byegone era? Automatons? Treasure-hunters?
No, these are members of the &quot;Amis de Paris Roubaix&quot;, trying to clean off the mud and crusted earth left on the cobbles by farm work. They are on an important section of Paris–Roubaix and, without their intervention, the greatest of cycling classics, due to be held in only a few days, will not be able to come through... And without these cobbled routes, the Paris–Roubaix would disappear, depriving the whole world of one of sport&#x27;s most intense and gripping events. This they know, and they&#x27;ll be back again the two weekends before the race, far from the media and officials who will soon bustle here.
The passion that drives them is much stronger than the bad weather. It has nothing to do with the current storms in the cycling world. These discreet servants of the &quot;Queen of the Classics&quot; have only one ambition — to clean the stones so that when the day comes for the champion to be crowned they can hold their cobbled trophy high.

==Other cobbled races==
Paris–Roubaix is sometimes compared to the other famous cobbled race, the Tour of Flanders in Belgium. Paris–Roubaix is flatter and has more difficult cobbles while the Tour of Flanders contains a series of hills, many on cobbles, like the Koppenberg or Kapelmuur.

In addition to Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders, called the &quot;cobbled classics&quot;, other spring races like Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and Gent–Wevelgem feature extensive cobbles.
==Related events==

The U23 Paris–Roubaix or Paris–Roubaix Espoirs is raced in the early summer.

The Paris–Roubaix Cyclo is organised by the Velo Club de Roubaix every other June. This allows amateurs to experience the cobbles, the finishing laps in the vélodrome, and the showers. There is a choice of three levels: 120 km, most of the cobbled sectors; 190 km all the cobbles; or the full 261 km. All finishers receive a small cobblestone on a wooden plinth.
The Paris–Roubaix Skoda Classic Challenge is organised the day before the pro race in April.

From 2021, Paris–Roubaix Femmes – a professional women&#x27;s race in the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour – has been held on Saturday, with the men&#x27;s race taking place on the Sunday. It follows the same terrain as the men&#x27;s race, albeit over a shorter distance.

In the United States, there are several examples of races or sportives over difficult or mixed terrain that are referred to by the name &quot;Roubaix&quot;, for example the Barry-Roubaix (which rhymes with Paris–Roubaix in French), the Rouge Roubaix, and the Brandywine Valley Roubaix.

<text>Drugstore Cowboy is a 1989 American crime drama film directed by the American filmmaker Gus Van Sant. Written by Van Sant and Daniel Yost and based on an autobiographical novel by James Fogle, the film stars Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch, Heather Graham and William S. Burroughs. It was Van Sant&#x27;s second film as director, following his 1988 debut &quot;Mala Noche.&quot;

At the time the film was made, the source novel by Fogle was unpublished. It was later published in 1990, by which time Fogle had been released from prison. Fogle, like the characters in his story, was a long-time drug user and dealer.

The film was theatrically released in the United States on October 6, 1989, and received acclaim from critics.

== Plot ==
In 1971, 26-year-old Bob Hughes leads a nomadic group of drug addicts—his wife Dianne, his best friend Rick, and Rick&#x27;s teenage girlfriend Nadine—who travel across the Pacific Northwest robbing pharmacies and hospitals to support their habits.

After stealing from a Portland, Oregon, pharmacy, they drive home to get high, and are visited by David, a local low-life seeking hard-to-find Dilaudid. Bob claims they have none, but offers to trade him morphine for speed. Initially reluctant, David is persuaded to trade and leaves. Later, police officers led by Detective Gentry, who correctly assumes the group is responsible for the pharmacy robbery, raid and wreck their apartment in an unsuccessful search for the stolen drugs, which Dianne has buried outside.

After moving to another apartment, Bob realizes that Gentry has the group under surveillance. Bob proceeds to devise an elaborate ruse which results in one of the policemen, Trousinski, being mistaken for a peeper by a neighbor who shoots and injures him. The next day, a furious Gentry assaults Bob. Believing a hex has been brought upon them, the group goes &quot;crossroading&quot; and robs a drugstore via an open transom. They find their haul includes vials of pure powdered Dilaudid worth thousands of dollars each. Declaring that &quot;when you&#x27;re hot, you&#x27;re hot,&quot; Bob convinces Dianne that he should rob a hospital.

During the robbery, Bob is almost captured, and the group returns to their motel to find Nadine has fatally overdosed on a stolen bottle of Dilaudid. According to Bob, she has also put &quot;the worst of all hexes&quot; on them by leaving a hat on her bed. After temporarily storing Nadine&#x27;s body in the motel&#x27;s attic, they are alerted by the motel manager that their room was previously booked for a sheriffs&#x27; convention, and they must check out. Bob, suffering tremendous anxiety and stress-induced visions of handcuffs and prison, sneaks the body out of the motel in a garment bag. Before burying Nadine in a forest, Bob tells Dianne that he is going to get clean and begin a 21-day methadone treatment program. Shocked by Bob&#x27;s decision, Dianne refuses to join him.

Bob moves into a long-stay motel in Portland and gets a low-level manufacturing job. At the methadone clinic, he encounters an elderly, drug-addicted priest named Tom, whom Bob remembers from his days as an altar boy. Gentry pays a visit to the motel and says that Trousinski has been making threats against Bob, whom Gentry encourages staying sober. Bob later witnesses David bullying a young man who supposedly owes him money. Bob intervenes and lets the man escape, much to David&#x27;s frustration.

One night, Dianne arrives at the motel and reveals that she is now in a relationship with Rick, the group&#x27;s new leader. Dianne asks Bob what happened on the road to make him change his life, and he answers that Nadine&#x27;s death, the hex she put on them, and the possibility of serious prison time contributed to his decision. He reveals a deal he made with a higher power: if he could get Nadine&#x27;s body out of the motel, past the cops, and into the ground, he would straighten out his life. Bob suggests Dianne stay the night with him, but she declines, and gives Bob a package of drugs before leaving. Bob gives the drugs to Tom (who rejects all of them except for a bottle of Dilaudid). Returning to his room, Bob is attacked by two masked figures, one of whom is David, who thinks he has drugs. Bob tells them that he is clean, but David does not believe this and shoots him. A neighbor phones for help, and Bob is loaded onto a stretcher. Asked who shot him, Bob tells Gentry it was &quot;the hat.&quot;

While riding in the ambulance, Bob concludes via a voice-over that he has &quot;paid his debt to the hat&quot; and so can return to his former lifestyle without breaking his commitment. He is amused by the perceived irony of the police driving him to a hospital — &quot;the fattest pharmacy in town.&quot;

== Cast ==
* Matt Dillon as Bob Hughes
* Kelly Lynch as Dianne Hughes
* James LeGros as Rick
* Heather Graham as Nadine
* Max Perlich as David
* James Remar as Gentry
* Grace Zabriskie as Mrs. Hughes
* William S. Burroughs as Father Tom Murphy

== Production ==
Tom Waits was Van Sant&#x27;s first choice to play the lead, although the finance company would not support Van Sant if he had cast him. Officially the reason given was that Waits was appearing in another movie they were financing, although Van Sant has said he suspected the Oscar win of &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman&quot;, a film they had also financed, had made them want a lead who could win an Oscar.

=== Filming locations ===
&quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; was filmed mainly around Portland, Oregon, including an area in the Pearl District that used to be a railyard, with a viaduct going over it. The Lovejoy Columns, which formerly held up the viaduct and feature outsider artwork, are featured in the movie. The initial drugstore scene was filmed at the Nob Hill Pharmacy on NW Glisan Street.

==Music==

The soundtrack includes songs that are contemporaneous with the film&#x27;s setting, along with original music by Elliot Goldenthal. It is one of his earliest works; in it, he does not use an orchestra, but a whole range of instruments treated in a synthesizer. The score and soundtrack were also the first that Goldenthal worked on with Richard Martinez, a music producer whose &quot;computer expertise and sound production assistance&quot; became the basis for frequent subsequent collaborations. &quot;AllMusic&quot; rated this soundtrack three stars out of five.

== Reception ==
The film was very well received critically and is listed on the Top Ten lists of both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, for films released in 1989. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 97% approval rating based on 29 reviews, with an average score of 8/10 and a consensus: &quot;&quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; takes us into a violent, transient world with cool, contemplative style&quot;. Review aggregator Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 82 based on 15 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

In his print review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Ebert gave the film 4 stars out of a possible 4. He described Dillon as offering &quot;one of the great recent American movie performances&quot; and highlighted how the film was successful by portraying the characters not as &quot;bad people [but] sick people&quot; who formed an unorthodox family to cope with &quot;the desperation in their lives&quot;. Ebert also singled out Burroughs&#x27;s cameo as &quot;a guest appearance by Death.&quot;

<doc id="291614" wikidata="Q1068118" url="?curid=291614" title="Fatou's lemma">
<text>In mathematics, Fatou&#x27;s lemma establishes an inequality relating the Lebesgue integral of the limit inferior of a sequence of functions to the limit inferior of integrals of these functions. The lemma is named after Pierre Fatou.

Fatou&#x27;s lemma can be used to prove the Fatou–Lebesgue theorem and Lebesgue&#x27;s dominated convergence theorem.

==Standard statement==
In what follows, formula_1 denotes the formula_2-algebra of Borel sets on formula_3.

)&lt;/math&gt;-measurable non-negative functions formula_4. Define the function formula_5 by formula_6 for every formula_7. Then formula_8 is formula_9-measurable, and
:formula_10
where the integrals and the Limit inferior may be infinite.}}

Fatou&#x27;s lemma remains true if its assumptions hold formula_11-almost everywhere. In other words, it is enough that there is a null set formula_12 such that the values formula_13 are non-negative for every formula_14 To see this, note that the integrals appearing in Fatou&#x27;s lemma are unchanged if we change each function on formula_12. 

===Proof===
Fatou&#x27;s lemma does &quot;not&quot; require the monotone convergence theorem, but the latter can be used to provide a quick and natural proof. A proof directly from the definitions of integrals is given further below. 

==== Via the Monotone Convergence Theorem ====

let formula_16. Then:
# the sequence formula_17 is pointwise non-decreasing at any and
# formula_18, formula_19.
Since 
:formula_20, 
and infima and suprema of measurable functions are measurable we see that formula_8 is measurable. 

By the Monotone Convergence Theorem and property (1), the sup and integral may be interchanged:
:formula_22
where the last step used property (2).

==== From &quot;first principles&quot; ====
To demonstrate that the monotone convergence theorem is not &quot;hidden&quot;, the proof below does not use any properties of Lebesgue integral except those established here and the fact that the functions formula_8 and formula_24 are measurable.

Denote by formula_25 the set of simple formula_26-measurable functions formula_27 such that formula_28 on formula_29.

&lt;/math&gt;}}

&lt;/math&gt;. 

For the reverse, suppose with formula_30 By the above, 
:formula_31 }}

Now we turn to the main theorem

)&lt;/math&gt;-measurable, for every formula_32, as is formula_8.}}




The proof is complete.

==Examples for strict inequality==
Equip the space formula_34 with the Borel σ-algebra and the Lebesgue measure.
* Example for a probability space: Let formula_35 denote the unit interval. For every natural number formula_36 define
::formula_37
* Example with uniform convergence: Let formula_34 denote the set of all real numbers. Define 
::formula_39

These sequences formula_40 converge on formula_34 pointwise (respectively uniformly) to the zero function (with zero integral), but every formula_42 has integral one.

==The role of non-negativity==
A suitable assumption concerning the negative parts of the sequence &quot;f&quot;1, &quot;f&quot;2, . . . of functions is necessary for Fatou&#x27;s lemma, as the following example shows. Let &quot;S&quot; denote the half line [0,∞) with the Borel σ-algebra and the Lebesgue measure. For every natural number &quot;n&quot; define
:formula_43
This sequence converges uniformly on &quot;S&quot; to the zero function and the limit, 0, is reached in a finite number of steps: for every &quot;x&quot; ≥ 0, if , then &quot;fn&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0. However, every function &quot;fn&quot; has integral −1. Contrary to Fatou&#x27;s lemma, this value is strictly less than the integral of the limit (0). 

As discussed in below, the problem is that there is no uniform integrable bound on the sequence from below, while 0 is the uniform bound from above.

==Reverse Fatou lemma==
Let &quot;f&quot;1, &quot;f&quot;2, . . . be a sequence of extended real-valued measurable functions defined on a measure space (&quot;S&quot;,&quot;Σ&quot;,&quot;μ&quot;). If there exists a non-negative integrable function &quot;g&quot; on &quot;S&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;&quot;n&quot; ≤ &quot;g&quot; for all &quot;n&quot;, then
:formula_44

Note: Here &quot;g integrable&quot; means that &quot;g&quot; is measurable and that formula_45.

===Sketch of proof===
We apply linearity of Lebesgue integral and Fatou&#x27;s lemma to the sequence formula_46 Since formula_47 this sequence is defined formula_11-almost everywhere and non-negative.
==Extensions and variations of Fatou&#x27;s lemma==

===Integrable lower bound===
Let formula_49 be a sequence of extended real-valued measurable functions defined on a measure space formula_50. If there exists an integrable function formula_51 on formula_34 such that formula_53 for all formula_36, then
:formula_55

====Proof====
Apply Fatou&#x27;s lemma to the non-negative sequence given by formula_56.

===Pointwise convergence===
If in the previous setting the sequence formula_49 converges pointwise to a function formula_8 formula_11-almost everywhere on formula_34, then
:formula_61

====Proof====
Note that formula_8 has to agree with the limit inferior of the functions formula_42 almost everywhere, and that the values of the integrand on a set of measure zero have no influence on the value of the integral.

===Convergence in measure===
The last assertion also holds, if the sequence formula_49 converges in measure to a function formula_8.

====Proof====
There exists a subsequence such that
:formula_66
Since this subsequence also converges in measure to formula_8, there exists a further subsequence, which converges pointwise to formula_8 almost everywhere, hence the previous variation of Fatou&#x27;s lemma is applicable to this subsubsequence.

===Fatou&#x27;s Lemma with Varying Measures===
In all of the above statements of Fatou&#x27;s Lemma, the integration was carried out with respect to a single fixed measure formula_11. Suppose that formula_70 is a sequence of measures on the measurable space formula_71 such that (see Convergence of measures)
:formula_72.
Then, with formula_42 non-negative integrable functions and formula_8 being their pointwise limit inferior, we have
:formula_75

==Fatou&#x27;s lemma for conditional expectations==
In probability theory, by a change of notation, the above versions of Fatou&#x27;s lemma are applicable to sequences of random variables &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, . . . defined on a probability space formula_76; the integrals turn into expectations. In addition, there is also a version for conditional expectations.

===Standard version===
Let &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, . . . be a sequence of non-negative random variables on a probability space formula_77 and let
formula_78 be a sub-σ-algebra. Then
:formula_79   almost surely.

Note: Conditional expectation for non-negative random variables is always well defined, finite expectation is not needed.

====Proof====
Besides a change of notation, the proof is very similar to the one for the standard version of Fatou&#x27;s lemma above, however the monotone convergence theorem for conditional expectations has to be applied.

Let &quot;X&quot; denote the limit inferior of the &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;. For every natural number &quot;k&quot; define pointwise the random variable
:formula_80
Then the sequence &quot;Y&quot;1, &quot;Y&quot;2, . . . is increasing and converges pointwise to &quot;X&quot;.
For &quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, we have &quot;Y&quot;&quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, so that
:formula_81   almost surely
by the monotonicity of conditional expectation, hence
:formula_82   almost surely,
because the countable union of the exceptional sets of probability zero is again a null set.
Using the definition of &quot;X&quot;, its representation as pointwise limit of the &quot;Y&quot;&quot;k&quot;, the monotone convergence theorem for conditional expectations, the last inequality, and the definition of the limit inferior, it follows that almost surely
:formula_83

===Extension to uniformly integrable negative parts===
Let &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, . . . be a sequence of random variables on a probability space formula_77 and let
formula_78 be a sub-σ-algebra. If the negative parts

:formula_86

are uniformly integrable with respect to the conditional expectation, in the sense that, for &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0 there exists a &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0 such that

:formula_87, 
then

:formula_79   almost surely.

Note: On the set where

:formula_89

satisfies

:formula_90

the left-hand side of the inequality is considered to be plus infinity. The conditional expectation of the limit inferior might not be well defined on this set, because the conditional expectation of the negative part might also be plus infinity.

====Proof====
Let &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0. Due to uniform integrability with respect to the conditional expectation, there exists a &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0 such that

:formula_91

Since

:formula_92

where &quot;x&quot;+ := max{&quot;x&quot;,0} denotes the positive part of a real &quot;x&quot;, monotonicity of conditional expectation (or the above convention) and the standard version of Fatou&#x27;s lemma for conditional expectations imply

:formula_93   almost surely.

Since

:formula_94

we have

:formula_95   almost surely,

hence

:formula_96   almost surely.

This implies the assertion.

<text>A cross compiler is a compiler capable of creating executable code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running. For example, a compiler that runs on a PC but generates code that runs on Android devices is a cross compiler.

A cross compiler is useful to compile code for multiple platforms from one development host. Direct compilation on the target platform might be infeasible, for example on embedded systems with limited computing resources.

Cross compilers are distinct from source-to-source compilers. A cross compiler is for cross-platform software generation of machine code, while a source-to-source compiler translates from one coding language to another in text code. Both are programming tools.

== Use ==
The fundamental use of a cross compiler is to separate the build environment from target environment. This is useful in several situations:
* Embedded computers where a device has highly limited resources. For example, a microwave oven will have an extremely small computer to read its keypad and door sensor, provide output to a digital display and speaker, and to control the microwave for cooking food. This computer is generally not powerful enough to run a compiler, a file system, or a development environment.
* Compiling for multiple machines. For example, a company may wish to support several different versions of an operating system or to support several different operating systems. By using a cross compiler, a single build environment can be set up to compile for each of these targets.
* Compiling on a server farm. Similar to compiling for multiple machines, a complicated build that involves many compile operations can be executed across any machine that is free, regardless of its underlying hardware or the operating system version that it is running.
* Bootstrapping to a new platform. When developing software for a new platform, or the emulator of a future platform, one uses a cross compiler to compile necessary tools such as the operating system and a native compiler.
* Compiling native code for emulators for older now-obsolete platforms like the Commodore 64 or Apple II by enthusiasts who use cross compilers that run on a current platform (such as Aztec C&#x27;s MS-DOS 6502 cross compilers running under Windows XP).

Use of virtual machines (such as Java&#x27;s JVM) resolves some of the reasons for which cross compilers were developed. The virtual machine paradigm allows the same compiler output to be used across multiple target systems, although this is not always ideal because virtual machines are often slower and the compiled program can only be run on computers with that virtual machine.

Typically the hardware architecture differs (e.g. coding a program destined for the MIPS architecture on an x86 computer) but cross-compilation is also usable when only the operating system environment differs, as when compiling a FreeBSD program under Linux, or even just the system library, as when compiling programs with uClibc on a glibc host.

== Canadian Cross ==
The Canadian Cross is a technique for building cross compilers for other machines, where the original machine is much slower or less convenient than the target. Given three machines A, B, and C, one uses machine A (e.g. running Windows XP on an IA-32 processor) to build a cross compiler that runs on machine B (e.g. running macOS on an x86-64 processor) to create executables for machine C (e.g. running Android on an ARM processor). The practical advantage in this example is that Machine A is slow but has a proprietary compiler, while Machine B is fast but has no compiler at all, and Machine C is impractically slow to be used for compilation.

When using the Canadian Cross with GCC, and as in this example, there may be four compilers involved
* The &quot;proprietary native Compiler for machine A (1)&quot; (e.g. compiler from Microsoft Visual Studio) is used to build the &quot;gcc native compiler for machine A (2)&quot;.
* The &quot;gcc native compiler for machine A (2)&quot; is used to build the &quot;gcc cross compiler from machine A to machine B (3)&quot;
* The &quot;gcc cross compiler from machine A to machine B (3)&quot; is used to build the &quot;gcc cross compiler from machine B to machine C (4)&quot;

The end-result cross compiler (4) will not be able to run on build machine A; instead it would run on machine B to compile an application into executable code that would then be copied to machine C and executed on machine C.

For instance, NetBSD provides a POSIX Unix shell script named codice_1 which will first build its own toolchain with the host&#x27;s compiler; this, in turn, will be used to build the cross compiler which will be used to build the whole system.

The term Canadian Cross came about because at the time that these issues were under discussion, Canada had three national political parties.

* 1979 – ALGOL 68C generated ZCODE; this aided porting the compiler and other ALGOL 68 applications to alternate platforms. To compile the ALGOL 68C compiler required about 120 KB of memory. With Z80 its 64 KB memory is too small to actually compile the compiler. So for the Z80 the compiler itself had to be cross compiled from the larger CAP capability computer or an IBM System/370 mainframe.

== GCC and cross compilation ==
GCC, a free software collection of compilers, can be set up to cross compile. It supports many platforms and languages.

GCC requires that a compiled copy of binutils is available for each targeted platform. Especially important is the GNU Assembler. Therefore, binutils first has to be compiled correctly with the switch codice_2 sent to the configure script. GCC also has to be configured with the same codice_3 option. GCC can then be run normally provided that the tools, which binutils creates, are available in the path, which can be done using the following (on UNIX-like operating systems with bash):

 PATH=/path/to/binutils/bin:${PATH} make

Cross-compiling GCC requires that a portion of the &quot;target platform&quot;&#x27;s C standard library be available on the &quot;host platform&quot;. The programmer may choose to compile the full C library, but this choice could be unreliable. The alternative is to use newlib, which is a small C library containing only the most essential components required to compile C source code. 

The GNU Autotools packages (i.e. autoconf, automake, and libtool) use the notion of a &quot;build platform&quot;, a &quot;host platform&quot;, and a &quot;target platform&quot;. The &quot;build platform&quot; is where the compiler is actually compiled. In most cases, build should be left undefined (it will default from host). The &quot;host platform&quot; is always where the output artifacts from the compiler will be executed whether the output is another compiler or not. The &quot;target platform&quot; is used when cross-compiling cross compilers, it represents what type of object code the package will produce; otherwise the &quot;target platform&quot; setting is irrelevant. For example, consider cross-compiling a video game that will run on a Dreamcast. The machine where the game is compiled is the &quot;build platform&quot; while the Dreamcast is the &quot;host platform&quot;. The names &quot;host&quot; and &quot;target&quot; are relative to the compiler being used and shifted like &quot;son&quot; and &quot;grandson&quot;.

Another method popularly used by embedded Linux developers involves the combination of GCC compilers with specialized sandboxes like Scratchbox and Scratchbox 2, or PRoot. These tools create a &quot;chrooted&quot; sandbox where the programmer can build up necessary tools, libc, and libraries without having to set extra paths. Facilities are also provided to &quot;deceive&quot; the runtime so that it &quot;believes&quot; it is actually running on the intended target CPU (such as an ARM architecture); this allows configuration scripts and the like to run without error. Scratchbox runs more slowly by comparison to &quot;non-chrooted&quot; methods, and most tools that are on the host must be moved into Scratchbox to function.

== Manx Aztec C cross compilers ==
Manx Software Systems, of Shrewsbury, New Jersey, produced C compilers beginning in the 1980s targeted at professional developers for a variety of platforms up to and including IBM PC compatibles and Macs.

Manx&#x27;s Aztec C programming language was available for a variety of platforms including MS-DOS, Apple II, DOS 3.3 and ProDOS, Commodore 64, Mac 68k and Amiga.

From the 1980s and continuing throughout the 1990s until Manx Software Systems disappeared, the MS-DOS version of Aztec C was offered both as a native mode compiler or as a cross compiler for other platforms with different processors including the Commodore 64 and Apple II. Internet distributions still exist for Aztec C including their MS-DOS based cross compilers. They are still in use today.

Manx&#x27;s Aztec C86, their native mode 8086 MS-DOS compiler, was also a cross compiler. Although it did not compile code for a different processor like their Aztec C65 6502 cross compilers for the Commodore 64 and Apple II, it created binary executables for then-legacy operating systems for the 16-bit 8086 family of processors.

When the IBM PC was first introduced it was available with a choice of operating systems, CP/M-86 and PC DOS being two of them. Aztec C86 was provided with link libraries for generating code for both IBM PC operating systems. Throughout the 1980s later versions of Aztec C86 (3.xx, 4.xx and 5.xx) added support for MS-DOS &quot;transitory&quot; versions 1 and 2 and which were less robust than the &quot;baseline&quot; MS-DOS version 3 and later which Aztec C86 targeted until its demise.

Finally, Aztec C86 provided C language developers with the ability to produce ROM-able &quot;HEX&quot; code which could then be transferred using a ROM burner directly to an 8086 based processor. Paravirtualization may be more common today but the practice of creating low-level ROM code was more common per-capita during those years when device driver development was often done by application programmers for individual applications, and new devices amounted to a cottage industry. It was not uncommon for application programmers to interface directly with hardware without support from the manufacturer. This practice was similar to Embedded Systems Development today.

Thomas Fenwick and James Goodnow II were the two principal developers of Aztec-C. Fenwick later became notable as the author of the Microsoft Windows CE kernel or NK (&quot;New Kernel&quot;) as it was then called.

== Microsoft C cross compilers ==
=== Early history – 1980s ===
Microsoft C (MSC) has a shorter history than others dating back to the 1980s. The first Microsoft C Compilers were made by the same company who made Lattice C and were rebranded by Microsoft as their own, until MSC 4 was released, which was the first version that Microsoft produced themselves.

In 1987, many developers started switching to Microsoft C, and many more would follow throughout the development of Microsoft Windows to its present state. Products like Clipper and later Clarion emerged that offered easy database application development by using cross language techniques, allowing part of their programs to be compiled with Microsoft C.

Borland C (California company) was available for purchase years before Microsoft released its first C product.

Long before Borland, BSD Unix (Berkeley University) had gotten C from the authors of the C language: Kernighan and Ritchie who wrote it in unison while working for AT&amp;T (labs). K&amp;R&#x27;s original needs was not only elegant 2nd level parsed syntax to replace asm 1st level parsed syntax: it was designed so that a minimal amount of asm be written to support each platform (the original design of C was ability to cross compile using C with the least support code per platform, which they needed.). Also yesterdays C directly related to ASM code wherever not platform dependent. Today&#x27;s C (more-so c++) is no longer C compatible and the asm code underlying can be extremely different than written on a given platform (in Linux: it sometimes replaces and detours library calls with distributor choices). Today&#x27;s C is a 3rd or 4th level language which is used the old way like a 2nd level language.

=== 1987 ===
C programs had long been linked with modules written in assembly language. Most C compilers (even current compilers) offer an assembly language pass (that can be tweaked for efficiency then linked to the rest of the program after assembling).

Compilers like Aztec-C converted everything to assembly language as a distinct pass and then assembled the code in a distinct pass, and were noted for their very efficient and small code, but by 1987 the optimizer built into Microsoft C was very good, and only &quot;mission critical&quot; parts of a program were usually considered for rewriting. In fact, C language programming had taken over as the &quot;lowest-level&quot; language, with programming becoming a multi-disciplinary growth industry and projects becoming larger, with programmers writing user interfaces and database interfaces in higher-level languages, and a need had emerged for cross language development that continues to this day.

By 1987, with the release of MSC 5.1, Microsoft offered a cross language development environment for MS-DOS. 16-bit binary object code written in assembly language (MASM) and Microsoft&#x27;s other languages including QuickBASIC, Pascal, and Fortran could be linked together into one program, in a process they called &quot;Mixed Language Programming&quot; and now &quot;InterLanguage Calling&quot;. If BASIC was used in this mix, the main program needed to be in BASIC to support the internal runtime system that compiled BASIC required for garbage collection and its other managed operations that simulated a BASIC interpreter like QBasic in MS-DOS.

The calling convention for C code, in particular, was to pass parameters in &quot;reverse order&quot; on the stack and return values on the stack rather than in a processor register. There were other programming rules to make all the languages work together, but this particular rule persisted through the cross language development that continued throughout Windows 16- and 32-bit versions and in the development of programs for OS/2, and which persists to this day. It is known as the Pascal calling convention.

Another type of cross compilation that Microsoft C was used for during this time was in retail applications that require handheld devices like the Symbol Technologies PDT3100 (used to take inventory), which provided a link library targeted at an 8088 based barcode reader. The application was built on the host computer then transferred to the handheld device (via a serial cable) where it was run, similar to what is done today for that same market using Windows Mobile by companies like Motorola, who bought Symbol.

=== Early 1990s ===
Throughout the 1990s and beginning with MSC 6 (their first ANSI C compliant compiler) Microsoft re-focused their C compilers on the emerging Windows market, and also on OS/2 and in the development of GUI programs. Mixed language compatibility remained through MSC 6 on the MS-DOS side, but the API for Microsoft Windows 3.0 and 3.1 was written in MSC 6. MSC 6 was also extended to provide support for 32-bit assemblies and support for the emerging Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT which would form the foundation for Windows XP. A programming practice called a thunk was introduced to allow passing between 16- and 32-bit programs that took advantage of runtime binding (dynamic linking) rather than the static binding that was favoured in monolithic 16-bit MS-DOS applications. Static binding is still favoured by some native code developers but does not generally provide the degree of code reuse required by newer best practices like the Capability Maturity Model (CMM).

MS-DOS support was still provided with the release of Microsoft&#x27;s first C++ Compiler, MSC 7, which was backwardly compatible with the C programming language and MS-DOS and supported both 16- and 32-bit code generation.

MSC took over where Aztec C86 left off. The market share for C compilers had turned to cross compilers which took advantage of the latest and greatest Windows features, offered C and C++ in a single bundle, and still supported MS-DOS systems that were already a decade old, and the smaller companies that produced compilers like Aztec C could no longer compete and either turned to niche markets like embedded systems or disappeared.

MS-DOS and 16-bit code generation support continued until MSC 8.00c which was bundled with Microsoft C++ and Microsoft Application Studio 1.5, the forerunner of Microsoft Visual Studio which is the cross development environment that Microsoft provide today.

=== Late 1990s ===
MSC 12 was released with Microsoft Visual Studio 6 and no longer provided support for MS-DOS 16-bit binaries, instead providing support for 32-bit console applications, but provided support for Windows 95 and Windows 98 code generation as well as for Windows NT. Link libraries were available for other processors that ran Microsoft Windows; a practice that Microsoft continues to this day.

MSC 13 was released with Visual Studio 2003, and MSC 14 was released with Visual Studio 2005, both of which still produce code for older systems like Windows 95, but which will produce code for several target platforms including the mobile market and the ARM architecture.

=== .NET and beyond ===
In 2001 Microsoft developed the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which formed the core for their .NET Framework compiler in the Visual Studio IDE. This layer on the operating system which is in the API allows the mixing of development languages compiled across platforms that run the Windows operating system.

The .NET Framework runtime and CLR provide a mapping layer to the core routines for the processor and the devices on the target computer. The command-line C compiler in Visual Studio will compile native code for a variety of processors and can be used to build the core routines themselves.

Microsoft .NET applications for target platforms like Windows Mobile on the ARM architecture cross-compile on Windows machines with a variety of processors and Microsoft also offer emulators and remote deployment environments that require very little configuration, unlike the cross compilers in days gone by or on other platforms.

Runtime libraries, such as Mono, provide compatibility for cross-compiled .NET programs to other operating systems, such as Linux.

Libraries like Qt and its predecessors including XVT provide source code level cross development capability with other platforms, while still using Microsoft C to build the Windows versions. Other compilers like MinGW have also become popular in this area since they are more directly compatible with the Unixes that comprise the non-Windows side of software development allowing those developers to target all platforms using a familiar build environment.

== Free Pascal ==
Free Pascal was developed from the beginning as a cross compiler. The compiler executable (ppcXXX where XXX is a target architecture) is capable of producing executables (or just object files if no internal linker exists, or even just assembly files if no internal assembler exists) for all OS of the same architecture. For example, ppc386 is capable of producing executables for i386-linux, i386-win32, i386-go32v2 (DOS) and all other OSes (see ). For compiling to another architecture, however, a cross architecture version of the compiler must be built first. The resulting compiler executable would have additional &#x27;ross&#x27; before the target architecture in its name. i.e. if the compiler is built to target x64, then the executable would be ppcrossx64.

To compile for a chosen architecture-OS, the compiler switch (for the compiler driver fpc) -P and -T can be used. This is also done when cross-compiling the compiler itself, but is set via make option CPU_TARGET and OS_TARGET. GNU assembler and linker for the target platform is required if Free Pascal does not yet have internal version of the tools for the target platform.

== Clang ==
Clang is natively a cross compiler, at build time you can select which architectures you want Clang to be able to target.

== Plan 9 ==
The heterogenous system Plan 9 and its toolchain does not distinguish between cross and native compilation. Makefiles are architecture independent.

<text>His (or Her) Majesty&#x27;s Ship, abbreviated HMS and H.M.S., is the ship prefix used for ships of the navy in some monarchies. Derivative terms such as HMAS and equivalents in other languages such as SMS are used.

==Commonwealth Realms==
===United Kingdom===
With regard to the separate English and Scottish navies of the medieval period and early modern era, historians usually use terms such as &quot;English Ship&quot; or &quot;Scottish Ship&quot;.

During the late 17th century, following the Restoration, the name Royal Navy was officially adopted, as well as the prefix His Majesty&#x27;s Ship, and later, Her Majesty&#x27;s Ship. The first recorded use of the abbreviated form HMS was in 1789, in respect of HMS &quot;Phoenix&quot;. From 1707 to circa 1800 HBMS (for &quot;His Britannic Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;) was also used.
Submarines in His Majesty&#x27;s service also use the prefix HMS, standing for &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Submarine&quot;, though this is sometimes rendered HMS/m. (See, for example, HMS/m &quot;Tireless&quot;, at IWM). The Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot;, which was a commissioned ship in the Royal Navy, was known as HMY &quot;Britannia&quot;. Otherwise all ships in the Royal Navy are known as HM Ships, though formerly when a distinction was made between three-masted ship-rigged ships and smaller vessels they would be called HM Frigate &quot;X&quot;, or HM Sloop &quot;Y&quot;.

The prefix HMS is also used by shore establishments that are commissioned &quot;stone frigates&quot; in the Royal Navy. Examples include HMS &quot;Excellent&quot;, a training school located on an island in Portsmouth Harbour, and HMS &quot;Vulcan&quot;, in Caithness in the Highland area of Scotland, which is established to test the design of nuclear power systems for use in submarines.

The sample ship name used by the Royal Navy to signify a hypothetical vessel is . This &quot;is&quot; a name that has been used by the Royal Navy in the past; on the eve of World War II the name was given to the Royal Canadian Navy. HMCS &quot;Nonsuch&quot; was the &quot;stone frigate&quot; of the Edmonton Division of the Canadian Naval Reserve.

Prefixing the name by &quot;the&quot;, as in &quot;the HMS Ark Royal&quot;, while common, is considered bad grammar.

British government ships not in the Royal Navy have other designations, such as RFA for ships in the &quot;Royal Fleet Auxiliary&quot;.

===Use outside the United Kingdom===
Historically, variants on HMS have been used by the navies of British colonies. The practice is maintained in several Commonwealth realms – states in which the monarch of the UK is head of state – as well as other Commonwealth countries and former members of the British Empire.

==Denmark==
All Danish Navy ships carry the ship prefix KDM (&quot;Kongelige Danske Marine&quot;) in Danish, but this is translated to HDMS (&quot;Her / His Danish Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;) in English.

==Germany==
 (; ; abbreviated to S.M.S. or SMS) was the ship prefix used by the Prussian Maritime Enterprise (&quot;Seehandlung&quot;), the Prussian Navy, the Imperial German Navy (&quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;) and the Austro-Hungarian Navy (&quot;Kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine&quot;). It was created by translating the British prefix into German.

It was sometimes also abbreviated to S.M. or SM (for &quot;Seiner Majestät&quot;) when a ship was mentioned by class, such as &quot;S.M. Kleiner Kreuzer Emden&quot; (&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Light Cruiser Emden&quot;).

Special forms included
*S.M.Y. (or SMY) = &quot;Seiner Majestät Yacht&quot; (&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Yacht&quot;) for king&#x27;s or emperor&#x27;s yacht
*I.M.Y. = &quot;Ihrer Majestät Yacht&quot; (&quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Yacht&quot;) for the queen&#x27;s or empress&#x27;s yacht.
*S.M.F. = &quot;Seiner Majestät Feuerschiff&quot; (&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Lightvessel&quot;)
*S.M.H. = &quot;Seiner Majestät Hilfsschiff&quot; (&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Auxiliary Ship&quot;)
*S.M.W. = &quot;Seiner Majestät Werkstattschiff&quot; (&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Workshop Ship&quot;)
*S.M.U. = &quot;Seiner Majestät Unterseeboot&quot; (&quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Submarine&quot;, prefixing a number not a name)

==Netherlands==
International prefixes for ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy is HNLMS (&quot;His/Her Netherlands Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;). The Netherlands navy itself uses the prefixes Zr.Ms. (&quot;Zijner Majesteits&quot;, &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s&quot;) when a king is on the throne, and Hr.Ms. (&quot;Harer Majesteits&quot;, &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot;) when there is a queen. This happens automatically at the moment of coronation.

==Norway==
The Royal Norwegian Navy vessels have since 1946 been given the ship prefix KNM, short for &quot;K&quot;ongelig &quot;N&quot;orske &quot;M&quot;arine (Royal Norwegian Navy). In English, they are given the prefix HNoMS, short for &quot;&quot;H&quot;is/Her &quot;No&quot;rwegian &quot;M&quot;ajesty&#x27;s &quot;S&quot;hip&quot; (HNMS could be also used for the Royal Netherlands Navy, for which HNLMS is used instead). Coast Guard vessels are given the prefix KV for &quot;K&quot;yst&quot;V&quot;akt (Coast Guard) in Norwegian and NoCGV for &quot;No&quot;rwegian &quot;C&quot;oast &quot;G&quot;uard &quot;V&quot;essel in English.

==Romania==
Prior to World War II, the subsequent ousting of the monarchy of Romania on 30 December 1947 and post-war Soviet occupation, all Royal Romanian Navy vessels were given the prefix NMS which stands for &quot;Nava Majestăţii Sale&quot; which translates to &quot;His/her Majesty’s Ship&quot; in English.

==Sweden==
In the Royal Swedish Navy, all vessels are given the prefix HMS (&quot;Hans&quot; or &quot;Hennes Majestäts Skepp&quot;, &quot;His&quot; or &quot;Her Majesty’s Ship&quot;). This is true for both surface and submarine vessels. 

Abroad, Swedish navy ships are sometimes given the prefix HSwMS (for &quot;His Swedish Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;), to avoid confusion with other uses of the HMS prefix.

== Thailand ==
In the Royal Thai Navy, ships with a displacement of 150 tons or more use the prefix เรือหลวง (&quot;Royal Ship&quot;), abbreviated ร.ล. meaning ships belonging to the Thai King. In English, the abbreviation HTMS or H.T.M.S. comes from the word &quot;His Thai Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;. For the name of the ship, it must be granted by the King.

== Tonga ==
In the Tongan Maritime Force, commissioned ships use the prefix Vaka O Ene Afio, abbreviated &quot;VOEA&quot;, meaning &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Vessel&quot; in Tongan. The initialism is usually left untranslated in English.

<text>Pete Wendling (June 6, 1888 – April 7, 1974) was an American composer and pianist, born in New York City to German immigrants. He often collaborated with fellow QRS pianist and composer, Max Kortlander. 

He started his working life as a carpenter, but gained fame during the mid-1910s as a popular music composer, with his name appearing on the &quot;Soup and Fish Rag&quot; in 1913. He worked on such hits as &quot;Yaaka Hula Hickey Dula&quot; (recorded by Al Jolson), &quot;Take Me To The Land Of Jazz&quot;, &quot;Take Your Girlie To The Movies&quot;, &quot;Felix The Cat&quot;, and &quot;Oh What A Pal Is Mary&quot;.

Wendling was also one of the top pianists of his era, and set a long-standing record when he appeared at the London Hippodrome for eight consecutive weeks. He joined the Rhythmodik Music Roll Company in 1914, and started to record his performances on paper rolls for player pianos. In 1916 he recorded for American Piano Company (Ampico). In 1918, he joined the largest piano roll company, QRS, and rapidly became one of their most popular artists, his distinctive yet always fresh performances constantly topping their best-selling lists.

He recorded two sides for Okeh Records in 1923, and in 1926, cut another four for Cameo. In 1927, QRS, tightening their belt due to declining sales, released Wendling, and he concentrated on his composing career until his retirement in the 1950s. In 1955, he co-wrote &quot;I Wonder&quot;, which became a UK chart hit for both Jane Froman and Dickie Valentine. Wendling&#x27;s last notable work was &quot;Rich in Love&quot; in 1956.

Married to Anna, he had no children. A resident of Manhattan, he died in New York City in April 1974, aged 85 after several strokes.

<doc id="291623" wikidata="Q738544" url="?curid=291623" title="Shinya Tsukamoto">
<text>is a Japanese filmmaker and actor. With a considerable cult following both domestically and abroad, Tsukamoto is best known for his body horror/cyberpunk film &quot;&quot; (1989), which is considered the defining film of the Japanese Cyberpunk movement, as well as for its companion pieces &quot;Tetsuo II: Body Hammer&quot; (1992) and &quot;&quot; (2009). His other films include &quot;Tokyo Fist&quot; (1995), &quot;Bullet Ballet&quot; (1998), &quot;A Snake of June&quot; (2002), &quot;Vital&quot; (2004), &quot;Kotoko&quot; (2011) and &quot;Killing&quot; (2018).

In addition to starring in almost all his films, Tsukamoto has also appeared as an actor in films by other directors, including Martin Scorsese, Takashi Miike and Hideaki Anno. He has been cited as an influence on popular western filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino, David Fincher, Darren Aronofsky and The Wachowskis.

==Biography==
Tsukamoto began making films at age 14, when his father gave him a Super 8 camera. His cinematic influences include David Lynch, David Cronenberg, and Akira Kurosawa. He made a number of films, ranging from 10-minute shorts to 2-hour features, until his first year at college when he temporarily lost interest in filmmaking. Tsukamoto then started up a theatre group, which soon included Kei Fujiwara, Nobu Kanaoka and Tomorowo Taguchi, all of whom would continue to work with Tsukamoto up through the filming of &quot;Tetsuo: The Iron Man&quot;. One of their theatre productions at this time was &quot;The Adventures of Electric Rod Boy&quot;. At the end of production, Tsukamoto did not want to waste all the effort they had put into building the set, so he decided to shoot a film version.

Tsukamoto&#x27;s early films, &quot;The Phantom of Regular Size&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Adventures Of Electric Rod Boy&quot; (1987), were short subject science fiction films shot on colour 8 mm film that led to his black &amp; white 16 mm feature &quot;Tetsuo: The Iron Man&quot;. Tsukamoto has stated he has a love-hate relationship with Tokyo, and in the end the characters (Tsukamoto and Taguchi) set out to destroy it. Tetsuo is considered one of the prime examples of Japanese cyberpunk.

Tsukamoto&#x27;s next film, &quot;Hiruko the Goblin&quot;, was a more conventional horror film, about demons being unleashed from the gates of hell. He then created a follow-up to &quot;Tetsuo&quot;, &quot;Tetsuo II: Body Hammer&quot; (1992), which revisited many of the same themes as the first but with a bigger budget and shot in colour on 35 mm film. As a result, the film is often interpreted more as a companion piece than a true sequel. In &quot;Body Hammer&quot;, the son of a salaryman (Taguchi) is kidnapped by a group of thugs, who then force the man&#x27;s nascent rage to make him mutate into a gigantic human weapon. &quot;Tokyo Fist&quot; (1995) again dealt with the idea of rage as a transformative force (similar to David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Brood&quot; [1979]). Here, a meek insurance salesman (Tsukamoto) discovers that an old friend of his, now a semi-professional boxer, may be having an affair with his fiancée. The salesman then enters into a rigorous and self-destructive boxing training program to get even.

In &quot;Bullet Ballet&quot; (1998), a man (Tsukamoto) discovers that his longtime girlfriend committed suicide with a gun, and becomes obsessed with getting a gun just like that one. His single minded behaviour causes him to run afoul of a gang of thugs, especially when he shows interest in the young girl who is one of their compatriots. &quot;Gemini&quot; (1999) was an adaptation of an Edogawa Rampo story, in which a country doctor with pretensions of superiority has his life torn apart when another man who appears to be his exact duplicate enters his life. Things are complicated further by the twin taking control of his wife, an amnesiac with a criminal background. &quot;A Snake of June&quot; (2002) once again found Tsukamoto employing the formula of two men in competition for one woman, as a young lady is blackmailed into perverse sexual behaviour against her husband&#x27;s will—until her husband finds that he enjoys the blackmail more than the blackmailer does.

&quot;&quot;Vital&quot;&quot; (2004) again features a love triangle, this time consisting of two women and one man. The story concerns a young man whose girlfriend is killed in a car crash whilst being driven by him. He is a medical student and is given her body to dissect in class (whether by coincidence or intentionally is not clear). Tsukamoto also acted in and directed the short film &quot;Haze&quot; in 2005. In 2006, Tsukamoto directed the horror thriller &quot;Nightmare Detective&quot; (2006). The film centres around a vagrant with the supernatural ability to enter the dreams of others and a police officer who pleads with him to help her solve a series of bizarre murders committed by a serial killer (Tsukamoto) with a similar ability.

Tsukamoto acts in nearly all of his films, with the exception of those that he worked on as a &quot;director for hire&quot; (namely &quot;Hiruko the Goblin&quot; and &quot;Gemini&quot;). Tsukamoto has appeared in many other directors&#x27; films as well, such as Takashi Miike&#x27;s &quot;Dead or Alive 2: Birds&quot; (2000) and &quot;Ichi the Killer&quot; (2001), as well as Teruo Ishii&#x27;s &quot;Blind Beast vs. Dwarf&quot; (2001). He was the lead actor in Takashi Shimizu&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Marebito&quot;&quot; (2004), and appeared more recently in &quot;Welcome to the Quiet Room&quot; (2007), Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Silence&quot; (2016), and Hideaki Anno&#x27;s &quot;Shin Godzilla&quot; (2016) and &quot;Shin Kamen Rider&quot; (2023).

He is also a successful voiceover artist for TV advertising in Japan. He also provided the Japanese voice of Vamp in the 2008 PlayStation 3 game &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;. Tsukamoto was originally set to play the character in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; (after Hideo Kojima&#x27;s first choice, Kaneto Shiozawa, died before casting began) but was unavailable due to scheduling conflicts, so Ryōtarō Okiayu was assigned the role instead.

Tsukamoto was a member of the jury at the Venice International Film Festival in 1997 and 2019.

<text>The Australian Grand Prix is an annual motor racing event which is under contract to host Formula One until 2035. One of the oldest surviving motorsport competitions held in Australia, the Grand Prix has moved frequently with 23 different venues having been used since it was first run at Phillip Island in 1928. The race became part of the Formula One World Championship in 1985. Since 1996, it has been held at the Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne, with the exceptions of 2020 and 2021, when the races were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Before that, it was held in Adelaide.

==History==

===Pre-war===

While an event called the Australian Grand Prix was staged in 1927 at the grass surface Goulburn Racecourse held as a series of sprints, it is generally accepted that the Australian Grand Prix began as the 100 Miles Road Race held at the Phillip Island road circuit in 1928. The inaugural race was won by Arthur Waite in what was effectively an entry supported by the Austin Motor Company, a modified Austin 7. For eight years, races, first called the Australian Grand Prix in 1929, continued on the rectangular dirt road circuit. Bugattis dominated the results, taking four consecutive wins from 1929 to 1932. The last Phillip Island race was in 1935 and the title lapsed for three years. An AGP style event was held on Boxing Day, 1936 at the South Australian town of Victor Harbor for a centennial South Australian Grand Prix before the Australian Grand Prix title was revived in 1938 for the grand opening of what would become one of the world&#x27;s most famous race tracks, Mount Panorama just outside the semi-rural town of Bathurst. Only just completed, with a tar seal for the circuit still a year away, the race was won by Englishman Peter Whitehead racing a new voiturette ERA B-Type that was just too fast for the locally developed machinery. One more race was held, at the Lobethal Circuit near the South Australian town of Lobethal in 1939, before the country was plunged into World War II.

===Post-war===

====Early post-war races====
In the immediate post-war era, racing was sparse with competitors using pre-war cars with supplies cobbled together around the rationing of fuel and tyres. Mount Panorama held the first post-war Grand Prix in 1947, beginning a rotational system between the Australian States, as fostered by the Australian Automobile Association. A mixture of stripped-down production sports cars and Australian &quot;specials&quot; were to take victories as the race travelled amongst temporary converted airfield circuits and street circuits like Point Cook, Leyburn, Nuriootpa and Narrogin before, on the races return to Mount Panorama in 1952, the way to the future was pointed by Doug Whiteford racing a newly imported Talbot-Lago Formula One car to victory. Grand Prix machinery had already been filtering through in the shape of older Maserati and OSCAs and smaller Coopers but had yet to prove to be superior to the locally developed cars. The end of the Australian &quot;specials&quot; was coming, but the magnificent Maybach-based series of specials driven exuberantly by Stan Jones would give many hope for the next few years.

Lex Davison, who for several years would experiment with sports car engines in smaller Formula 2 chassis, took his first of four victories in a Jaguar engined Formula 2 HWM in 1954, while the previous year Whiteford won his third and final Grand Prix as for the first time racing cars thundered around the streets surrounding the Albert Park Lake in inner Melbourne. That circuit, which for four brief years gave Australia the strongest taste of the grandeur surrounding European Grand Prix racing, was 40 years later very much modified, used to host the 1996 Australian Grand Prix as the modern Formula One world championship venue. Jack Brabham took his first of three AGP wins in 1955 at the short Port Wakefield Circuit in South Australia. The race is significant in that Brabham was driving a Bristol powered Cooper T40, the first ever rear-engine car to win the Grand Prix.

The Grand Prix returned to Albert Park in 1956, the year when Melbourne hosted the Summer Olympics, to play host to a group of visiting European teams, led by Stirling Moss and the factory Maserati racing team who brought a fleet of 250F Grand Prix cars and 300S sports racing cars. Moss won the Grand Prix from Maserati teammate Jean Behra. That 1956 race would inspire the next great era of the Grand Prix.

====Tasman Formula====
The growing influence of engineer-drivers Jack Brabham and a couple of years behind him New Zealander Bruce McLaren would transform the race. Brabham, who first won the Grand Prix in 1955 in a Cooper T40 Bristol he had brought home from his first foray into English racing, would test new developments for Cooper during the European winter, beginning a flood of Cooper-Climax Grand Prix machinery into Australia and New Zealand before Brabham started building his own cars, as well as the appearance of Lotus chassis as well, finally killing off the Australian &quot;specials&quot;. With European Formula One restricted by the 1.5-litre regulations and big powerful 2.5-litre Australian cars were tremendously attractive to the European teams and when BRM Grand Prix team toured Australia during the summer of 1962, the seed grew that became the Tasman Series.

The top European Formula One teams and drivers raced the European winters in Australia and New Zealand from 1963 to 1969 playing host to a golden age for racing in the region for which the Australian Grand Prix (and the New Zealand Grand Prix) became jewels of the summer. The popularity of the Tasman formulae was directly responsible for 1966&#x27;s &quot;return to power&quot; in Formula One, and having spent years developing with Repco the Brabham cars and eventually the Oldsmobile-based Repco V8s in the Tasman series gave Jack Brabham the opportunity to unexpectedly dominate Formula One in his Brabhams with a ready-proven lightweight car that left Ferrari and the British &quot;garagistes&quot; struggling with their heavy, technically fragile or underpowered cars until the appearance of the Lotus-Cosworth in 1967.

The Formula One stars of the era all visited the Tasman Series, including World Champions Jim Clark, John Surtees, Phil Hill, Jackie Stewart, Graham Hill and Jochen Rindt, while other F1 regulars Timmy Mayer, Pedro Rodriguez, Piers Courage, leading teams from Cooper, Lotus, Lola, BRM, even the four wheel drive Ferguson P99 and finally, Ferrari, racing against the local stars, Jack Brabham, Bruce McLaren, Denny Hulme, Chris Amon, Frank Gardner, Frank Matich, Leo Geoghegan and Kevin Bartlett. Brabham won the Grand Prix three times, McLaren twice, Clark twice, the second was his last major victory before his untimely death, winning a highly entertaining battle with Chris Amon at the 1968 Australian Grand Prix at Sandown Raceway. Graham Hill won the 1966 race, with Amon winning the final Tasman formulae race in 1969 leading home Ferrari teammate Derek Bell for a dominant 1–2 at Lakeside Raceway.

====Formula 5000====
By the end of the decade, European teams were increasingly reluctant to commit to the Tasman Series in the face of longer home seasons, but also having to develop 2.5-litre versions of their 3.0 litre F1 engines. Local Tasman cars were declining as well and after originally opting a 2.0 litre version of Tasman to be the future of the Australian Grand Prix, the overwhelming support for the already well established Formula 5000 saw natural selection force Confederation of Australian Motorsport (CAMS)&#x27; hand.

For the first half of the 1970s, the Tasman Series continued as a local series primarily for Formula 5000 racers, but by 1976, the Australian and New Zealand legs fractured apart and the Australian Grand Prix separated from the remnants and became a stand-alone race once more. During this era, the former Tasman stars, Matich, Geoghegan and Bartlett would continue on as a new generation of drivers emerged, some like Garrie Cooper (Elfin) and Graham McRae developing their own cars while others like Max Stewart, John McCormack and Alfredo Costanzo using European-built cars, mostly Lolas. Matich won two Grands Prix is his own cars before Stewart and McRae each took a pair of wins. Towards the end of the 1970s, the race again became a home to returning European-based antipodeans like Alan Jones and Larry Perkins with Warwick Brown winning the 1977 race, while in 1976, touring car racer John Goss completed a remarkable double becoming the only driver to win the Grand Prix and the Bathurst 1000 touring car race.

====Calder Park====
Declining economy and the dominance of the local scene by Group C touring cars towards the latter part of the 1970s saw Formula 5000 gradually fall out of favour. By 1980, the decision to replace was once again imminent; however, the form of Alan Jones in Formula One saw entrepreneur Bob Jane seize an opportunity to bring Formula One back as the Grand Prix Formula. The 1980 event held at Jane&#x27;s Calder Park Raceway saw a combined field of Formula One and Formula 5000 padded out with the Australised version of Formula Atlantic cars, Formula Pacific. The newly crowned world champion, Jones swept the field aside in his Williams-Ford, but with only two F1 cars entering (the other being the Alfa Romeo 179 driven by Bruno Giacomelli).

The continuing disintegration of F5000 saw Jane concentrate the next four Grands Prix on the Formula Pacific (later rebadged as Formula Mondial) category and importing Formula One drivers to race the locals in fields almost entirely made up of Ralt RT4s. Brazilian Roberto Moreno dominated this era, winning three of the four races, ceding only the 1982 race to future four-time World Champion Alain Prost.

Jane&#x27;s attempt to bring the World Championship to Calder Park ultimately failed, as did a bid by Melbourne&#x27;s other circuit Sandown (though Sandown was able to attract a round of the World Sportscar Championship to its upgraded track in 1984). As it turned out, F1 would be tempted away from Melbourne by a far more attractive option but it was listed as a reserve race in the 1982 F1 calendar.

===Formula One===
====Adelaide (1985–1995)====

The Australian Grand Prix became a round of the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1985 with the last race of the season held on the street circuit in Adelaide. The Adelaide Street Circuit, which held its last Formula One race in , was known as a challenging, demanding and tricky circuit that often produced races of attrition, and the whole event was very popular with drivers, teams and fans. Whenever the teams came to Adelaide they enjoyed the party atmosphere.

The first ever Australian Grand Prix to be included as part of the Formula One World Championship was also the 50th AGP. The new 3.78 km Adelaide Street Circuit saw Brazilian Ayrton Senna on pole with a time of 1:19.843 in his Lotus–Renault. The race itself was a battle between Senna and Finland&#x27;s Keke Rosberg driving a Williams–Honda for the last time. Run in oppressively hot conditions, the last race of the season ran to its 2-hour time limit, though all scheduled 82 laps were run. Rosberg ultimately prevailed finishing 43 seconds in front of the Ligier–Renaults of Frenchmen Jacques Laffite and Philippe Streiff who actually collided at the hairpin at the end of Brabham Straight with only one lap to go when Streiff tried a passing move that resulted in his car suffering broken suspension, though not bad enough to cause retirement. Three time World Champion Austrian Niki Lauda drove his last Formula One race at this event. After starting 16th in his McLaren, he made his way to the lead by lap 57, but a lack of brakes cause him to crash into a wall in a sad end to his Formula One career. Australia had its own driver in the race with World Champion Alan Jones driving a Lola–Hart. Jones, who started 19th, stalled at the start but fought his way to sixth by lap 20 before retiring later in the lap with electrical failure. The 1986 event was a three-way race for the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Briton Nigel Mansell and Brazilian Nelson Piquet in Williams–Hondas and Frenchman Alain Prost, in a comparatively underpowered McLaren–TAG/Porsche, were competing for the drivers&#x27; title. Mansell needed only third to guarantee the title, whilst Prost and Piquet needed to win and for Mansell to finish fourth or lower to take the title. Finn Keke Rosberg led for 62 laps before a puncture that caused damage to his McLaren; this was the 1982 champion&#x27;s last Formula One race. Whilst comfortably in the top three with 20 laps to go, Mansell&#x27;s Williams suffered a spectacular mechanical failure, with a rear tyre puncture at on the Brabham Straight, creating a huge shower of sparks as the floor of the vehicle dragged along the bitumen surface. Mansell fought to control the violently veering car and steered it to a safe stop. Prost took the lead, as Mansell&#x27;s teammate Piquet had pitted as a pre-cautionary measure, and the Frenchman won the race and the championship. Prost had to fight back after a mid-race puncture, and stopped soon after the finish so as not to waste fuel, something he had done at every race he finished since his disqualification from the 1985 San Marino Grand Prix for being underweight after his McLaren ran out of fuel on his slow down lap after crossing the line first. 1987 saw Gerhard Berger win in his Ferrari while Ayrton Senna finished second but was then disqualified for technical irregularities in his last race for Lotus; Berger&#x27;s teammate Michele Alboreto was then moved up to second place to make the final result a Ferrari 1–2.

1988, the last Grand Prix of the turbo era, saw Alain Prost win his seventh race of the season from McLaren teammate and newly crowned World Champion Ayrton Senna with outgoing champion Nelson Piquet third for Lotus, giving Honda turbo&#x27;s all three podium positions. The race was also the 15th win and 15th pole in 16 races in a season of total dominance for McLaren-Honda, a domination not seen before or since in Formula One. 1989 was hit by a deluge of rain and the drivers, notably Prost, did not want to start the race because of the very wet conditions, particularly on the Brabham straight. This event came after controversial events 2 weeks before at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, where Prost had crashed into his hated teammate Senna, and Senna got going again and finished 1st on the road but after political discussions was disqualified for cutting the chicane before the pit straight at Suzuka; the repercussions of which dawned on the race. McLaren had decided to appeal Senna&#x27;s disqualification; so Senna still had a chance of winning the championship. The race was delayed for sometime and there were discussions about whether the race should be started. Senna qualified on pole position, and had every intention of starting the race. The circuit was still being hammered by rain and was covered by water, but the drivers, including Prost relented and eventually they started. But an unconvinced Prost came in after one lap and withdrew; and Senna- who was still in an awful mental state from the previous race, immediately began driving as fast as he could. By the end of the first lap, due to Pierluigi Martini&#x27;s slow Minardi holding up the two faster Williams cars of Belgian Thierry Boutsen and Italian Riccardo Patrese, Senna was an astonishing nine seconds ahead of Martini; the Williams cars soon passed Martini but by the end of the third lap, Senna was 23 seconds ahead of second-placed Boutsen. Yet even with such a huge lead which he extended even further, Senna continued to push very hard- taking very daring chances even for himself; the psychological dominance F1 had exuded over the Brazilian meant that he was known to take chances that most other drivers would not. Going down the Brabham straight on lap 13, Senna came up behind Briton Martin Brundle&#x27;s Brabham-Judd, and Brundle decided to move over to let Senna pass. But Senna was blinded by thick spray; and the Brazilian did not lift off, causing him to hit the back of Brundle&#x27;s car, tearing off his front left wheel and suspension and resulting in the Brazilian&#x27;s retirement. This effectively handing Prost his third Drivers&#x27; Championship; McLaren&#x27;s appeal had not been decided yet, but with Senna failing to score, he was mathematically unable to catch Prost even if his Japanese Grand Prix victory stood, and it was not only overturned but Senna received a $100,000 fine and a six-month ban, both of which were rescinded. Boutsen won the race in the unimproved conditions, with the race called after it reached the two-hour time limit.

1990 was the 500th World Championship Grand Prix ever held; and it came after yet more controversial events at Suzuka. Senna had crashed into Prost at the very first corner on the first lap of the race; and he won the Drivers&#x27; Championship for the second time. The Australian Grand Prix that year was an incredibly exciting race: Senna led for 61 laps, but crashed near the entrance to the permanent race course because of gearbox problems. The race then turned into a dead-heat sprint between Nelson Piquet in his Benetton-Ford and Nigel Mansell in his Ferrari. Mansell charged through the field and repeatedly broke the lap record in pursuit of his former Williams teammate. This almost ended in disaster when the Ferrari almost hit the Benetton at the end of the Brabham Straight in a last-ditch overtaking move on the last lap. Piquet won from the Ferraris of Mansell and Prost. There was pre-race controversy when Prost refused to take part in both the annual end of season drivers&#x27; photo and the special photo shoot with the World Champions in attendance (including legendary five-time champion Juan Manuel Fangio, three-time champions Sir Jack Brabham, Jackie Stewart, Niki Lauda, and Nelson Piquet; and other world champions James Hunt, Alan Jones, Denny Hulme and Senna), as Prost was still disgusted and angry did not wish to appear in the photos with Senna following their controversial first corner crash in the previous race in Japan which gave the World Championship to Senna.

The 1991 race was notable for being held in extremely wet and tricky conditions and the race was eventually stopped after 14 of the scheduled 82 laps and Ayrton Senna was declared the winner. Prost had been fired from Ferrari for making unsavory comments about the car after Suzuka; he did not compete in this race. The Drivers&#x27; Championship had already been decided in Senna&#x27;s favour; but the Constructors&#x27; Championship was still yet to be decided between McLaren and Williams. Senna&#x27;s victory plus his teammate Gerhard Berger&#x27;s third gave McLaren its fourth consecutive Constructors&#x27; Championship; Williams (which was behind McLaren in points) drivers Mansell finished second (but crashed near the race&#x27;s end at the chicane after the pits) and Riccardo Patrese finished fifth. This race held the record of being the shortest ever Formula One race as it only lasted 52 kilometres (33 miles)/24 minutes. It would eventually be surpassed by the 2021 Belgian Grand Prix, which lasted three laps, but was classified after only one official lap. Triple World Champion Nelson Piquet, who finished fifth, retired from Grand Prix racing following the race.

1992 saw Senna drive very hard to try to stay with new world champion Mansell&#x27;s dominant Williams; this ended in Senna running into the back of Mansell at the last corner. Mansell retired from Formula One and went to compete in CART in the United States; Senna&#x27;s teammate Gerhard Berger won the race. 1993 saw Senna win what was to be his 41st and final victory and final race for McLaren ahead of Alain Prost, who was competing in his final Formula One race in a Williams before he too retired. Senna embraced his once extremely bitter rival Prost on the podium. It was announced around this time that the Australian Grand Prix would be moving to Melbourne for 1996.

The 1994 was to see yet another memorable weekend. Following his win at the Japanese Grand Prix, Damon Hill was now one point behind championship leader Michael Schumacher. Nigel Mansell, returning to Formula One in place of the late Senna, was on pole but a poor start resulted in the two championship rivals Hill and Schumacher battling for the lead. But on lap 36, Schumacher went off the track, a result of oversteer, and this allowed Hill to catch up with Schumacher and take the inside line for the next corner. Schumacher turned in on Hill&#x27;s Williams (whether on purpose or accidentally remains unknown) which sent the Benetton up on two wheels and into the tyre barrier, Schumacher retiring on the spot. Hill came out of the incident with a broken wishbone on his front-left suspension, he pitted and retired from the race, handing the title to Schumacher. The sister Williams of the 41-year-old Nigel Mansell went on to win the race, becoming the oldest Grand Prix winner since Jack Brabham in 1970.

In 1995, Mika Häkkinen suffered a tyre failure at the early part of the first qualifying session at the high speed Brewery Bend between Jones and Brabham Straights, which resulted in him crashing heavily into the outside wall. He was critically injured in the crash and was saved only due to an emergency cricothyroidotomy that was performed by the side of the track by Sid Watkins. This incident forged a strong bond between Häkkinen and team principal Ron Dennis, and also sent forth a new movement for extra safety in the sport. Luckily, Häkkinen recovered fully and was fit to race again in 1996, thus missing only one race. Häkkinen climbed back into a Formula One car at Paul Ricard three months after the accident. The final F1 race at Adelaide was won by Damon Hill in a Williams, with almost all of his main rivals including Schumacher retiring, and Hill finished two laps ahead of second-placed Olivier Panis.

==== Melbourne (1996–2019, 2022–present)====

In 1993 prominent Melbourne businessman Ron Walker began working with the Kennett government to make Melbourne the host of the event. After the government of Jeff Kennett spent an undisclosed amount, it was announced on 17 December 1993 (less than a week after the South Australian election) that the race would be shifted to a rebuilt Albert Park Circuit in Melbourne. The race would move to Melbourne from 1996. 

Bernie Ecclestone, the then-president of Formula One Management, the group that runs modern-day Formula One in conjunction with the Federation Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), once said that it took 10 minutes to do the deal with Melbourne that would see the Victorian capital host the Australian Grand Prix from 1996. It was thought that Melbourne&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics, and the subsequently successful bid by northern rival city Sydney to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, was a driving force behind Melbourne&#x27;s motivation to wrest the Australian Grand Prix away from Adelaide. The Australian Grand Prix at Adelaide in 1985–1995 was always the last event in the Formula One calendar – but from 1996 onwards, it has usually been the first event or was held early in the season.

The decision to hold the race there was controversial. A series of protests were organised by the &quot;Save Albert Park&quot; group, which claimed that the race turned a public park into a private playground for one week per year. Additionally, they claimed that the race cost a great deal of money that would be better spent, if it were to be spent on motor racing, on a permanent circuit elsewhere. Finally, they said that the claimed economic benefits of the race were false or exaggerated. The race organisers and the government claimed that the economic benefits to the state, although unquantifiable, outweighed the costs, and highlighted that the park&#x27;s public amenities have been greatly improved from the World War II vintage facilities previously located at Albert Park; the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre (scene of many Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games events) being the centre piece and best known of the revitalised facilities. Opponents of holding the race in the park point out that the Aquatic Centre adds nothing to the Grand Prix, is effectively closed for weeks surrounding the event and could have been built independent of the car race.

Albert Park, within easy reach of the Melbourne central business district, became home to the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. A 16-turn circuit, which measures in its current guise, it was built utilising a combination of public roads and a car park within the park. The circuit is renowned as being a smooth and high-speed test for Formula One teams and drivers. Its characteristics are similar to the only other street circuit set in a public park used in the Formula One World Championship, the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Montreal which hosts the Canadian Grand Prix.
The promotional theme for the first race in Melbourne was &quot;Melbourne – What a Great Place for the Race&quot;. Some 401,000 people turned out for the four days leading up to and including the first race in 1996, which remains a record for the event. The logistics of creating a temporary circuit and hosting an event of the magnitude of a Formula One Grand Prix from scratch were not lost on the international visitors, with Melbourne winning the F1 Constructors&#x27; Association Award for the best organised Grand Prix of the year in its first two years (1996 and 1997).

It took just three corners for the Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park to gain worldwide attention. On the first lap of the first race in 1996, Jordan&#x27;s Martin Brundle was launched into the air in an enormous accident. Footage of the crash, and Brundle&#x27;s subsequent rush back to the pits to take the spare car for the restart, ensured the first race in Melbourne gained widespread coverage. The race was won by Williams&#x27;s Damon Hill.

The 1997 race saw McLaren, through David Coulthard, break a drought of 50 races without a victory. The next year was a McLaren benefit, with Mika Häkkinen and Coulthard lapping the entire field en route to a dominant 1–2 finish. The result was clouded by controversy when Coulthard pulled over with two laps remaining to allow Häkkinen to win, honouring a pre-race agreement between the pair that whoever made it to the first corner in the lead on lap one would be allowed to win. Ferrari won its first Grand Prix in Melbourne in 1999, but it was not with team number one Michael Schumacher. Northern Irishman Eddie Irvine took his maiden victory after the all-conquering McLarens of Häkkinen and Coulthard retired before half-distance. Schumacher broke his Melbourne drought the following year when he headed a dominant Ferrari 1–2 with new teammate Rubens Barrichello. The 2001 event, also won by Michael Schumacher, was marked by tragedy when 52-year-old volunteer marshal Graham Beveridge was killed after a high-speed accident involving Ralf Schumacher and Jacques Villeneuve on lap five. Villeneuve&#x27;s B.A.R. rode up across the back of Schumacher&#x27;s Williams and crashed into the fence, behind which Beveridge was standing; Beveridge was hit by a tyre that flew off of Villeneuve&#x27;s car.

The start of the 2002 race saw pole-sitter Barrichello and Williams&#x27;s Ralf Schumacher come together at Turn One in a spectacular accident that saw 11 of the 22 cars eliminated before the end of the opening lap. Michael Schumacher dominated thereafter to post a third straight Melbourne win, but his achievements were overshadowed by the fifth place of Australian Mark Webber on his Formula One debut. Webber, in an underpowered and underfunded Minardi, had to recover from a botched late pit stop and resist the challenges of Toyota&#x27;s Mika Salo in the closing stages, and took to the podium after the race with Australian team owner Paul Stoddart in one of Melbourne&#x27;s more memorable Grand Prix moments. The next year, 2003, saw Coulthard again win for McLaren in a race held in variable conditions. Normal service was resumed in 2004 with the Ferraris of Schumacher and Barrichello running rampant – within two laps of Friday practice, Schumacher had obliterated the Albert Park lap record, and sailed to a crushing win. In 2005, the race was won by Renault&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella after a storm during Saturday qualifying produced a topsy-turvy grid. Barrichello and Fisichella&#x27;s teammate Fernando Alonso came through the field from 11th and 13th on the grid respectively to join pole sitter Fisichella on the podium.

In 2006, Alonso took his first Australian win in an accident-marred race that featured four safety car periods. In 2007 Kimi Räikkönen won in his first race for Ferrari, while rookie Lewis Hamilton became the first driver in 11 years to finish on the podium in his F1 debut, finishing third behind his McLaren teammate Alonso. Hamilton won the 2008 race which had three safety car periods and only six finishers. In 2009 Jenson Button took the victory, driving for debutant team Brawn GP, which was having its first race after Ross Brawn had bought the team following Honda&#x27;s withdrawal from Formula One. The team was formed from the remnants of Honda Racing F1 who had withdrawn from the sport following the 2008 season. The race ended with Button, who had led from the start, leading the field over the line after the safety car had been deployed with three laps remaining following a crash between Sebastian Vettel and Robert Kubica, who had been fighting for second place. This promoted Button&#x27;s teammate, fellow Brawn GP driver Rubens Barrichello, to second, marking a historic 1-2 for the team. Toyota&#x27;s Jarno Trulli was given a 25-second penalty for passing Lewis Hamilton for third place under yellow flags during that safety car period, which promoted Hamilton into that position. However, Hamilton was later disqualified and docked his points for &quot;deliberately misleading stewards&quot;, with Trulli reinstated in third. The results earned by Brawn, Williams, and Toyota were awarded, despite an appeal being held two weeks later against a ruling on the legality of the teams&#x27; diffuser design. The outcome of the appeal was in favour of the teams, their diffusers were declared legal under the new rules and there were no changes to the results of the race.

2010 again saw Button win at Melbourne. Starting from fourth, he gambled on an early change to slick tires under drying conditions that let him move up to second place after losing several positions at the start. Sebastian Vettel retired with mechanical issues after qualifying on pole and leading until his retirement, handing Button the victory. The 2011 race saw Vettel take victory in the Red Bull, with Hamilton second and Vitaly Petrov third for Lotus. This was the first ever podium for a Russian Formula One driver. 2012 saw Button win for the third time in four years at the circuit. 2013 saw a surprise victory with Raikkonen in the Lotus winning from Alonso and Vettel. The reintroduction of V6 turbo hybrid engines for saw a dominant performance from Mercedes&#x27;s Nico Rosberg at the Grand Prix, who took the victory from the McLarens of Kevin Magnussen and Button, both of whom were promoted due to the disqualification of Daniel Ricciardo in the Red Bull post race for illegal fuel flow. 2015 saw Hamilton take the victory from teammate Rosberg, with Vettel completing the top three.

In 2020, it was planned to hold the Grand Prix despite the coronavirus epidemic in the country. Ferrari and AlphaTauri as teams based in Italy, the most coronavirus-infected country in Europe at the time, expressed concern about the possibility of leaving the quarantine zone. One of McLaren&#x27;s mechanics got flu-like symptoms when he arrived in Australia, his coronavirus test returned positive and the British team withdrew from the race. Later, a photographer was also confirmed to have coronavirus. It was announced that the Grand Prix would still take place, but without spectators, however two hours before the first practice started the event was cancelled.

In June 2022, Melbourne&#x27;s contract to host the Australian Grand Prix, which was due to expire in 2025, was extended to 2035. The new contract stipulates that the Australian Grand Prix will be one of the first three rounds of the season over the contract period and will host a minimum of five season-opening races over the 13 years between 2023 and 2035. From 2023, Formula 2 and Formula 3 races will form part of the race weekend schedule. A further two-year extension was signed in December 2022, ensuring that the race would remain in Melbourne until 2037.

After a two-year absence as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Australian Grand Prix returned in 2022. Unlike previous years, when it was the opening event of the season, the 2022 Australian Grand Prix was instead the third event of the season. In the months before the Grand Prix, in consultation with drivers, the circuit underwent several significant revisions, which were the first and most significant changes since the inaugural 1996 Australian Grand Prix, including the first track resurfacing since then. Turns 9 and 10 were completely redesigned; where they formed a right–left chicane with a heavy braking zone on the approach, the redesign saw them removed. This was done to raise the approach speed for old turns 11 and 12. Several other corners were reprofiled to encourage overtaking, most notably the old turn 13, which was widened to create additional racing lines. Positive camber was also added to allow drivers to carry more speed through the corner. The main straight and pit lane were also redesigned, with the pit lane wall moved two metres closer to the circuit so that the edge of the circuit sat directly next to the wall. The 2022 Grand Prix saw Ferrari&#x27;s Charles Leclerc achieve his first career grand slam, having started in pole position, set the fastest lap, led every lap, and won the race ahead of Red Bull&#x27;s Sergio Pérez and Mercedes&#x27; George Russell. It was the first grand slam for an individual Ferrari driver since Fernando Alonso&#x27;s at the 2010 Singapore Grand Prix. The 2022 edition set a new attendance record at the circuit for the weekend, with a reported 419,114 attendees, including 128,294 on race day; these figures made the 2022 Grand Prix the highest attended Grand Prix ever held in Melbourne and one of the most popular sporting weekends in Australian history. The 2023 edition, which saw Max Verstappen win his maiden Australian Grand Prix, would break the record with 444,631 attendees, and would also break a Formula One record; the race, which ended with twelve cars left running, is the first ever to have three red flags throughout the session. This came after a chaotic race that saw many incidents; the Formula 2 and Formula 3 races, held the same weekend, had a similar outcome.

The 2024 Australian Grand Prix, won by Carlos Sainz Jr., was notable for breaking numerous attendance records. The event sold out for the first time in its history, and set a new attendance record at the circuit for the weekend with 452,055 spectators, making it the most attended sporting event ever in Melbourne, and the fourth highest attended Formula One Grand Prix of all time, following the 1995 edition of the race, held in Adelaide, with 520,000 attendees, and the 2023 and 2024 British Grands Prix, which both drew 480,000 attendees.

==Calendar change==
The move of the Australian Grand Prix to Melbourne saw a change in the time of year that the Formula 1 teams and personnel made their annual voyage to Australia. Adelaide, for each of its 11 years, was the final race of the F1 season, usually in October or November, while Melbourne has been the first race of the season in 22 of the 27 times it has hosted the Grand Prix. As such, the Albert Park circuit has seen the Formula One debuts of many drivers. 1997 World Champion Jacques Villeneuve made his race debut in Melbourne&#x27;s first year of 1996, and became one of three men to secure pole position in his maiden Grand Prix. Other prominent names to debut in Melbourne are seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton (2007), four-time World Champion Max Verstappen (2015), two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso and one-time champion Kimi Räikkönen (both in 2001); former Australian F1 driver, Mark Webber, also made his debut there in 2002.

As part of celebrations for the tenth running of the event at Albert Park in 2005, Webber drove his Williams F1 car over the Sydney Harbour Bridge in a promotional event, and the Melbourne city streets hosted a parade of F1 machinery and Supercars, Australia&#x27;s highest-profile domestic motor sport category. For over thirty years, Supercars have competed in the Supercars Challenge non-championship event at the Australian Grand Prix. In 2018, the event was contested for championship points for the first time, and was known as the Melbourne 400.

The 2021 event was originally scheduled to open the season in March, but moved to November due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and travel disruptions, then cancelled on 6 July. It was also going through several changes to make the track faster.

==Economic impact==
An issue that is frequently debated amongst both supporters and opponents of the Australian Grand Prix centres around the event&#x27;s economic impact for the state of Victoria; proponents of the event claim that the event increases tourism, creates jobs and generates millions of dollars for the state of Victoria, while opponents dispute the event&#x27;s economic benefits and cite the cost on taxpayers to host the event, as well as the disruptions generated by the event. In 2014, the Victorian government claimed the annual economic impact of hosting the Australian Grand Prix was between $32 million and $39 million, with the event generating significant economic, social and cultural benefits including job creation, industry development, inward investment and tourism, while opponents of the event claimed that the event cost Victorian taxpayers over $50 million to host.

According to a 2022 economic impact assessment conducted by Ernst &amp; Young, the 2022 Australian Grand Prix generated an estimated $92 million of direct spending in the Victorian economy and boosted Victoria&#x27;s Gross State Product by an estimated $171 million, with the Grand Prix also credited for driving up hotel occupancy and stimulating patronage for hospitality businesses. This mirrors a 2011 EY report commissioned by Tourism Victoria, which found international exposure and tourism spending stemming from hosting the Grand Prix generated between $32.04 million and $39.34 million for Victoria&#x27;s Gross State Product during the period in which the Grand Prix was held, while also generating between 351 and 411 full-time equivalent jobs. According to an Economic Impact Assessment conducted by EY, the 2023 Australian Grand Prix contributed an estimated $268 million to the Victorian economy, including $144 million in direct expenditure and the creation of 1,149 full-time equivalent jobs, with $128 million of direct investment contributed by 81,000 international and interstate visitors who attended the event.

However, a cost-benefit analysis of the Australian Grand Prix done for the Auditor-General in 2005 revealed a net economic loss for Victoria, with the estimated costs of the event exceeding the benefits to Victorian taxpayers by 5 per cent, a 2007 auditor-general&#x27;s report found costs to host the event exceeded benefits by $6.7 million, while a 2012 report commissioned by Economists at Large for Save Albert Park estimated that the 2012 Grand Prix resulted in a net economic loss to Victoria of between $48.8m and $66.7m, with a mid-range estimate of $60.55m. The 2007 Australian Grand Prix ran at a $34.6 million loss, while according to Crikey, the Australian Grand Prix made losses of $59.97 million in 2014, $61.7 million in 2015, $61 million in 2016 and $57.1 million in 2017.

Over the decade preceding 2022, the Australian Grand Prix collectively cost Victorian taxpayers $537.5 million to host, with the 2019 Australian Grand Prix alone costing Victorian taxpayers $60.2 million to host, the 2022 Australian Grand Prix alone costing Victorian taxpayers $78.1 million to host, and the 2023 Grand Prix alone costing Victorian taxpayers $100.6 million to host. The 2019 event generated $55 million in revenue but cost $115.2 million to stage, the 2022 event generated $75.1 million in revenue but cost $153.2 million to stage, and the 2023 event generated $96.9 million in revenue but cost $197.6 million to stage.

==Spectator attendance since 1995==

Following the move of the Australian Grand Prix to Melbourne, spectator attendance peaked at 452,055 in 2024, but has never reached that of the last Adelaide race in 1995.

In 2009, higher unemployment and a snap public transport strike were cited by Victorian Premier John Brumby as a reason for a slight drop in crowds. Attendance numbers improved in 2010 to an estimate of 305,000 – the largest since the 2005 race.

In contrast to other major sporting events in Australia such as the AFL Grand Final, the Melbourne Cup, the Australian Open and the Boxing Day Test, the Australian Grand Prix Corporation does not release precise crowd figures for the Australian Grand Prix, citing security concerns; in responding to a freedom of information request, the Australian Grand Prix Corporation stated in 2022 that it believes that crowd figures are sensitive from a security and safety perspective, and disclosing it has the potential to affect the security of Victoria by assisting the operational system of possible threat actors. Following an August 2023 freedom-of-information ruling by the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner which stated that that disclosure was important for &quot;transparency and accountability&quot;, in September 2024, the Australian Grand Prix Corporation went to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal to fight an order to reveal how it counts crowds for the Australian Grand Prix.

Official attendance numbers, which are inexact and have been challenged by the anti-Grand Prix lobby group Save Albert Park as gross overestimates, have been as follows:

*1995 (Adelaide) – 520,000 (210,000 on race day)
*1996 (Melbourne) – 401,000 (150,000 on race day)
*1997 – 289,000
*2004 – 360,885 (121,500 on race day)
*2005 – 359,000 (103,000 on race day)
*2006 – 301,800
*2007 – 301,000 (105,000 on race day)
*2008 – 303,000 (108,000 on race day)
*2009 – 286,900
*2010 – 305,000 (108,500 on race day)
*2011 – 298,000 (111,000 on race day)
*2012 – 313,700 (114,900 on race day)
*2013 – 323,000 (103,000 on race day)
*2014 – 314,900 (100,500 on race day)
*2015 – 296,600 (101,000 on race day)
*2016 – 272,300 (90,200 on race day)
*2017 – 296,600
*2018 – 295,000
*2019 – 324,000 (100,000 on race day)
*2022 – 419,114 (128,294 on race day)
*2023 – 444,631 (131,124 on race day)
*2024 – 452,055 (132,106 on race day)

<doc id="291635" wikidata="Q477824" url="?curid=291635" title="Amrozi">
<text>Ali Amrozi bin Haji Nurhasyim (, 5 July 1962 – 9 November 2008) was an Indonesian terrorist who was convicted and executed for his role in carrying out the Christmas Eve 2000 Indonesia bombings and 2002 Bali bombings. Amrozi was the brother of Huda bin Abdul Haq, also known as Muklas, who coordinated the bombing attack. Amrozi was executed together with Muklas and their co-conspirator, Imam Samudra.

==Early life==
Amrozi was born in Tenggulun, Lamongan, East Java in 1962, the fifth of 13 children. Along with his brothers Muklas and Ali Imron, he attended the Al-Mukmin Islamic school founded by Abu Bakar Bashir. His family were strictly religious, following the Wahhabist school of Islam which has its roots in Saudi Arabia. Amrozi&#x27;s grandfather established the first &quot;pesantren&quot; in Tenggulun. His father Nur Hasyim taught his sons that Javanese customs were considered heresy under Sharia law and were therefore to be eradicated. Nur Hasyim was involved in the Indonesian independence struggle against the Dutch, often regaling his sons with tales of heroism by his fellow Muslims.

Amrozi displayed little interest in school or religious studies. Police psychiatric reports undertaken after the Bali bombings describe him as &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;shallow&quot; and report that he was easily influenced by others. They describe him as having an immature personality and lower than normal intellectual capacity. Amrozi&#x27;s brother, Ali Imron, reported that Amrozi was continually in trouble at school and at home, being banned and expelled by teachers and stealing items from his own home and selling them. He only made it to the second year of high school. At the age of 23 Amrozi married for the first time; marrying a local girl with the marriage lasting two years, producing a daughter. He attempted high school again but dropped out soon after. Seemingly without purpose and lacking direction he began vandalising Javanese graves in his village in an apparent attempt to gain approval from his strictly religious and respected father. He mortified his parents by desecrating the grave of a respected village elder, subsequently spending a week in police custody.

Amrozi&#x27;s elder brother Muklas was a respected member of a &quot;pesantren&quot; in Malaysia. Amrozi had not seen him for over ten years and Muklas had, to some degree, been a stabilising influence in Amrozi&#x27;s early adult years. Amrozi decided to visit Muklas but was initially shunned and rejected because of his errant ways. He was devastated by this and realised that to become accepted he needed to become a good Muslim. Amrozi ceased smoking and watching movies. He began praying five times a day in his efforts to gain the acceptance of Muklas and Muklas finally agreed to let him stay.

In the 1990s Amrozi attended the Lukman Nul Hakim &quot;pesantren&quot; where he was lectured at least once by a radical Islamic cleric, Abu Bakar Bashir, expelled from Indonesia for treason.

Amrozi was talented with his hands and became the local repairman, fixing cars and mobile phones. By trade he became a mechanic and owned the van used in the Sari Club bombing. It was Amrozi who purchased the explosives for the bombing.

==2002 Bali bombings==
On the evening of 12 October 2002, two bombs exploded in the Kuta tourist strip on the Indonesian island of Bali. One hit Paddy&#x27;s Irish Bar, and the second exploded in a van outside the nearby Sari club. A total of 202 people died as a result. A third bomb exploded near Bali&#x27;s US consulate, but no one was hurt. Upon his arrest on 5 November 2002, Amrozi admitted to playing a role in the attacks, then claimed responsibility for other bombings in Jakarta, Ambon and Mojokerto, as well as church bombings in Medan, Batam and Pekanbaru.

===Trial===
His two brothers Muklas and Ali Imron were also both involved. Muklas was suspected of converting Amrozi to militancy when the two were reunited in Malaysia in the late 1980s; and Muklas was later convicted of coordinating the bombing. Both of his brothers were taken into police custody, and Muklas was sentenced to the death penalty and executed with Amrozi.

Amrozi was allegedly motivated by his view of American foreign policy, which he deemed to have an imperialist agenda toward the Islamic world. He claimed in court that he was motivated to attack westerners in Kuta after learning from Australians of the decadent behaviour of white people while on holidays in Bali.

In an interview with the chief of investigations, General I Made Mangku Pastika, when asked about Amrozi&#x27;s feelings toward the attack said:
Amrozi&#x27;s seemingly nonchalant demeanor throughout his trial earned him nicknames such as &quot;The Smiling Assassin&quot;, &quot;The Smiling Bomber&quot; and &quot;The Laughing Bomber&quot;. His brother, Ali Imron, gave damning evidence against Amrozi that proved a turning point in the case against Amrozi.

===Sentence and execution===
On 7 August 2003, he was found guilty for his role in carrying out the Bali bombing and sentenced to the death penalty with execution by a firing squad. His execution was delayed for five years, due to legal technicalities: the law under which he was convicted was not in effect at the time of the bombing, and it was ruled illegal by the Indonesian High Court in July 2004. Originally incarcerated in Denpasar&#x27;s Kerobokan Prison, he was moved to the high-security prison island of Nusakambangan in October 2005 after a thousand protestors stormed the Denpasar prison, shouting &quot;Kill Amrozi, kill Amrozi!&quot; on the third anniversary of the bombing. While in prison, on 12 May 2008, he remarried his first wife, Rahma, in a ceremony which was conducted in his absence in his home village, while remaining married to his current wife.

Together with Imam Samudra and his brother, Muklas, who both received death sentences, he launched a constitutional challenge against the use of firing squads. Amrozi preferred beheading. Despite an initial decision by Muklas, Amrozi and Imam Samudra to not seek a presidential pardon, on 21 August 2006, Muklas and his co-conspirators authorised their lawyers to file a last appeal which was lodged on 7 December on the basis of retroactive legislation. On 25 September 2008, the Supreme Court of Indonesia rejected the final appeals of Imam Samudra and Mukhlas; having dismissed Amrozi&#x27;s appeal earlier that month. In October 2008, he remained unrepentant and claimed revenge would be taken for his death. During the month, his final appeals were rejected and the Attorney General&#x27;s office announced that he would be executed by firing squad in early November 2008.

According to a source in Indonesia&#x27;s Attorney General Office, the executions were to be done before the end of Sunday, 9 November 2008. This was reportedly delayed from the original plan to allow a representative from the family to identify the body post-execution. From Amrozi&#x27;s family, his younger brother, Ali Fauzi was sent as a representative of his family.

Amrozi, along with Imam Samudra and Huda bin Abdul Haq, was executed by firing squad at 00:15 on 9 November 2008. Despite his carefree demeanor throughout his trial and incarceration, the Australian edition of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported Amrozi was pale-faced and shaking in the moments before his execution.

<doc id="291636" wikidata="Q158699" url="?curid=291636" title="Aglais io">
<text>Aglais io, the European peacock, or the peacock butterfly, is a colourful butterfly, found in Europe and temperate Asia as far east as Japan. The peacock butterfly is resident in much of its range, often wintering in buildings or trees. It therefore often appears quite early in spring.

The peacock butterfly has figured in research in which the role of eyespots as an anti-predator mechanism has been investigated. The peacock is expanding its range and is not known to be threatened.

==Characteristics==
The butterfly has a wingspan of . The base colour of the wings is a rusty red, and at each wingtip it bears a distinctive, black, blue and yellow eyespot. The underside is a cryptically coloured dark brown or black.

There are two subspecies: &quot;A. io caucasica&quot; (Jachontov, 1912), found in Azerbaijan, and &quot;A. io geisha&quot; (Stichel, 1908), found in Japan and the Russian Far East.
==Natural history==
The peacock can be found in woods, fields, meadows, pastures, parks, and gardens, from lowlands up to elevation. It is a relatively common butterfly, seen in many European parks and gardens. The peacock male exhibits territorial behaviour, in many cases territories being selected en route of the females to oviposition sites.

The butterfly hibernates over winter before laying its eggs in early spring, in batches of up to 400 at a time. The olive green eggs are ribbed. They are laid on both the upper parts and the undersides of leaves of nettle plants and hops. The caterpillars hatch after about a week. They are shiny black with six rows of barbed spikes and a series of white dots on each segment. The chrysalis may be either grey, brown or green, and may have a blackish tinge. The caterpillars grow up to in length.

The primary food plants of European peacock larvae are stinging nettle (&quot;Urtica dioica&quot;), hop (&quot;Humulus lupulus&quot;), and the small nettle (&quot;Urtica urens&quot;).

The adult butterflies drink nectar from a wide variety of flowering plants, including buddleia, willows, dandelions, wild marjoram, danewort, hemp agrimony, and clover; they also use tree sap and rotten fruits.

==Behaviour==

===Mating system and territorial behaviour===
&quot;Aglais io&quot; employs a monogamous mating system, which means that they only mate with one partner for a period of time. This is due to their life cycle in which females are receptive only during an eclosion period, after overwintering. The pairs only mate once after overwintering, as it is very difficult to find a receptive female after that period. In species where the range of the females is not defensible by a male, the males must defend a single desirable area that females will come through, such as dense food areas, watering holes, or favourable nesting sites. The males then attempt to mate with the females as they are passing through. 

Holding a desirable territory increases the male&#x27;s likelihood of finding a mate and therefore increases his reproductive success. However, each individual needs to weigh the benefits of mating with the costs of defending a territory. &quot;Aglais io&quot; exhibits this type of territorial behaviour, and must defend a desirable territory from other males. If only one of the males knows the territory well, he will successfully chase off any intruders. On the other hand, if both males are familiar with the territory, there will be a contest between the two to determine which of them stays in the territory. The most desirable sites are those that will increase the male&#x27;s quota of females. These sites are generally feeding and oviposition sites, which are sought after by females. This territorial behaviour is reinforced by the fact that these sites are all concentrated. If the valuable resources were dispersed, there would be less observable territorial behaviour. 

To find mates and defend their territory, &quot;Aglais io&quot; exhibits perching behaviour. The male butterflies will perch on an object at a specific height where they can observe passing flying objects. Every time they see a passing object of their own species or of a relevant species, they will fly straight towards the object until they are approximately 10 cm away. If they encounter a male, the resident male will chase him off his territory. If the resident male encounters a female, he will pursue her until she lands and mating will occur. The courtship is extended in this species. The male goes through a long chase before the female allows him to mate. He must demonstrate high performance flight.

The monandrous mating system has caused the evolution of a shorter life span in males of this species. In polygynous butterflies, the male&#x27;s reproductive success is largely dependent on life span. Therefore, the longer a male lives, the more he can reproduce, so he has a higher fitness. Therefore, males tend to live as long as the females. In &quot;A. io&quot; the synchronous eclosion at the end of winter cause males to only mate once. Their reproductive success is therefore not linked to how long they live, and there is no selective pressure to live longer. Therefore, the life span of males is shorter than the lifespan of the females.

===Anti-predator defense mechanisms===
Like many other butterflies that hibernate, the peacock butterfly exhibits many anti-predator defence mechanisms against would-be predators. The peacock butterfly&#x27;s most obvious defense comes from the four large eyespots that it has on its wings. It also uses camouflage and can emit a hissing sound.

The eyespots are brilliantly coloured concentric circles. Avian predators of the butterfly include blue tits, pied flycatchers and other small passerine birds. The first line of defence against these predators for many hibernating butterflies is crypsis, a process in which the butterflies blend into their environment by mimicking a leaf and staying immobile. Some hibernating butterflies such as the peacock have a second line of defence: when attacked, they open their wings and expose their eyespots in an intimidating threat display, which gives the butterfly a much better chance at escaping predators than butterflies that rely solely on leaf mimicry. While the main targets of these anti-predation measures are small passerine birds, even larger birds such as chickens have been shown to react to the stimuli and avoid the butterfly when exposed to eyespots.
====Avian predators====
Research has shown that avian predators attempting to attack a butterfly hesitate for a much longer time if they encounter butterflies that display their eyespots than if they encounter butterflies whose eyespots are covered. In addition, the predators delay their return to the butterfly if it displays eyespots and some predators even flee before attacking the butterfly. By intimidating the predator so that it delays or gives up its attack, the peacock butterfly has a much greater chance of escaping predation.

According to the eye mimicry hypothesis, the eyespots serve an anti-predatory purpose by imitating the eyes of the avian predators&#x27; natural enemies. In contrast, the conspicuousness hypothesis posits that rather than recognition of the eyespots as belonging to an enemy, the conspicuous nature of the eyespots, which are typically large and bright, causes a response in the visual system of the predator that leads to avoidance of the butterfly.

In one experiment, observed responses of the avian predators to the eyespots included increased vigilance, a delay in their return to the peacock butterfly, and the production of alarm calls associated with ground-based predators. These responses to the eyespot stimuli lend support to the eye mimicry hypothesis as they indicated that the avian predator sensed that the eyespots belonged to a potential enemy. When faced with avian predators like the blue tit, the peacock butterfly makes a hissing noise as well as threateningly displaying its eyespots. However, it is the eyespots that protect the butterfly the most; peacock butterflies that have had their sound production capability removed still defend themselves extremely well against avian predators if their eyespots are present.

====Rodent predators====
While hibernating in dark wintering areas, the peacock butterfly frequently encounters rodent predators such as small mice. Against these predators, however, the visual display of eyespots is ineffective due to the darkness of the environment. Instead, these rodent predators show a much stronger adverse reaction to the butterfly when it produces its auditory hissing signal. This indicates that for rodent predators, it is the auditory signal produced by the butterfly that serves as a deterrent.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Aglais io&quot; was formerly classified as the only member of the genus &quot;Inachis&quot; (the name is derived from Greek mythology, meaning Io, the daughter of Inachus). It should not be confused or classified with the &quot;American peacocks&quot; in the genus &quot;Anartia&quot;; while belonging to the same family as the European peacock, Nymphalidae, the American peacocks are not close relatives of the Eurasian species. 

Io is a figure in Greek mythology. She was a priestess of Hera in Argos.

<text>Field theory is the branch of mathematics in which fields are studied. This is a glossary of some terms of the subject. (See field theory (physics) for the unrelated field theories in physics.)

== Definition of a field ==
A field is a commutative ring in which and every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. In a field we thus can perform the operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The non-zero elements of a field &quot;F&quot; form an abelian group under multiplication; this group is typically denoted by &quot;F&quot;×;

The ring of polynomials in the variable &quot;x&quot; with coefficients in &quot;F&quot; is denoted by &quot;F&quot;[&quot;x&quot;].

== Basic definitions ==
; Characteristic : The &quot;characteristic&quot; of the field &quot;F&quot; is the smallest positive integer &quot;n&quot; such that ; here &quot;n&quot;·1 stands for &quot;n&quot; summands . If no such &quot;n&quot; exists, we say the characteristic is zero. Every non-zero characteristic is a prime number. For example, the rational numbers, the real numbers and the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers have characteristic 0, while the finite field Z&quot;p&quot; with &quot;p&quot; being prime has characteristic &quot;p&quot;.
; Subfield : A &quot;subfield&quot; of a field &quot;F&quot; is a subset of &quot;F&quot; which is closed under the field operation + and * of &quot;F&quot; and which, with these operations, forms itself a field.
; Prime field : The &quot;prime field&quot; of the field &quot;F&quot; is the unique smallest subfield of &quot;F&quot;.
; Extension field : If &quot;F&quot; is a subfield of &quot;E&quot; then &quot;E&quot; is an &quot;extension field&quot; of &quot;F&quot;. We then also say that &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; is a &quot;field extension&quot;.
; Degree of an extension : Given an extension &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot;, the field &quot;E&quot; can be considered as a vector space over the field &quot;F&quot;, and the dimension of this vector space is the &quot;degree&quot; of the extension, denoted by [&quot;E&quot; : &quot;F&quot;].
; Finite extension : A &quot;finite extension&quot; is a field extension whose degree is finite.
; Algebraic extension : If an element &quot;α&quot; of an extension field &quot;E&quot; over &quot;F&quot; is the root of a non-zero polynomial in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;x&quot;], then &quot;α&quot; is &quot;algebraic&quot; over &quot;F&quot;. If every element of &quot;E&quot; is algebraic over &quot;F&quot;, then &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; is an &quot;algebraic extension&quot;.
; Generating set : Given a field extension &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; and a subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;E&quot;, we write &quot;F&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) for the smallest subfield of &quot;E&quot; that contains both &quot;F&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. It consists of all the elements of &quot;E&quot; that can be obtained by repeatedly using the operations +, −, *, / on the elements of &quot;F&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. If , we say that &quot;E&quot; is generated by &quot;S&quot; over &quot;F&quot;.
; Primitive element : An element &quot;α&quot; of an extension field &quot;E&quot; over a field &quot;F&quot; is called a &quot;primitive element&quot; if &quot;E&quot;=&quot;F&quot;(&quot;α&quot;), the smallest extension field containing &quot;α&quot;. Such an extension is called a simple extension.
; Splitting field : A field extension generated by the complete factorisation of a polynomial.
; Normal extension : A field extension generated by the complete factorisation of a set of polynomials.
; Separable extension : An extension generated by roots of separable polynomials.
; Perfect field : A field such that every finite extension is separable. All fields of characteristic zero, and all finite fields, are perfect.
; Imperfect degree : Let &quot;F&quot; be a field of characteristic ; then &quot;F&quot;&quot;p&quot; is a subfield. The degree is called the &quot;imperfect degree&quot; of &quot;F&quot;. The field &quot;F&quot; is perfect if and only if its imperfect degree is &quot;1&quot;. For example, if &quot;F&quot; is a function field of &quot;n&quot; variables over a finite field of characteristic , then its imperfect degree is &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
; Algebraically closed field : A field &quot;F&quot; is &quot;algebraically closed&quot; if every polynomial in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] has a root in &quot;F&quot;; equivalently: every polynomial in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] is a product of linear factors.
; Algebraic closure: An &quot;algebraic closure&quot; of a field &quot;F&quot; is an algebraic extension of &quot;F&quot; which is algebraically closed. Every field has an algebraic closure, and it is unique up to an isomorphism that fixes &quot;F&quot;.
; Transcendental : Those elements of an extension field of &quot;F&quot; that are not algebraic over &quot;F&quot; are &quot;transcendental&quot; over &quot;F&quot;.
; Algebraically independent elements : Elements of an extension field of &quot;F&quot; are &quot;algebraically independent&quot; over &quot;F&quot; if they don&#x27;t satisfy any non-zero polynomial equation with coefficients in &quot;F&quot;.
; Transcendence degree : The number of algebraically independent transcendental elements in a field extension. It is used to define the dimension of an algebraic variety.

== Homomorphisms ==
; Field homomorphism : A &quot;field homomorphism&quot; between two fields &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is a ring homomorphism, i.e., a function
:: &quot;f&quot; : &quot;E&quot; → &quot;F&quot;
: such that, for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;E&quot;,
:: &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) + &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)
:: &quot;f&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)
:: &quot;f&quot;(1) = 1.
: For fields &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot;, these properties imply that , for &quot;x&quot; in &quot;E&quot;×, and that &quot;f&quot; is injective. Fields, together with these homomorphisms, form a category. Two fields &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are called isomorphic if there exists a bijective homomorphism
:: &quot;f&quot; : &quot;E&quot; → &quot;F&quot;.
: The two fields are then identical for all practical purposes; however, not necessarily in a &quot;unique&quot; way. See, for example, &quot;Complex conjugate&quot;.

== Field extensions ==
Let &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; be a field extension.
; Algebraic extension : An extension in which every element of &quot;E&quot; is algebraic over &quot;F&quot;.
; Simple extension: An extension which is generated by a single element, called a primitive element, or generating element. The primitive element theorem classifies such extensions.
; Normal extension : An extension that splits a family of polynomials: every root of the minimal polynomial of an element of &quot;E&quot; over &quot;F&quot; is also in &quot;E&quot;.
; Separable extension : An algebraic extension in which the minimal polynomial of every element of &quot;E&quot; over &quot;F&quot; is a separable polynomial, that is, has distinct roots.
; Galois extension : A normal, separable field extension.
; Primary extension : An extension &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; such that the algebraic closure of &quot;F&quot; in &quot;E&quot; is purely inseparable over &quot;F&quot;; equivalently, &quot;E&quot; is linearly disjoint from the separable closure of &quot;F&quot;.
; Purely transcendental extension : An extension &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; in which every element of &quot;E&quot; not in &quot;F&quot; is transcendental over &quot;F&quot;.
; Regular extension : An extension &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; such that &quot;E&quot; is separable over &quot;F&quot; and &quot;F&quot; is algebraically closed in &quot;E&quot;.
; Simple radical extension: A simple extension &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; generated by a single element &quot;α&quot; satisfying for an element &quot;b&quot; of &quot;F&quot;. In characteristic &quot;p&quot;, we also take an extension by a root of an Artin–Schreier polynomial to be a simple radical extension.
; Radical extension: A tower where each extension is a simple radical extension.
; Self-regular extension : An extension &quot;E&quot;/&quot;F&quot; such that is an integral domain.

:# If &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are C-extensions of &quot;K&quot; in a common overfield &quot;M&quot;, then the compositum &quot;EF&quot; is a C-extension of &quot;K&quot;.
:# If &quot;E&quot; is a C-extension of &quot;F&quot; and then &quot;E&quot; is a C-extension of &quot;K&quot;.

== Galois theory ==
; Galois extension : A normal, separable field extension.
; Galois group : The automorphism group of a Galois extension. When it is a finite extension, this is a finite group of order equal to the degree of the extension. Galois groups for infinite extensions are profinite groups.
; Kummer theory : The Galois theory of taking &quot;n&quot;th roots, given enough roots of unity. It includes the general theory of quadratic extensions.
; Artin–Schreier theory : Covers an exceptional case of Kummer theory, in characteristic &quot;p&quot;.
; Normal basis : A basis in the vector space sense of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot;, on which the Galois group of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;K&quot; acts transitively.
; Tensor product of fields : A different foundational piece of algebra, including the compositum operation (join of fields).

== Extensions of Galois theory ==
; Inverse problem of Galois theory : Given a group &quot;G&quot;, find an extension of the rational number or other field with &quot;G&quot; as Galois group.
; Differential Galois theory : The subject in which symmetry groups of differential equations are studied along the lines traditional in Galois theory. This is actually an old idea, and one of the motivations when Sophus Lie founded the theory of Lie groups. It has not, probably, reached definitive form.
; Grothendieck&#x27;s Galois theory : A very abstract approach from algebraic geometry, introduced to study the analogue of the fundamental group.
