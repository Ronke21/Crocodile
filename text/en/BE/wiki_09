<text>Charles Sumner (January 6, 1811March 11, 1874) was an American lawyer and politician who represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate from 1851 until his death in 1874. Before and during the American Civil War, he was a leading American advocate for the abolition of slavery. He chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1861 to 1871, until he lost the position following a dispute with President Ulysses S. Grant over the attempted annexation of Santo Domingo. After breaking with Grant, he joined the Liberal Republican Party, spending his final two years in the Senate alienated from his party. Sumner had a controversial and divisive legacy for many years after his death, but in recent decades, his historical reputation has improved in recognition of his early support for racial equality.

Sumner began his political activism as a member of various anti-slavery groups, leading to his election to the U.S. Senate in 1851 as a member of the Free Soil Party; he soon became a founding member of the Republican Party. In the Senate, he devoted his efforts to opposing the &quot;Slave Power,&quot; which in 1856 culminated in a vicious beating, almost to the point of death, by Representative Preston Brooks on the Senate floor. Sumner&#x27;s severe injuries and extended absence from the Senate made him a symbol of the anti-slavery cause. Though he did not return to the Senate until 1859, Massachusetts reelected him in 1857, leaving his empty desk as a reminder of the incident, which polarized the nation as the Civil War approached.

During the war, Sumner led the Radical Republican faction, which was critical of President Abraham Lincoln for being too moderate toward the South. As chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, Sumner worked to ensure that the United Kingdom and France did not intervene on behalf of the Confederate States. After the Union won the war and Lincoln was assassinated, Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens led congressional efforts to grant equal civil and voting rights to freedmen and to block ex-Confederates from power so they would not reverse the gains derived from the Union&#x27;s victory in the war. President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s persistent opposition to these efforts played a role in his impeachment in 1868.

During the Grant administration, Sumner fell out of favor with his party. He supported the annexation of Alaska but opposed Grant&#x27;s proposal to annex Santo Domingo. After leading senators to defeat the Santo Domingo Treaty in 1870, Sumner denounced him in such terms that reconciliation was impossible, and Senate Republicans stripped him of his power. Sumner opposed Grant&#x27;s 1872 reelection and supported Liberal Republican Horace Greeley. He died in office less than two years later.

==Early life, education, and law career==

Charles Sumner was born on Irving Street in Boston on January 6, 1811. His father, Charles Pinckney Sumner, was a Harvard-educated lawyer, abolitionist, and early proponent of racial integration of schools, who shocked 19th-century Boston by opposing anti-miscegenation laws. His mother, Relief Jacob, worked as a seamstress before marrying Charles.

Both of Sumner&#x27;s parents were born in poverty and were described as exceedingly formal and undemonstrative. His father served as Clerk of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1806 to 1807 and from 1810 to 1811, and he had a moderately successful legal practice. Throughout Sumner&#x27;s childhood, his family teetered on the edge of the middle class. Charles Pinckney Sumner hated slavery and told his son that freeing the slaves would &quot;do us no good&quot; unless society treated them equally. He was a close associate of Unitarian leader William Ellery Channing. Expanding on Channing&#x27;s argument that human beings had infinite potential to improve themselves, Sumner concluded that environment had &quot;an important, if not controlling influence&quot; in shaping people. Thus, if society gave precedence to &quot;knowledge, virtue and religion&quot;, then &quot;the most forlorn shall grow into forms of unimagined strength and beauty.&quot; Moral law, he believed, was as important for governments as it was for individuals, and legal institutions that inhibited personal progress—like slavery or segregation—were evil.

The family&#x27;s fortunes improved in 1825, when Charles Pinckney Sumner became Sheriff of Suffolk County; he held the position until his death in 1838. The family attended Trinity Church, but after 1825, they occupied a pew in King&#x27;s Chapel. Sumner&#x27;s father was also able to provide higher education for his children; the young Charles attended Boston Latin School, where he befriended Robert Charles Winthrop, James Freeman Clarke, Samuel Francis Smith, and Wendell Phillips. In 1830, he graduated from Harvard College, where he lived in Hollis Hall and was a member of the Porcellian Club. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he became a protégé of Joseph Story and an enthusiastic student of jurisprudence.

After graduating in 1834, Sumner was admitted to the bar and entered private practice in Boston in partnership with George Stillman Hillard. A visit to Washington decided him against a political career, and he returned to Boston resolved to practice law. He contributed to the quarterly &quot;American Jurist&quot; and edited Story&#x27;s court decisions as well as some law texts. From 1836 to 1837, Sumner lectured at Harvard Law School.

===Travels in Europe===
In 1837, Sumner visited Europe with financial support from benefactors, including Story and Congressman Richard Fletcher. He landed at Le Havre and found the cathedral at Rouen striking: &quot;The great lion of the north of France ... transcending all that my imagination had pictured.&quot; He reached Paris in December, studied French, and visited the Louvre. He mastered French within six months and attended lectures at the Sorbonne on subjects ranging from geology to Greek history to criminal law.

In his journal for January 20, 1838, Sumner noted that one lecturer &quot;had quite a large audience among whom I noticed two or three blacks, or rather mulattos—two-thirds black perhaps—dressed quite &quot;à la mode&quot; and having the easy, jaunty air of young men of fashion.&quot; They were &quot;well received&quot; by the other students after the lecture. He continued:

Sumner decided that Americans&#x27; predisposition to see blacks as inferior was a learned viewpoint, and he determined to become an abolitionist upon returning to America.

Over the next three years, Sumner became fluent in Spanish, German, and Italian, and met with many leading European statesmen. In 1838, he visited Britain, where Lord Brougham declared that he &quot;had never met with any man of Sumner&#x27;s age of such extensive legal knowledge and natural legal intellect&quot;. Though he often praised British society as more refined than American, Sumner published a fierce defense of the American position in the dispute over the Maine-Canada boundary, circulated by Minister to France Lewis Cass.

In 1840, at age 29, Sumner returned to Boston to practice law but devoted more time to lecturing at Harvard Law, editing court reports, and contributing to law journals, especially on historical and biographical themes.

Sumner developed friendships with several prominent Bostonians, particularly Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whose house he visited regularly in the 1840s. Longfellow&#x27;s daughters found his stateliness amusing; he would ceremoniously open doors for the children while saying &quot;In presequas&quot; (&quot;after you&quot;) in a sonorous tone.

==Early political activism==
Sumner embarked on a public political career in 1845, when he emerged as one of the most prominent critics of slavery in the city of Boston and the state of Massachusetts, a hotbed of abolitionist sentiment.

On July 4, Sumner delivered the Boston Independence Day oration, &quot;The True Grandeur of Nations&quot;. His speech was critical of the move toward war with Mexico and an impassioned appeal for freedom and peace. Sumner considered the conflict a war of aggression but was primarily concerned that captured territories would expand slavery westward. He soon became a sought-after orator for formal occasions throughout Boston. His lofty themes and stately eloquence made a profound impression. His platform presence was imposing. He stood tall, with a massive frame. His voice was clear and powerful. His gestures were unconventional, but vigorous and impressive. His literary style was florid, with much detail, allusion, and quotation, often from the Bible as well as the Greeks and Romans. Longfellow wrote that he delivered speeches &quot;like a cannoneer ramming down cartridges&quot;, while Sumner himself said that &quot;you might as well look for a joke in the Book of Revelation.&quot;

Following the annexation of Texas as a slave state in December, Sumner took an active role in the anti-slavery movement. In 1847, he denounced the declaration of war against Mexico with such vigor that he was recognized as a leader of the &quot;Conscience&quot; faction of the Massachusetts Whig Party. He declined the Whig nomination for the United States House of Representatives in 1848, instead helping organize the Free Soil Party and becoming chairman of the state party&#x27;s executive committee, a position he used to advocate for abolition and build a coalition that included anti-slavery Whigs and Democrats.

Sumner also took an active role in other social causes. He worked with Horace Mann to improve Massachusetts&#x27;s system of public education, advocated prison reform, and represented the plaintiffs in &quot;Roberts v. City of Boston&quot;, which challenged the legality of racial segregation in public schools. Arguing before the Massachusetts Supreme Court, Sumner noted that schools for blacks were physically inferior and that segregation bred harmful psychological and sociological effects—arguments made in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; over a century later. Sumner lost the case, but the Massachusetts General Court abolished school segregation in 1855.

==United States Senate (1851–1874)==
In 1851, a coalition of Democratic and Free Soil legislators gained control of the Massachusetts General Court. In exchange for Free Soil support for Democratic governor George Boutwell, the Free Soil Party named Sumner its choice for U.S. Senate. Despite the private agreement, conservative Democrats opposed his candidacy and called for a less radical candidate. The impasse was broken after three months and Sumner was elected on a parliamentary technicality by a one-vote majority on April 24, 1851, in part thanks to the support of Senate President Henry Wilson. His election marked a sharp break in Massachusetts politics, as his abolitionist politics contrasted sharply those of his best-known predecessor in the seat, Daniel Webster, one of the foremost supporters of the Compromise of 1850 and its Fugitive Slave Act.

For the first few sessions, Sumner did not promote any of his controversial causes. On August 26, 1852, he delivered his maiden speech, despite strenuous efforts to dissuade him. This oratorical effort incorporated a popular abolitionist motto, &quot;Freedom National; Slavery Sectional,&quot; as its title. In it, Sumner attacked the Fugitive Slave Act. Though both major party platforms affirmed every provision of the Compromise of 1850 as final, including the Fugitive Slave Act, Sumner called for its repeal. For more than three hours, he denounced it as a violation of the Constitution, an affront to the public conscience, and an offence against divine law. After his speech, a senator from Alabama urged that there be no reply: &quot;The ravings of a maniac may sometimes be dangerous, but the barking of a puppy never did any harm.&quot; Sumner&#x27;s outspoken opposition to slavery made him few friends in the Senate.

=== &quot;Crime against Kansas&quot; and beating by Preston Brooks ===

On May 19 and 20, 1856, during the civil unrest known as &quot;Bleeding Kansas,&quot; Sumner denounced the Kansas–Nebraska Act in his &quot;Crime against Kansas&quot; speech. The long speech argued for Kansas&#x27;s immediate admission as a free state and denounced &quot;Slave Power&quot;—the political power of the slave owners. Their motivation, he alleged, was to spread slavery even to free territories:

Sumner verbally attacked authors of the Act, Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and Andrew Butler of South Carolina:

On the afternoon of May 22, Representative Preston Brooks, Butler&#x27;s first cousin once removed, confronted Sumner in the Senate chamber and beat him severely on the head, using a thick gutta-percha cane with a gold head. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk, which was bolted to the floor. Blinded by his own blood, he staggered up the aisle and collapsed into unconsciousness. Brooks continued to beat the motionless Sumner until his cane broke, at which point he continued to strike Sumner with the remaining piece. Several other senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Laurence Keitt, who brandished a pistol and shouted, &quot;Let them be!&quot;

The episode became a symbol of polarization in the antebellum period; Sumner became a martyr in the North and Brooks a hero in the South. Thousands attended rallies in support of Sumner throughout the North. Louisa May Alcott described a rally in Boston on November 3 in a letter to Anna Alcott: Eight hundred gentlemen on horseback escorted him and formed a line up Beacon St. through which he rode smiling and bowing... The streets were lined with wreaths, flags, and loving people to welcome the good man back... I could not hear the speeches at the State House so I tore down Hancock St. and got a place opposite his house. I saw him go in, and soon after the cheers of the horsemen and crowd brought him smiling to the window, he only bowed, but when the leader of the cavelcade cried out &#x27;Three cheers for the mother of Charles Sumner!&#x27; he stepped back and soon appeared leading an old lady who nodded, waved her hand, put down the curtain, and then with a few dozen more cheers the crowd dispersed.

More than a million copies of Sumner&#x27;s &quot;Crime against Kansas&quot; speech were distributed. Ralph Waldo Emerson remarked, &quot;I do not see how a barbarous community and a civilised community can constitute one state. I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom.&quot; Conversely, Brooks was praised by Southern newspapers. The &quot;Richmond Enquirer&quot; editorialized that Sumner should be caned &quot;every morning&quot; and Southerners sent Brooks hundreds of new canes in endorsement of his assault. Southern lawmakers made rings out of the cane&#x27;s remains, which they wore on neck chains to show solidarity with Brooks.

Historian William Gienapp has concluded that Brooks&#x27;s &quot;assault was of critical importance in transforming the struggling Republican party into a major political force.&quot; Theological and legal scholar William R. Long characterized the speech as &quot;a most rebarbative and vituperative speech on the Senate floor&quot;, which &quot;flows with Latin quotations and references to English and Roman history.&quot; In his eyes, the speech was &quot;a gauntlet thrown down, a challenge to the &#x27;Slave Power&#x27; to admit once and for all that it were encircling the free states with their tentacular grip and gradually siphoning off the breath of democracy-loving citizens.&quot;
In addition to head trauma, Sumner suffered &quot;psychic wounds,&quot; now understood to be post-traumatic stress disorder. When he spent months convalescing, his political enemies ridiculed him and accused him of cowardice for not resuming his duties. The Massachusetts General Court reelected him in November 1856, believing that his vacant chair in the Senate chamber served as a powerful symbol of free speech and resistance to slavery.

When Sumner returned to the Senate in 1857, he was unable to last a day. His doctors advised a sea voyage and &quot;a complete separation from the cares and responsibilities that must beset him at home.&quot; He sailed for Europe and immediately found relief. During two months in Paris in the spring of 1857, he renewed friendships, especially with Thomas Gold Appleton, dined out frequently, and attended the opera. His contacts there included Alexis de Tocqueville, poet Alphonse de Lamartine, former French Prime Minister François Guizot, Ivan Turgenev, and Harriet Beecher Stowe. Sumner toured several countries, including Prussia and Scotland, before returning to Washington, where he spent only a few days in the Senate in December. Both then and during several later attempts to return to work, he found himself exhausted just listening to Senate business. He sailed once more for Europe on May 22, 1858, the second anniversary of Brooks&#x27;s attack.

In Paris, prominent physician Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard diagnosed Sumner&#x27;s condition as spinal cord damage that he could treat by burning the skin along the spinal cord. Sumner chose to refuse anaesthesia, which was thought to reduce the effectiveness of the procedure. Observers both at the time and since doubted Brown-Séquard&#x27;s efforts were of value. After spending weeks recovering from these treatments, Sumner resumed his touring, this time as far east as Dresden and Prague and south to Italy twice. In France he visited Brittany and Normandy, as well as Montpellier. He wrote his brother: &quot;If anyone cares to know how I am doing, you can say better and better.&quot;

In 1859, Sumner returned to the Senate permanently. Though fellow Republicans advised a less strident tone, he answered: &quot;When crime and criminals are thrust before us, they are to be met by all the energies that God has given us by argument, scorn, sarcasm and denunciation.&quot; He delivered his first return speech, &quot;The Barbarism of Slavery,&quot; on June 4, 1860. He attacked attempts to depict slavery as a benevolent institution, said it stifled economic development in the South, and that it left slaveholders reliant on &quot;the bludgeon, the revolver, and the bowie-knife&quot;. He addressed an anticipated objection on the part of one of his colleagues: &quot;Say, sir, in your madness, that you own the sun, the stars, the moon; but do not say that you own a man, endowed with a soul that shall live immortal, when sun and moon and stars have passed away.&quot; Even allies found his language too strong, one calling it &quot;harsh, vindictive, and slightly brutal&quot;. He spent the summer rallying the anti-slavery forces for the election of 1860 and opposing talk of compromise.

===Civil War===
After the Civil War began, Sumner was among the Radical Republicans who advocated immediate abolition of slavery and the destruction of the Southern planter class. Although like-minded on slavery, the Radicals were loosely organized and disagreed on issues such as the tariff and currency. Other Radicals in the Senate included Zachariah Chandler and Benjamin Wade. After the fall of Fort Sumter in April 1861, Sumner, Chandler and Wade repeatedly visited President Abraham Lincoln at the White House to discuss slavery and the rebellion. Gilbert Osofsky argues that Sumner saw the war as a &quot;death struggle&quot; between &quot;two mutually contradictory civilizations,&quot; and his solution was &quot;to &#x27;civilize&#x27; and &#x27;Americanize&#x27; the South&quot; by conquest, then forcibly mold it into a society defined in Northern terms, as an idealized version of New England.

Throughout the war, Sumner had been the special champion of black Americans, being the most vigorous advocate of emancipation, of enlisting blacks in the Union Army, and of the establishment of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau.

==== Emancipation ====
The Radicals desired the immediate emancipation of slaves and persistently lobbied for it as wartime policy, but Lincoln was resistant, since the slave states would be encouraged to join the Confederacy. Lincoln instead adopted a plan for gradual emancipation and compensation to slavers, but consulted Sumner frequently. Despite their disagreements, Lincoln called Sumner &quot;my idea of a bishop&quot; and an embodiment of the American people&#x27;s conscience.

In May 1861, Sumner counseled Lincoln to make emancipation the war&#x27;s primary objective. He believed that military necessity would eventually force Lincoln&#x27;s hand and that emancipation would give the Union higher moral standing, which would keep Britain from entering the Civil War on the Confederacy&#x27;s side. In October 1861, at the Massachusetts Republican Convention in Worcester, Sumner openly expressed his belief that slavery was the war&#x27;s sole cause and that the Union government&#x27;s primary objective was to end it. Sumner argued that Lincoln could command the Union Army to emancipate slaves under color of martial law. In the conservative press, Sumner&#x27;s speech was denounced as . Conservative Massachusetts newspapers editorialized that he was mentally ill and a &quot;candidate for the insane asylum,&quot; but the Radicals fully endorsed Sumner&#x27;s speech, and he continued to advance his argument publicly. As an intermediate measure, the Radicals passed two Confiscation Acts in 1861 and 1862 that allowed the military to emancipate confiscated slaves whom the Confederate military had impressed into service.

On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, abolishing slavery in all Confederate territory. The Thirteenth Amendment subsequently abolished the practice of chattel slavery.

==== Foreign relations ====

After the withdrawal of Southern senators, Sumner became chair of the Committee on Foreign Relations in March 1861. As chair, he renewed his efforts for diplomatic recognition of Haiti. Haiti had sought recognition since winning independence in 1804 but faced opposition from Southern senators. In their absence, the United States recognized Haiti in 1862.

On November 8, 1861, the Union Navy warship intercepted the British steamer . Two Confederate diplomats aboard were placed into port custody. In response to the capture, the British government dispatched 8,000 troops to the Canada–United States border and sought to strengthen the Royal Navy. Secretary of State William Seward believed the diplomats were contraband of war, but Sumner argued the men did not qualify as such because they were unarmed. He favored their release along with an apology from the U.S. government towards Britain. In the Senate, Sumner suppressed open debate in order to save the Lincoln administration from embarrassment. On December 25, 1861, at Lincoln&#x27;s invitation, Sumner addressed the cabinet. He read letters from prominent British political figures, including Richard Cobden, John Bright, William Ewart Gladstone, and the Duke of Argyll as evidence that political sentiment in Britain supported the envoys&#x27; return to the British. Lincoln quietly but reluctantly ordered the captives&#x27; release to British custody and apologized. After the &quot;Trent&quot; affair, Sumner&#x27;s reputation improved among conservative Northerners.

===Reconstruction and Civil rights===
As one of the Radical Republican leaders in the post-war Senate, Sumner fought to provide equal civil and voting rights for freedmen on the grounds that &quot;consent of the governed&quot; was a basic principle of American republicanism.

Sumner&#x27;s radical legal theory of Reconstruction proposed that nothing beyond the confines of the Constitution, read in light of the Declaration of Independence, restricted Congress&#x27;s treatment of the rebelling states. Though not as radical as Thaddeus Stevens, who considered the Confederate states &quot;conquered provinces,&quot; Sumner argued that by declaring secession, the state governments had committed &quot;felo de se&quot; (state suicide) and could be regulated as territories that should be prepared for statehood, under conditions set by the national government.

Sumner emerged as an idealist and a champion for civil rights through this turbulent and controversial period. He joined fellow Republicans in overriding President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s vetoes, though his most radical ideas were not implemented. Sumner favored partial male suffrage with a literacy requirement for all Southerners in order to vote. Instead, Congress imposed a loyalty requirement the following year; Sumner was strongly supportive.

Sumner was a friend of Samuel Gridley Howe and a guiding force for the American Freedmen&#x27;s Inquiry Commission, started in 1863. He was one of the most prominent advocates for suffrage for blacks, along with free homesteads and free public schools. His uncompromising attitude did not endear him to moderates, and his arrogance and inflexibility often inhibited his effectiveness as a legislator. He was largely excluded from work on the Thirteenth Amendment, in part because he did not get along with Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and did much of the work on it. Sumner introduced an alternative amendment that combined the Thirteenth Amendment with elements of the Fourteenth Amendment. It would have abolished slavery and declared that &quot;all people are equal before the law.&quot; During Reconstruction, he often attacked civil rights legislation as inadequate and fought for legislation to give land to freed slaves and to mandate education for all, regardless of race, in the South. He viewed segregation and slavery as two sides of the same coin. He introduced a civil rights bill in 1872 to mandate equal accommodation in all public places and required suits brought under the bill to be argued in the federal courts. The bill failed, but Sumner revived it in the next Congress, and on his deathbed begged visitors to see that it did not fail.

Sumner repeatedly tried to remove the word &quot;white&quot; from naturalization laws. He introduced bills to that effect in 1868 and 1869, but neither came to a vote. On July 2, 1870, Sumner moved to amend a pending bill in a way that would strike the word &quot;white&quot; wherever in all Congressional acts pertaining to naturalization of immigrants. On July 4, 1870, he said: Senators undertake to disturb us ... by reminding us of the possibility of large numbers swarming from China; but the answer to all this is very obvious and very simple. If the Chinese come here, they will come for citizenship or merely for labor. If they come for citizenship, then in this desire do they give a pledge of loyalty to our institutions; and where is the peril in such vows? They are peaceful and industrious; how can their citizenship be the occasion of solicitude? He accused legislators promoting anti-Chinese legislation of betraying the principles of the Declaration of Independence: &quot;Worse than any heathen or pagan abroad are those in our midst who are false to our institutions.&quot; Sumner&#x27;s bill failed, and from 1870 to 1943, and in some cases as late as 1952, Chinese and other Asians were ineligible for naturalized U.S. citizenship. Sumner remained a champion of civil rights for blacks. He co-authored the Civil Rights Act of 1875 with John Mercer Langston and introduced the bill in the Senate on May 13, 1870. The bill passed a year after his death, in February 1875, and President Grant signed it into law on March 1. It was the last civil rights legislation for 82 years until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. The Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1883 when it decided a group of cases known as the Civil Rights Cases.

When Johnson was impeached, Sumner voted for conviction at his trial. He was only sorry that he had to vote on each article of impeachment, for as he said, he would have rather voted, &quot;Guilty of all, and infinitely more.&quot;

====Alaska annexation====
Throughout March 1867, Secretary William H. Seward and Russian representative Edouard de Stoeckl met in Washington, D.C., and negotiated a treaty for the annexation and sale of the Russian American territory of Alaska to the United States for $7,200,000. President Johnson submitted the treaty to Congress for ratification with Sumner&#x27;s approval, and on April 9, his foreign relations committee approved and sent the treaty to the Senate. In a three-hour speech, Sumner spoke in favor of the treaty on the Senate floor, describing Alaska&#x27;s imperial history, natural resources, population, and climate. Sumner wanted to block British expansion from Canada, arguing that Alaska was geographically and financially strategic, especially for the Pacific Coast States. He said Alaska would increase America&#x27;s borders, spread republican institutions, and represent an act of friendship with Russia. The treaty won its needed two-thirds majority by one vote.

The 1867 treaty neither formally recognized, categorised, nor compensated any native Alaskan Eskimos or Indians, referring to them only as &quot;uncivilized tribes&quot; under the control of Congress. By federal law, Native Alaskan tribes, including the Inuit, the Aleut, and the Athabascan, were entitled only to land that they inhabited. According to treaty, native Alaskan tribes were excluded from U.S. citizenship, but citizenship was available to Russian residents. Creoles, persons of Russian and Indian descent, were considered Russian. Sumner said the new territory should be called by its Aleutian name, &quot;Alaska&quot;, meaning &quot;great land.&quot; He advocated for free public education and equal protection laws for U.S. citizens in Alaska.

Personal achievements in 1867 included his election as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

====CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; claims====

Sumner was well regarded in the United Kingdom, but after the war he sacrificed his reputation in the U.K. with his stand on U.S. claims for British breaches of neutrality. The U.S. had claims against Britain for the damage inflicted by Confederate raiding ships fitted out in British ports. Sumner held that since Britain had accorded the rights of belligerents to the Confederacy, it was responsible for extending the duration of the war and consequent losses. In 1869, he asserted that Britain should pay damages for not merely the raiders, but also &quot;that other damage, immense and infinite, caused by the prolongation of the war&quot;, specifically the British blockade runners, which were estimated to have given the Confederacy 60% of its weapons, 1/3 of the lead for its bullets, 3/4 ingredients for its powder, and most of the cloth for its uniforms; some historians believe that this may have lengthened the war by two years and cost 400,000 more lives of soldiers and civilians on both sides. He demanded $2,000,000,000 for these &quot;national claims&quot; in addition to $125,000,000 for damages from the raiders. Sumner did not expect that Britain ever would or could pay this sum, but he suggested that Britain turn over Canada as payment. This proposition offended many Britons, but was taken seriously by many Americans, including the Secretary of State, whose support for it nearly derailed the settlement with Great Britain in the months before the arbitration conference met at Geneva. At the Geneva arbitration conference in 1871, which settled U.S. claims against Britain, the panel of arbitrators refused to consider those &quot;national claims.&quot;

Sumner had some influence over J. Lothrop Motley, the U.S. ambassador to Britain, causing him to disregard the instructions of Secretary of State Hamilton Fish on the matter. This offended President Grant, but while it would be given as the official reason for Motley&#x27;s removal, was not really so pressing: the dismissal took place a year after Motley&#x27;s alleged misbehavior, and the real reason was an act of spite by Grant against Sumner.

====Dominican Republic annexation treaty====

In 1869, President Grant, in an expansionist plan, looked into the annexation of a Caribbean island country, the Dominican Republic, then known as Santo Domingo. Grant believed that the island&#x27;s mineral resources would be valuable to the United States, and that African Americans repressed in the South would have a safe haven to which to migrate. A labor shortage in the South would force Southerners to be tolerant toward African Americans. In July and November 1869, under Grant&#x27;s authority and with the State Department&#x27;s permission on the second trip, Orville Babcock, Grant&#x27;s private secretary, secretly negotiated a treaty with President Buenaventura Báez of the Dominican Republic. The initial treaty had not been authorized by the State Department, but the island nation was on the verge of a civil war between Báez and ex-President Marcos A. Cabral. Grant sent in the U.S. Navy to keep the Dominican Republic free from invasion and civil war while the treaty negotiations took place. This military action was controversial since the naval protection was unauthorized by Congress. The official treaty, drafted by Secretary of State Hamilton Fish in October 1869, annexed the Dominican Republic to the United States, gave eventual statehood, the lease of Samaná Bay for $150,000 yearly, and a $1,500,000 payment of the Dominican national debt. In January 1870, in order to gain support for the treaty, Grant visited Sumner&#x27;s Washington home and mistakenly believed that Sumner had consented to the treaty. Sumner said that he had only promised to give the treaty friendly consideration. This meeting led to bitter contention between Sumner and Grant. The treaty was formally submitted to the United States Senate on January 10, 1870.

Sumner, opposed to American imperialism in the Caribbean and fearful that annexation would lead to the conquest of the neighboring black republic of Haiti, became convinced that corruption lay behind the treaty, and that men close to Grant shared in the corruption. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he initially withheld his opinion on the treaty on January 18, 1870. Sumner had been leaked information from Assistant Secretary of State Bancroft Davis that U.S. Naval ships were being used to protect Báez. Sumner&#x27;s committee voted against annexation and, at Sumner&#x27;s suggestion and possibly to save the party from an ugly fight or Grant from embarrassment, the Senate debated the treaty behind closed doors in executive session. Grant persisted and sent messages to Congress in favor of annexation on March 14 and May 31, 1870. In closed session, Sumner spoke out against the treaty, warning that there would be difficulty with the foreign nationals, noting the chronic rebellion on the island and the risk that the independence of Haiti, recognized by the U.S. in 1862, would be lost. He said that Grant&#x27;s use of the U.S. Navy as a protectorate was a violation of international law and unconstitutional. Finally, on June 30, 1870, the treaty was voted on by the Senate and failed to gain the 2/3 majority required for passage.

The next day, Grant, feeling betrayed by Sumner, retaliated by ordering the dismissal of Sumner&#x27;s close friend John Lothrop Motley, Ambassador to Britain. By autumn, Sumner&#x27;s personal hostility to Grant was public knowledge, and he blamed the Secretary of State for failing to resign rather than let Grant have his way. The two men, friends until then, became bitter enemies. In December 1870, still fearful that Grant meant to acquire Santo Domingo somehow, Sumner gave a fiercely critical speech accusing him of usurpation and Babcock of unethical conduct. Already Grant, supported by Fish, had initiated a campaign to depose Sumner from the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Although Sumner said he was an &quot;Administration man,&quot; in addition to having stopped Grant&#x27;s Dominican Republic treaty attempt, Sumner had defeated Grant&#x27;s full repeal of the Tenure of Office Act, blocked Grant&#x27;s nomination of Alexander Stewart as Secretary of Treasury, and been a constant harassing force pushing Reconstruction policies faster than Grant had been willing to go. Grant also resented Sumner&#x27;s superior manner. Told that Sumner did not believe in the Bible, Grant supposedly said he was not surprised: &quot;He didn&#x27;t write it.&quot; As the rift between Grant and Sumner increased, Sumner&#x27;s health began to decline. When the 42nd U.S. Congress convened on March 4, 1871, senators affiliated with Grant, known as &quot;New Radicals&quot; voted to oust Sumner from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship.

===Liberal Republican revolt===
Sumner now turned against Grant. Like many other reformers, he decried the corruption in Grant&#x27;s administration. Sumner believed that the civil rights program he championed could not be carried through by a corrupt government. In 1872, he joined the Liberal Republican Party, which had been started by reformist Republicans such as Horace Greeley. The Liberal Republicans supported black suffrage, the three Reconstruction amendments, and the basic civil rights already protected by law, but also called for amnesty for ex-Confederates and decried the Republican governments in the South elected with the help of black votes, belittled the terrorism of the Ku Klux Klan, and argued that the time had come to restore &quot;home rule&quot; in the South, which in practical terms meant white Democratic rule. For Sumner&#x27;s civil rights bill they gave no support at all, but Sumner joined them because he had become convinced that the time had come for reconciliation, and that Democrats were sincere in declaring that they would abide by the Reconstruction settlement.
====Conciliation to South====
Sumner never saw his support for civil rights as hostile to the South. On the contrary, he had always contended that a guarantee of equality was the one condition essential for true reconciliation. Unlike some other Radical Republicans, he had strongly opposed any hanging or imprisonment of Confederate leaders. In December 1872, he introduced a Senate resolution providing that Civil War battle names should not appear as &quot;battle honors&quot; on the regimental flags of the U.S. Army. The proposal was not new: Sumner had offered a similar resolution on May 8, 1862, and in 1865 he had proposed that no painting hanging in the Capitol portray scenes from the Civil War, because, as he saw it, keeping alive the memories of a war between a people was barbarous. His proposal did not affect the vast majority of battle-flags, as nearly all the regiments that fought had been state regiments, and these were not covered. But Sumner&#x27;s idea was that any U.S. regiment that would in the future enlist Southerners as well as Northerners should not carry on its ensigns any insult to those who joined it. His resolution had no chance of passing, but its presentation offended Union army veterans. The Massachusetts legislature censured Sumner for giving &quot;an insult to the loyal soldiery of the nation&quot; and as &quot;meeting the unqualified condemnation of the people of the Commonwealth.&quot; Poet John Greenleaf Whittier led an effort to rescind that censure the following year. He succeeded early in 1874 with the help of abolitionist Joshua Bowen Smith, who was serving in the legislature that year. Sumner was able to hear the rescinding resolution presented to the Senate on the last day he was there. He died the next afternoon.

====&quot;Virginius&quot; Affair====
On October 30, 1873, the &quot;Virginius&quot;, a munitions and troop transportation ship supporting the Cuban Rebellion and flying the U.S. flag, was captured by Spanish authorities. After a hasty trial in Santiago, Cuba, Spain executed 53 crew members, including American and British citizens. Sumner sympathized with the Cuban rebels and those executed by Spain, but refused to support U.S. military intervention or the annexation of Cuba. On November 17, 1873, Sumner stated his views in an interview on the &quot;Virginius&quot; Affair at a local library in Boston. He believed that although the ship was flying a U.S. flag, its mission was illegal. Sumner, who opposed the Cuban insurgent neutrality of the Grant Administration, believed that the United States needed to support the First Spanish Republic. On November 28, 1873, Secretary of State Hamilton Fish, who coolly handled the incident amid national outcries for war, negotiated a peaceful settlement with Spanish President Emilio Castelar, and prevented war with Spain.

===Death===
Long ailing, Charles Sumner died of a heart attack at his home in Washington, D.C., on March 11, 1874, aged 63. He lay in state at the United States Capitol rotunda, the second senator (Henry Clay being the first, in 1852) and fourth person so honored. At his March 16 burial in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the pallbearers included Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and John Greenleaf Whittier.

In the aftermath, Mississippi Senator Lucius Lamar&#x27;s eulogy for Sumner was controversial enough considering his Southern heritage that the incident resulted in Lamar&#x27;s inclusion in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s book &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;.

==Historical interpretations==
Contemporaries and historians have explored Sumner&#x27;s personality and public career at length. Sumner&#x27;s reputation among historians in the first half of the 20th century was largely negative—he was particularly blamed by both the Dunning School and anti-Dunning revisionists for the excesses of Radical Reconstruction, which, in the prevailing scholarship, included letting Blacks vote and hold office. But as perceptions of Reconstruction changed in recent years, so too have perceptions of Sumner. Modern scholars have emphasized his role as a foremost champion of Black rights before, during, and after the Civil War; one historian says he was &quot;perhaps the least racist man in America in his day.&quot;

Sumner&#x27;s personality has also divided contemporaries and historians. Sumner&#x27;s friend Senator Carl Schurz praised Sumner&#x27;s integrity, his &quot;moral courage,&quot; the &quot;sincerity of his convictions,&quot; and the &quot;disinterestedness of his motives.&quot; But none of his friends at the time doubted his courage, and abolitionist Wendell Phillips, who knew Sumner well, remembered that southerners in the 1850s in Washington wondered, every time Sumner left his house in the morning, whether he would return alive. Just before he died, Sumner turned to his friend Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar. &quot;Judge,&quot; he said, &quot;tell Emerson how much I love and revere him.&quot; &quot;He said of you once,&quot; Hoar replied, &quot;that he never knew so white a soul.&quot;
Moorfield Storey, Sumner&#x27;s private secretary for two years and subsequent biographer, wrote of him:

Sumner&#x27;s biographer David Donald, a Southerner, presents Sumner in his Pulitzer Prize-winning first volume, &quot;Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War&quot; (1960), as an insufferably arrogant moralist; an egoist bloated with pride; pontifical and Olympian, and unable to distinguish between large issues and small ones. Donald concludes that Sumner was a coward who avoided confrontations with his many enemies, whom he routinely insulted in prepared speeches. But in Donald&#x27;s second volume, &quot;Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man&quot; (1970), he was much more favorable to Sumner, and though critical, recognized his large contribution to the positive accomplishments of Reconstruction.

Donald notes Sumner&#x27;s troubles in dealing with his colleagues:

Lawyer David O. Stewart said of him:Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote of Sumner:

===In popular culture===
In the 2012 film &quot;Lincoln&quot;, Sumner is portrayed by actor John Hutton.

In the 2013 film &quot;Saving Lincoln&quot;, Sumner was portrayed by Creed Bratton.

==Personal life==
Sumner was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1843. He served on the society&#x27;s board of councilors from 1852 to 1853, and later in life served as the society&#x27;s secretary of foreign correspondence from 1867 to 1874.

=== Marriage ===
Sumner was a bachelor for most of his life. In 1866, he began courting Alice Mason Hooper, the widowed daughter-in-law of Massachusetts Representative Samuel Hooper, and they married that October. Their marriage was unhappy. Sumner could not respond to his wife&#x27;s humor, and Alice had a ferocious temper. That winter, Alice began going out to public events with Prussian diplomat Friedrich von Holstein. This caused gossip in Washington, but Alice refused to stop seeing Holstein. When Holstein was recalled to Prussia in the spring of 1867, Alice accused Sumner of engineering the action, which Sumner denied. They separated the following September. Sumner&#x27;s enemies used the affair to attack Sumner&#x27;s manhood, calling him &quot;The Great Impotency.&quot; The situation depressed and embarrassed Sumner. He obtained an uncontested divorce on the grounds of desertion on May 10, 1873.

<doc id="273846" wikidata="Q3975914" url="?curid=273846" title="Strawberries (album)">
<text>Strawberries is the fifth studio album by English rock band the Damned. It was released in October 1982 by record label Bronze. Limited editions included a strawberry-scented lyric insert. The album reached No. 15 in the UK charts, the band&#x27;s first to reach the Top 20.

The record was released as the Damned were enjoying a higher public profile, thanks to the solo success of Captain Sensible. Sensible performed lead vocals on &quot;Life Goes On&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&quot;. He also introduced new instruments to the band, including sitar, and cello played by his then-girlfriend, Rachael Bor of the pop group Dolly Mixture.

== Background ==
While &quot;Strawberries&quot; was generally praised for its positive, up-beat melodies, the album marked a time of conflict and division within the band. During the recording, bassist Paul Gray fought with drummer Rat Scabies over management and song-writing responsibilities. Gray would leave the band in February 1983 (later replacing Billy Sheehan in UFO), and Bryn Merrick took over on bass. Keyboard player Roman Jugg officially became the Damned&#x27;s fifth band member. His arrival led to further experiments with the band&#x27;s sound, including loops and sampling. Jugg would later move to guitar, replacing Sensible, who left the band after the &quot;Strawberries&quot; concert tour.

In 1982 Robert Fripp of King Crimson joined the Damned in the studio during the recording of this album. However, the only track they recorded together, &quot;Fun Factory&quot;, was left off the album and did not receive any official release until 1990. Robert also joined the band on stage for a few songs on 11 October 1982 at the Hammersmith Odeon. A bootleg of this concert is available but is of low quality.

The album&#x27;s working title was &quot;Strawberries for Pigs&quot;, a name inspired by the reception the band&#x27;s newer music received from some of their older fans. As Vanian explained, &quot;we were playing a lot of new material, and we had an audience that didn&#x27;t want to hear about anything, they just wanted to hear &quot;Neat Neat Neat&quot; and &quot;New Rose,&quot; nothing else. And they wanted to just smash everything. And they weren&#x27;t interested in hearing music at all. So at one point, I turned around and said, &#x27;It&#x27;s like giving strawberries to a fucking pig, this gig, you know?&#x27; And that stuck in our minds, and we used it&quot;.

Vanian said that the song &quot;The Dog&quot; was inspired by Anne Rice&#x27;s &#x27;Interview With The Vampire&quot;, he explained &quot;On reading Anne Rice&#x27;s &#x27;interview with the Vampire&#x27; in 1976, I penned the song which became known as &#x27;The Dog&#x27; but was actually about the strange vampire child Claudia, described in Rice&#x27;s book. The idea of an adult&#x27;s mind trapped in a child&#x27;s body was too fascinating to resist.&quot;

As an easter egg, the band included various sounds at the end of different tracks, including an egg whisk and a pair of jeans being ripped. At the end of the track &quot;Bad Time for Bonzo&quot;, a sound of a flushing toilet was used.

Critics praised the album&#x27;s musicianship and 60s influences. Writing in &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Fred Dellar gave the album 9 out of 10: &quot;The Damned go totally melodic, offer harmony vocals, employ cellos, sitars and brass sections, and even remember to include a lyric sheet […] This is the kind of pop album Paul McCartney would be pleased to have his moniker on&quot;. 

In &quot;Sounds&quot;, Steve Keaton wrote that &quot;Strawberries is the Damned at their most melodic and subversive&quot;. He added that the album &quot;manages to indulge both Dave Vanian’s darkly obsessive Gothic vision and the good Captain&#x27;s psychedelic whims without sacrificing any hard rock sensibilities. &#x27;Strawberries&#x27; should be the LP to grant the Damned the recognition they&#x27;ve courted for so long&quot;.
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; described the album as &quot;eclectic and inconsistent but well-produced [...] and boasting some fine tunes [...], [&quot;Strawberries&quot;] shows Sensible&#x27;s increasing pop prominence [...] and Vanian&#x27;s willingness to explore a stylistic Pallette with no debt to punk&quot;. Other critics have noted the album&#x27;s embrace of psychedelic pop, as well as gothic rock.

In a negative contemporary review, &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;Strawberries&quot; &quot;a miserable (w)retch of a record, spewing fourth enough nauseous &#x27;nostalgia&#x27; to fill a book entitled &#x27;Why The Damned Never Made It&#x27;, without once touching any spirit. It seems they&#x27;re doomed to regurgitating their history &#x27;til the aftertaste becomes too bad to bear&quot;.

AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review was favourable: &quot;Recuperating a bit from &quot;The Black Album&quot;&#x27;s uneven impact while still aiming to try whatever they want in studio, [...] [&quot;Strawberries&quot; is] by turns sprightly and cheerful, dark and dramatic, energetic and snarling, or all that and more at once, [...] [and] defies usual expectations to be yet another good rock album from the band&quot;.

== Reissue ==
On 7 January 2005, Castle Records re-released &quot;Strawberries&quot; in the United Kingdom on CD. On October 7, 2022, Iconoclassic Records issued a 40th Anniversary 2 CD Edition of &quot;Strawberries&quot; remastered by Mark Wilder, including 15 bonus tracks and new liner notes by Jack Rabid of The Big Takeover.

<text>Clayman is the fifth studio album by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released via Nuclear Blast on 3 July 2000. It has a dark theme, with most of the lyrics dealing with depression and internal struggles. &quot;Clayman&quot; is the final In Flames album to feature their original melodic death metal sound. The band would later start to experiment with other styles on their next release, &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot;, gradually progressing these more experimental elements across their future releases later into the 2000s. Like on some songs on the previous album &quot;Colony&quot; the band tuned their guitars to drop A# on the songs &quot;Pinball Map&quot; and &quot;...As the Future Repeats Today&quot;.

The album&#x27;s cover art is based on Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; drawing. The Jester Head appears in the background, both on the cover, and in the album booklet itself. Music videos were produced for the songs &quot;Pinball Map&quot; (directed by Tamara Jordan) and &quot;Only for the Weak&quot;.

==Reception==
In 2005, &quot;Clayman&quot; was ranked No. 448 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2020, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 2000 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

In 2020, &quot;Bullet Ride&quot;, &quot;Pinball Map&quot;, &quot;Only for the Weak&quot;, and the title track were re-recorded for a 20th-anniversary edition of the album. Fan responses to the re-recordings have been mixed.

<doc id="273852" wikidata="Q1139873" url="?curid=273852" title="Whoracle">
<text>Whoracle is the third studio album by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released on 18 November 1997. The title of the album is a portmanteau of the English words &quot;whore&quot; and &quot;oracle&quot;.

Apart from &quot;Everything Counts&quot;, which is a cover of a Depeche Mode song, all songs were composed and arranged by In Flames. The lyrics were translated by &quot;Dark Tranquillity&quot; guitarist Niklas Sundin, after Anders Fridén had written them in Swedish.

&quot;Whoracle&quot; is the final album to feature Johan Larsson and Glenn Ljungström. It is also the last &quot;In Flames&quot; release with Björn Gelotte playing drums, as he permanently switched to lead guitar in future releases. Fredrik Nordström noted that it was not easy to record at times, since the band members usually preferred drinking beer and playing &quot;Tekken 3&quot;.

In 2020, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1997 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

== Concept ==
Whoracle is a concept album which describes the past, present, and a hypothetical future of the planet Earth. &quot;Jotun&quot; is a foreshadowing of the main concepts where a society is crushed and broken after an apocalyptic event. &quot;Episode 666&quot; seems to be the narration of this apocalyptic event which is, perversely, televised. The songs leading up to this tell a story of the rise and fall of a global society. &quot;The Hive&quot; and &quot;Jester Script Transfigured&quot; describe this technologically advanced society and a utopian world which is demolished by human nature in the next two songs. The inclusion of the Depeche Mode cover, &quot;Everything Counts&quot;, is a poignant way to imply that the people who built then destroyed their society realized their folly after it was too late.

<doc id="273854" wikidata="Q331839" url="?curid=273854" title="Telomerase">
<text>Telomerase, also called terminal transferase, is a ribonucleoprotein that adds a species-dependent telomere repeat sequence to the 3&#x27; end of telomeres. A telomere is a region of repetitive sequences at each end of the chromosomes of most eukaryotes. Telomeres protect the end of the chromosome from DNA damage or from fusion with neighbouring chromosomes. The fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; lacks telomerase, but instead uses retrotransposons to maintain telomeres.

Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase enzyme that carries its own RNA molecule (e.g., with the sequence 3′-CCCAAUCCC-5′ in &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot;) which is used as a template when it elongates telomeres. Telomerase is active in gametes and most cancer cells, but is normally absent in most somatic cells.

==History==
The existence of a compensatory mechanism for telomere shortening was first found by Soviet biologist Alexey Olovnikov in 1973, who also suggested the telomere hypothesis of aging and the telomere&#x27;s connections to cancer and perhaps some neurodegenerative diseases.

Telomerase in the ciliate &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; was discovered by Carol W. Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn in 1984. Together with Jack W. Szostak, Greider and Blackburn were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery. Later the cryo-EM structure of telomerase was first reported in &quot;T. thermophila&quot;, to be followed a few years later by the cryo-EM structure of telomerase in humans.

The role of telomeres and telomerase in cell aging and cancer was established by scientists at biotechnology company Geron with the cloning of the RNA and catalytic components of human telomerase and the development of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assay for telomerase activity called the TRAP assay, which surveys telomerase activity in multiple types of cancer.

The negative stain electron microscopy (EM) structures of human and &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; telomerases were characterized in 2013. Two years later, the first cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of telomerase holoenzyme (&quot;Tetrahymena&quot;) was determined. In 2018, the structure of human telomerase was determined through cryo-EM by UC Berkeley scientists.

==Human telomerase structure==

The molecular composition of the human telomerase complex was determined by Scott Cohen and his team at the Children&#x27;s Medical Research Institute (Sydney Australia) and consists of two molecules each of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), Telomerase RNA Component (TR or TERC), and dyskerin (DKC1). The genes of telomerase subunits, which include TERT, TERC, DKC1 and TEP1, are located on different chromosomes. The human TERT gene (hTERT) is translated into a protein of 1132 amino acids. TERT polypeptide folds with (and carries) TERC, a non-coding RNA (451 nucleotides long). TERT has a &#x27;mitten&#x27; structure that allows it to wrap around the chromosome to add single-stranded telomere repeats.

TERT is a reverse transcriptase, which is a class of enzymes that creates single-stranded DNA using single-stranded RNA as a template.

The protein consists of four conserved domains (RNA-Binding Domain (TRBD), fingers, palm and thumb), organized into a &quot;right hand&quot; ring configuration that shares common features with retroviral reverse transcriptases, viral RNA replicases and bacteriophage B-family DNA polymerases.

TERT proteins from many eukaryotes have been sequenced.

==Mechanism==
The shelterin protein TPP1 is both necessary and sufficient to recruit the telomerase enzyme to telomeres, and is the only shelterin protein in direct contact with telomerase.

By using TERC, TERT can add a six-nucleotide repeating sequence, 5&#x27;-TTAGGG (in vertebrates; the sequence differs in other organisms) to the 3&#x27; strand of chromosomes. These TTAGGG repeats (with their various protein binding partners) are called telomeres. The template region of TERC is 3&#x27;-CAAUCCCAAUC-5&#x27;.

Telomerase can bind the first few nucleotides of the template to the last telomere sequence on the chromosome, add a new telomere repeat (5&#x27;-GGTTAG-3&#x27;) sequence, let go, realign the new 3&#x27;-end of telomere to the template, and repeat the process. Telomerase reverses telomere shortening.

==Clinical implications==

===Aging===
Telomerase restores short bits of DNA known as telomeres, which are otherwise shortened after repeated division of a cell via mitosis.

In normal circumstances, where telomerase is absent, if a cell divides recursively, at some point the progeny reach their Hayflick limit, which is believed to be between 50 and 70 cell divisions. At the limit the cells become senescent and cell division stops. Telomerase allows each offspring to replace the lost bit of DNA, allowing the cell line to divide without ever reaching the limit. This same unbounded growth is a feature of cancerous growth.

Embryonic stem cells express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed only in cells that need to divide regularly, especially in male sperm cells, but also in epidermal cells, in activated T cell and B cell lymphocytes, as well as in certain adult stem cells, but in the great majority of cases somatic cells do not express telomerase.

A comparative biology study of mammalian telomeres indicated that telomere length of some mammalian species correlates inversely, rather than directly, with lifespan, and concluded that the contribution of telomere length to lifespan is unresolved. Telomere shortening does not occur with age in some postmitotic tissues, such as in the rat brain. In humans, skeletal muscle telomere lengths remain stable from ages 23 –74. In baboon skeletal muscle, which consists of fully differentiated postmitotic cells, less than 3% of myonuclei contain damaged telomeres and this percentage does not increase with age. Thus, telomere shortening does not appear to be a major factor in the aging of the differentiated cells of brain or skeletal muscle. In human liver, cholangiocytes and hepatocytes show no age-related telomere shortening. Another study found little evidence that, in humans, telomere length is a significant biomarker of normal aging with respect to important cognitive and physical abilities.

Some experiments have raised questions on whether telomerase can be used as an anti-aging therapy, namely, the fact that mice with elevated levels of telomerase have higher cancer incidence and hence do not live longer. On the other hand, one study showed that activating telomerase in cancer-resistant mice by overexpressing its catalytic subunit extended lifespan. A study found that long-lived subjects inherited a hyperactive version of telomerase.

====Premature aging====
Premature aging syndromes including Werner syndrome, Progeria, Ataxia telangiectasia, Ataxia-telangiectasia like disorder, Bloom syndrome, Fanconi anemia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome are associated with short telomeres. However, the genes that have mutated in these diseases all have roles in the repair of DNA damage and the increased DNA damage may, itself, be a factor in the premature aging (see DNA damage theory of aging). An additional role in maintaining telomere length is an active area of investigation.

===Cancer===
&quot;In vitro,&quot; when cells approach the Hayflick limit, the time to senescence can be extended by inactivating the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Retinoblastoma protein (pRb). Cells that have been so-altered eventually undergo an event termed a &quot;crisis&quot; when the majority of the cells in the culture die. Sometimes, a cell does not stop dividing once it reaches a crisis. In a typical situation, the telomeres are shortened and chromosomal integrity declines with every subsequent cell division. Exposed chromosome ends are interpreted as double-stranded breaks (DSB) in DNA; such damage is usually repaired by reattaching the broken ends together. When the cell does this due to telomere-shortening, the ends of different chromosomes can be attached to each other. This solves the problem of lacking telomeres, but during cell division anaphase, the fused chromosomes are randomly ripped apart, causing many mutations and chromosomal abnormalities. As this process continues, the cell&#x27;s genome becomes unstable. Eventually, either fatal damage is done to the cell&#x27;s chromosomes (killing it via apoptosis), or an additional mutation that activates telomerase occurs.

With telomerase activation some types of cells and their offspring become immortal (bypass the Hayflick limit), thus avoiding cell death as long as the conditions for their duplication are met. Many cancer cells are considered &#x27;immortal&#x27; because telomerase activity allows them to live much longer than any other somatic cell, which, combined with uncontrollable cell proliferation is why they can form tumors. A good example of immortal cancer cells is HeLa cells, which have been used in laboratories as a model cell line since 1951.

While this method of modelling human cancer in cell culture is effective and has been used for many years by scientists, it is also very imprecise. The exact changes that allow for the formation of the tumorigenic clones in the above-described experiment are not clear. Scientists addressed this question by the serial introduction of multiple mutations present in a variety of human cancers. This has led to the identification of mutation combinations that form tumorigenic cells in a variety of cell types. While the combination varies by cell type, the following alterations are required in all cases: TERT activation, loss of p53 pathway function, loss of pRb pathway function, activation of the Ras or myc proto-oncogenes, and aberration of the Protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A). That is to say, the cell has an activated telomerase, eliminating the process of death by chromosome instability or loss, absence of apoptosis-induction pathways, and continued mitosis activation.

This model of cancer in cell culture accurately describes the role of telomerase in actual human tumors. Telomerase activation has been observed in ~90% of all human tumors, suggesting that the immortality conferred by telomerase plays a key role in cancer development. Of the tumors without TERT activation, most employ a separate pathway to maintain telomere length termed Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT). The presence of this alternative pathway was first described in an SV40 virus-transformed human cell line, and based on the dynamics of the changes in telomere length, was proposed to result through recombination. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear.

Elizabeth Blackburn &quot;et al.&quot;, identified the upregulation of 70 genes known or suspected in cancer growth and spread through the body, and the activation of glycolysis, which enables cancer cells to rapidly use sugar to facilitate their programmed growth rate (roughly the growth rate of a fetus).

Approaches to controlling telomerase and telomeres for cancer therapy include gene therapy, immunotherapy, small-molecule and signal pathway inhibitors.

====Drugs====
The ability to maintain functional telomeres may be one mechanism that allows cancer cells to grow &quot;in vitro&quot; for decades. Telomerase activity is necessary to preserve many cancer types and is inactive in somatic cells, creating the possibility that telomerase inhibition could selectively repress cancer cell growth with minimal side effects. If a drug can inhibit telomerase in cancer cells, the telomeres of successive generations will progressively shorten, limiting tumor growth.

Telomerase is a good biomarker for cancer detection because most human cancer cells express high levels of it. Telomerase activity can be identified by its catalytic protein domain (hTERT). is the rate-limiting step in telomerase activity. It is associated with many cancer types. Various cancer cells and fibroblasts transformed with hTERT cDNA have high telomerase activity, while somatic cells do not. Cells testing positive for hTERT have positive nuclear signals. Epithelial stem cell tissue and its early daughter cells are the only noncancerous cells in which hTERT can be detected. Since hTERT expression is dependent only on the number of tumor cells within a sample, the amount of hTERT indicates the severity of cancer.

The expression of hTERT can also be used to distinguish benign tumors from malignant tumors. Malignant tumors have higher hTERT expression than benign tumors. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) quantifying hTERT expression in various tumor samples verified this varying expression.

The lack of telomerase does not affect cell growth until the telomeres are short enough to cause cells to &quot;die or undergo growth arrest&quot;. However, inhibiting telomerase alone is not enough to destroy large tumors. It must be combined with surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

Cells may reduce their telomere length by only 50-252 base pairs per cell division, which can lead to a long lag phase.

A telomerase activator TA-65 is commercially available and is claimed to delay aging and to provide relief from certain disease conditions. This formulation contains a molecule called cycloastragenol derived from a legume Astragalus membranaceus. Several other compounds have been found to increase telomerase activity: Centella asiatica extract 8.8-fold, oleanolic acid 5.9-fold, astragalus extract 4.3-fold, TA-65 2.2-fold, and maslinic acid 2-fold.

====Immunotherapy====

Immunotherapy successfully treats some kinds of cancer, such as melanoma. This treatment involves manipulating a human&#x27;s immune system to destroy cancerous cells. Humans have two major antigen identifying lymphocytes: CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) and CD4+ helper T-lymphocytes that can destroy cells. Antigen receptors on CTL can bind to a 9-10 amino acid chain that is presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) as in Figure 4. HTERT is a potential target antigen. Immunotargeting should result in relatively few side effects since hTERT expression is associated only with telomerase and is not essential in almost all somatic cells. GV1001 uses this pathway. Experimental drug and vaccine therapies targeting active telomerase have been tested in mouse models, and clinical trials have begun. One drug, imetelstat, is being clinically researched as a means of interfering with telomerase in cancer cells. Most of the harmful cancer-related effects of telomerase are dependent on an intact RNA template. Cancer stem cells that use an alternative method of telomere maintenance are still killed when telomerase&#x27;s RNA template is blocked or damaged.

====Telomerase Vaccines====
Two telomerase vaccines have been developed: GRNVAC1 and GV1001. GRNVAC1 isolates dendritic cells and the RNA that codes for the telomerase protein and puts them back into the patient to make cytotoxic T cells that kill the telomerase-active cells. GV1001 is a peptide from the active site of hTERT and is recognized by the immune system that reacts by killing the telomerase-active cells.

====Targeted apoptosis====

Another independent approach is to use oligoadenylated anti-telomerase antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes to target telomerase RNA, leading to the dissociation of the RNA and to apoptosis (Figure 5). The fast induction of apoptosis through antisense binding may be a good alternative to the slower telomere shortening.

==== Small interfering RNA (siRNA) ====
siRNAs are small RNA molecules that induce the sequence-specific degradation of other RNAs. siRNA treatment can function similar to traditional gene therapy by destroying the mRNA products of particular genes, and therefore preventing the expression of those genes. A 2012 study found that targeting TERC with an siRNA reduced telomerase activity by more than 50% and resulted in decreased viability of immortal cancer cells. Treatment with both the siRNA and radiation caused a greater reduction in tumor size in mice than treatment with radiation alone, suggesting that targeting telomerase could be a way to increase the efficacy of radiation in treating radiation-resistant tumors.

===Heart disease, diabetes and quality of life===

Blackburn also discovered that mothers caring for very sick children have shorter telomeres when they report that their emotional stress is at a maximum and that telomerase was active at the site of blockages in coronary artery tissue, possibly accelerating heart attacks.

In 2009, it was shown that the amount of telomerase activity significantly increased following psychological stress. Across the sample of patients telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells increased by 18% one hour after the end of the stress.

A study in 2010 found that there was &quot;significantly greater&quot; telomerase activity in participants than controls after a three-month meditation retreat.

Telomerase deficiency has been linked to diabetes mellitus and impaired insulin secretion in mice, due to loss of pancreatic insulin-producing cells.

===Rare human diseases===
Mutations in TERT have been implicated in predisposing patients to aplastic anemia, a disorder in which the bone marrow fails to produce blood cells, in 2005.

Cri du chat syndrome (CdCS) is a complex disorder involving the loss of the distal portion of the short arm of chromosome 5. TERT is located in the deleted region, and loss of one copy of TERT has been suggested as a cause or contributing factor of this disease.

Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a disease of the bone marrow that can be caused by some mutations in the telomerase subunits. In the DC cases, about 35% cases are X-linked-recessive on the DKC1 locus and 5% cases are autosomal dominant on the TERT and TERC loci.

Patients with DC have severe bone marrow failure manifesting as abnormal skin pigmentation, leucoplakia (a white thickening of the oral mucosa) and nail dystrophy, as well as a variety of other symptoms. Individuals with either TERC or DKC1 mutations have shorter telomeres and defective telomerase activity &quot;in vitro&quot; versus other individuals of the same age.

In one family autosomal dominant DC was linked to a heterozygous TERT mutation. These patients also exhibited an increased rate of telomere-shortening, and genetic anticipation (i.e., the DC phenotype worsened with each generation).

<text>In sociology, an industrial society is a society driven by the use of technology and machinery to enable mass production, supporting a large population with a high capacity for division of labour. Such a structure developed in the Western world in the period of time following the Industrial Revolution, and replaced the agrarian societies of the pre-modern, pre-industrial age. Industrial societies are generally mass societies, and may be succeeded by an information society. They are often contrasted with traditional societies.

Industrial societies use external energy sources, such as fossil fuels, to increase the rate and scale of production. The production of food is shifted to large commercial farms where the products of industry, such as combine harvesters and fossil fuel–based fertilizers, are used to decrease required human labor while increasing production. No longer needed for the production of food, excess labor is moved into these factories where mechanization is utilized to further increase efficiency. As populations grow, and mechanization is further refined, often to the level of automation, many workers shift to expanding service industries.

Industrial society makes urbanization desirable, in part so that workers can be closer to centers of production, and the service industry can provide labor to workers and those that benefit financially from them, in exchange for a piece of production profits with which they can buy goods. This leads to the rise of very large cities and surrounding suburb areas with a high rate of economic activity.

These urban centers require the input of external energy sources in order to overcome the diminishing returns of agricultural consolidation, due partially to the lack of nearby arable land, associated transportation and storage costs, and are otherwise unsustainable. This makes the reliable availability of the needed energy resources high priority in industrial government policies.

== Industrial development ==

Prior to the Industrial Revolution in Europe and North America, followed by further industrialization throughout the world in the 20th century, most economies were largely agrarian. Basics were often made within the household and most other manufacturing was carried out in smaller workshops by artisans with limited specialization or machinery.

In Europe during the late Middle Ages, artisans in many towns formed guilds to self-regulate their trades and collectively pursue their business interests. Economic historian Sheilagh Ogilvie has suggested the guilds further restrained the quality and productivity of manufacturing. There is some evidence, however, that even in ancient times, large economies such as the Roman Empire or Chinese Han dynasty had developed factories for more centralized production in certain industries.

With the Industrial Revolution, the manufacturing sector became a major part of European and North American economies, both in terms of labor and production, contributing possibly a third of all economic activity. Along with rapid advances in technology, such as steam power and mass steel production, the new manufacturing drastically reconfigured previously mercantile and feudal economies. Even today, industrial manufacturing is significant to many developed and semi-developed economies.

== Deindustrialisation ==

Historically certain manufacturing industries have gone into a decline due to various economic factors, including the development of replacement technology or the loss of competitive advantage. An example of the former is the decline in carriage manufacturing when the automobile was mass-produced.

A recent trend has been the migration of prosperous, industrialized nations towards a post-industrial society. This has come with a major shift in labor and production away from manufacturing and towards the service sector, a process dubbed &quot;tertiarization&quot;. Additionally, since the late 20th century, rapid changes in communication and information technology (sometimes called an information revolution) have allowed sections of some economies to specialize in a quaternary sector of knowledge and information-based services. For these and other reasons, in a post-industrial society, manufacturers can and often do relocate their industrial operations to lower-cost regions in a process known as off-shoring.

Measurements of manufacturing industries outputs and economic effect are not historically stable. Traditionally, success has been measured in the number of jobs created. The reduced number of employees in the manufacturing sector has been assumed to result from a decline in the competitiveness of the sector, or the introduction of the lean manufacturing process.

Related to this change is the upgrading of the quality of the product being manufactured. While it is possible to produce a low-technology product with low-skill labour, the ability to manufacture high-technology products well is dependent on a highly skilled staff.

== Industrial policy ==

Today, as industry is an important part of most societies and nations, many governments will have at least some role in planning and regulating industry. This can include issues such as industrial pollution, financing, vocational education, and labour law.

== Industrial labour ==

In an industrial society, industry employs a major part of the population. This occurs typically in the manufacturing sector. A labour union is an organization of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals in key areas such as wages, hours, and other working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of other union members and negotiates labour contracts with employers. This movement first rose among industrial workers.

== Effects on slavery ==
Ancient Mediterranean cultures relied on slavery throughout their economy. While serfdom largely supplanted the practice in Europe during the Middle Ages, several European powers reintroduced slavery extensively in the early modern period, particularly for the harshest labor in their colonies. The Industrial revolution played a central role in the later abolition of slavery, partly because domestic manufacturing&#x27;s new economic dominance undercut interests in the slave trade.
Additionally, the new industrial methods required a complex division of labor with less worker supervision, which may have been incompatible with forced labor.

== War ==
The Industrial Revolution changed warfare, with mass-produced weaponry and supplies, machine-powered transportation, mobilization, the total war concept and weapons of mass destruction. Early instances of industrial warfare were the Crimean War and the American Civil War, but its full potential showed during the world wars. See also military-industrial complex, arms industries, military industry and modern warfare.

== Use in 20th century social science and politics ==
“Industrial society” took on a more specific meaning after World War II in the context of the Cold War, the internationalization of sociology through organizations like UNESCO, and the spread of American industrial relations to Europe. The cementation of the Soviet Union’s position as a world power inspired reflection on whether the sociological association of highly-developed industrial economies with capitalism required updating. The transformation of capitalist societies in Europe and the United States to state-managed, regulated welfare capitalism, often with significant sectors of nationalized industry, also contributed to the impression that they might be evolving beyond capitalism, or toward some sort of “convergence” common to all “types” of industrial societies, whether capitalist or communist. State management, automation, bureaucracy, institutionalized collective bargaining, and the rise of the tertiary sector were taken as common markers of industrial society. 

The “industrial society” paradigm of the 1950s and 1960s was strongly marked by the unprecedented economic growth in Europe and the United States after World War II, and drew heavily on the work of economists like Colin Clark, John Kenneth Galbraith, W.W. Rostow, and Jean Fourastié. The fusion of sociology with development economics gave the industrial society paradigm strong resemblances to modernization theory, which achieved major influence in social science in the context of postwar decolonization and the development of post-colonial states.

The French sociologist Raymond Aron, who gave the most developed definition to the concept of “industrial society” in the 1950s, used the term as a comparative method to identify common features of the Western capitalist and Soviet-style communist societies. Other sociologists, including Daniel Bell, Reinhard Bendix, Ralf Dahrendorf, Georges Friedmann, Seymour Martin Lipset, and Alain Touraine, used similar ideas in their own work, though with sometimes very different definitions and emphases. The principal notions of industrial-society theory were also commonly expressed in the ideas of reformists in European social-democratic parties who advocated a turn away from Marxism and an end to revolutionary politics.

Because of its association with non-Marxist modernization theory and American anticommunist organizations like the Congress for Cultural Freedom, “industrial society” theory was often criticized by left-wing sociologists and Communists as a liberal ideology that aimed to justify the postwar status quo and undermine opposition to capitalism. However, some left-wing thinkers like André Gorz, Serge Mallet, Herbert Marcuse, and the Frankfurt School used aspects of industrial society theory in their critiques of capitalism.

<text>Colony is the fourth studio album by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released on 21 May 1999 via Nuclear Blast Records.

It is the first &quot;In Flames&quot; album to feature the band&#x27;s classic line-up; Björn Gelotte switched to lead guitar, to replace Glenn Ljungström, and Daniel Svensson filled the drummer position left vacant by Gelotte. Peter Iwers became the new bass player, replacing Johan Larsson. With Anders Fridén and Jesper Strömblad remaining on vocals and rhythm guitar respectively, this lineup remained unchanged until 2010.

In 2021, it was named one of the 20 best metal albums of 1999 by &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine.

==Music==
===Lyrics and musical style===
The album deals with various aspects of religion, society, and spirituality, from the somewhat positive light of &quot;Embody the Invisible&quot; and &quot;The New Word&quot;, to the more negative &quot;Zombie Inc.&quot; and &quot;Scorn&quot;. Colony features a faster, tighter, and more energetic approach to the music than displayed on the previous album, &quot;Whoracle&quot;, though the song-writing approach is similar.

===Songs===
The title of the song &quot;The New Word&quot; is subject to debate. According to the track list on the back cover of the original 1999 release, the official In Flames web site, and the lyrics printed in the original 1999 CD booklet, the correct title is &quot;The New Word&quot;; however, according to the heading of the lyrics printed for the song in the original booklet, the track list on the 2004 re-release, and the official Nuclear Blast Records web site, the song is called &quot;The New World&quot;. The 2009 re-release &quot;Colony: Reloaded&quot; did nothing to clear up this issue, with the insert and the booklet containing the same inconsistency as the original 1999 release. The song&#x27;s lyrics themselves, meanwhile, suggest that &quot;The New Word&quot; is indeed the correct title.

&quot;Pallar Anders Visa&quot; is a cover of the Swedish folk song &quot;Pallars-Anders visa&quot; which can be roughly translated as &quot;song of Anders the thief&quot;. It is also an instrumental, just like the bonus track, &quot;Man Made God&quot;. The guitarist Bjorn Gelotte talked about it in an interview:
It&#x27;s an old Swedish traditional song. Really old. &quot;Pallar Anders&quot; is a name, but it means &quot;Anders, the guy who steals apples&quot; and it&#x27;s his song. I don&#x27;t know how to translate it.

The song &quot;Embody the Invisible&quot; appears in the soundtrack for the 2003 video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;.

The tracks &quot;Behind Space &#x27;99&quot; and &quot;Clad in Shadows &#x27;99&quot; (which are only available on different issues of this album) are both remakes of the tracks first heard on &quot;Lunar Strain&quot;, although &quot;Behind Space &#x27;99&quot; excludes the acoustic guitar outro present on the original version.

This would be the first time the band would down tune their guitars from C standard on previous album with &quot;Ordinary Story&quot; and &quot;Colony&quot; being tuned to drop A#, something they would continue on future albums.

==Track listing==

=== Deluxe edition (2004) ===
Contains the following, in addition to the standard track listing along with the instrumental &quot;Man Made God&quot;:

* Photo gallery
* &quot;Ordinary Story&quot; music video 
* Computer wallpapers
* A screensaver
* Winamp skins
* Song lyrics 

=== &quot;Colony: Reloaded&quot; (2009) ===
The enhanced re-release contains the same bonus content as the 2004 deluxe edition. The original 1999 cover is brought back, and the back insert is custom-shaped to fit into the &quot;Super Jewel Box&quot; case that is used.

<text>Nuclear Blast Records is a German record label with subsidiaries in Germany, the United States and Brazil. It was founded in 1987 by Markus Staiger in Donzdorf. Originally releasing hardcore punk records, the label moved on to releasing albums by thrash metal, melodic death metal, grindcore, industrial metal, power metal and black metal bands, as well as tribute albums. It also distributes and promotes post-hardcore/metalcore labels SharpTone Records; another post-hardcore/metalcore label, Arising Empire, was in Nuclear Blast portfolio until its acquirement by Kontor New Media in 2020.

In October 2018, French independent label Believe Digital acquired a majority stake in Nuclear Blast.

== History ==

Nuclear Blast was formed in 1987 after founder Markus Staiger traveled throughout the United States for four weeks and saw a gig of his favorite band BL&#x27;AST!. The label&#x27;s first release was a vinyl compilation called &quot;Senseless Death&quot; (NB 001) featuring US hardcore bands like Attitude, Sacred Denial, Impulse Manslaughter and others.

Swedish band Meshuggah became the first band in the history of Nuclear Blast Records to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, landing at number 165 with their 2002 album, &quot;Nothing&quot;. Meshuggah also became the first Nuclear Blast band to be reviewed in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

In 2004, Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish released &quot;Once&quot; on Nuclear Blast, which rocketed to the top of the charts in multiple countries, including Finland, Germany, Norway, Greece, Sweden, Austria, and more. It became the first release in the company&#x27;s history to reach number 1 on the German charts. Slayer released the album &quot;Repentless&quot; in 2015 which went to number 4 on the Billboard 200 making it the highest charting Nuclear Blast release in the United States.

During the 2000s and 2010s, Nuclear Blast signed many veteran thrash metal bands including Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Anthrax, Kreator, Overkill, Sepultura, Destruction, Tankard, Death Angel, and Heathen.

In 2021, Nuclear Blast founder Markus Staiger launched a new record company called Atomic Fire GmbH.

In June 2022, Nuclear Blast unveiled a new logo. The logo caused some controversy when the canned water company Liquid Death jokingly noted its similarities with their logo (which also features a melting skull), inadvertedly leading to its designer, Justin Moll, receiving hate mail. Liquid Death quickly apologized for the joke, saying that it was not targeted at Moll but at Nuclear Blast, whose personnel had reportedly raised concerns over the new logo&#x27;s similarities with Liquid Death&#x27;s before it was implemented.

On 23 August 2022, the video game &quot;Saints Row&quot; was released, which features an in-game radio station that includes Nuclear Blast artists.

== Blood Blast Distribution ==
Blood Blast Distribution is a subsidiary of Nuclear Blast that focuses solely on the distribution of extreme music. The company was founded in 2020 by Bryce Lucien, Jerome Riera, Denis Ladegaillerie and Myriam Silberstein.

<text>Reroute to Remain (subtitled: Fourteen Songs of Conscious Insanity, and on reissue: Fourteen Songs of Conscious Madness) is the sixth studio album by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released in September 2002.

The album saw a major change in musical style and was met with rejection among many of the band&#x27;s fanbase. The album&#x27;s more accessible sound attracted many new fans and popularized In Flames&#x27; name within the American heavy metal scene, helping to secure a top spot at Ozzfest. It was the band&#x27;s first album to present singles: &quot;Trigger&quot; and &quot;Cloud Connected&quot;. The band would continue to use guitars tuned to Drop A# on this album with some songs tuned to C standard, excepting &quot;Transparent&quot;, which was tuned down to Drop G.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Despite initially receiving a mixed response from fans, the album received mostly favorable reviews. In 2005, &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot; was ranked number 326 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

===Charts===
The album peaked at No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums chart.

==Track listing==
All music is composed by Björn Gelotte, Jesper Strömblad and Anders Fridén. All lyrics are written by Anders Fridén, except where noted.

<text>Ulrich Beck (15 May 1944 – 1 January 2015) was a German sociologist, and one of the most cited social scientists in the world during his lifetime. His work focused on questions of uncontrollability, ignorance and uncertainty in the modern age, and he coined the terms &quot;risk society&quot; and &quot;second modernity&quot; or &quot;reflexive modernization&quot;. He also tried to overturn national perspectives that predominated in sociological investigations with a cosmopolitanism that acknowledges the interconnectedness of the modern world. He was a professor at the University of Munich and also held appointments at the &quot;Fondation Maison des Sciences de l’Homme&quot; (FMSH) in Paris, and at the London School of Economics.

==Life==

Beck was born in the Pomeranian town of Stolp, Germany (now Słupsk in Poland), in 1944, and grew up in Hanover. He began university studies with a focus on law at Freiburg, and from 1966 onwards studied sociology, philosophy, psychology and political science at the University of Munich. Starting in 1972, after earning a doctorate, he was employed at Munich as a sociologist. In 1979 he qualified as a university lecturer with a habilitation thesis. He received appointments as professor at the universities of Münster (1979–1981) and Bamberg (1981–1992). From 1992 until his death, Beck was professor of sociology and director of the Institute for Sociology at the University of Munich. He received numerous international awards and honors, including election to the Council and Executive Board of the German Society for Sociology.

From 1995 to 1997 he was a member of the &quot;Kommission für Zukunftsfragen der Freistaaten Bayern und Sachsen&quot; (Bavarian and Saxon State Commission for Questions Concerning the Future). Beginning in 1999, he was the speaker of the DFG research programme on reflexive modernity.

From 1999 to 2009 Beck was a spokesman of the Collaborative Reflexive Modernization Research Centre 536, an interdisciplinary consortium of four universities in the Munich area funded and overseen by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Beck&#x27;s theory of interdisciplinary reflexive modernization on a basis of a wide range of topics in appropriate research was empirically tested. The theory of reflexive modernization works from the basic idea that the rise of the modern industrial age produces side-effects across the globe that provide the institutional basis and coordinates that modern nation-states question, modify, and open for political action.

He was active as sociologist and public intellectual in Germany and throughout the world, regularly intervening in debates on the European Union, climate change and nuclear energy. At the time of his death, he and his international research group were only 1.5 years into the 5-year research project &quot;Methodological Cosmopolitanism – in the Laboratory of Climate Change&quot; (the Cosmo-Climate Research Project), of which Beck was the Principal investigator. For this research project he received the prestigious ERC Advanced Grant, scheduled to terminate in 2018. Along with Beck, sociologists David Tyfield and Anders Blok lead work packages within the overall project. The project also fostered international research collaboration with various research &#x27;hubs&#x27; in East Asia through the Europe-Asia Research Network (EARN). In cooperation with EARN, Beck and sociologist Sang-Jin Han had been set to lead a 2-year project for the Seoul Metropolitan Government beginning in 2015.

Beck was a member of the Board of Trustees at the Jewish Center in Munich and a member of the German branch of PEN International.

He was married to the German social scientist Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim. He died of a myocardial infarction on 1 January 2015, at the age of 70.

==Research contributions==
For 25 years, Beck delivered new diagnoses to the following question: How can social and political thought and action in the face of radical global change (environmental destruction, financial crisis, global warming, the crisis of democracy and the nation-state institutions) be intertwined in a new modernity? A radicalized modernity, for Beck, attacks its own foundations. Institutions such as the nation-state and the family are globalized &#x27;from the inside&#x27;.

Beck studied modernization, ecological problems, individualization and globalization. Later in his career, he embarked on exploring the changing conditions of work in a world of increasing global capitalism, declining influence of unions and flexibilisation of the labour process, a then new theory rooted in the concept of cosmopolitanism. Beck also contributed a number of new words to German and anglophone sociology, including &quot;risk society&quot;, &quot;second modernity&quot;, reflexive modernization and Brazilianization (Brasilianisierung). According to Beck, all contemporary political thinking emanates from the methodological nationalism of political thought and sociology (and other social sciences).

 Risk society was coined by Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens during the 1980s. According to Beck and Giddens, the traditional industrial class structure of modern society is breaking apart. Globalization creates risks that concern people from all different classes; for example, radioactivity, pollution, and even unemployment. Affluent households act to insulate themselves from these risks, but cannot do so for some; for example global environmental change. The poor suffer them. He points out that risks are also socially constructed and some risks are perceived as more dangerous because they are discussed in mass media more frequently, such as terrorism. Risk society leads to analysis of risks, causing prejudgment.

Beck was the editor of the sociological journal, &quot;&quot; (in German, since 1980), author of some 150 articles, and author or editor of many books.

==The Spinelli Group==
On 15 September 2010, Beck supported the European Parliament&#x27;s Spinelli Group initiative to reinvigorate federalism in the European Union. The Union of European Federalists and its youth organisation Young European Federalists have been promoting the idea of European federalism for over 60 years, with a &quot;belief that only a European Federation, based on the idea of unity in diversity, could overcome the division of the European continent&quot;. Prominent supporters of the initiative include Jacques Delors, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Guy Verhofstadt, Andrew Duff and Elmar Brok.

<text>The Affenpinscher () is a German breed of small toy dog of Pinscher type. Originally developed as a mouser, the Affenpinscher is now commonly found as a companion worldwide.

== History ==

The word &quot; derives from , German for &#x27;ape&#x27; or &#x27;monkey&#x27;; it is sometimes translated as &#x27;Monkey Terrier&#x27;, although the dog is a pinscher and not a terrier.

The origins of the Pinscher group of dogs are unknown. Dogs of this type, both rough-haired and smooth-haired, were traditionally kept as carriage dogs or as stable dogs, and so were sometimes known as ; they were capable ratters. Until the late nineteenth century, both rough-haired and smooth-haired types were known as Deutscher Pinscher, and came from the same lineage; puppies of both types could occur in the same litter.

In 1880 the Pinscher was recorded in the &quot;Deutschen Hundestammbuch&quot; of the Verein zur Veredelung der Hunderassen. In 1895 described five varieties of Pinscher – the rough- and smooth-haired Pinscher, the rough- and smooth-haired Miniature Pinscher, and the Affenpinscher. In 1895 a breed society, the Pinscher-Schnauzer-Klub, was established for both types, both rough- and smooth-haired.

Dogs of the Affenpinscher type have been known since about 1600. There were originally thought to be two sizes, the larger size is now extinct. The larger size was approximately , and came in colors of grey, fawn, black, tan, and red. White feet and chests were also common. The breed was created to be a ratter in homes, working to remove rodents from kitchens, and also granaries and stables. Early breeders crossed the various schnauzers and pinschers with the goal to create a mouser who also was a good companion dog. Some of the breeds that may have been included to produce the Affenpinscher are pugs, German pinschers, schnauzers and silky pinschers.

The breed predates and is ancestral to the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon) and Miniature Schnauzer which was thought to be from affenpinschers crossed with standard schnauzers in addition to other breeds. The breed was recognized by the AKC in 1935 and the FCI in 1955.

Banana Joe V Tani Kazari, Joe, a five-year-old Affenpinscher, was named Best in Show at the 2013 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in New York City.

==Description==
===Appearance===
An Affenpinscher generally weighs and stands tall at the withers. It has a harsh rough coat when it is not clipped, but if clipped it can be softer and fluffier. It has a notable monkey-like expression (&quot;affe&quot; is German for monkey). Its coat is shaggier over the head and shoulders, forming a mane, with a shorter coat over the back and hind quarters. It is harsh and wiry in texture when properly maintained. The FCI and British Kennel Club breed standards specify that the coat must be black, but the American Kennel Club also allows grey, silver, red, black and tan, and beige (a mixture of red, brown, black and white hairs).

=== Temperament ===
Affenpinschers have a distinct appearance that some associate with terriers. However, they are part of &quot;Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers&quot; in the FCI classification, and not the terrier group. They are active, adventurous, curious, and stubborn, but they are also fun-loving and playful. The breed is confident, lively, affectionate towards family members and is also protective of them.

Affenpinschers are somewhat territorial when it comes to their toys and food, so they are not recommended for homes with young children. This dog is mostly quiet, but it can become excited if attacked or threatened and shows no fear toward any aggressor.

==Health==
A UK study found a life expectancy of 9.3 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds

The Affenpinscher is prone to hip dysplasia. As with many small breeds of dog, they are prone to collapsed trachea and luxating patella. Some are prone to fractures, PDA, open fontanel and respiratory problems in hot weather. Ocular conditions such as cataracts are occasionally reported. An emerging concern is syringomyelia, although the incidence is currently unknown.

Affenpinscher bitches are more prone to seasonal flank alopecia, which seems to affect them during the winter.

<doc id="273887" wikidata="Q945101" url="?curid=273887" title="From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah">
<text>From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah is a live album by American rock band Nirvana, released on October 1, 1996 by DGC Records. It features live performances recorded from 1989 to 1994.

Compiled largely by bassist Krist Novoselic, it was released two years after the multi-platinum-selling live album, &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;, which was the first Nirvana album to be released after the suicide of the band&#x27;s songwriter, singer and guitarist, Kurt Cobain, in April 1994. &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; was intended to show the band&#x27;s heavier side, in contrast to the acoustic &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album, and was originally meant to be packaged alongside the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; set in a double album called &quot;Verse Chorus Verse&quot;, although most of what became &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; was eventually recompiled.

The album debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling nearly 159,000 copies in its first week of release. It spent 25 weeks on the chart and became the band&#x27;s sixth platinum album in the US since 1991. The album&#x27;s first promotional single, for the song &quot;Aneurysm,&quot; reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number 13 on its Modern Rock Tracks chart, while its music video topped the charts on &quot;Much Music&quot; in Canada. A second promotional single, for the song &quot;Drain You,&quot; charted briefly as well.

&quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; was ranked ninth best album of 1996 in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; 1997 critics&#x27; poll.

==Background==

&quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; was the second Nirvana album released following the death of vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain in April 1994. It was compiled primarily by bassist Krist Novoselic, who also wrote the album&#x27;s liner notes. Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl had originally intended to release a live album in 1994 to accompany what became &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot; in a two-disc set originally titled &quot;Verse Chorus Verse&quot; (which had also been a working title for the band&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;In Utero&quot;, as well as the title of two Nirvana songs). However, Novoselic and Grohl reportedly had a difficult time working on the album so soon after Cobain&#x27;s death, and the album was compiled, but never mixed. The original track list featured several songs not present on &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot;—&quot;Serve the Servants&quot;, &quot;Dive&quot;, &quot;Rape Me&quot;, &quot;Sappy&quot; and &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;—and different versions of the overlapping songs, other than &quot;Negative Creep&quot; and &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot;.

The album&#x27;s title refers to the Wishkah River in Aberdeen, Washington, where Cobain claimed to have spent nights sleeping under the Young Street Bridge as a teenager (as referenced in the song &quot;Something in the Way&quot;, from &quot;Nevermind&quot;). This claim has since been refuted by Novoselic, who said, &quot;He never lived under that bridge. He hung out there, but you couldn&#x27;t live on those muddy banks, with the tide coming up and down. That was his own revisionism.&quot;

==Performances used==

&quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; avoids all songs that appear on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, with the exception of &quot;Polly&quot;, using a heavier, electric version of the song from 1989, as it was originally performed live. It also avoids using any versions of songs previously released as B-sides, or on the home video &quot;Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!&quot;, which had been compiled by Cobain, and was released in unfinished form in November 1994.
===London Astoria===

&quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; uses three tracks from the band&#x27;s show at the London Astoria on December 3, 1989, including &quot;Intro,&quot; which features Cobain screaming at the start of the show over a distorted guitar as a vocal warm-up. It also uses &quot;Polly&quot; and &quot;Breed,&quot; the latter of which then featured the working title &quot;Imodium&quot;, and a slower tempo than the version of the song which eventually appeared on &quot;Nevermind&quot;. These songs mark the only appearance of Chad Channing, the band&#x27;s drummer from 1988 to 1990, on the compilation.

The London Astoria show was praised by the British music press at the time, with the &quot;NME&quot; calling the band &quot;Sub Pop&#x27;s answer to The Beatles&quot;.

===Paramount Theatre===

Only one song, &quot;Negative Creep,&quot; appears from the band&#x27;s performance at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle on October 31, 1991, although the vinyl version features additional stage banter from this show on side four. The Paramount concert was the band&#x27;s first performance in Seattle since the release of &quot;Nevermind&quot; the previous month, and has retrospectively been described by English music journalist Everett True as &quot;the end of an era&quot; that showed that &quot;incontrovertibly, Nirvana was now big news&quot;. 

&quot;Negative Creep&quot; became the eighth song from the show to be officially released, after &quot;Drain You,&quot; &quot;School&quot; and &quot;Been a Son&quot; appeared as &quot;Nevermind&quot; b-sides in 1991 and 1992, and &quot;About a Girl,&quot; &quot;Breed,&quot; &quot;Polly&quot; and &quot;&quot;Endless, Nameless&quot; appeared on &quot;Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!&quot;. The full show was released as &quot;Live at the Paramount&quot; on DVD in 2011, and on vinyl in 2019.

===Teatro Castello===

The version of &quot;Spank Thru&quot; which appears on the album was taken from the band&#x27;s show at Teatro Castello in Rome, Italy on November 19, 1991. Although the show was professionally filmed and recorded, &quot;Spank Thru&quot; remains the only song from this concert to be officially released.

===Paradiso===

Nirvana were originally scheduled to play at the Melkweg in Amsterdam on November 24, 1991, but due to the band&#x27;s increasing popularity, the show was rescheduled to a night later at the larger Paradiso in Amsterdam. The versions of &quot;School,&quot; &quot;Lithium,&quot; &quot;Been a Son&quot; and &quot;Blew&quot; on the compilation are all taken from this show.

As with the Paramount show, several other songs from the Paradiso concert appeared on &quot;Live! Tonight!! Sold Out!!&quot;. The full show was released in November 2021 on CD and Blu-Ray on the 30th anniversary &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; version of &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

===Del Mar Fairgrounds===

The versions of &quot;Drain You,&quot; &quot;Aneurysm&quot; and &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; from the compilation are taken from the band&#x27;s show at the Del Mar Fairgrounds in Del Mar, California, on December 28, 1991. The show was part of a four-date Californian mini-tour in late December with American rock bands Red Hot Chili Peppers, who headlined, and Pearl Jam, who were the first openers. Describing the tour in his 1993 Nirvana biography &quot;Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot;, American music journalist Michael Azerrad wrote that &quot;No one was happy about Nirvana playing second fiddle to the Peppers, but they had already committed to it during the chaos of the American tour. At any rate, Nirvana stole the show.&quot;

The full show was released in November 2021 on the 30th anniversary &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; version of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, which featured the complete concert on CD.

===Reading Festival===

Only one song, &quot;tourette&#x27;s,&quot; appears from the band&#x27;s headlining set on August 30, 1992 at the annual Reading Festival in Reading, England. The song, which later appeared on &quot;In Utero&quot;, was introduced by Cobain under its working title of &quot;The Eagle Has Landed.&quot;

&quot;tourette&#x27;s&quot; became the second song from the concert to be officially released, following &quot;Lithium&quot; on &quot;Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!&quot; The full concert was released as &quot;Live at Reading&quot; on CD and DVD in November 2009.

===Springfield Civic Center===

&quot;Sliver&quot; is taken from the band&#x27;s show at the Springfield Civic Center, Springfield on November 10, 1993. The vinyl version of the album also features additional stage banter from this concert, as well as a brief clip of band performing &quot;Dumb&quot; before stopping it after Cobain accidentally repeats the second verse instead of playing the bridge. These represent the earliest appearance, chronologically, of second guitarist Pat Smear on the album. &quot;Milk It&quot; from this show was released on the 30th anniversary Deluxe and Super Deluxe editions of the &quot;In Utero&quot; album in October 2023.

===&quot;Live and Loud&quot;===

&quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot; is taken from the band&#x27;s &quot;Live and Loud&quot; show, which was filmed by MTV on December 13, 1993 at Pier 48 in Seattle. An abridged version of the show, which included &quot;Scentless Apprentice,&quot; was first broadcast by the network on December 31, 1993. 

The show was set to feature Pearl Jam and Nirvana as co-headliners, but the former band cancelled shortly before the performance, which led to Nirvana playing a longer set. The concert featured American hip-hop act Cypress Hill and American alternative rock band The Breeders as supporting acts. Nirvana&#x27;s full set was released as &quot;Live and Loud&quot; on DVD in 2013, and on vinyl in 2019.

===The Forum===

&quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; is taken from a show, which benefitted the non-profit media watch organization Fairness &amp; Accuracy in Reporting, at The Forum in Los Angeles, on December 30, 1993. At that show Cobain also dedicated a song to the recently deceased River Phoenix. The vinyl version features additional stage banter from this show. &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot; from this show appeared on a bootleg in 2002. The band reportedly played to an audience of about 13,000. The full show was released on the 30th anniversary Super Deluxe edition of the &quot;In Utero&quot; album in October 2023.

===Seattle Center Arena===

&quot;Milk It&quot; is the only performance from 1994, taken from the band&#x27;s show at the Seattle Center Arena on January 7, 1994. The vinyl version features additional stage banter from this show, including a clip of Cobain dedicating a song to recently deceased celebrities Frank Zappa, River Phoenix, Fred Gwynne, Dixie Lee Ray and Tip O&#x27;Neil, along with &quot;you dumb ass who just threw water on me.&quot; &quot;Serve the Servants&quot; from this show was included on the abandoned &quot;Verse Chorus Verse&quot; album. The full show was released on the 30th anniversary Super Deluxe edition of the &quot;In Utero&quot; album in October 2023.

==Release and reception==

&quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; became Nirvana&#x27;s third consecutive album to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, and fourth to top the chart overall.

No commercial singles were released from the album, but promotional singles were sent out for radio play for a number of the songs, including &quot;Aneurysm&quot; (US and UK), &quot;Drain You&quot; (US), &quot;Lithium&quot; (Portugal and the Netherlands), and &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; (France, Portugal and Spain where it charted at number 14 on the Spanish airplay chart). A limited edition promotional box set was also released in Australia containing three promotional singles for the songs &quot;Aneurysm&quot;, &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;, and &quot;Polly&quot;. The box set also included &quot;Nevermind It&#x27;s an Interview&quot;, a promotional interview disc released in 1992.

===Critical reception===

Lorraine Ali of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; as the &quot;emotional, visceral flip side&quot; of &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;, and as &quot;riotous and liberating&quot;, showing the band &quot;in their most natural state, smashing instruments and inducing irreversible tinnitus.&quot; Johnny Cigarettes of the &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;a gloriously electrifying aural photo-book of a truly legendary rock’n’roll band, the like of which burns across our skies all too rarely in this sterile, cynical and safely post-modern age.&quot;

The album was ranked at number nine in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 1997 critics&#x27; poll of the top 10 albums of 1996, and number 14 in &quot;Spin&quot;″s &quot;20 Best Albums of 1996&quot; list.

===Legacy===

In his &quot;Allmusic&quot; review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the compilation &quot;a little scattershot&quot; but &quot;still a terrific record&quot; which &quot;finds a great band in top form.&quot; American music critic Robert Christgau wrote, &quot;I play &quot;Unplugged&quot; to refresh my memory of a sojourner&#x27;s spirituality. I&#x27;ll play this one when I want to remember a band&#x27;s guts, fury, and rock and roll music&quot;; Tim Peacock of &quot;uDiscover&quot; called the album &quot;the formidable yang to the subtle, acoustic yin of &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;,&quot; and praised the selections from the band&#x27;s &quot;scintillating&quot; Paradiso and &quot;transcendent&quot; Del Mar Fairgrounds shows in particular.

Keith Cameron welcomed the compilation&#x27;s emphasis on the &quot;positive...versions of &#x27;Polly&#x27; and &#x27;Breed&#x27; from the Lamefest gig at London&#x27;s Astoria in December 1989, [the night] Nirvana opened for Mudhoney and Tad at a two-thirds empty theatre, [and] served notice that they were the band destined to redirect the gaze of the pop world onto a town called Seattle.&quot;

&quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; described the 1996 documentary &quot;Teen Spirit: The Tribute to Kurt Cobain&quot; as the &quot;video scrapbook companion to Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; LP&quot;.

<text>The Serpentine (also known as the Serpentine River) is a recreational lake in Hyde Park, London, England, created in 1730 at the behest of Queen Caroline. Although it is common to refer to the entire body of water as the Serpentine, the name refers in the strict sense only to the eastern half of the lake. Serpentine Bridge, which marks the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, also marks the Serpentine&#x27;s western boundary; the long and narrow western half of the lake is known as the Long Water. The Serpentine takes its name from its snakelike, curving shape, although it only has one bend.

Originally fed by the River Westbourne and Tyburn Brook in the 1730s, the lake&#x27;s water was then pumped from the Thames in the 1830s. The water is now pumped from three boreholes within Hyde Park, the most recent being installed in May 2012 as part of the 2011–2012 restoration of the lake. The Serpentine provided a focal point for The Great Exhibition of 1851, and more recently was a venue for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s triathlon and marathon swimming events in the London 2012 Olympics. Since 1864, the Serpentine Swimming Club has organised a 100-yard race every Christmas morning. In 1913, the Peter Pan Cup was inaugurated for this race by J. M. Barrie, the creator of the fictional character Peter Pan.

There are many recreational facilities around the Serpentine, as well as boating on the lake itself. In 1860, the Serpentine was to be modified into a skating pond with formal edges. This scheme was not implemented. Among the landmarks near the lake is the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain.

== Geography of the lake ==
Originally the lake was fed by the River Westbourne entering at the Italian Garden at the north-western end of the Long Water. The Westbourne ceased to provide the water for the Serpentine in 1834, as it had become polluted so water was for some years pumped from the tidal Thames. The water is now supplied by three boreholes drilled into the Upper Chalk. The first borehole is at the Italian Gardens, the second at the Diana Memorial and the third, drilled in 2012 to a depth of , is within of there. The Long Water runs south-east from this point to Serpentine Bridge, where the lake curves to the east, following the natural contours of the land. At the eastern end, water flows out via a sluice in the dam, forming a small ornamental waterfall at the Dell where a small garden exists landscaped in the 1870s by Lord Redesdale. The outflow has not historically maintained the waterfall, and re-circulation pumps were installed in the Dell, below the dam, to sustain this feature. The restoration work in 2012 restored the flows into the Serpentine and this waterfall is now restored as originally designed. Historically the river flowed mainly exposed due south from this point as the mutual limits of Westminster and Kensington, but since 1850 is culverted (runs underground) to reach the Thames near Chelsea Bridge.

The lake has a maximum depth of ; it is often reported to be deeper, but bathymetric surveys by the Royal Park in 2010 revealed the design of the lake.

There are two lakeside restaurants and various recreational facilities on the lake shore.

== History ==
In 1730 Queen Caroline, wife of George II, ordered the damming of the River Westbourne in Hyde Park as part of a general redevelopment of Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Original monastic ponds may have existed in the location and these were modified as part of the 1730–1732 scheme to create a single lake. At that time, the Westbourne formed eleven natural ponds in the park. During the 1730s, the lake filled to its current size and shape. The redevelopment was carried out by Royal Gardener Charles Bridgeman, who dammed the Westbourne to create the artificial lake, and dug a large pond in the centre of Kensington Gardens (The Round Pond) to be a focal point for pathways in the park.

At the time of construction, artificial lakes were typically long and straight garden canals, as at St James&#x27;s Park, where the canal was excavated in the 1660s (later turned into a curving lake). The Serpentine was one of the earliest artificial lakes designed to appear natural, and was widely imitated in parks and gardens nationwide.

The lake achieved notoriety in December 1816 when Harriet Westbrook, the pregnant wife of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, was found drowned in the Serpentine having left a suicide note addressed to her father, sister and husband. Shelley married Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin less than two weeks later.

The lake formed a focal point of the 1814 celebrations which marked a century of Hanoverian rule and re-enacted the British victory at Trafalgar nine years previously, and of the 1851 Great Exhibition, with the Crystal Palace standing on its southern shore. Following the introduction of more stringent regulations to protect the environment in the park, the relocation of the Crystal Palace, and the construction of the nearby Albertopolis complex of museums and exhibitions, large-scale events ceased to take place on the banks of the Serpentine. However, it was the location for the 1977 Silver Jubilee celebrations, and a venue for the 2012 Olympics.

In the 1820s, the park was extensively redesigned by Decimus Burton. At the same time, John Rennie the Younger designed and oversaw the Serpentine Bridge as part of newly built West Carriage Drive bounding Hyde Park against Kensington Gardens, dividing the lake into the Serpentine (east) and the Long Water (west).

In 2011, the Royal Parks embarked on the restoration of the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water and the quality of the aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of the lake, which had a turnover time of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new borehole water being pumped into the lake. The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply the lake with up to of water per annum ensuring that the lake remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing of the lake is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed to the base of the lake. These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology of the lake was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of the lake. These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012. The resultant water quality of the lake was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012. 

== Recreation ==

=== Swimming ===
A rectangular swimming area on the southern bank was opened in 1930. Known as Lansbury&#x27;s Lido, it is partitioned off from the rest of the lake by a perimeter of buoys. There is a fee for entering the lido, and changing rooms are available. It is normally open only in the summer, typically between 10:00 and 17:30, although members of the Serpentine Swimming Club may swim all the year round from 05:00 to 09:30. The Peter Pan Christmas Day Race is only open to regular participants in the Saturday swimming competitions during the winter.

The Serpentine was used as the venue for the swimming portion of the triathlon and for the marathon swimming events at the 2012 Olympic Games.

Swim Serpentine was created as a two-day open water event in the summer. It is organised by London Marathon events.

=== Peter Pan Cup ===

Since 1864, the Serpentine has hosted a swimming competition every Christmas morning at 9 am. In 1904, author J. M. Barrie awarded the Peter Pan Cup to the winner of the race, a tradition which has continued ever since. Owing to the hazards of swimming in freezing water, the race is open only to members of the Serpentine Swimming Club.

=== Boating ===
Rowing boats are available for hire. In 2002 the Serpentine hosted the Mercedes Benz World Rowing Sprints, in which several international crews raced over .

=== Solarshuttle ===
In the summer months, (The) &quot;Solarshuttle&quot;, a solar-powered boat ferries passengers between the northern and southern banks of the Serpentine. At long and carrying 42 passengers, it is the largest wholly solar-powered passenger boat operating in the UK.

== Landmarks ==
The Hyde Park Holocaust Memorial, unveiled in 1983 stands at the eastern end of the Serpentine, immediately beyond the dam. A memorial on the northern shore of the lake was erected by Norwegian seamen in 1978 in thanks for the safe haven they were given in Britain after their country surrendered to the Germans in 1940, during the Second World War.

The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain, opened in 2004, sits on the southern shore near West Carriage Drive. At first beset with problems, needing a three-week closure, it has become one of the UK&#x27;s most popular attractions, with 800, 000 visitors a year. Sharing the bank is the Serpentine Gallery and the Serpentine Sackler Gallery opened in 2013 converting an 1805-built gunpowder store, across a bridge.

On the northern side of the lake, opposite The Lido, are two self-contained boat houses. The East Boat House, 1903, erected by the Royal Humane Society and West Boat House, 1952, for the new chlorination launch, to replace a former boat house bombed in 1940. Nearby is a grass amphitheatre known as the Cockpit. This disused gravel pit was the scene of The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Stones in the Park&quot; concert in 1969. Concerts here, from 1968, were initially organised by Blackhill Enterprises. This area can also be seen in the 1953 film &quot;Genevieve&quot;, as the starting point for the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run.

<text>The Embraer ERJ family (for Embraer Regional Jet) are regional jets designed and produced by the Brazilian aerospace company Embraer. The family includes the ERJ 135 (37 passengers), ERJ 140 (44 passengers), and ERJ 145 (50 passengers), as well as the Legacy 600 business jet and the R-99 family of military aircraft.

Development of the ERJ 145 was launched in 1989. Its early design took the form of a turbofan-powered stretch of the existing turboprop-powered EMB 120 Brasilia regional aircraft. After the project was temporarily suspended in 1990, work on a revised configuration was undertaken during the early 1990s. While retaining the three-abreast seating of the Brasilia, the twinjet featured a new swept wing and is powered by two rear-fuselage-mounted Rolls-Royce AE 3007 turbofans for a range up to . By the time of its maiden flight on 11 August 1995, Embraer had garnered 18 firm orders, 16 options and 127 letters of intent for the type. On 10 December 1996, the ERJ 145 received its type certificate; it entered revenue service with ExpressJet Airlines on 6 April 1997.

Embraer prioritised the rapid expansion of the family, leading to the introduction of the shortened ERJ 135 and ERJ 140 in 1999. The ERJ series&#x27; primary competition came from the similarly sized Bombardier CRJ100/200 regional jets. In December 2002, Embraer entered a partnership with the Chinese aerospace manufacturer Harbin Aircraft Industry Group to jointly produce the ERJ 145 in Harbin, China; this production line was shuttered in 2016 after producing 41 aircraft. Overall production of the type was terminated in 2020, by which point 1,231 aircraft were built. By this point, the ERJ family had been eclipsed by the newer and more advanced E-Jet family.

== Development ==
=== Background and early design ===
The ERJ 145 was designed for a perceived new market for regional jet aircraft, where the increased speed, comfort and passenger appeal would outweigh the inherent fuel economy of the turboprop aircraft which were in service and in development.

The 45–48 seat EMB 145, nicknamed Amazon, was launched at the Paris Air Show in 1989 as an stretch of the EMB 120 Brasilia developed for US$150 million plus $50 million for training and marketing, one third the cost of the cancelled Short Brothers FJX project. Its $11 million unit cost would have been $3 million less than the Canadair CRJ. The jet was anticipated to be able to travel at , equipped with the CFE738, Lycoming ALF 502 or Rolls-Royce/Allison AB580 turbofan engines, with the model to be selected in the summer of 1989. It was targeted for a late 1992 introduction with six produced, then ramping to 60 per year by 1995. It aimed for half of a market for 1,000 aircraft with break-even after twelve years with 400 sold.

Keeping 75% of the Brasilia parts and systems, the EMB 145 Amazon aimed for a 1991 first flight. The stretch resulted from two plugs of the diameter fuselage in the front and behind the redesigned wing. Its supercritical airfoil with a 14% root thickness had its chord extended at the leading edge with a slight sweepback, increased aspect ratio and winglets. The overwing podded engines were expected to generate of thrust. Designed for stages, up to with a reduced payload, it had a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) and a operating empty weight.

=== Engine selection ===
In early 1990, no engine supplier willing to share the risk of the $250 million development was yet selected. The Allison GMA3007 (later renamed the Rolls-Royce AE 3007) was selected in March 1990, with a maximum 40 kN (7,100 lbf) take-off thrust and growth capability to , first flight was then due in September 1991. Rolls-Royce could participate in the fan and low-pressure turbine, its original responsibility on the RB.580 joint development. By May, it had 296 commitments from 19 operators, and was seeking external finance. In June, maiden flight was expected by the end of 1990 before mid-1993 deliveries for $11.5 million each, cabin pressurisation was increased to from the Brasilia .

Following the engine selection, design was revised: length decreased from , span increased from , aspect ratio to 9.3 from 9.2.
MTOW rose from , basic operating weight from , maximum fuel from and payload from ; wing loading increased from , time-to-climb to FL400 gained 5 min to 30 min and maximum cruise rose from 405 kn (750 km/h) to 428 kn (787 km/h) at FL360. The first delivery in 1993 was slated to Comair, which ordered 60.
In November 1990, a major reduction in Brazilian government spending, which held 61% of its voting share, resulted in Embraer laying off 32% of its 12,800 employees and suspending development of the EMB 145 for six months.

=== Revised design ===
In March 1991, a revised configuration started wind tunnel testing: the quarter chord wing sweep increased to 22.3° with underslung engines for lower aerodynamic drag. This reduced the span by almost , reducing its aspect ratio from 9.3 to 8.4 and wing area from . The semi-monocoque wing has two main and one auxiliary spar and holds 4,500 kg (9,900 lb) of fuel, it has double-slotted fowler flaps and spoilers. To accommodate the underwing engines, the landing gear is longer, allowing using jetways, and the fuselage was lengthened from .

During June 1991, the Brazilian Government loaned $600 million to Embraer and in July the programme was re-evaluated while tooling was 80% complete. By November 1991, Embraer was still looking for partners to share the risk of the $350 million project, hoping to obtain Government approval by the end of the year. Sold at $12 million with an all-digital cockpit and engines, it had letters of intent for 337 units. The scheduled date for the first flight slipped to 1992 and certification for late 1993.

=== Definitive design ===

After re-evaluation late in 1991, the layout was again revised with two rear-fuselage-mounted engines, and a Mach 0.8 cruise speed would be tested in the wind tunnel. Seat pitch is . A further stretch to 50–55 passengers is limited by a 12° rotation angle. Embraer continued to look for partners to share the $350 million development as first flight was expected for late 1994. In December 1994, Embraer was privatised for 80% to Brazilian and US investors while 20% was kept by the Brazilian Government.

The definitive ERJ 145 first flew on August 11, 1995, with 18 firm orders, 16 options and 127 letters of intent. A 1,300h flight-test programme for the prototype and three pre-series aircraft (excluding two ground-test airframes) was planned within 13 months for certification in the third quarter of 1996, before deliveries in the fourth quarter of 1996 to launch customer Flight West. The $14.5 million aircraft is developed with risk-sharing partners including Spain&#x27;s Gamesa producing the wing; Chile&#x27;s Enaer for the tail; and the USA&#x27;s C&amp;D Interiors equipping the cabin. The standard maximum ramp weight is for the extended-range, it is fitted with Honeywell Primus 1000 integrated avionics.

The estimated $300 million development cost is divided between Embraer for 34%, risksharing partners for 33% (including Belgium&#x27;s SONACA supplying centre and rear fuselage sections, doors, engine pylons and wing leading-edges), long-term loans from Brazilian development-funding institutions for 23% and participating suppliers for 10%.
On both 370 km (200 nm) hubfeeder and 1,100 km hub-bypass sectors, the EMB145 was expected to offer lower operating costs than the similarly priced Saab 2000 high-speed turboprop and the CRJ. Its $15 million price was $4 million lower than the CRJ.

The Flight Test campaign took four aircraft: S/N 801, PT-ZJA, S/N 001, PT-ZJB, S/N 002, PT-ZJC and S/N 003, PT-ZJD. Only S/N 003 was fitted with passenger seats and had no FTI (flight test instrumentation) and was used for functional and reliability tests.

In July 1996, its certification was targeted for October, and the unit cost was then forecast to be US$15 million. The first delivery was planned for late November, while 29 aircraft were to be produced in 1997, 38 in 1998 and at least 48 per year thereafter. Its MTOW could be raised from the standard for an Enhanced Range version. Flight tests allowed to increase its cruise speed to Mach 0.78 from 0.74, and showed fuel economy was 7% better than predicted. Before the Summer 1996 Farnborough Airshow, Embraer held 62 firm orders and 218 options. Continental Express then purchased 25 EMB145s and took 175 options. More than 50 seats would need a wider fuselage for four-abreast seating, an enlarged wing and a more powerful turbofan.

On 10 December 1996, type certification was issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), clearing the type for operational use in North America.

Embraer delivered 892 units of all variants through 2006, and predicted that another 102 units would be delivered in the 2007–2016 time period.

=== Production in China ===
During December 2002, Embraer entered a partnership with the Chinese aerospace manufacturer Harbin Aircraft Industry Group, resulting in the creation of &quot;Harbin Embraer Aircraft Industry&quot;, a joint venture company, to locally produce the ERJ 145 in Harbin for the Chinese market. The assembly line was sized to produce a maximum of 24 aircraft per year, assembling complete knock down kits prepared by Embraer at its facilities overseas. During February 2004, the first delivery of a Chinese-assembled ERJ 145 took place; two months later, China Southern took delivery for two of the locally-built ERJ145s.

In April 2009, it was announced that Hainan Airlines had halved its original order for 50 ERJ145s from the joint venture. By April 2011, 41 aircraft had reportedly been produced in China, considerably less than the line&#x27;s capacity. By this time, the company was undertaking changes to facilitate the local production of the similar Embraer Legacy 650 business jet as well. In March 2016, the final delivery of aircraft produced by the joint venture took place. Two months later, the discontinuation of the local assembly initiative was announced; it was reported that in excess of 40 ERJ 145 and five Legacy 650s has been completed by this point.

=== Shortened versions ===
Embraer has introduced two shortened versions of the ERJ145. All three aircraft share the same crew type rating, allowing pilots to fly any of the three aircraft without the need for further training.

The ERJ 140 is shorter, seating 44 passengers, and has 96% parts commonality with the ERJ145. The only significant changes are a shorter fuselage, a slightly derated engine and an increased range. The ERJ140 was designed with fewer seats in order to meet the needs of some major United States airlines, which have an agreement with the pilots&#x27; union to limit the number of 50-seat aircraft that can be flown by their affiliates. At launch, Embraer estimated the cost of an ERJ140 to be approximately US $15.2 million. The estimated cost of development of the ERJ140 was US $45 million.

The ERJ 135 is shorter, seating 37 passengers, and has 95% parts commonality with the ERJ145. The first ERJ 135 entered service in 1999.

== Design ==
The Embraer ERJ family is a series of twin-engine jet-powered regional jets. The ERJ family retains a relatively high level of commonality with the Embraer Legacy 600 business jet; the principal difference being the addition of winglets and additional fuel tanks as standard on the latter. The airframe is composed of stretched, machined and chemically milled aluminium, with CFRP for moving parts, GFRP for fairings and sidewalls, kevlar for leading edges and Nomex honeycomb-CFRP/GFRP sandwiches for floors.

The EMB145 family is generally powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce AE 3007 series turbofan engines. Each engine has a bypass ratio of 5:1 and can generate up to 8,917 lbf of thrust. The engines are controlled by a dual Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC) arrangement, which is capable of controlling virtually all aspects of the engine and sending engine data to be displayed on the engine-indicating and crew-alerting system (EICAS) for the flight crew.

The ERJ 145 family initially shared its cockpit layout with that of the aborted CBA123. It is equipped with the Honeywell Primus 1000 avionics suite. This provides an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) that comprises five monitors; from left to right, these consists of a Primary Flight Display (PFD), Multi-Function Display (MFD), Engine Indication and Crew Alerting System (EICAS), Multi-Function Display (MFD) (Co-pilot) and Primary Flight Display (PFD) (Co-pilot). While these are CRT displays as standard, they can be upgraded to LCD counterparts, which are lighter and have additional functionality.

In a typical commuter/airliner configuration, the ERJ 145 can accommodate up to 60 seats, although many operators would have fewer seats than this on their selected configuration. Embraer has offered a premium cabin configuration, which seats between 16 and 28 passengers in a more comfortable and spacious arrangement. The cabin can accommodate various interiors, these being customisable to fulfil each customer&#x27;s own requirements. The fittings can be suited to various market sectors, from the relatively modest commuter to the more luxury-inclined VIP traveller. It is typical, but not compulsory, for ERJ 135/145 airliners to be configured with an offset aisle. Dependent on an individual aircraft&#x27;s role, overhead bins may be installed; their exclusion gives more headroom but reduces the available storage space for carry-on luggage.

Embraer has stated that every ERJ 145 is capable of being converted into a semi-private aircraft configuration, and that the conversion process can be performed at Embraer-owned service centers. Numerous aftermarket companies have also offered their own conversions of ERJ family aircraft, often involving various levels of interior refurbishment, such as the installation of an expanded galley, redesigned lavatories, seat track relocation, at-seat power provision, Wi-Fi, alternative ceilings, LED lighting upgrades, and various storage options.

== Operational history ==
In December 1996, the first delivery of the ERJ 145 was made to ExpressJet Airlines (then the regional division of Continental Airlines flying as Continental Express). As a newly-established company, ExpressJet chose the ERJ 145 with which to launch its operations; this was achieved in April 1997, the same month that Embraer completed deliveries to the operator. Particular value was attached the American market as there was a near-insatiable hunger for regional aircraft at this time, and thus a substantial amount of potential sales to capitalise upon.

The ERJ 145 quickly entered service with various other operators throughout the Americas, being particularly popular on high-demand regional routes. However, the type proved to be less successful in the European market allegedly on account of logistical difficulties. Nonetheless, several European operators did emerge; LOT Polish Airlines operated as many as 14 ERJ145s, while British Regional Airlines also flew the type on behalf of the national flag carrier British Airways.

During the early 2000s, various governments opted to procure the ERJ 145 as dedicated transports for high-ranking officials, amongst some other purposes. One such country was Belgium, who operated a pair of ERJ145s for VIP transport, regularly carrying the Belgian prime minister, cabinet members, members of the royal family, or military officials, between 2001 and 2020.

By the 2020s, various operators had elected to retire their ERJ 145 fleets in favour of newer airliners; they have often been replaced by members of Embraer&#x27;s E-Jet family. Aircraft formerly used as regional airliners have often been sold on to charter operators. To capitalise on the growing sector of corporate/private travellers, some customers have elected to acquire secondhand ERJ145s from regional operators and refurbishing them with new interiors with more luxurious fittings to suit their new role. As of August 2021, the largest operator of the ERJ 145 is CommuteAir, which serves as &quot;United Express&quot; under United Airlines, possessing a fleet of 165 aircraft.

During September 1999, the slightly smaller ERJ140 was introduced; it performing its first flight on 27 June 2000, and entering commercial service in July 2001. Envoy Air, the regional jet subsidiary of American Airlines flying as American Eagle, operated the majority of the ERJ140s built, including the first to be delivered (&quot;N800AE&quot;) However, Envoy Air opted to withdraw all of their ERJ140 fleet in mid-2020. By early 2005, 74 ERJ140s had been delivered; while this model has been marketed as &quot;ERJ140&quot;, its designation on the company&#x27;s internal documents and on FAA certification is &quot;EMB 135KL&quot;. In March 2007, ExpressJet entered into a short-term agreement to operate some regional routes for JetBlue Airways using its ERJ 145 aircraft.

In May 2017, the ERJ 135 was leased $33,000 to $43,000 per month ($396,000 to $516,000 per year) and the ERJ 145 $38,000 to $55,000 per month ($456,000 to $660,000 per year).

As of 18 March 2018, the Embraer ERJ family was involved in 24 incidents, incurring a total of eight hull losses without any fatalities.

Launch customer: ExpressJet Airlines. 
* Legacy 600 (EMB 135BJ) – Business jet variant based on the ERJ 135.
* Legacy 650 (EMB 135BJ) – Business jet variant based on the Legacy 600 with increased range.
* Harbin Embraer ERJ 145 – joint venture with Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation

The physical engines are the same (Rolls-Royce AE 3007), however, the FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine/Electronic Control) logic is what differs between the various models in regards to total thrust capability.

The extended range version, the ERJ 145ER, has Rolls-Royce AE 3007A engines rated at 31.3 kN (7,036 lb) thrust, with the option of more powerful AE 3007A1 engines. A, A1, A1P models are mechanically identical but differ in thrust due to variations in FADEC software. The A1E engine, however, has not only new software, but significantly upgraded mechanical components.

The long-range ERJ 145LR aircraft is equipped with Rolls-Royce AE 3007A1 engines which provide 15% more power. The engines are flat rated at 33.1 kN (7,440 lb) thrust to provide improved climb characteristics and improved cruise performance in high ambient temperatures.

The extra-long-range ERJ 145XR aircraft is equipped with Rolls-Royce AE 3007A1E engines. The high performance engines provide lower specific fuel consumption (SFC) and improved performance in hot and high conditions. The engines also yield a higher altitude for one-engine-inoperable conditions.&quot; CommuteAir is the only operator of the ERJ 145XR. February 2011 Embraer presented its new EMB-145 AEW&amp;C for India.

Despite the multiple variants, pilots need only one type rating to fly any variant of the ERJ aircraft. Companies like American Eagle utilizes this benefit with its mixed fleet of ERJ 135ER/LR and ERJ145EP/LR/XR. Shared type-ratings allow operators to utilize a single pilot pool for any ERJ aircraft.

<doc id="273891" wikidata="Q213044" url="?curid=273891" title="Bay cat">
<text>The bay cat (Catopuma badia), also known as the Bornean bay cat, is a small wild cat endemic to the island of Borneo that appears to be relatively rare compared to sympatric wild cats, based on the paucity of historical, as well as recent records. Since 2002, it has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List because it is estimated that fewer than 2,500 mature individuals exist, and that the population declined in the past. The bay cat has been recorded as rare and seems to occur at relatively low density, even in pristine habitats.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
&quot;Felis badia&quot; was the scientific name proposed by John Edward Gray in 1874, who first described a bay cat skin and skull collected by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1856 in Sarawak. This cat was first thought to be a kitten of an Asian golden cat.
In 1932, Reginald Innes Pocock placed the species in the monotypic genus &quot;Badiofelis&quot;. In 1978, it was placed in the genus &quot;Catopuma&quot;.

Tissue and blood samples were acquired only in late 1992 from the female brought to the Sarawak Museum. Morphological and genetic analysis confirmed the close relationship with the Asian golden cat, and that the two species had been separated from a common ancestor for 4.9 to 5.3 million years, long before the geological separation of Borneo from mainland Asia.

The bay cat&#x27;s classification as &quot;Catopuma&quot; was widely recognized until 2006. Because of the evident close relationship of the bay cat and the Asian golden cat with the marbled cat, all three species were suggested in 2006 to be grouped in the genus &quot;Pardofelis&quot;.

==Characteristics==

The bay cat&#x27;s fur is of a bright chestnut colour, but paler beneath, the limbs and the tail being rather paler and more reddish. The ears are rounded, covered with a short blackish-brown fur at the outer side, paler brown within and with a narrow brown margin. The tail is elongated and tapering at the end, with a white central streak occupying the rear half of the lower side, gradually becoming wider and of a purer white towards the tip, which has a small black spot at its upper end.

Its short, rounded head is dark greyish-brown with two dark stripes originating from the corner of each eye, and the back of the head has a dark M-shaped marking. The backs of the ears are dark greyish without any white spot. The underside of the chin is white, and two faint brown stripes are on the cheeks.
In the years between 1874 and 2004, only 12 specimens were measured. Their head-to-body length varied from with long tails. They were estimated to have an adult weight of , but too few living specimens have been obtained to allow a more reliable estimate.

== Distribution and habitat ==
In the 19th century, only seven bay cat skins surfaced, and the first live female caught in 1992 on the Sarawak–Indonesian border was brought to the Sarawak Museum on the verge of death.
In the mid-1990s, the most reliable sightings have been reported in Gunung Palung National Park and the upper Kapuas River in West Kalimantan. Two concentrations were reported in the island&#x27;s interior at the time, in habitat types varying from swamp forests, lowland dipterocarp forest to hill forests up to at least . One unconfirmed sighting occurred at on Mount Kinabalu.
It inhabits dense tropical forests, and has been observed in rocky limestone outcrops and in logged forest, and close to the coast. At least three specimens were found near rivers, but this was probably due to collector convenience rather than evidence of habitat preference. In 2002, a bay cat was photographed in Sarawak&#x27;s Gunung Mulu National Park.
From 2003 to 2005, 15 single bay cats were observed in Sarawak, Sabah and Kalimantan, but none in Brunei. Almost all the historical and recent records are from close proximity to water bodies such as rivers and mangroves, suggesting the bay cat may be closely associated with such habitats.

In central Sarawak, only one individual was recorded in more than a year of camera trapping between August 2010 and November 2011 in an area that was regenerating from logging.
Most records of the bay cat obtained in Sarawak between 2003 and 2018 were located in lowland riverine and montane forests below ; its occurrence increased at a distance of away from roads.

In Sabah, a camera trapping survey from July 2008 to January 2009 in the northwestern part of Deramakot Forest Reserve yielded one photo of a male bay cat in an area of about in a total survey effort of 1916 camera trap nights. This record expanded the known range of the bay cat to the north.
Between May and December 2011, it was also recorded in the Kalabakan Forest Reserve, a highly-disturbed commercial forest reserve that had been logged between 1978 and the early 2000s; natural forest remains in an area of , and large terrain is covered by an oil palm plantation and access roads. The bay cat was photographed off-trail in seven of eight records, indicating that it tends to avoid logged areas.
A repeated survey in Kalabakan Forest Reserve in 2018 yielded records in just eight of 74 locations during more than 7,200 camera trap days.
One individual was recorded in Danum Valley Conservation Area.
Data from 578 camera trapping stations in eight forest reserves and two plantation sites in Sabah revealed that the bay cat inhabits core forest areas with no to little disturbance at elevations of , but does not live in plantations.

In Kalimantan, it was recorded in at elevations from in Kutai National Park, Wehea Protection Forest and Sungai Wain Protection Forest during surveys in 2012 and 2013.
In Central Kalimantan, a single bay cat was recorded in a mosaic of heath and peat swamp forest in the Rungan River catchment area during surveys between 2016 and 2018.

== Behavior and ecology ==
Bay cats recorded in Sabah exhibited a diurnal activity pattern with a peak in the morning and another peak in the early afternoon.
Bay cats recorded in nine study areas in both protected and non-protected areas in Sarawak were also diurnal.

In Sarawak, a bay cat was allegedly observed on a branch from the ground close to the river during a night hunting expedition.
Nothing is known about its diet and reproductive behavior.

== Threats ==

The bay cat is forest-dependent and increasingly threatened by habitat destruction following deforestation in Borneo. Habitat loss due to commercial logging and conversion to oil palm plantations pose the greatest threat to the bay cat. Oil palm plantations are likely to expand in the future as a result of the push for biofuels. Borneo has one of the world&#x27;s highest deforestation rates. While in the mid-1980s, forests still covered nearly three-quarters of the island, by 2005 only 52% of Borneo was still forested. Both forests and land make way for human settlement.
Less than 6% of Indonesia&#x27;s and Malaysia&#x27;s land region is protected.

Poaching for the illegal wildlife trade also poses a significant threat. Bay cats have been captured in the wild for the trade as pets and skins.

==Conservation==
The bay cat is listed on CITES Appendix II. It is fully protected by national legislation across most of its range. Hunting and trade are prohibited in Kalimantan, Sabah, and Sarawak. The bay cat remains one of the least studied of the world&#x27;s wild cats, hampering the development of conservation actions.

<doc id="273903" wikidata="Q37904" url="?curid=273903" title="Aidi">
<text>The Aidi is a dog breed native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa and is used as a livestock guardian, protecting herds of sheep and goats. It is most commonly found in Morocco, which holds the standard under the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. The Aidi is also found in Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. It possesses hunting capabilities and good scenting ability. In Morocco, it is often paired in hunting with the Sloughi, which chases down prey that the Aidi has located by scent. 
== History ==

The Aidi is a breed native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. Despite being initially referred to as the Atlas Sheepdog in the 1963 standard, the Aidi has never been used as a sheepdog, and this misnomer was corrected in 1969. Known for its courage, the Aidi has traditionally lived and worked in the Atlas Mountains, providing protection to its owner and property against wildcats, predators, and strangers.

The breed has also been referred to as the Berber, named after the Berber tribes who utilized the dog. The Aidi shares some ancestral resemblance with the pariah dog. In the past, it played a vital role as a protector for desert nomad tribes, with the most alert and aggressive dogs stationed around the camp perimeter at night. Historically, the Aidi has not received the same level of admiration from the tribes as breeds like the Sloughi, which are considered noble. However, a club has recently been formed in Morocco to preserve the breed&#x27;s purity due to its significant contributions as a protector, hunter, police dog, and companion.

While the Aidi has primarily been used as a working dog, it has also gained popularity as a household pet in urban areas. When given sufficient tasks and exercise, the Aidi can adapt well to an urban environment and make a content and fulfilled companion.

In terms of color and flock-guarding abilities, the Aidi shares many characteristics with other livestock guardian dog breeds.

==Appearance==
Standing in height and weighing around , the Aidi&#x27;s lean, muscular body is protected by a coarse, thick, weather-resistant coat with a heavy plumed tail. The coat is heavy and soft. The head is bear-like and in proportion to the rest of the body. The breed has a tapered muzzle with a black or brown nose that usually matches the coat. Their jaws are strong with tight black or brown lips. The medium-sized ears are tipped forward and drop slightly. The eyes are medium, with a dark color and dark rims. Coat colours are white, black, black and white, pale red, and tawny. In some regions of Morocco, the ears are cropped and the tail is docked.

<doc id="273906" wikidata="Q1756401" url="?curid=273906" title="Pacific Rim National Park Reserve">
<text>Pacific Rim National Park Reserve is a national park located in British Columbia, Canada, which comprises three separate regions: Long Beach, the Broken Group Islands, and the West Coast Trail. It is located in the Pacific Coast Mountains, which are characterized by rugged coasts and temperate rainforests.

Widespread vegetation found in the park includes western hemlock, Sitka spruce, western red-cedar, deer fern and sword fern. Animal species vary from marine and intertidal species, such as humpback whales and ochre sea star, to terrestrial mammals, such as Vancouver Coastal Sea wolves. For recreational purposes, Long Beach is used for surfing and windsurfing, the Broken Group for sea kayaking, and the West Coast Trail for hiking, as well as camping in all areas and scuba diving in the winter months in the Long Beach and Broken Group areas.

The Wickaninnish Beach Provincial Park formed the nucleus upon which the national park was assembled. After years of negotiation between the federal government and the provincial government of W.A.C. Bennett, a breakthrough was reached after Jean Chrétien took over for Arthur Laing as the federal minister responsible for parks. British Columbia adopted the &quot;West Coast National Park Act&quot; in 1969, and the two governments signed an agreement in 1970 to create the park through land assembly and extinguishing forestry rights. Following protracted negotiations, the park was finally added to the &quot;National Parks Act&quot; in 2000, classified as a &quot;park reserve&quot; based on an accepted claim of certain rights to the area by the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council.

==History==
The early popularity of national parks, like Banff and Yoho, created speculation about other potential parks, like one on Vancouver Island with access to the Pacific Ocean. The recreational potential of Long Beach was known and the nonprofit Canadian National Parks Association put forward the idea, in 1929, of it becoming a park. In 1930, at the request of the federal government, the provincial government placed a reserve on land in the Nitinat Lake area, and in 1948, the provincial government reserved land that would later become the Wickaninnish Beach Provincial Park.

Reconnaissance trips by government representatives, one of them being Hugh Llewellyn Keenleyside, found insufficient rationale for establishing a park there at that time, due to its remote and inaccessible location, outstanding forestry encumbrances, and with respect to its development as a health resort–type park, its cold waters, and fog, among other reasons. Regardless, in 1947 the Victoria Chamber of Commerce added their voice to advocating park here, in the form of an addition to the Strathcona Provincial Park with land along the Clayoquot Arm to Long Beach.

In 1959, the provincial government opened both the Wickaninnish Beach Provincial Park (which was expanded in 1961 and 1968) and Highway 4, from Tofino to Port Alberni. The highway resulted in thousands of new visitors descending on the beaches each year throughout the 1960s, including for international surfing competitions from 1966 to 1968. Though new tourist accommodations did open, some along the beach, the number of visitors far exceeded Tofino and Ucluelet&#x27;s capacity, resulting in many camping on the beach. This led to a plundering of the foreshore for food and souvenirs, building temporary shacks from driftwood, improvised latrines, and left-behind garbage and vehicles sunk in the sand.

The deteriorating conditions of the beach and the inability of the local community and the province to cope fueled a more urgent call for a national park, particularly by the Vancouver Island Chambers of Commerce and local MLA Howard McDiarmid. However, communication and negotiations with federal Minister of Resources Arthur Laing with the provincial Minister of Recreation and Conservation Ken Kiernan and the cabinet of W.A.C. Bennett were strained, as they disagreed on the appropriate size of the park and cost-sharing, in addition to their political animosity. The project would only advance after 1968 when Jean Chrétien replaced Laing, as Pierre Trudeau succeeded Lester B. Pearson as prime-minister.

The BC government was hesitant to relinquish rights to the Effingham Islands portion of the Broken Group and to lose forestry activities in the West Coast Trail area, but proceeded to adopt the &quot;West Coast National Park Act&quot; in early 1969 which authorized the Minister of Recreation and Conservation to enter into an agreement with the federal government to establish the national park along the west coast of Vancouver Island. The final agreement was shortly reached and endorsed by the province in Order-in-Council 1466/1970 with the province responsible for acquiring lands and the federal government paying for half the costs. Following the agreement, lands were assembled by the province within the areas delineated by the agreement and transferred them the federal government with both paying the acquisition costs equally. The Wickaninnish Beach Provincial Park was transferred to federal government in 1971 to form the core of the Long Beach Unit and the province purchased or expropriated the private lands around the beach, along with the crown lands of the Broken Group Islands.

The park&#x27;s opening ceremony occurred in 1971 and was attended by Princess Anne of England who was presented with a driftwood abstract sculpture by Jean Chrétien, the minister responsible for Parks Canada. The sculpture was the work of local artist Godfrey Stephens. However, the acquisition deadline of 1975 was missed as the two governments and the companies with the timber rights on the provincial crown land, B.C. Forest Products Limited and MacMillan Bloedel, could not reach a compensation settlement. By 1982, the Broken Group Unit and most of the Long Beach Unit had been secured but all of the West Coast Trail Unit was tied up in the disagreement on the value of the timber; an appraisal by the provincial forestry ministry of the value of the timber rights that would secure the remaining lands was deemed unacceptably high by the federal counterparts. An agreement was finally reached in 1988 to transfer the remaining lands, free of encumbrances, and the park was formally included into the &quot;National Parks Act&quot; in 2000 with Bill C-27 of the second session of the 36th Canadian Parliament.

===Aboriginal presence===
The &quot;Canada National Parks Act&quot; classifies national parks where the geographic area is subject to a claim in respect of aboriginal rights that has been accepted for negotiation by the Government of Canada as a &quot;park reserve&quot; which allows for the continuing of traditional renewable resource harvesting activities by aboriginal persons. Related to the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council had submitted a claim in 1980 which the government accepted for negotiation in June 1983. In the early park formation little consultation had occurred with the First Nations whose interests in the land they intended to purchase or trade for other similar lands. While seven First Nations claim area within the park as part of their traditional territory, Parks Canada incorporated a working relationship with those interested in its management. Beginning in 1995 the First Nations Program resulted in the creation of the Nuu-chah-nulth interpretative trail, cultural information included in educational literature and displays, increased employment in park services, and shared management responsibilities.

The park boundaries exclude 21 Indian reserves belonging to seven different First Nations, though most of the park is claimed as part of their traditional territories which were never ceded, including the Huu-ay-aht, Ditidaht, Pacheedaht, and the Hupacasath. In the Long Beach area where the Tla-o-qui-aht claim traditional territory, they have declared the entire Kennedy Lake watershed, as well as Meares Island, as a tribal park. In the Broken Group area, an archaeological site on Benson Island found evidence of human presence dating back more than 5000 years, though the Tseshaht are the only remaining group whose people had lived on the islands. While Benson Island had hosted a summer village (and wintered in the area now known as Port Alberni), it had been abandoned; a subsequent village on Effingham burnt down in 1914.

==Geography==
In the Parks Canada system of natural region representation, the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, along with the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve, represents Pacific Coast Mountains. Geographically, this natural region includes Vancouver Island, Haida Gwaii and the Coast Mountains. Based on its landscape and habitat diversity, Parks Canada characterizes this region as Canada&#x27;s rocky west coast created by crustal material moving eastward creating coastal mountains, deep fiords and channels carved by the release of water from retreating glaciers, and experiencing heavy rainfall and mild temperatures resulting in temperate rain forests.

===Long Beach===
The Long Beach Unit, located along Highway 4 between Tofino to Ucluelet, features several beaches, short trails, and a campground. Wickaninnish Bay is bordered by the eponymous Long Beach, as well as Combers Beach, and Wickaninnish Beach, while Florencia Bay to the south includes a more sheltered beach. The two bays are connected by a Nuu-chah-nulth Trail and the KWisitis Visitor Centre (formerly Wickaninnish Interpretive Centre). The Pacific Rim Visitor Centre, located at the park entrance along Highway 4, is the park&#x27;s primary information centre and meeting area. A separate park administrative and maintenance building is located further down the highway, closer to the campground and airport. The Tofino-Long Beach Airport, owned and operated by the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District, is an enclave within the park.

On the north side of the Long Beach Unit is Grice Bay. Its boat launch can be used for paddling around the bay or to access the Clayoquot Sound or the Browning Passage around the Esowista Peninsula to the ocean. The exclave portion at Kennedy Lake is a day use area for picnics and swimming but the area is flanked on both sides by the Kennedy Lake Provincial Park which has a campground and boat launch.

===Broken Group Islands===
The Broken Group Islands unit is a area in the Barkley Sound with over one hundred small islands. The area is predominantly marine with high-relief rock reefs and kelp beds anchored by a rocky substrate. The island beaches vary from shallow sand terrain to exposed weathered rock. The south side of the outer islands, such as Wouwer, Howell, Cree and Benson Islands, are subject to strong winds and swells, as are the Crossing Imperial Eagle and Loudon Channels between the group and Vancouver Island. The islands are uninhabited though archaeological sites show there are several abandoned village sites.

For recreational purposes, the area is predominantly used for sea kayaking, as well as related camping and wildlife viewing. Other marine vessels pass through the area but Parks Canada prohibits motorboats from landing on islands with campsites. Kayaks are most often launched from Toquart Bay to the north, but sometimes from Ucluelet which is 13 km from the first campsite at Clarke Island or from Bamfield which is 15 km from Gibraltar Island. Other boats can dock at Port Alberni. For multi-day trips, Parks Canada maintains campgrounds on seven of the islands: Hand, Turret, Gibraltar, Willis, Dodd, Clarke and Gilbert islands. The names of the islands are derived from an 1861 survey map of the area by George Henry Richards. There was formerly a campground on Benson Island but ended in 2009 at the request of the Tseshaht First Nation, though day-trips area are still permitted.

===West Coast Trail===

The West Coast Trail Unit covers and features the hiking trail between Port Renfrew and Bamfield. The corridor was created in 1889 as an extension of a telegraph line from Victoria to lighthouses along the coast, and eventually to Bamfield, the Canadian terminus of the All Red Line. After the disaster of the American steamship &quot;SS Valencia&quot;, in 1906 with 37 survivors reaching shore along the telegraph line, the federal government upgraded the corridor to act as a trail with several shelters along the way. By 1911, it was classified as a public highway with a 20 m (66 ft) right-of-way known as the Life Saving Trail or the Shipwrecked Mariners Trail. The federal government ended its maintenance program for the trail between Port Renfrew and Carmanah Point in 1954, and the remainder of the trail by 1967. Meanwhile, there were several failed attempts at development, including coal mining, fish canning, resort development in Clo-oose, and small-scale logging—the result of which are several abandoned donkey engines along the trail used to transfer logs down to the foreshore. Eventually the provincial government sold the timber rights but following advocacy by Sierra Club Canada and locals, the BC Parks branch placed a reserve, in 1964, around the trail which outdoor enthusiasts had continued using. With a national park being proposed at Long Beach, to which the federal government felt was too small by itself to be a national park, they were amenable to adding this trail. Sympathetic with the logging interests, the provincial government resisted but it was included in the 1970 agreement with its specific boundaries to be determined. Over the next several years, the provincial government, forestry companies, and park advocates negotiated and finalized the boundaries, with conservationists advocating for boundaries to include the entire watersheds and federal government advocating for a visual buffer between the trail and logging areas. While the Nitinat Triangle, northwest of Nitinat Lake, was added in 1973, the final boundaries were not agreed upon until 1988. In the meantime, there was a lack of trail maintenance since BC Parks viewed it as a national park though the land had yet to be transferred to the federal government, though Parks Canada did invest in repairs and improvements in 1973 and the early 1980s, including bridges and cable cars over creeks and various campsite facilities. The southern trailhead is located across Gordon River from Port Renfrew with first two campsites 5 and 13 km in. The northern trailhead is located across the Pachena River from Bamfield. From there, the Pachena Point Light is in and the first two campsites are at the 12 km and 14 km markers along the trail. The northern end of the trail, outside of Bamfield, also features a separate trail to Cape Beale with a campsite at Keeha Beach. Overall, the trail is typically done in 6 or 7 days with stretches along rocky beaches, rainforest, and rough, muddy terrain.
The Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, along with the Gwaii Haanas and Gulf Islands National Park Reserve, are the three national parks with direct access to the Pacific Ocean. Located on the west side of the Vancouver Island, the park is situated on the Estevan Lowlands, a thin strip of coastal land located between the ocean and the West Vancouver Island Fiordlands and Vancouver Island Ranges of the Insular Mountains. While the almost all of Vancouver Island is part of the Wrangellia Terrane, most of the Long Beach Unit is part of the Pacific Rim Terrane, separated from Wrangellia Terrane by the West Coast Fault.

==Climate==
Like the climates of nearby Tofino and Ucluelet, the park&#x27;s climate is the result of its unobstructed southwestern exposure to the ocean and its inland mountains to the northeast. The prevailing jet stream brings low pressure systems off the ocean from the Gulf of Alaska in the winter. Its cool, moist air mass experience orographic lift as it immediately rises through the mountains and deposits large quantities of precipitation. Hucuktlis Lake, inland from Broken Group in Barclay Sound, is one of the wettest places on Earth. The park area averages over of precipitation per year. Affected by the Kuroshio Current, the sea water temperatures range from in January to in August. In the summer the jet stream bring high pressure systems, with warmer air masses that retains moisture, in from the mid-Pacific resulting in drier, sunny summers. The air temperatures generally range from .
==Ecology==
===Inland ecology===

The terrestrial portion of the park lies within what the province terms the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone (very wet hypermaritime subzone), based on the climax vegetation. The wet, temperate and cool climate results in temperate rainforest conditions. The area&#x27;s exposure to strong winds in the winter, sunny summers and low elevations make the large and sturdy western hemlock, Sitka spruce and western red-cedar the dominant tree species. There understory is dominated by moss (like Sphagnum), lichen and ferns (like deer fern and sword ferns). The forest is home to black bears, Vancouver Island cougar, Roosevelt elk, and marten, as well as numerous invertebrates like the banana slug and warty jumping-slug and birds like the marbled murrelet and the olive-sided flycatcher. Vancouver Island wolves are even present on the islands of the Broken Group. Six species of salmon are present in the park&#x27;s watercourses, but are predominantly coho and sockeye. Cutthroat trout, red-legged frog, western toad, mink and river otter live in the lakes and wetland areas.

The park also protects Cheewhat Giant, a western red cedar tree that is the largest known tree in Canada and one of the largest trees in the world.

===Coastal ecology===

The shoreline&#x27;s sand dune habitat consists of pink and yellow sand-verbena, dune grass, seaside centipede lichen, black oystercatchers, and glaucous-winged gulls. The intertidal zone provides habitat for eelgrass, Aggregating anemone, echinoderms (like the western sand dollar and ochre sea star), sea snails (like the northern abalone), and crabs. Native bivalvia like butter clam, littleneck clam, California mussel and Olympia oyster compete with the invasive Manila clam, varnish clam, and Pacific oyster.

The park also includes a subtidal area where there exists several kelp forests, habitat for Steller sea lions, seals and porpoises, and parts of migratory routes for killer whales, humpback whales, grey whales, basking sharks, and pacific herring.

<text>Nirvana is a greatest hits album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on October 29, 2002. It was the third Nirvana album released following the death of lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain in 1994.

The album includes songs from Nirvana&#x27;s three studio albums, &quot;Bleach&quot;, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, and &quot;In Utero&quot;, and the live album &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;. Additionally, it includes the previously unreleased song &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot;, recorded in 1994 during Nirvana&#x27;s final studio session. It also includes a version of &quot;Been a Son&quot; that was previously only available on a UK limited release, and the Scott Litt remix of &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;.

&quot;Nirvana&quot; opened at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 234,000 copies sold. It has sold one million copies in the United States, and two million copies in Europe as of 2007.

==Background==
&quot;Nirvana&quot; was released following the settlement of a long-standing legal dispute between Cobain&#x27;s widow, Courtney Love, and surviving Nirvana members Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl.

The dispute was largely centered around &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot;, which Novoselic and Grohl had wanted to release on a long-delayed Nirvana rarities box set. However, Love blocked the song&#x27;s release, and sued Novoselic and Grohl over control of Nirvana&#x27;s legacy. Love&#x27;s lawsuit maintained that &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; was a &quot;potential &#x27;hit&#x27; of extraordinary artistic and commercial value.&quot; She believed the song would be &quot;wasted&quot; on a box set, and instead belonged on a single-disc compilation similar to the Beatles&#x27; &quot;1&quot;.

In September 2002, it was officially announced that the lawsuit had been settled, and that &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot; would be released on &quot;Nirvana&quot;, a greatest hits compilation or &quot;one-CD history of the band,&quot; in November, with the box set to follow in 2004. However, the release of the greatest hits set was pushed forward to October 29, 2002.

==Release==
The first song on the album&#x27;s otherwise chronological track listing is &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot;, which was also released as a downloadable single. It is followed by &quot;About a Girl&quot;, the only inclusion from Nirvana&#x27;s 1989 debut album, &quot;Bleach&quot;. The album&#x27;s producer, Jack Endino, originally saw the song as a potential single, and a live version, from Nirvana&#x27;s 1993 &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance, was released as a commercial single to promote the band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;. &quot;Been a Son&quot; was previously only available on Nirvana&#x27;s 1989 &quot;Blew&quot; EP, a limited UK release. The fourth song on the compilation is &quot;Sliver&quot;, which was released as a non-album single in 1990, the band&#x27;s final release on Sub Pop (the same version appears on the &quot;Incesticide&quot; compilation, released in 1992).

The next four songs, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, &quot;Come as You Are&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot; and &quot;In Bloom&quot;, are the commercially released singles from the band&#x27;s second album and major label debut, &quot;Nevermind,&quot; released in 1991. These are followed by &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;, &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; and &quot;Rape Me&quot;, three singles from the band&#x27;s third and final studio album, &quot;In Utero&quot;, released in 1993. The version of &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot; included is the remix by Scott Litt, which was prepared for the song&#x27;s single, but the single was recalled after Cobain&#x27;s death in April 1994. Prior to the release of &quot;Nirvana&quot;, this remix was only commercially available on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of &quot;In Utero&quot;, released in March 1994. The final studio track is the &quot;In Utero&quot; song &quot;Dumb&quot;, which was never released as a single, but has become a popular song on alternative rock radio stations.

The Northern American version of the album closes with two songs from &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;, &quot;All Apologies&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Sold the World&quot;, both of which were released as promotional singles from the album (the studio version of &quot;All Apologies&quot;, which appears on &quot;In Utero&quot;, was released as that album&#x27;s second single in 1993, as a double A-side with &quot;Rape Me&quot;). All non-US and Canadian versions of the album end with &quot;Where Did You Sleep Last Night&quot;, another song from &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;, from which it was also released as a promotional single. The Japanese version includes the &quot;Unplugged&quot; version of &quot;Something in the Way&quot;, which was released as a B-side to the &quot;About a Girl&quot; single in 1994, as the second-to-last track.

The album contains liner notes by music journalist David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

One month after the album was released, Cobain&#x27;s published &quot;Journals&quot; were released. The book debuted at No. 1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list (non-fiction), and its publishers stated that the simultaneous release of the &quot;Nirvana&quot; hits set helped fire cross-promotion at retail and that the album release was providence.

===Vinyl versions===

The original vinyl release of &quot;Nirvana&quot;, in 2002, was a rare 16-track European double LP that included the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; versions of &quot;Something in the Way&quot; and &quot;Where Did You Sleep Last Night&quot; as the final two tracks, similar to the Japanese CD version.

In 2015, the Northern American 14-track edition was released on vinyl for the first time, world-wide, as a double LP on 200-gram vinyl, packaged with a digital download card for 96 kHz 24-bit HD Audio, and as a single LP on 150-gram vinyl, with a download card for the album on 320 kbit MP4 audio. It was also released as a Blu-ray Pure Audio in high resolution 96 kHz 24-bit, available in three stereo audio formats: PCM, DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD stereo.

==Critical reception==

Several critics believed that &quot;Nirvana&quot; was too brief, and omitted key tracks. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of &quot;AllMusic&quot; wrote that &quot;the presence of a few more tracks, along with placing &#x27;You Know You&#x27;re Right&#x27; at the end where it belongs, would have made this collection not just stronger, but possibly definitive. As it stands, it feels like a bit of a cheap compromise and a wasted opportunity.&quot; Will Bryant of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called the album &quot;an artful selection of the band&#x27;s most seminal material&quot;, but also dismissed it as &quot;a party mix for parents who want to appreciate Cobain&#x27;s Lennon-esque knack for great melodies without having to click past &#x27;Scentless Apprentice&#x27; or &#x27;Territorial Pissings&#x27;...utterly inoffensive: an impulse buy from Columbia House, perhaps, with no more artistic value than the Eagles&#x27; &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; or the Beatles&#x27; &quot;1&quot;.&quot;

In 2019, the &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Nirvana&quot; at number 24 on their &quot;28 Best Greatest Hits albums&quot; list.

<text>Tofino Air is a small Canadian airline offering floatplane service from Tofino, British Columbia. It offers scheduled services, scenic tours, and specialized charters.

==History==
In the early 1990s, the owner of Tofino Air, and a lifelong resident of British Columbia&#x27;s Sunshine Coast, started a small regional airline called Midcoast Air, to better assure safety and dependability for himself and his co-workers as they travelled from the logging and fishing camps on BC&#x27;s west coast, to their homes on the Sunshine Coast. In 1998, Midcoast Air re-located to Sechelt.

In January 2001, Tofino Air purchased Pacific Spirit Air based in Silva Bay on Gabriola Island. After purchasing Pacific Spirit Air, Tofino Air increased its daily routes by adding in scheduled flights from Gabriola Island to Vancouver International Water Airport. The airline also continued offering daily scheduled flights between Departure Bay in Nanaimo and Sechelt/Porpoise Bay.

In April 2011, Tofino Air moved from its location in Departure Bay to the Nanaimo Harbour Water Aerodrome where it began to offer scheduled flights between Nanaimo and Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre. In late May 2011, Tofino Air was one of the first airlines to move into the new Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre, All flights from Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre have been cancelled and charter flights are conducted at the Vancouver International Water Airport.

In December 2014, Tofino Air started a new subsidiary airline called Gulf Island Seaplanes to service the Gabriola Island Silva Bay to Vancouver International Water Airport using de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver aircraft from Tofino Air.

In August 2015, Tofino Air dropped service from Nanaimo Harbour Water Aerodrome to Sechelt/Porpoise Bay and a new subsidiary airline called Sunshine Coast Air took over all service using de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver aircraft from Tofino Air, while Tofino Air now only offers scenic tours, and specialized charters from Tofino and scheduled flights to Hot Springs Cove and Ahousaht from Tofino.

==Fleet==
The Tofino Air website does not list the de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter. The Tofino Air fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of September 2019):


Transport Canada lists two more de Havilland Beavers, both with cancelled registration certificates.

<text>The Amiga 4000, or A4000, from Commodore is the successor of the Amiga 2000 and Amiga 3000 computers. There are two models: the A4000/040 released in October 1992 with a Motorola 68040 CPU, and the A4000/030 released in April 1993 with a Motorola 68EC030.

The Amiga 4000 system design was generally similar to that of the A3000, but introduced the Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA) chipset with enhanced graphics. The SCSI system from previous Amigas was replaced by the lower-cost Parallel ATA.

The original A4000 is housed in a beige horizontal desktop box with a separate keyboard. Later, Commodore released an expanded tower version called the A4000T.

The machine is reported to have sold 11,300 units in Germany.

==Technical information==

===Processor and RAM===
The stock A4000 shipped with either a Motorola 68EC030 or 68040 CPU, 2 MB of Amiga Chip RAM and up to 16 MB of additional RAM in 32-bit SIMMs. There is a non-functional jumper that was intended to expand the &quot;chip RAM&quot; to 8MB. Later, third-party developers created various CPU expansion boards featuring higher-rated 68040, 68060 and PowerPC CPUs. Such hardware also typically offers faster and higher-capacity RAM (128 MB or greater).

===A4000-CR version===
Unlike previous Amiga models, early A4000 machines have the CPU mounted in an expansion board; the motherboard does not have an integrated CPU. Later revisions of the A4000 have the CPU and 2 MB RAM surface-mounted on the motherboard in an effort to reduce costs. These machines are known as the A4000-CR (cost-reduced) and the surface-mounted CPU is a 68EC030. The cost-reduced models also make use of a non-rechargeable lithium battery for real-time clock battery backup rather than a rechargeable NiCad battery. The NiCad backup battery is one of the most common causes of problems in an aging device that uses one because it has a tendency to eventually leak. The released fluids are somewhat corrosive and can eventually damage the circuitry.

===Graphics and sound===
The A4000 is the first Amiga model to have shipped with Commodore&#x27;s third-generation Amiga chipset, the 32-bit Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA). As the name implies, AGA introduces improved graphical abilities, specifically, a palette expanded from 12-bit color depth (4,096 colors) to 24-bit (16.8 million colors) and new 64, 128, 256 and 262,144 (HAM-8) color modes. Unlike earlier Amiga chipsets, all color modes are available at all display resolutions. AGA also improves sprite capacity and graphics performance. The on-board sound hardware remains identical to that of the original Amiga chipset (the Paula sound chip), namely, four DMA-driven 8-bit PCM channels, with two channels for the left speaker and two for the right.

===Peripherals and expansion===
The A4000 has a number of Amiga-specific connectors, including two DE-9 ports for joysticks, mice, and light pens, a standard 25-pin RS-232 serial port and a 25-pin Centronics parallel port. As a result, at launch the A4000 was compatible with many existing Amiga peripherals, such as MIDI devices, serial modems and sound samplers.

Like the just-earlier Amiga model, the 3000, the A4000 has four internal 32-bit Zorro III expansion slots. This expansion bus allows the use of devices which comply with the AutoConfig standard, such as graphic cards, audio cards, network cards, SCSI controllers, and later even USB controllers. One of the most notable hardware items of the era is the NewTek Video Toaster system which became popular in the 1990s for amateur and commercial desktop video production of standard-definition broadcast quality video, consisting of tools for video switching, chroma keying, character generation, animation, and image manipulation.

The three ISA slots can be activated by use of a bridgeboard, which connects the Zorro and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board IBM-PC-compatible hardware, including Intel 80286, 80386, or 80486 microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware. Compatible ISA cards may then be installed into the two remaining ISA slots.

Later, in an effort to offer modern expansion options third-party developers created replacement expansion boards for the A4000 which provide PCI slots allowing use of higher performance and widely available PCI hardware, such as graphic, sound, and network cards.

===Operating system===
The A4000 shipped with AmigaOS 3.0, consisting of Workbench 3.0 and Kickstart 3.0, which together provide a single-user multi-tasking operating system and support for the built-in hardware. Following release of AmigaOS 3.1 it became possible to upgrade the A4000 by installing compatible Kickstart 3.1 ROM chips. The later AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 releases were software-only updates requiring Kickstart 3.1.

AmigaOS 4, a PowerPC-native release of the operating system, can be used with the A4000 provided a CyberStorm PPC board is installed. Likewise, MorphOS, an alternative Amiga-compatible operating system, can be used with this hardware.

Variants of platform-independent operating systems, such as Linux and BSD, can also be used with the A4000.


===Specifications===
==Notable uses==
Digital Domain used an Amiga 4000 for motion control effects in films such as &quot;True Lies&quot;, &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, and &quot;Titanic&quot;.

<doc id="273923" wikidata="Q192231" url="?curid=273923" title="African golden cat">
<text>The African golden cat (Caracal aurata) is a wild cat endemic to the rainforests of West and Central Africa. It is threatened due to deforestation and bushmeat hunting and listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. It is a close relative of both the caracal and the serval. Previously, it was placed in the genus &quot;Profelis&quot;. Its body size ranges from with a long tail.

==Characteristics==

The African golden cat has a fur colour ranging from chestnut or reddish-brown, greyish brown to dark slaty. Some are spotted, with the spots ranging from faded tan to black in colour. In others the spotting pattern is limited to the belly and inner legs. Its undersides and areas around the eyes, cheeks, chin, and throat are lighter in colour to almost white. Its tail is darker on the top and either heavily banded, lightly banded or plain, ending in a black tip. Cats in the western parts of its range tend to have heavier spotting than those in the eastern region. Two color morphs, a red and a grey phase, were once thought to indicate separate species, rather than colour variations of the same species. Grey skins have hairs that are not pigmented in their middle zones, whereas hair of red skins is pigmented intensively red. Hair of melanistic skins is entirely black.

Skins of African golden cats can be identified by the presence of a distinctive whorled ridge of fur in front of the shoulders, where the hairs change direction. It is about twice the size of a domestic cat. Its rounded head is very small in relation to its body size. It is a heavily built cat, with stocky, long legs, a relatively short tail, and large paws. Body length usually varies within the range of . Tail length ranges from , and shoulder height is about . The cat weighs around , with males being larger than females.

Overall, the African golden cat resembles the caracal, but has shorter untufted ears, a longer tail, and a shorter, more rounded face. It has small, rounded ears. Its eye colour ranges from pale blue to brown.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Felis aurata&quot; was the scientific name used by Coenraad Jacob Temminck who described a reddish-brown coloured cat skin in 1827 that he had bought from a merchant in London. Temminck also described a grey coloured skin of a cat with chocolate brown spots that had lived in the menagerie in London. He named it &quot;Felis celidogaster&quot;. &quot;Felis neglecta&quot; proposed by John Edward Gray in 1838 was a brownish grey cat skin from Sierra Leone. &quot;Felis rutilus&quot; proposed by George Robert Waterhouse in 1842 was a reddish cat skin from Sierra Leone. &quot;Felis chrysothrix cottoni&quot; proposed by Richard Lydekker in 1906 was a dark grey cat skin from the Ituri Rainforest. A black cat skin from eastern Congo was proposed as &quot;Felis maka&quot; in 1942.

In 1858, Nikolai Severtzov proposed the generic names &quot;Profelis&quot; with &quot;F. celidogaster&quot; as type species, and &quot;Chrysailurus&quot; with &quot;F. neglecta&quot; as type species. In 1917, Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated both the African golden cat and the Asian golden cat to &quot;Profelis&quot;. This classification was followed by several subsequent authors.

Phylogenetic analysis of cat samples showed that the African golden cat is closely related with the caracal (&quot;Caracal caracal&quot;). These two species, together with the serval (&quot;Leptailurus serval&quot;), form the Caracal lineage, one of the eight lineages of Felidae. This lineage evolved nearly 8.5 million years ago. Because of this close relationship, the African golden cat has been placed into the genus &quot;Caracal&quot;.

Two African golden cat subspecies are recognised as valid since 2017:
*&quot;C. a. aurata&quot; (Temminck, 1827) − east of the Congo River
*&quot;C. a. celidogaster&quot; (Temminck, 1827) − west of the Cross River

=== Phylogeny ===
The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic relationships of the African golden cat:
==Distribution and habitat==
The African golden cat is distributed from Senegal to the Central African Republic, Kenya and as far south as northern Angola. It inhabits tropical forests from sea level to an elevation of . It prefers dense, moist forest with heavy undergrowth close to rivers but lives also in cloud forest, bamboo forests, and high moorland habitats.

In Guinea&#x27;s National Park of Upper Niger, it was recorded during surveys conducted in 1996 to 1997.

In Uganda&#x27;s Kibale National Park, an African golden cat was recorded in an &quot;Uvariopsis&quot; forest patch in 2008. In Gabon&#x27;s Moukalaba-Doudou National Park, it was recorded in forested areas during surveys in 2012. African Golden cats were recorded in Tanzania&#x27;s Minziro Forest Reserve in 2018 for the first time.

==Ecology and behaviour==
Due to its extremely reclusive habits, little is known about the behaviour of African golden cats. They are solitary animals, and are normally crepuscular or nocturnal, although they have also been observed hunting during the day, depending on the availability of local prey.

African golden cats are able to climb, but hunt primarily on the ground. They mainly feed on tree hyrax, rodents, but also hunt birds, small monkeys, duikers, young of giant forest hog, and small antelope. They have also been known to take domestic poultry and livestock.

===Reproduction===
Knowledge of the African golden cat&#x27;s reproductive habits is based on captive individuals. The female gives birth to one or two kittens after a gestation period of around 75 days. The kittens weigh . Their eyes open within a week of birth, and they are weaned at 6–8 weeks. They grow and develop rapidly in comparison with other small cat species. One individual was reported to be scaling a 40-cm wall within 16 days of birth, reflecting a high degree of physical agility from an early age. Females reach sexual maturity at 11 months of age, and males at around 18 months. In captivity, they live up to 12 years. Their lifespan in the wild is unknown.

== Threats ==

The African golden cat is threatened by extensive deforestation of tropical rainforests, their conversion to oil palm plantations coupled with mining activities and road building, thus destroying its essential habitat. It is also threatened by bushmeat hunting, particularly in the Congo Basin. A dead African golden cat was offered as bushmeat in Angola&#x27;s Uíge Province in May 2018.

==Conservation==
The African golden cat is listed in CITES Appendix II. Hunting African golden cats is prohibited in Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone. In Gabon, Liberia and Togo, hunting regulations are in place.

<text>Steve Fisk is an American, Washington-based audio engineer, record producer and musician. As a musician, he has been in bands such as the instrumental alternative/indie rock band Pell Mell and the electronic band Pigeonhed. He has long been associated with the Pacific Northwest music scenes, including grunge and the Sub Pop indie record label.

==Career==
Fisk made his solo debut in 1980 with contributions to the compilations &quot;Let Them Eat Jellybeans!&quot;, &quot;Sub Pop 5&quot; and &quot;Life Elsewhere&quot;. In 1982 Fisk joined the Portland-based instrumental band Pell Mell, which issued records on SST. After a move to San Francisco, the group disbanded in 1985 and a few odd turns landed him in Ellensburg, Washington where he produced the Screaming Trees&#x27; &quot;Other Worlds&quot;. In 1986, the group released &quot;Clairvoyance&quot;. Soon his credits appeared regularly on releases from the Sub Pop and K labels including early releases from Beat Happening and Soundgarden. 

In 1990 Fisk moved to Seattle, where he produced Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Blew&quot; sessions, followed by work with Some Velvet Sidewalk, Treepeople, The Reverend Horton Heat, Love Battery, Girl Trouble, Mary Lou Lord, The Afghan Whigs, Unwound, Seaweed, Steven &quot;Jesse&quot; Bernstein, Beat Happening, The Screaming Trees and remixes for Soundgarden. In 1993 he teamed up with vocalist Shawn Smith in the ambient soul duo Pigeonhed, issuing a self-titled LP on Sub Pop. 

He shifted to major label production in 1994, helming projects for Imij (for Liberty records), The Wedding Present (for Island records), Schtum (SonyUK) and The 360&#x27;s (RCA). A year later a reunited Pell Mell issued &quot;Interstate&quot; on DGC, and for the same label Fisk produced The Posies, Three Mile Pilot and Boss Hog.

In 1994, Pigeonhed recorded its second Sub Pop LP, &quot;The Full Sentence&quot;, yielding the oft licensed Battle Flag remix by the Lo Fidelity Allstars. It can be heard in &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, &quot;Forces of Nature&quot;, &quot;Dancing at The Blue Iguana&quot;, &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;, &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; as well as many Hollywood trailers. The original Pigeonhed version is featured in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Very Bad Things&quot; and &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;.

In 1996, Pell Mell were dropped. &quot;Nothing Lies Still Long&quot; was used in weekly episodes of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;. Other tracks from their last album &quot;Starcity&quot; were featured in &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. Other 1990&#x27;s work include recording sessions with Mudhoney, Geraldine Fibbers, Low, Soul Coughing, Damien Jurado, Lois, Agents of Good Roots, Maktub, Joan Osborne, The Halo Benders, and Heather Duby. His third solo album, &quot;999 Levels of Undo&quot;, arrived in early 2001 on Sub Pop.

In the 2000s Fisk produced more records for Heather Duby and Maktub as well as solo work with Reggie Watts. Reunion records for The Wedding Present and Harvey Danger. Major label records for Midnight Movies and James Jackson Toth. Indy records with Minus the Bear, Past Lives, Shoplifting, Mark Pickerel, Carrie Akre, Alicia Dara, Paul Manusos and Al Larsen.

In 2005 Fisk co-wrote and produced the score for the award-winning Kurt Cobain documentary &quot;About a Son&quot; with Ben Gibbard.

In 2010, Fisk began work with KK and his Weathered Underground, mixing their &quot;Introducing&quot; CD, as well as solo records for members Kyle O&#x27;Quin and Thomas Hunter. Other mix work included Quasi, Bitch and The Telephantasm remix for Soundgarden.

Between 2009 and 2011, Fisk composed two 16 channel ambient audio installations for the Experience Music Project&#x27;s &quot;Nirvana: Taking Punk to the Masses&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Look Away: The Lure of Horror&quot; exhibits.

In 2015 he received the Stranger Genius award in music. In 2018 he led the mixing team for the original score of the documentary &quot;My Country No More&quot;, about a North Dakota community&#x27;s resistance to oil infrastructure planned for their area.

<text>Catopuma is a genus of the Felidae containing two small cat species native to Southeast Asia, the Asian golden cat (&quot;C. temminckii&quot;) and the bay cat (&quot;C. badia&quot;).
Both have similar pelage, with solid reddish brown coloration on their backs and darker markings on the head. They also exhibit colour morphs ranging from various browns to gray to black. The Asian golden cat occurs from northeast India to Sumatra, and the bay cat lives only on Borneo. Both inhabit forested areas.

The closest living relative of &quot;Catopuma&quot; is the marbled cat (&quot;Pardofelis marmorata&quot;), from which the common ancestor of &quot;Catopuma&quot; genetically diverged around . The Asian golden cat and bay cat diverged from one another approximately , before Borneo separated from the neighboring islands.

==Taxonomy==
The name &quot;Catopuma&quot; was proposed by Nikolai Severtzov in 1858 with &quot;Felis moormensis&quot; as type species, which was described by Brian Houghton Hodgson.

<text>The American Cocker Spaniel is a breed of sporting dog. It is a spaniel type dog that is closely related to the English Cocker Spaniel; the two breeds diverged during the 20th century due to differing breed standards in the US and the UK. In the United States, the breed is usually called a Cocker Spaniel, while elsewhere in the world, it is called an American Cocker Spaniel to distinguish it from its older English cousin. The word &quot;cocker&quot; is commonly held to stem from their use to hunt woodcock in England, while &quot;spaniel&quot; is thought to be derived from the breed&#x27;s origins in Spain.

The first spaniel in America came across with the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620, but it was not until 1878 that the first Cocker Spaniel was registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC). A national breed club was set up three years later and the dog considered to be the father of the modern breed, Ch. Obo II, was born around this time. By the 1920s the English and American varieties of Cocker had become noticeably different and in 1946 the AKC recognized the English type as a separate breed. It was not until 1970 that The Kennel Club in the UK recognized the American Cocker Spaniel as being separate from the English type. The American Cocker was the most popular breed in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s and again during the 1980s, reigning for a total of 18 years. They have also won the best in show title at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on four occasions, the best in show title at Crufts in 2017, and have been linked to the President of the United States on several occasions, with owners including Richard Nixon and Harry S. Truman. In 2021, the cocker spaniel ranked 29th in registrations with the American Kennel Club.

The breed is the smallest of the sporting dogs recognized by the AKC, and its distinctly shaped head makes it immediately recognizable. In addition, there are some marked differences between it and its English relative. It has average working intelligence, although by being bred to a show standard it is no longer an ideal working dog. Members of the breed suffer from a wide variety of health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.

== History ==
The word &quot;spanyell&quot; is thought to date from the late 12th century when it was used to name a type of dog imported into England from Spain, with the &quot;span&quot; part of the word referring to the country of origin. Records from the mid-14th century show that selective breeding was already in place, with the breed being separated into two distinct types, called water spaniels and land spaniels. By 1801, the smaller variety of land spaniel was called the Cocker or Cocking Spaniel, so named for its use in flushing woodcock.

According to historical records, the first spaniel was brought to North America aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot; which sailed from Plymouth, England and landed in New England in 1620. The first Cocker Spaniel recorded in America was a liver and white dog named Captain, who was registered with the American Kennel Club in 1878. In 1881, the American Cocker Spaniel Club was formed; it would later become the American Spaniel Club (ASC) and is now known as the oldest breed club for dogs in the United States. The task of the club was initially to create a standard to separate the Cocker Spaniel in America from other types of land spaniels, a task which would take over 20 years, only being completed in 1905.

The dog considered to be the father of the American Cocker Spaniel was sired by the dog considered to be the father of the English Cocker Spaniel. Ch. Obo was bred to Ch. Chloe II, who was shipped to America while she was pregnant. Once in the United States, she whelped a dog who became Ch. Obo II. He differed greatly from the modern breed, being only tall and with a long body, but was considered to be an excellent dog of that era and became a popular sire.

Towards the end of the 19th century, the breed had become popular in America and Canada due to their dual use as a family pet and a working dog. In the early 20th century the breeders on either side of the Atlantic had created different breed standards for the Cocker Spaniel and the breed gradually diverged from one another, with the two becoming noticeably different by the 1920s. The American Cockers by now had a smaller muzzle, their coats were softer and the dogs overall were lighter and smaller. The differences were so apparent that in 1935, breeders founded the English Cocker Spaniel Club and restricted breeding between the two types of spaniel. The two types of Cocker Spaniel in America were shown together as one breed, with the English type as a variety of the main breed, until 1946 when the American Kennel Club recognized the English Cocker Spaniel as a separate breed.

===Return to the UK===
Initially in the United Kingdom there were a few American Cockers that had accompanied service personnel to American bases in the 1950s and 1960s. In addition, several came over with embassy staff and business people returning home.

The first UK Kennel Club registered American Cocker Spaniel was Aramingo Argonaught, born January 17, 1956, and bred by Herbert L. Steinberg. Two judges confirmed that the dog was an American Cocker and not an English Cocker before the Kennel Club permitted the dog to be shown. In the 1960s they were shown as a rare breed, which meant that they did not have a show class of their own and could only be shown in variety classes. This included Aramingo Argonaught, who was the first American Cocker Spaniel to be shown at Crufts in 1960 in a class entitled &quot;Any variety not classified at this show&quot;. In 1968, the KC agreed to have the breed shown in the category &quot;Any variety gundog other than Cocker&quot; and stated that the American Cocker was not a variety of &quot;Spaniel (Cocker)&quot;. There were around 100 registrations between 1966 and 1968.

In 1970 the breed was given a separate register in the Kennel Club Breed Supplement, as it was previously included in &quot;Any other variety&quot;. Registration numbers increased to 309 by 1970 following this full recognition.

===Notable American Cockers and popularity===
American Cocker Spaniels have won best in show at the Westminster Dog Show on four occasions, with the first win in 1921 by Ch. Midkiff Seductive. Ch. My Own Brucie won the title twice in 1940 and 1941, and became known as the most photographed dog in the world.

Brucie&#x27;s win in 1940 coincided with the American Cocker Spaniel becoming the most popular breed of dog in the United States, and they would remain the most popular until 1952. The breed won the title for the fourth time in 1954 with the victory going to Ch. Carmor&#x27;s Rise and Shine. The popularity of the American Cocker increased once again in the 1980s with it becoming the most popular breed again from 1984 until 1990. In more recent years the popularity of the breed has decreased, with it ranked 15th most popular by the American Kennel Club in 2005. The breeds most recent victory came in 2017 when it won the best in show title at Crufts.

American Cocker Spaniels have had several links to the United States Presidency. In 1952, an American Cocker Spaniel became a household name when United States Senator Richard Nixon made his Checkers speech on September 23. A parti-colored American Cocker Spaniel named Dot was one of several dogs owned by Rutherford B. Hayes; and a buff colored dog named Feller caused a scandal for Harry S. Truman when the dog was received as an unwanted gift with the President subsequently giving it away to a White House physician. More recently, a Cocker named Zeke lived with Bill Clinton while he was the governor of Arkansas.

== Appearance ==

The American Cocker Spaniel is the smallest dog recognized by the American Kennel Club as a sporting dog, being on average between high at the withers. It is a dog of normal proportions, with medium long silky fur on the body and ears, hanging down on the legs and belly (known as feathering). The ears hang down. The breed standard states that size over inches for males and for females is a disqualification at conformation shows. American Cocker Spaniels weigh around on average, with females of the breed usually weighing slightly less than the males.

The head of an American Cocker Spaniel makes the breed immediately recognizable, with the rounded dome of the skull, well-pronounced stop, and a square shaped lip. The drop ears are long, low set, with long silky fur, and the eyes are dark, large, and rounded. The nose can be black or brown depending on the color of the breed.

The coat of the breed come in a variety of shades with the colors being separated into three main groups: black/black and tan, any solid color other than black (ASCOB), and parti-color. The black variety is either all black, or with tan points on the dog&#x27;s head, the feet and the tail in a pattern called black and tan. The group known as ASCOB includes all other solid colors from light cream through to dark red, although some lighter coloring is allowed on the feathering according to standards. Parti-colored dogs are white with patches of another color such as black or brown, and includes any roan colored dogs. In addition, American Cockers coats can come in a pattern known as merle, which is not recognized by the American Kennel Club.

American Cockers have rounder eyes, a domed skull, shorter muzzle and more clearly pronounced eyebrows than the English Cockers, whose head is more setter-like. In colors, the roan colors are rarer in the American variety than in the English but the shade of buff which is common in the American is not seen in the English breed at all, although there are English Cocker Spaniels which are considered to be a shade of red. The English breed is also slightly larger, being between in height.

==Temperament==
Known as the &quot;Merry Cocker&quot;, the American Cocker Spaniel breed standard defines the ideal dog of the breed as being &quot;equable in temperament with no suggestion of timidity.&quot; The breed ranks 20th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, a rating that indicates good &quot;Working or Obedience Intelligence&quot;, or trainability. IQ tests run on a variety of breeds in the 1950s and 1960s showed that the American Cocker performed the best when tested on its ability to show restraint and delayed response to a trigger, a trait which was put down to the breed&#x27;s bred-in ability when hunting to freeze upon finding a bird before flushing it out on command. However, they proved to be the worst breed tested when it came to manipulating objects with their paws, for instance uncovering a dish of food or pulling on a string.

With a good level of socialization at an early age, an American Cocker can get along with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed seems to have a perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling.

Members of the breed were originally used as hunting dogs, but increased in popularity as a show dog. It was bred more and more in conformation with the breed standard, resulting in certain attributes, such as a long coat, which no longer make it an ideal working dog.

==Health==

A 2024 study in the UK found a life expectancy of 13.3 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The American Cocker Spaniel is one of the more commonly affected breeds for progressive rod-cone degeneration. An autosomal recessive mutation in the PRCD gene is responsible for the condition in the breed. A study in the US veterinary data found the American Cocker Spaniel to be predisposed to glaucoma with 5.52% of dogs having the condition, the greatest prevalence of all breeds.

American Cocker Spaniels can present with a nutritional form of dilated cardiomyopathy that is associated with low blood concentrations of the amino acid taurine. This form of dilated cardiomyopathy is in many cases reversible if the dog receives taurine supplementation.

The American Cocker Spaniel is predisposed to the following dermatological conditions: allergic skin disease, intertrigo, Malassezia dermatitis, melanoma, otitis externa, plasmacytoma, primary keratinisation defects, sebaceous adenoma, and vitamin A-responsive dermatosis.

The American Cocker Spaniel is predisposed to hypothyroidism.

A North American study looking at records of over a million dogs and 44,000 American Cocker Spaniels found the breed to have a lower occurrence of hip dysplasia with 0.87% compared to 3.52% overall.

<doc id="273946" wikidata="Q19208" url="?curid=273946" title="Legislative Council of Hong Kong">
<text>The Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, colloquially known as LegCo, is the unicameral legislature of Hong Kong. It sits under China&#x27;s &quot;one country, two systems&quot; constitutional arrangement, and is the power centre of Hong Kong&#x27;s hybrid representative democracy, though popular representation in the legislature has diminished significantly in recent years, along with its political diversity.

The functions of the Legislative Council are to enact, amend or repeal laws; examine and approve budgets, taxation and public expenditure; and raise questions on the work of the government. In addition, the Legislative Council also has the power to endorse the appointment and removal of the judges of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal and the Chief Judge of the High Court, as well as the power to impeach the Chief Executive of Hong Kong.

Following the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, the National People&#x27;s Congress disqualified several opposition councillors and initiated an electoral overhaul in 2021. The current Legislative Council consists of three groups of constituencies—geographical constituencies (GCs), functional constituencies (FCs), and Election Committee constituencies—and has been dominated by the pro-Beijing camp since an opposition walkout in 2020. The 2021 changes resulted in a drop in the share of directly elected representatives from 50% to 22% and an increase in the overall number of seats from 70 to 90, along with the establishment of a screening committee to vet candidates. Since 2021, it is widely considered to be a rubber-stamp legislature due to the lack of opposition representatives and its frequent passing of laws with minimal discussion.

The original two groups (GCs and FCs) had constitutional significance. Government bills requires a simple majority of the council for passage, whereas private member bills requires simple majorities in two discrete divisions of geographical members and functional members for passage. Therefore, the directly elected legislators (mainly from the GCs) had minimal influence over government policy and legislative agenda.

The historical Legislative Council of Hong Kong in the British colonial era was created under the 1843 Charter as an advisory council to the Governor. The authority of the colonial legislature expanded throughout its history. A parallel Provisional Legislative Council was put in place by China from 1996 to 1998 to pass laws in anticipation of the Hong Kong handover.

==History==

===Colonial period===
The Legislative Council of Hong Kong was set up in 1843 for the first time as a colonial legislature under British rule. Hong Kong&#x27;s first constitution, in the form of Queen Victoria&#x27;s letters patent, issued on 27 June 1843 and titled the Charter of the Colony of Hong Kong, authorised the establishment of the Legislative Council to advise the Governor of Hong Kong&#x27;s administration. The council had four official members including the governor who was president of the council when it was first established. The Letters Patent of 1888, which replaced the 1843 charter, added the significant words &quot;and consent&quot; after the words &quot;with the advice&quot;. The Legislative Council was initially set up as the advisory body to the governor, and for most of the time, consisted half of official members, who were the government officials seated in the council, and half of unofficial members who were appointed by the Governor.

After the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed on 19 December 1984 (in which the United Kingdom agreed to the handover of Hong Kong to the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 1 July 1997), the Hong Kong government decided to start the process of democratisation based on the consultative document, &quot;Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong&quot; on 18 July 1984. 

The first elections to the Council were held in 1985, followed by the first direct elections of the Legislative Council held in 1991. The Legislative Council became a fully elected legislature for the first time in 1995 and extensively expanded its functions and organisations throughout the last years of the colonial rule.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China government did not agree with reforms to the Legislative Council enacted by the last Governor Chris Patten in 1994. Therefore, it withdrew the previous so-called &quot;through-train&quot; policy that would have allowed for members elected to the colonial Legislative Council automatically becoming members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) legislature. Instead, the Beijing government resolved to set up an alternative legislative council in preparation for the return of Hong Kong sovereignty from Britain to China.

Before the 1997 handover of Hong Kong, rather than working through the 1995 elected colonial legislature, the government of China, through the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), unilaterally established, in 1996, the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) in Shenzhen, under the National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. 

The Provisional Legislative Council, seen as unconstitutional by the British authorities and boycotted by most pro-democracy legislators, was in operation from 25 January 1997 to 30 June 1998 and held its meetings in Shenzhen until 30 June 1997, when the PLC moved to Hong Kong and replaced the elected legislature from the 1997 handover of Hong Kong until the 1998 Hong Kong legislative election. Since 2000, the terms of the Legislative Council have been four years, with the exception of the 6th Legislative Council.

===Early SAR years===
The current HKSAR Legislative Council was established on 1 October 1998 under the Hong Kong Basic Law. The first meeting of the council was held in July of the same year. Five subsequent Legislative Council elections have been held — the most recent being held on 4 September 2016. The Democratic Party had briefly held the largest-party status in the early years of the SAR period, but its support was slowly eaten away by its pro-democracy allies such as The Frontier and later the Civic Party. In the 2004 election, the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) surpassed the Democrats as the largest party for the first time and has since held its superior status. Due to the indirectly elected trade-based functional constituencies which largely favour business interests — represented by the Liberal Party and subsequently the Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong (BPA) — the pro-Beijing camp has been able to keep the majority in the legislature despite receiving fewer votes than the pro-democracy bloc in the direct elections.

Article 68 of the Hong Kong Basic Law states that the ultimate aim is the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage. This and a similar article dealing with election of the Chief Executive have made universal suffrage for the council and the Chief Executive a dominant issue in Hong Kong politics.

In 2010, the government&#x27;s constitutional reform proposal became the first and only constitutional move to have been passed by the Legislative Council in the SAR era with the support of the Democratic Party after the Beijing government accepted the modified package as presented by the party, which increased the composition of the Legislative Council from 60 to 70 seats; adding five seats in the directly elected geographical constituencies and five new District Council (Second) functional constituency seats which are nominated by the District Councillors and elected by all registered electorates. The 2014 Hong Kong electoral reform proposal, which suggested the electoral method of the Legislative Council remain unchanged, was vetoed in 2015, after a massive occupation protest demanding universal suffrage — often dubbed the &quot;Umbrella Revolution&quot; — broke out in 2014.

The 2016 New Territories East by-election and September general election saw the rise of localist tide where a number of pro-independence candidates were elected to the council. In November, in Beijing&#x27;s fifth interpretation of the Basic Law since the 1997 handover, the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) disqualified two pro-independence legislators from assuming public office pursuant to Article 104. Four more pro-democracy and localist legislators were unseated in subsequent court cases. Returning officers also disqualified certain candidates who had advocated for Hong Kong self-determination, with or without option for independence, from running in the following by-elections; the government expressed support for such decisions.

===2019 crisis and 2021 overhaul===

The 2019 amendment of the extradition bill caused an historic political upheaval, where intensive protests erupted throughout the city in the latter half of the year, including the storming of the Legislative Council Complex on the 22nd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong on 1 July. In July 2020, in light of the pro-democrats&#x27; attempt to seize the majority of the Legislative Council in the midst of the largely unpopular Carrie Lam government, the government postponed the seventh general election, citing the COVID-19 spike. At variance with the four-year term set out in the Basic Law, the NPCSC decided in August that the sitting Legislative Council should continue with its duties for at least one year; however, the term of the upcoming LegCo would remain four years. In a November decision, the NPCSC disqualified LegCo members on grounds such as Hong Kong independence, Chinese sovereignty, and solicitation of foreign intervention, impacting four sitting legislators whose candidacies had been invalidated in the postponed election. After the disqualification, the 15 remaining pro-democracy legislators announced their resignation in protest, leaving the legislature with virtually no opposition.

On 27 January 2021, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping said that Hong Kong could only maintain its long-term stability and security by ensuring &quot;patriots governing Hong Kong&quot; when he reviewed a work report delivered by Carrie Lam. In March 2021, China&#x27;s National People&#x27;s Congress passed a resolution that authorised an overhaul of Hong Kong&#x27;s electoral system, including that of the Legislative Council. The reform would allow a new Candidate Eligibility Review Committee, composed entirely of principal officials from the Hong Kong government, to vet candidates for the Legislative Council and would increase its total number of seats from 70 to 90. However, the seats that were directly elected would be reduced from 35 to 20, the five directly elected District Council (Second) seats would also be removed, while an additional 40 seats would be elected by the pro-Beijing Election Committee and 30 seats would remain trade-based functional constituencies. Every candidate must have nominations from each of the five sectors in the Election Committee.

The seventh Legislative Council term, beginning in January 2022, made changes where lawmakers&#x27; names were replaced with &quot;a member&quot; or &quot;members&quot; in meeting minutes, a change which the Hong Kong Journalists Association said was negative and that &quot;One one hand, that would make it more difficult for the public to hold lawmakers accountable, and therefore affect how voters may vote.&quot;

In April 2023, a survey found that half of Hongkongers were unable to name any serving lawmaker, with another 12% naming somebody not a current lawmaker.

In May 2023, the Legislative Council voted with 100% approval to let the chief executive restrict overseas lawyers from national security cases, following attempts by the government to block Jimmy Lai from hiring Tim Owen as his defense lawyer.

In September 2023, a report found that at least 66% of all bills that were passed were done with less than half of all Legislative Council members present, below the 50% attendance threshold for a quorum.

==The Legislative Council Building==

The first meetings of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, from 1844 to 1846, were likely convened in the residence of Governor Pottinger (later to be the French Mission Building), still standing at Government Hill. From 1848 to 1954 (interrupted by renovation in 1928-9 and the Japanese occupation in 1941–5), it was housed on the upper floor of the Colonial Secretariat Building, Lower Albert Road, replaced in 1957 by the Annex to the Central Government Offices Main Wing, on the same site. In 1985, LegCo moved down to the nearby Old Supreme Court building () in Central Hong Kong where it remained until November 2011. It took up residence in its present accommodation at the Legislative Block of the Central Government Complex, Tamar in December 2011.

Unlike many other former and current Commonwealth legislatures, the Hong Kong Legislative Council does not have a ceremonial mace placed in its chambers. However, the high courts of Hong Kong use a mace to open sessions, and it represents the authority and powers of the court.

To provide a long-term solution to the space shortage problem facing both the Government and the Legislative Council, the Government commissioned the Tamar Development for the design and construction of the Central Government Complex, the Legislative Council Complex and other ancillary facilities in 2008. The Legislative Council Complex comprises a low block and a high block: the low block, which will be named the Council Block, mainly houses conference facilities including the Chamber, major conference rooms, and communal facilities such as library, cafeteria and education facilities. The range of education facilities for visit by the public includes video corner, visitors&#x27; sharing area, exhibition area, children&#x27;s corner, viewing gallery and access corridors, memory lane, education activities rooms and education galleries. The high block, which will be named as the Office Block, mainly houses offices for members and staff of the Legislative Council Secretariat. Officially opened on 1 August 2011, administrative staff had already taken occupation on 15 January 2011.

==Membership composition==
Under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes initiated by the National People&#x27;s Congress, the Legislative Council is now composed of 90 members returned from 3 constituencies: the Election Committee Constituency, Functional Constituencies and Geographical Constituencies by popular vote.

The term of office of a member is constitutionally four years except for the first term (1998 to 2000) which was set to be two years according to Article 69 of the Basic Law. The 6th Legislative Council&#x27;s term of office of over five years from 2016 is in direct violation of Article 69 of the Basic Law.

In both the 2008 and 2004 elections, 30 members were directly elected by universal suffrage from geographical constituencies (GCs) and 30 were elected from functional constituencies (FCs). In the 2000 election, 24 were directly elected, six elected from an 800-member electoral college known as the Election Committee of Hong Kong, and 30 elected from FCs. Since the 2004 election, all the seats are equally divided between geographical and functional constituencies.

According to The Basic Law, while the method for forming the Legislative Council shall be specified in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress, the ultimate aim is to elect all Council members by universal suffrage (Article 68 of The Basic Law of Hong Kong). However, under the 2021 overhaul, the seats that were directly elected would be reduced from 35 back down to 20, the five directly elected District Council (Second) seats would also be removed, while an additional 40 seats would be elected by the Beijing-controlled Election Committee and 30 seats would remain trade-based functional constituencies, reducing the proportion of directly elected seats from 50% to 22%. Additionally all candidates must now be approved by the HKSAR government via the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee. This has led to all parties that are not pro-Beijing declining to run in the elections, as it is now reasonable to assume that any pro-democracy candidates fielded that might be electable will be disqualified prior to the election.

===Geographical constituencies===
The Geographical Constituency (GC) seats are returned by universal suffrage. 20 seats of the Legislative Council are returned by GCs through single non-transferable vote with a district magnitude of 2 (&quot;binomial system&quot;). The binomial system was instituted by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress in its amendment to Annex 2 of the Basic Law on 30 March 2021.
Geographical constituencies were first introduced in Hong Kong&#x27;s first legislative election with direct elections in 1991. The electoral system and boundaries of GCs have since changed:

Between 1998 and 2016, the voting system adopted in GCs is a system of party-list proportional representation, with seats allocated by the largest remainder method using the Hare quota as the quota for election.

===Functional constituencies===
Under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes, 28 functional constituencies (FC) return 30 members. The Labour Functional Constituency returns three members by block voting. The other FCs return one member each with first-past-the-post voting.

The 2021 electoral reform saw the dissolution of District Council (First) and District Council (Second) FCs. Three existing FCs were reconstituted: the Information Technology FC reorganised as the Technology &amp; Innovation FC; the Medical FC and Health Services FC combined to form the Medical and Health Services FC. Two new FCs were established, namely the Commercial (Third) and the HKSAR Deputies to the National People&#x27;s Congress, HKSAR Members of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference, and Representatives of Relevant National Organisations FCs. Functional constituencies are now principally elected by body votes; the number of FCs with individual votes were reduced, together with elimination of mixed individual and body voting systems.

The following FCs were abolished in the 2021 electoral reform.

* Medical
* Health Services
* Information Technology
* District Council (First)
* District Council (Second)
Between 1998 and 2016, the Heung Yee Kuk, Agriculture and Fisheries, Insurance, and Transport FCs where a preferential elimination system is used due to the small number of voters. In the preferential elimination system, a voter must indicate preferences rather than approval/disapproval or a single choice. District Council (Second) uses the same voting rule in Geographical constituencies for the 5 seats.

Before the 2021 elections, neither the Heung Yee Kuk nor the Commercial (Second) FCs have held an actual election, as only one candidate has stood for each FC in every election since their establishment in 1991 and 1985, respectively.

===Election Committee Constituency===
The Election Committee constituency was one of the three constituencies designed in the Basic Law of Hong Kong next to the directly elected geographical constituencies and the indirectly elected functional constituencies for the first and second-term Legislative Council in the early SAR period. With the last British Governor Chris Patten&#x27;s electoral reform, the ECC was composed of all elected District Board members who had been elected in 1994. The Single Transferable Vote system was used in the 1995 election.

After the handover of Hong Kong, the ECC was allocated 10 seats out of the total 60 seats in the SAR Legislative Council, comprising all members of the Election Committee which also elected the Chief Executive every five years. The size of the constituency reduced to six seats in 2000 and was entirely abolished and replaced by the directly elected geographical constituency seats in the 2004 election. The plurality-at-large voting system was used in 1998 and 2000.

In the 2021 electoral overhaul, the Election Committee constituency was reintroduced, taking 40 of the 90 seats, almost half, of the Legislative Council with plurality-at-large voting system. The electorate is composed of all newly expanded 1,500 members in the Election Committee.

==Committee system==
In order to perform the important functions of scrutinizing bills, approving public expenditure and monitoring Government&#x27;s work, a committee system is established.

=== Standing Committees ===
* House Committee 
** Parliamentary Liaison Subcommittee
* Finance Committee
** Establishment Subcommittee
** Public Works Subcommittee
* Public Accounts Committee
* Committee on Members&#x27; Interests
* Committee on Rules of Procedure

===Panels===

* Panel on Administration of Justice and Legal Services
* Panel on Commerce and Industry
* Panel on Constitutional Affairs
* Panel on Development
* Panel on Economic Development
* Panel on Education
* Panel on Environmental Affairs
* Panel on Financial Affairs
* Panel on Food Safety and Environmental Hygiene
* Panel on Health Services
* Panel on Home Affairs
* Panel on Housing
* Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting
* Panel on Manpower
* Panel on Public Service
* Panel on Security
* Panel on Transport
* Panel on Welfare Services
==President of the Legislative Council==
From the establishment of the Legislative Council in 1843 to 1993, the Governor was the President and a member of the council, and until 1917 the Governor was required to act with the advice but not necessary the consent of the Legislative Council. The Letters Patent of 1917 changed such practice by requiring the Governor to act &quot;with advice and consent&quot; of the Legislative Council.

Under the Basic Law (Article 72), the President has the powers and functions to preside over meetings, decide on the agenda, including giving priority to government bills for inclusion in the agenda, decide on the time of meetings, call special sessions during the recess, call emergency sessions on the request of the Chief Executive, and exercise other powers and functions as prescribed in the rules of procedure of the Legislative Council. However, the president of the legislative council may not vote in most situations regarding government bills, and is encouraged to remain impartial towards all matters in the LegCo. The President of the Legislative Council has to meet the eligibility requirements set out in the Basic Law that he or she shall be a Chinese citizen of not less than 40 years of age, who is a permanent resident of the HKSAR with no right of abode in any foreign country and has ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than 20 years.

The President is elected by and from among Council members. The first President (1997–2008) was Rita Fan; the incumbent president, elected in 2016, is Andrew Leung of the pro-Beijing Business and Professionals Alliance for Hong Kong.

===Primacy of President===
In a controversial move directed at reining in democratic legislators (most of whom were elected by universal suffrage and six of whose seats had been vacated by a controversial court order of disqualification), amendments to the Rules of Procedure were passed on 15 December 2017 giving sweeping powers to the President to control the business of the legislature. Among them is the power to vet proposed motions and amendments to bills, require legislators to explain them and to reject or merge them. Prior notice must be given of any notice of motion and the President may reconvene the chamber immediately after any failure to meet quorum.

==Procedure==
The quorum for meetings of the council is half of all LegCo Members; while the quorum for meetings of a committee of the whole during second reading of bills is 20, i.e. only 22 per cent of membership, having been reduced from 35 on 15 December 2017.

After the 15 December 2017 amendments to procedure, a petition is to be submitted to the House Committee only with at least 35 signatures of members, effectively blocking democrat-sponsored scrutiny of government action.

=== Passage of Bills ===
Passage of bills introduced by the government require only a simple majority of votes of the members of the Legislative Council present; whereas passage of motions, bills or amendments to government bills introduced by individual LegCo members shall require a simple majority of votes of each of the two groups of members present: namely members returned by the Election Committee and members returned by functional constituencies and geographical constituencies.

Motions on amendments to the Basic Law require a two-thirds vote in the Legislative Council, without a specific requirement in each group of constituencies. After passing the council, the Basic Law amendment must obtain the consent of two-thirds of Hong Kong&#x27;s deputies to the National People&#x27;s Congress, and also the Chief Executive (the Chief Executive is vested with the veto power). The National People&#x27;s Congress reserves the sole power to amend the Basic Law.

Traditionally, the President does not vote. However, this convention is not a constitutional requirement.

==Elections of the Legislative Council==
Legislative Council general elections are held every four years in accordance with Article 69 of the Basic Law of HKSAR. The most recent election was held on 19 December 2021. The pro-Beijing camp had absolute control of the Legislative Council with the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) as the largest party.

==Seating arrangement==
In a typical Council meeting in the old Legislative chamber, members were seated to the left and front of the President&#x27;s chair in the Chamber patterned after the adversarial layout of Westminster system legislatures. The three rows to the right were reserved for government officials and other people attending the meetings.

At the new LegCo site at Tamar, members sit facing the President (and council officers) in a hemicycle seating arrangement.

At present, the Secretariat, headed by the Secretary General, provides administrative support and services to the Council through its ten divisions. In addition to being the chief executive of the Secretariat, the Secretary General is also the Clerk to the Legislative Council responsible for advising the President on all matters relating to the procedure of the council.

==List of Legislative Council compositions==
The following lists the composition of Legislative Council seats since its establishment:

The following chart lists the composition of the Legislative Councils of Hong Kong since the Special Administrative Region (SAR) period from 1998, the composition and diagram indicate the seats controlled by the camps (green for the pro-democracy camp and red for the pro-Beijing camp) at the beginning of the sessions.

== Officers of the Legislative Council ==
Services to members were originally provided by the Office of the Clerk to the Legislative Council which was part of the Government Secretariat. Additional support later came from other administrative units, i.e. the Unofficial Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils (UMELCO) Secretariat and its variants, in consideration of the gradually rising volume of work in Council business.

With the establishment of UMELCO in 1963, public officers were seconded to UMELCO to assist members to deal with public complaints and build up public relations with the local community. During their secondments, public officers took instructions only from Council members. The practice remained when the Office of the Members of the Executive and Legislative Councils (OMELCO) replaced UMELCO in 1986.

In 1991, the OMELCO Secretariat was incorporated. As a result of the complete separation of membership of the Executive and Legislative Councils, OMELCO was renamed the Office of Members of Legislative Council (OMLEGCO).

The Legislative Council Commission, a statutory body independent of the Government, was established under The Legislative Council Commission Ordinance on 1 April 1994. The Commission integrated the administrative support and services to the council by the Office of the Clerk to the Legislative Council and the OMLEGCO Secretariat into an independent Legislative Council Secretariat. The Commission replaced all civil servants by contract staff in the 1994–1995 session.

<text>Electronic test equipment is used to create signals and capture responses from electronic devices under test (DUTs). In this way, the proper operation of the DUT can be proven or faults in the device can be traced. Use of electronic test equipment is essential to any serious work on electronics systems.

Practical electronics engineering and assembly requires the use of many different kinds of electronic test equipment ranging from the very simple and inexpensive (such as a test light consisting of just a light bulb and a test lead) to extremely complex and sophisticated such as automatic test equipment (ATE). ATE often includes many of these instruments in real and simulated forms.

Generally, more advanced test gear is necessary when developing circuits and systems than is needed when doing production testing or when troubleshooting existing production units in the field.

==Types of test equipment==
===Basic equipment===

The following items are used for basic measurement of voltages, currents, and components in the circuit under test.
* Voltmeter (Measures voltage)
* Ohmmeter (Measures resistance)
* Ammeter, e.g. Galvanometer or Milliammeter (Measures current)
* Multimeter e.g., VOM (Volt-Ohm-Milliammeter) or DMM (Digital Multimeter) (Measures all of the above)
* LCR meter - inductance (L), capacitance (C) and resistance (R) meter (measure LCR values)

The following are used for stimulus of the circuit under test:
* Power supplies
* Signal generator
* Digital pattern generator
* Pulse generator

The following analyze the response of the circuit under test:
* Oscilloscope (Displays voltage as it changes over time)
* Frequency counter (Measures frequency)

And connecting it all together:
* Test probes

===Advanced or less commonly used equipment===
Meters

* Solenoid voltmeter (&quot;Wiggy&quot;)
* Clamp meter (current transducer)
* Wheatstone bridge (Precisely measures resistance)
* Capacitance meter (Measures capacitance)
* LCR meter (Measures inductance, capacitance, resistance and combinations thereof)
* EMF Meter (Measures Electric and Magnetic Fields)
* Electrometer (Measures voltages, sometimes even tiny ones, via a charge effect)

====Probes====
* RF probe
* Signal tracer

====Analyzers====
* Logic analyzer (Tests digital circuits)
* Spectrum analyzer (SA) (Measures spectral energy of signals)
* Protocol analyzer (Tests functionality, performance and conformance of protocols)
* Vector signal analyzer (VSA) (Like the SA but it can also perform many more useful digital demodulation functions)
* Time-domain reflectometer (Tests integrity of long cables)
* Semiconductor curve tracer

====Signal-generating devices====

* Signal generator usually distinguished by frequency range (e.g., audio or radio frequencies) or waveform type (e.g., sine, square, sawtooth, ramp, sweep, modulated, ...)
* Frequency synthesiser
* Function generator
* Digital pattern generator
* Pulse generator
* Signal injector
===Miscellaneous devices===
* Boxcar averager
* Continuity tester
* Cable tester
* Hipot tester
* Network analyzer (used to characterize an electrical network of components)
* Test light
* Transistor tester
* Tube tester
* Source measure unit (SMU), a test tool capable to supply power and measure voltage or current at the same time.

==Platforms==
Several modular electronic instrumentation platforms are currently in common use for configuring automated electronic test and measurement systems. These systems are widely employed for incoming inspection, quality assurance, and production testing of electronic devices and subassemblies. Industry-standard communication interfaces link signal sources with measurement instruments in “rack-and-stack” or chassis-/mainframe-based systems, often under the control of a custom software application running on an external PC.

=== GPIB/IEEE-488 ===
The General Purpose Interface Bus (GPIB) is an IEEE-488 (a standard created by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) standard parallel interface used for attaching sensors and programmable instruments to a computer. GPIB is a digital 8-bit parallel communications interface capable of achieving data transfers of more than 8 Mbytes/s. It allows daisy-chaining up to 14 instruments to a system controller using a 24-pin connector. It is one of the most common I/O interfaces present in instruments and is designed specifically for instrument control applications. The IEEE-488 specifications standardized this bus and defined its electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications, while also defining its basic software communication rules. GPIB works best for applications in industrial settings that require a rugged connection for instrument control.

The original GPIB standard was developed in the late 1960s by Hewlett-Packard to connect and control the programmable instruments the company manufactured. The introduction of digital controllers and programmable test equipment created a need for a standard, high-speed interface for communication between instruments and controllers from various vendors. In 1975, the IEEE published ANSI/IEEE Standard 488–1975, IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation, which contained the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications of an interfacing system. This standard was subsequently revised in 1978 (IEEE-488.1) and 1990 (IEEE-488.2). The IEEE 488.2 specification includes the Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation (SCPI), which define specific commands that each instrument class must obey. SCPI ensures compatibility and configurability among these instruments.

The IEEE-488 bus has long been popular because it is simple to use and takes advantage of a large selection of programmable instruments and stimuli. Large systems, however, have the following limitations:

*Driver fanout capacity limits the system to 14 devices plus a controller.
*Cable length limits the controller-device distance to two meters per device or 20 meters total, whichever is less. This imposes transmission problems on systems spread out in a room or on systems that require remote measurements.
*Primary addresses limit the system to 30 devices with primary addresses. Modern instruments rarely use secondary addresses so this puts a 30-device limit on system size.

=== LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation ===
The LXI (LXI) Standard defines the communication protocols for instrumentation and data acquisition systems using Ethernet. These systems are based on small, modular instruments, using low-cost, open-standard LAN (Ethernet). LXI-compliant instruments offer the size and integration advantages of modular instruments without the cost and form factor constraints of card-cage architectures. Through the use of Ethernet communications, the LXI Standard allows for flexible packaging, high-speed I/O, and standardized use of LAN connectivity in a broad range of commercial, industrial, aerospace, and military applications. Every LXI-compliant instrument includes an Interchangeable Virtual Instrument (IVI) driver to simplify communication with non-LXI instruments, so LXI-compliant devices can communicate with devices that are not themselves LXI compliant (i.e., instruments that employ GPIB, VXI, PXI, etc.). This simplifies building and operating hybrid configurations of instruments.

LXI instruments sometimes employ scripting using embedded test script processors for configuring test and measurement applications. Script-based instruments provide architectural flexibility, improved performance, and lower cost for many applications. Scripting enhances the benefits of LXI instruments, and LXI offers features that both enable and enhance scripting. Although the current LXI standards for instrumentation do not require that instruments be programmable or implement scripting, several features in the LXI specification anticipate programmable instruments and provide useful functionality that enhances scripting&#x27;s capabilities on LXI-compliant instruments.

=== VME eXtensions for Instrumentation ===
VME eXtensions for Instrumentation (VXI) are an electrical and mechanical standard used mainly with automatic test equipment (ATE). VXI allows equipment from different vendors to work together in a common control and packaging environment. VPX (a.k.a. VITA 46) is an ANSI standard based on the VMEbus with support for switched fabric using a high speed connector. VXI combines VMEbus specifications with features from the general-purpose interface bus (GPIB) to meet the needs of instrumentation applications. Other technologies for VME, VPX and VXI controllers and processors may also be available.

Selecting VME, VPX and VXI bus interfaces and adapters requires an analysis of available technologies. The original VME bus (VMEbus) uses Eurocards, rugged circuit boards that provide a 96-pin plug instead of an edge connector for durability. VME64 is an expanded version of the VMEbus that provides 64-bit data transfers and addressing. VME64 features include asynchronous data transfers, an addressing range between 16 and 40 bits, data path widths between 8 and 64 bits, and a bandwidth of 80 Mbit/s. VME64 extended (VME64x) is an improved version of the original VMEbus that features a 160-pin connector family, 3.3 V power supply pins, bandwidths up to 160 Mbit/s, injector/ejector locking handles, and hot swap capability. VME160 transfers data at 160 Mbit/s. VME320 transfers data at a rate of 320 Mbit/s. VXI combines VMEbus specifications with features from the general-purpose interface bus (GPIB) to meet the needs of instrumentation applications. VME, VPX and VXI bus interfaces and adapters for VPX applications are also available.

=== PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation ===
PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation, (PXI), is a peripheral bus specialized for data acquisition and real-time control systems. Introduced in 1997, PXI uses the CompactPCI 3U and 6U form factors and adds trigger lines, a local bus, and other functions suited for measurement applications. PXI hardware and software specifications are developed and maintained by the PXI Systems Alliance. More than 50 manufacturers around the world produce PXI hardware.

=== Universal Serial Bus ===
The Universal Serial Bus (USB) connects peripheral devices, such as keyboards and mice, to PCs. The USB is a Plug and Play bus that can handle up to 127 devices on one port, and has a theoretical maximum throughput of 480 Mbit/s (high-speed USB defined by the USB 2.0 specification). Because USB ports are standard features of PCs, they are a natural evolution of conventional serial port technology. However, it is not widely used in building industrial test and measurement systems for several reasons (e.g., USB cables are rarely industrial grade, are noise sensitive, are not positively attached and so are rather easily detachable, and the maximum distance between the controller and device is limited to a few meters). Like some other connections, USB is primarily used for applications in a laboratory setting that do not require a rugged bus connection.

=== RS-232 ===
RS-232 is a specification for serial communication that is popular in analytical and scientific instruments, as well for controlling peripherals such as printers. Unlike GPIB, with the RS-232 interface, it is possible to connect and control only one device at a time. RS-232 is also a relatively slow interface with typical data rates of less than 20 kB/s. RS-232 is best suited for laboratory applications compatible with a slower, less rugged connection.

=== Test script processors and a channel expansion bus ===
One of the most recently developed test system platforms employs instrumentation equipped with onboard test script processors combined with a high-speed bus. In this approach, one “master” instrument runs a test script (a small program) that controls the operation of the various “slave” instruments in the test system, to which it is linked via a high-speed LAN-based trigger synchronization and inter-unit communication bus. Scripting is writing programs in a scripting language to coordinate a sequence of actions.

This approach is optimized for small message transfers that are characteristic of test and measurement applications. With very little network overhead and a 100 Mbit/s data rate, it is significantly faster than GPIB and 100BaseT Ethernet in real applications.

The advantage of this platform is that all connected instruments behave as one tightly integrated multi-channel system, so users can scale their test system to fit their required channel counts cost-effectively. A system configured on this type of platform can stand alone as a complete measurement and automation solution, with the master unit controlling sourcing, measuring, pass/fail decisions, test sequence flow control, binning, and the component handler or prober. Support for dedicated trigger lines means that synchronous operations between multiple instruments equipped with onboard Test Script Processors that are linked by this high-speed bus can be achieved without the need for additional trigger connections.

==Test equipment switching==
The addition of a high-speed switching system to a test system&#x27;s configuration allows for faster, more cost-effective testing of multiple devices, and is designed to reduce both test errors and costs. Designing a test system&#x27;s switching configuration requires an understanding of the signals to be switched and the tests to be performed, as well as the switching hardware form factors available.

<text>American Thighs is the 1994 debut studio album by American alternative rock band Veruca Salt. The album features the single &quot;Seether&quot;.

==Background and release==
Singer-guitarists Nina Gordon and Louise Post started working together in 1992. They eventually formed Veruca Salt with bassist Steve Lack and drummer Jim Shapiro, and the four had been a full band less than a year when they signed with the independent label Minty Fresh. In 1994, they released the single &quot;Seether&quot;/&quot;All Hail Me&quot;. &quot;Seether&quot; became a hit on college and alternative radio stations, and the band recorded the album &quot;American Thighs&quot; with producer Brad Wood. The album was released through Minty Fresh on September 27, 1994, the title is a reference to a line from the AC/DC song &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;.

Veruca Salt then signed with the major label Geffen Records, which re-released the album. &quot;Seether&quot; became a hit on MTV. Two more singles, &quot;Number One Blind&quot; and &quot;Victrola&quot;, were released from the album, but neither matched the success of &quot;Seether&quot;. &quot;American Thighs&quot; was eventually certified gold.

==Critical reception ==

&quot;American Thighs&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Nick Kelly of &quot;Hot Press&quot; said, &quot;Given that this is their first record, you can&#x27;t help asking yourself how a band so young can sing songs so good.&quot; Eric Gladstone of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; wrote that &quot;the album works an infectious formula: thick harmonies layered over attack-formation guitars and drums, with lyrics shifting from childlike innocence to guiltless brutality.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it number 8 on its list of the 20 best albums of 1994.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called &quot;American Thighs&quot; &quot;a pure pop album masquerading as the next big thing.&quot; In 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 21 on its list of the 40 best alternative rock albums of 1994.

<doc id="273965" wikidata="Q450262" url="?curid=273965" title="Gaspar Llamazares">
<text>Gaspar Llamazares Trigo (; born 28 November 1957) is a Spanish politician. He was the leader of the leftist coalition United Left (IU) from 2001 to 2008, as the General Coordinator.

== Early years and career ==
Llamazares was born in Logroño, La Rioja, Spain. Second of six brothers and sisters, he spent his childhood and youth in Salinas, Castrillón, Asturias. He studied medicine in the Autonomous University of Madrid and in the University of Oviedo, where he received his degree. There, he founded &quot;Bocetos&quot; (&quot;sketches&quot;), a medical publication attempting to focus especially on the social issues of medicine, unlike the biological paradigms then dominating in medicine. He then completed his studies with a Masters in Public Health in the University of Havana, in Cuba. In 1985, back in Spain, he started teaching in the University of Santiago de Compostela, and then in the Unidad Docente de Medicina de Familia in Cazoña (Cantabria).

== Early political career ==
He joined the Communist Party in 1981. In 1988, he was elected Secretary General and General Coordinator of Izquierda Unida in Asturias. In 1991, he was elected deputy to the regional parliament of Asturias, where he was spokesman for Izquierda Unida&#x27;s group. In this chamber, IU worked with governments of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party until 1995.

Llamazares was the General Secretary of the PCE in the autonomous community of Asturias, and member of Asturias&#x27; Parliament between 1988 and 2000.

== Later political career ==
Llamazares was elected deputy in the Spanish Congress for the constituency of Asturias in the 2000 General Elections. Following the poor results obtained by IU in that elections (20 deputies in 1996, and 8 in 2000), Llamazares announced his intentions to run for the post of General Coordinator in the Coalition&#x27;s sixth Federal Assembly due to be held December that year. During the Assembly, the post was contested by Francisco Frutos, Secretary General of the Communist Party of Spain, and Angeles Maestro, who was supported by the most radical factions of IU, along with Llamazares, who was supported by the then General Coordinator Julio Anguita. In the Election for the Political Committee, the list backing Llamazares obtained 32 seats, whilst the list backing Frutos obtained 30 seats, and the list backing Maestro obtained 13 seats. In the following General Coordinator election, Maestro&#x27;s supporters abstained, allowing Llamazares to be elected as General Coordinator. Being the General Coordinator, Llamazares was also designated as IU&#x27;s parliamentary leader.

Llamazares was re-elected General Coordinator in the seventh Federal Assembly of IU held in December 2003, being opposed by Luis Carlos Rejon, then Deputy for Cordoba, who was backed by several regional minorities, along with the new leftist faction &quot;Espacio Alternativo&quot;, and Juan Manuel Sanchez Gordillo Mayor of Marinaleda, Seville, who was supported by the more radical factions of IU (mainly Corriente Roja and CUT). Llamazares obtained a clear majority and was appointed Prime Ministerial candidate.

In the 2004 general election, Llamazares was elected Deputy for Madrid (as it is tradition for the Prime Ministerial Candidates of the national parties to be candidates for Madrid), but IU obtained its worst result ever with only 3 seats in Congress (5 in coalition with Initiative for Catalonia Greens). This led to a large number of IU members blaming the results on Llamazares. In the 2004 European Parliament election, IU won only 1 Member of the European Parliament from the previous 4 in 1999 (IU was in a joint list with Initiative For Catalonia that won 2 MEPs - one for each - that joined separate groups in the European Parliament). That led to Llamazares to call for an Extraordinary Assembly.

In the eighth (Extraordinary) Assembly of IU, Llamazares, who was backed by the more centrist Factions of IU as well as the Green-left factions and the more nationalist leaning factions, was opposed by Enrique Santiago, a human rights lawyer initially supported by the young cadres, and later Communist Party of Spain leadership, and Sebastian Martin Recio, Mayor of Carmona, Seville, supported by the Andalusian minority as well as &quot;Espacio Alternativo&quot;. (Previously, Santiago and Martin Recio reached an agreement to vote in the most supported of both in the political council. Llamazares won 54 seats, while Santiago won 42, and Martin Recio 14. The sum of Santiago and Martin Recio lists gave the first 56 votes. But a last-hour amendment introduced during the assembly to the IU by-laws, giving the General Coordinators of the Federations the right to vote for the General Coordinator, threw a result of 67 for Llamazares, 51 against, and 8 abstentions, allowing Llamzares to be re-elected as Coordinator General.

In May 2007, prior to the Municipal Elections, Llamazares Became the first national political leader to campaign through Second Life. During the electoral campaign, Llamazares announced he will not re-run as candidate for General Coordinator of IU in the following Assembly, supposedly scheduled for autumn that year. In July 2007, Llamazares announced he will intend to run once more as candidate for prime minister, a decision that caused several controversies inside the organization, specially amongst the Communist Party of Spain, and other sectors considered to be on the left of IU, along with that it was announced that the upcoming general assembly will be postponed to after the General Election, scheduled for March 2008. On October, Marga Sanz, a member of the Communist Party of Spain&#x27;s Standing Committee and its General Secretary in the Valencian Community, announced her intention to run against Llamazares for IU&#x27;s nomination to prime ministership. Primary elections were held in the last weeks of October and the beginning of November 2007, with Llamazares victorious.

In March 2008, in the immediate aftermath of IU&#x27;s worst-ever General Election results, Llamazares announced his intention not to seek re-election to the leadership of IU, finally resigning on 25 October 2008, three weeks before the 9th Federal Assembly of IU that will elect his successor.

In 2009, he sought to publicly condemn Pope Benedict XVI for having argued that condoms may in fact do more harm than good in the fight against AIDS.

On 15 January 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation published digitally-aged pictures of Osama bin Laden and Atiyah Abd Al-Rahman on its website which they claimed were produced using cutting-edge technology. Spanish newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot; revealed that a picture of Llamazares was taken from Google Images, and his hair and facial stubble was used to create the image. The FBI has admitted to this, and removed the image. An internal investigation has been launched by the FBI to find out if this was done intentionally.

<text>Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Frutos Gras (6 September 1939 – 26 July 2020) was a Spanish politician who served, from 1998 until 2009, as the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE).

== Biography ==
He was born on 6 September 1939 in Calella, province of Barcelona.
A son of peasants, Frutos worked until the age of 25 in agriculture, emigrating later to Germany, and then returning to Barcelona, where he was touched for the first time by trade unionism in a textile factory in Blanes. There, he was an organiser of the then-clandestine Workers&#x27; Commissions (CCOO). In 1963, Frutos joined the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC), the fraternal party of PCE in Catalonia. In the 1970s, he was elected organisational secretary of the Workers&#x27; Commission of Catalonia, and represented the union in the Assembly of Catalonia. Frutos was also a member of the Confederation Executive Committee of CCOO. In 1980, Frutos was elected a member of the Parliament of Catalonia, and in 1981, General Secretary of PSUC. He would remain in those positions until 1982 and 1984, respectively. During that period, Frutos oversaw different disputes between Leninists and eurocommunists, that led to the expulsion of the Leninist majority, including Chairman Pere Andarica, that would later become the Communists&#x27; Party of Catalonia.

After the resignation of Santiago Carrillo as General Secretary of PCE, and the election of Gerardo Iglesias, due to poor results in the 1982 elections, Frutos transferred to Madrid to work within the Structures of the Central Committee of the PCE. After the creation of United Left (IU) in 1986, Frutos was also a member of the Presidium of IU. In the 12th Congress of the PCE in 1988, Frutos was elected Organisational Secretary of the Party. In the 1993 elections, Frutos was elected a deputy for Madrid, and during the 13th Congress of PCE in 1995, Frutos rose to the position of Secretary of the Federal Committee, a position that substituted the position of Deputy General Secretary. In the 1996 elections, Frutos was second on the Madrid List of the IU, and succeeded in being re-elected. In 1998, the then-General Secretary of PCE and General Coordinator of IU, Julio Anguita, suffered a non-fatal heart stroke, and, following that, he announced his intention to gradually abandon active politics. In December of that year, the 14th Congress of PCE was convened, with Frutos elected to the position of General Secretary. In 1999, following Anguita&#x27;s second stroke, Frutos was asked to be IU&#x27;s Candidate for Prime Minister in the 2000 elections. Prior to the elections, Frutos signed a polemic agreement with Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), then led by Joaquín Almunia. In those elections, IU fell from 21 deputies to 8. Later in the Year, Frutos unsuccessfully disputed IU&#x27;s General Coordination to Gaspar Llamazares in the 6th Assembly of IU. Remaining as a deputy until 2004, Frutos was re-elected general Secretary of PCE in the 16th and 17th Congresses of PCE.

Frutos was a key-note speaker in the October 2017 Barcelona anti-independence demonstrations during which he denounced the independence movement as identitarian racism. The Communist Party of Spain disavowed him, alleging &quot;he does not represent us, from the Federal Committee we reject his attitude&quot;.

In July 2018, he took part in the event that launched Izquierda en Positivo, a political party that vowed to offer a &quot;left-wing and non-nationalist&quot; option.

He died on 26 July 2020.

<text>A bandage is a piece of material used either to support a medical device such as a dressing or splint, or on its own to provide support for the movement of a part of the body. When used with a dressing, the dressing is applied directly on a wound, and a bandage is used to hold the dressing in place. Other bandages are used without dressings, such as elastic bandages that are used to reduce swelling or provide support to a sprained ankle. Tight bandages can be used to slow blood flow to an extremity, such as when a leg or arm is bleeding heavily.

Bandages are available in a wide range of types, from generic cloth strips to specialized shaped bandages designed for a specific limb or part of the body. Bandages can often be improvised as the situation demands, using clothing, blankets or other material. In American English, the word &quot;bandage&quot; is often used to indicate a small gauze dressing attached to an adhesive bandage.

==Types==
===Gauze bandage (common gauze roller bandage)===
The most common type of bandage is the gauze bandage, a woven strip of material with a Telfa absorbent barrier to prevent adhering to wounds. A gauze bandage can come in any number of widths and lengths and can be used for almost any bandage application, including holding a dressing in place.

=== Adhesive bandage ===
=== Liquid bandage ===
===Compression bandage===

The term &quot;compression bandage&quot; describes a wide variety of bandages with many different applications.

Short stretch compression bandages are applied to a limb (usually for treatment of lymphedema or venous ulcers). This type of bandage is capable of shortening around the limb after application and is therefore not exerting ever-increasing pressure during inactivity. This dynamic is called resting pressure and is considered safe and comfortable for long-term treatment. Conversely, the stability of the bandage creates a very high resistance to stretch when pressure is applied through internal muscle contraction and joint movement. This force is called working pressure.

Long stretch compression bandages have long stretch properties, meaning their high compressive power can be easily adjusted. However, they also have a very high resting pressure and must be removed at night or if the patient is in a resting position.

===Triangular bandage===
Also known as a cravat bandage, a triangular bandage is a piece of cloth put into a right-angled triangle, and often provided with safety pins to secure it in place. It can be used fully unrolled as a sling, folded as a normal bandage, or for specialized applications, such as on the head. One advantage of this type of bandage is that it can be makeshift and made from a fabric scrap or a piece of clothing. The Boy Scouts popularized the use of this bandage in many of their first aid lessons, as a part of the uniform is a &quot;neckerchief&quot; that can easily be folded to form a cravat.

===Tube bandage===
A tube bandage is applied using an applicator, and is woven in a continuous circle. It is used to hold dressings or splints on to limbs, or to provide support to sprains and strains, so that it stops bleeding.

===Kirigami bandage===

A new type of bandage was invented in 2016; inspired by the art of kirigami, it uses parallel slits to better fit areas of the body that bend. The bandages have been produced with 3D-printed molds.

<doc id="273985" wikidata="Q1077486" url="?curid=273985" title="Tea for the Tillerman">
<text>Tea for the Tillerman is the fourth studio album by singer-songwriter Cat Stevens, released in November 1970.

==Overview==
Stevens&#x27; fourth album released during the year 1970, &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; includes many of his best-known songs such as &quot;Where Do the Children Play?&quot;, &quot;Hard Headed Woman&quot;, &quot;Wild World&quot;, &quot;Sad Lisa&quot;, &quot;Into White&quot;, and &quot;Father and Son&quot;.

Stevens, a former art student, created the artwork featured on the record&#x27;s cover.

In November 2008, a &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; was released featuring a second disc of demos and live recordings. In January 2012, a hi-res 24/192 kHz version was remastered using an Ampex ATR100 and a MSB Technology Studio ADC and released on HDtracks.com.

Fifty years after the original album&#x27;s release, in September 2020, Stevens remade the album as &quot;Tea for the Tillerman2&quot;, including new lyrics and new instrumentation, and he sings along with his 22-year-old self in &quot;Father and Son&quot;. That same year, &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; was re-released as a 50th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition. Along with five discs, the Super Deluxe Edition also includes a Blu-ray containing music videos, live videos, and audio of the 2020 mixes of the original album, as well as a 12&quot; vinyl record of live recordings by Stevens in 1970 at the Troubadour, Los Angeles.

== Critical reception ==

In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau found the music monotonous and lacking the &quot;dry delicacy&quot; Stevens exhibited on &quot;Mona Bone Jakon&quot; (1970). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ben Gerson said that Stevens&#x27; songs effortlessly resonate beyond their artfully simple lyrics and hooks, despite his occasional overuse of dynamics &quot;for dramatic effect.&quot;

In a retrospective five-star review, AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann praised Stevens&#x27; themes of spirituality and transcendence, and felt that he had continued to show his ability as a pop melodicist: &quot;As a result, &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; became a big seller and, for the second time in four years, its creator became a pop star.&quot; On 18 November 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included this album in its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list at number 206, number 208 in a 2012 revised list, and currently at number 205 on its latest list published in 2020. In 2006, the album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2007, the album was included in the list of &quot;The Definitive 200 Albums of All Time&quot;, released by The National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It was voted number 342 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot; was used as the closing title track of the British sitcom &quot;Extras&quot;.

The opening scene to a 2014 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Super Franchise Me&quot; parodied the artwork to this album, with the title track playing over it.

A previously unreleased version of &quot;But I Might Die Tonight&quot;, was used in the 1970 film &quot;Deep End&quot; in the opening and closing scenes. The version of the song used in the film was eventually released in 2020.

Four of the songs from this album were used in the 1971 film &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;: &quot;Tea for the Tillerman&quot;; &quot;Where Do the Children Play&quot;; &quot;Miles from Nowhere&quot; and &quot;On the Road to Find Out&quot;.

The song &quot;Father and Son&quot;, was used in the closing scene of the 2017 film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2&quot;. The song is also featured in the 2009 film &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot;.

<doc id="273988" wikidata="Q1435401" url="?curid=273988" title="Wireless local loop">
<text>Wireless local loop (WLL) is the use of a wireless communications link as the &quot;last mile / first mile&quot; connection for delivering plain old telephone service (POTS) or Internet access (marketed under the term &quot;broadband&quot;) to telecommunications customers. 
Various types of WLL systems and technologies exist.

Other terms for this type of access include broadband wireless access (BWA), radio in the loop (RITL), fixed-radio access (FRA), fixed wireless access (FWA) and metro wireless (MW).

== Definition of fixed wireless service ==
Fixed wireless terminal (FWT) units differ from conventional mobile terminal units operating within cellular networks such as GSM or LTE in that a fixed wireless terminal or desk phone will be limited to an almost permanent location with almost no roaming abilities.

WLL and FWT are generic terms for radio-based telecommunications technologies and the respective devices, which can be implemented using a number of different wireless and radio technologies.

Wireless local-loop services are segmented into a number of broad market and deployment groups. Services are split between licensed commonly used by carriers and telcos and unlicensed services more commonly deployed by home users and wireless ISPs (WISPs).

== Licensed Point-to-Point Microwave ==
Licensed point-to-point microwave was first deployed by AT&amp;T Long Lines in the 1960s for high-bandwidth, interstate transmission of voice, data and television. AT&amp;T&#x27;s network covered the entire U.S., carried across hundreds of microwave towers, largely transmitting at 3700–4200 MHz and 5000–6200 MHz. The network was slowly obsoleted, starting in the late 1980&#x27;s, as fiber optics became the solution of choice for communications backhaul.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Following the Breakup of the Bell System on January 8, 1982, licensed point-to-point microwave solutions could be sold to enterprise and government accounts for their own private use. Frequently, the argument was to bypass wired local loops in order to save money or backup weak copper cables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In 1987, Microwave Bypass modified a high-frequency licensed microwave radio (23GHz) and developed the first 802.3 wireless interface, dubbed the EtherWave Transceiver. The result was the first (FCC licensed) point-to-point microwave radio capable of delivering 10 Mbps Ethernet, full-duplex, between local and remote networks up to 4.3 miles apart. Distance limitation had more to do with 802.3 Ethernet latency than microwave range. Later, in 1988 Microwave Bypass teamed up with Cisco to create an end-to-end full-duplex connection that doubled the distance of the previous 4.3 mile limitation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then, the point-to-point microwave solution was referred to as, &quot;LAN extension over microwave&quot;, thereafter, &quot;wireless backhaul,&quot; and it was exclusively deployed for enterprise and government clients.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the 1990s, point-to-point microwave flourished under the growth of cell towers. This growth spurred research in this area, and as the cost continues to decline, it is being used as an alternative to T-1, T-3, and fiber connectivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Following the release of wi-fi IEEE 802.11, licensed point-to-point microwave became an addition tool for wireless internet service providers (WISP) and ISPs to close the Digital divide.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In 2017, a company called Climate Resilient Internet, LLC, formed to develop a new standard and certification for point-to-point microwave (&quot;fixed wireless&quot;) for enterprise and government resilience to extreme weather, grid outages and terror attacks. The company was co-founded by David Theodore, founder of Microwave Bypass, who pioneered the first use of point-to-point microwave for internet access.
== Licensed point-to-multipoint microwave services ==
Multipoint microwave licenses are generally more expensive than point-to-point licenses. A single point-to-point system could be installed and licensed for US$50,000 to US$200,000. A multipoint license would start in the millions of dollars. Multichannel multipoint distribution service (MMDS) and local multipoint distribution service (LMDS) were the first true multipoint services for wireless local loop. While Europe and the rest of the world developed the 3500 MHz band for affordable broadband fixed wireless, the U.S. provided LMDS and MMDS, and most implementations in the United States were conducted at 2500 MHz. The largest was Sprint Broadband&#x27;s deployment of hybrid networks equipment. Sprint was plagued with difficulties operating the network profitably, and service was often spotty, due to inadequate radio link quality.

== Unlicensed multi point wireless service ==

Most of the growth in long-range radio communications since 2002 has been in the license-free bands (mostly 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz). Global Pacific Internet and Innetix started wireless service in California in 1995 using Breezecom (Alvarion) frequency-hopping radio, which later became the standard 802.11.

A few years later NextWeb Networks of Fremont began deploying reliable license-free service. For Nextweb they originally deployed 802.11b equipment and later switched to Axxcelera, which uses proprietary protocol.

=== 1995–2004: License-free equipment ===
Most of the early vendors of license-free fixed wireless equipment such as Adaptive Broadband (Axxcelera), Trango Broadband, Motorola (Orthogon), Proxim Networks, Redline Communications and BreezeCom (Alvarion) used proprietary protocols and hardware, creating pressure on the industry to adopt a standard for unlicensed fixed wireless. These MAC layers typically used a 15–20 MHz channel using direct-sequence spread spectrum and BPSK, CCK and QPSK for modulation.

These devices all describe the customer premises wireless system as the subscriber unit (SU), and the operator transmitter delivering the last mile local loop services as the access point (AP). 802.11 uses the terms AP and STA (station).

=== 2002–2005: Wi-Fi local loop ===
Originally designed for short-range mobile internet and local area network access, IEEE 802.11 has emerged as the de facto standard for unlicensed wireless local loop. More 802.11 equipment is deployed for long-range data service than any other technology. These systems have provided varying results, as the operators were often small and poorly trained in radio communications, additionally 802.11 was not intended to be used at long ranges and suffered from a number of problems, such as the hidden node problem. Many companies such as KarlNet began modifying the 802.11 MAC to attempt to deliver higher performance at long ranges.
=== 2005–present: Maturation of the wireless ISP market ===
In nearly every metropolitan area worldwide, operators and hobbyists deployed more and more unlicensed broadband point-to-multipoint systems. Providers that had rave reviews when they started faced the prospect of seeing their networks degrade in performance, as more and more devices were deployed using the license-free U-NII (5.3/5.4 GHz) and ISM (2.4 and 5.8 GHz) bands and competitors sprung up around them.

=== The growing interference problem ===
Interference caused the majority of unlicensed wireless services to have much higher error rates and interruptions than equivalent wired or licensed wireless networks, such as the copper telephone network and the coaxial-cable network. This caused growth to slow, customers to cancel, and many operators to rethink their business model.

There were several responses to these problems.

====2003: Voluntary frequency coordination (USA)====
Next-Web, Etheric Networks, Gate Speed and a handful of other companies founded the first voluntary spectrum coordination, working entirely independently of government regulators. This organization was founded in March 2003 as BANC, &quot;Bay Area Network Coordination&quot;. By maintaining frequencies used in an inter-operator database, disruptions between coordinating parties were minimized, as well as the cost of identifying new or changing transmission sources, by using the frequency database to determine what bands were in use. Because the parties in BANC comprised the majority of operators in the Bay Area, they used peer pressure to imply that operators who did not play nice would be collectively punished by the group, through interfering with the non-cooperative, while striving not to interfere with the cooperative. BANC was then deployed in Los Angeles. Companies such as Deutsche Telekom joined. It looked like the idea had promise.

==== 2005: Operators flee unlicensed for licensed ====
The better capitalized operators began reducing their focus on unlicensed and instead focused on licensed systems, as the constant fluctuations in signal quality caused them to have very high maintenance costs. NextWeb, acquired by Covad for a very small premium over the capital invested in it, is one operator who focused on licensed service, as did WiLine Networks. This led to fewer of the more responsible and significant operators actually using the BANC system. Without its founders active involvement, the system languished.

==== 2005 to present: Adaptive network technology ====
Operators began to apply the principles of self-healing networks. Etheric Networks followed this path. Etheric Networks focused on improving performance by developing dynamic interference and fault detection and reconfiguration, as well as optimizing quality based routing software, such as MANET and using multiple paths to deliver service to customers. This approach is generally called &quot;mesh networking&quot;, which relies on ad hoc networking protocols, however, mesh and ad hoc networking protocols have yet to deliver high-speed low-latency business-class end-to-end reliable local-loop service, as the paths can sometimes traverse exponentially more radio links than a traditional star (AP → SU) topology.

Adaptive network management actively monitors the local-loop quality and behaviour, using automation to reconfigure the network and its traffic flows, to avoid interference and other failures.

== Mobile technologies ==
These include Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), time-division multiple access (TDMA), code-division multiple access (CDMA), and Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT). Earlier implementations included such technologies as Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS).

== Deployment ==

The wireless local loop market is currently an extremely high-growth market, offering Internet service providers immediate access to customer markets without having to either lay cable through a metropolitan area, or work through the ILECs, reselling the telephone, cable or satellite networks, owned by companies that prefer to largely sell direct.

This trend revived the prospects for local and regional ISPs, as those willing to deploy fixed wireless networks were not at the mercy of the large telecommunication monopolies. They were at the mercy of unregulated re-use of unlicensed frequencies upon which they communicate.

Due to the enormous quantity of 802.11 &quot;Wi-Fi&quot; equipment and software, coupled with the fact that spectrum licenses are not required in the ISM and U-NII bands, the industry has moved well ahead of the regulators and the standards bodies.

== WLL methods ==
* Mobile:
** CDMA (USA).
** TDMA (USA).
** GSM (ITU – Worldwide).
** UMTS 3rd Generation (World).
** Personal Handy-phone System (PHS in Japan, PAS/Xiaolingtong in China)
* Fixed or local area network:
** DECT, for local loop
** LMDS
** IEEE 802.11, originally designed for short-range mobile Internet and network access service, it has emerged as the facto standard for wireless local loop.
** WiMAX or IEEE 802.16 may become the dominant medium for wireless local loop. Currently more operators are running on the 802.11 MAC at 2 and 5 GHz. 802.16 was unlikely to outperform 802.11 until at least late 2008. Intel is promoting this standard, while Atheros and Broadcom are still focused largely on 802.11.
** Satellite Internet access for autonomous building.

<text>Carlton Draught is a 4.6% (abv) beer made in Australia by Carlton &amp; United Breweries, a subsidiary of Asahi Breweries.

==Description==

Carlton Draught is a draught Australian lager which is sold on tap Australia-wide, including its home state of Victoria, and is currently the fourth-most popular beer brand in Australia. It is also sold pre-packaged, Carlton Draught comes in 375 ml &quot;stubbie&quot; and 750 ml &quot;longneck&quot; bottles and 375 ml cans.

The formulation of Carlton Draught was changed slightly in 2003 to reduce the alcohol content from 5.0% to 4.6% in response to an increase in alcohol taxes by the federal government. The logo was also changed and a new advertising campaign was introduced to target a wider market. Featuring quirky, comical advertisements and billboards, the beer was promoted as simply being &quot;made from beer&quot;. Carlton Draught, like most Australian lagers, is made using a wortstream brewing process, and it uses a portion of cane sugar to thin out the body of the beer, apparently due to drinkers&#x27; preferences.

==Advertising==
The &quot;Carlton Draught: Big Ad&quot; used viral marketing techniques before being released on television.

A second comical viral campaign was initiated in September 2006 entitled Flash Beer. It is focused on a character named Kevin Kavendish (played by Aaron Bertram) applying for a job as a brewer in Carlton Draught. At first, he is rejected, so he copies a dance sequence in the movie &quot;Flashdance&quot; to the song &quot;Flashdance... What a Feeling&quot; and is accepted. The ad was parodied on &quot;The Chaser&#x27;s War on Everything&quot;.

Carlton Draught has been a sponsor of the Australian Football League since 1877 (except for 1991 and 2009) and used to be the main sponsor but was superseded by Toyota. It is the official beer of the AFL.

<text>corDECT is a wireless local loop standard developed in India by IIT Madras and Midas Communications (www.midascomms.com) at Chennai, under leadership of Prof Ashok Jhunjhunwala, based on the DECT digital cordless phone standard.

== Overview ==

The technology is a Fixed Wireless Option, which has extremely low capital costs and is ideal for small start ups to scale, as well as for sparse rural areas. It is very suitable for ICT4D projects and India has one such organization, n-Logue Communications that has aptly done this.

The full form of DECT is Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications, which is useful in designing small capacity WLL (wireless in local loop) systems. These systems are operative only on LOS Conditions and are very much affected by weather conditions.

System is designed for rural and sub urban areas where subscriber density is medium or low. &quot;corDECT&quot; system provides simultaneous voice and Internet access. 
Following are the main parts of the system.

DECT Interface Unit (DIU)
This is a 1000 line exchange provides E1 interface to the PSTN. This can cater up to 20 base stations. These base stations are interfaced through ISDN link which carries signals and power feed for the base stations even up to 3 km.

Compact Base Station (CBS) 
This is the radio fixed part of the DECT wireless local loop. CBSs are typically mounted on a tower top which can cater up to 50 subscribers with 0.1 erlang traffic.

Base Station Distributor (BSD)
This is a traffic aggregator used to extend the range of the wireless local-loop where 4 CBS can be connected to this.

 Relay Base Station (RBS) 

This another technique used to extend the range of the corDECT wireless local loop up to 25 km by a radio chain.

 Fixed Remote Station (FRS) 
This is the subscriber-end equipment used the corDECT wireless local loop which provides standard telephone instrument and Internet access up to 70 kbit/s through Ethernet port.

The new generation corDECT technology is called Broadband corDECT which supports provides broadband Internet access over wireless local loop.

<doc id="273993" wikidata="Q177929" url="?curid=273993" title="Stack (abstract data type)">
<text>In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two main operations:
* Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
* Pop, which removes the most recently added element.
Additionally, a peek operation can, without modifying the stack, return the value of the last element added. The name &quot;stack&quot; is an analogy to a set of physical items stacked one atop another, such as a stack of plates. 

The order in which an element added to or removed from a stack is described as last in, first out, referred to by the acronym LIFO. As with a stack of physical objects, this structure makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, but accessing a datum deeper in the stack may require removing multiple other items first.

Considered a sequential collection, a stack has one end which is the only position at which the push and pop operations may occur, the &quot;top&quot; of the stack, and is fixed at the other end, the &quot;bottom&quot;. A stack may be implemented as, for example, a singly linked list with a pointer to the top element.

A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept another element, the stack is in a state of stack overflow.

A stack is needed to implement depth-first search.

==History==

Stacks entered the computer science literature in 1946, when Alan Turing used the terms &quot;bury&quot; and &quot;unbury&quot; as a means of calling and returning from subroutines. Subroutines and a two-level stack had already been implemented in Konrad Zuse&#x27;s Z4 in 1945.

Klaus Samelson and Friedrich L. Bauer of Technical University Munich proposed the idea of a stack called (&quot;operational cellar&quot;) in 1955 and filed a patent in 1957. In March 1988, by which time Samelson was deceased, Bauer received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award for the invention of the stack principle. Similar concepts were independently developed by Charles Leonard Hamblin in the first half of 1954 and by with his (&quot;automatic memory&quot;) in 1958.

Stacks are often described using the analogy of a spring-loaded stack of plates in a cafeteria. Clean plates are placed on top of the stack, pushing down any plates already there. When the top plate is removed from the stack, the one below it is elevated to become the new top plate.

==Non-essential operations==
In many implementations, a stack has more operations than the essential &quot;push&quot; and &quot;pop&quot; operations. An example of a non-essential operation is &quot;top of stack&quot;, or &quot;peek&quot;, which observes the top element without removing it from the stack. Since this can be broken down into a &quot;pop&quot; followed by a &quot;push&quot; to return the same data to the stack, it is not considered an essential operation. If the stack is empty, an underflow condition will occur upon execution of either the &quot;stack top&quot; or &quot;pop&quot; operations. Additionally, many implementations provide a check if the stack is empty and an operation that returns its size.

==Software stacks==

===Implementation===
A stack can be easily implemented either through an array or a linked list, as it is merely a special case of a list. In either case, what identifies the data structure as a stack is not the implementation but the interface: the user is only allowed to pop or push items onto the array or linked list, with few other helper operations. The following will demonstrate both implementations using pseudocode.

====Array====
An array can be used to implement a (bounded) stack, as follows. The first element, usually at the zero offset, is the bottom, resulting in codice_1 being the first element pushed onto the stack and the last element popped off. The program must keep track of the size (length) of the stack, using a variable &quot;top&quot; that records the number of items pushed so far, therefore pointing to the place in the array where the next element is to be inserted (assuming a zero-based index convention). Thus, the stack itself can be effectively implemented as a three-element structure:

 structure stack:
 maxsize : integer
 top : integer
 items : array of item

 procedure initialize(stk : stack, size : integer):
 stk.items ← new array of &quot;size&quot; items, initially empty
 stk.maxsize ← size
 stk.top ← 0

The &quot;push&quot; operation adds an element and increments the &quot;top&quot; index, after checking for overflow:

 procedure push(stk : stack, x : item):
 if stk.top = stk.maxsize:
 report overflow error
 else:
 stk.items[stk.top] ← x
 stk.top ← stk.top + 1

Similarly, &quot;pop&quot; decrements the &quot;top&quot; index after checking for underflow, and returns the item that was previously the top one:

 procedure pop(stk : stack):
 if stk.top = 0:
 report underflow error
 else:
 stk.top ← stk.top − 1
 r ← stk.items[stk.top]
 return r

Using a dynamic array, it is possible to implement a stack that can grow or shrink as much as needed. The size of the stack is simply the size of the dynamic array, which is a very efficient implementation of a stack since adding items to or removing items from the end of a dynamic array requires amortized O(1) time.

====Linked list====
Another option for implementing stacks is to use a singly linked list. A stack is then a pointer to the &quot;head&quot; of the list, with perhaps a counter to keep track of the size of the list:

 structure frame:
 data : item
 next : frame or nil

 structure stack:
 head : frame or nil
 size : integer

 procedure initialize(stk : stack):
 stk.head ← nil
 stk.size ← 0

Pushing and popping items happens at the head of the list; overflow is not possible in this implementation (unless memory is exhausted):

 procedure push(stk : stack, x : item):
 newhead ← new frame
 newhead.data ← x
 newhead.next ← stk.head
 stk.head ← newhead
 stk.size ← stk.size + 1

 procedure pop(stk : stack):
 if stk.head = nil:
 report underflow error
 r ← stk.head.data
 stk.head ← stk.head.next
 stk.size ← stk.size - 1
 return r

===Stacks and programming languages===
Some languages, such as Perl, LISP, JavaScript and Python, make the stack operations push and pop available on their standard list/array types. Some languages, notably those in the Forth family (including PostScript), are designed around language-defined stacks that are directly visible to and manipulated by the programmer.

The following is an example of manipulating a stack in Common Lisp (&quot; is the Lisp interpreter&#x27;s prompt; lines not starting with &quot; are the interpreter&#x27;s responses to expressions):
&gt; (setf stack (list &#x27;a &#x27;b &#x27;c)) ;; set the variable &quot;stack&quot;
(A B C)
&gt; (pop stack) ;; get top (leftmost) element, should modify the stack
A
&gt; stack ;; check the value of stack
(B C)
&gt; (push &#x27;new stack) ;; push a new top onto the stack
(NEW B C)
Several of the C++ Standard Library container types have and operations with LIFO semantics; additionally, the template class adapts existing containers to provide a restricted API with only push/pop operations. PHP has an SplStack class. Java&#x27;s library contains a class that is a specialization of . Following is an example program in Java language, using that class.
import java.util.Stack;

class StackDemo {
 public static void main(String[]args) {
 Stack&lt;String&gt; stack = new Stack&lt;String&gt;();
 stack.push(&quot;A&quot;); // Insert &quot;A&quot; in the stack
 stack.push(&quot;B&quot;); // Insert &quot;B&quot; in the stack
 stack.push(&quot;C&quot;); // Insert &quot;C&quot; in the stack
 stack.push(&quot;D&quot;); // Insert &quot;D&quot; in the stack
 System.out.println(stack.peek()); // Prints the top of the stack (&quot;D&quot;)
 stack.pop(); // removing the top (&quot;D&quot;)
 stack.pop(); // removing the next top (&quot;C&quot;)
}
==Hardware stack==
A common use of stacks at the architecture level is as a means of allocating and accessing memory.

===Basic architecture of a stack===
A typical stack is an area of computer memory with a fixed origin and a variable size. Initially the size of the stack is zero. A stack pointer (usually in the form of a processor register) points to the most recently referenced location on the stack; when the stack has a size of zero, the stack pointer points to the origin of the stack.

The two operations applicable to all stacks are:

* A &quot;push&quot; operation: the address in the stack pointer is adjusted by the size of the data item and a data item is written at the location to which the stack pointer points.
* A &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;pull&quot; operation: a data item at the current location to which the stack pointer points is read, and the stack pointer is moved by a distance corresponding to the size of that data item.

There are many variations on the basic principle of stack operations. Every stack has a fixed location in memory at which it begins. As data items are added to the stack, the stack pointer is displaced to indicate the current extent of the stack, which expands away from the origin.

Stack pointers may point to the origin of a stack or to a limited range of addresses above or below the origin (depending on the direction in which the stack grows); however, the stack pointer cannot cross the origin of the stack. In other words, if the origin of the stack is at address 1000 and the stack grows downwards (towards addresses 999, 998, and so on), the stack pointer must never be incremented beyond 1000 (to 1001 or beyond). If a pop operation on the stack causes the stack pointer to move past the origin of the stack, a &quot;stack underflow&quot; occurs. If a push operation causes the stack pointer to increment or decrement beyond the maximum extent of the stack, a &quot;stack overflow&quot; occurs.

Some environments that rely heavily on stacks may provide additional operations, for example:

* &quot;Duplicate&quot;: the top item is popped and then pushed twice, such that two copies of the former top item now lie at the top. 
* &quot;Peek&quot;: the topmost item is inspected (or returned), but the stack pointer and stack size does not change (meaning the item remains on the stack). This can also be called the &quot;top&quot; operation.
* &quot;Swap&quot; or &quot;exchange&quot;: the two topmost items on the stack exchange places.
* &quot;Rotate (or Roll)&quot;: the topmost items are moved on the stack in a rotating fashion. For example, if , items 1, 2, and 3 on the stack are moved to positions 2, 3, and 1 on the stack, respectively. Many variants of this operation are possible, with the most common being called &quot;left rotate&quot; and &quot;right rotate.&quot;

Stacks are often visualized growing from the bottom up (like real-world stacks). They may also be visualized growing from left to right, where the top is on the far right, or even growing from top to bottom. The important feature is for the bottom of the stack to be in a fixed position. The illustration in this section is an example of a top-to-bottom growth visualization: the top (28) is the stack &quot;bottom&quot;, since the stack &quot;top&quot; (9) is where items are pushed or popped from.

A &quot;right rotate&quot; will move the first element to the third position, the second to the first and the third to the second. Here are two equivalent visualizations of this process:

 apple banana
 banana ===right rotate==&gt; cucumber
 cucumber apple

 cucumber apple
 banana ===left rotate==&gt; cucumber
 apple banana

A stack is usually represented in computers by a block of memory cells, with the &quot;bottom&quot; at a fixed location, and the stack pointer holding the address of the current &quot;top&quot; cell in the stack. The &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; nomenclature is used irrespective of whether the stack actually grows towards higher memory addresses.

Pushing an item on to the stack adjusts the stack pointer by the size of the item (either decrementing or incrementing, depending on the direction in which the stack grows in memory), pointing it to the next cell, and copies the new top item to the stack area. Depending again on the exact implementation, at the end of a push operation, the stack pointer may point to the next unused location in the stack, or it may point to the topmost item in the stack. If the stack points to the current topmost item, the stack pointer will be updated before a new item is pushed onto the stack; if it points to the next available location in the stack, it will be updated &quot;after&quot; the new item is pushed onto the stack.

Popping the stack is simply the inverse of pushing. The topmost item in the stack is removed and the stack pointer is updated, in the opposite order of that used in the push operation.

====Stack in main memory====
Many CISC-type CPU designs, including the x86, Z80 and 6502, have a dedicated register for use as the call stack stack pointer with dedicated call, return, push, and pop instructions that implicitly update the dedicated register, thus increasing code density. Some CISC processors, like the PDP-11 and the 68000, also have special addressing modes for implementation of stacks, typically with a semi-dedicated stack pointer as well (such as A7 in the 68000). In contrast, most RISC CPU designs do not have dedicated stack instructions and therefore most, if not all, registers may be used as stack pointers as needed.

====Stack in registers or dedicated memory====

Some machines use a stack for arithmetic and logical operations; operands are pushed onto the stack, and arithmetic and logical operations act on the top one or more items on the stack, popping them off the stack and pushing the result onto the stack. Machines that function in this fashion are called stack machines.

A number of mainframes and minicomputers were stack machines, the most famous being the Burroughs large systems. Other examples include the CISC HP 3000 machines and the CISC machines from Tandem Computers.

The x87 floating point architecture is an example of a set of registers organised as a stack where direct access to individual registers (relative to the current top) is also possible.

Having the top-of-stack as an implicit argument allows for a small machine code footprint with a good usage of bus bandwidth and code caches, but it also prevents some types of optimizations possible on processors permitting random access to the register file for all (two or three) operands. A stack structure also makes superscalar implementations with register renaming (for speculative execution) somewhat more complex to implement, although it is still feasible, as exemplified by modern x87 implementations.

Sun SPARC, AMD Am29000, and Intel i960 are all examples of architectures that use register windows within a register-stack as another strategy to avoid the use of slow main memory for function arguments and return values.

There is also a number of small microprocessors that implement a stack directly in hardware, and some microcontrollers have a fixed-depth stack that is not directly accessible. Examples are the PIC microcontrollers, the Computer Cowboys MuP21, the Harris RTX line, and the Novix NC4016. At least one microcontroller family, the COP400, implements a stack either directly in hardware or in RAM via a stack pointer, depending on the device. Many stack-based microprocessors were used to implement the programming language Forth at the microcode level.

==Applications of stacks==

===Expression evaluation and syntax parsing===
Calculators that employ reverse Polish notation use a stack structure to hold values. Expressions can be represented in prefix, postfix or infix notations and conversion from one form to another may be accomplished using a stack. Many compilers use a stack to parse syntax before translation into low-level code. Most programming languages are context-free languages, allowing them to be parsed with stack-based machines.

===Backtracking===
Another important application of stacks is backtracking. An illustration of this is the simple example of finding the correct path in a maze that contains a series of points, a starting point, several paths and a destination. If random paths must be chosen, then after following an incorrect path, there must be a method by which to return to the beginning of that path. This can be achieved through the use of stacks, as a last correct point can be pushed onto the stack, and popped from the stack in case of an incorrect path. 

The prototypical example of a backtracking algorithm is depth-first search, which finds all vertices of a graph that can be reached from a specified starting vertex. Other applications of backtracking involve searching through spaces that represent potential solutions to an optimization problem. Branch and bound is a technique for performing such backtracking searches without exhaustively searching all of the potential solutions in such a space.

===Compile-time memory management===

A number of programming languages are stack-oriented, meaning they define most basic operations (adding two numbers, printing a character) as taking their arguments from the stack, and placing any return values back on the stack. For example, PostScript has a return stack and an operand stack, and also has a graphics state stack and a dictionary stack. Many virtual machines are also stack-oriented, including the p-code machine and the Java Virtual Machine.

Almost all calling conventionsthe ways in which subroutines receive their parameters and return resultsuse a special stack (the &quot;call stack&quot;) to hold information about procedure/function calling and nesting in order to switch to the context of the called function and restore to the caller function when the calling finishes. The functions follow a runtime protocol between caller and callee to save arguments and return value on the stack. Stacks are an important way of supporting nested or recursive function calls. This type of stack is used implicitly by the compiler to support CALL and RETURN statements (or their equivalents) and is not manipulated directly by the programmer.

Some programming languages use the stack to store data that is local to a procedure. Space for local data items is allocated from the stack when the procedure is entered, and is deallocated when the procedure exits. The C programming language is typically implemented in this way. Using the same stack for both data and procedure calls has important security implications (see below) of which a programmer must be aware in order to avoid introducing serious security bugs into a program.

===Efficient algorithms===
Several algorithms use a stack (separate from the usual function call stack of most programming languages) as the principal data structure with which they organize their information. These include:
* Graham scan, an algorithm for the convex hull of a two-dimensional system of points. A convex hull of a subset of the input is maintained in a stack, which is used to find and remove concavities in the boundary when a new point is added to the hull.
* Part of the SMAWK algorithm for finding the row minima of a monotone matrix uses stacks in a similar way to Graham scan.
* All nearest smaller values, the problem of finding, for each number in an array, the closest preceding number that is smaller than it. One algorithm for this problem uses a stack to maintain a collection of candidates for the nearest smaller value. For each position in the array, the stack is popped until a smaller value is found on its top, and then the value in the new position is pushed onto the stack.
* The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm, a method for agglomerative hierarchical clustering based on maintaining a stack of clusters, each of which is the nearest neighbor of its predecessor on the stack. When this method finds a pair of clusters that are mutual nearest neighbors, they are popped and merged.

==Security==
Some computing environments use stacks in ways that may make them vulnerable to security breaches and attacks. Programmers working in such environments must take special care to avoid such pitfalls in these implementations.

As an example, some programming languages use a common stack to store both data local to a called procedure and the linking information that allows the procedure to return to its caller. This means that the program moves data into and out of the same stack that contains critical return addresses for the procedure calls. If data is moved to the wrong location on the stack, or an oversized data item is moved to a stack location that is not large enough to contain it, return information for procedure calls may be corrupted, causing the program to fail.

Malicious parties may attempt a stack smashing attack that takes advantage of this type of implementation by providing oversized data input to a program that does not check the length of input. Such a program may copy the data in its entirety to a location on the stack, and in doing so, it may change the return addresses for procedures that have called it. An attacker can experiment to find a specific type of data that can be provided to such a program such that the return address of the current procedure is reset to point to an area within the stack itself (and within the data provided by the attacker), which in turn contains instructions that carry out unauthorized operations.

This type of attack is a variation on the buffer overflow attack and is an extremely frequent source of security breaches in software, mainly because some of the most popular compilers use a shared stack for both data and procedure calls, and do not verify the length of data items. Frequently, programmers do not write code to verify the size of data items, either, and when an oversized or undersized data item is copied to the stack, a security breach may occur.

<text>A stack or sea stack is a geological landform consisting of a steep and often vertical column or columns of rock in the sea near a coast, formed by wave erosion. Stacks are formed over time by wind and water, processes of coastal geomorphology. They are formed when part of a headland is eroded by hydraulic action, which is the force of the sea or water crashing against the rock. The force of the water weakens cracks in the headland, causing them to later collapse, forming free-standing stacks and even a small island. Without the constant presence of water, stacks also form when a natural arch collapses under gravity, due to sub-aerial processes like wind erosion. Erosion causes the arch to collapse, leaving the pillar of hard rock standing away from the coast—the stack. Eventually, erosion will cause the stack to collapse, leaving a stump. Stacks can provide important nesting locations for seabirds, and many are popular for rock climbing.

Isolated steep-sided, rocky oceanic islets typically of volcanic origin, are also loosely called &quot;stacks&quot; or &quot;volcanic stacks&quot;.

==Formation==
Stacks typically form in horizontally bedded sedimentary or volcanic rocks, particularly on limestone cliffs. The medium hardness of these rocks means medium resistance to abrasive and attritive erosion. A more resistant layer may form a capstone. (Cliffs with weaker rock, such as claystone or highly jointed rock, tend to slump and erode too quickly to form stacks, while harder rocks such as granite erode in different ways.)

The formation process usually begins when the sea attacks lines of weakness, such as steep joints or small fault zones in a cliff face. These cracks then gradually get larger and turn into caves. If a cave wears through a headland, an arch forms. Further erosion causes the arch to collapse, leaving the pillar of hard rock standing away from the coast, the stack. Eventually, erosion will cause the stack to collapse, leaving a stump. This stump usually forms a small rock island, low enough for a high tide to submerge.

<text>The IBM Portable Personal Computer 5155 model 68 is an early portable computer developed by IBM after the success of the suitcase-size Compaq Portable. It was released in February 1984 and was quickly replaced by the IBM Convertible, only roughly two years after its debut.

==Design==
The Portable was basically a PC/XT motherboard, transplanted into a Compaq-style luggable case. The system featured 256 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 640 KB), an added CGA card connected to an internal monochrome amber composite monitor, and one or two half-height -inch 360 KB floppy disk drives, manufactured by Qume. Unlike the Compaq Portable, which used a dual-mode monitor and special display card, IBM used a stock CGA card and a 9-inch amber monochrome composite monitor, which had lower resolution. It could, however, display color if connected to an external monitor or television. A separate 83-key keyboard and cable was provided, which uses a front panel mounted phone jack styled connector RJ11. The cable from the connector then went to the back of the machine, where the original XT keyboard jack was.

Experts stated that IBM developed the Portable in part because its sales force needed a computer that would compete against the Compaq Portable. If less sophisticated than the Compaq, the IBM had the advantage of a lower price tag. The motherboard had eight expansion slots. The power supply was rated 114 watts and was suitable for operation on either 115 or 230 VAC. Hard disks were a very common third-party add-on as IBM did not offer them from the factory. Typically in a two-drive context, floppy drive A: ran the operating system, and drive B: would be used for application and data diskettes. 

Its selling point as a &quot;portable&quot; was that it combined the monitor into a base unit approximating a medium-sized suitcase that could be simply set on its flat side, the back panel slid away to reveal the power connector, plugged in, the keyboard folded down or detached, and booted up for use, though printers at the time, if needed, still tended to be less &quot;portable&quot;. At thirty pounds, it may have been difficult to carry for some, and was often referred to as &quot;luggable&quot;.

<text>Ben Clifford Curtis (born May 26, 1977) is an American professional golfer and four-time winner on the PGA Tour, best known for winning the 2003 Open Championship.

In January 2018, Curtis told &quot;Golf Digest&quot; that he has stopped playing golf competitively, opting to teach instead.

==Early career==
Curtis was born in Columbus, Ohio and grew up in Ostrander. His family runs the Mill Creek Golf Club, also in Ostrander. Curtis is a graduate of Buckeye Valley High School and Kent State University, where he was a star on the golf team and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in recreation management in 2000.

As an amateur, Curtis found much success, winning the Ohio Amateur in 1999 and 2000 (joining professional golfers John Cook, Arnold Palmer and Frank Stranahan as the only men to win the Ohio Amateur in consecutive years), and also the Players Amateur in 2000.

==Professional career==
Curtis turned professional in 2000, originally playing on the Hooters Tour without much success. At the end of 2002, he finished in a tie for 26th at that year&#x27;s Q-School, earning his PGA Tour card for the following year, becoming one of the few players to completely skip the Nationwide Tour. His first year on tour began unspectacularly as he made a fair amount of cuts, but had no finishes in the top 25, until a tie for 13th at the Western Open on July 6, which qualified him for The Open Championship in England less than two weeks later.

===2003 Open Championship win===
Curtis entered the 2003 Open Championship at Royal St George&#x27;s as a 300–1 outsider, defying the odds to win the tournament.

After an opening round 72 (+1), he shot a second round 72 to pull into a seven-way tie for fourth. A third round 70 put Curtis in a five-way tie for third, two strokes behind leader Thomas Bjørn and one stroke behind second-place Davis Love III. While Bjørn shot a final round 72, Curtis fired a 69 to finish at −1, one stroke ahead of Bjørn and Vijay Singh.

The 2003 Open Championship was Curtis&#x27; first appearance in a major. He became the first golfer since Francis Ouimet in the 1913 U.S. Open to win his major championship debut, later accomplished by Keegan Bradley in the 2011 PGA Championship. After his victory, Curtis jumped from 396th in the world rankings to 35th. This victory and a solid first season on the PGA Tour led to Curtis being named the 2003 PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. Curtis was the lowest-ranked player to win a major since official world rankings were first calculated.

===Further success===
2004–07

Curtis&#x27; Open Championship victory gave him a five-year exemption on the PGA Tour and a 10-year exemption on the European Tour, and he played events on both tours in 2004. However, he did not experience immediate success, missing many cuts and only recording one top-10 finish on the PGA Tour. He missed even more cuts in 2005 and only had two top-10 finishes.

In 2006, his results improved as he made the cut much more consistently and recorded two wins, the Booz Allen Classic and the 84 Lumber Classic. His consistent form continued into 2007 and he tied for 8th place at that year&#x27;s Open Championship in Carnoustie, his best result in a major since winning the tournament.

2008–09

Curtis recorded five top-10 finishes and missed only four cuts. He bettered his Open Championship result from the previous year by finishing in a tie for 7th at Royal Birkdale and followed it up a month later by finishing tied for 2nd place in the PGA Championship at Oakland Hills. This second-place finish qualified him for the 2008 Ryder Cup, his first appearance in the event.

For 2009, Curtis missed only three cuts in 18 PGA Tour events. However, Curtis managed only one top-20 finish and ended the year outside the top 100 in the money list. He did achieve two top-10 finishes on the European Tour. At the 2009 Open Championship at Turnberry, Curtis shot a 65 to tie for second after the first round, but a second round 80 meant that he missed the cut by one shot.

2010–12

In 2010, Curtis missed only eight cuts in 24 events, but achieved only one top-10 finish and he ended outside the top 100 on the money list for a second consecutive year. A rough 2011 season saw Curtis finish 149th on the PGA Tour money list after making 10 cuts in 23 events, leaving him partially exempt for the 2012 PGA Tour season. For the start of the 2012 season, he split his time between the European Tour and PGA Tour, taking advantage of his European Tour exemption and attempting to qualify for the Race to Dubai.

In April 2012, Curtis won the Valero Texas Open for his fourth PGA Tour victory, ending a six-year winless drought. Curtis held a one-shot lead entering the 71st hole and made a 22-foot putt for par to maintain his lead. He went on to birdie the last hole, sinking a 12-foot birdie putt for a two-stroke victory over Matt Every and John Huh. With the win, Curtis regained full exemption status on the PGA Tour through 2014. Curtis jumped from 200th to 28th in the FedEx Cup standings and moved up over 100 places in the world rankings to 156th.

Curtis followed up his win at the Valero Texas Open with three straight top-15 finishes (tied for 13th at the Zurich Classic, tied for 5th at the Wells Fargo Classic, and tied for 2nd at The Players Championship). This moved him into the top 75 of the Official World Golf Ranking. His career high ranking is 24th. He also finished tied for 11th in the PGA Championship, his best finish in a major championship in four years.

2013–16

In 2013 Curtis played in 20 PGA Tour events, making the cut in 10 with three top-25 finishes. His 2014 season netted him one top 10 and ten missed cuts in 24 starts to finish 131st in the FedEx Cup, leaving him partially exempt for the 2015 season. In 2015 Curtis played a partial schedule on the PGA Tour with little success. He played 14 events and only made the cut three times, with his best finish a tie for 29th at the Sanderson Farms Championship. With a finish well outside 150th, Curtis played the 2015–16 season with only past champion status. He only played five events during the 2016 season, missing the cut in all but one tournament.

==Personal life==
Curtis, his wife Candace, and their two children reside in Franklin Township, just north of Kent, Ohio after previously living in neighboring Stow. In 2013, Ben and Candace started the Ben Curtis Family Foundation to benefit needy children in the Kent area. Currently coaching his son as the Head Golf Coach at Kent Roosevelt High School

<doc id="274018" wikidata="Q13750" url="?curid=274018" title="Benguet">
<text>Benguet (), officially the Province of Benguet (&quot;;&quot; ; ; ; ), is a landlocked province of the Philippines located in the southern tip of the Cordillera Administrative Region in the island of Luzon. Its capital is La Trinidad.

The highland province is known as the &quot;Salad Bowl of the Philippines&quot; due to its huge production of upland vegetables.

Situated within the interior of Benguet is the highly urbanized city of Baguio, which is administered independent from the province and also its largest city.

==History==
===Early history===
The mountainous area now covered by Benguet is generally presumed to have been settled from at least the 14th century by tribes coming from the surrounding lowlands, lured by the abundance of natural resources such as gold, hides, and wax. Two of these groups, the Ibaloi and the Kankanaey, are dominant ethnolinguistic groups of the area. In the pre-conquest period, these tribes enjoyed flourishing trade with lowland groups immediately to their west and south, such as the Pangasinans. Governor Juan &quot;Oraa&quot; Cariño (1913-1918), one of Benguet’s governors, was the first Filipino governor.

The Kankanaey occupied the northern highlands of the province, while the Ibaloy occupied the southern portion, while all Igorots practiced animism and ancestor worship. Rituals were proscribed by the priests, &quot;mambunong&quot;. The economy of the region was based on rice terraces, root crop swidden farming, livestock raising, hunting, foraging, plus the mining and trading of gold. These Igorot gold mines were located in Suyoc, Tabio, Acupan, and Antamok. Gold panning took place in placer deposits along the Agno River, the Bued River, the Suyoc River, and the Amburayan River. Gold was also mined from lode veins within andesite and diorite. Gold in Mankayan was associated with copper. Gold mining resulted in social stratification, with the upper class consisting of the mine owners, the &quot;baknang&quot;, followed by the gold workers, or &quot;abiteg&quot;, and then the &quot;bagaen&quot;, or slave class. These slaves were made up of war captives, and their children. Gold mines were inheritable kinship property, while original ownership was bestowed on those individuals discovering the gold location, and then developing the property.

===Spanish colonial era===
At the beginning of the Spanish Era, colonisers heard of the rich gold mines in the mountains and attempted to colonize the highlands, but failed. In 1572, Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; Juan de Salcedo led a small expedition into the southern part of Benguet, but the natives forced it to retreat. The first major expedition into the mountains occurred in 1620, when Spanish explorers went into the La Trinidad Valley, followed by a second expedition in 1623, and a third in 1624. This was the last attempt to occupy the Baguio gold mines by the Spanish until the Galvey expeditions (1829-1839).

In the 1800s, Spanish colonizers made more serious attempts such as expeditions under Col. Guillermo Galvey and succeeded in establishing a presence in the La Trinidad Valley, named after Galvey&#x27;s wife.

This area later became a district of the new province of &quot;LaMontañosa&quot; (or &quot;LaMontaña&quot;) in 1846. Eight years later, in 1854, Benguet became a separate &quot;comandancia politico-militar&quot;. Parts of the present province were established as component territories of other &quot;comandancias&quot; such as Lepanto and Amburayan.

===American colonial era===
When the Americans took control of the Philippines, they established local civil governments in many parts of the country. American civilian government was established in Benguet on November 23, 1900, through &quot;Act No. 48&quot;, with Canadian journalist &quot;H.P. Whitmarsh&quot; appointed as the province&#x27;s first governor.

Upon the American colonial government enacting &quot;Act No. 1876&quot; on August 18, 1908, which created Mountain Province from areas of the old &quot;La Montañosa&quot;, Benguet (along with Amburayan, Apayao, Bontoc, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Lepanto) became sub-provinces of this new province. A year later in 1909, the township of Baguio was abolished upon its conversion into a chartered city. In 1920, portions of the sub-provinces of Amburayan and Lepanto were incorporated into Benguet.

Mining companies started operating in the province in the 1930s. This brought jobs, and many lowlanders migrated to Benguet, especially in towns surrounding the gold mines, such as Itogon, Mankayan and Tuba.

===Japanese occupation era===

During World War II, Igorot guerrillas and the combined Filipino and American forces fought Japanese soldiers during the final days of the war in 1945.

As part of the Japanese defence of the Philippines, General Yamashita situated his military headquarters in Baguio, from where he organised the Japanese resistance on Lúzon from December 1944 to April 1945, before he relocated to the village of Bambang.

=== Contemporary history ===
On June 18, 1966, the huge Mountain Province was split into four provinces with the enactment of &quot;Republic Act No. 4695&quot;. The four provinces were Benguet, Mountain Province, Kalinga-Apayao and Ifugao.

On June 22, 1973, as part of the &quot;Integrated Organization Plan&quot; of President Ferdinand Marcos, Benguet was placed under the jurisdiction of the Ilocos Region.

When the Cordillera Administrative Region was established by President Corazon Aquino through &quot;Executive Order 220&quot; on July 15, 1987, Benguet was made one of its provinces.

==Geology==

The Baguio Mining District consists of Late Cretaceous ophiolite basement rocks. These are overlain by Eocene back arc tholeiitic Pugo Metavolcanics. These grade into the Dalupirip Schist, which is separated from the Early Oligocene-Early Miocene sedimentary Zigzag Formation by an unconformity. The Zigzag is composed of deep depositional environment interbedded green sandstones, red siltstones, oligomicitc conglomerates, and minor limestone units. The late Early Miocene-early Middle Miocene reefal Kennon Limestone overlays the Zigzag. The Late Oligocene-Early Miocene Agno Batholith intrudes the Pugo and Zigzag. The Middle-Late Miocene Klondyke Formation was deposited during Central Cordillera geologic uplift, consisting of coarse clastics, polymictic conglomerates, sandstones, and vitric (glassy) tuffs, with minor shales and siltstones. Gold mineralization occurred with dioritic and gabbroic intrusions, and basaltic to andesitic lavas, including the Monglo adakite. The Pliocene Baguio Formation consists of conglomerates interbedded with lava flows and pyroclastics. Pleistocene gold-copper mineralization occurred with calc-alkaline and dioritic and dacitic adakitic intrusions. This mineralization characterizes the Philex Mine.

The main gold base metal mineralization zone is approximately 8 km wide, trends north south for tens of kilometers, and is centrally located at 16° 20&#x27; to 16° 26&#x27; N latitude and 120° 37&#x27; 30&quot; to 120° 43&#x27; 30&quot; E longitude. The western boundary of this zone is defined by a volcanic belt, just west of Baguio, while the eastern boundary is defined by an intrusive belt, just east of the Itogon and Antamok mines. The Agno quartz diorite batholith is further east near Binga Dam. Key mines, starting from the south, include the Philex (Cu), Acupan (Au), Itogon (Au), Black Mt. (Cu), Benguet Exploration (Cu), Atok (Au), Antamok (Cu and Au), and Baguio Gold (Au), where Baguio Gold and Antamok are east of Baguio. Continuing northwards, key mines include the King Solomon (Cu), St. Nino (Cu), Boneng (Cu), Lobo (Cu), Gambang (Cu and Au), and Lepanto (Cu and Au). 
By 1979, underground mining had reached Level 1850 in the Antamok Mine.

==Geography==
Benguet covers an area of occupying the southwestern tip of the Cordillera Administrative Region. If Baguio is included for geographical purposes, the total area of Benguet is .

The province is bordered on the northeast by Mountain Province and Ifugao, on the southeast by Nueva Vizcaya, on the south by Pangasinan, on the west by La Union, and on the northwest by Ilocos Sur.

Situated within the Cordillera mountains, Benguet is dominantly mountainous. Mount Pulag, the highest in Luzon is located within Kabayan. The mountains form the headwaters of several rivers, the major ones which include the Agno, Amburayan, Bued, Bakun, Balili and the Asin. Some of these run through river valleys or gorges.

Several natural lakes, small in size, are found within the hinterlands. The largest are the &quot;Four Lakes&quot; in Kabayan; Lake Bulalacao, Lake Detepngepos, Lake Incolos and Lake Tabeyo.

The province is the location of several conservation areas, the largest of which are the Upper Agno River Basin Resource Reserve, Mount Pulag National Park, Mount Data National Park and Lower Agno Watershed Forest Reserve.

===Climate===
Most of Benguet falls under the subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;) zone, experiencing annual average highs of in April and lows of in January.

The province suffers from crop damage resulting from seasonal frost during the cold months of December to March, especially in high-altitude towns such as Atok, Buguias, Mankayan and Kibungan. In February 2007, Benguet suffered crop damage due to temperatures reaching as low as .
===Administrative divisions===
Benguet comprises 13 municipalities, all encompassed by double legislative districts.

The highly urbanized city of Baguio, although administratively independent from Benguet, is situated in the interior of the province, surrounded by the municipalities of La Trinidad, Itogon, Sablan and Tuba. The city used to be part of the province but became independent when the city&#x27;s charter was enacted in 1909.



===Barangays===
The 13 municipalities of the province comprise a total of 140 barangays, with &quot;Pico&quot; in La Trinidad as the most populous in 2010, and &quot;Anchokey&quot; in Kabayan as the least.
==Demographics==
The population of Benguet in the 2020 census was 460,683 people, making it the most populous province in the region. It had a density of . If the highly urbanized city of Baguio is included for geographical purposes, the population is 791,590, with a density of .

In the May 2000 census, Benguet had a total population of 330,129. This figure is up by 16,296 from 313,833 persons recorded in the 1995 census, giving an annual growth rate of 1.09% during the 5-year period compared to the national average of 2.43%. The province registered 63,123 households, an increase of 4,588 households over the 1990 figure. This gave an average household size of 5.20 persons, slightly higher than the national average of 4.99.


===Ethnicity===
The people of Benguet comprise three main ethnolinguistic groups. Kankanaeys dominate the northwestern municipalities, Ibalois are concentrated on the southeast, and Kalanguyas are mostly found in the east. Migrants from lowland provinces have fused with the local populace to form a melting pot in some areas.

According to the 2000 Philippine census, Kankanaeys comprised of the entire provincial household population of 329,216 at the time, while were identified as Ibalois, and were Ikalahan/Kalanguya. Major resident lowland ethnic groups included Ilocanos at and Tagalogs at . Ilokano population particularly doctors, teachers, businessmen and public servants arrived during the American period for the improvement of the health condition and for the education of the people. The pioneer Ilocanos helped establish La Trinidad as a commercial and political center.This resulted in an improved healthcare, education and economic life of the people&#x27; lives. It also established a closer ties between the Ilocanos and the Cordillerans.
===Languages===
Benguet residents generally speak their own languages in addition to Ilocano, Tagalog, and English, which are used for trade and commerce. The Ibaloi tribe speak Ibaloi, which is similar to Pangasinan, while the Kankanaey have their own eponymous language, which is related to the Bontoc language.

The SIL Ethnologue database classifies the languages under the &quot;South-Central Cordilleran&quot; branch. Nabaloy (named in the database as &quot;Ibaloi&quot;) is part of the &quot;Southern Cordilleran&quot; branch which also includes Pangasinense. The Kankanaey language is under the &quot;Central Cordilleran&quot; branch, which also includes Bontoc and Ifugao.

===Religion===

Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion with 59% adherence, Other groups such as Members Church of God International (MCG), Protestants, especially Anglicans, Methodists, Baptists, and Evangelicals, form about 33% of the population, while the Iglesia ni Cristo forms about 7%. There is also small community of Muslims (0.472% of the province population).

==Economy==

Agriculture, mining, and tourism are the major industries in Benguet. Its cool climate and high altitude has made it an ideal place for producing highland vegetables. Benguet is often called the &quot;Salad Bowl of the Philippines&quot;. The La Trinidad Vegetable Trading Post in the capital town of La Trinidad serves as the hub of vegetable trading in the province, attracting farmers, merchants and traders from the local community and the Philippines&#x27; different provinces. Major crops produced which include potatoes, Baguio beans, peas, strawberries, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce, sayote and carrots are shipped throughout the country.

Horticulture and floriculture are practiced in the province. The province supplies flowers to the different municipalities, including Baguio, as well as to Metro Manila, including other parts of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Roses are produced, particularly in Barangay Bahong in La Trinidad, earning the barangay the title &quot;Rose Capital of the Philippines&quot;. Apisang (scientific name: &quot;Pittosporum resiniferum&quot;), a plant endemic to the Philippines (as well as Malaysia), is grown in the municipalities of Kapangan and Kibungan as a potential alternative source of fuel and energy, rivaling the jatropha biofuel plant.

Other agricultural-related activities are monggo processing, fruit preservation, peanut brittle manufacturing, broom making and basket weaving.

Mining is a major industry in Benguet, which is one of the country&#x27;s leading gold producers. The Benguet Corporation, the first and oldest mining company in the Philippines, has extracted gold, copper and chromite in Itogon since 1903.

Other mineral deposits are silver, copper, pyrite, and limestone. Silver smithing is a large industry in Benguet, and many entrepreneurs sell silver works at lower prices in Baguio compared to Manila. In 2006, revenues from mining reached 4 billion pesos from just two (Lepanto Consolidated Mining Corporation and Philex Mines) of many mining firms operating in the province. The province&#x27;s mining vigor has never translated into better quality of life of the Benguet people, simply because a bulk of the mining firm&#x27;s taxes are not paid directly to the province. The two mining corporations, like many others around the country, have principal offices in the City of Makati, a set-up that makes Makati the prime mining tax beneficiary.

The location of Baguio within Benguet draws many tourists from the lowlands. Often, people who go to Baguio also explore the province, especially the strawberry fields in La Trinidad.
==Education==
Higher education in the province is centered in the capital town of La Trinidad, which houses the &quot;Main Campus&quot; of the only university in Benguet, the Benguet State University (BSU). The university has two satellite campuses in two municipalities; the &quot;Buguias Campus&quot; at Loo, Buguias, and the &quot;Bokod Campus&quot; at Ambangeg, Bokod.

Other educational institutions which include Advocates Academic College, BVS Colleges, Cordillera Career Development College, King&#x27;s College of the Philippines, Philippine College of Ministry, Philippine Nazarene College, as well as the Cordillera Regional Science High School, the Benguet National High School (with several annexes) and the Benguet SPED Center are also situated within La Trinidad.

The independent chartered city of Baguio hosts several higher education institutions, which include most notably the University of the Philippines Baguio, Saint Louis University, University of the Cordilleras (formerly &quot;Baguio Colleges Foundation&quot;), University of Baguio, Pines City Colleges, Baguio Central University, and Baguio School of Business and Technology, attracting students from across the Philippines.

==Tourism==
The province is a major tourist destination in the country, with most of its tourist spots centered on culture and nature. Baguio&#x27;s location within the province provides a boost to the tourism industry of the province. Notable interesting places in the province include Mount Pulag along Kabayan, Kennon Road in Tuba, Ambuklao Dam in Bokod, Binga Dam in Itogon, strawberry and flower farms in La Trinidad, and the Palina and Naguey rice terraces in Atok.

Tuba and Tublay hot springs are usually flocked by local tourists from the neighboring provinces. Vegetable terraces can be seen along the Halsema Highway, especially during the growing season. Kabayan is known for its centuries-old mummies, while Buguias is visited for its hot springs and the Apo Anno.

<doc id="274024" wikidata="Q1941908" url="?curid=274024" title="The Land of Rape and Honey">
<text>The Land of Rape and Honey is the third studio album by American industrial metal band Ministry, released on October 11, 1988, by Sire Records. This is the first Ministry album to include bassist Paul Barker and marks a departure from the band&#x27;s previous two synthpop and EBM records. It incorporates heavy metal guitars and industrial music influences, and Al Jourgensen uses distorted vocals in his natural accent, rather than the faux British accent of previous albums. The resulting sound was influential in the industrial metal genre and is Jourgensen&#x27;s favorite Ministry album. The album was certified gold by the RIAA in January 1996.

The album title comes from the slogan of Tisdale, Saskatchewan, whose motto at that time was &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot;, a reference to the agricultural products rapeseed and honey. The band chose the name after seeing the slogan on a souvenir mug.

== Background ==
Jourgensen credited his work with Adrian Sherwood on the preceding album, &quot;Twitch&quot;, for giving him confidence in his vision and showing him new techniques, which he said he pushed to an extreme. Jourgensen had experimented with a heavier, industrial sound starting in the mid-1980s with singles such as &quot;No Devotion&quot; from the Revolting Cocks&#x27; &quot;Big Sexy Land&quot; and &quot;All Day&quot; from &quot;Twitch&quot;. When RevCo&#x27;s next single was more commercial, Sire proposed doing the same for the new Ministry album, but Jourgensen threatened to disband Ministry.
Continuing in this less-commercial, industrial-laced direction, &quot;Land of Rape and Honey&quot; incorporates elements of heavy metal such as fast electric guitar riffs, although only the album&#x27;s first three songs use guitars extensively. &quot;Stigmata&quot; does not feature live guitars; the two chord riff, altered with a pitch shifter, was sampled. Jourgensen had written some of the songs prior to working on &quot;Twitch&quot; and said this was the sound he originally wanted for the band.

In his memoirs, Jourgensen described himself at the time as a &quot;functional addict&quot; who scheduled his life around his dealer&#x27;s availability. Despite this, he spent hours editing tapes of music the band had recorded; Jourgensen described them as &quot;snippets of noise&quot; that came to him in dreams. Inspired by William Burroughs and the cut-up technique, Jourgensen cut up the tapes and spliced them back together randomly until he liked the end result. Jourgensen wrote &quot;Stigmata&quot; at the last minute after realizing he needed another song to complete the album.

A post made on Wax Trax! Records&#x27; official Instagram account in 2019 shows a handwritten production sheet featuring a number of tracks which did not appear on the final record. Certain songs were instead released through the bands&#x27; side projects: &quot;Idiot&quot; and &quot;Blackened Heart&quot; under Lead Into Gold and &quot;Apathy&quot; for 1000 Homo DJs.

==Artwork==
The album cover is an electronically processed image of a burned corpse in the Leipzig-Thekla subcamp of Buchenwald. Jourgensen took a photograph while watching a Holocaust documentary on television and distorted the image himself. According to Jourgensen, it was originally rejected by the record label, but they later changed their mind after Jourgensen cut off the head of a roadkilled deer, put it in his truck, drove from Austin to Los Angeles, went into the Sire Records building, threw the head on the desk of the head of the art department and said, &quot;Here&#x27;s your new fucking [album] cover.&quot;

Additional inner sleeve photography features a 1945 archival film footage of corpses of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp lying in a hillside mass grave in Nordhausen, Germany.

==Legacy==
The album was certified gold by the RIAA in January 1996 and was re-issued by Wounded Bird Records in 2007.

Tom Moon wrote in &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot; that the album &quot;became the blueprint for all of what was tagged as &#x27;industrial&#x27; dance music&quot;. Fear Factory, Linkin Park, Slipknot and Nine Inch Nails have cited this album as a major influence. Jason Heller of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said the album &quot;straddles a huge shift in industrial&quot; and includes influences from most industrial music offshoots at the time. Heller suggested it to pop culture enthusiasts who want an accessible entry-point for industrial music. Jourgensen has cited &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot; as his favorite Ministry album, likening it to a learning experience that changes one&#x27;s life. However, Jourgensen said that &quot;Stigmata&quot; is his least favorite song in the Ministry catalogue for its simplistic songwriting despite its popularity. The track is featured in Richard Stanley&#x27;s 1990 science fiction thriller &quot;Hardware&quot;, although the band shown performing the track is Gwar. Marilyn Manson performed a cover on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Atomic Blonde&quot;.

===Samples===
#&lt;li value=4&gt;&quot;Golden Dawn&quot;
#*&quot;You are being found guilty of covenants with the devil,&quot; &quot;State your confession,&quot; &quot;Confess! Confess!&quot; &quot;The Anti-Christ&quot; - &quot;The Devils&quot;
#*[chanting] - Aleister Crowley, from his &quot;Call of the First Aethyr&quot;

#&lt;li value=7&gt;&quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot;
#*&quot;Sieg...&quot; &quot;...Heil!&quot; [chanting] - &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;. These chants are used ironically in the song, which is anti-fascist, and the band gave context to the Nazi chants by ranting about political issues during concerts. This was still misinterpreted by white power skinheads as the band&#x27;s support for Nazism. Jourgensen said the band jumped into the crowd and fought the skinheads, but rumors persisted that the band was fascist.

<text>The Gaussian gravitational constant (symbol ) is a parameter used in the orbital mechanics of the Solar System.
It relates the orbital period to the orbit&#x27;s semi-major axis and the mass of the orbiting body in Solar masses.

The value of historically expresses the mean angular velocity of the system of Earth+Moon and the Sun considered as a two body problem,
with a value of about 0.986 degrees per day, or about 0.0172 radians per day. As a consequence of the law of gravitation and Kepler&#x27;s third law, 
 is directly proportional to the square root of the standard gravitational parameter of the Sun, and its value in radians per day follows by setting Earth&#x27;s semi-major axis (the astronomical unit, au) to unity, :(rad/d) ()0.5·au−1.5.

A value of rad/day was determined by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his 1809 work &quot;Theoria Motus Corporum Coelestium in Sectionibus Conicis Solem Ambientum&quot; (&quot;Theory of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies Moving about the Sun in Conic Sections&quot;).
Gauss&#x27;s value was introduced as a fixed, defined value by the IAU (adopted in 1938, formally defined in 1964), which detached it from its immediate representation of the (observable) mean angular velocity of the Sun–Earth system. Instead, the astronomical unit now became a measurable quantity slightly different from unity. This was useful in 20th-century celestial mechanics to prevent the constant adaptation of orbital parameters to updated measured values, but it came at the expense of intuitiveness, as the astronomical unit, ostensibly a unit of length, was now dependent on the measurement of the strength of the gravitational force.

The IAU abandoned the defined value of in 2012 in favour of a defined value of the astronomical unit of exactly, while the strength of the gravitational force is now to be expressed in the separate standard gravitational parameter , measured in SI units of m3⋅s−2.

==Discussion==
Gauss&#x27;s constant is derived from the application of Kepler&#x27;s third law to the 
system of Earth+Moon and the Sun considered as a two-body problem,
relating the period of revolution () to the major semi-axis of the orbit () and the total mass of the orbiting bodies ().
Its numerical value was obtained by setting the major semi-axis and the mass of the Sun to unity and measuring the period in mean solar days:
: 2 / ( ) ≈ 0.0172021 [rad], where:
: ≈ 365.256 [days], = (++) ≈ 1.00000304 [], and = 1 by definition.

The value represents the mean angular motion of the Earth-Sun system, in radians per day, equivalent to a value just below one degree (the division of the circle into 360 degrees in Babylonian astronomy was likely intended as approximating the number of days in a solar year). 
The correction due to the division by the square root of reflects the fact that the Earth–Moon system is not orbiting the Sun itself, but the center of mass of the system.

Isaac Newton himself determined a value of this constant which agreed with Gauss&#x27;s value to six significant digits.
Gauss (1809) gave the value with nine significant digits, as 3548.18761 arc seconds.

Since all involved parameters, the orbital period, the Earth-to-Sun mass ratio, the semi-major axis and the length of the mean solar day, are subject to increasingly refined measurement, the precise value of the constant would have to be revised over time. 
But since the constant is involved in determining the orbital parameters of all other bodies in the Solar System, it was found to be more convenient to set it to a fixed value, by definition, implying that the value of would deviate from unity.
The fixed value of 0.01720209895 [rad] was taken to be the one set by Gauss (converted from degrees to radian), so that 
 42:(2 2 ) ≈ 1.

Gauss&#x27;s 1809 value of the constant was thus used as an authoritative reference value for the orbital mechanics of the Solar System for two centuries.
From its introduction until 1938 it was considered a measured quantity, and from 1938 until 2012 it was used as a defined quantity, with measurement uncertainty delegated to the value of the astronomical unit. 
The defined value of was abandoned by the IAU in 2012, and the use of was deprecated, to be replaced by a fixed value of the astronomical unit, and the (measured) quantity of the standard gravitational parameter .

===Role as a defining constant of Solar System dynamics===

Gauss himself stated the constant in arc seconds, with nine significant digits, as .
In the late 19th century, this value was adopted, and converted to radian, by Simon Newcomb, as . 
and the constant appears in this form in his &quot;Tables of the Sun&quot;, published in 1898.

Newcomb&#x27;s work was widely accepted as the best then available and his values of the constants were incorporated into a great quantity of astronomical research. Because of this, it became difficult to separate the constants from the research; new values of the constants would, at least partially, invalidate a large body of work. Hence, after the formation of the International Astronomical Union in 1919 certain constants came to be gradually accepted as &quot;fundamental&quot;: defining constants from which all others were derived. In 1938, the VIth General Assembly of the IAU declared,

However, no further effort toward establishing a set of constants was forthcoming until 1950. An IAU symposium on the system of constants was held in Paris in 1963, partially in response to recent developments in space exploration. The attendees finally decided at that time to establish a consistent set of constants. Resolution 1 stated that

Resolution 4 recommended

Included in the list of fundamental constants was

These resolutions were taken up by a working group of the IAU, who in their report recommended two defining constants, one of which was

For the first time, the Gaussian constant&#x27;s role in the scale of the Solar System was officially recognized. The working group&#x27;s recommendations were accepted at the XIIth General Assembly of the IAU at Hamburg, Germany in 1964.

====Definition of the astronomical unit====
Gauss intended his constant to be defined using a mean distance of Earth from the Sun of 1 astronomical unit precisely. With the acceptance of the 1964 resolutions, the IAU, in effect, did the opposite: defined the constant as fundamental, and the astronomical unit as derived, the other variables in the definition being already fixed: mass (of the Sun), and time (the day of seconds). This transferred the uncertainty from the gravitational constant to uncertainty in the semi-major axis of the Earth-Sun system, which was no longer exactly one au (the au being defined as depending on the value of the gravitational constant).
The astronomical unit thus became a measured quantity rather than a defined, fixed one.

In 1976, the IAU reconfirmed the Gaussian constant&#x27;s status at the XVIth General Assembly in Grenoble, declaring it to be a defining constant, and that

From this definition, the mean distance of Earth from the Sun works out to 1.000 000 03 au, but with perturbations by the other planets, which do not average to zero over time, the average distance is 1.000 000 20 au.

====Abandonment====
In 2012, the IAU, as part of a new, self-consistent set of units and numerical standards for use in modern dynamical astronomy, redefined the astronomical unit as 
and hence abandoned the Gaussian constant as an indirect definition of scale in the Solar System, recommending

The value of &quot;k&quot; based on the defined value for the astronomical unit would now be subject to the measurement uncertainty of the standard gravitational parameter,
formula_1

===Units and dimensions===
 is given as a unit-less fraction of the order of 1.7%, but it can be considered equivalent to the square root of the gravitational constant, in which case it has the units of au⋅d−1⋅−, where
:au is the distance for which takes its value as defined by Gauss—the distance of the unperturbed circular orbit of a hypothetical, massless body whose orbital period is days,
:d is the mean solar day (86,400 seconds),
: is the mass of the Sun.
Therefore, the dimensions of are
:length time−1 mass− or .

In spite of this is known to much greater accuracy than (or the square root of ).
The absolute value of is known to an accuracy of about 10−4, but the product (the gravitational parameter of the Sun) is known to an accuracy better than 10−10.

== Derivation ==

===Gauss&#x27;s original===
Gauss begins his &quot;Theoria Motus&quot; by presenting without proof several laws concerning the motion of bodies about the Sun. Later in the text, he mentions that Pierre-Simon Laplace treats these in detail in his &quot;Mécanique Céleste&quot;. Gauss&#x27;s final two laws are as follows:
* The area swept by a line joining a body and the Sun divided by the time in which it is swept gives a constant quotient. This is Kepler&#x27;s second law of planetary motion.
* The square of this quotient is proportional to the parameter (that is, the latus rectum) of the orbit and the sum of the mass of the Sun and the body. This is a modified form of Kepler&#x27;s third law.

He next defines:

* as the parameter (i.e., the latus rectum) of a body&#x27;s orbit,
* as the mass of the body, where the mass of the Sun = 1,
* as the area swept out by a line joining the Sun and the body,
* as the time in which this area is swept,

and declares that 
:formula_2
is &quot;constant for all heavenly bodies&quot;. He continues, &quot;it is of no importance which body we use for determining this number,&quot; and hence uses Earth, defining
*unit distance = Earth&#x27;s mean distance (that is, its semi-major axis) from the Sun,
*unit time = one solar day.
He states that the area swept out by Earth in its orbit &quot;will evidently be&quot; , and uses this to simplify his constant to
:formula_3
Here, he names the constant and plugging in some measured values, = days, = solar masses, achieves the result = .

===In modern terms===
Gauss is notorious for leaving out details, and this derivation is no exception. It is here repeated in modern terms, filling out some of the details.

Define without proof

:formula_4

where

* is the time rate of sweep of area by a body in its orbit, a constant according to Kepler&#x27;s second law, and
* is the specific angular momentum, one of the constants of two-body motion.

Next define

:formula_5

where
*, a gravitational parameter, where
** is Newton&#x27;s gravitational constant,
** is the mass of the primary body (i.e., the Sun),
** is the mass of the secondary body (i.e., a planet), and
* is the semi-parameter (the semi-latus rectum) of the body&#x27;s orbit.
Note that every variable in the above equations is a constant for two-body motion. Combining these two definitions,

:formula_6

which is what Gauss was describing with the last of his laws. Taking the square root,

:formula_7

and solving for ,

:formula_8

At this point, define . Let be the entire area swept out by the body as it orbits, hence , the area of an ellipse, where is the semi-major axis and is the semi-minor axis. Let , the time for the body to complete one orbit. Thus,

:formula_9

Here, Gauss decides to use Earth to solve for . From the geometry of an ellipse, .   By setting Earth&#x27;s semi-major axis, , reduces to and . Substituting, the area of the ellipse &quot;is evidently&quot; , rather than . Putting this into the numerator of the equation for and reducing,

:formula_10

Note that Gauss, by normalizing the size of the orbit, has eliminated it completely from the equation. Normalizing further, set the mass of the Sun to 1,

:formula_11

where now is in solar masses. What is left are two quantities: , the period of Earth&#x27;s orbit or the sidereal year, a quantity known precisely by measurement over centuries, and , the mass of the Earth–Moon system. 
Again plugging in the measured values as they were known in Gauss&#x27;s time, = days, = solar masses, yielding the result = .

===Gauss&#x27;s constant and Kepler&#x27;s third law===
The Gaussian constant is closely related to Kepler&#x27;s third law of planetary motion, and one is easily derived from the other. Beginning with the full definition of Gauss&#x27;s constant,

:formula_12

where
* is the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit,
* is the semi-minor axis of the elliptical orbit,
* is the orbital period,
* is the mass of the primary body,
* is the mass of the secondary body, and
* is the semi-latus rectum of the elliptical orbit.

From the geometry of an ellipse, the semi-latus rectum, can be expressed in terms of and thus: .   Therefore,

:formula_13

Substituting and reducing, Gauss&#x27;s constant becomes

:formula_14

From orbital mechanics, is just , the mean motion of the body in its orbit. Hence,

:formula_15

which is the definition of Kepler&#x27;s third law. In this form, it is often seen with , the Newtonian gravitational constant in place of .

Setting , , , and in radians per day results in , also in units of radians per day, about which see the relevant section of the mean motion article.

==Other definitions==

The value of Gauss&#x27;s constant, exactly as he derived it, had been used since Gauss&#x27;s time because it was held to be a fundamental constant, as described above. The solar mass, mean solar day and sidereal year with which Gauss defined his constant are all slowly changing in value. If modern values were inserted into the defining equation, a value of would result. 

It is also possible to set the gravitational constant, the mass of the Sun, and the astronomical unit to 1. This defines a unit of time with which the period of the resulting orbit is equal to . These are often called &quot;canonical units&quot;.

<doc id="274029" wikidata="Q836674" url="?curid=274029" title="Music for the Jilted Generation">
<text>Music for the Jilted Generation is the second studio album by the English electronic music group the Prodigy. It was released on 4 July 1994 through XL Recordings.

The album combines a variety of genres, including rave and breakbeat, with heavy basslines and energetic, aggressive beats. Tracks such as No Good (Start the Dance) and Voodoo People exemplify a sound which helped define the 90s electronic music scene. As with the group&#x27;s debut album, Maxim Reality and Liam Howlett were the only official members of the group to contribute to the album. The other two members, Keith Flint and Leeroy Thornhill, were not credited on any tracks (although all four individuals were pictured in the liner notes).

&quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; was widely acclaimed for its innovative approach to electronic music, pushing the boundaries of dance and rave genres at the time. &quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; was a commercial success, solidifying The Prodigy’s place as one of the more influential acts in the genre. A remastered edition, &quot;More Music for the Jilted Generation&quot;, was released in 2008, featuring additional tracks and remixes.

== Music and content ==
&quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; incorporates elements of rave, breakbeat techno, techno, and hardcore techno. It was released on 4 July 1994 through XL Recordings.

The album is largely a response to the corruption of the rave scene in Britain by its mainstream success, as well as the United Kingdom&#x27;s Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which criminalised raves and aspects of rave culture. This is exemplified in the song &quot;Their Law&quot;, with the spoken-word intro and the predominant lyric: the &quot;Fuck &#x27;em and their law&quot; sample. Many years later, after the controversy had subsided, Liam Howlett criticised the album&#x27;s title, referring to it as &quot;stupid&quot;, and insisted that the album was never intended to be political.

Many of the samples featured on the album are sound clips from, or inspired by, films. &quot;Full Throttle&quot; contains a reversed sample from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, and &quot;The Heat (The Energy)&quot; features a sample from &quot;Poltergeist III&quot;, while &quot;Claustrophobic Sting&quot; includes a recreation of dialogue from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;.

When Liam Howlett arrived at the cutting room for the final stage of the album&#x27;s production, he realised that all the tracks he had planned would not fit onto a CD. As a result, &quot;One Love&quot; was edited down to approximately 3 minutes and 53 seconds, &quot;The Heat (The Energy)&quot; was slightly shortened, and &quot;We Eat Rhythm&quot; was omitted. &quot;We Eat Rhythm&quot; was later released on a free cassette with &quot;Select&quot; magazine in October 1994, titled &quot;Select Future Tracks&quot;. Howlett later stated that he felt the edited versions of &quot;One Love&quot; and &quot;Full Throttle&quot; could have been omitted from the track listing altogether.

It was licensed to Mute Records for a US release in February 1995.

=== Artwork ===
The album artwork for &quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; was designed by Stewart Haygarth (cover) and Les Edwards (inner). The inner artwork, which alludes to the conflicts between ravers and the police during the era of the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, is particularly well-regarded.

== Critical reception and legacy ==
&quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; received critical acclaim. In his review for &quot;NME&quot;, Dele Fadele called the album &quot;a stormy requiem for those under siege by the heavy-handed, almost fascistic Criminal Justice Bill&quot;, adding that the Prodigy &quot;show that you don&#x27;t need elaborate texts to send a message across, just hints by way of titles, sampled voices and dialogue, and a wide-ranging musical mood that fires the imagination.&quot; Andrew Harrison of &quot;Select&quot; deemed it &quot;possibly the best electronic pop record you&#x27;ll hear this year, the instant headrush of hardcore techno studded over with irresistible hooks and harnessed to a series of merciless grooves.&quot; In the United States, Robert Christgau praised it as &quot;one of the rare records that&#x27;s damn near everything you want cheap music to be&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Paul Evans noted that although its political subtext may be overlooked by American listeners, the &quot;truly trippy&quot; album &quot;generates universal dance fever.&quot; Comparing it with the Prodigy&#x27;s 1992 debut &quot;Experience&quot;, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; found that &quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; &quot;throws much darker shapes&quot; and &quot;slams harder and rawer and covers more ground&quot;. At the end of 1994, &quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; was named the year&#x27;s ninth-best album by &quot;NME&quot;, and it was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, John Bush lauded &quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; as &quot;an effective statement of intent&quot; in response to the Criminal Justice Act and noted the Prodigy&#x27;s move towards a &quot;grubbier&quot; and less sample-reliant sound, &quot;away from the American-influenced rave and acid house of the past and toward a uniquely British vision of breakbeat techno that was increasingly allied to the limey invention of drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Alexis Petridis said that the record &quot;broke free of &quot;Experience&quot;″s rave conventions into a style that was entirely the Prodigy&#x27;s own.&quot; &quot;Under the booming breakbeats, thrash guitars and inflammatory soundbites,&quot; commented &quot;Record Collector&quot;, &quot;Howlett&#x27;s supernova talent was on overdrive&quot;. In 2003, David Bowie named it among his favourite music from the 1990s, remarking that it &quot;was just an amazing record. It impressed me quite a lot.&quot;

&quot;Music for the Jilted Generation&quot; was listed by &quot;Spin&quot; as the 60th-best album of the 1990s. The album was ranked number 83 on &quot;Mojo&quot;″s list of 100 &quot;modern classics&quot; released from 1993 to 2006. It is also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2008, radio presenter Zane Lowe profiled the album on an episode of his BBC Radio 1 &quot;Masterpieces&quot; series.

Sam Francis was born in San Mateo, California, the son of Katherine Lewis Francis and Samuel Augustus Francis Sr. The 1935 death of his mother affected him deeply; she had encouraged his interest in music. He later developed a strong bond with his stepmother, Virginia Peterson Francis. He attended San Mateo High School in the early 1940s.

Francis served in the United States Air Force during World War II. In 1944, while in the Air Corps, he was diagnosed with spinal tuberculosis. He was in the hospital for several years, and it was while there, after being visited by artist David Park in 1945, that he began to paint. Once out of the hospital he returned to Berkeley, this time to study art. He received both his BA degree (1949) and MA degree (1950) in Art from the University of California, Berkeley, where he studied botany, medicine, and psychology.

==Career and artistic development==
Francis was initially influenced by the work of abstract expressionists such as Mark Rothko, Arshile Gorky and Clyfford Still. His loose style was most influenced by the work of Jackson Pollock. He later became loosely associated with the second generation of abstract expressionists, including Joan Mitchell and Helen Frankenthaler, who were increasingly interested in the expressive use of color. But Francis never fit neatly into any school of art. He charted his own trajectory as one of the first global artists working around the world.

He spent the 1950s in Paris, having his first exhibition there at the Galerie Nina Dausset in 1952. While in Paris he became associated with Tachisme, and had his work championed by art critics Michel Tapié and Claude Duthuit ( the son-in-law of the painter Henri Matisse).

Between 1950 and 1958 Francis spent time and painted in Paris, the south of France, Tokyo, Mexico City, Bern and New York. His artistic development was affected by his exposure to French modern painting, Asian culture and Zen Buddhism in particular. His paintings of the 1950s evolved through a series of stages, beginning with monochromatic abstractions, followed by larger richly colored murals and &quot;open&quot; paintings that feature large areas of whiteness. After his 1953 painting &quot;Big Red&quot; was included in the 1956 exhibition &quot;Twelve Artists&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Francis began a rapid rise to international prominence.

Francis painted large murals for the Kunsthalle, Basel in 1956-8 and for the Chase Manhattan Bank, New York in 1959.

Between 1960 and 1963 he created several series of works, including the &quot;Blue Balls&quot; series. Consisting of biomorphic predominantly blue forms and drips, these works referenced the pain that resulted from the renal tuberculosis that he suffered in 1961.

In the early to mid-1960s Francis was represented by the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York City. He returned to California during the 1960s and continued painting, mainly in Los Angeles, but also in Tokyo where he lived primarily in 1973-4. In 1965 Francis started a series of paintings that featured large areas of open canvas, minimal color and strong line. His work evolved further after he began intensive Jungian analysis with Dr. James Kirsch in 1971 and began paying careful attention to his dreams and the unconscious images they suggested.

Francis&#x27; works of the early 1970s have been referred to as Fresh Air pictures. Created by adding pools, drips and splatters of color to wet bands of paint applied with a roller, these works re-asserted the artist&#x27;s interest in color. By 1973–4 many of Francis&#x27; paintings featured a formal grid or matrix made up of crossing tracks of color. Many of these matrix works were large in scale, measuring up to twenty feet long.

After 1980 the formal structure of the grid gradually disappeared from Francis&#x27; work. He was extremely active as a printmaker, creating numerous etchings, lithographs and monotypes, many of which were executed in Santa Monica at the Litho Shop, which Francis owned.

In 1984 Francis founded the Lapis Press with the goal of producing unusual and timely texts in visually compelling formats.

During the last year of his life, suffering from prostate cancer and unable to paint with his right hand after a fall, in a final burst of energy he used his left hand to complete a dazzling series of about 150 small paintings before he died. He died in Santa Monica and was buried in Olema, in Marin County, California.

==Personal life==
Sam Francis was married five times, and was the father of four children. He was married from 1947 through 1952 to Vera Miller, a high school girlfriend, then to California painter Muriel Goodwin (1955–58) then to Japanese painter Teruko Yokoi with whom he had a daughter, Kayo. In 1966 he married Mako Idemitsu, with whom he had two sons: Osamu and Shingo.

He married his last wife, painter Margaret Smith, in a Shinto ceremony in Japan in 1985. Their son Augustus, born in 1986, is also an artist.

==International reputation==

Because he worked and exhibited in the United States, Europe and Asia, Sam Francis is credited with helping secure international recognition for postwar American painting. His work has been seen most often and best understood in Europe and Japan. In 1991, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.

===International collections===

Paintings by Sam Francis can be found in international museum collections including those of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, The [Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena, California], The Kunstmuseum Basel, the Idemitsu Museum of Arts, Tokyo, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Centre Pompidou-Musee National d&#x27;Art Moderne, Paris.

== Legacy ==

===Auction records===

On May 11, 2010, a 1957 Francis painting titled &quot;Middle Blue&quot; was sold at auction for $6,354,500, a record for the artist. On May 15, 2013, &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot;, a 1958 watercolor and gouache on paper, set the record for a Francis work on paper, selling at Sotheby&#x27;s for $1,145,000. On May 11, 2016, &quot;Summer #1&quot;, a 1957 Francis oil on canvas, sold for $11,842,000, a new world record for the artist. This painting was acquired by the collector Eli Broad. On November 9, 2022, &quot;Composition in black and blue&quot;, a 1955 Francis oil on canvas, sold for $13,557,500 at the Paul Allen sale at Christies, New York.

===Foundation===
In the wake of the artist&#x27;s death, the Sam Francis Foundation was founded. Its stated mission is to &quot;research, document, protect and perpetuate the creative legacy of the artist&quot; and &quot;promote awareness of and knowledge about the art of Sam Francis to the public through education and information.&quot; The United States copyright representative for the Francis Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.

The foundation published, in collaboration with the University of California Press, a Catalogue Raisonné of Francis&#x27; Canvas and Panel Paintings, 1946 – 1994. The catalogue consists of both a printed book and 2 DVDs which document 1,855 Francis paintings. There are also photos, writings by and about Francis, and films of Francis at work. Foundation director Debra Burchett-Lere is currently working on a second volume which will feature all of the artist&#x27;s known unique works on paper. The foundation has a page dedicated to locating any &quot;missing works&quot;, and requests information from any parties who can assist in their location.

===Documentary===
In 2010, artist and filmmaker Jeffrey Perkins released the documentary &quot;The Painter Sam Francis&quot;. The documentary includes film of Francis at work, filmed between 1968 and the early &#x27;90s, together with interviews with friends, family, and professional associates of Francis.

<doc id="274033" wikidata="Q1070883" url="?curid=274033" title="Experience (The Prodigy album)">
<text>Experience (also known as The Prodigy Experience) is the debut studio album by English electronic music group the Prodigy. It was released on 28 September 1992 by XL Recordings.

== Album information ==

Liam Howlett was the sole composer; of the additional three members at that time, only Maxim Reality actually contributed to the album, performing the vocals on the last track. A wide variety of artists in the breakbeat hardcore scene in the early 1990s are given respect and namechecked in the sleeve notes of the album, including SL2, Carl Cox, Moby, Tim Westwood, Orbital and Aphex Twin. &quot;Experience&quot; peaked at No. 12 in the UK Albums Chart and went on to achieve platinum status in that country. It was later licensed to Elektra Records for release in the United States.

== Reception ==
From contemporary reviews, Kris Needs of &quot;NME&quot; declared that &quot;the time-pod to enable future generations to get a handle on what happened in 1992, The Prodigy&#x27;s debut album will be a much safer bet to illustrate the Rave Phenomenon than any half-assed &quot;40 Bowel-Erupting Rave Greats&quot; compilation. If only to show what killed it, some would say.&quot;

&quot;Experience&quot; received very positive reviews upon its release. In a posthumous AllMusic gave the album 5 out of 5 stars, saying that it &quot;shows the Prodigy near the peak of their game from the get go&quot; and stating that &quot;almost every song sounds like a potential chart topper&quot;. Tom Ewing of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; commended the album as &quot;four-minute-warnings, [...] hyperactive ravey blasts which boasted genuine irreverence rather than learned attitude.&quot;

Moby credited &quot;Experience&quot; with changing his perception about dance albums; previously he felt that &quot;dance albums had always failed [...] because they didn&#x27;t work over the full length of the record. Mostly they were singles collections which was exactly what I didn&#x27;t want to do,&quot; and noted that &quot;Experience&quot; &quot;impressed me because they&#x27;d managed to create a full listening experience which encompassed various styles. This was the kind of vision I had for my debut album.&quot;

<doc id="274034" wikidata="Q1653122" url="?curid=274034" title="IBM PC Convertible">
<text>The IBM PC Convertible (model 5140) is a laptop computer made by IBM, first sold in April 1986. The Convertible was IBM&#x27;s first laptop-style computer, following the luggable IBM Portable, and introduced the 3½-inch floppy disk format to the IBM product line. Like modern laptops, it featured power management and the ability to run from batteries.

It was replaced in 1991 by the IBM PS/2 L40 SX, and in Japan by the IBM Personal System/55note, the predecessor to the ThinkPad.

==Predecessors==
IBM had been working on a laptop for some time before the Convertible. In 1983, work was underway on a laptop similar to the Tandy Model 100, codenamed &quot;Sweetpea&quot;, but it was rejected by Don Estridge for not being PC compatible. Another attempt in 1984 produced the &quot;P-14&quot; prototype machine, but it failed to pass IBM&#x27;s human factors tests, especially after poor public reception of the display in the competing Data General-One.

==Description==
The PC Convertible came in three models: PC Convertible, PC Convertible Model 2 and PC Convertible Model 3. The latter two were released in October 1987 and are primarily distinguished by their LCD panels. The original Convertible used a non-backlit panel which was considered difficult to read. The Model 2 lacked a backlight as well but upgraded to an improved supertwist panel, and the Model 3 included a backlight. The other hardware specifications are largely the same for all three models.

The CPU is an Intel 80C88, the CMOS version of the Intel 8088 CPU. The base configuration included of RAM, expandable to , dual 3.5-inch floppy drives, and a monochrome, CGA-compatible LCD screen. It weighed just over 12 pounds and featured a built-in carrying handle, with a battery rated for 10 hours (4 hours in the backlit Model 3).

The first model was introduced at a price of , the Model 2 at with 256K of RAM and with 640K, and the Model 3 at with 256K of RAM.

The LCD screen displayed characters, but has a very wide aspect ratio, so text characters and graphics are compressed vertically, appearing half their normal height. The display is capable of text and graphics modes of and pixels. 

The PC Convertible has expansion capabilities through a proprietary ISA-based port on the rear of the machine. Extension modules, including a small printer and a video output module, were provided as plastic modules that snap into place. The machine can also take an internal modem, but has no room for an internal hard disk. The concept and the design of the body was made by German industrial designer Richard Sapper.

Pressing the power button on the computer does not turn it off, but puts the machine into &quot;suspend&quot; mode, which will hold the machine&#x27;s state as long as battery power lasts, to save on boot time. The CMOS 80C88 CPU has a static core, which holds its state indefinitely by stopping the system clock oscillator, and can resume processing when the clock signal is restarted as long as it is kept powered. The system RAM in the Convertible is SRAM rather than DRAM, both for lower power consumption and less circuitry to fit into the cramped laptop case.

Pressing a lever between the two floppy drives just below the display detaches the entire screen from the unit. This feature allows the use of a full-size desktop monitor while at one&#x27;s desk, an early forerunner of the &quot;docking station&quot; concept, and similar to Apple&#x27;s PowerBook Duo.

==Reception==
The machine had difficulty in the marketplace and was seen as a poor value for money, since other laptops in the market had more built-in features, although it enjoyed some success with business users, who saw its battery life and portability as selling points. Even after the release of the Model 3 in October 1987, which fixed some of the machine&#x27;s issues, lack of built-in features remained a pain point. The parallel, serial and video ports all required adapters, while competing machines included these as integrated features. The Convertible was heavy, not much faster than the Portable it replaced, had no traditional PC expansion ports (such as serial ports and a parallel port) without an add-on, and had a hard-to-read, oddly-shaped LCD screen. It also competed against faster portables based on the Intel 80286 that offered optional hard drives, from companies such as Compaq, and laptops from companies such as Toshiba and Zenith that were lighter and offered similar specifications, sometimes at half the price. The keyboard was also criticized for lacking several important keys.

<text>Quantitative marketing research is the application of quantitative research techniques to the field of marketing research. It has roots in both the positivist view of the world, and the modern marketing viewpoint that marketing is an interactive process in which both the buyer and seller reach a satisfying agreement on the &quot;four Ps&quot; of marketing: Product, Price, Place (location) and Promotion.

As a social research method, it typically involves the construction of questionnaires and scales. People who respond (respondents) are asked to complete the survey. Marketers use the information to obtain and understand the needs of individuals in the marketplace, and to create strategies and marketing plans.

==Data collection==
The most popular quantitative marketing research method is a survey. Surveys typically contain a combination of structured questions and open questions. Survey participants respond to the same set of questions, which allows the researcher to easily compare responses by different types of respondent. Surveys can be distributed in one of four ways: telephone, mail, in-person and online (whether by mobile or desktop).

Another quantitative research method is to conduct experiments into how individuals respond to different situations or scenarios. One example of this is A/B testing of a piece of marketing communications, such as a website landing page. Website visitors are shown different versions of the landing page, and marketers track which is more effective.

==Differences between consumer and B2B quantitative research==
Quantitative research is used in both consumer research and business-to-business (B2B) research. However, there are differences in how consumer researchers and B2B researchers distribute their surveys.
Generally, surveys are distributed online more than in-person, by telephone or by mail. However, in B2B research, online research is not always possible, often because it is difficult to get hold of certain business decision-makers via email. As a result, B2B researchers still often conduct surveys via telephone.

==Typical general procedure==
Simply put, there are five major and important steps involved in the research process:

#Defining the problem.
#Research design.
#Data collection.
#Data analysis.
#Report writing &amp; presentation.

A brief discussion on these steps is:

# Problem audit and problem definition - What is the problem? What are the various aspects of the problem? What information is needed?
# Conceptualization and operationalization - How exactly do we define the concepts involved? How do we translate these concepts into observable and measurable behaviours?
# Hypothesis specification - What claim(s) do we want to test?
# Research design specification - What type of methodology to use? - examples: questionnaire, survey
# Question specification - What questions to ask? In what order?
# Scale specification - How will preferences be rated?
# Sampling design specification - What is the total population? What sample size is necessary for this population? What sampling method to use?- examples: Probability Sampling:- (cluster sampling, stratified sampling, simple random sampling, multistage sampling, systematic sampling) &amp; Nonprobability sampling:- (Convenience Sampling, Judgement Sampling, Purposive Sampling, Quota Sampling, Snowball Sampling, etc. )
# Data collection - Use mail, telephone, internet, mall intercepts
# Codification and re-specification - Make adjustments to the raw data so it is compatible with statistical techniques and with the objectives of the research - examples: assigning numbers, consistency checks, substitutions, deletions, weighting, dummy variables, scale transformations, scale standardization
# Statistical analysis - Perform various descriptive and inferential techniques (see below) on the raw data. Make inferences from the sample to the whole population. Test the results for statistical significance.
# Interpret and integrate findings - What do the results mean? What conclusions can be drawn? How do these findings relate to similar research?
# Write the research report - Report usually has headings such as: 1) executive summary; 2) objectives; 3) methodology; 4) main findings; 5) detailed charts and diagrams. Present the report to the client in a 10-minute presentation. Be prepared for questions.

The design step may involve a pilot study in order to discover any hidden issues. The codification and analysis steps are typically performed by computer, using statistical software. The data collection steps, can in some instances be automated, but often require significant manpower to undertake. Interpretation is a skill mastered only by experience.

==Statistical analysis==

The data acquired for quantitative marketing research can be analysed by almost any of the range of techniques of statistical analysis, which can be broadly divided into descriptive statistics and statistical inference. An important set of techniques is that related to statistical surveys. In any instance, an appropriate type of statistical analysis should take account of the various types of error that may arise, as outlined below.

===Reliability and validity===

Research should be tested for reliability, generalizability, and validity.

Generalizability is the ability to make inferences from a sample to the population.

Reliability is the extent to which a measure will produce consistent results.
* &quot;Test-retest reliability&quot; checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated under similar circumstances. Stability over repeated measures is assessed with the Pearson coefficient.
* &quot;Alternative forms reliability&quot; checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated using different forms.
* &quot;Internal consistency reliability&quot; checks how well the individual measures included in the research are converted into a composite measure. Internal consistency may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test (split-half reliability). The value of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is adjusted with the Spearman–Brown prediction formula to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests. A commonly used measure is Cronbach&#x27;s α, which is equivalent to the mean of all possible split-half coefficients. Reliability may be improved by increasing the sample size.

Validity asks whether the research measured what it intended to.
* &quot;Content validation&quot; (also called face validity) checks how well the content of the research are related to the variables to be studied; it seeks to answer whether the research questions are representative of the variables being researched. It is a demonstration that the items of a test are drawn from the domain being measured.
* &quot;Criterion validation&quot; checks how meaningful the research criteria are relative to other possible criteria. When the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish predictive validity.
* &quot;Construct validation&quot; checks what underlying construct is being measured. There are three variants of construct validity: &quot;convergent validity&quot; (how well the research relates to other measures of the same construct), &quot;discriminant validity&quot; (how poorly the research relates to measures of opposing constructs), and &quot;nomological validity&quot; (how well the research relates to other variables as required by theory).
* &quot;Internal validation&quot;, used primarily in experimental research designs, checks the relation between the dependent and independent variables (i.e. Did the experimental manipulation of the independent variable actually cause the observed results?)
* &quot;External validation&quot; checks whether the experimental results can be generalized.

Validity implies reliability: A valid measure must be reliable. Reliability does not necessarily imply validity, however: A reliable measure does not imply that it is valid.

===Types of errors===
Random sampling errors:
*sample too small
*sample not representative
*inappropriate sampling method used
*random errors
Research design errors:
*bias introduced
*measurement error
*data analysis error
*sampling frame error
*population definition error
*scaling error
*question construction error
Interviewer errors:
*recording errors
*cheating errors
*questioning errors
*respondent selection error
Respondent errors:
*non-response error
*inability error
*falsification error
Hypothesis errors:
*type I error (also called alpha error)
**the study results lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis even though it is actually true
*type II error (also called beta error)
**the study results lead to the acceptance (non-rejection) of the null hypothesis even though it is actually false

<doc id="274047" wikidata="Q690959" url="?curid=274047" title="Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire">
<text>The revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire took place from March 1848 to November 1849. Much of the revolutionary activity had a nationalist character: the Austrian Empire, ruled from Vienna, included ethnic Germans, Hungarians, Poles, Bohemians (Czechs), Ruthenians (Ukrainians), Slovenes, Slovaks, Romanians, Croats, Italians, and Serbs; all of whom attempted in the course of the revolution to either achieve autonomy, independence, or even hegemony over other nationalities. The nationalist picture was further complicated by the simultaneous events in the German states, which moved toward greater German national unity.

Besides these nationalists, liberal, and even socialist currents resisted the Empire&#x27;s longstanding conservatism.

==Background==
The events of 1848 were the product of mounting social and political tensions after the Congress of Vienna of 1815. During the &quot;pre-March&quot; period, the already conservative Austrian Empire moved further away from ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, restricted freedom of the press, limited many university activities, and banned fraternities.

===Social and political conflict===

Conflicts between debtors and creditors in agricultural production as well as over land use rights in parts of Hungary led to conflicts that occasionally erupted into violence. Conflict over organized religion was pervasive in pre-1848 Europe. Tension came both from within Catholicism and between members of different confessions. These conflicts were often mixed with conflict with the state. As 1848 approached, the revolutions the Empire crushed to maintain longstanding conservative minister Klemens Wenzel von Metternich&#x27;s Concert of Europe left the empire nearly bankrupt and in continual need of soldiers. Civil conscription led to brawls between soldiers and civilians. All of this further agitated the peasantry, who resented their remaining feudal obligations.

Despite lack of freedom of the press and association, there was a flourishing liberal German culture among students and those educated in German universities. They published pamphlets and newspapers discussing education and language; the need for basic liberal reforms was assumed. These middle class liberals largely understood and accepted that forced labor is not efficient, and that the Empire should adopt a wage labor system. The question was how to institute such reforms.

Notable liberal clubs of the time in Vienna included the Legal-Political Reading Club (established 1842) and Concordia Society (1840). They, like the Lower Austrian Manufacturers&#x27; Association (1840) were part of a culture that criticized Metternich&#x27;s government from the city&#x27;s coffeehouses, salons, and even stages, but prior to 1848 their demands had not even extended to constitutionalism or freedom of assembly, let alone republicanism. They had merely advocated relaxed censorship, freedom of religion, economic freedoms, and, above all, a more competent administration. They were opposed to outright popular sovereignty and the universal franchise.

More to the left was a radicalized, impoverished intelligentsia. Educational opportunities in 1840s Austria had far outstripped employment opportunities for the educated.

=== Industrial revolution ===
The industrial revolution, which spread to Austria in the 1840s, has been cited as a key factor leading up to the 1848 revolution, and argued to be a far greater contributor than intellectual developments in the 19th century. The industrial revolution had hurt small businesses and brought poor working conditions, which made ordinary citizens - namely the middle and lower classes - more receptive to revolutionary thought.

===Direct cause of the outbreak of violence===
In 1845, potato blight arrived in Belgium from North America, thus starting the Hungry Forties. As the disease quickly spread throughout Europe, the major calorie source for the poorer population failed and food prices soared. In 1846 there had been an uprising of Polish nobility in Austrian Galicia, which was only countered when peasants, in turn, rose up against the nobles. The economic crisis of 1845–47 was marked by recession and food shortages throughout the continent. At the end of February 1848, demonstrations broke out in Paris. Louis Philippe of France abdicated the throne, prompting similar revolts throughout the continent.

==Revolution in the Austrian lands==

===An early victory leads to tension===

After news broke of the February victories in Paris, uprisings occurred throughout Europe, including in Vienna, where the Diet (parliament) of Lower Austria at Niederösterreichisches Landeshaus (Estates House of Lower Austria) in March demanded the resignation of Prince Metternich, the conservative State Chancellor and Foreign Minister. With no forces rallying to Metternich&#x27;s defense, nor word from Ferdinand I of Austria to the contrary, he resigned on 13 March. Metternich fled to London, and Ferdinand appointed new, nominally liberal, ministers. By November, the Austrian Empire saw several short-lived liberal governments under five successive minister-presidents of Austria: Count Kolowrat (17 March–4 April), Count Ficquelmont (4 April–3 May), Baron Pillersdorf (3 May–8 July), Baron Doblhoff-Dier (8 July–18 July) and Baron Wessenberg (19 July–20 November).

The established order collapsed rapidly because of the weakness of the Austrian armies. Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky was unable to keep his soldiers fighting Venetian and Milanese insurgents in Lombardy-Venetia, and instead had to order the remaining troops to evacuate.

Social and political conflict as well as inter and intra confessional hostility momentarily subsided as much of the continent rejoiced in the liberal victories. Mass political organizations and public participation in government became widespread.

However, liberal ministers were unable to establish central authority. Provisional governments in Venice and Milan quickly expressed a desire to be part of an Italian confederacy of states; for the Venetian government this lasted only five days, after the 1848 armistice between Austria and Piedmont. A new Hungarian government in Pest announced its intentions to break away from the Empire and elect Ferdinand its King, and a Polish National Committee announced the same for the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.

===Social and political tensions after the &quot;Springtime of Peoples&quot;===
The victory of the party of movement was looked at as an opportunity for lower classes to renew old conflicts with greater anger and energy. Several tax boycotts and attempted murders of tax collectors occurred in Vienna. Assaults against soldiers were common, including against Radetzky&#x27;s troops retreating from Milan. The archbishop of Vienna was forced to flee, and in Graz, the convent of the Jesuits was destroyed.

The demands of nationalism and its contradictions became apparent as new national governments began declaring power and unity. Charles Albert of Sardinia, King of Piedmont-Savoy, initiated a nationalist war on March 23 in the Austrian held northern Italian provinces that would consume the attention of the entire peninsula. The German nationalist movement faced the question of whether or not Austria should be included in the united German state, a quandary that divided the Frankfurt National Assembly. The liberal ministers in Vienna were willing to allow elections for the German National Assembly in some of the Habsburg lands, but it was undetermined by which Habsburg territories would participate. Hungary and Galicia were clearly not German; German nationalists (who dominated the Bohemian Diet) felt the old crown lands rightfully belonged to a united German state, despite the fact that the majority of the people of Bohemia and Moravia spoke Czech — a Slavic language. Czech nationalists viewed the language as far more significant, calling for a boycott of the Frankfurt Parliament elections in Bohemia, Moravia, and neighboring Austrian Silesia (also partly Czech-speaking). Tensions in Prague between German and Czech nationalists grew quickly between April and May. After the abolition of serfdom on April 17, Supreme Ruthenian Council was established in Galicia to promote the unification of ethnic Ukrainian lands of Eastern Galicia, Transcarpathia and Bukovina in one province. Ukrainian language department was opened in Lviv University, and the first Ukrainian newspaper &quot;Zoria Halytska&quot; started publishing in Lviv on May 15, 1848. On July 1, serfdom was also abolished in Bukovina.
By early summer, conservative regimes had been overthrown, new freedoms (including freedom of the press and freedom of association) had been introduced, and multiple nationalist claims had been exerted. New parliaments quickly held elections with broad franchise to create constituent assemblies, which would write new constitutions. The elections that were held produced unexpected results. The new voters, naïve and confused by their new political power, typically elected conservative or moderately liberal representatives. The radicals, the ones who supported the broadest franchise, lost under the system they advocated because they were not the locally influential and affluent men. The mixed results led to confrontations similar to the &quot;June Days&quot; uprising in Paris. Additionally, these constituent assemblies were charged with the impossible task of managing both the needs of the people of the state and determining what that state physically is at the same time. The Austrian Constituent Assembly was divided into a Czech faction, a German faction, and a Polish faction, and within each faction was the political left-right spectrum. Outside the Assembly, petitions, newspapers, mass demonstrations, and political clubs put pressure on their new governments and often expressed violently many of the debates that were occurring within the assembly itself.

The Czechs held a Pan-Slavic congress in Prague between June 2 and June 12, 1848. It was primarily composed of Austroslavs who wanted greater freedom within the Empire, but their status as peasants and proletarians surrounded by a German middle class doomed their autonomy . They also disliked the prospect of annexation of Bohemia to a German Empire.

===Counterrevolution===

Insurgents quickly lost in street fighting to King Ferdinand&#x27;s troops led by General Radetzky, prompting several liberal government ministers to resign in protest. Ferdinand, now restored to power in Vienna, appointed conservatives in their places. These actions were a considerable blow to the revolutionaries, and by August most of northern Italy was under Radetzky&#x27;s control.

In Bohemia, the leaders of both the German and Czech nationalist movements were both constitutional monarchists, loyal to the Habsburg Emperor. Only a few days after the Emperor reconquered northern Italy, Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz took provocative measures in Prague to prompt street fighting. Once the barricades went up, he led Habsburg troops to crush the insurgents. After having taken back the city, he imposed martial law, ordered the Prague National Committee dissolved, and sent delegates to the &quot;Pan-Slavic&quot; Congress home. These events were applauded by German nationalists, who failed to understand that the Habsburg military would crush their own national movement as well.

Attention then turned to Hungary. War in Hungary again threatened imperial rule and prompted Emperor Ferdinand and his court to once more flee Vienna. Viennese radicals welcomed the arrival of Hungarian troops as the only force able to stand up against the court and ministry. The radicals took control of the city for only a short period of time. Windisch-Grätz led soldiers from Prussia to quickly defeat the insurgents. Windisch-Grätz restored imperial authority to the city. The reconquering of Vienna was seen as a defeat over German nationalism. At this point, Ferdinand I named the noble Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg head of government. Schwarzenberg, a consummate statesman, persuaded the feeble-minded Ferdinand to abdicate the throne to his 18-year-old nephew, Franz Joseph. Parliamentarians continued to debate, but had no authority on state policy.

Both the Czech and Italian revolutions were defeated by the Habsburgs. Prague was the first victory of counter-revolution in the Austrian Empire.

Lombardy-Venetia was quickly brought back under Austrian rule in the mainland, even because popular support for the revolution vanished: revolutionary ideals were often limited to part of middle and upper classes, which failed both to gain &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of lower classes and to convince the population about Italian nationalism. Most part of lower classes indeed were quite indifferent, and actually most part of Lombard and Venetian troops remained loyal. The only widespread support to the revolution was in the cities of Milan and Venice, with the Republic of San Marco lasting under siege until 28th of August, 1849.

==Revolution in the Kingdom of Hungary==

The Hungarian Diet was reconvened in 1825 to handle financial needs. A liberal party emerged in the Diet. The party focused on providing for the peasantry in mostly symbolic ways because of their inability to understand the needs of the laborers. Lajos Kossuth emerged as the leader of the lower gentry in the Diet.
In 1848, news of the outbreak of revolution in Paris arrived as a new national cabinet took power under Kossuth, and the Diet approved a sweeping reform package, referred to as the &quot;April laws&quot; (also &quot;March laws&quot;), that changed almost every aspect of Hungary&#x27;s economic, social, and political life: (The April laws based on the 12 points:

*Freedom of the Press (The abolition of censure and the censor&#x27;s offices)
*Accountable ministries in Buda and Pest (Instead of the simple royal appointment of ministers, all ministers and the government must be elected and dismissed by the parliament)
*An annual parliamentary session in Pest. (instead of the rare ad-hoc sessions which was convoked by the king) 
*Civil and religious equality before the law. (The abolition of separate laws for the common people and nobility, the abolition of the legal privileges of nobility. Full religious liberty instead of moderated tolerance: the abolition of (Catholic) state religion)
*National Guard. (The forming of their own Hungarian national guard, it worked like a police force to keep the law and order during the transition of the system, thus preserving the morality of the revolution)
*Joint share of tax burdens. (abolition of the tax exemption of the nobility, the abolition of customs and tariff exemption of the nobility)
*The abolition of socage. (abolition of Feudalism and abolition of the serfdom of peasantry and their bondservices)
*Juries and representation on an equal basis. (The common people can be elected as juries at the legal courts, all people can be officials even on the highest levels of the public administration and judicature, if they have the prescribed education) 
*National Bank. 
*The army to swear to support the constitution, our soldiers should not be sent to abroad, and foreign soldiers should leave our country.
*The freeing of political prisoners. 
*Union with Transylvania

In April 1848, Hungary became the third country of Continental Europe (after France, in 1791, and Belgium, in 1831) to enact a law implementing democratic parliamentary elections.
The new suffrage law (Act V of 1848) transformed the old feudal parliament (Estates General) into a democratic representative parliament. This law offered the widest right to vote in Europe at the time. The April laws utterly erased all privileges of the Hungarian nobility.

These demands were not easy for the imperial court to accept, however, its weak position provided little choice. One of the first tasks of the Diet was abolishing serfdom, which was announced on March 18, 1848.

The Hungarian government set limits on the political activity of both the Croatian and Romanian national movements. Croats and Romanians had their own desires for self-rule and saw no benefit in replacing one central government for another. Armed clashes between the Hungarians and the Croats, Romanians, Serbs, along one border and Slovaks on the other ensued. In some cases, this was a continuation and an escalation of previous tensions, such as the 1845 July victims in Croatia.

The Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia and the Kingdom of Slavonia severed relations with the new Hungarian government in Pest and devoted itself to the imperial cause. Conservative Josip Jelačić, who was appointed the new ban of Croatia-Slavonia in March by the imperial court, was removed from his position by the constitutional monarchist Hungarian government. He refused to give up his authority in the name of the monarch. Thus, there were two governments in Hungary issuing contradictory orders in the name of Ferdinand von Habsburg.
Aware that they were on the path to civil war in mid-1848, the Hungarian government ministers attempted to gain Habsburg support against Jelačić by offering to send troops to northern Italy. Additionally, they attempted to come to terms with Jelačić himself, but he insisted on the recentralization of Habsburg authority as a pre-condition to any talks. By the end of August, the imperial government in Vienna officially ordered the Hungarian government in Pest to end plans for a Hungarian army. Jelačić then took military action against the Hungarian government without any official order.

The national assembly of the Serbs in Austrian Empire was held between 1 and 3 May 1848 in Sremski Karlovci, during which the Serbs proclaimed autonomous Habsburg crownland of Serbian Vojvodina. The war started, leading to clashes as such in Srbobran, where on July 14, 1848, the first siege of the town by Hungarian forces began under Baron Fülöp Berchtold. The army was forced to retreat due to a strong Serbian defense. With war raging on three fronts (against Romanians and Serbs in Banat and Bačka, and Romanians in Transylvania), Hungarian radicals in Pest saw this as an opportunity. Parliament made concessions to the radicals in September rather than let the events erupt into violent confrontations. Shortly thereafter, the final break between Vienna and Pest occurred when Field Marshal Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg was given control of all armies in Hungary (including Jelačić&#x27;s). In response to Lamberg being attacked on arrival in Hungary a few days later, the imperial court ordered the Hungarian parliament and government dissolved. Jelačić was appointed to take Lamberg&#x27;s place. War between Austria and Hungary had officially begun.

The war led to the October Crisis in Vienna, when insurgents attacked a garrison on its way to Hungary to support Croatian forces under Jelačić.

After Vienna was recaptured by imperial forces, General Windischgrätz and 70,000 troops were sent to Hungary to crush the Hungarian revolution and as they advanced the Hungarian government evacuated Pest. However the Austrian army had to retreat after heavy defeats in the Spring Campaign of the Hungarian Army from March to May 1849. Instead of pursuing the Austrian army, the Hungarians stopped to retake the Fort of Buda and prepared defenses. In June 1849 Russian and Austrian troops entered Hungary heavily outnumbering the Hungarian army. Kossuth abdicated on August 11, 1849, in favour of Artúr Görgey, who he thought was the only general who was capable of saving the nation. 
However, in May 1849, Czar Nicholas I pledged to redouble his efforts against the Hungarian Government. He and Emperor Franz Joseph started to regather and rearm an army to be commanded by Anton Vogl, the Austrian lieutenant-field-marshal. The Czar was also preparing to send 30,000 Russian soldiers back over the Eastern Carpathian Mountains from Poland.

On August 13, after several bitter defeats in a hopeless situation Görgey, signed a surrender at Világos (now Şiria, Romania) to the Russians, who handed the army over to the Austrians.

===Slovak Uprising===
Slovak Uprising was an uprising of Slovaks against Magyar (i.e. ethnic Hungarian) domination in the Western parts of Upper Hungary (present-day Western Slovakia), within the 1848/49 revolution in the Habsburg Monarchy. It lasted from September 1848 to November 1849. During this period Slovak patriots established the Slovak National Council as their political representation and military units known as the Slovak Volunteer Corps. 
The political, social and national requirements of the Slovak movement were declared in the document entitled &quot;Demands of the Slovak Nation&quot; from April 1848.

===Serb Revolution of 1848–1849===

The Serb Revolution of 1848 was an uprising of Serbs living in Délvidék against Magyar domination. The majority of the Serbs there sided with the Austrians. However, there were also some exceptions, e.g. General János Damjanich of the Hungarian Revolutionary Army.

==The Second Wave of Revolutions==

Revolutionary movements of 1849 faced an additional challenge: to work together to defeat a common enemy. Previously, national identity allowed Habsburg forces to conquer revolutionary governments by playing them off one another. New democratic initiatives in Italy in the spring of 1848 led to a renewed conflict with Austrian forces in the provinces of Lombardy and Venetia. At the very first anniversary of the first barricades in Vienna, German and Czech democrats in Bohemia agreed to put mutual hostilities aside and work together on revolutionary planning. Hungarians faced the greatest challenge of overcoming the divisions of the previous year, as the fighting there had been the most bitter. Despite this, the Hungarian government hired a new commander and attempted to unite with Romanian democrat Avram Iancu, who was known as &quot;Crăişorul Munţilor&quot; (&quot;The Prince of the Mountains&quot;). However, division and mistrust were too severe.

Three days after the start of hostilities in Italy, Charles Albert of Sardinia abdicated the throne of Piedmont-Savoy, essentially ending the Piedmontese return to war. Renewed military conflicts cost the Empire the little that remained of its finances. Another challenge to Habsburg authority came from Germany and the question of either &quot;big Germany&quot; (united Germany led by Austria) or &quot;little Germany&quot; (united Germany led by Prussia). The Frankfurt National Assembly proposed a constitution with Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia as monarch of a united federal Germany composed of only &#x27;German&#x27; lands. This would have led to the relationship between Austria and Hungary (as a &#x27;non-German&#x27; area) being reduced to a personal union under the Habsburgs, rather than a united state, an unacceptable arrangement for both the Habsburgs and Austro-German liberals in Austria. In the end, Friedrich Wilhelm refused to accept the constitution written by the Assembly. Schwarzenberg dissolved the Hungarian Parliament in 1849, imposing his own constitution that conceded nothing to the liberal movement. Appointing Alexander Bach head of internal affairs, he oversaw the creation of the Bach system, which rooted out political dissent and contained liberals within Austria and quickly returned the status quo. After the deportation of Lajos Kossuth, a nationalist Hungarian leader, Schwarzenberg faced uprisings by Hungarians. Playing on the long-standing Russian tradition of conservativism, he convinced Tsar Nicholas I to send Russian forces in. The Russian army quickly destroyed the rebellion, forcing the Hungarians back under Austrian control. In less than three years, Schwarzenberg had returned stability and control to Austria. However, Schwarzenberg had a stroke in 1852, and his successors failed to uphold the control Schwarzenberg had so successfully maintained.

<doc id="274048" wikidata="Q3699" url="?curid=274048" title="German revolutions of 1848–1849">
<text>The German revolutions of 1848–1849 (), the opening phase of which was also called the March Revolution (), were initially part of the Revolutions of 1848 that broke out in many European countries. They were a series of loosely coordinated protests and rebellions in the states of the German Confederation, including the Austrian Empire. The revolutions, which stressed pan-Germanism, liberalism and parliamentarianism, demonstrated popular discontent with the traditional, largely autocratic political structure of the thirty-nine independent states of the Confederation that inherited the German territory of the former Holy Roman Empire after its dismantlement as a result of the Napoleonic Wars. This process began in the mid-1840s.

The middle-class elements were committed to liberal principles, while the working class sought radical improvements to their working and living conditions. As the middle class and working class components of the Revolution split, the conservative aristocracy defeated it. Liberals were forced into exile to escape political persecution, where they became known as Forty-Eighters. Many emigrated to the United States, settling from Wisconsin to Texas.

== Events leading up to the revolutions ==
The groundwork of the 1848 uprising was laid as early as the Hambacher Fest of 1832, when public unrest began to grow in the face of heavy taxation and political censorship. The Hambacher Fest is also noteworthy for the Republicans adopting the black-red-gold colours used on today&#x27;s national flag of Germany as a symbol of the Republican movement and of the unity among the German-speaking people. The song &quot;Fürsten zum Land Hinaus!&quot; originated from the festival, and quickly garnered popular support for the abolition of monarchy and establishment of a Republic.

Activism for liberal reforms spread through many of the German states, each of which had distinct revolutions. They were also inspired by the street demonstrations in Paris, France, led by workers and artisans which took place through 22 to 24 February 1848, and resulted in the abdication of King Louis-Philippe of France and his exile to Britain. In France the revolution of 1848 became known as the February Revolution.

The revolutions spread from France across Europe; demonstrations against the government erupted soon thereafter in both Austria and Germany, beginning with large protests on 13 March 1848, in Vienna. This resulted in the resignation of Prince von Metternich as chief minister to Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria, and his going into exile in Britain. Because of the date of the Vienna demonstrations, the protests throughout Germany are usually called the March Revolution ().

Afraid of suffering the same fate as Louis-Philippe of France, some of the German monarchs acquiesced to the demands of the revolutionaries, at least temporarily. In the south and west, large popular assemblies and mass demonstrations took place. They demanded freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, written constitutions, arming of the people and a Parliament.

== Austria == 

In 1848, Austria was the predominant German state. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, which had been dissolved by Napoleon in 1806, it was succeeded by a similarly loose coalition of states known as the German Confederation at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. Austria served as President &quot;ex officio&quot; of this confederation. The (German) Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich had dominated Austrian politics from 1815 until 1848.
On 13 March 1848, university students mounted a large street demonstration in Vienna, and it was covered by the press across the German-speaking states. Following the important, but relatively minor, demonstrations against Lola Montez in Bavaria on 9 February 1848 (see below), the first major revolt of 1848 in German lands occurred in Vienna on 13 March 1848. The demonstrating students in Vienna had been restive and were encouraged by a sermon of Anton Füster, a liberal priest, on Sunday, 12 March 1848, in their university chapel. The student demonstrators demanded a constitution and a constituent assembly elected by universal male suffrage.

Emperor Ferdinand and his chief advisor Metternich directed troops to crush the demonstration. When demonstrators moved to the streets near the Hofburg, the troops fired on the demonstrating students, killing several of them. The new working class of Vienna joined the student demonstrations, developing an armed insurrection. The Diet of Lower Austria demanded Metternich&#x27;s resignation. With no forces rallying to Metternich&#x27;s defense, Ferdinand reluctantly complied and dismissed him. The former chancellor went into exile in London.

Ferdinand appointed new, nominally liberal, ministers. The Austrian government drafted a constitution in late April 1848. The people rejected this, as the majority was denied the right to vote. The citizens of Vienna returned to the streets from 26 May through 27, 1848, erecting barricades to prepare for an army attack. Ferdinand and his family fled to Innsbruck, where they spent the next few months surrounded by the loyal peasantry of the Tyrol. Ferdinand issued two manifestos on 16 May 1848, and 3 June 1848, which gave concessions to the people. He converted the Imperial Diet into a Constituent Assembly to be elected by the people. Other concessions were less substantial, and generally addressed the reorganizing and unification of Germany.

Ferdinand returned to Vienna from Innsbruck on 12 August 1848. Soon after his return, the working-class populace hit the streets again on 21 August to protest high unemployment and the government&#x27;s decree to reduce wages. On 23 August 1848, Austrian troops opened fire on unarmed demonstrators and shot several of them.

In late September 1848, Emperor Ferdinand, who was also King Ferdinand V of Hungary, decided to send Austrian and Croatian troops to Hungary to crush a democratic rebellion there. On 29 September 1848, the Austrian troops were defeated by the Hungarian revolutionary forces. On 6 October through 7, 1848, the citizens of Vienna had demonstrated against the emperor&#x27;s actions against forces in Hungary, resulting in the Vienna Uprising. As a result, Emperor Ferdinand I fled Vienna on 7 October 1848, taking up residence in the fortress town of Olomouc in Moravia. On 2 December 1848, Ferdinand abdicated in favour of his nephew Franz Joseph.

== Baden ==
Baden had a liberal constitution from 1811 until reaction resulted in Grand Duke Louis I revoking the constitution in 1825. In 1830, Leopold became Grand Duke. His reign brought liberal reforms in constitutional, civil and criminal law, and in education. In 1832 Baden joined the (Prussian) Customs Union. After news broke of revolutionary victories in February 1848 in Paris, uprisings occurred throughout Europe, including Austria and the German states.

Baden was the first state in Germany to have popular unrest, despite Baden being one of the most liberal states in Germany. After the news of the February Days in Paris reached Baden, there were several unorganized instances of peasants burning the mansions of local aristocrats and threatening them.

On 27 February 1848, in Mannheim, an assembly of people from Baden adopted a resolution demanding a bill of rights. Similar resolutions were adopted in Württemberg, Hesse-Darmstadt, Nassau, and other German states. The surprisingly strong popular support for these movements forced rulers to give in to many of the (demands of March) almost without resistance.

The March Revolution in Vienna was a catalyst to revolution throughout the German states. Popular demands were made for an elected representative government and for the unification of Germany. Fear on the part of the princes and rulers of the various German states caused them to concede in the demand for reform. They approved a provisional parliament, which was convened from 31 March 1848, until 4 April 1848, in St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Frankfurt am Main, charged with the task of drafting a new constitution, to be called the &quot;Fundamental Rights and Demands of the German People.&quot; The majority of the delegates to the provisional parliament were constitutional monarchists.

Baden sent two democrats, Friedrich Karl Franz Hecker and Gustav von Struve, to the provisional parliament. In the minority and frustrated with the lack of progress, Hecker and Struve walked out in protest on 2 April 1848. The walkout and the continuing revolutionary upsurge in Germany spurred the provisional parliament to action; they passed a resolution calling for an All-German National Assembly to be formed.

On 8 April 1848, a law allowing universal suffrage and an indirect (two-stage) voting system was agreed to by the assembly. A new National Assembly was selected, and on 18 May 1848, 809 delegates (585 of whom were elected) were seated at St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Frankfurt to convene the Frankfurt Parliament. Karl Mathy, a right-center journalist, was among those elected as deputy to the Frankfurt National Assembly.

Disorder fomented by republican agitators continued in Baden. Fearing greater riots, the Baden government began to increase the size of its army and to seek assistance from neighboring states. The Baden government sought to suppress the revolts by arresting Joseph Fickler, a journalist who was the leader of the Baden democrats. The arrests caused outrage and a rise in protests. A full-scale uprising broke out on 12 April 1848. The Bavarian government suppressed the revolutionary forces led by Friedrich Hecker with the aid of Prussian troops at the Battle on the Scheideck on 20 April 1848, ending what became known as the Hecker Uprising.

In May 1849, a resurgence of revolutionary activity occurred in Baden. As this was closely connected to the uprising in the Palatinate, it is described below, in the section titled, &quot;The Palatinate&quot;.

== The Palatinate ==

When the revolutionary upsurge revived in the spring of 1849, the uprisings started in Elberfeld in the Rhineland on 6 May 1849. However, the uprisings soon spread to the Grand Duchy of Baden, when a riot broke out in Karlsruhe. The state of Baden and the Palatinate (then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria) were separated only by the Rhine. The uprising in Baden and the Palatinate took place largely in the Rhine Valley along their mutual border, and are considered aspects of the same movement. In May 1849, the Grand Duke was forced to leave Karlsruhe, Baden and seek help from Prussia. Provisional governments were declared in both the Palatinate and Baden. In Baden conditions for the provisional government were ideal: the public and army were both strongly in support of constitutional change and democratic reform in the government. The army strongly supported the demands for a constitution; the state had amply supplied arsenals, and a full exchequer. The Palatinate did not have the same conditions.

The Palatinate traditionally contained more upper-class citizens than other areas of Germany, and they resisted the revolutionary changes. In the Palatinate, the army did not support the revolution, and it was not well supplied. When the insurrectionary government took over in the Palatinate, they did not find a fully organized state or a full exchequer. Arms in the Palatinate were limited to privately held muskets, rifles and sporting guns. The provisional government of the Palatinate sent agents to France and Belgium to purchase arms but they were unsuccessful. France banned sales and export of arms to either Baden or the Palatinate.
The provisional government first appointed Joseph Martin Reichard, a lawyer, democrat and deputy in the Frankfurt Assembly, as the head of the military department in the Palatinate. The first Commander in Chief of the military forces of the Palatinate was Daniel Fenner von Fenneberg, a former Austrian officer who commanded the national guard in Vienna during the 1848 uprising. He was soon replaced by Felix Raquilliet, a former Polish staff general in the Polish insurgent army of 1830–1831. Finally Ludwik Mieroslawski was given supreme command of the armed forces in the Palatinate, and Franz Sznayde was given field command of the troops.

Other noteworthy military officers serving the provisional government in the city of Kaiserslautern, were Friedrich Strasser, Alexander Schimmelpfennig, Captain Rudolph von Manteuffel, Albert Clement, Herr Zychlinski, Friedrich von Beust, Eugen Oswald, Amand Goegg, Gustav Struve, Otto Julius Bernhard von Corvin-Wiersbitzki, Joseph Moll, Johann Gottfried Kinkel, Herr Mersy, Karl Emmermann, Franz Sigel, Major Nerlinger, Colonel Kurz, Friedrich Karl, Franz Hecker and Herman von Natzmer. Hermann von Natzmer was the former Prussian officer who had been in charge of the arsenal of Berlin. Refusing to shoot insurgent forces who stormed the arsenal on 14 June 1848, Natzmer became a hero to insurgents across Germany. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison for refusing orders to shoot, but in 1849, he escaped prison and fled to the Palatinate to join its insurgent forces. Gustav Adolph Techow, a former Prussian officer, also joined Palatinate forces. Organizing the artillery and providing services in the ordnance shops was Lieutenant Colonel Freidrich Anneke. He was a member of the Communist League and one of the founders of the Cologne Workers Association in 1848, editor of the and a member of the Rhenish District Committee of Democrats.

Democrats of the Palatinate and across Germany considered the Baden-Palatinate insurrection to be part of the wider all-German struggle for constitutional rights. Franz Sigel, a second lieutenant in the Baden army, a democrat and a supporter of the provisional government, developed a plan to protect the reform movement in Karlsruhe and the Palatinate. He recommended using a corps of the Baden army to advance on the town of Hechingen and declare the Hohenzollern Republic, then to march on Stuttgart. After inciting Stuttgart and the surrounding Kingdom of Württemberg, the military corps would march to Nuremberg and set up camp in the state of Franconia. Sigel failed to account for dealing with the separate Free City of Frankfurt, the home of the Frankfurt Assembly, in order to establish an All-German character to the military campaign for the German constitution.
Despite Sigel&#x27;s plan, the new insurgent government did not go on the offensive. The uprising in Karlsruhe and the Grand Duchy of Baden was eventually suppressed by the Bavarian Army. Lorenz Peter Brentano, a lawyer and democrat from Baden, headed its government, wielding absolute power. He appointed Karl Eichfeld as War Minister. Later, Eichfeld was replaced as War Minister by Rudolph Mayerhofer. Florian Mördes was appointed as Minister of the Interior. Other members of the provisional government included Joseph Fickler, a journalist and a democrat from Baden. Leaders of the constitutional forces in Baden included Karl Blind, a journalist and a democrat in Baden; and Gustav Struve, another journalist and democrat from Baden. John Phillip Becker was placed in charge of the peoples&#x27; militia. Ludwik Mieroslawski, a Polish-born national who had taken part in the military operations during the Polish uprising of 1830–1831, was placed in charge of the military operation on the Palatinate side of the Rhine River.

Brentano ordered the day-to-day affairs of the uprising in Baden, and Mieroslawski directed a military command on the Palatinate side. They did not coordinate well. For example, Mieroslawski decided to abolish the long-standing toll on the Mannheim-Ludwigshaven bridge over the Rhine River. It was not collected on the Palatinate side, but Brentano&#x27;s government collected it on the Baden side. Due to the continued lack of coordination, Mieroslawski lost battles in Waghausle and Ubstadt in Baden. He and his troops were forced to retreat across the mountains of southern Baden, where they fought a last battle against the Prussians in the town of Murg, on the frontier between Baden and Switzerland. Mieroslawski and the other survivors of the battle escaped across the frontier to Switzerland, and the commander went into exile in Paris.

Frederick Engels took part in the uprising in Baden and the Palatinate. On 10 May 1848, he and Karl Marx traveled from Cologne, Germany, to observe the events of the region. From 1 June 1848, Engels and Marx became editors of the . Less than a year later, on 19 May 1849, the Prussian authorities closed down the newspaper because of its support for constitutional reforms.

In late 1848, Marx and Engels intended to meet with Karl Ludwig Johann D&#x27;Ester, then serving as a member of the provisional government in Baden and the Palatinate. He was a physician, democrat and socialist who had been a member of the Cologne community chapter of the Communist League. D&#x27;Ester had been elected as a deputy to the Prussian National Assembly in 1848. D&#x27;Ester had been elected to the Central committee of the German Democrats, together with Reichenbach and Hexamer, at the Second Democratic Congress held in Berlin from 26 October through 30 October 1848. Because of his commitments to the provisional government, D&#x27;Ester was unable to attend an important meeting in Paris on behalf of the German Central Committee. He wanted to provide Marx with the mandate to attend the meeting in his place. Marx and Engels met with D&#x27;Ester in the town of Kaiserslautern. Marx obtained the mandate and headed off to Paris.

Engels remained in the Palatinate, where in 1849 he joined citizens at the barricades of Elberfeld in the Rhineland, preparing to fight the Prussian troops expected to attack the uprising. On his way to Elberfeld, Engels took two cases of rifle cartridges which had been gathered by the workers of Solingen, when those workers had stormed the arsenal at Gräfrath. The Prussian troops arrived and crushed the uprising in August 1849. Engels and some others escaped to Kaiserslautern. While in Kaiserslautern on 13 June 1849, Engels joined an 800-member group of workers being formed as a military corps by August Willich, a former Prussian military officer. He was also a member of the Communist League and supported revolutionary change in Germany. The newly formed Willich Corps combined with other revolutionary groups to form an army of about 30,000 strong; it fought to resist the highly trained Prussian troops. Engels fought with the Willich Corps for their entire campaign in the Palatinate.

The Prussians defeated this revolutionary army at the Battle of Rinnthal, and the survivors of Willich&#x27;s Corps crossed over the frontier into the safety of Switzerland. Engels did not reach Switzerland until 25 July 1849. He sent word of his survival to Marx and friends and comrades in London, England. A refugee in Switzerland, Engels began to write about his experiences during the revolution. He published the article, &quot;The Campaign for the German Imperial Constitution.&quot; Due to the Prussian Army&#x27;s ease in crushing the uprising, many South German states came to believe that Prussia, not Austria, was going to be the new power in the region. The suppression of the uprising in Baden and the Palatinate was the end of the German revolutionary uprisings that had begun in the spring of 1848.

== Prussia ==

On 13 March, after warnings by the police against public demonstrations went unheeded, the army charged a group of people returning from a meeting in the Tiergarten, leaving one person dead and many injured. On 18 March, a large demonstration occurred. After two shots were fired, fearing that some of the 20,000 soldiers would be used against them, demonstrators erected barricades, and a battle ensued until troops were ordered 13 hours later to retreat, leaving hundreds dead. Afterwards, Frederick William attempted to reassure the public that he would proceed with reorganizing his government. The King also approved arming the citizens.
In his memoirs, Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee, who in March 1848 was a sixteen-year-old student at the Royal Prussian Cadet Corps, gave a vivid description of the revolutionary events in Berlin:

Those March days of 1848 left the most lasting impression on us young soldiers. From the so-called alongside the Spree we could see the erection of the barricades on the . The outbreak began at different parts of the city at two o&#x27;clock in the afternoon of the 18th, our attention being called to it by the circumstance that shots were fired at the sentinels in front of the Franz Regiment&#x27;s barracks, which adjoined those of the Cadet Corps. The report went that the Cadet Corps, that breeding place of reaction, was to be up rooted [sic]! This put our superior officers in a very awkward predicament; all connection with the outer world was cut off, and the Franz Regiment, which had been quartered next door to us, had been moved away, so we had to decide for ourselves what to do. General von Below was a feeble old man, Lieut.-Colonel Richter and our company commanders were all elderly—most of them had taken part in the War of Liberation—and some of them were no good as officers, so it was small wonder if a lack of vigour or decision was displayed. It was under debate whether we should not abstain from any attempt at resistance, when the senior lieutenant, Besserer von Dahlfingen, of my company, an exceptionally small man, spoke out at the Council of War and declared that it would be a disgrace if we surrendered to the Revolutionaries without a blow. Thereupon it was resolved to put up a fight. Our main position was to be on the first floor, led, up to by four stone staircases, each of which was allotted to a company. Our firearms, which had been placed in hiding already, were taken out again, and we began to block up the entrances to the staircases. Unfortunately we had no ammunition! This lack was in some degree made good by such officers as were sportsmen and had some powder and shot to distribute, so that firing might have been done by each of the companies; percussion-caps we secured from the Franz Regiment&#x27;s barracks. However, things were not to become serious, for a battalion of the 1st Regiment of Guards pushed forward to the Marschallbrücke and averted all possibility of danger for us. The noise of the fighting died down now a little, only to revive again in the evening. The advanced to the Alexanderplatz from the Frankfurter Gate, amidst the same kind of continuous but unsystematic fighting which the Guards also had encountered.

Early in the morning of the 19th—it may have been about 4 o&#x27;clock, the shooting had been followed by silence throughout the city—we were given the alarm and had to don our cloaks and fall in with our guns and march to the Schloss (the Royal Palace in Berlin), by order of General von Prittwitz. We set out just as day was breaking. In the Königstrasse we passed three or four deserted barricades; we could see that most of the windows in the street were broken and that all the houses showed marks of bullets.

Arrived at the Schloss, led by General von Below, himself afoot, we were ushered through &quot;Portal No. I&quot; into the Castle Yard, where General von Prittwitz was to be seen mounted on a chestnut with some officers round about him. We had now to down arms and we began almost to freeze in the cold morning air. It was very pleasant for us, therefore, when we were taken, troop by troop, into the kitchen, and given coffee. There was now a lively &quot;va-et-vient&quot; of mounted aides-de-camp, and others in the Castle Yard. The streets through which we had passed, and the open places outside the Schloss, had, of course, been empty. Now we saw many waggons [sic] and bodies of troops bivouacking. Prisoners were being brought in every now and again and taken into the Castle cellars. After a wait of two hours or so we were given orders to march back to Potsdam.

On 21 March, crowds of people gathered in Berlin to present their demands in an &quot;address to the king&quot;. King Frederick William IV, taken by surprise, verbally yielded to all the demonstrators&#x27; demands, including parliamentary elections, a constitution, and freedom of the press. He promised that &quot;Prussia was to be merged forthwith into Germany.&quot;

The next day the King proceeded through the streets of Berlin to attend a mass funeral at the Friedrichshain cemetery for the civilian victims of the uprising. He and his ministers and generals wore the revolutionary tricolor of black, red, and gold. Polish prisoners, who had been jailed for planning a rebellion in formerly Polish territories now ruled by Prussia, were liberated and paraded through the city to the acclaim of the people. The 254 persons killed during the riots were laid out on catafalques on the Gendarmenmarkt. Some 40,000 people accompanied these fallen demonstrators to their burial place at Friedrichshain.
A Constituent National Assembly was elected from various German states in late April and early May 1848 and gathered in St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Frankfurt am Main on 18 May 1848. The deputies consisted of 122 government officials, 95 judges, 81 lawyers, 103 teachers, 17 manufacturers and wholesale dealers, 15 physicians, and 40 landowners. A majority of the Assembly were liberals. It became known as the &quot;professors&#x27; parliament&quot;, as many of its members were academics in addition to their other responsibilities. The one working-class member was Polish and, like colleagues from the Tyrol, not taken seriously.

Starting on 18 May 1848, the Frankfurt Assembly worked to find ways to unite the various German states and to write a constitution. The Assembly was unable to pass resolutions and dissolved into endless debate.

On 22 May 1848, another elected assembly sat for the first time in Berlin. They were elected under the law of 8 April 1848, which allowed for universal manhood suffrage and a two-stage voting system. Most of the deputies elected to the Prussian National Assembly were members of the burghers or liberal bureaucracy. They set about the task of writing a constitution &quot;by agreement with the Crown&quot;, but on 9 November, before it had completed its work, the Assembly was adjourned and &quot;for its own safety&quot; moved to Brandenburg an der Havel.

== Saxony ==
In Dresden, the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony, the people took to the streets asking King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony to engage in electoral reform, social justice and for a constitution.

German composer Richard Wagner passionately engaged himself in the revolution in Dresden, supporting the democratic-republican movement. Later during the May Uprising in Dresden from 3–9 May 1849, he supported the provisional government. Others participating in the Uprising were the Russian revolutionary Michael Bakunin and the German working-class leader Stephen Born. In all, about 2,500 combatants manned the barricades during the May Uprising. On 9 May 1849, together with the leaders of the uprising, Wagner left Dresden for Switzerland to avoid arrest. He spent a number of years in exile abroad, in Switzerland, Italy, and Paris. Finally the government lifted its ban against him and he returned to Germany.

Since the revolutionary events of 1830, Saxony had been ruled as a constitutional monarchy with a two-chamber legislature and an accountable ministry. This constitution continued to serve as the basis of the Saxon government until 1918. The Revolution of 1848 brought more popular reforms in the government of Saxony.

In 1849, many Saxon residents emigrated to the United States, including Michael Machemehl. They landed in Galveston, Texas, and created what became the German Texan community. In mid-century, some lived in cities, but many developed substantial farms to the west in Texas.

== The Rhineland or Rhenish Prussia ==
The Rhineland shared a common history with the Rhenish Hesse, Luxembourg and the Palatinate of having been under the control of Revolutionary and then Napoleonic France from 1795. His rule established social, administrative and legislative measures that broke up the feudal rule that the clergy and the nobility had exercised over the area previously. The soil of the Rhineland is not the best for agriculture, but forestry has traditionally been a strong industry there. The relative lack of agriculture, late 18th-century elimination of the feudal structure, and the strong logging industry contributed to the industrialization of the Rhineland. With nearby sources of coal in the Mark, and access via the Rhine to the North Sea, the west bank of the Rhine in the Rhineland became the premier industrial area in Germany in the 19th century. By 1848, the towns of Aachen, Cologne and Düsseldorf were heavily industrialized, with a number of different industries represented. At the beginning of the 19th century, more than 90% of the population of the Rhineland was engaged in agriculture (including lumbering), but by 1933, only 12% were still working in agriculture

By 1848, a large industrial working class, the proletariat, had developed and, owing to Napoleonic France, the level of education was relatively high and it was politically active. While in other German states the liberal petty bourgeoisie led the uprisings of 1848, in the Rhineland the proletariat was asserting its interests openly against the bourgeoisie as early as 1840.

In 1848, Prussia controlled the Rhineland as part of &quot;Western Prussia&quot;, having first acquired territory in this area in 1614. During the Napoleonic Era, as noted above, the Rhineland west of the Rhine had been incorporated into France and its feudal structures dismantled. But, following the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, Prussia took over the west bank of the Rhineland. Its government treated the Rhinelanders as subjects and alien peoples, and it began to reinstate the hated feudal structures. Much of the revolutionary impulse in the Rhineland in 1848 was colored by a strong anti-Prussian feeling. The Rhinelanders took careful note of the announcement by King Frederick William IV on 18 March 1848, in Berlin that a United Diet would be formed and that other democratic reforms would be instituted. Elections for the United Diet were indirect. The elections were conducted on the basis of universal male suffrage, and they were to choose the members of the United Diet. Rhinelanders remained hopeful regarding this progress and did not participate in the early round of uprisings that were occurring in other parts of Germany.

The Prussian government mistook this quietude in the Rhineland for loyalty to the autocratic Prussian government. The Prussian government began offering military assistance to other states in suppressing the revolts in their territories and cities, &quot;i.e&quot;. Dresden, the Palatinate, Baden, Wűrttemberg, Franconia, &quot;etc&quot;. Soon the Prussians discovered that they needed additional troops in this effort. Taking the loyalty of the Rhineland for granted, in the spring of 1849 the Prussian government called up a large portion of the army reserve—the &quot;Landwehr&quot; in Westphalia and the Rhineland. This action was opposed: the order to call up the affected all males under the age of 40 years, and such a call up was to be done only in time of war, not in peacetime, when it was considered illegal. The Prussian King dissolved the Second Chamber of the United Diet because on 27 March 1849 it passed an unpopular constitution. The entire citizenry of the Rhineland, including the petty bourgeoisie, the grand bourgeoisie and the proletariat, rose up to protect the political reforms which they believed were slipping away.

On 9 May 1849, uprisings occurred in the Rhenish towns of Elberfeld, Düsseldorf, Iserlohn and Solingen. The uprising in Düsseldorf was suppressed the following day on 10 May 1849. In the town of Elberfeld, the uprising showed strength and persistence, as 15,000 workers took to the streets and erected barricades; they confronted the Prussian troops sent to suppress the unrest and to collect a quota of conscripts. In the end, the troops collected only about 40 conscripts from Elberfeld. A Committee of Public Safety was formed in the town, to organize the citizens in revolt. Members of the Committee included Karl Nickolaus Riotte, a democrat and a lawyer in Elberfeld; Ernst Hermann Höchster, another lawyer and democrat, elected as chairman of the Committee, and Alexis Heintzmann, a lawyer and a liberal who was also the public prosecutor in Elberfeld. Members of the Palatinate provisional government included Nikolaus Schmitt, serving as Minister of the Interior, and Theodor Ludwig Greiner. Karl Hecker, Franz Heinrich Zitz and Ludwig Blenker were among the other of the leaders of the Elberfeld uprising.

The members of the Committee for Public Safety could not agree on a common plan, let alone control the various groups taking part in the uprising. The awakened working classes were pursuing their goals with single-minded determination. Citizen-military forces (paramilitary) organized to support the uprising. Military leaders of these forces included August Willich and Feliks Trociński and Captain Christian Zinn. On 17 May through 18, 1849, a group of workers and democrats from Trier and neighboring townships stormed the arsenal at Prüm to obtain arms for the insurgents. Workers from Solingen stormed the arsenal at Gräfrath and obtained arms and cartridges for the insurgents. (As noted above under the heading on &quot;The Palatinate&quot;) Frederick Engels was active in the uprising in Elberfeld from 11 May 1849 until the end of the revolt. On 10 May 1849, he was in Solingen and making his way toward Elberfeld. He obtained two cases of cartridges from the arsenal at Gräfrath and carried them to Elberfeld.

The upper bourgeoisie were frightened by the armed working classes taking to the streets. They began to separate themselves from the movement for constitutional reform and the Committee of Public Safety, describing the leaders as bloodthirsty terrorists. Leaders of the Committee, who were mostly petty bourgeoisie, were starting to vacillate. Rather than working to organize and direct the various factions of protests, they began to draw back from the revolutionary movement, especially the destruction of property. The Committee of Public Safety tried to calm the reformist movement and quell the demonstrations.

== Bavaria ==
In Bavaria, King Ludwig I lost prestige because of his open relationship with his favourite mistress Lola Montez, a dancer and actress unacceptable to the aristocracy and the Church. She tried to launch liberal reforms through a Protestant prime minister, which outraged the state&#x27;s Catholic conservatives. On 9 February, conservatives came out onto the streets in protest. This 9 February 1848, demonstration was the first in that revolutionary year. It was an exception among the wave of liberal protests. The conservatives wanted to be rid of Lola Montez, and had no other political agenda. Liberal students took advantage of the Lola Montez affair to stress their demands for political change. All over Bavaria, students started demonstrating for constitutional reform, just as students were doing in other cities.

Ludwig tried to institute a few minor reforms but they proved insufficient to quell the storm of protests. On 16 March 1848, Ludwig I abdicated in favor of his eldest son Maximilian II. Ludwig complained that &quot;I could not rule any longer, and I did not want to give up my powers. In order to not become a slave, I became a lord.&quot; Although some popular reforms were introduced, the government regained full control.

== Liechtenstein ==

Encouraged by similar uprisings the same year, demonstrations emerged which caused increased opposition against the absolute monarchy of Aloys II. The aim of the revolution was to improve the economic and political situation of ordinary citizens in Liechtenstein, primarily fuelled by the worsening economy in the country in the years prior. On 22 March 1848, the people&#x27;s committee appointed a three-person committee to lead the Liechtenstein revolutionary movement, which included Peter Kaiser, Karl Schädler and Ludwig Grass. Together, they managed to maintain order in Liechtenstein and formed a constitutional council. Liechtenstein was a member of the National Assembly in Frankfurt until April 1849.

Following the revolution, a constitutional council was elected on 27 July 1848 in response to popular demand from the revolutionaries, of which Schädler was elected as its president. The primary task of the council was the creation the draft for a new Liechtenstein constitution, of which the work was done primarily by him and Michael Menzinger. The District Council was formed on 7 March 1849 with 24 elected representatives and acted as the first democratic representation in Liechtenstein, with Schädler was elected as District Administrator. However, after the failure of the German revolutions, Aloys II once again instated absolute power over Liechtenstein on 20 July 1852 and disbanded the district council.

== Greater Poland and Pomerelia ==

While technically neither Greater Poland nor Pomerelia were German states, the respective roughly corresponding territories of the Grand Duchy of Posen and West Prussia had been under Prussian control since the First and Second Partition of Poland in the late 18th century. The Greater Poland Uprising of 1848, also known as the Posen Uprising, was an unsuccessful military insurrection of Polish troops under Ludwik Mierosławski against the Prussian forces. It began on 20 March 1848, and resulted in Prussia demoting the Grand Duchy to an ordinary Province of Posen. Nevertheless, both Prussian-held Polish-speaking territories of Province of Posen and West Prussia were formally integrated into Germany only 17 years later, upon foundation of the North German Confederation in 1866.

== National Assembly in Frankfurt ==
In Heidelberg, in the Grand Duchy of Baden, on 6 March 1848, a group of German liberals began to make plans for an election to a German national assembly. This provisional Parliament met on 31 March, in Frankfurt&#x27;s St. Paul&#x27;s Church. Its members called for free elections to an assembly for all of Germany – and the German states agreed.

Finally, on 18 May 1848, the National Assembly opened its session in St. Paul&#x27;s Church. Of the 586 delegates of the first freely elected German parliament, so many were professors (94), teachers (30) or had a university education (233) that it was called a &quot;professors&#x27; parliament&quot; (&quot;).

There were few practical politicians. Some 400 delegates can be identified in terms of political factions – usually named after their meeting places:
* Café Milani – Right/Conservative (40)
* Casino – Right centre/Liberal-conservative (120)
* Landsberg – Centre/Liberal (40)
* Württemberger Hof – Left centre (100)
* Deutscher Hof – Left/Liberal democrats (60)
* Donnersberg – Far left/Democrats (40)
Under the chairmanship of the liberal politician Heinrich von Gagern, the assembly started on its ambitious plan to create a modern constitution as the foundation for a unified Germany.

From the beginning the main problems were regionalism, support of local issues over pan-German issues, and Austro-Prussian conflicts. Archduke John of Austria was chosen as a temporary head of state (&quot;). This was an attempt to create a provisional executive power, but it did not get very far since most states failed to fully recognize the new government. The National Assembly lost reputation in the eyes of the German public when Prussia carried through its own political intentions in the Schleswig-Holstein Question without the prior consent of Parliament. A similar discrediting occurred when Austria suppressed a popular uprising in Vienna by military force.

Nonetheless, discussions on the future constitution had started. The main questions to be decided were:
* Should the new united Germany include the German-speaking areas of Austria and thus separate these territories constitutionally from the remaining areas of the Habsburg Empire (&quot;greater German solution&quot;), or should it exclude Austria, with leadership falling to Prussia (&quot;smaller German solution&quot;)? Finally, this question was settled when the Austrian Chancellor introduced a centralised constitution for the entire Austrian Empire, thus delegates had to give up their hopes for a &quot;Greater Germany&quot;.
* Should Germany become a hereditary monarchy, have an elected monarch, or even become a republic?
* Should it be a federation of relatively independent states or have a strong central government?

Soon events began to overtake discussions. Delegate Robert Blum had been sent to Vienna by his left-wing political colleagues on a fact-finding mission to see how Austria&#x27;s government was rolling back liberal achievements by military force. Blum participated in the street fighting, was arrested and executed on 9 November, despite his claim to immunity from prosecution as a member of the National Assembly.

Although the achievements of the March Revolution were rolled back in many German states, the discussions in Frankfurt continued, increasingly losing touch with events.

In December 1848 the &quot;Basic Rights for the German People&quot; proclaimed equal rights for all citizens before the law. On 28 March 1849, the draft of the constitution was finally passed. The new Germany was to be a constitutional monarchy, and the office of head of state (&quot;Emperor of the Germans&quot;) was to be hereditary and held by the respective King of Prussia. The latter proposal was carried by a mere 290 votes in favour, with 248 abstentions. The constitution was recognized by 29 smaller states but not by Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, Hanover and Saxony.

== Backlash in Prussia ==
By late 1848, the Prussian aristocrats and generals had regained power in Berlin. They had not been defeated permanently during the incidents of March, but had only retreated temporarily. General von Wrangel led the troops who recaptured Berlin for the old powers, and King Frederick William IV of Prussia immediately rejoined the old forces. In November, the king dissolved the Prussian National Assembly and put forth a constitution of his own which was based upon the work of the Assembly yet maintained the ultimate authority of the king. Revised in 1850 and amended frequently in the following years, the constitution provided for an appointed upper house, the House of Lords, and a lower house, the House of Representatives, elected by universal manhood suffrage but under a three-class system of voting (&quot;&quot;): representation was proportional to taxes paid, so that more than 80% of the electorate controlled only one-third of the seats. Otto von Bismarck was a member of the first &quot;Landtag&quot; elected under the new constitution.

On 2 April 1849, a delegation of the National Assembly met with King Frederick William IV in Berlin and offered him the crown of the Emperor under this new constitution. Frederick William told the delegation that he felt honoured but could only accept the crown with the consent of his peers, the other sovereign monarchs and free cities. But later, in a letter to a relative in England, he wrote that he felt deeply insulted by being offered a crown &quot;from the gutter&quot;, &quot;disgraced by the stink of revolution, defiled with dirt and mud&quot;.

Austria and Prussia withdrew their delegates from the Assembly, which was now little more than a debating club. The radical members were forced to go to Stuttgart, where they sat from 6–18 June as a rump parliament until it too was dispersed by Württemberg troops. Armed uprisings in support of the constitution, especially in Saxony, the Palatinate and Baden were short-lived, as the local militaries, aided by Prussian troops, crushed them quickly. Leaders and participants, if caught, were executed or sentenced to long prison terms.

The achievements of the revolutionaries of March 1848 were reversed in all of the German states and by 1851, the Basic Rights had also been abolished nearly everywhere. In the end, the revolution fizzled because of the divisions between the various factions in Frankfurt, the calculating caution of the liberals, the failure of the left to marshal popular support and the overwhelming superiority of the monarchist forces.

Many disappointed German patriots went to the United States, among them most notably Carl Schurz, Franz Sigel and Friedrich Hecker. Such emigrants became known as the Forty-Eighters.

== Failure of the revolution ==
The Revolution of 1848 failed in its attempt to unify the German-speaking states because the Frankfurt Assembly reflected the many different interests of the German ruling classes. Its members were unable to form coalitions and push for specific goals. The first conflict arose over the goals of the assembly. The moderate liberals wanted to draft a constitution to present to the monarchs, whereas the smaller group of radical members wanted the assembly to declare itself as a law-giving parliament. They were unable to overcome this fundamental division, and did not take any definitive action toward unification or the introduction of democratic rules. The assembly declined into debate. While the French revolution drew on an existing nation state, the democratic and liberal forces in Germany of 1848 were confronted with the need to build a nation state and a constitution at the same time, which overtaxed them.

When the Frankfurt Assembly opened on 18 May 1848, the deputies elected Heinrich von Gagern as the first President of the Assembly. He had strong support from the Center-Right Unionist party and some influence with moderates of the left, such that he could control perhaps 250 of the deputies of the Frankfurt Assembly. Gagern strongly supported unification of the German states. He insisted, however, that the Assembly needed to gain agreement of the monarchs, who were highly reactionary. In addition, only the Kingdom of Prussia had the military force necessary to effect this unification. Many in the Assembly, including Gagern, distrusted the intentions of the Prussian state and its absolutist government. Fearful of losing their positions as servants of the monarchs, the moderate liberals quickly concluded that only negotiations would lead to political progress. The Prussian army ignored the demands for reforms and chased the rump assembly out of Frankfurt in 1849.

The Frankfurt Assembly had no powers to raise taxes and relied completely on the goodwill of the monarchs. As many of the members held influential provincial positions, their reluctance to call for radical reforms or annoy their employers meant that they could not raise funds for armed forces, nor enforce laws they might pass. The hundred or so radicals, who believed that an armed uprising was necessary, lost interest and left the assembly to try to raise forces at a local level to bring about a &#x27;real&#x27; revolution. Without a bureaucracy, they could not raise any money.

The Assembly members were highly motivated for reform, but the major divides among them became obvious and inhibited progress; for instance, advocates of versus advocates of , Catholics versus Protestants, supporters of Austria versus supporters of Prussia. The major conflict that caused the collapse of the Assembly was the stand-off between demands of the moderates to write a democratic constitution and liberals&#x27; reliance on negotiation with reactionary monarchs to produce reforms. The various interest groups began to gather outside the Assembly to decide on their tactics.

Meanwhile, the rulers of the German states gradually realised that their positions were no longer under threat. The King of Bavaria had stepped down, but that was only partly the result of pressure from below. As the threat of an armed uprising receded, the monarchs realized unification would not be realized. They were unwilling to give up any power in its pursuit. As princes quelled rebellions in their territories, they followed the example of Prussia, recalling their elected deputies from the Assembly. Only Prussia, with its overwhelming military might, was able to protect the Frankfurt Assembly from military attack by the princes. But Prussia had its own interests in mind.

The Frankfurt National Assembly did agree to found the Reichsflotte, the German Navy, on 14 June 1848, which was significant to Germany&#x27;s future power and reach.

The powerlessness of the Frankfurt Assembly, however, was reflected in the debate over the Danish Conflict of 1848. Like many other events of 1848, the Danish conflict was sparked by a street demonstration. On 21 March 1848, the people of Copenhagen protested in the streets to demand a liberal Constitution. The majority in the Duchy of Holstein and in the southern part of the Duchy of Schleswig were German-speaking. However, the Duke of both duchies was King Frederick VII of Denmark, the last absolute monarch of Denmark. The citizens of Kiel and Holstein were unsure of what was occurring in Copenhagen. They revolted to found a separate and autonomous province with closer relations with the German states. On 24 March 1848, they set up a new provisional, autonomous government in Holstein and raised a Schleswig-Holstein army of 7,000 soldiers. Unification opinion in the German states supported annexing the provinces of Schleswig and Holstein.

Prussia sent an army to support this independence movement, and ignored the Frankfurt National Assembly when Great Britain and Russia applied international pressure to end the war. The Prussians signed a peace at Malmö, requiring them to remove all Prussian troops from the two duchies and agree to all other Danish demands. The Armistice of Malmö was greeted with great consternation in Germany, and debated in the Assembly, but it was powerless to control Prussia. On 16 September 1848, the Frankfurt National Assembly approved of the Malmö Treaty by a majority vote. Public support for the National Assembly declined sharply following this vote, and the radical republicans publicly stated their opposition to the Assembly.

The Frankfurt National Assembly had been founded partly following the revolutionary events in Vienna, Austria, which resulted in the fall of Prince Metternich. Its strongest support came from the southern provinces, where there was a tradition of opposition to the local rulers. After Austria crushed the Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states, the Habsburgs were ready to deal with the German states. Unable to muster an army and lacking broader support, the Assembly could not resist Austrian power. The Frankfurt National Assembly was dissolved on 31 May 1849.

== Peasant success of the revolution ==
Nationalism did not become the usual way of founding and legitimising states across Europe until after World War I. In the mid-19th century, over 90% of the population in the Austrian Empire and the German Confederation were peasants. Most of them suffered the indignity of serfdom or some lingering elements of the system of forced labor. Peasant revolts in 1848–1849 involved more participants than the national revolutions of the period. Most importantly, they were successful in bringing the final abolition of serfdom or its remnants across the German Confederation, the Austrian Empire and Prussia. The leader of the anti-serfdom peasant movement was Hans Kudlich, subsequently revered as (&#x27;liberator of peasants&#x27;).

== In popular culture ==
* The second half of Max Ophüls&#x27; 1955 film &quot;Lola Montès&quot; lavishly depicts the famous courtesan&#x27;s affair with Bavarian King Ludwig I, and his eventual downfall in the 1848 uprisings.

<text>The Fat of the Land is the third studio album by English rock band The Prodigy, released on 30 June 1997 through XL Recordings. The album received critical acclaim and topped the UK Albums Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. it has sold over 10 million copies worldwide, and is their best-selling album that they have ever made.

==Background, artwork and album title==
While Liam Howlett is generally responsible for the compositions and Maxim Reality is featured on two tracks, this is the first record to include contributions by Keith Flint. &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; album cover featured an image of a moon crab and a new logo, dropping &quot;The&quot; and adding an ant silhouette. The album title comes from the old English phrase &#x27;living off the fat of the land&#x27;, which means living well or being wealthy.

== Release ==
Released in the first week of July, the album hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart on 19 July 1997. Certified double platinum on 2 December that year, it sold 2,600,000 copies in the United States.

In 1999, &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; entered the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the fastest-selling dance album in the UK. The album was also nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards, but lost to Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;OK Computer&quot;.

===Controversy===
The National Organization for Women objected to the seeming misogyny of &quot;Smack My Bitch Up&quot;, though the band maintains that its true interpretation is &quot;doing anything intensely&quot;. Liam Howlett observed, &quot;That record was for the fans. Only brainless people get some stupid message out of it… I&#x27;m often misquoted. Some magazine said, &#x27;Liam Howlett says his band are dangerous.&#x27; What I said was, &#x27;For this band to survive, it has to be dangerous for us&#x27;… I wasn&#x27;t saying we were dangerous because we&#x27;re firestarters and we have spiky hair.&quot;

== Reception ==

The album has been featured in a number of music publication lists:

* In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; readers voted &quot;The Fat of the Land&quot; the ninth greatest album of all time. In 2000, &quot;Q&quot; placed it at number 47 in its list of the 100 greatest British albums ever. It has also been ranked number 43 in &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Best 50 Albums of &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s Lifetime&quot; list, and was included in their &quot;90 Best Albums of the 1990s&quot; and &quot;50 Best Albums of 1997&quot; lists.
*&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it in their &quot;Essential Recordings of the 90s&quot; list.
* &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it number 20 on their list of the &quot;Top 20 Albums of the Year [1997]&quot; list.
* &quot;Melody Maker&quot; ranked it number 13 on their list of &quot;Albums of the Year&quot; for 1997 and number 29 in their 1997 Pazz &amp; Jop Critics&#x27; Poll.
* &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 17 in their 1997 Critics&#x27; Poll.
* In 2000 it was voted number 269 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.
* Heavy metal-focused magazine &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; included it in their 2020 list of the top 10 1997 albums, citing it as &quot;the point at which rave culture collided with metal culture&quot;.

The album is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and was nominated for the 1997 Mercury Music Prize.

Following Flint&#x27;s death on 4 March 2019, fans used the hashtag &#x27;Firestarter4Number1&#x27; on various social media platforms to replicate the song&#x27;s success by getting it to the number one spot again; which was done out of respect for Keith Flint and to raise awareness of suicide among men. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Firestarter&quot; returned to the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, entering number 13 on its Dance/Electronic Digital Song Sales chart in its 26 March 2019 issue, marking the first time that this song has appeared on a dance chart of any kind.

<doc id="274050" wikidata="Q1400365" url="?curid=274050" title="Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states">
<text>The 1848 Revolutions in the Italian states, part of the wider Revolutions of 1848 in Europe, were organized revolts in the states of the Italian peninsula and Sicily, led by intellectuals and agitators who desired a liberal government. As Italian nationalists they sought to eliminate reactionary Austrian control. During this time, Italy was not a unified country, and was divided into many states, which, in Northern Italy, were ruled directly or indirectly by the Austrian Empire. A desire to be independent from foreign rule, and the conservative leadership of the Austrians, led Italian revolutionaries to stage revolution in order to drive out the Austrians. The revolution was led by the state of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Some uprisings in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, particularly in Milan, forced the Austrian General Radetzky to retreat to the Quadrilateral fortresses.

King Charles Albert, who ruled Piedmont-Sardinia from 1831 to 1849, aspired to unite Italy with the endorsement of Pope Pius IX, head of the Papal States, which comprised a large territory in the center of the Italian peninsula. He declared war on Austria in March 1848 and launched a full-out attack on the Quadrilateral. Lacking allies, Charles Albert was no match for the Austrian army and was defeated at the Battle of Custoza on 24 July 1848. He signed a truce and withdrew his forces from Lombardy, and thus Austria remained dominant in a divided Italy until the Second Italian War of Independence.

== The rebellion ==

After witnessing the liberal friendly events that were occurring in Rome, the people of other states started to demand similar treatment. It commenced on 12 January in Sicily, where the people began to demand a Provisional Government, separate from the government of the mainland. King Ferdinand II tried to resist these changes; however, a full-fledged revolt erupted in Sicily and a revolt also erupted in Salerno and Naples. These revolts drove Ferdinand and his army out of Sicily, and forced him to allow a provisional government to be constituted. During those months, the constitution was quite advanced for its time in liberal democratic terms, as was the proposal of a unified Italian confederation of states. The revolt&#x27;s failure was reversed 12 years later as the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies collapsed in 1860–61 with the unification of Italy.

On 11 February 1848, Leopold II of Tuscany, first cousin of Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria, granted the Constitution, with the general approval of his subjects. The Habsburg example was followed by Charles Albert of Sardinia (Albertine Statute; later became the constitution of the unified Kingdom of Italy and remained in force, with changes, until 1948) and by Pope Pius IX (Fundamental Statute). However, only King Charles Albert maintained the statute even after the end of the riots.

Notwithstanding the events in Rome and Naples, the states still were under a conservative rule. Italians in Lombardy-Venetia could not enjoy these freedoms. The Austrian Empire of this region had tightened their grip on the people by further oppressing them with harsher taxes. Tax gatherers were sent out along with the 100,000 man army standing in place, and letting their presence be known. 
These revolts in Sicily helped to spark revolts in the northern Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia. Revolutions in the Lombard city of Milan, which marked the beginning of the First Italian War of Independence, forced about 20,000 of Austrian General Radetsky&#x27;s troops to withdraw from the city. Eventually General Radetsky was forced to completely withdraw his troops from the two states, however, with his expertise, he was able to keep the Quadrilateral fortresses of Verona, Peschiera, Legnago and Mantua. Through his skillful tactics he brought his men that had been withdrawn into the key forts. Meanwhile, the Italian insurgents were encouraged when news of Prince Metternich&#x27;s resignation in Vienna spread, but were unable to completely eject Radetsky&#x27;s troops. 

In the Quadrilateral General Radetsky and his men were plotting a counterattack in order to regain their lost ground. However, they were interrupted by Charles Albert, who had by then taken the forefront of the attack, and had launched an attack against the Quadrilateral. Charles Albert charged the fortress from all sides aided by 25,000 reinforcements, who came in assistance of the nationalist cause. While journeying to the fortress preparing for the attack, Charles Albert garnered the support of princes of other states. His fellow princes responded by sending reinforcements to his aid: Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany sent 8,000, Pope Pius contributed 10,000, and Ferdinand II sent 16,050 men on the advice of general Guglielmo Pepe. They attacked the fortresses and on 3 May 1848 succeeded in winning the Battle of Goito and capturing the fortress of Peschiera.

At that point, Pope Pius IX became nervous about defeating the Austrian Empire and withdrew his troops, citing that he could not endorse a war between two Catholic nations. King Ferdinand of the Two Sicilies also called his soldiers back. However, some of them did not comply with the order and continued on under the guidance of Generals Pepe, Durando and Giovanni until defeat at the Battle of Custoza. An armistice was agreed to, and Radetzky regained control of all of Lombardy–Venetia save Venice itself, where the Republic of San Marco was proclaimed under Daniele Manin. A year later, Charles Albert launched another attack, but, due to the lack of troops, he was defeated in the Battle of Novara.

In the Duchy of Modena and Reggio, Duke Francis V attempted to respond militarily to the first attempts at armed revolt, but faced with the approach of Bolognese volunteers to support the insurgents, in order to avoid bloodshed he preferred to leave the city promising a constitution and amnesties. On 21 March 1848 he left for Bolzano. A provisional government was established in Modena. The municipalities of Menton and Roquebrune, at the time part of the Principality of Monaco, united and obtained independence as the Free Cities of Menton and Roquebrune.

== Aftermath ==
Despite the fact that Pius had abandoned the war against the Austrians, many of his people had still fought alongside Charles Albert. The people of Rome rebelled against Pius&#x27; government and assassinated Pellegrino Rossi, Pius&#x27; minister. Pope Pius IX then fled to the fortress of Gaeta, under the protection of King Ferdinand II. In February 1849, he was joined by Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany, fleeing the radical democrats who set up the short-lived Tuscan Republic (1849). Piedmont was also defeated by the Austrians in 1849 and Charles Albert had to abdicate leaving his son, Victor Emmanuel II, to rule.

In Rome, the authority that did take over passed popular legislation to eliminate burdensome taxes and give work to the unemployed. Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini came to build a &quot;Rome of the People,&quot; and the short-lived &quot;Roman Republic&quot; was proclaimed. The republic aimed to inspire the people to build an independent Italian nation. It also attempted to improve economically the lives of the underserved by giving some of the Church&#x27;s large landholdings to poor peasants. It also made prison and insane asylum reforms, gave freedom to the press, provided secular education, but shied away from the &quot;Right to Work&quot;, having seen this fail in France.

However, the many reforms instituted by the new Republic combined with its lowering of taxes brought about monetary problems which the republic then compounded by simply printing more money. Runaway price inflation doomed the economy of the republic. In addition sending troops to defend Piedmont from Austrian forces put Rome at risk of attack from Austria. Moreover, Pope Pius appealed to Louis Napoleon for help in restoring his temporal power. The French President saw this as an opportunity to gain Catholic support. The French army arrived by sea under the command of General Charles Oudinot, and, despite an early loss to Garibaldi, the French, with the help of the Austrians, eventually defeated the Roman Republic. On July 12, 1849 Pope Pius IX was escorted back into Rome and ruled under French protection until 1870.

==Riots and the Italian tricolour==

The Italian tricolour flag was a symbol of the revolutions of 1848. In March 1848, the Five Days of Milan, an armed insurrection which led to the temporary liberation of the city from Austrian rule, were characterised by a profusion of flags and Italian tricolour cockades. On 20 March, during furious fighting, with the Austrians barricaded in the Castello Sforzesco and within the defensive systems of the city walls, the patriots Luigi Torelli and Scipione Bagaggia managed to climb on the roof of the Milan Cathedral and hoist the Italian flag on the highest spire of the church, the one on which the &quot;Madonnina&quot; stands. At the moment of the appearance of the Italian tricolour on the spire of the &quot;Madonnina&quot;, the crowd below greeted the event with a series of enthusiastic &quot;Hurray!&quot; This historic flag is kept inside the Museum of the Risorgimento in Milan. The patriot Luciano Manara then managed to hoist the Italian tricolour, amidst the Austrian artillery shots, on the top of Porta Tosa. The abandonment of the city by the Austrian troops of field marshal Josef Radetzky, on 22 March, determined the immediate establishment of the provisional government of Milan chaired by the podestà Gabrio Casati, who issued a proclamation that read:

The process of transforming the flag of Italy into one of the Italian national symbols was completed, definitively consolidating itself, during the Milanese uprisings.
The following day King Charles Albert of Piedmont-Sardinia assured the provisional government of Milan that his troops, ready to come to his aid by starting the First Italian War of Independence, would use an Italian tricolour defaced with the Savoyan coat of arms superimposed on the white as a war flag. In his proclamation to the Lombard–Venetian people, Charles Albert said:

As the arms, blazoned &quot;gules a cross argent&quot;, mixed with the white of the flag, it was &quot;fimbriated azure&quot;, blue being the dynastic colour, although this does not conform to the heraldic rule of tincture. The rectangular civil and state variants were adopted in 1851.

A makeshift Italian tricolour consisting of redshirts, green displays and a white sheet was hoisted on the flagpole of the ship that brought Giuseppe Garibaldi back to Italy from South America shortly after the outbreak of the First Italian War of Independence. The patriots who had gathered at the port of Genoa to welcome her return gave Anita Garibaldi, in front of 3,000 people, an Italian tricolour to be given to Giuseppe Garibaldi so that he could plant it on Lombard soil.

The Grand Duchy of Tuscany in the act of granting the constitution (17 February 1848) did not change the national banner (&quot;The State retains its flag and its colours&quot;) but later granted the Tuscan militias, by decree, the use of an Italian tricolour scarf next to the symbols of the Grand Duchy (25 March 1848). The Grand Duke, following the pressure of the Tuscan patriots, then adopted the Italian tricolour flag also as a state banner and as a military banner for the troops sent to help Charles Albert of Piedmont-Sardinia. Similar measures were adopted by the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza and by the Duchy of Modena and Reggio.
The flag of the Constitutional Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, a white field charged with the coats of arms of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Two Sicilies, and Granada, was modified by Ferdinand II through the addition of a red and green border. This flag lasted from 3 April 1848 until 19 May 1849. The Provisional Government of Sicily, which lasted from 12 January 1848 to 15 May 1849 during the Sicilian Revolution, adopted the Italian tricolour, defaced with the trinacria, or triskelion.

The Republic of San Marco, proclaimed independent in 1848 by the Austrian Empire, also adopted the Italian tricolour. The flags that they adopted marked the link to Italian independence and unification efforts. The former, the Italian tricolour undefaced, and the latter, charged with the winged lion of St. Mark, from the flag of the Republic of Venice (maritime republic which existed from 697 AD until 1797 AD), on a white canton. A chronicler of the time described the final moments of the subsequent capitulation of the Republic of San Marco by the Austrian troops, which took place on 22 August 1849:

The Italian tricolour flag of 1848 that greeted the expulsion of the Austrians from Venice is kept in the Museum of the Risorgimento and the Venetian 19th century.
In 1849, the Roman Republic, formed following the revolt against the Papal State that dethroned the Pope, adopted as its national banner a green, white and red flag with a republican Roman eagle at the tip of the pole. This lasted for four months, while the Papal States of the Church was in abeyance. The Roman Republic resisted until 4 July 1849, when it was capitulated by the French Army. The troops from beyond the Alps, as a last act, entered the municipality of Rome where the last members of the republican assembly not yet captured were barricaded. Their secretary Quirico Filopanti surrendered wearing an Italian tricolour scarf.

The Italian tricolour also flew over the barricades of the Ten Days of Brescia, a revolt of the citizens of the Lombard city against the Austrian Empire, and in many other centres such as Varese, Gallarate, Como, Melegnano, Cremona, Monza, Udine, Trento, Verona, Rovigo, Vicenza, Belluno and Padua. This spread throughout the Italian peninsula and demonstrated that the Italian tricolour flag had by then assumed a consolidated symbolism valid throughout the national territory. The iconography of the Italian flag then began to spread not only in the vexillological and military fields, but also in some everyday objects such as scarves and clothing fabrics.

<text>The Serbian Tricolour Hound () is a breed of scent hound from Serbia. 

==History==
The Serbian Tricolour Hound, like the closely related Serbian Hound, Montenegrin Mountain Hound, Posavac Hound, Istrian Shorthaired Hound, Istrian Coarse-haired Hound and Barak Hound, is believed to have descended from hounds traded by Mediterranean seafarers through ports on the Adriatic coast. All scent hounds, these breeds are believed to also have some early sighthound blood in their ancestry.

According to Serbia&#x27;s national kennel club the Kinološki Savez Srbije, the Serbian Tricolour Hound was initially considered a variety of the Serbian Hound, but in 1946 a separate breed standard was drawn up and it was granted separate recognition. The breed was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1961. Originally called the Yugoslavian Tricolour Hound, the breed&#x27;s name was changed after the breakup of Yugoslavia.

Rarely seen outside of its homeland, the Serbian Tricolour Hound is considered extremely rare and at possible risk of extinction.

Healthy adult Serbian Hounds typically weigh between . Their bodies are slightly longer than they are tall, they have long legs and good bone.

The breed&#x27;s coat is short, thick, glossy and course to touch, it provides the breed with good protection from the elements; in colour they are predominantly black and fawn with a white around the neck, on the chest on their extremities and a blaze on the face.

===Character===

<text>Karl Goldmark (born Károly Goldmark, Keszthely, 18 May 1830 – Vienna, 2 January 1915) was a Hungarian-born Viennese composer.

==Life and career==

Goldmark came from a large Jewish family. His father, Ruben Goldmark, was a chazan (cantor) to the Jewish congregation at Keszthely, Hungary, where Karl was born. Karl Goldmark&#x27;s older brother Joseph became a physician and was later involved in the Revolution of 1848, and forced to emigrate to the United States. Karl Goldmark&#x27;s early training as a violinist was at the musical academy of Sopron (1842–44).

He continued his music studies there and two years later was sent by his father to Vienna, where he was able to study for some eighteen months with Leopold Jansa before his money ran out. He prepared himself for entry first to the Vienna &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot; and then to the Vienna Conservatory to study the violin with Joseph Böhm and harmony with Gottfried Preyer.
Until he became a member of Vienna&#x27;s Carl Theatre in 1850, Goldmark was impoverished, surviving on menial odd jobs and handouts. [Douglas Townsend, liner notes to Columbia Records MS7261, Rustic Wedding (Leonard Berstein, NY Philharmonic)]
The Revolution of 1848 forced the Conservatory to close down. Goldmark was largely self-taught as a composer, and he supported himself in Vienna playing the violin in theatre orchestras, at the Carlstheater and the privately supported Viennese institution, the Theater in der Josefstadt. This gave him practical experience with orchestration, an art he more than mastered. He also gave lessons: Jean Sibelius studied with him briefly. Goldmark&#x27;s first concert in Vienna (1858) met with hostility, and he returned to Budapest, returning to Vienna in 1860.

To make ends meet, Goldmark also pursued a side career as a music journalist. &quot;His writing is distinctive for his even-handed promotion of both Brahms and Wagner, at a time when audiences (and most critics) were solidly in one composer&#x27;s camp or the other and viewed those on the opposing side with undisguised hostility.&quot; (Liebermann 1997) Johannes Brahms and Goldmark developed a friendship as Goldmark&#x27;s prominence in Vienna grew. Goldmark, however, ultimately distanced himself because of Brahms&#x27; prickly personality.

Among the musical influences Goldmark absorbed was the inescapable one, for a musical colorist, of Richard Wagner, whose anti-semitism stood in the way of any genuine warmth between them; in 1872 Goldmark took a prominent role in the formation of the Vienna Wagner Society. He was made an honorary member of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Budapest and shared with Richard Strauss an honorary membership in the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, Rome.

Goldmark&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Königin von Saba&quot; (&quot;The Queen of Sheba&quot;), Op. 27 was celebrated during his lifetime and for some years thereafter. First performed in Vienna on 10 March 1875, the work proved so popular that it remained in the repertoire of the Vienna Staatsoper continuously until 1938. He wrote six other operas as well (see list).

The &quot;Rustic Wedding Symphony&quot; (&quot;Ländliche Hochzeit&quot;), Op. 26 (first performed in 1876), a work that was kept in the repertory by Sir Thomas Beecham, includes five movements, like a suite composed of coloristic tone poems: a wedding march with variations depicting the wedding guests, a nuptial song, a serenade, a dialogue between the bride and groom in a garden, and a dance movement.

His Violin Concerto No. 1 in A minor, Op. 28, was once his most frequently played piece. The concerto had its première in Bremen in 1877, initially enjoyed great popularity and then slid into obscurity. A very romantic work, it has a Magyar march in the first movement and passages reminiscent of Dvořák and Mendelssohn in the second and third movements. The concerto has started to re-enter the repertoire with recordings by such prominent violin soloists as Itzhak Perlman and Joshua Bell. Nathan Milstein also championed the work. Milstein&#x27;s recording of the Concerto (1957) is widely considered the definitive one. 

He wrote a second violin concerto, but it was never published. A second symphony in E-flat, Op. 35, is much less well known. Goldmark also wrote an early symphony in C major, between roughly 1858 and 1860. That work was never given an opus number and only the scherzo seems to have ever been published.
Goldmark&#x27;s chamber music, in which the influences of Schumann and Mendelssohn are paramount, although critically well received in his lifetime, is now rarely heard. It includes the String Quintet in A minor Op. 9 that made his first reputation in Vienna, the Violin Sonata in D major Op. 25, two Piano Quintets in B-flat major, Op. 30 and C-sharp minor, Op. 54, the Cello Sonata Op. 39, and the work that first brought Goldmark&#x27;s name into prominence in the Viennese musical world, the String Quartet in B-flat Op. 8 (his only work in that genre). He also composed choral music, two Suites for Violin and Piano (in D major, Op. 11, and in E-flat major, Op. 43), and numerous concert overtures, such as the &quot;Sakuntala&quot; Overture Op. 13 (a work which cemented his fame after his String Quartet), the &quot;Penthesilea&quot; Overture Op. 31, the &quot;In the Spring&quot; Overture Op. 36, the &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; Overture Op. 38, the &quot;Sappho&quot; Overture Op. 44, the &quot;In Italy&quot; Overture Op. 49, and the &quot;Aus Jugendtagen&quot; Overture, Op. 53. Other orchestral works include the symphonic poem &quot;Zrínyi&quot;, Op. 47, and two orchestral scherzos, in E minor, Op. 19, and in A major, Op. 45.

Goldmark&#x27;s nephew Rubin Goldmark (1872–1936), a pupil of Dvořák, was also a composer, who spent his career in New York.

==Death==

Goldmark died in Vienna and is buried in the Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery), along with many other notable composers. Many of his autograph manuscripts are in the collection of the National Széchényi Library, with &quot;G&quot; catalogue numbers attached to various works (including those without opus number.)

<text>The Montenegrin Mountain Hound () is a rare dog breed originating from the mountainous regions of Montenegro. Black and tan, with a smooth coat, the Montenegrin Mountain Hound was called &quot;Black Hound&quot; in the past. The breed is of the same origin as the other Balkan hounds. It stands high and weighs . The breed is used to hunt fox, hare, and small game, occasionally hunting larger animals such as deer or even wild boar.

The breed was formerly known as the Yugoslavian Mountain Hound (); the FCI changed the name on July 15, 1997. The first standard dates back to 1924. The breed bears strong resemblance to the Austrian Black and Tan Hound. The breed was first officially recognized on May 8, 1969, in Warsaw. American Rare Breed Association considers the breed endangered.

Perhaps the most memorable popular depiction of the Montenegrin Mountain Hound (then called Yugoslavian Mountain Hound) had been as the hand puppet &quot;Triumph the Insult Comic Dog&quot;, regularly appearing on the NBC television show &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Although the puppet displays physical characteristics of the breed, and was identified as such during many appearances, the caption identifying Triumph as a Yugoslavian Mountain Hound was promptly removed after NATO military attack ensued against FR Yugoslavia.

<text>Keijō Imperial University was an Imperial University in Keijō (Seoul), Korea, Empire of Japan that existed between 1924 and 1946.

The university was seen as the preeminent educational institution in colonial Korea. Upon the 1945 liberation of Korea, it was briefly renamed Kyŏngsŏng University, was seized by the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) in 1946, and reorganized into its successor: the present Seoul National University.

==History==
In 1923, an organization called the Korea Private University Foundation Committee () was formed. Its founding leader was . In response to their activism, the Japanese Government-General of Chōsen agreed to a proposal () to found a university in Korea.Keijō Imperial University was founded in 1924. For the first two years, students were enrolled only in the preparatory education division (予科), which was similar to the Higher Schools in mainland Japan, except it was a year shorter and included Japanese language instruction for Korean students, as most faculty members were Japanese. When the first group of students completed their preparatory education in 1926, three-year programs for law and literature were introduced, along with a four-year medical program.

They began gradually adding new programs over time, based on what was deemed important for colonial Korea. An article in the &quot;Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&quot; argues that science and engineering programs were deliberately not introduced until around Japan&#x27;s entry into World War II. The article argues this was because Japan wanted to avoid disseminating technical and scientific knowledge to Koreans. Research activities were limited, and there were maximum quotas for how many Koreans were allowed to be admitted. An alumnus of the university testified in 2010 that bureaucrats were held in much higher esteem than engineers and scientists in colonial Korea, which led to the law program becoming excessively popular.

In 1928, a hospital affiliated with the university finished construction. In April 1929, it graduated its first class of 90 law and literature students, 22 of whom were ethnic Koreans. In 1930, it graduated its first class of 55 medical students, with 12 Koreans. In March 1934, it extended the liberal arts program to three years. In 1938, it established a science and engineering department, and increased the class sizes for that program in 1941.

After the liberation of Korea, Keijō Imperial University was renamed to &quot;Gyeongseong University&quot; (). After the war, it was no longer considered a Japanese university, and it was closed by the USAMGIK on August 22, 1946, under US Military Ordinance No. 102. While speaking to Korean officials, the U.S. Military Governor stated that the U.S. &quot;gave a basic law enacted which will place our national university on a level equal to the best in the world.&quot;

The remaining properties of Keijo University merged with Gyeongseong Industrial School, Gyeongseong Mine School, Gyeongseong Medical School, Suwon Agriculture School, Gyeongseong Economics School, Gyeongseong Dental Medicine School, Gyeongseong Normal School and Gyeongseong Women&#x27;s Normal School into Seoul National University. Additionally, Seoul National University College of Medicine was established in 1946 through the merger of Keijō Medical School and Keijō Imperial University.

== Activities ==
Keijō Imperial University published original articles and abstracts in journals including Shinkeigaku-zassi (Neurologia), Seishin-shinkei-gaku zassi (Psychiatria Et Neurologia Japonica), and The Journal of Chosun. 

The Keijō Imperial University research team organised and conducted field studies on sampling of blood typing, as well as physical anthropology research from people representative of the Korean peninsula. The gathering of men and women by local police and administrative power had been conducted as measuring them was necessary for the progression of Keijō Imperial University&#x27;s physical anthropology research. In 1937, Keijō Imperial University extended its research of physical anthropology field studies to Manchuria and China. Keijō Imperial University&#x27;s field studies in Korea, Manchuria and China were financially supported by the Japanese government and research foundations.

Controversies surrounding Keijō Imperial University&#x27;s research of physical anthropology and blood typing is related to the use of a racial index [R.I. (= A%+AB%/B%+AB%)]. Professor Ock Joo Kim of Seoul National University states “the Japanese researchers put Koreans as a race between the Mongolian and the Japanese. The preoccupation with constitution and race also pervasively affected the medical practice: race (Japanese, Korean, or Japanese living in Korea) must be written in every kind of medical chart as a default”.

==Faculties and divisions==
=== Law and literature ===
* The division of law and literature encapsulated studies belonging to law, literature, history and philosophy.
* At Keijō Imperial University, students had the opportunity to publish their literary works. In a preparatory literature course, students published in the magazine titled &#x27;Seiryo&#x27;. In a regular course, students had the publish their literary works in the magazine titled &#x27;Jōdai Bungaku&#x27;.
* Western History Education at Keijō Imperial University was offered as a study at the university.

=== Medicine ===
* Seoul National University College of Medicine was established in 1946 after the abolishment of Keijō Imperial University by the merger of Keijō Medical School and Keijō Imperial University. The first class graduated in 1947.
* The Governor-General of Korea&#x27;s Office Hospital was developed into a hospital attached to the faculty of medicine at Keijō Imperial University in 1928. The hospital had a psychiatry ward which was the only psychiatric institution in Korea at the time. Results shared by Keijō Imperial University psychiatrics Kubo Kiyoji and Hattori Rokuro, the psychiatric ward had admitted 576 Japanese patients, and 508 Korean patients from its establishment to 1930. 
* Keijō Imperial University only had about 40 beds for psychiatric patients in 1928.
* Keijō Imperial University was under the jurisdiction of the Governor-General. As there was not enough funding for both Keijō Imperial University&#x27;s medical department alongside the Governor-General of Korea Hospital, therefore, staff from the Governor-General&#x27;s Hospital were transferred to Keijō Imperial University&#x27;s medical department. At the Keijō Medical Professional School, professors, assistant professors and assistants lectured in Mental Science. The hospital connected to the university was expanded to have 222 beds with a total of 35 physicians, with staff including directors, medical officers as well as professors. Keijō Imperial University&#x27;s medical department contributed towards the Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology up until 1945 by members of the medical department and professors of psychiatry. Studies at Keijō Imperial University included publications on insanity, symptomatic psychosis, sleep disorder, epidemiology, alcohol and morphine addiction, and schizophrenia. 
* Keijō Imperial University was the only institution in Korea to have psychiatric beds until 1931 when a psychiatric was established within the Severance Union Medical School Hospital.
* Twenty-nine research papers and abstracts on psychiatric treatments were presented and reviewed at Keijō Imperial University. Major research areas included biological psychiatry and biological treatment. During this time, Japanese psychiatrists had introduced German psychiatry into Japan and Keijō Imperial University. Professors who contributed towards this research included Professor Kubo, Dr. Hattori, Dr. Hikari and Professor Suits. Malarial fever therapy, as well as sulphur-induced fever therapy and insulin shock treatment were frequent research topics at Keijō Imperial University. Six more papers on psychotherapy were published at the university, two being on persuasion therapy, three being case reports on psychoanalytic therapy, and one paper being on Sigmund Freud. Psychoanalytical therapy research has shown evidence that there had been limited triads conducted in the follow-up of literal guidance, where further development was not noted. 
* Keijō Imperial University also conducted studies relating to pharmacology, psychology, pathology and parasitology. Amongst these, topics for medical research included the research into control of infectious diseases, hygiene and environmental health for Japanese and Koreans.

=== Engineering and natural science ===
* This faculty or division was established in 1938 before the outbreak of World War II.

==Statistics==
=== 1930s ===
For Korean individuals, admission into Keijō Imperial University was a very competitive process as the admission of Korean students was restricted to between one-fourth and one-third of the total number of enrolled students at Keijō Imperial University. By 1930, six years after Keijō University was established, the number of enrolled students was at 520. This was equivalent to 6.7 percent of the number of students enrolled at Tokyo Imperial University. Japanese students made up the majority of the students enrolled. Amongst two thousand graduates during the colonial period, the number of Korean graduates was at seven hundred, the other thirteen hundred being Japanese.
In 1934, the total enrolment of the Keijō Imperial University was 930 students. The percentage of Korean students which made up this number was of 32%. Although the Korean percentage rose in the coming years, namely in 1942 where the percentage of Korean students was at 39%.

=== 1940s ===
In 1943, Keijō Imperial University had 67 professors and 203 students who were Japanese. Three professors and 170 students were Korean.

=== Graduate statistics ===
150 students received a doctor of medicine degree from Keijō Imperial University.

<doc id="274064" wikidata="Q7943224" url="?curid=274064" title="Vs. (Mission of Burma album)">
<text>Vs. is the debut studio album by American post-punk band Mission of Burma, following their 1981 EP, &quot;Signals, Calls, and Marches&quot;. It was released in October 1982 by record label Ace of Hearts. It is the only full-length studio album the band released during the 1980s – and until 2004, as soon afterward they disbanded due to guitarist Roger Miller&#x27;s worsening tinnitus.

==Recording and content==
Whereas 1981&#x27;s &quot;Signals, Calls, and Marches&quot; was notable for its accessible and organized qualities&quot;, Vs.&quot; saw Mission of Burma make a deliberate effort to record the chaos and noise that characterized their live performances. To help capture their live sound, the album was recorded in a large room at Normandy Sound studios in Rhode Island.

The songs on the album feature a greater presence of band member Martin Swope&#x27;s electronic and tape sound effects than with the band&#x27;s previous recordings.

Mission of Burma guitarist Roger Miller considered &quot;Vs.&quot; to be the band&#x27;s best recording, and among the greatest rock and roll albums ever made.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Vs.&quot; has been well received by critics, immediately receiving positive reviews from publications like &quot;The New York Times.&quot; In a pre-release review of the track &quot;Trem Two,&quot; &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; said &quot;it sounds like the creation, destruction, and rebirth of the universe in four minutes.&quot; Despite strong reviews, the noisier sound caused the album to be considered less appropriate for radio airplay than previous Mission of Burma recordings. Robert Christgau, who originally gave it a &quot;B+&quot; in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, later said he should have graded it an &quot;A−&quot;.

In his retrospective review, Mark Deming of AllMusic opined that &quot;Vs.&quot; saw Mission of Burma &quot;[mature] into a band whose sound was as distinctive as anyone of its generation. [...] It&#x27;s daunting to imagine just how far Mission of Burma could have taken its music had Roger Miller&#x27;s hearing problems not caused the band to break up the following year, but regardless of lost potential, very few American bands from the 1980s released an album as ambitious or as powerful as &quot;Vs.&quot;&quot;

==Legacy==
The album ranked at number 49 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1980s&quot; list. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the album number 25 on their list of the 40 Greatest Punk Albums.
