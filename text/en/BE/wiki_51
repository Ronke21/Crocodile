<text>Öland (, ; ; sometimes written Oland internationally) is the second-largest Swedish island and the smallest of the traditional provinces of Sweden. Öland has an area of and is located in the Baltic Sea just off the coast of Småland. The island has over 26,000 inhabitants. 

It is separated from the mainland by the Kalmar Strait and connected to it by the Öland Bridge, which opened on 30 September 1972. The county seat Kalmar is on the mainland at the other end of the bridge and is an important commercial centre related to the Öland economy. The island&#x27;s two municipalities are Borgholm and Mörbylånga named after their municipal seats. Much of the island is farmland, with fertile plains aided by the mild and sunny weather during summer.

Öland does not have separate political representation at the national level, and is fully integrated into Sweden as part of Kalmar County.

==Administration==
The traditional provinces of Sweden no longer serve administrative or political purposes but still exist as historical and cultural entities. Öland is part of the administrative county of Kalmar County (&quot;Kalmar län&quot;) and consists of the two municipalities of Borgholm Municipality and Mörbylånga Municipality. There was an Öland County in the short period between 1819 and 1826; otherwise, the island has been part of Kalmar County since 1634.

==Heraldry==

Öland was granted provincial arms in 1560, but it would not be until the 1940s that the province was assigned its proper ones. The arms granted to &quot;Öland&quot; had been mixed up with the arms granted to &quot;Åland&quot; and this was not discovered until the 20th century. While Öland changed its coat of arms, Åland, which was now a Finnish (autonomous) province, kept its established but originally unintended coat of arms. The deer is meant to symbolize the status of Öland as a royal game park and the arms are topped by a ducal crown. Blazon: &quot;Azure a Deer Or attired, hoofed and gorged Gules&quot;.

==History==
Archaeological evidence indicates the island of Öland was settled about 8000 BC, with excavations dating from the Paleolithic era showing the presence of hunter-gatherers. In the early Stone Age, settlers from the mainland migrated across the ice bridge that connected the island across the Kalmar Strait.

Evidence of habitation of Öland occurred at least as early as 6000 BC, when there were Stone Age settlements at Alby and other locations on the island. Burial grounds from the Iron Age through the Viking Age are clearly visible at Gettlinge, Hulterstad and other places on the perimeter ridge including stone ships. There are nineteen Iron Age ringforts identified on the island, only one of which, Eketorp, has been completely excavated, yielding over 24,000 artifacts. Around 900 AD, Wulfstan of Hedeby called the island &quot;Eowland&quot;, the land of the Eowans:
However, this is not the first mention of the Eowans. There is an even earlier mention of the tribe in the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Widsith&quot;:
Scholars such as Schütte and Kendrick have pointed out that there was probably an even earlier mention of the people of Öland in 98 AD, by Tacitus, who called them the &quot;Aviones&quot;:

In Swedish history, the island long served as a royal game park; Ottenby and Halltorp were in particular selected by the Swedish Crown in the Middle Ages as royal game reserves.

==Geography==
Öland is the second largest of the islands of Sweden and was historically divided into one chartered city and five hundreds.

==Climate==
Öland has a semi-continental oceanic climate with considerable temperature differences between summer and winter. There are two main weather stations, one located at the northern edge and the other at the southern edge. In spite of the more northerly latitude, Öland&#x27;s northern edge is far milder than its southern edge, since air warm over greater surrounding landmasses during days, whilst retaining heavy maritime features during night. It is also more representative for the island&#x27;s general climate, with only the deep south being much cooler down a narrow peninsula.

==Environment==
The dominant environmental feature of the island is the Stora Alvaret, a limestone pavement which is the habitat of numerous rare and endangered species. The first known scientific study of the biota of the Stora Alvaret occurred in the year 1741 with the visit of Linnaeus. The underlying bedrock layer is mainly Cambrian sandstone and alum chert, and Ordovician limestone that dates from an approximate range of 540 to 450 million years ago. The Cambrian trilobite &quot;Eccaparadoxides oelandicus&quot; is named after the island.

Öland is served by a perimeter highway, Route 136. In 2011 the Gripen Gas company filed a request for test drilling on Öland for natural gas. The request was approved by Bergsstaten, the governmental agency responsible for handling geological issues regarding prospecting. The approval has been met with criticism on the municipal and county administrative levels, citing that the many cracks in the limestone bedrock could cause the groundwater to become contaminated by the gas prospecting.

===Important Bird Area===
The eastern coast of Öland, including its grazed meadows, marshes, chalk cliffs and sandbanks, has been designated an 30,000 ha Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a suite of waterfowl, waders and terns, as well as breeding white-tailed sea-eagles.

==Culture==
The Borgholm Castle was built between 1669 and 1681 for Queen Hedvig Eleonora, and designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. In its vicinity sits the Solliden Palace, summer home to the royal family.

The limestone pavement habitat of southern Öland, known as Stora Alvaret, has been entered as a site of the UNESCO World Heritage program. Features of this are the many rare species found; prehistory sites such as Gettlinge and Eketorp; numerous old wooden windmills left standing, some of which date to the 17th century; and the special geological alvar landscape.

For a decade, Öland has been organizing an annual harvest festival called &quot;Skördefesten&quot; that takes place every October. In terms of this event, the island&#x27;s farmers gather with farmers from the rest of the country and sell their crops and let those that are interested take part in everyday life on their farms, among other activities. There are also many art exhibitions for display during Skördefesten especially during the art night Konstnatten.

The romantic poet Erik Johan Stagnelius was born in the Öland parish of Gärdslösa in 1793 and lived there until 16 years of age. He wrote several poems about the island. More modern writers living on or writing about Öland include novelist Margit Friberg (1904–1997), poet Anna Rydstedt (1928–1994), novelist Birgitta Trotzig (1929-2011), poet Lennart Sjögren (1930-), children novelist Eva Bexell (1945-), poet Tom Hedlund (1945-), novelist Johan Theorin (1963-), poet and novelist Magnus Utvik (1964-) and novelist Per Planhammar (1965-).

==Skördefest==
Skördefest is an annual harvest festival on Öland, held every September, which attracts thousands of visitors. Pumpkins are placed upon the top of bales of hay, a signal to buyers that fall harvest goods are available for sale at the location. In Borgholm, a &quot;pumpagubbe&quot; (pumpkin man), a large scarecrow like figure, built entirely of gourds, is erected at town center. The pumpagubbe celebrates the bounty of the Fall Harvest.

==Sports==
Football in the province is administered by Smålands Fotbollförbund. Each year the King&#x27;s Rally, a vintage motorcade, takes place in Öland.

<text>Roger McCluskey (August 24, 1930 – August 29, 1993) was an American IndyCar driver. He was raised in Tucson, Arizona.

He won championship titles in three divisions of the United States Auto Club: Sprints, Stocks, and Champ Cars. He won the USAC Sprint Car title in 1963 and 1966, the USAC Stock Car title in 1969 and 1970. The Champ Car title in 1973. His first USAC Stock Car start resulted in a runner-up finish in Phoenix, Arizona in January 1968, when he drove as a substitute driver for Norm Nelson.
McCluskey earned four USAC Midget Car wins, 23 USAC Sprint Car wins, 23 USAC Stock Car wins and five USAC Championship Car (national championship) wins (including his last start at Milwaukee in 1979, which is a rarity since most drivers don&#x27;t win their last race in their career). He was the USAC national champion in 1973. He started every Indianapolis 500 race from 1961 to 1979 except 1964, with a best finish of 3rd in 1973.

He also made four NASCAR Grand National Series starts from 1969 to 1977 with a best finish of second in 1970 at Riverside International Raceway.

He represented the USAC series in the 1974 International Race of Champions.

McCluskey raced for the Holman and Moody team in a Ford GT40 Mk.IIB at the 1967 LeMans 24hrs of Endurance, France. During this event, McCluskey is credited with pulling Mario Andretti to safety-and thus saving his life-after Andretti had seriously crashed his Ford GT40 Mk.IV when a front brake locked.

McCluskey died of cancer in Indianapolis, on August 29, 1993, just five days after his 63rd birthday. In 2004, the local United Sports Arizona Race Park hosted the Roger McCluskey Sprint Car Classic in his honor.

==Award==
He was inducted in the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1993.

He was also inducted into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 2002.

He was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2011.

Phayao was founded in 1096 as a small city-state kingdom. In the 13th century it gained enough importance to be an equal partner with King Mangrai of Lan Na and the Sukhothai kingdom. However, a later king of Lanna and 
Nan captured Phayao in 1338, and made it part of Lanna. During the Burmese rule of Lanna, the city was deserted. 

In 1843 in the reign of King Rama III, Phayao was re-established along with Chiang Rai and Muang Ngao to be a frontier city against the Burmese army located at Chiang Saen. In 1897 it became part of the province of Chiang Rai. On 28 August 1977, Phayao was separated from Chiang Rai and became a province of its own.

==Symbols==

<doc id="284525" wikidata="Q156401" url="?curid=284525" title="Chicken Run">
<text>Chicken Run is a 2000 animated adventure comedy film produced by Pathé and Aardman Features in partnership with DreamWorks Animation. Aardman&#x27;s first feature-length film, it was directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park with a screenplay by Karey Kirkpatrick from an original story by Lord and Park. The film stars the voices of Julia Sawalha, Mel Gibson, Tony Haygarth, Miranda Richardson, Phil Daniels, Lynn Ferguson, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, and Benjamin Whitrow. Set in the countryside of Yorkshire, the plot centres on a group of British anthropomorphic chickens who see an American rooster named Rocky Rhodes as their only hope to escape the farm when their owners want to turn them into chicken pies.

&quot;Chicken Run&quot; was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $220 million and becoming the highest-grossing stop-motion animated film in history. At the time, this film was DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s most successful release, but this was overtaken by &quot;Shrek&quot; the following year&quot;.&quot;

23 years later, a sequel, titled &quot;Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget&quot;, was released on Netflix on 15 December 2023. Its Netflix release followed its world premiere at the 67th BFI London Film Festival on 14 October 2023, which would also see preview screenings taking place at UK cinemas at the same time.

== Plot ==

In the countryside of Yorkshire, a flock of chickens live on an egg farm structured like a prisoner-of-war camp. The farm is run by the cruel Mrs Tweedy and her submissive husband, Mr Tweedy, who kill and eat any chicken that is no longer able to lay eggs. Led by the rebellious Ginger, the chickens constantly devise new ways to try to escape but are always caught. Mr Tweedy suspects the chickens are organised and plotting resistance, but his wife dismisses his theories while being frustrated with making minuscule profits.

One night, Ginger witnesses an American rooster named Rocky Rhodes glide over the coop&#x27;s fences and crash-land; the chickens put his sprained wing in a cast and hide him from the Tweedys, who have been promised a handsome reward by Rocky&#x27;s owner for his return. Inspired by Rocky&#x27;s apparent flying abilities, Ginger begs him to help teach her and the other chickens to fly so they can escape, threatening to alert the humans if he refuses. Rocky reluctantly gives them training lessons. One evening, a load of equipment is delivered to the farm, containing the parts for a chicken pie machine that Mrs Tweedy has ordered as part of a plan to convert the farm into a profitable pie-making factory. When the Tweedys increase the chickens&#x27; food rations and ignore the decline in egg production, Ginger deduces that the couple&#x27;s new plan is to fatten the chickens for slaughter. After Ginger and Rocky get into an argument, Rocky holds a morale-boosting dance party during which it is revealed that his wing is healed. Ginger insists that he demonstrate flying the next day, but Mr Tweedy finishes assembling the machine and puts Ginger in it for a test run. Rocky saves her and sabotages the machine, buying them time to warn the chickens and plan an escape from the farm.

The next day, Ginger finds Rocky has left, leaving behind part of a poster that shows that he is in fact part of a &quot;chicken cannonball&quot; act with no ability to fly on his own, making them realize that their chance to learn how to fly has been crushed. In the midst of being devastated, Ginger is inspired by elderly rooster Fowler&#x27;s stories of his time in the Royal Air Force to build an aircraft to flee the farm. The chickens assemble parts for the plane as Mr Tweedy fixes the pie-making machine. Meanwhile, Rocky comes across a billboard advertising Mrs Tweedy&#x27;s chicken pies and returns to the farm out of guilt.

Mrs Tweedy orders Mr Tweedy to gather all the chickens for the machine, but the chickens subdue him and finish the plane, which Ginger persuades Fowler to pilot. As the plane approaches the take-off ramp, Mr Tweedy is able to knock over the ramp before being knocked out; Ginger races to reset the ramp, but a now-alerted Mrs Tweedy attacks her. Before Mrs Tweedy can hurt Ginger, Rocky returns and subdues her, before holding up the ramp with Ginger, allowing the plane to take flight. Rocky and Ginger grab onto the runway lights, which have been snagged by the departing plane. An axe-wielding Mrs Tweedy follows them by climbing up the lights, but Ginger tricks Mrs Tweedy into cutting the line, sending her falling into the pie machine, blocking up the safety valve, causing it to explode in a mushroom cloud of gravy.

The chickens celebrate their victory after defeating the Tweedys while Ginger and Rocky kiss, and they fly to an island bird sanctuary where they make their home. Sometime later, the chickens have settled into their new home, and Rocky and Ginger have started a romantic relationship. Nick and Fetcher, two rats that have been helping the chickens throughout the escape, decide to set up their own egg farm, but they fall into a circular debate over whether they must use a chicken or egg to start it.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
&quot;Chicken Run&quot; was first conceived in 1995 by Aardman co-founder Peter Lord and &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; creator Nick Park. According to Park, the project started as a spoof on the 1963 film &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. &quot;Chicken Run&quot; was Aardman Animations&#x27; first feature-length production, which would be executive produced by Jake Eberts. Nick Park and Peter Lord, who run Aardman, directed the film, while Karey Kirkpatrick scripted, with additional input from Mark Burton and John O&#x27;Farrell.

When a chicken speaks, each sound corresponds to a different beak that was placed on the character.

Pathé agreed to finance the film in 1996, putting their finances into script development and model design. DreamWorks officially came on board in 1997. They beat out studios including Disney, 20th Century Fox (which had distributed the Wallace &amp; Gromit shorts in the U.S.), and Warner Bros. and largely won due to the perseverance of DreamWorks co-chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg; as a company they were eager to make their presence felt in the animation market in an attempt to compete with Disney&#x27;s dominance of the field. Katzenberg explained that he had &quot;been chasing these guys for five or six years, ever since I first saw &quot;Creature Comforts&quot;.&quot; DreamWorks secured their first animated feature with the film, and they handled distribution in all territories except Europe, which Pathé handled. The two studios co-financed the film. DreamWorks also retains rights to worldwide merchandising.

=== Animation ===
Principal photography began on 29 January 1998. During production, 30 sets were used with 80 animators working along with 180 people working overall. The result was one minute of film completed for each week of filming, and production wrapped on 18 June 1999.

=== Music ===
John Powell and Harry Gregson-Williams composed the music for the film, which was released on 20 June 2000 under the RCA Victor label. It was recorded at the Abbey Road Studios in London. Powell incorporated some kazoos and whistles to create an even funnier soundtrack.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported approval rating and an average rating of , based on reviews. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Chicken Run&quot; has all the charm of Nick Park&#x27;s &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot;, and something for everybody. The voice acting is fabulous, the slapstick is brilliant, and the action sequences are spectacular.&quot; At Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave three and a half stars out of four, writing: &quot;So it truly is a matter of life and death for the chickens to escape from the Tweedy Chicken Farm in &quot;Chicken Run&quot;, a magical new animated film that looks and sounds like no other. Like the otherwise completely different &quot;Babe&quot;, this is a movie that uses animals as surrogates for our hopes and fears, and as the chickens run through one failed escape attempt after another, the charm of the movie wins us over.&quot;

&quot;Chicken Run&quot; and its sequel have been noted for their depiction of feminism, revolution, Marxism, veganism and fascism. According to Florentine StrzeIczyk, &quot;Chicken Run&quot; points to the way that masculinity and femininity are mediated in popular film genres. It also received attention for its female-led cast. Film School Rejects called the movie feminist, noting that &quot;the stereotypical &#x27;woman&#x27;s work&#x27; of these female chickens (such as their sewing and knitting) is crucial in constructing their mechanism for escape and vital towards the revolution itself.&quot; The Islamic Republic of Iran News Network argued it was a way to disguise Zionism and Western propaganda.

=== Box office ===
On opening weekend, the film grossed $17,506,162 for a $7,027 average from 2,491 theatres. Overall, the film placed second behind &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot;. In its second weekend, the film held well as it slipped only 25% to $13,192,897 for a $4,627 average from expanding to 2,851 theatres and finishing in fourth place. The film&#x27;s widest release was 2,953 theatres, after grossing $106,834,564 in the United States and Canada. In the United Kingdom, it was the third highest-grossing film of the year with a gross of $43 million. With an additional $75 million from other markets, it grossed $224,834,564 worldwide. Produced on an estimated budget of $42–45 million, the film was a huge box office hit. To date, it is still the highest grossing stop motion animated movie.

=== Accolades ===
== Home media ==
&quot;Chicken Run&quot; was released on VHS and DVD in the United States on 21 November 2000 by DreamWorks Home Entertainment.

Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released &quot;Chicken Run&quot; on Blu-ray in North America on 22 January 2019.

== Sequel ==

In January 2022, the title for the sequel was revealed as &quot;Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget&quot; and was announced for a 2023 release on Netflix. Zachary Levi, Thandiwe Newton, Romesh Ranganathan and Daniel Mays were revealed to be replacing Gibson, Sawalha, Spall and Daniels as the voices of Rocky, Ginger, Nick and Fetcher; David Bradley voiced Fowler due to Whitrow&#x27;s death in 2017, while Horrocks, Staunton and Ferguson reprised their roles as Babs, Bunty and Mac. Bella Ramsey was cast as Molly, while Nick Mohammed and Josie Sedgwick-Davies voiced two new characters, Dr Fry and Frizzle, respectively. Sam Fell directed with Steve Pegram and Leyla Hobart producing. Kirkpatrick and O&#x27;Farrell wrote the script with Rachel Tunnard. In June 2023, Gregson-Williams was revealed to be composing the sequel. Later that month, it was officially announced that the film would release on Netflix on 15 December 2023. Its Netflix release followed its world premiere at the 67th BFI London Film Festival on 14 October 2023, which would also see preview screenings taking place at UK cinemas at the same time.

<text>Clarence Leonidas Fender (August 10, 1909 – March 21, 1991) was an American inventor and founder of the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. Fender designed the company&#x27;s iconic early instruments: the Fender Telecaster, the first mass-produced solid-body electric guitar; the Fender Stratocaster, among the most iconic electric guitars; and the Fender Precision Bass, which set the standard for electric basses. He also designed the Fender Bassman amplifier, which became the archetype for later amplifiers (notably by Marshall and Mesa Boogie) that dominated rock and roll music.

Fender, who was not a guitarist himself, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Early life and education==
Clarence Leonidas Fender was born on August 10, 1909, to Clarence Monte Fender and Harriet Elvira Wood, owners of a successful orange grove located between Anaheim and Fullerton, California. At the age of eight, Fender developed a tumor in his left eye, resulting in the eye being removed and being replaced with a glass eye, making him ineligible for the draft in World War II later in life.

As a youth, Fender played piano and saxophone before his interests shifted toward electronics. When he was 14, Fender visited his uncle&#x27;s automotive-electric shop in Santa Maria, and was fascinated by a radio his uncle had built from spare parts. Soon thereafter, Fender began repairing radios in a small shop in his parents&#x27; home.

In 1928, Fender graduated from Fullerton Union High School, and entered Fullerton Junior College as an accounting major, though he continued to work with electronics. After college, Fender worked as an ice delivery man and later bookkeeper. Around this time, he was approached by a local bandleader asking him to build six public address systems for use in Hollywood dance halls.

==Career==
===Fender Radio Service===
In 1938, with a borrowed $600 (), Fender and his wife Esther returned to Fullerton, and started his own radio repair shop, Fender Radio Service. Soon, musicians and band leaders began coming to him for public address systems, which he built, rented, and sold. They also visited his store for amplification for the amplified acoustic guitars that were beginning to show up on the southern California music scene—in big band and jazz music, and for the electric &quot;Hawaiian&quot; or &quot;lap steel&quot; guitars becoming popular in country music.

===Early guitars===
During World War II, Fender met Clayton Orr &quot;Doc&quot; Kauffman, an inventor and lap steel player who had worked for Rickenbacker, which had been building and selling lap steel guitars for a decade. While with Rickenbacker, Kauffman had invented the &quot;Vibrola&quot; tailpiece, a precursor to the later vibrato tailpiece. Fender convinced him that they should team up, and they started the &quot;K&amp;F Manufacturing Corporation&quot; to design and build amplified Hawaiian guitars and amplifiers. In 1944, Fender and Kauffman patented a lap steel guitar with an electric pickup already patented by Fender. In 1945, they began selling the guitar in a kit with an amplifier designed by K&amp;F. In 1946, Doc pulled out of K&amp;F and Fender revised the company and renamed it &quot;Fender Manufacturing&quot;, and then later &quot;Fender Electric Instrument Co.&quot; at the end of 1947 and he handed over the reins of his radio shop to Dale Hyatt.

As the Big Bands fell out of vogue towards the end of World War II, small combos playing boogie-woogie, rhythm and blues, western swing, and honky-tonk formed throughout the United States. Many of these outfits embraced the electric guitar because it could give a few players the power of an entire horn section. Pickup-equipped archtops were the guitars of choice in the dance bands of the late 1940s, but the increasing popularity of roadhouses and dance halls created a growing need for louder, cheaper, and more durable instruments. Players also needed &quot;faster&quot; necks and better intonation to play what the country players called &quot;take-off lead guitar.&quot; In the late 1940s, solid-body electric guitars began to rise in popularity, yet they were still considered novelty items, with the Rickenbacker Spanish Electro guitar being the most commercially available solid-body, and Les Paul&#x27;s one-off home-made &quot;Log&quot; and the Bigsby Travis guitar made by Paul Bigsby for Merle Travis being the most visible early examples.

Fender recognized the potential for an electric guitar that was easy to hold, tune, and play, and would not feed back at dance hall volumes as the typical archtop would. In 1948, he finished the prototype of a thin solid-body electric; the first one-pickup model was released in 1950 as the Fender Esquire, while a two-pickup version, initially called the Broadcaster but renamed the Telecaster after a trademark issue, was released the year after. The Telecaster became one of the most popular electric guitars in history.

===Stratocaster===

Instead of updating the Telecaster, Fender decided, based on customer feedback, to leave the Telecaster as it was and design a new, upscale solid-body guitar to sell alongside the basic Telecaster. Western swing guitarist Bill Carson was one of the chief critics of the Telecaster, stating that the new design should have individually adjustable bridge saddles, four or five pickups, a vibrato unit that could be used in either direction and return to proper tuning, and a contoured body for enhanced comfort over the slab-body Telecaster&#x27;s harsh edges. Fender, assisted by draftsman Freddie Tavares, began designing the Stratocaster in late 1953. It included a rounder, less &quot;club-like&quot; neck (at least for the first year of issue) and a double cutaway for easier reach to the upper registers.

Another novelty to the Stratocaster design included the use of three pickups wired to offer three different voicings, two of which could be further tailored by the player by adjusting the two tone controls. The Stratocaster was the first electric guitar on the market to offer three pickups and a &quot;tremolo&quot; arm (which was actually used for vibrato, not tremolo), which became widely used by guitarists. The three pickups could be selected using the standard three-way switch to give the guitar different sounds and options by using the &quot;neck&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;bridge&quot; pickups. Though Fender preferred the sound of single pickups, guitarists discovered they could get the switch to stay between the detent positions and activate two pickups at once. The five-way switch was finally implemented as a factory option in late 1976, adding the detent combinations of neck+middle or bridge+middle musicians had used for years.

===Electric basses===
During this time, Fender also tackled the problems experienced by players of the acoustic double bass, who could no longer compete for volume with the other musicians. Besides, double basses were also large, bulky, and difficult to transport.

With the Precision Bass (or &quot;P-Bass&quot;), released in 1951, Fender addressed both issues: the Telecaster-based Precision Bass was small and portable, and its solid-body construction and four-magnet, single coil pickup let it play at higher volumes without feedback. Along with the Precision Bass (so named because its fretted neck allowed bassists to play with &quot;precision&quot;), Fender introduced a bass amplifier, the Fender Bassman, a 25-watt amplifier with one 15-inch speaker (later updated to 45 watts and four 10-inch speakers).

1954 saw an update of the Precision Bass to coincide with the introduction of the Stratocaster. Incorporating some of the body contours of the Stratocaster, the update also included a two-section nickel-plated bridge and a white single-layer pickguard.

In June 1957, Fender announced a redesign of the Precision Bass. The remake included a larger headstock, a new pickguard design, a bridge with four steel saddles that could be individually adjusted and a new split single-coil pickup. This proved to be the final version of the instrument, which has changed little since then. In 1960, rosewood fingerboards, wider color selections and a three-ply pickguard became available for the P-Bass.

1960 saw the release of the Jazz Bass, a sleeker, updated bass with a slimmer neck, and offset waist body and two single coil pickups (as opposed to the Precision Bass and its split-humbucking pickup that had been introduced in 1957). Like its predecessor, the Jazz Bass (or simply &quot;J-Bass&quot;) was an instant hit and has remained popular to this day, and early models are highly sought after by collectors.

===1970 and later: Music Man and G&amp;L===
In the 1950s, Fender contracted a streptococcal sinus infection that impaired his health to the point where he decided to wind up his business affairs, selling the Fender company to CBS in 1965. As part of this deal, Fender signed a non-compete clause and remained a consultant with Fender for a while. Shortly after selling the company, he changed doctors and was cured of his illness. In 1971, Forrest White and Tom Walker formed the Tri-Sonix company (often incorrectly referred to as &quot;Tri-Sonic&quot;), based in Santa Ana, California. Walker and White went to Fender to help finance their company and it evolved into &quot;Music Man&quot;, a name Fender preferred over their name. After considerable financing, in 1975, Fender became its president.

The StingRay bass was an innovative early instrument. Though the body design borrowed heavily from the Precision Bass, the StingRay is largely considered the first production bass with active electronics. The StingRay&#x27;s two-band active equalizer, high-output humbucking pickup, and high-gloss finished neck became a favorite of many influential bassists, including Louis Johnson, Bernard Edwards, John Deacon, Ben Orr, John Taylor, Tony Levin, Pino Palladino, Kim Deal, Tim Commerford, Gail Ann Dorsey and Flea. Later, a three-band active equalizer was introduced on the StingRay. Music Man was active in making amplifiers as well, but the HD-130 Reverb, designed to compete with the Twin Reverb, came at a time when the clean sounds of the Twin were going out of fashion.

In 1979, Fender and old friends George Fullerton and Dale Hyatt started a new company called G&amp;L (&quot;George &amp; Leo&quot;) Musical Products. G&amp;L guitar designs tended to lean heavily upon the looks of Fender&#x27;s original guitars such as the Stratocaster and Telecaster, but incorporated innovations such as enhanced tremolo systems and electronics.

==Personal life and death==
In 1934, Fender married Esther Klosky, and the couple remained together until Esther&#x27;s death from cancer in 1979. Fender remarried in 1980; his second wife Phyllis became an Honorary Chairman of G&amp;L. Despite suffering several minor strokes, Fender continued to work. On March 21, 1991, he died of complications from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was buried at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana, California, next to his first wife Esther. Phyllis Fender died on July 22, 2020.

Fender&#x27;s accomplishments for &quot;contributions of outstanding technical significance to the recording field&quot; were acknowledged with a Technical Grammy Award in 2009. Fender Avenue in Fullerton, California was named after him.

<doc id="284528" wikidata="Q746674" url="?curid=284528" title="Bitboard">
<text>A bitboard is a specialized bit array data structure commonly used in computer systems that play board games, where each bit corresponds to a game board space or piece. This allows parallel bitwise operations to set or query the game state, or determine moves or plays in the game.

Bits in the same bitboard relate to each other by the rules of the game, often forming a game position when taken together. Other bitboards are commonly used as masks to transform or answer queries about positions. Bitboards are applicable to any game whose progress is represented by the state of, or presence of pieces on, discrete spaces of a gameboard, by mapping of the space states to bits in the data structure. Bitboards are a more efficient alternative board representation to the traditional &quot;mailbox&quot; representation, where each piece or space on the board is an array element.

Bitboards are especially effective when the associated bits of various related states on the board fit into a single word or double word of the CPU architecture, so that single bitwise operators like AND and OR can be used to build or query game states.

Among the computer game implementations that use bitboards are chess, checkers, othello and word games. The scheme was first employed in checkers programs in the 1950s, and since the mid-1970s has been the de facto standard for game board representation in computer automatons.

==Description==

A bitboard, a specialized bit field, is a format that packs multiple related boolean variables into the same machine word, typically representing a position on a board game, or state of a game. Each bit represents a space; when the bit is positive, a property of that space is true. Bitboards allow the computer to answer some questions about game state with one bitwise operation. For example, if a chess program wants to know if the white player has any pawns in the center of the board (center four squares) it can just compare a bitboard for the player&#x27;s pawns with one for the center of the board using a bitwise AND operation. If there are no center pawns then the result will be all zero bits (i.e. equal to zero). Multiple bitboards may represent different properties of spaces over the board, and special or temporary bitboards (like temporary variables) may represent local properties or hold intermediate collated results.

The efficacy of bitboards is augmented by two other properties of the implementation. First, bitboards are fast to incrementally update, such as flipping the bits at the source and destination positions in a bitboard for piece location when a piece is moved. Second, bitmaps representing static properties like all spaces attacked by each piece type for every position on a chessboard can be pre-collated and stored in a table, so that answering a question like &quot;what are the legal moves of a knight on space e4?&quot; can be answered by a single memory fetch.

Bitfield implementations take advantage of the presence of fullword (32-bit or 64-bit) bitwise logical operations like AND, OR, NOT and others on modern CPU architectures in order to be efficient. Bitboards may not be effective on earlier 8- and 16-bit minicomputer and microprocessor architectures.

==Implementation issues==
As a result of necessary compression and encoding of the contents of massive tables and the probability of transcription or encoding errors, bitboard programs are tedious for software developers to either write or debug. Auxiliary generative methods not part of the application are usually required to build the tables.

===Processor use===
====Pros====
Bitboard representations use parallel bitwise operations available on nearly all CPUs that complete in one cycle and are fully pipelined and cached etc. Nearly all CPUs have AND, OR, NOR, and XOR. 
Furthermore, modern CPUs have instruction pipelines that queue instructions for execution. A processor with multiple execution units can perform more than one instruction per cycle if more than one instruction is available in the pipeline. Normal instruction sequences with branches may cause the pipeline to empty if a branch is mispredicted. Many bitboard operations require fewer conditionals and therefore increase pipelining and make effective use of multiple execution units on many CPUs.

CPUs have a bit width which they are designed toward and can carry out bitwise operations in one cycle in this width. So, on a 64-bit or more CPU, 64-bit operations can occur in one instruction. There may be support for higher or lower width instructions. Many 32-bit CPUs may have some 64-bit instructions and those may take more than one cycle or otherwise be handicapped compared to their 32-bit instructions.

If the bitboard is larger than the width of the instruction set, multiple instructions will be required to perform a full-width operation on it. So a program using 64-bit bitboards would run faster on a 64-bit processor than on a 32-bit processor.

====Cons====
Bitboard representations have much longer code, both source and object code. Long bit-twiddling sequences are technically tricky to write and debug. The bitboards themselves are sparse, sometimes containing only a single one bit in 64, so bitboard implementations are memory-intensive. Both these issues may increase cache misses or cause cache thrashing.

If the processor does not have hardware instructions for &#x27;first one&#x27; (or &#x27;count leading zeros&#x27;) and &#x27;count ones&#x27; (or &#x27;count zeros&#x27;), the implementation will be significantly handicapped, as these operations are extremely inefficient to code as assembly language loops.

===Cache and memory use===
====Pros====
Bitboards require more memory than piece-list board data structures, but are more execution efficient because many loop-and-compare operations are reduced to a single (or small number of) bitwise operation(s). For example, in mailbox, determining whether &quot;piece&quot; attacks &quot;space&quot; requires generating and looping through legal moves of &quot;piece&quot; and comparing the final space with &quot;space&quot;. With bitboards, the legal moves of &quot;piece&quot; are stored in a bitmap, and that map is ANDed with the bitmap for &quot;space&quot;. A non-zero result means that &quot;piece&quot; attacks &quot;space&quot;.

====Cons====
For some games, writing a bitboard engine requires a fair amount of source code including data tables that will be longer than the compact mailbox/enumeration implementation. For mobile devices (such as cell phones) with a limited number of registers or processor instruction cache, this can cause a problem. For full-sized computers, it may cause cache misses between level-one and level-two cache. This is only a potential problem, not a major drawback, as most machines will have enough instruction cache for this not to be an issue.

===Incremental update===
Some kinds of bitboards are derived from others by an elaborate process of cross-correlation, such as the attack maps in chess. Reforming all these maps at each change of game state (such as a move) can be prohibitively expensive, so derived bitmaps are incrementally updated, a process which requires intricate and precise code. This is much faster to execute, because only bitmaps associated with changed spaces, not all bitmaps over the board, need to change. Without incremental update, bitmapped representation may not be more efficient than the older mailbox representation where update is intrinsically local and incremental.

===Precomputed bitmaps and table lookup===
Some kinds of bitmaps that don&#x27;t depend on board configurations can be precomputed and retrieved by table lookup rather than collated after a move or state change of the board, such as spaces attacked by a knight or king located on each of 64 spaces of a chessboard that would otherwise require an enumeration.

== Chess bitboards ==
The obvious, and simplest representation of the configuration of pieces on a chessboard, is as a list (array) of pieces in a conveniently searchable order (such as smallest to largest in value) that maps each piece to its location on the board. Analogously, collating the spaces attacked by each piece requires a serial enumeration of such spaces for a piece. This scheme is called &quot;mailbox addressing&quot;. Separate lists are maintained for white and black pieces, and often for white and black pawns. The maps are updated each move, which requires a linear search (or two if a piece was captured) through the piece list. The advantage of mailbox is simple code; the disadvantage is linear lookups are slow. Faster, but more elaborate data structures that map pieces to locations are called &quot;bitboards&quot;.

===Standard===

In bitboard representations, each bit of a 64 bit word (or double word on 32-bit architectures) is associated with a square of the chessboard. Any mapping of bits to squares can be used, but by broad convention, bits are associated with squares from left to right and bottom to top, so that bit 0 represents square a1, bit 7 is square h1, bit 56 is square a8 and bit 63 is square h8.

Many different configurations of the board are usually represented by their own bitboards including the locations of the kings, all white pawns, all black pawns, as well as bitboards for each of the other piece types or combinations of pieces like all white pieces. Two attack bitboards are also universal: one bitboard per square for all pieces attacking the square, and the inverse bitboard for all squares attacked by a piece for each square containing a piece. Bitboards can also be constants like one representing the first rank, which would have one bits in positions 0 - 7. Other local or transitional bitboards like &quot;all spaces adjacent to the king attacked by opposing pieces&quot; may be collated as necessary or convenient.

An example of the use of the bitboards would be determining whether a piece is &quot; en prise&quot;: bitboards for &quot;all friendly pieces guarding &quot;space&quot;&quot; and &quot;all opposing pieces attacking &quot;space&quot;&quot; would allow matching the pieces to readily determine whether a target piece on &quot;space&quot; is &quot;en prise&quot;.

One of the drawbacks of standard bitboards is collating the attack vectors of the sliding pieces (rook, bishop, queen), because they have an indefinite number of attack spaces depending on other occupied spaces. This requires several lengthy sequences of masks, shifts and complements per piece.

=== Auxiliary bitboard representations ===
In acknowledgement of the code size and computing complexity of generating bitboards for the attack vectors of sliding pieces, alternate bitboard data structures have been devised to collate them. The bitboard representations of knights, kings, pawns and other board configurations is unaffected by the use of auxiliary bitboards for the sliding pieces.

====Rotated bitboards====
Rotated bitboards are complementary bitboard data structures that enable tabularizing of sliding piece attack vectors, one for file attack vectors of rooks, and one each for the diagonal and anti-diagonal attack vectors of bishops (rank attacks of rooks can be indexed from standard bitboards). With these bitboards, a single table lookup replaces lengthy sequences of bitwise operations.

These bitboards rotate the board occupancy configuration by 90 degrees, 45 degrees, and/or 315 degrees. A standard bitboard will have one byte per rank of the chess board. With this bitboard it&#x27;s easy to determine rook attacks across a rank, using a table indexed by the occupied square and the occupied positions in the rank (because rook attacks stop at the first occupied square). By rotating the bitboard 90 degrees, rook attacks up and down a file can be examined the same way. Adding bitboards rotated 45 degrees and 315 degrees (-45 degrees) produces bitboards in which the diagonals are easy to examine. The queen can be examined by combining rook and bishop attacks. Actually rotating a bitboard is an inelegant transformation that can take dozens of instructions.

====Direct hashing====
The rank and file attack vectors of rooks and the diagonal and anti-diagonal attack vectors of bishops can be separately masked and used as indices into a hash table of precomputed attack vectors depending on occupancy, 8-bits each for rooks and 2-8 bits each for bishops. The full attack vector of a piece is obtained as the union of each of the two unidirectional vectors indexed from the hash table. The number of entries in the hash table is modest, on the order of 8*2^8 or 2K bytes, but two hash function computations and two lookups per piece are required., see the hashing scheme employed.

====Magic bitboards====
Magic bitboards are an extrapolation of the time-space tradeoff of direct hashing lookup of attack vectors. These use a transmutation of the full attack vector as an index into the hash table. &quot;Magic&quot; is a misnomer, and simply refers to the generation and use of a perfect hash function in conjunction with tricks to reduce the potential size of the hash table that would have to be stored in memory, which is 8*2^64 or 144 exabytes. The first observation is that the &quot;outer squares&quot; or first and eighth ranks together with the &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;h&#x27; files are irrelevant to the occupancy of the attack vector: the piece attacks those squares or not (depending on other blocking pieces) regardless of occupancy, so these can be eliminated from consideration, leaving just 6x6 or 36 squares (~bits in the corresponding hash function). As with other schemes which require a perfect hashing function, an exhaustive process of enumeration, partly algorithmic and partly trial and error, is necessary to generate the hash function. But the intractable issue remains: these are very active tables, and their size (fewer than a million entries in most cases) is huge relative to the lower level cache sizes of modern chip architectures, resulting in cache flooding. So magic bitboards in many applications provide no performance gain over more modest hashing schemes or rotated bitboards.

==History==
The bitboard method for representing a board game appears to have been invented in the mid-1950s, by Arthur Samuel and was used in his checkers program.
For the more complicated game of chess, it appears the method was independently rediscovered later by the Kaissa team in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s, and again by the authors of the U.S. Northwestern University program &quot;Chess&quot; in the early 1970s. The 64-bit word length of 1970s super computers like Amdahl and Cray machines, facilitated the development of bitboard representations which conveniently mapped the 64-squares of the chessboard to bits of a word.

Rotated bitboards for collating the moves of sliding pieces were invented by Professor Robert Hyatt, author of Cray Blitz and Crafty chess engines, sometime in the mid-1990s and shared with the Dark Thought programming team. They were later implemented in Crafty and Dark Thought, but the first published description wasn&#x27;t until 1997.

A decade later, direct lookup methods using masked ranks, files and diagonals to index a table of attack vectors depending on occupancy states of bits under the mask, were introduced. One such scheme utilizing a perfect hash function to eliminate hash collisions, was termed &quot;magic bitboards&quot;. Nonetheless, the large size and high access rates of such tables caused memory occupancy and cache contention issues, and weren&#x27;t necessarily more efficacious than the rotated bitboard approach.
Today, game programs remain divided, with the best scheme being application dependent.

==Other games==
Many other games besides chess benefit from bitboards.

* In Connect Four, they allow for very efficient testing for four consecutive discs, by just two shift + AND operations per direction.

<doc id="284533" wikidata="Q1155069" url="?curid=284533" title="IBM PCjr">
<text>The IBM PCjr (pronounced &quot;PC junior&quot;) was a home computer produced and marketed by IBM from March 1984 to May 1985, intended as a lower-cost variant of the IBM PC with hardware capabilities better suited for video games, in order to compete more directly with other home computers such as the Apple II and Commodore 64.

It retained the IBM PC&#x27;s 8088 CPU and BIOS interface, but provided enhanced graphics and sound, ROM cartridge slots, built-in joystick ports, and an infrared wireless keyboard. The PCjr supported expansion via &quot;sidecar&quot; modules, which could be attached to the side of the unit.

Despite widespread anticipation, the PCjr was ultimately unsuccessful in the market. It was only partially IBM PC compatible, limiting support for IBM&#x27;s software library, its chiclet keyboard was widely criticized for its poor quality and limited expandability, and it was initially offered with a maximum of of RAM, insufficient for many PC programs.

==Models==
The PCjr came in two models:

* 4860-004 - 64 KB of memory, priced at US$669 ()
* 4860-067 - 128 KB of memory and a 360 KB, 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, priced at US$1,269 ()

The PCjr was manufactured for IBM in Lewisburg, Tennessee by Teledyne.

A related machine, the IBM JX, was sold in the Japan, Australia and New Zealand markets.

== Hardware ==
The PCjr chassis is made entirely of plastic, unlike the all-steel chassis of the IBM PC. A 5.25&quot; front bay allows the installation of a 180/360K floppy disk drive. The internal floppy drive was a half-height Qume 5.25&quot; unit; IBM also used these drives in the PC Portable, but the PCjr units were specially equipped with a small fan to prevent overheating since the computer did not have a case fan.

=== Cartridges ===
The front of the PCjr exposes a pair of cartridge slots in which the user can insert software on ROM cartridges, as was common with other home computers. Each cartridge can contain up to 64 KB of ROM. When a ROM cartridge is inserted, the machine can automatically restart and boot off of the ROM, without requiring the user to manually reboot. This auto-restart function is an optional feature of each cartridge: a cartidge can either restart the machine or not when it is inserted, depending on the construction of the cartridge. PCjr cartridges are strictly read-only, unlike the software cartridges of some other contemporary computers and game consoles which can also be equipped with read/write memory (RAM) or I/O hardware in a straightforward way.

Cartridges can also replace the system BIOS and other firmware. A number of patches from various vendors are included on a single &quot;combo-cartridge&quot;, licensed and sold by PC Enterprises, to support add-on hardware, bypass certain limitations of design, and keep up with changing OS requirements.

=== Processor ===
Like the IBM PC, the PCjr uses an Intel 8088 clocked at 4.77 MHz.

Despite using the same CPU and clock speed, performance is often inferior to the PC, because access to system RAM is delayed by wait states added by the Video Gate Array to synchronize shared access to RAM between the CPU and the video hardware. IBM claimed that an average of two wait states are added, but the designers of the Tandy 1000, a clone of the PCjr, claimed that six was a more accurate figure.

This delay only applies to software resident in the first 64 KB or 128 KB of RAM inside the system unit itself, and not to programs or data located in ROM - including software on ROM cartridges plugged into the front of the PCjr - or in additional RAM in a sidecar attachment. Under these circumstances the PCjr should run at full speed. The most common instances in which this maximum speed would be achieved are when running games or productivity applications from ROM cartridges. In fact, because the PCjr video subsystem continuously refreshes the system internal DRAM transparently, without disturbing the CPU, programs running from ROM on the PCjr may actually run slightly faster on the PCjr than on an IBM PC or XT.

===Video===


Unlike the IBM PC, which required a separate video card, the PCjr display hardware was built in to the system board. At the time, the only cards available from IBM for the PC were the monochrome MDA and color CGA boards. PCjr graphics were similar to CGA, with several new video modes:
* 160 × 200 at 16 colors
* 320 × 200 at 16 colors
* 640 × 200 at 4 colors

The primary improvement over CGA is the greater color depth. CGA could only display 4 colors in its medium-resolution mode, and 2 colors in high-resolution. The PCjr increases these to 16 and 4 colors.

Video modes on the PCjr use varying amounts of system memory: 40 x 25 text mode uses 1 KB, for instance, while 320 x 200 x 16 and 640 x 200 x 4 use 32 KB. These latter two modes, as well as 80 x 25 text mode, are referred to in documentation as &quot;high bandwidth modes&quot; and are unsupported on base models with only 64 KB of memory.

Multiple text or graphics pages can be used for page-flipping as long as there is enough memory, a feature missing from the CGA. The CGA also did not provide a VBLANK interrupt, making it hard to detect when the screen was beginning to be drawn, but the PCjr provides this on IRQ 5, an important feature for smooth page-flipping.

The video system also has a &quot;blink&quot; feature which toggles the palette between the first and second groups of eight palette registers at the same rate used for the PCs blinking text attribute, and a palette bit-masking feature that can be used to switch between palette subsets without reprogramming palette registers.

Unlike CGA, PCjr has palette registers which allow the colors in all modes to be chosen from the full 16-color RGBI palette. When the BIOS is used to set a video mode, it sets up the palette table to emulate the CGA color palette for that mode. Programs specifically written to use PCjr graphics can subsequently reprogram the palette table to use any colors desired. Palette changes must be made during horizontal or vertical blanking periods of a video frame in order to avoid disrupting the display (transiently during the palette change).

The monitor included with the PCjr is a 12&quot; TTL RGBI display like those supported by the CGA, but including an internal amplified speaker. Also like CGA, the PCjr supported composite video out for use with a TV or composite monitor.

A Motorola 6845 CRTC like the one used in the MDA and CGA adapters, and a custom IBM chip called the Video Gate Array (VGA) constitute the bulk of the PCjr video hardware. Several discrete standard logic devices complete the video subsystem. The 6845 is responsible for the basic raster timing and video data address sequencing, and the Video Gate Array contains all the additional timing logic, video data demultiplexing logic, color processing logic, and programmable palette table logic, as well as the logic for multiplexing RAM access between the 8088 CPU and the video generation circuitry. For programming, the CRTC is generally compatible with the CGA at the hardware register level. Some other CGA programming details, in particular the Mode Control Register and the Color Select Register (at I/O addresses 3D8h and 3D9h respectively), are not compatible, as the PCjr provides the equivalent functionality through different registers inside the Video Gate Array which are accessed in a completely different manner through a single I/O address (3DAh).

The 6845 CRTC and the VGA together are responsible for refreshing the internal DRAM of the PCjr, which complicates the process of switching video modes on the PCjr. Resetting the VGA, which must be done during certain video mode switches, must be done by code not running from the system RAM controlled by the VGA, and if the CRTC or the VGA is disabled for too long, the contents of the internal RAM can be lost. Additional external DRAM (in sidecar expansion modules) is refreshed independently and never affected by a video mode switch.

Of the three new modes, 160 x 200 x 16 mode has the same layout as CGA graphics modes; the odd and even scanlines are stored in the first and second half of the video buffer, each half being 8k in size, and every four bits represents one pixel. The 320 x 200 x 16 and 640 x 200 x 4 modes have four blocks of scanlines; every four or two bits respectively represents a pixel.

Since the PCjr uses the main system RAM for the video buffer, less memory is available for software than on a standard PC, which has separate dedicated video memory in the A000h-BFFFh segments, above conventional memory.
===Sound===
The PCjr&#x27;s sound is provided by a Texas Instruments SN76496 which can produce three square waves of varying amplitude and frequency along with a noise channel powered by a shift register. It is similar to the programmable sound generator chips used in game consoles such as the Master System. The PCjr design also allows for an analog sound source in an expansion-bus &quot;sidecar&quot; module, and a software-controlled internal analog switch can select the source for the sound output from among the PC speaker, the SN76489, the cassette port, or the expansion-bus sound source. Only one sound source can be selected at a time; the sources cannot be mixed.

===Keyboard / Lightpen===

The original keyboard included with the PCjr was a wireless design using infrared line-of-sight communication, which IBM initially marketed as the &quot;Freeboard.&quot; This is a chiclet keyboard with small, flat, calculator style plastic keycaps. The keycaps are blank, with the labels printed between keys so that overlays can be used. The PCjr keyboard has 62 keys rather than the 83 of the PC keyboard, and the remaining keys must be entered by holding a modifier key.

For infrared wireless operation, the keyboard is powered by four AA cells. Certain types of room lighting can cause interference with the infrared keyboard sensor, and multiple keyboards cannot be used wirelessly in the same room without problems.

IBM sold a cable which could be plugged in between the keyboard and computer if the user wanted a more reliable connection, which also eliminated the need for batteries, since the keyboard IR receiver is automatically disabled when the cord is attached to the computer.

The chiclet design was not well received, and in 1984 IBM began shipping a new design, still wireless, but using more conventionally shaped keycaps.

The PCjr also has a light pen port. Besides being used for a light pen (a rarely purchased option), this port can be used in combination with the serial port to supply voltage to a Mouse Systems optical mouse of the same design as those for Sun workstations.

=== Expansion ===

The back of the machine does not have any expansion slots. Instead, several permanently mounted, proprietary connectors provide attachment to many built-in hardware capabilities, which replaced many of the features that PC expansion cards provided, including:

* Graphics hardware
* Multichannel sound
* Joystick ports
* Lightpen interface
* Serial port
* Cassette interface

Internally the PCjr did have expansion slots to support specific upgrades: a RAM upgrade, a modem, and a floppy drive.

On the right side of the machine, the system bus was exposed for use with &quot;sidecars,&quot; upgrade modules which attached to the side of the machine. Third-party manufacturers produced a number of expansion units for the PCjr.

==Software==
The primary OS for the PCjr was PC DOS, like the IBM PC, and it supported a large amount of PC software, with some incompatibilities.

PC DOS 2.10 is the minimum version of DOS required for the PCjr. IBM&#x27;s OEM versions of MS-DOS supported the machine up to DOS 3.30, but memory expansion was required for DOS 3.20 and 3.30.

Like the original PC, the PCjr has BASIC in ROM, but includes Cartridge BASIC instead of Cassette BASIC. In addition to cartridge support, it extended the standard IBM BASIC with commands to support the new video and audio functionality. The system will boot into Cartridge BASIC if no cartridge or boot disk is present.

=== Compatibility ===
The register mapping of the PCjr&#x27;s video hardware is different from the IBM CGA card, so software that tries to modify or read registers directly will not work. The PCjr has a &quot;gate&quot; register to which software writes the number of the video register to be accessed, followed by the value to be written into it. Alteration of other CRTC registers cannot be assumed to produce the same results from the PCjr video system as from the CGA.

Programs for the CGA that manipulate the CRTC start address, and that rely on address wrap-around above address 0xBC000, may not work correctly on the PCjr because it always has a 32 KB contiguous block of RAM in the video area from address 0xB8000 through 0xBFFFF. The PCjr&#x27;s video memory cannot be moved above 128k if expansion memory is added, so some PC software that ran off of self-booting disks would not work on a PCjr if the software required more than 128k of RAM.

The floppy controller on the PCjr also had its I/O registers mapped into different ports than on the PC, and since the PCjr did not have DMA, the BIOS routines for handling floppy access were different and more complex than those on the PC. Software that tried to perform direct, low-level disk access (mainly utilities, but also the occasional game such as &quot;Dunzhin: Warrior of Ras&quot;) would not work unless it was rewritten for the PCjr.

==History==
IBM&#x27;s first home computer was the PC, released in 1981. Within two years the PC had created a large new ecosystem of hardware and software, nearly leading the home computer market with 26% of all microcomputers sold in 1983, second only to the much less expensive Commodore 64.

For a year before the PCjr&#x27;s announcement, the computer industry discussed rumors of a new IBM product, code named &quot;Peanut&quot;, that would repeat the PC&#x27;s success. The rumors described Peanut as a home computer with of memory that would be IBM PC compatible, benefit from IBM&#x27;s service network and, at to , be less expensive than the Apple IIe. IBM repeatedly denied these rumors, but customers visited stores attempting to buy the product and rivals&#x27; revenue, product plans, and share prices reacted to the officially nonexistent computer in what the press called &quot;Peanut Panic&quot; or &quot;The Great Peanut Roast&quot;.

By September 1983, books and magazine articles on Peanut were ready for publishing, with only a few changes needed once the still officially nonexistent computer appeared. Software companies prepared to market products as &quot;Peanut compatible&quot; with the computer of which, rumors said, IBM would produce 500,000 units in the first year. &quot;Adweek&quot; estimated that IBM would spend on marketing, including an alleged license of Charles Schulz&#x27;s Peanuts characters. &quot;Smalltalk&quot; magazine in August published a detailed article on the computer, stating that it would cost plus for a disk drive, use a color TV as a display, and have a standard typewriter keyboard.

===Announcement===
IBM announced the PCjr on November 1, 1983, at its New York City headquarters with an enormous amount of advance publicity, including live news coverage of the event.

Experts predicted, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, that the PCjr would &quot;quickly become the standard by which all other home computers are measured&quot; and estimated sales of one million or more in 1984, expecting the PCjr to change the home-computer market in a similar way to how the IBM PC had changed the business-microcomputer market. They predicted that the PCjr would extend IBM&#x27;s dominance, with customers able to use the company&#x27;s computers in the home and in the office. Texas Instruments left the market four days before IBM&#x27;s announcement, after losing in nine months against Commodore by selling its 99/4A for as low as .

Developers began creating PCjr software in 1982. Sierra On-Line, SPC, and The Learning Company were among those that produced games, productivity, and educational software as launch titles, using detailed IBM production outlines under a policy of strictly enforced security.

The PCjr&#x27;s graphics and sound features were superior to the PC&#x27;s, and &quot;PC Magazine&quot; speculated that &quot;the PCjr might be the best game machine ever designed&quot;. Prominent among launch titles was Sierra&#x27;s graphical adventure &quot;King&#x27;s Quest I&quot;, much of whose budget was paid by IBM.

=== Release and reception ===
The PCjr was released in March 1984, missing the 1983 Christmas sales season due to production delays.

Even prior to release, anticipation of the machine was mixed. Ziff Davis, publisher of the successful &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, printed the first issue of &quot;PCjr Magazine&quot; before the first units shipped, and competing computer magazines included &quot;Peanut&quot;, &quot;PCjr World&quot;, &quot;jr&quot;, and &quot;Compute! for the PC and PCjr&quot;. However, as new information became available about the machine, retailers became deeply concerned about its marketability.

When the PCjr became widely available in March 1984 sales were below expectations. Consumer interest was reportedly high until demonstration machines were available, at which point interest dropped steeply. Dealers reported that consumers disliked the price, keyboard, and limited memory, and retailers that sold primarily to business customers did not know how to market it.

The press soon reported that the PCjr could embarrass IBM, with executives reportedly worrying about demand. Stores began discounts while vendors slowed plans to release products. IBM admitted that demand for the PCjr was not growing as rapidly as expected. By May 1984 it had only sold 10,000 units, while other companies were reported to be slow in developing software for the system.

In response to the surprising lack of interest, IBM began early discounts of up to in June, lowering the two models&#x27; prices to and , but many of its dealers could not sell their initial shipments of 25 computers each. IBM allowed them to postpone paying for inventory for 180 days, but inventory continued to pile up. By August the PCjr was being described as a flop.

=== Issues ===
One of the most significant complaints about the PCjr was its chiclet keyboard, which was described as unsuitable for serious typing and &quot;nearly useless.&quot; The lack of direct function keys was a pain point for word processing.

==== Cost ====
The PCjr&#x27;s cost was its biggest disadvantage, even more so than the keyboard. The price point was perceived as too high for a home computer, but not powerful enough for a business machine. IBM&#x27;s lack of clear messaging on their target market (home, schools, or executives working at home) made it difficult for software developers, consumers, and dealers to prepare for the product. The price point was perceived as targeting a market that did not exist. IBM was surprised to learn that many of the initial customers for the PCjr were not home users as they assumed, but instead businesses who wanted a cheaper PC that took less space on a desk.

IBM failed to recognize that many consumers wanted a computer more sophisticated than those that cost less than , but did not want to spend more than . The PCjr offered no compelling reason to spend that much. The PCjr cost more than twice as much as the C64 and the Atari 8-bit computers, while inferior to both for videogames. Spinnaker, a game developer, stated that they discontinued development for the PCjr when they learned of the actual price.

Consumers were reportedly much more excited about the also-new Macintosh 128K, which was more sophisticated but only cost more, with accessories and software. The Macintosh reportedly outsold the IBM product during their first two months on the market. The PCjr&#x27;s price was close to that of the Coleco Adam, but the Adam also included a tape drive, a printer, and software. A realistic cost including peripherals was and other configurations cost $3,000 or more.

The IIe was the PCjr&#x27;s most direct competition. Although the PC outsold it Apple sold almost 110,000 units in December 1983, in part to customers who had waited until details of the PCjr became available. Apple estimated that 80% of its dealers sold IBM and Apple computers, and many visitors who were disappointed by the PCjr, or curious about the Macintosh, reportedly left with a IIe instead. The latter was so popular that a shortage occurred in early 1984.

The PCjr model compared favorably to a IIe also with and no floppy drive, but Apple lowered their computer&#x27;s price as part of a &quot;Starter System&quot; package, with monitor and floppy drive, to a price as low as , plus a 30% discount for the important education market. In April 1984 Apple introduced the Apple IIc, a portable version with a more compact form factor, of RAM, and a floppy drive. Although the PCjr&#x27;s CPU was superior, the IIc—which Apple did not describe as a home computer, to avoid the &quot;game machine&quot; connotation—had an excellent keyboard and was compatible with the Apple II&#x27;s enormous software library.

====Compatibility====
By early 1984, PC compatibility was vital for any new, non-Apple computer&#x27;s success. IBM had expected that most customers in the market would be new to computers, but 75% of the market were familiar with computers and wanted to run business software on the PCjr. An important market was executives who took data home to work on applications such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Peanut had been rumored to be fully PC compatible, so many customers visited stores believing that the PCjr could run most PC software.

IBM&#x27;s intent was for the PCjr to be perceived as a unique platform, like most other home computers, and their documentation stated it was &quot;a different computer than the PC&quot;, but with &quot;a high level of programming compatibility.&quot; Nonetheless, potential customers perceived it as a variant of the PC, not a unique platform. While many PC applications would run, specific compatibility issues existed with software that used more than 128K of RAM or required more than one floppy disk drive.

Thousands of PC applications did require more than 128K of memory and two disk drives, making the PCjr incompatible with about 60% of software by some measures, including the popular word-processing program WordStar and Lotus 1-2-3, common applications used to test PC compatibility. IBM&#x27;s own DisplayWrite was released as a unique PCjr version. These compatibility limitations made the computer unsuitable for taking work home, although a PCjr variant of 1-2-3 was eventually released.

Ultimately, the PCjr was perceived as not having a killer app to make up for these limitations. Software incompatibility made it inadequate as a business machine, but poor performance with arcade-style games made it inadequate as a games machine.

====Limited hardware expansion====
Computer dealers quickly identified the PCjr&#x27;s limited hardware expansion capability as another major disadvantage. ROM cartridges had small storage capacity, requiring, for instance, two cartridges and a floppy disk for the PCjr version of Lotus 1-2-3, which also had difficulty fitting complex spreadsheets into 128K of RAM. IBM published technical details for the PCjr as it had done for the IBM PC to encourage third parties to develop accessories, but did not offer a second floppy drive, hard drive, or memory beyond 128 KB.

While multiple sidecar expansion units could be attached, they took up a lot of space, and the computer required additional power supplies to support a second floppy drive or more than one sidecar. IBM advised against adding more than four sidecars. The PCjr also lacks a DMA controller, so the 8088 CPU has to service floppy disk transfers directly, causing the system to momentarily freeze while accessing a disk. The PCjr also cannot use modems faster than 2400 baud.

===Response to poor sales===
By mid-1984, the PCjr had experienced months of bad publicity, and dealers were panicking. Sales were poor and falling each month before rising slightly with the June discounts, and each dealer sold an average of 15 units total in the first half of the year. Apple sold almost as many IIc computers on its first day as PCjr since introduction.

IBM downplayed complaints about the keyboard, but in July announced that it would replace the chiclet keyboards, for free, with a new model with conventional typewriter-style keys. This was perceived as unusually generous even for IBM, especially within the computer industry. By replacing the keyboards IBM was acknowledging the original models were a mistake.

In August 1984, IBM began a massive advertising campaign which ran through the end of the year. They reduced the PCjr&#x27;s list price, offering a US$999 package meant to be superior to the comparably priced Apple IIe and IIc, and they introduced new IBM-made memory expansion options to bring the machine to 512 KB. As part of $32.5 million in advertising for the computer during 1984, it began what the company described as the most extensive marketing campaign in IBM history, in which 98% of Americans would see at least 30 PCjr advertisements in the last four months of the year. Three simultaneous bundled software promotions, a sweepstakes with Procter &amp; Gamble, and direct mail to more than 10 million people marketed the redesigned computer, while deemphasizing the PCjr&#x27;s role as a home computer and emphasizing PC compatibility. Advertisements listed the new price, &quot;new typewriter-style keyboard&quot;, standard 128 KB of memory and expansion options, the PCjr version of 1-2-3, and the ability to &quot;run over a thousand of the most popular programs written for the IBM PC&quot;. A $500 rebate to dealers let them include a free color monitor with the discounted PCjr.

Despite widespread skepticism, what became known as the &quot;Save-the-Junior campaign&quot; succeeded in the short term. Sales rose every month from June (1.9 units sold per store) to September (4.2) and many dealers reported selling more in the weeks following the changes than in the previous seven months. The more expensive model now cost the that had originally been expected prior to release. With the new hardware options and lower prices consumers could buy a PCjr for less than a comparable PC.

The PCjr reportedly became the best-selling computer, outselling the Apple IIe and IIc by four to one in some stores and even the C64. As sales reached an estimated 50 per store in December dealers increased inventories, and Tecmar resumed production of PCjr peripherals after retailers suddenly began ordering its products again.

===Discontinuation===
By January 1985, IBM had sold an estimated 240,000-275,000 PCjrs, 200,000 of which were sold in the fourth quarter of 1984. When the discounts ended, however, sales decreased abruptly and inventories began to stack up again. By this time, three PCjr-specific magazines had ended their publications with significant losses. IBM was unable to meet the demand for its new PC AT business microcomputer, but the home-computer market was in decline and the company was likely unable to make a sufficient profit when selling the PCjr at a discount.

IBM discontinued the PCjr on March 19, 1985, stating that &quot;The home market didn&#x27;t expand to the degree I.B.M. and many observers thought it would&quot;. The surprise decision by IBM&#x27;s CEO John Akers astounded software developers, some of which only made PCjr products. Rumored to have 100,000 to 400,000 unsold PCjrs despite not having ordered new microprocessors from Intel since summer 1984, the company offered large discounts to its employees and consumers. Inventory remained through Christmas 1985, and IBM used discounts as well as radio and full-page print ads to try to sell off remaining stocks.

==Legacy==
The press widely covered the failure of the PCjr. Although the machine&#x27;s failure had little effect on IBM&#x27;s revenue ($46 billion in 1984) discontinuing such a prominent product embarrassed IBM. The failure was so great that it was compared to the Edsel and New Coke, and IBM reportedly created a Chiclet rule, requiring human factors testing for future products.

Some analysts speculated that IBM&#x27;s bureaucratic culture, so different from that of the less-rigid Boca Raton division that created the PC, had resulted in the failure, while others thought that the absence of IBM&#x27;s cautious and thorough bureaucrats had caused it. Don Estridge said their mistake had been to expect that first-time computer users would buy a PCjr. It was perceived by developers that IBM had entered the market without doing any research.

Tandy Corporation released a clone, the Tandy 1000, in November 1984, describing it as &quot;what the PCjr should have been&quot;. After the PCjr&#x27;s discontinuation, Tandy quickly removed any mention of it in advertising, while emphasizing the PC compatibility. The machine and its many successors sold well, unlike the PCjr, partly because the Tandy 1000 was sold in ubiquitous Radio Shack stores and partly because it was less costly, easier to expand, and almost entirely compatible with the IBM PC. The PCjr&#x27;s enhanced graphics and sound standards became known as &quot;Tandy-compatible&quot;, and many PC games advertised their Tandy support. One company developed a PCjr modification that made it compatible with Tandy software.

Ultimately, the PCjrs failure was attributed to its lack of PC compatibility. As PC clones became widely available at prices as low as $600, less than the price of the Apple IIc, consumers began purchasing DOS computers for the home in large numbers, and these inexpensive clones succeeded with consumers where the PCjr had failed, by being as fast as, or faster than the IBM PC while still being highly compatible.

Several upgrades for the PCjr were designed by IBM/Teledyne but never reached store shelves before the PCjr was canceled. These included a wireless joystick and various memory and drive upgrades. PC Enterprises became the last of the major third-party vendors to supply full service, parts, and add-ons, extending the functional life of the PCjr to about 10 years, often buying out inventory and rights for PCjr support.

Other manufacturers provided support items for PCjr fans, such as hard drive attachments and specialized sidecars that the user could use to enhance the system. The PCjr was able to run other software designed for the PC, such as word processor, database and spreadsheet programs ran well on the PCjr with 128K of memory. When fully expanded to over 600K memory, the PCjr would run most IBM PC software.

IBM returned to the home market in 1990 with the PS/1. Unlike the PCjr, the PS/1 offered full PC compatibility, a low price, and a conventional keyboard.

<text>The Roskilde Festival is a Danish music festival held annually south of Roskilde. It is one of the largest music festivals in Europe and the largest in the Nordic countries. It was created in 1971 by two high school students and a promoter. In 1972, the festival was taken over by the Roskilde Foundation, which has since run the festival as a non-profit organization for development and support of music, culture and humanism. In 2014, the Roskilde Foundation provided festival participants with the opportunity to nominate and vote upon which organizations should receive funds raised by the festival.

The Roskilde Festival was Denmark&#x27;s first music-oriented festival created for hippies, and today covers more of the mainstream youth from Scandinavia and the rest of Europe. Most festival visitors are Danes, but there are also many visitors from elsewhere, especially the other Scandinavian countries and Germany.

==History==
===The beginning===
The first Roskilde Festival was held on 28 and 29 August 1971, originally named the Sound Festival. It was created by two high schoolers, Mogens Sandfær and Jesper Switzer Møller, and promoter Carl Fischer. It was inspired by festivals and youth gatherings like Newport, Isle of Wight and Woodstock. It was characterized mainly by poor management but also great enthusiasm. The festival&#x27;s inaugural year saw roughly 20 bands ranging from folk, jazz, rock and pop genres all playing on a single stage, which lasted for two days with some 10,000–13,000 visitors. Because of a lack of time and funds, the two high schoolers withdrew and the next year&#x27;s festival, under the name Fantasy Festival, was arranged by the non-profit Roskilde Foundation and the American folk singer Tony Busch. The foundation had been involved in Roskilde&#x27;s city festival since 1932 and had the necessary contacts. Unlike the first year, the 1972 festival produced a surplus and the foundation was able to donate 50,000 dkk (equalling 330,000 dkk in 2020) to local projects for children and youths. Many volunteers had been involved in the 1972 festival and this, along with being non-profit, would become a hallmark of the future festivals. Since 1973, the Roskilde Foundation (today known as the Roskilde Festival Group) alone has been responsible for arranging the festival.

In 1978, festival organizers acquired the &quot;Canopy Scene&quot;, an orange musical stage previously used by the Rolling Stones on a European tour. Since its beginning, the Canopy Scene and its characteristic arches have become a well-known symbol and logo representing the festival.

===Expansion and professionalization===
By the early 1980s, the festival was large and well-established, but the workload had become unmanageable for an organization of all-volunteers. It was decided that a professional board of directors and people in several other fields were necessary. Nevertheless, the festival remains non-profit and still relies heavily on thousands of volunteers.

From the 1980s, there has been an expansion in the music genres represented at the festival and more stages have been added. They have continued their history of hiring a combination of large international bands, local bands, and up-and-coming bands, like U2 in 1981. In the 1990s, electronic music was introduced to the festival. In 1991, &quot;Club Roskilde&quot; was held, which was an electronic music dance club held in the evenings. In 1995, electronic music artists received their own stage. In the following years, even more room for electronic music was created by the establishment of the chill-out zone and the Roskilde Lounge. Since then, artists like Fatboy Slim, The Prodigy, Basement Jaxx and Chemical Brothers appeared on the main stage.

By the 1990s, the number of tickets offered for sale was restricted and later even reduced. Due to steadily increasing popularity of the festival, the number of visitors had increased to up to 125,000. In addition, 90,000 tickets for about 25,000 volunteers, 5,000 media people and 3,000 artists were added. In order to preserve the quality of the festival, the festival organizers decided to limit the number of participants. The distance from the rearmost part of the camping area to the stages of the festival management seemed to have become unreasonable. The festival had become so popular that the festival management decided in 1994 to expand the festival area to the west, providing more space without increasing distances between the campgrounds and the concert venues. The festival site was now divided by the small railway line into two parts. In 1995 the festival inaugurated its own train station, which facilitates the arrival of visitors. In 1997, another tent called &quot;Roskilde Ballroom&quot; was built. If Roskilde Festival visitors are included in the population of Roskilde, it is the fourth-largest city in Denmark.

In the 2000s, there has been an increasing focus on the footprint of the festival. In 2017, 90 percent of the food sold in food stalls at the festival was organic and a container-deposit system (expanded compared to the one that already exists in Denmark) has been introduced, which resulted in more than eight million items being returned in that year&#x27;s festival alone. There are programs for efficient waste sorting, increase of recycling levels, and a reduction of the amount of garbage produced. A partnership with DSB has resulted in more direct train links between the Copenhagen Central Station and the Roskilde Festival station, making it easier to reach by public transport.

==Stages==


The bands presented at Roskilde Festival are traditionally a balanced mix of large, well-known artists, cutting-edge artists from all contemporary genres, popular crowd-pleasing acts plus local Scandinavian headliners and up-and-coming names.

The stages were until 2003 named after their colour, but as the names had not matched the actual color of the tents for a period, it was decided to rename all stages except the Orange Stage, the central and main stage. The Orange Stage is open in front of a huge field, whereas the other tents cover the whole audience, the largest of which is the Arena stage (formerly known as Green Stage), the largest tent in Europe with an official capacity of 17,000 people. The 2007 edition saw two new tents, replacing Ballroom (1997–2006) which presented mainly World music, and Metropol (2003–2006) which presented mainly Electronica. In 2010 two stages, Astoria (from 2007) and Lounge, did not return, due to a slight shift in focus towards fewer, but bigger bands. In 2014 the Odeon stage was cancelled along with the surrounding sustainable-style food outlets, and the area was replaced with pre-booked tents for festival guests that prefer not to bring their own.

The music covers such styles as rock, Hip Hop, Metal, urban, electronica and 3rd world contemporary music. It has become a tradition to let a Danish act open the Orange Stage on the first day of the festival. There are often surprising performances by classical acts, film-music, opera etc.

Apart from music there is always some theatre and &#x27;lone acts&#x27; wandering around the festival site. Terrain and tents are always decorated in various ways. The current tents are:

==Campsite==
The festival campsite covers nearly and access to it is included in the ticket price. It usually opens on Saturday afternoon prior to the festival itself. Apart from the small and separate &quot;Camping South&quot; it is divided into two areas, &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot;, each comprising a service center with establishments ranging from food stalls to a cinema. The campsite is further divided into &#x27;agoras&#x27; that provide toilets, cell phone charging, and luggage storage. They also host events according to each agora&#x27;s theme.

As of 2018, a new gate system has been installed. This means that all guests arriving first fill 7 rows of the gate system (1000 people in each). Behind this, a large field holding all remaining guests. At 16:00 on the opening Saturday, the gates open, one row at a time at approx 90sec intervals. Once this is complete, the remaining guests in the back area are free to enter the camping area. The concert sites only opens the following day.

Every year since 1999, on the Saturday of the festival (held on a Thursday in 2015, 2016 and 2017), Roskilde Festival Radio organizes a naked run in a fenced-in track around the camp site. One male and one female winner receive a ticket for the next year&#x27;s festival. The run has subsequently become a very popular and &quot;legendary&quot; part of the festival.

==Newspaper==
The &quot;Orange Press&quot; (named after the main stage) was a newspaper that specifically dealt with events relevant to the festival. First published in 2008, it was made by more than 70 journalists, photographers and music reviewers. It was published daily during the festival and available online and on-site for free until its last issue in 2022. The festival has since decided to focus more on digital communication.

==Specific years==
=== Overview 1971–present ===
=== 2000 crush=== 

During Pearl Jam&#x27;s concert at the Orange Stage on 30 June 2000, a crowd crush occurred. Nine people died, and twenty-six people were injured, three of them seriously. The dead, all male, were a 26-year-old German, a 23-year-old Dutchman, a 24-year-old Australian (who died a few days later in a hospital), three Swedes, two aged 22 and one 20, and three Danes, one aged 22 and two aged 17.

The concert began late in the evening around 22:30 CET and had an audience of about 50,000, a fairly typical size for large concerts at this stage. About half an hour after the concert began, many people fell down at one place, primarily due to a series of wave-like motions in the audience, which were the result of some trying to get closer to the stage. When they did not immediately get up, others were pushed over them and crowd surfers fell into this &quot;hole&quot; that was a few metres in size. The people at the bottom died of asphyxiation, likely within five minutes. On the day of the incident, there was also heavy rainfall, which could have contributed to the ground being slippery.

Most people who fell were at a location not far from the stage, but initially not easily seen and out of easy reach for the security guards because of the dense crowd. Some of the concertgoers who were lifted over the barrier at the stage told the security about the seriousness of the situation further back. The band was informed and stopped the music, and told the crowd to step back. This had some effect, but it still took several more minutes before it was possible to get all the victims.

The victims were taken to the adjacent medical tent where they were treated by nurses and doctors, but for some it was already too late. The victims needing further medical treatment were subsequently transferred by ambulances to Roskilde Hospital, about from the concert site. None of the people who died were under the influence of drugs and none were heavily impaired by alcohol. In the area where the main fall happened, several women had been helped out earlier because they were nervous about the pushing and crowd surfers; this might explain why all the people who died were men. Because of the large size of the concert, some concertgoers only realized how serious it had been after they had left the venue.

Other bands at Roskilde cancelled their performances, whereas D.A.D. (the unofficial &quot;house band&quot; of the festival), which already was scheduled to hold the festival&#x27;s final concert, decided to change it into a sensitive memorial concert for the people who had not yet left the festival. The incident was examined separately by police, public prosecutors, and subsequent civil trials, all of which determined that it was accidental and that there had been no criminal actions, although the response time from when the people fell over until they were rescued was criticized.

Before this, there had not been major incidents at Roskilde and it was generally considered a very safe festival. Following a detailed review, several new measures were implemented such as a larger safety area with extra emergency exits in front of the stage, more &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;soft&quot; systems to control the number of people allowed into each concert, more spacing and clear separation between audience sections with separate entrances/exits, an expanded video surveillance system making it easier to detect potential problems early, more guards among the audience, an emergency system where the safety staff can shut down the entire concert at the push of a single button, and the chain-of-command was strengthened. Each year, the Roskilde Festival performs a new safety review. A safety network of European festivals and concerts, along with experts, was started (the &quot;YES Group&quot;) and many of the measures introduced in Roskilde have later been added elsewhere. As crowd surfing seems to have been among the precipitating factors, it was subsequently forbidden at many festivals in Europe. In part because of the accident at Roskilde, Glastonbury Festival in the United Kingdom was cancelled in 2001 to implement extra safety measures.

Pearl Jam&#x27;s song &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot; references the tragedy with the line &quot;Lost nine friends we&#x27;ll never know... two years ago today.&quot; When performed in concert, lead singer Eddie Vedder modifies the lyric to reflect the passage of time since the tragedy. Before the opening of the 2001 festival, a memorial to those killed in 2000 containing a stone with the inscription &quot;How fragile we are&quot; (a quote from the Sting song &quot;Fragile&quot;) surrounded by nine trees had been made. At the official opening of the 2010 festival (the 10-year anniversary), Patti Smith held the short pre-concert ceremony, and she chose to open the tribute with accompanying music from Mozart. Her lead guitarist, Lenny Kaye, then read out the nine men&#x27;s names while Smith threw nine roses into the crowd.

With only one day of rain and the rest of the week being sunny, this festival also ranks as one with lucky weather conditions. Changes from the previous year included a new swimming lake – which proved to be very successful due to the warm and sunny weather – and a lounge stage called &quot;Bar&#x27;n&quot;. Some of the performing artists were Bob Dylan, Immortal Technique, Roger Waters, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Tool, The Strokes, Deftones, Morrissey, Franz Ferdinand, Kanye West, Placebo, Bullet for My Valentine, Arctic Monkeys, Sigur Rós and The Streets.

The opening of Orange Stage was done by Danish Veto, and was closed by Kings of Leon.

<doc id="284545" wikidata="Q846750" url="?curid=284545" title="Jockey">
<text>A jockey is someone who rides horses in horse racing or steeplechase racing, primarily as a profession. The word also applies to camel riders in camel racing. The word &quot;jockey&quot; originated from England and was used to describe the individual who rode horses in racing. They must be light, typically around a weight of 100–120 lb. (45–55 kg), and physically fit. They are typically self-employed, and are paid a small fee from the horse trainer, whose colors they wear while competing in a race. They also receive a percentage of the horse&#x27;s winnings. The job has a very high risk of debilitating or life-threatening injuries, not only from racing accidents but also, because of strict weight restrictions, from eating disorders. 

Originally, in most countries, the jockeys were all male. Over time, female jockeys have been allowed to ride; thus, now there are many successful and well-known female jockeys. The participation of African American jockeys has also had a complex history.

==Etymology==
The word is by origin a diminutive of &quot;jock&quot;, the Northern English or Scots colloquial equivalent of the first name &quot;John&quot;, which is also used generically for &quot;boy&quot; or &quot;fellow&quot; (compare &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Dick&quot;), at least since 1529. A familiar instance of the use of the word as a name is in &quot;Jockey of Norfolk&quot; in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot;. v. 3, 304.

In the 16th and 17th centuries the word was applied to horse-dealers, postilions, itinerant minstrels and vagabonds, and thus frequently bore the meaning of a cunning trickster, a &quot;sharp&quot;, whence the verb &quot;to jockey&quot;, &quot;to outwit&quot;, or &quot;to do&quot; a person out of something. The current meaning of a person who rides a horse in races was first seen in 1670. Polly Adler also used &quot;jock&quot; as shorthand for &quot;jockey&quot; in her 1953 book, &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot;.

==Physical characteristics==
Jockeys must be light to ride at the weights which are assigned to their mounts. There are horse carrying weight limits that are set by racing authorities. The Kentucky Derby, for example, has a weight limit of including the jockey&#x27;s equipment. The weight of a jockey racing on the flat usually ranges from . Despite their light weight, they must be able to control a horse that is moving at and weighs . Though there is no height limit for jockeys, they are usually fairly short due to the weight limits.

Jockeys racing on the flat typically stand around to . Jump jockeys are often taller, with multiple examples over . Lester Piggott, considered one of the greatest flat jockeys, was nicknamed &quot;Longfellow&quot; for his height of , and Jack Andrews, who is , can ride at a weight of . Bruce Hobbs was at the tallest jockey ever to win the Grand National.

==Role==
Jockeys are normally self employed, nominated by horse trainers to ride their horses in races, for a fee (which is paid regardless of the prize money the horse earns for a race) and a percentage of the purse winnings. In Australia, employment of apprentice jockeys is in terms of indenture to a master (a trainer); and there is a clear employee-employer relationship. When an apprentice jockey finishes their apprenticeship and becomes a &quot;fully fledged jockey&quot;, the nature of their employment and insurance requirements change because they are regarded as &quot;freelance&quot;, like contractors. Jockeys often cease their riding careers to take up other employment in racing, usually as trainers. In this way the apprenticeship system serves to induct young people into racing employment.
Jockeys usually start out when they are young, exercising horses in the morning for trainers, and entering the riding profession as apprentice jockeys. It is normally necessary for an apprentice jockey to ride a minimum of about 20 barrier trials successfully before being permitted to ride in races. An apprentice jockey is known as a &quot;bug boy&quot; because the asterisk that follows the name in the program looks like a bug. All jockeys must be licensed and usually are not permitted to bet on a race. An apprentice jockey has a master, who is a horse trainer, and the apprentice is also allowed to &quot;claim&quot; weight off the horse&#x27;s back: in handicapped races, more experienced riders will have their horses given an extra amount of weight to carry, whereas a jockey in their apprenticeship will have less weight on their horse, giving trainers an incentive to hire these less-experienced jockeys. This weight allowance is adjusted according to the number of winners that the apprentice has ridden. After a four-year indentured apprenticeship, the apprentice becomes a senior jockey and usually develops relationships with trainers and individual horses. Sometimes senior jockeys are paid a retainer by an owner which gives the owner the right to insist the jockey ride their horses in races.

Racing modeled on the English Jockey Club spread throughout the world with colonial expansion.

== Racing colours == 
The colours worn by jockeys in races are the registered &quot;colours&quot; of the owner or trainer who employs them. The practice of riders wearing colours probably stems from medieval times when jousts were held between knights. However, the origins of racing colours of various patterns may have been influenced by racing held in Italian city communities since medieval times. Purple, gold and or yellow/nude, Such traditional events are still held on town streets and are known for furious riding and the colorful spectacle they offer.

While the term &quot;silks&quot; is used in the United States to refer to racing colours, technically &quot;silks&quot; are the white breeches and bib, stock or cravat. Obtaining them is a rite of passage when a jockey is first able to don silken pants and colors in their first race ride. At one time silks were invariably made of silk chosen for being a lightweight fabric, though now synthetics are used instead. Silks and their colours are important symbols of loyalty and festivity.

Many of the silks bear chequered patterns, polka dots, stripes or icons such as quatrefoils. The wearing of silks originated in the United Kingdom. They were first mentioned in 1515, and the current system was formally established in the 1700s. Horses are identified as they race by the colourful, traditional silk shirts and helmets their jockeys wear, these representing the horses&#x27; owners. The colours need to be significantly different to serve this purpose and are registered by each Australian state&#x27;s Principal Racing Authority (PRA). 
The silks of famous jockeys, horses and owners can fetch high prices at auction, suggesting the esteem in which history and tradition are held in horse racing. Although Racing Australia requires that all jockeys wear approved helmets and safety vests, racegoers are unaware of this latter safety equipment as it is worn beneath the silks. Jockeys also wear a &#x27;skivvy&#x27; under the silks. On race days the skivvy chosen is a lightweight mesh or microfibre bodysuit, sleeved or sleeveless, whereas, for track work, a more heavy-duty version may be worn. Summarising, during an Australian race day, jockeys must wear the following: the helmet (or skullcap), goggles, silks, vest, breeches, gloves, boots, saddle and girth and stirrups.

==Awards==
Various awards are given annually to jockeys by organizations affiliated with the sport of thoroughbred racing in countries throughout the world. They include:

*Australia
**Scobie Breasley Medal
*Canada
** Avelino Gomez Memorial Award
*United Kingdom
** Lester Award
** Champion Flat Jockey Award
** Champion Jump Jockey Award
*United States
** George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award
** Isaac Murphy Award

==Risk factors==
Horse racing is a sport where jockeys may incur permanent, debilitating, and even life-threatening injuries. Chief among them include concussion, bone fractures, arthritis, trampling, and paralysis. Jockey insurance premiums remain among the highest of all professional sports. Between 1993 and 1996, 6,545 injuries occurred during official races for an injury rate of 606 per 1,000 jockey years. In Australia race riding is regarded as being the second most deadly job, after offshore fishing. From 2002 to 2006 five deaths and 861 serious injuries were recorded.

Eating disorders (such as anorexia) are also very common among jockeys, as they face extreme pressure to maintain unusually low (and specific) weights, sometimes within a five-pound (2.3 kg) margin. The bestselling biography, &quot;&quot; chronicled the eating disorders of jockeys living in the first half of the twentieth century. As in the cases of champion jockey Kieren Fallon and Robert Winston, the pressure to stay light has been blamed in part for jockeys suffering agonies of thirst from dehydration while racing. Sports Dietitians Australia warns: &quot;Dehydration and energy depletion may compromise concentration and coordination.&quot; Indeed, recent research carried out in association with the Irish Turf Club measured the effects of rapid weight loss to make weight in professional and apprentice jockeys and found significant levels of dehydration; however, cognitive function was maintained, suggesting jockeys had become accustomed to performing in a dehydrated state and had potentially developed a preventative mechanism to enable them to perform under these conditions.

In January 2016 it was announced that the International Concussion and Head Injury Research Foundation (ICHIRF) will run a new study. Named &#x27;Concussion in Sport&#x27; it will be the first study to take a detailed look at the effects of concussion on sports people, including on around 200 retired jockeys.

==Female jockeys==
Based on American statistics, women comprise only 14% of working jockeys, and ride only 10% of all race starts.

===Australia===
During the 1850s, women-only horse-racing events were held in Victoria, Australia; women were not permitted to ride as professional jockeys or on professional tracks with men.

Although women jockeys were barred from riding at registered race meetings, in the mid-1900s Wilhemena Smith rode as Bill Smith at north Queensland racecourses. She was nicknamed Bill &quot;Girlie&quot; Smith because she arrived on course with her riding gear on under her clothes and did not shower on course. It was only at the time of her death in 1975 that the racing world was officially told that Bill was really Wilhemena. Subsequent inquiries proved that William Smith was actually a woman who had been born Wilhemena Smith in a Sydney hospital in 1886. In an era when women were clearly denied equality, she had become known as a successful jockey in Queensland country districts as &#x27;Bill Smith&#x27;. Elizabeth Williams Berry rode in Melbourne and internationally, disguised as a boy and using the name, Jack Williams.

During the late 1960s, restrictions against female trainers were lifted in Australia, but female jockeys were still confined to &quot;ladies only&quot; events, which were held on non-professional tracks. The Victoria Racing Club in 1974 permitted women jockeys to be registered for professional &quot;ladies only&quot; events. In 1978, racing rules in New Zealand were amended to permit women jockeys.

In the late 1970s, pioneers such as Pam O&#x27;Neill in Australia and Linda Jones from New Zealand forced jockey club officials to grant women the right to compete on an equal footing in registered races against men. They were unquestionably the first women jockeys to be licensed to ride in the metropolitan areas of Australia. Previously women had been riding against men in Australia at the unregistered &quot;all-height&quot; meetings. Pam created a world record for any jockey, male or female, when she rode a treble at Southport on her first day&#x27;s riding.
Australia&#x27;s top woman jockey, Bev Buckingham, became the first woman in the Southern Hemisphere to win 1,000 races. In 1998, in a fall at the Elwick Racecourse (Hobart), she broke her neck. She used a wheelchair for some time afterward, but regained her strength and mobility and was able to walk again without assistance.

In 2004–05, Clare Lindop won the Adelaide jockeys&#x27; premiership and became the first woman to win a metropolitan jockeys&#x27; premiership in mainland Australia. In 2005, Andrea Leek became the first woman to ride the winner of the Grand National Hurdle (4,300 m) at Flemington when she won aboard Team Heritage.
In 2009 it was reported women account for 17% of jockeys in Victoria. But, they receive only 10% of the rides, and are often overlooked in favour of male jockeys, especially in the cities. In some regions of Australia about half of the apprentice jockey intakes are women.

In January 2015 at Mount Gambier, South Australia, all eight races on the card were won by women jockeys: Emily Finnegan (3 wins), Clare Lindop (2), Holly McKechnie (2) and Chelsea Jokic (1).

Michelle Payne became the first female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup on 3 November 2015.

===Great Britain and Ireland===
Women were initially banned from racing under Jockey Club rules in Britain, though records indicate that women rode, disguised as men, as early as 1804. In the Victorian era, Elizabeth Williams Berry of Australia, noted above, came to England and rode disguised as a man, continuing to use the name Jack Williams. To help her disguise, she smoked cigars and wore a bowler hat. In the 20th century, after many years of debate, a series of a dozen races was approved for female jockeys in 1972. Meriel Patricia Tufnell overcame childhood disability to ride the novice Scorched Earth to victory in the first race, the Goya Stakes at Kempton Park on 6 May 1972. In 1976 Valerie Greaves became the first amateur woman to &quot;beat professionals under Rules&quot; at Hexham Racecourse. In September, 1978, Karen Wiltshire, age 22, won a Salisbury handicap on The Goldstone, making her the first woman professional jockey to ride a winner in a British flat race. In 2024, Wiltshire published an account of the prejudice she had to deal with as a woman jockey in the 1970s. In 1996, Alex Greaves, the daughter of Valerie Greaves, became the first woman to ride in the Epsom Dash in Epsom Derby&#x27;s 216-year history. 

The first decade of the 21st century saw the profile of women jockeys rise considerably in British Flat racing. In 2005 Hayley Turner became Champion Apprentice rider, before becoming the first woman to ride 100 winners in a British season in 2008. Also in 2008, Kirsty Milczarek became the first woman to ride three winners at a single British race meeting, at Kempton in February. Milczarek rode 71 winners that year. This period saw the total number of female jockeys in British Flat racing rise significantly. Two further female jockeys have won the apprentice championship since Turner – Amy Ryan in 2012 and Josephine Gordon in 2016. This change has not applied in National Hunt racing, though amateur riders Nina Carberry and Katie Walsh (sister of Ruby Walsh) have gained success in Ireland and ridden winners at the Cheltenham Festival. In the 2010 National Hunt Chase at the Cheltenham Festival the winner and runner-up were both ridden by female jockeys. Katie Walsh was on board Poker de Sivola finishing ahead of Becauseicouldntsee which was ridden by Nina Carberry.

On Boxing Day 2015 Lizzie Kelly became the first female jockey to win a grade one race in Britain, on Tea For Two in the Kauto Star Novices&#x27; Chase at Kempton Park. Lizzie Kelly won another grade 1 in 2017. It was the Betway Bowl at the Grand National Festival, on Tea For Two. In the 2016/17 season Rachael Blackmore became the first female jockey to win the Irish Conditional Jockeys title. In 2018 Lizzie Kelly became the first female professional jockey to ride a winner at the Cheltenham Festival. She rode Coo Star Sivola in the Ultima handicap chase. In 2019 Bryony Frost became the first female jockey to ride a grade 1 winner at the Cheltenham Festival. She rode Frodon in the Ryanair Chase. In 2021, Rachael Blackmore became the first female jockey to win the Grand National, the most valuable jump race in Europe. The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) has set about encouraging the women who make up three quarters of the graduates from the two principal racing schools in the UK to stay in the profession as jockeys.

===New Zealand===

In Thoroughbred racing in New Zealand women constitute over 40% of jockeys.

The first win by a woman in New Zealand was visiting Canadian jockey Joan Phipps, at Te Awamutu in November 1977.

Linda Jones is believed to be the first New Zealand woman to apply for an apprentice&#x27;s licence, however she was turned down. She had ridden in a number of lady riders events over many years in New Zealand and overseas such as in Brazil, which highlighted that New Zealand and Australia were outliers in not allowing women to compete with male jockeys in professional races. She persevered and the New Zealand Racing Conference eventually accepted female jockeys. They became eligible to ride on 15 July 1978 with the first New Zealand woman to ride in a totalisator race in New Zealand being Joanne Hale (Giles) on that day at Waimate. Sue Day (Christchurch), Joanne Lamond (Oamaru) and Vivienne Kaye (Awapuni) also rode in later races on that same day.

Sue Day became the first New Zealand female jockey winner in a totalisator race against males on 22 July 1978 when she won with the Ned Thistoll-trained Jaws in the Waybrook Handicap at Timaru. Another female jockey riding then was Cherie Saxon (Hastings).

Linda Jones&#x27; first win was on Big Bickies at Te Rapa and soon after she won with Royal Petite, the first Open Handicap winner for a female jockey. Subsequent highlight wins for Jones were Lovaro in the Queen Elizabeth Handicap and Holy Toledo in the Wellington Derby on 22 January 1979 (possibly the first female jockey world-wide to win a Derby). Jones was also the first female jockey to win a professional race against males at a registered meeting in Australia, winning aboard Pay The Purple in the Labour Day Cup at Doomben Racecourse, Brisbane on May 7, 1979.

In 1982 Maree Lyndon was the first female jockey to win a Group I race in New Zealand when winning the New Zealand Cup on Sirtain.

In 1986 Trudy Thornton became the first woman jockey to ride in New Zealand&#x27;s longest thoroughbred race, the Great Northern Steeplechase. In 1995, Tina Egan was the first woman to win the race.

In 1997 Catherine Hutchinson (née Tremayne) was the first female jockey to ride six winners in a day, which she did at Ruakaka.

In 2005 and 2006 Lisa Cropp won the New Zealand jockeys&#x27; premierships. In recent years the New Zealand jockeys premiership has been won by Lisa Allpress (2012, 2016, 2019 and 2020), Samantha Collett (2018) and Danielle Johnson (2021).

In April 2017 at Timaru eight of the nine races on the card were won by women jockeys: Alysha Collett, Kylie Williams, Tina Comignaghi, Amanda Morgan and Samantha Wynne.

On 10 October 2019 at Tauherenikau Racecourse all eight races were won by women riders: Rosie Myers (4 races), Lisa Allpress (2), Charlotte O&#x27;Beirne (A) and Leah Mischewski.

===United States and Canada===
Eliza Carpenter (1851 – 1924) was an early African-American race horse owner. In Ponca City, Oklahoma, she trained horses for racing, becoming one of the few African-American stable owners in the West. When dissatisfied with the way a race was going, she sometimes would ride her own horses as a jockey, winning some races. Recorded names of her horses include &quot;Irish Maid&quot;, &quot;Blue Bird&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Rain&quot;, &quot;Sam Carpenter&quot;, and &quot;Little Brown Jug&quot;, the last of which she reportedly raced at Tijuana, Baja California.

Anna Lee Aldred (1921 – 2006) was given a license at age 18 in 1939 at Agua Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, Mexico, when officials were unable to find a rule that would bar women jockeys and she finished second by a nose in her first professional race. Hollywood stuntwoman Alice Van-Springsteen (1918 – 2008) also rode as a jockey and was one of the first women ever to receive a trainer&#x27;s license for Thoroughbred horses.

Wantha Davis (1918 – 2012) was known to have won over 1,000 races in the 1930s, 40s and 50s, including a famous 1949, six furlong match-race against Johnny Longden at Agua Caliente. She rode at some state-sanctioned pari-mutuel tracks, but without a license, most events were of the dusty county fair and half-mile variety of the western circuit. Even though she was always in demand as a training jockey, her applications for a license were turned down in state after state.

Twelve years after Davis retired, the &quot;modern era of female jockeys&quot; began when Olympic equestrian and show jumping competitor Kathy Kusner, who had also ridden as a jockey, successfully sued the Maryland Racing Commission for a jockey&#x27;s license in 1967 under the Civil Rights Act. She won her case in 1968 and became one of the earliest women to be licensed in the United States, though an injury prevented her from racing at the time. In late 1968, Penny Ann Early was the first woman to earn a mount as a licensed Thoroughbred jockey in the U.S., when she entered three races at Churchill Downs in November, but the male jockeys announced a boycott of those races, and so she could not ride. On 7 February 1969, Diane Crump was the first licensed woman rider to ride in a parimutuel Thoroughbred race in the United States at the Hialeah Park Race Track in Florida. She required a police escort to get to the paddock. Two weeks later, on 22 February at Charles Town in West Virginia, Barbara Jo Rubin became the first woman to win a race, and went on to win 11 of her first 22. Others soon followed suit and over the years American women jockeys have proven their ability. Julie Krone&#x27;s 3,704 victories is the most by an American woman and , at least nineteen others have each ridden more than 1,000 winners.

For the most part Canada has generally followed the lead of the U.S. in opportunities for women riders. Canada has far fewer tracks than the U.S. and to date Canada has only two female jockeys with 1,000 wins. However, in both actual and relative numbers as well as overall success rate, Canada has surpassed its southern neighbor in opportunities for women at the highest level; their respective Triple Crown series: Starting with Joan Phipps in the 1973 Breeders&#x27; Stakes, 10 different women have competed in 30 Canadian Triple Crown races, with a combined 2 wins, 3 places, 4 shows. Moreover, while no US Triple Crown race has ever featured more than one female rider, that feat has occurred on 10 occasions in Canada, and 3 different women—Francine Villeneuve, Chantal Sutherland and Emma-Jayne Wilson—have raced in all three Canadian races. Sutherland has done it twice over and Wilson thrice over.

By comparison, since Diane Crump rode in the 1970 Kentucky Derby, six different women have competed in U.S. Triple Crown events, some multiple times: 10 times in the Derby, four times in the Preakness and nine times in the Belmont. with a combined record of one win, one place, one show. Julie Krone is the only woman to have won a US Triple Crown race, on Colonial Affair in the 1993 Belmont. With appearances in the 2011 Kentucky Derby, the 2012 Belmont Stakes and the 2013 Preakness Stakes, Rosie Napravnik became the first woman to ride in all three of the U.S. Triple Crown races. In 2013, Napravnik also became the first woman to ride in all three US Triple Crown races in the same year, and is the only woman to have won the Kentucky Oaks, which she has won twice.
==Robot jockeys==
To replace child jockeys whose use had been deplored by human rights organizations, a camel race in Doha, Qatar, for the first time featured robots at the reins. On 13 July 2005, workers fixed robotic jockeys on the backs of seven camels and raced the machine-mounted animals around a track. Operators controlled the jockeys remotely, signalling them to pull their reins and prod the camels with whips.

==Early history of African American jockeys==

In North America during the 1800s, most aspects of horse racing were primarily performed by enslaved African Americans. Plantation owners would bring thei enslaved workers and their horses to other plantations and organize and bet on races. When horse racing became more mainstream, enslaved and free black people were involved with horse racing though most were identified with grooming, feeding, backing, exercising, and other auxiliary chores connected with the sport. Then they would work their way up to trainers, and then become full-time racers. By the end of the 1800s, horse racing was almost exclusively run by African American jockeys. The three most successful black jockeys being Isaac Murphy, Willie Simms, and Jimmy Winkfield, with Murphy winning the Kentucky Derby in 1884, 1887, and 1890. This dominance of the sport by African Americans came to an abrupt stop in 1896 when &quot;Plessy vs. Ferguson&quot; was decided, basically legalizing segregation. This led to the end of the supremacy of African American jockeys.

<text>An RF probe is a device which allows electronic test equipment to measure radio frequency (RF) signal in an electronic circuit.

==History==
In 1980 Reed Gleason and Eric Strid invented the first high frequency wafer probe while working at Tektronix. They later went on to found Cascade Microtech in 1983.

RF energy may be challenging to measure for one or more reasons, depending on the nature of the circuit to be measured and the measuring equipment at hand.

The first kind of difficulty arises when the RF energy to be measured is at a frequency too high for available test equipment, such as a low-bandwidth oscilloscope, to process directly. In that case, the RF has to be converted to a DC or near-DC signal.

In this situation, a simple probe type sometimes called an RF detector can be used to convert the RF signal to DC. Such device will work as a RF rectifier and give a pulsed DC voltage.

The second kind of difficulty arises when RF energy has to be measured in a circuit which is sensitive to small changes in its electrical environment. For example, with some oscillator circuits, the presence of an ordinary wire within a few centimeters of the active components may change the amplitude or frequency of oscillations, or even prevent the circuit from oscillating at all. In that case, the signal has to be acquired by a measurement probe which extracts very little energy from the circuit. This can be achieved by employing very thin conductors, or tiny coils kept at some minimum separation from the active elements of the circuit.

In a situation, where circuit loading rather than high frequency is the real problem, a variety of small-geometry, high impedance probes can be used, sometimes including an amplifier to boost the tiny amount of energy extracted from the circuit to a level that allows it to be measured by available high-frequency test equipment.

Coaxial structures with spring-loaded inner and outer conductors can serve as an RF probe for modern communication electronics. Such probes are for instance being used in mass-production, in-line testing of communication electronics such as mobile phone industry. RF probes are especially relevant for switches and RF traces in printed circuit boards as well as terminations of RF components. In such systems, like many other RF circuits, there is a higher requirement of matching probe impedance with that of the DUT. Efficient matching avoids reflection which in turn leads to efficient power transfer. The second challenge to keep the power transfer efficient, is to keep the insertion loss as low as possible. Optimizing these parameters generally gets more challenging as the frequency increases.

<text>Brahmi ( ; ; ISO: &quot;Brāhmī&quot;) is a writing system from ancient India that appeared as a fully developed script in the 3rd century BCE. Its descendants, the Brahmic scripts, continue to be used today across South and Southeastern Asia.

Brahmi is an abugida and uses a system of diacritical marks to associate vowels with consonant symbols. The writing system only went through relatively minor evolutionary changes from the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE) down to the early Gupta period (4th century CE), and it is thought that as late as the 4th century CE, a literate person could still read and understand Mauryan inscriptions. Sometime thereafter, the ability to read the original Brahmi script was lost. The earliest (indisputably dated) and best-known Brahmi inscriptions are the rock-cut edicts of Ashoka in north-central India, dating to 250–232 BCE.

The decipherment of Brahmi became the focus of European scholarly attention in the early 19th-century during East India Company rule in India, in particular in the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta. Brahmi was deciphered by James Prinsep, the secretary of the Society, in a series of scholarly articles in the Society&#x27;s journal in the 1830s. His breakthroughs built on the epigraphic work of Christian Lassen, Edwin Norris, H. H. Wilson and Alexander Cunningham, among others.

The origin of the script is still much debated, with most scholars stating that Brahmi was derived from or at least influenced by one or more contemporary Semitic scripts. Some scholars favour the idea of an indigenous origin or connection to the much older and as yet undeciphered Indus script but the evidence is insufficient at best.

Brahmi was at one time referred to in English as the &quot;pin-man&quot; script, likening the characters to stick figures. It was known by a variety of other names, including &quot;lath&quot;, &quot;Laṭ&quot;, &quot;Southern Aśokan&quot;, &quot;Indian Pali&quot; or &quot;Mauryan&quot; , until the 1880s when Albert Étienne Jean Baptiste Terrien de Lacouperie, based on an observation by Gabriel Devéria, associated it with the Brahmi script, the first in a list of scripts mentioned in the &quot;Lalitavistara Sūtra&quot;. Thence the name was adopted in the influential work of Georg Bühler, albeit in the variant form &quot;Brahma&quot;.

The Gupta script of the 5th century is sometimes called &quot;Late Brahmi&quot;. From the 6th century onward, the Brahmi script diversified into numerous local variants, grouped as the Brahmic family of scripts. Dozens of modern scripts used across South and South East Asia have descended from Brahmi, making it one of the world&#x27;s most influential writing traditions. One survey found 198 scripts that ultimately derive from it.

Among the inscriptions of Ashoka () written in the Brahmi script a few numerals were found, which have come to be called the Brahmi numerals. The numerals are additive and multiplicative and, therefore, not place value; it is not known if their underlying system of numeration has a connection to the Brahmi script. But in the second half of the 1st millennium CE, some inscriptions in India and Southeast Asia written in scripts derived from the Brahmi did include numerals that are decimal place value, and constitute the earliest existing material examples of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, now in use throughout the world. The underlying system of numeration, however, was older, as the earliest attested orally transmitted example dates to the middle of the 3rd century CE in a Sanskrit prose adaptation of a lost Greek work on astrology.
==Texts==
The Brahmi script is mentioned in the ancient Indian texts of the three major Dharmic religions: Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism, as well as their Chinese translations. For example, the 10th chapter of the &quot;Lalitavistara Sūtra&quot; (c. 200–300 CE), titled the &quot;Lipisala samdarshana parivarta,&quot; lists 64 &quot;lipi&quot; (scripts), with the Brahmi script starting the list. The &quot;Lalitavistara Sūtra&quot; states that young Siddhartha, the future Gautama Buddha (~500 BCE), mastered philology, Brahmi and other scripts from the Brahmin Lipikāra and Deva Vidyāsiṃha at a school.

A list of eighteen ancient scripts is found in the early Jaina texts, such as the &quot;Paṇṇavaṇā Sūtra&quot; (2nd century BCE) and the &quot;Samavāyāṅga Sūtra&quot; (3rd century BCE). These Jain script lists include Brahmi at number 1 and Kharoṣṭhi at number 4, but also Javanaliya (probably Greek) and others not found in the Buddhist lists.

==Origins==

While the contemporary Kharoṣṭhī script is widely accepted to be a derivation of the Aramaic alphabet, the genesis of the Brahmi script is less straightforward. Salomon reviewed existing theories in 1998, while Falk provided an overview in 1993.

Early theories proposed a pictographic-acrophonic origin for the Brahmi script, on the model of the Egyptian hieroglyphic script. These ideas however have lost credence, as they are &quot;purely imaginative and speculative&quot;. Similar ideas have tried to connect the Brahmi script with the Indus script, but they remain unproven, and particularly suffer from the fact that the Indus script is as yet undeciphered.
The mainstream view is that Brahmi has an origin in Semitic scripts (usually Aramaic). This is accepted by the vast majority of script scholars since the publications by Albrecht Weber (1856) and Georg Bühler&#x27;s &quot;On the origin of the Indian Brahma alphabet&quot; (1895). Bühler&#x27;s ideas have been particularly influential, though even by the 1895 date of his opus on the subject, he could identify no fewer than five competing theories of the origin, one positing an indigenous origin and the others deriving it from various Semitic models.

The most disputed point about the origin of the Brahmi script has long been whether it was a purely indigenous development or was borrowed or derived from scripts that originated outside India. Goyal (1979) noted that most proponents of the indigenous view are fringe Indian scholars, whereas the theory of Semitic origin is held by &quot;nearly all&quot; Western scholars, and Salomon agrees with Goyal that there has been &quot;nationalist bias&quot; and &quot;imperialist bias&quot; on the two respective sides of the debate. In spite of this, the view of indigenous development had been prevalent among British scholars writing prior to Bühler: a passage by Alexander Cunningham, one of the earliest indigenous origin proponents, suggests that, in his time, the indigenous origin was a preference of British scholars in opposition to the &quot;unknown Western&quot; origin preferred by continental scholars. Cunningham in the seminal &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum&quot; of 1877 speculated that Brahmi characters were derived from, among other things, a pictographic principle based on the human body, but Bühler noted that, by 1891, Cunningham considered the origins of the script uncertain.
Most scholars believe that Brahmi was likely derived from or influenced by a Semitic script model, with Aramaic being a leading candidate. However, the issue is not settled due to the lack of direct evidence and unexplained differences between Aramaic, Kharoṣṭhī, and Brahmi. Though Brahmi and the Kharoṣṭhī script share some general features, the differences between the Kharosthi and Brahmi scripts are &quot;much greater than their similarities&quot;, and &quot;the overall differences between the two render a direct linear development connection unlikely&quot;, states Richard Salomon.

Virtually all authors accept that regardless of the origins, the differences between the Indian script and those proposed to have influenced it are significant. The degree of Indian development of the Brahmi script in both the graphic form and the structure has been extensive. It is also widely accepted that theories about the grammar of the Vedic language probably had a strong influence on this development. Some authors – both Western and Indian – suggest that Brahmi was borrowed or inspired by a Semitic script, invented in a short few years during the reign of Ashoka, and then used widely for Ashokan inscriptions. In contrast, some authors reject the idea of foreign influence.

Bruce Trigger states that Brahmi likely emerged from the Aramaic script (with extensive local development), but there is no evidence of a direct common source. According to Trigger, Brahmi was in use before the Ashoka pillars, at least by the 4th or 5th century BCE in Sri Lanka and India, while Kharoṣṭhī was used only in northwest South Asia (eastern parts of modern Afghanistan and neighboring regions of Pakistan) for a while before it died out in the third century. According to Salomon, evidence of the use of Kharoṣṭhī is found primarily in Buddhist records and those of Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian, Indo-Parthian, and Kushana dynasty era.

Justeson and Stephens proposed that this inherent vowel system in Brahmi and Kharoṣṭhī developed by transmission of a Semitic abjad through the recitation of its letter values. The idea is that learners of the source alphabet recite the sounds by combining the consonant with an unmarked vowel, e.g. , and in the process of borrowing into another language, these syllables are taken to be the sound values of the symbols. They also accepted the idea that Brahmi was based on a North Semitic model.

===Semitic hypothesis===
Many scholars link the origin of Brahmi to Semitic script models, particularly Aramaic. The explanation of how this might have happened, the particular Semitic script, and the chronology of the derivation have been the subject of much debate. Bühler followed Max Weber in connecting it particularly to Phoenician, and proposed an early 8th century BCE date for the borrowing. A link to the South Semitic scripts, a less prominent branch of the Semitic script family, has occasionally been proposed, but has not gained much acceptance. Finally, the Aramaic script being the prototype for Brahmi has been the more preferred hypothesis because of its geographic proximity to the Indian subcontinent, and its influence likely arising because Aramaic was the bureaucratic language of the Achaemenid empire. However, this hypothesis does not explain the mystery of why two very different scripts, Kharoṣṭhī and Brahmi, developed from the same Aramaic. A possible explanation might be that Ashoka created an imperial script for his edicts, but there is no evidence to support this conjecture.

The chart below shows the close resemblance that Brahmi has with the first four letters of Semitic script, the first column representing the Phoenician alphabet.

====Bühler&#x27;s hypothesis====
According to the Semitic hypothesis as laid out by Bühler in 1898, the oldest Brahmi inscriptions were derived from a Phoenician prototype. Salomon states Bühler&#x27;s arguments are &quot;weak historical, geographical, and chronological justifications for a Phoenician prototype&quot;. Discoveries made since Bühler&#x27;s proposal, such as of six Mauryan inscriptions in Aramaic, suggest Bühler&#x27;s proposal about Phoenician as weak. It is more likely that Aramaic, which was virtually certainly the prototype for Kharoṣṭhī, also may have been the basis for Brahmi. However, it is unclear why the ancient Indians would have developed two very different scripts.
According to Bühler, Brahmi added symbols for certain sounds not found in Semitic languages, and either deleted or repurposed symbols for Aramaic sounds not found in Prakrit. For example, Aramaic lacks the phonetic retroflex feature that appears among Prakrit dental stops, such as , and in Brahmi the symbols of the retroflex and non-retroflex consonants are graphically very similar, as if both had been derived from a single prototype. (See Tibetan alphabet for a similar later development.) Aramaic did not have Brahmi&#x27;s aspirated consonants (, , etc.), whereas Brahmi did not have Aramaic&#x27;s emphatic consonants (&quot;&quot;), and it appears that these unneeded emphatic letters filled in for some of Brahmi&#x27;s aspirates: Aramaic &quot;q&quot; for Brahmi &quot;kh,&quot; Aramaic &quot;ṭ&quot; (Θ) for Brahmi &quot;th&quot; (), etc. And just where Aramaic did not have a corresponding emphatic stop, &quot;p&quot;, Brahmi seems to have doubled up for the corresponding aspirate: Brahmi &quot;p&quot; and &quot;ph&quot; are graphically very similar, as if taken from the same source in Aramaic &quot;p&quot;. Bühler saw a systematic derivational principle for the other aspirates &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;jh&quot;, &quot;ph&quot;, &quot;bh&quot;, and &quot;dh&quot;, which involved adding a curve or upward hook to the right side of the character (which has been speculated to derive from &quot;h&quot;, ), while &quot;d&quot; and &quot;ṭ&quot; (not to be confused with the Semitic emphatic ) were derived by back formation from &quot;dh&quot; and &quot;ṭh&quot;.

The attached table lists the correspondences between Brahmi and North Semitic scripts.

Bühler states that both Phoenician and Brahmi had three voiceless sibilants, but because the alphabetical ordering was lost, the correspondences among them are not clear. Bühler was able to suggest Brahmi derivatives corresponding to all of the 22 North Semitic characters, though clearly, as Bühler himself recognized, some are more confident than others. He tended to place much weight on phonetic congruence as a guideline, for example connecting &quot;c&quot; to tsade 𐤑 rather than kaph 𐤊, as preferred by many of his predecessors.

One of the key problems with a Phoenician derivation is the lack of evidence for historical contact with Phoenicians in the relevant period. Bühler explained this by proposing that the initial borrowing of Brahmi characters dates back considerably earlier than the earliest known evidence, as far back as 800 BCE, contemporary with the Phoenician glyph forms that he mainly compared. Bühler cited a near-modern practice of writing Brahmic scripts informally without vowel diacritics as a possible continuation of this earlier abjad-like stage in development.

The weakest forms of the Semitic hypothesis are similar to Gnanadesikan&#x27;s trans-cultural diffusion view of the development of Brahmi and Kharoṣṭhī, in which the idea of alphabetic sound representation was learned from the Aramaic-speaking Persians, but much of the writing system was a novel development tailored to the phonology of Prakrit.

Further evidence cited in favor of Persian influence has been the Hultzsch proposal in 1925 that the Prakrit/Sanskrit word for writing itself, &quot;lipi&quot; is similar to the Old Persian word &quot;dipi&quot;, suggesting a probable borrowing. A few of the Ashoka edicts from the region nearest the Persian empire use &quot;dipi&quot; as the Prakrit word for writing, which appears as &quot;lipi&quot; elsewhere, and this geographic distribution has long been taken, at least back to Bühler&#x27;s time, as an indication that the standard &quot;lipi&quot; form is a later alteration that appeared as it diffused away from the Persian sphere of influence. Persian &quot;dipi&quot; itself is thought to be an Elamite loanword.
====Greek-Semitic model hypothesis====

Falk&#x27;s 1993 book is a study on writing in ancient India, and has a section on the origins of Brahmi. It features an extensive review of the literature up to that time. Falk sees the basic writing system of Brahmi as being derived from the Kharoṣṭhī script, itself a derivative of Aramaic. At the time of his writing, the Ashoka edicts were the oldest confidently dateable examples of Brahmi, and he perceives in them &quot;a clear development in language from a faulty linguistic style to a well honed one&quot; over time, which he takes to indicate that the script had been recently developed. Falk deviates from the mainstream of opinion in seeing Greek as also being a significant source for Brahmi. On this point particularly, Salomon disagrees with Falk, and after presenting evidence of very different methodology between Greek and Brahmi notation of vowel quantity, he states &quot;it is doubtful whether Brahmi derived even the basic concept from a Greek prototype&quot;. Further, adds Salomon, in a &quot;limited sense Brahmi can be said to be derived from Kharosthi, but in terms of the actual forms of the characters, the differences between the two Indian scripts are much greater than the similarities&quot;.

Falk also dated the origin of Kharoṣṭhī to no earlier than 325 BCE, based on a proposed connection to the Greek conquest. Salomon questions Falk&#x27;s arguments as to the date of Kharoṣṭhī and writes that it is &quot;speculative at best and hardly constitutes firm grounds for a late date for Kharoṣṭhī. The stronger argument for this position is that we have no specimen of the script before the time of Ashoka, nor any direct evidence of intermediate stages in its development; but of course this does not mean that such earlier forms did not exist, only that, if they did exist, they have not survived, presumably because they were not employed for monumental purposes before Ashoka&quot;.

Unlike Bühler, Falk does not provide details of which and how the presumptive prototypes may have been mapped to the individual characters of Brahmi. Further, states Salomon, Falk accepts there are anomalies in phonetic value and diacritics in Brahmi script that are not found in the presumed Kharoṣṭhī script source. Falk attempts to explain these anomalies by reviving the Greek influence hypothesis, a hypothesis that had previously fallen out of favor.

Hartmut Scharfe, in his 2002 review of Kharoṣṭī and Brāhmī scripts, concurs with Salomon&#x27;s questioning of Falk&#x27;s proposal, and states, &quot;the pattern of the phonemic analysis of the Sanskrit language achieved by the Vedic scholars is much closer to the Brahmi script than the Greek alphabet&quot;.

As of 2018, Harry Falk refined his view by affirming that Brahmi was developed from scratch in a rational way at the time of Ashoka, by consciously combining the advantages of the pre-existing Greek script and northern Kharosthi script. Greek-style letter types were selected for their &quot;broad, upright and symmetrical form&quot;, and writing from left to right was also adopted for its convenience. On the other hand, the Kharosthi treatment of vowels was retained, with its inherent vowel &quot;a&quot;, derived from Aramaic, and stroke additions to represent other vowel signs. In addition, a new system of combining consonants vertically to represent complex sounds was also developed.

===Indigenous origin hypothesis===

The possibility of an indigenous origin such as a connection to the Indus script is supported by some Western and Indian scholars and writers. The theory that there are similarities to the Indus script was suggested by early European scholars such as the archaeologist John Marshall and the Assyriologist Stephen Langdon. G. R. Hunter in his book &quot;The Script of Harappa and Mohenjodaro and Its Connection with Other Scripts&quot; (1934) proposed a derivation of the Brahmi alphabets from the Indus script, the match being considerably higher than that of Aramaic in his estimation. British archaeologist Raymond Allchin stated that there is a powerful argument against the idea that the Brahmi script has Semitic borrowing because the whole structure and conception is quite different. He at one time suggested that the origin may have been purely indigenous with the Indus script as its predecessor. However, Allchin and Erdosy later in 1995 expressed the opinion that there was as yet insufficient evidence to resolve the question.
Today the indigenous origin hypothesis is more commonly promoted by non-specialists, such as the computer scientist Subhash Kak, the spiritual teachers David Frawley and Georg Feuerstein, and the social anthropologist Jack Goody. Subhash Kak disagrees with the proposed Semitic origins of the script, instead stating that the interaction between the Indic and the Semitic worlds before the rise of the Semitic scripts might imply a reverse process. However, the chronology thus presented and the notion of an unbroken tradition of literacy is opposed by a majority of academics who support an indigenous origin. Evidence for a continuity between Indus and Brahmi has also been seen in graphic similarities between Brahmi and the late Indus script, where the ten most common ligatures correspond with the form of one of the ten most common glyphs in Brahmi. There is also corresponding evidence of continuity in the use of numerals. Further support for this continuity comes from statistical analysis of the relationship carried out by Das.

Salomon considered simple graphic similarities between characters to be insufficient evidence for a connection without knowing the phonetic values of the Indus script, though he found apparent similarities in patterns of compounding and diacritical modification to be &quot;intriguing&quot;. However, he felt that it was premature to explain and evaluate them due to the large chronological gap between the scripts and the thus far indecipherable nature of the Indus script.

The main obstacle to this idea is the lack of evidence for writing during the millennium and a half between the collapse of the Indus Valley civilisation around 1500 BCE and the first widely accepted appearance of Brahmi in the 3rd or 4th centuries BCE. Iravathan Mahadevan makes the point that even if one takes the latest dates of 1500 BCE for the Indus script and earliest claimed dates of Brahmi around 500 BCE, a thousand years still separates the two. Furthermore, there is no accepted decipherment of the Indus script, which makes theories based on claimed decipherments tenuous.

A promising possible link between the Indus script and later writing traditions may be in the megalithic graffiti symbols of the South Indian megalithic culture, which may have some overlap with the Indus symbol inventory and persisted in use up at least through the appearance of the Brahmi and scripts up into the third century CE. These graffiti usually appear singly, though on occasion may be found in groups of two or three, and are thought to have been family, clan, or religious symbols. In 1935, C. L. Fábri proposed that symbols found on Mauryan punch-marked coins were remnants of the Indus script that had survived the collapse of the Indus civilization.

Another form of the indigenous origin theory is that Brahmi was invented &quot;ex nihilo&quot;, entirely independently from either Semitic models or the Indus script, though Salomon found these theories to be wholly speculative in nature.

====Foreign origination====
Pāṇini (6th to 4th century BCE) mentions &quot;lipi&quot;, the Indian word for writing scripts in his definitive work on Sanskrit grammar, the &quot;Ashtadhyayi&quot;. According to Scharfe, the words &quot;lipi&quot; and &quot;libi&quot; are borrowed from the Old Persian &quot;dipi&quot;, in turn derived from Sumerian &quot;dup&quot;. To describe his own Edicts, Ashoka used the word &quot;Lipī&quot;, now generally simply translated as &quot;writing&quot; or &quot;inscription&quot;. It is thought the word &quot;lipi&quot;, which is also orthographed &quot;dipi&quot; in the two Kharosthi-version of the rock edicts, comes from an Old Persian prototype &quot;dipî&quot; also meaning &quot;inscription&quot;, which is used for example by Darius I in his Behistun inscription, suggesting borrowing and diffusion.

Scharfe adds that the best evidence is that no script was used or ever known in India, aside from the Persian-dominated Northwest where Aramaic was used, before around 300 BCE because Indian tradition &quot;at every occasion stresses the orality of the cultural and literary heritage&quot;, yet Scharfe in the same book admits that &quot;a script has been discovered in the excavations of the Indus Valley Civilization that flourished in the Indus valley and adjacent areas in the third millennium B.C. The number of different signs suggest a syllabic script, but all attempts at decipherment have been unsuccessful so far. Attempts by some Indian scholars to connect this undeciphered script with the Indian scripts in vogue from the third century B.C. onward are total failures.&quot;

====Megasthenes&#x27; observations====
Megasthenes, a Greek ambassador to the Mauryan court in Northeastern India only a quarter century before Ashoka, noted &quot;... and this among a people who have no written laws, who are ignorant even of writing, and regulate everything by memory.&quot; This has been variously and contentiously interpreted by many authors. Ludo Rocher almost entirely dismisses Megasthenes as unreliable, questioning the wording used by Megasthenes&#x27; informant and Megasthenes&#x27; interpretation of them. Timmer considers it to reflect a misunderstanding that the Mauryans were illiterate &quot;based upon the fact that Megasthenes rightly observed that the laws were unwritten and that oral tradition played such an important part in India.&quot;

Some proponents of the indigenous origin theories question the reliability and interpretation of comments made by Megasthenes (as quoted by Strabo in the &quot;Geographica&quot; XV.i.53). For one, the observation may only apply in the context of the kingdom of &quot;Sandrakottos&quot; (Chandragupta). Elsewhere in Strabo (Strab. XV.i.39), Megasthenes is said to have noted that it was a regular custom in India for the &quot;philosopher&quot; caste (presumably Brahmins) to submit &quot;anything useful which they have committed to writing&quot; to kings, but this detail does not appear in parallel extracts of Megasthenes found in Arrian and Diodorus Siculus. The implication of writing per se is also not totally clear in the original Greek as the term &quot;&quot; (source of the English word &quot;syntax&quot;) can be read as a generic &quot;composition&quot; or &quot;arrangement&quot;, rather than a written composition in particular. Nearchus, a contemporary of Megasthenes, noted, a few decades prior, the use of cotton fabric for writing in Northern India. Indologists have variously speculated that this might have been Kharoṣṭhī or the Aramaic alphabet. Salomon regards the evidence from Greek sources to be inconclusive. Strabo himself notes this inconsistency regarding reports on the use of writing in India (XV.i.67).

===Debate on time depth===

Kenneth Norman (2005) suggests that Brahmi was devised over a longer period of time predating Ashoka&#x27;s rule:

However, these finds are controversial, see .

He also notes that the variations seen in the Asokan edicts would be unlikely to have emerged so quickly if Brahmi had a single origin in the chancelleries of the Mauryan Empire. He suggests a date of not later than the end of the 4th century for the development of Brahmi script in the form represented in the inscriptions, with earlier possible antecedents.

Jack Goody (1987) had similarly suggested that ancient India likely had a &quot;very old culture of writing&quot; along with its oral tradition of composing and transmitting knowledge, because the Vedic literature is too vast, consistent and complex to have been entirely created, memorized, accurately preserved and spread without a written system.

Opinions on this point, the possibility that there may not have been any writing scripts including Brahmi during the Vedic age, given the quantity and quality of the Vedic literature, are divided. While Falk (1993) disagrees with Goody, while Walter Ong and John Hartley (2012) concur, not so much based on the difficulty of orally preserving the Vedic hymns, but on the basis that it is highly unlikely that Panini&#x27;s grammar was composed. Johannes Bronkhorst (2002) takes the intermediate position that the oral transmission of the Vedic hymns may well have been achieved orally, but that the development of Panini&#x27;s grammar presupposes writing (consistent with a development of Indian writing in c. the 4th century BCE).

===Origin of the name===

Several divergent accounts of the origin of the name &quot;Brahmi&quot; (ब्राह्मी) appear in history. The term &quot;Brahmi&quot; (बाम्भी in original) appears in Indian texts in different contexts. According to the rules of the Sanskrit language, it is a feminine word meaning literally &quot;of Brahma&quot; or &quot;the female energy of the Brahman&quot;. In popular Hindu texts such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, it appears in the sense of a goddess, particularly for Saraswati as the goddess of speech and elsewhere as &quot;personified Shakti (energy) of Brahma, the god of Hindu scriptures Veda and creation&quot;. Later Chinese Buddhist account of the 6th century CE also supports its creation to the god Brahma, though Monier Monier-Williams, Sylvain Lévi and others thought it was more likely to have been given the name because it was moulded by the Brahmins.

Alternatively, some Buddhist sutras such as the &quot;Lalitavistara Sūtra&quot; (possibly 4th century CE), list &quot;Brāhmī&quot; and &quot;Kharoṣṭī&quot; as some of the sixty-four scripts the Buddha knew as a child. Several sutras of Jainism such as the &quot;Vyakhya Pragyapti Sutra&quot;, the &quot;Samvayanga Sutra&quot; and the &quot;Pragyapna Sutra&quot; of the Jain Agamas include a list of 18 writing scripts known to teachers before the Mahavira was born, the first one being &quot;Bambhi&quot; (बाम्भी) in the original Prakrit, which has been interpreted as &quot;Bramhi&quot;. The Brahmi script is missing from the list of 18 scripts in the surviving versions of two later Jaina Sutras, namely the &quot;Vishesha Avashyaka&quot; and the &quot;Kalpa Sutra&quot;. Jain legend recounts that 18 writing scripts were taught by their first Tirthankara Rishabhanatha to his daughter Bambhi (बाम्भी); she emphasized बाम्भी as the main script as she taught others, and therefore the name Brahmi for the script comes after her name. There is no early epigraphic proof for the expression &quot;Brahmi script&quot;. Ashoka himself when he created the first known inscriptions in the new script in the 3rd century BCE, used the expression &quot;dhaṃma lipi&quot; (Prakrit in the Brahmi script: , &quot;Inscriptions of the Dharma&quot;) but this is not to describe the script of his own Edicts.

==History==

The earliest known full inscriptions of Brahmi are in Prakrit, dated to be from the 3rd to 1st centuries BCE, particularly the Edicts of Ashoka, c. 250 BCE. Prakrit records predominate the epigraphic records discovered in the Indian subcontinent through about the 1st century CE. The earliest known Brahmi inscriptions in Sanskrit are from the 1st century BCE, such as the few discovered in Ayodhya, Ghosundi and Hathibada (both near Chittorgarh). Ancient inscriptions have also been discovered in many North and Central Indian sites, occasionally in South India as well, that are in hybrid Sanskrit-Prakrit language called &quot;Epigraphical Hybrid Sanskrit&quot;. These are dated by modern techniques to between the 1st and 4th centuries CE. Surviving ancient records of the Brahmi script are found as engravings on pillars, temple walls, metal plates, terracotta, coins, crystals and manuscripts.

One of the most important recent developments regarding the origin of Brahmi has been the discovery of Brahmi characters inscribed on fragments of pottery from the trading town of Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka, which have been dated to between the 6th and the early 4th century BCE, although these finds are controversial (see ). In 1996, Coningham et al. stated that the script on the Anuradhapura inscriptions is Brahmi, but stated that the language was a Prakrit rather than a Dravidian language. The historical sequence of the specimens was interpreted to indicate an evolution in the level of stylistic refinement over several centuries, and they concluded that the Brahmi script may have arisen out of &quot;mercantile involvement&quot; and that the growth of trade networks in Sri Lanka was correlated with its first appearance in the area. Salomon in his 1998 review states that the Anuradhapura inscriptions support the theory that Brahmi existed in South Asia before the Mauryan times, with studies favoring the 4th century BCE, but some doubts remain whether the inscriptions might be intrusive into the potsherds from a later date. Indologist Harry Falk has argued that the Edicts of Ashoka represent an older stage of Brahmi, whereas certain paleographic features of even the earliest Anuradhapura inscriptions are likely to be later, and so these potsherds may date from after 250 BCE.

More recently in 2013, Rajan and Yatheeskumar published excavations at Porunthal and Kodumanal in Tamil Nadu, where numerous both Tamil-Brahmi and &quot;Prakrit-Brahmi&quot; inscriptions and fragments have been found. Their stratigraphic analysis combined with radiocarbon dates of paddy grains and charcoal samples indicated that inscription contexts date to as far back as the 6th and perhaps 7th centuries BCE. As these were published very recently, they have as yet not been commented on extensively in the literature. Indologist Harry Falk has criticized Rajan&#x27;s claims as &quot;particularly ill-informed&quot;; Falk argues that some of the earliest supposed inscriptions are not Brahmi letters at all, but merely misinterpreted non-linguistic Megalithic graffiti symbols, which were used in South India for several centuries during the pre-literate era.

=== Calligraphical evolution (3rd century BCE – 1st century CE) ===

The calligraphy of the Brahmi script remained virtually unchanged from the time of the Maurya Empire to the end of the 1st century BCE. Around this time, the Indo-Scythians (&quot;Northern Satraps&quot;), after their establishment in northern India introduced &quot;revolutionary changes&quot; in the way Brahmi was written. In the 1st century BCE, the shape of Brahmi characters became more angular, and the vertical segments of letters were equalized, a phenomenon that is clearly visible in coin legends and that made the script visually more similar to the Greek script. In this new typeface, the letter were &quot;neat and well-formed&quot;. The probable introduction of ink and pen writing, with the characteristic thickenned start of each stroke generated by the usage of ink, was reproduced in the calligraphy of stone inscriptions by the creation of a triangle-shaped form at the beginning of each stroke. This new writing style is particularly visible in the numerous dedicatory inscriptions made in Mathura, in association with devotional works of art. This new calligraphy of the Brahmi script was adopted in the rest of the subcontinent of the next half century. The &quot;new-pen-style&quot; initiated a rapid evolution of the script from the 1st century CE, with regional variations starting to emerge.

===Decipherment===

Besides a few inscriptions in Greek and Aramaic (which were only discovered in the 20th century), the Edicts of Ashoka were written in the Brahmi script and sometimes in the Kharoshthi script in the northwest, which had both become extinct around the 4th century CE, and were yet undeciphered at the time the Edicts were discovered and investigated in the 19th century.

Inscriptions of the 6th century CE in late Brahmi were already deciphered in 1785 by Charles Wilkins, who published an essentially correct translation of the Gopika Cave Inscription written by the Maukhari king Anantavarman. Wilkins seems to have relied essentially on the similarities with later Brahmic scripts, such as the script of the Pala period and early forms of Devanagari.

Early Brahmi, however, remained unreadable. Progress resumed in 1834 with the publication of proper facsimiles of the inscriptions on the Allahabad pillar of Ashoka, notably containing Edicts of Ashoka as well as inscriptions by the Gupta Empire ruler Samudragupta.

James Prinsep, an archaeologist, philologist, and official of the East India Company, started to analyse the inscriptions and made deductions on the general characteristics of the early Brahmi script essentially relying on statistical methods. This method, published in March 1834, allowed him to classify the characters found in inscriptions, and to clarify the structure of Brahmi as being composed of consonantal characters with vocalic &quot;inflections&quot;. He was able to correctly guess four out of five vocalic inflections, but the value of consonants remained unknown. Although this statistical method was modern and innovative, the actual decipherment of the script would have to wait until after the discovery of bilingual inscriptions, a few years later.

The same year, in 1834, some attempts by Rev. J. Stevenson were made to identify intermediate early Brahmi characters from the Karla Caves () based on their similarities with the Gupta script of the Samudragupta inscription of the Allahabad pillar (4th century CE), which had just been published, but this led to a mix of good (about 1/3) and bad guesses and did not permit proper decipherment of the Brahmi.

The next major step towards deciphering the ancient Brahmi script of the 3rd–2nd centuries BCE was made in 1836 by Norwegian scholar Christian Lassen, who used a bilingual Greek-Brahmi coin of Indo-Greek king Agathocles and similarities with the Pali script to correctly and securely identify several Brahmi letters. The matching legends on the bilingual coins of Agathocles were:

James Prinsep was then able to complete the decipherment of the Brahmi script. After acknowledging Lassen&#x27;s first decipherment, Prinsep used a bilingual coin of Indo-Greek king Pantaleon to decipher a few more letters. James Prinsep then analysed a large number of donatory inscriptions on the reliefs in Sanchi, and noted that most of them ended with the same two Brahmi characters: &quot;𑀤𑀦𑀁&quot;. Prinsep guessed correctly that they stood for &quot;danam&quot;, the Sanskrit word for &quot;gift&quot; or &quot;donation&quot;, which permitted to further increase the number of known letters. With the help of Ratna Pâla, a Singhalese Pali scholar and linguist, Prinsep then completed the full decipherment of the Brahmi script. In a series of results that he published in March 1838 Prinsep was able to translate the inscriptions on a large number of rock edicts found around India, and provide, according to Richard Salomon, a &quot;virtually perfect&quot; rendering of the full Brahmi alphabet.

===Southern Brahmi===
Ashokan inscriptions are found all over India and a few regional variants have been observed. The Bhattiprolu alphabet, with earliest inscriptions dating from a few decades of Ashoka&#x27;s reign, is believed to have evolved from a southern variant of the Brahmi alphabet. The language used in these inscriptions, nearly all of which have been found upon Buddhist relics, is exclusively Prakrit, though Kannada and Telugu proper names have been identified in some inscriptions. Twenty-three letters have been identified. The letters &quot;ga&quot; and &quot;sa&quot; are similar to Mauryan Brahmi, while &quot;bha&quot; and &quot;da&quot; resemble those of modern Kannada and Telugu script.

Tamil-Brahmi is a variant of the Brahmi alphabet that was in use in South India by about the 3rd century BCE, particularly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Inscriptions attest their use in parts of Sri Lanka in the same period. The language used in around 70 Southern Brahmi inscriptions discovered in the 20th century have been identified as a Prakrit language.

In English, the most widely available set of reproductions of Brahmi texts found in Sri Lanka is &quot;Epigraphia Zeylanica&quot;; in volume 1 (1976), many of the inscriptions are dated to the 3rd–2nd century BCE.

Unlike the edicts of Ashoka, however, the majority of the inscriptions from this early period in Sri Lanka are found above caves. The language of Sri Lanka Brahmi inscriptions has been mostly been Prakrit though some Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have also been found, such as the Annaicoddai seal. The earliest widely accepted examples of writing in Brahmi are found in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka.

===Red Sea and Southeast Asia===
The Khuan Luk Pat inscription discovered in Thailand is in Tamil Brahmi script. Its date is uncertain; the first century CE has been proposed. According to Frederick Asher, Tamil Brahmi inscriptions on potsherds have been found in Quseir al-Qadim and in Berenike, Egypt, which suggest that merchant and trade activity was flourishing in ancient times between India and the Red Sea region. Additional Tamil Brahmi inscription has been found in Khor Rori region of Oman on an archaeological site storage jar.

==Characteristics==
Brahmi is usually written from left to right, as in the case of its descendants. However, an early coin found in Eran is inscribed with Brahmi running from right to left, as in Aramaic. Several other instances of variation in the writing direction are known, though directional instability is fairly common in ancient writing systems.
===Consonants===
Brahmi is an abugida, meaning that each letter represents a consonant, while vowels are written with obligatory diacritics called &quot;mātrā&quot;s in Sanskrit, except when the vowels begin a word. When no vowel is written, the vowel is understood. This &quot;default short a&quot; is a characteristic shared with Kharosthī, though the treatment of vowels differs in other respects. 
===Conjunct consonants===
Special conjunct consonants are used to write consonant clusters such as or . In modern Devanagari the components of a conjunct are written left to right when possible (when the first consonant has a vertical stem that can be removed at the right), whereas in Brahmi characters are joined vertically downwards.
===Vowels===
Vowels following a consonant are inherent or written by diacritics, but initial vowels have dedicated letters. There are three &quot;primary&quot; vowels in Ashokan Brahmi, which each occur in length-contrasted forms: /a/, /i/, /u/; long vowels are derived from the letters for short vowels. There are also four &quot;secondary&quot; vowels that do not have the long-short contrast, /e:/, /ai/, /o:/, /au/. Note though that the grapheme for /ai/ is derivative from /e/ in a way that parallels the short-long contrast of the primary vowels (historically they were /ai/ and /a:i/). However, there are only nine distinct vowel diacritics, as short is understood if no vowel is written. The initial vowel symbol for /au/ is also apparently lacking in the earliest attested phases, even though it has a diacritic. Ancient sources suggest that there were either 11 or 12 vowels enumerated at the beginning of the character list around the Ashokan era, probably adding either &quot;aṃ&quot; or &quot;aḥ&quot;. Later versions of Brahmi add vowels for four syllabic liquids, short and long /ṛ/ and /ḷ/. Chinese sources indicate that these were later inventions by either Nagarjuna or Śarvavarman, a minister of King Hāla.

It has been noted that the basic system of vowel marking common to Brahmi and Kharosthī, in which every consonant is understood to be followed by a vowel, was well suited to Prakrit, but as Brahmi was adapted to other languages, a special notation called the &quot;virāma&quot; was introduced to indicate the omission of the final vowel. Kharoṣṭhī also differs in that the initial vowel representation has a single generic vowel symbol that is differentiated by diacritics, and long vowels are not distinguished.

The collation order of Brahmi is believed to have been the same as most of its descendant scripts, one based on Shiksha, the traditional Vedic theory of Sanskrit phonology. This begins the list of characters with the initial vowels (starting with &quot;a&quot;), then lists a subset of the consonants in five phonetically related groups of five called &quot;vargas&quot;, and ends with four liquids, three sibilants, and a spirant. Thomas Trautmann attributes much of the popularity of the Brahmic script family to this &quot;splendidly reasoned&quot; system of arrangement.
===Punctuation===
 Punctuation can be perceived as more of an exception than as a general rule in Asokan Brahmi. For instance, distinct spaces in between the words appear frequently in the pillar edicts but not so much in others. (&quot;Pillar edicts&quot; refers to the texts that are inscribed on the stone pillars oftentimes with the intention of making them public.) The idea of writing each word separately was not consistently used.

In the early Brahmi period, the existence of punctuation marks is not very well shown. Each letter has been written independently with some occasional space between words and longer sections.

In the middle period, the system seems to be developing. The use of a dash and a curved horizontal line is found. A lotus (flower) mark seems to mark the end, and a circular mark appears to indicate the full stop. There seem to be varieties of full stop.

In the late period, the system of interpunctuation marks gets more complicated. For instance, there are four different forms of vertically slanted double dashes that resemble &quot; //&quot; to mark the completion of the composition. Despite all the decorative signs that were available during the late period, the signs remained fairly simple in the inscriptions. One of the possible reasons may be that engraving is restricted while writing is not.

Baums identifies seven different punctuation marks needed for computer representation of Brahmi:
* single (𑁇) and double (𑁈) vertical bar (danda) – delimiting clauses and verses
* dot (𑁉), double dot (𑁊), and horizontal line (𑁋) – delimiting shorter textual units
* crescent (𑁌) and lotus (𑁍) – delimiting larger textual units

==Evolution of the Brahmi script==
Brahmi is generally classified in three main types, which represent three main historical stages of its evolution over nearly a millennium:
* Early Brahmi represented in the Ashokan script. (3rd–1st century BCE)
* Middle Brahmi also known as &quot;Kushana Brahmi&quot; (1st–3rd centuries CE)
* Late Brahmi represented in the Gupta script (4th–6th centuries CE)

==Early Brahmi or &quot;Ashokan Brahmi&quot; (3rd–1st century BCE)==
Early &quot;Ashokan&quot; Brahmi (3rd–1st century BCE) is regular and geometric, and organized in a very rational fashion:

===Independent vowels===

===Consonants===

The final letter does not fit into the table above; it is .

===Some famous inscriptions in the Early Brahmi script===

The Brahmi script was the medium for some of the most famous inscriptions of ancient India, starting with the Edicts of Ashoka, .

====Birthplace of the historical Buddha====

In a particularly famous Edict, the Rummindei Edict in Lumbini, Nepal, Ashoka describes his visit in the 21st year of his reign, and designates Lumbini as the birthplace of the Buddha. He also, for the first time in historical records, uses the epithet &quot;Sakyamuni&quot; (Sage of the Shakyas), to describe the Buddha.

====Heliodorus Pillar inscription====
The Heliodorus pillar is a stone column that was erected around 113 BCE in central India in Vidisha near modern Besnagar, by Heliodorus, an ambassador of the Indo-Greek king Antialcidas in Taxila to the court of the Shunga king Bhagabhadra. Historically, it is one of the earliest known inscriptions related to the Vaishnavism in India.

==Middle Brahmi or &quot;Kushana Brahmi&quot; (1st–3rd centuries CE)==
Middle Brahmi or &quot;Kushana Brahmi&quot; was in use from the 1st–3rd centuries CE. It is more rounded than its predecessor, and introduces some significant variations in shapes. Several characters (r̩ and l̩), classified as vowels, were added during the &quot;Middle Brahmi&quot; period between the 1st and 3rd centuries CE, in order to accommodate the transcription of Sanskrit:

===Independent vowels===

===Consonants===
===Examples===
==Late Brahmi or &quot;Gupta Brahmi&quot; (4th–6th centuries CE)==

===Independent vowels===

===Consonants===
===Examples===
==Descendants==
Over the course of a millennium, Brahmi developed into numerous regional scripts. Over time, these regional scripts became associated with the local languages. A Northern Brahmi gave rise to the Gupta script during the Gupta Empire, sometimes also called &quot;Late Brahmi&quot; (used during the 5th century), which in turn diversified into a number of cursives during the Middle Ages, including the Siddhaṃ script (6th century) and Śāradā script (9th century).

Southern Brahmi gave rise to the Grantha alphabet (6th century), the Vatteluttu alphabet (8th century), and due to the contact of Hinduism with Southeast Asia during the early centuries CE, also gave rise to the Baybayin in the Philippines, the Javanese script in Indonesia, the Khmer alphabet in Cambodia, and the Old Mon script in Burma.

Also in the Brahmic family of scripts are several Central Asian scripts such as Tibetan, Tocharian (also called slanting Brahmi), and the one used to write the Saka language.

The Brahmi script also evolved into the Nagari script, which in turn evolved into Devanagari and Nandinagari. Both were used to write Sanskrit, until the latter was merged into the former. The resulting script is widely adopted across India to write Sanskrit, Marathi, Hindi and its dialects, and Konkani.

The arrangement of Brahmi was adopted as the modern order of Japanese kana, though the letters themselves are unrelated.

===Possible tangential relationships===

Some authors have theorized that some of the basic letters of hangul may have been influenced by the &#x27;Phags-pa script of the Mongol Empire, itself a derivative of the Tibetan alphabet, a Brahmi script (see Origin of Hangul). However, one of the authors, Gari Ledyard, on whose work much of this theorized connection rests, cautions against giving &#x27;Phags-pa much credit in the development of Hangul:

===Unicode===

Early Ashokan Brahmi was added to the Unicode Standard in October, 2010 with the release of version 6.0.

The Unicode block for Brahmi is U+11000–U+1107F. It lies within the Supplementary Multilingual Plane. As of June 2022 there are two non-commercially available fonts that support Brahmi, namely Noto Sans Brahmi commissioned by Google, which covers almost all the characters, and Adinatha, which only covers Tamil Brahmi. Segoe UI Historic, tied in with Windows 10, also features Brahmi glyphs.

The Sanskrit word for Brahmi, ब्राह्मी (IAST &quot;Brāhmī&quot;) in the Brahmi script should be rendered as follows: .

<doc id="284561" wikidata="Q312548" url="?curid=284561" title="Megasthenes">
<text>Megasthenes ( ; , died 290 BCE) was an ancient Greek historian, indologist, diplomat, ethnographer and explorer in the Hellenistic period. He described India in his book &quot;Indica&quot;, which is now lost, but has been partially reconstructed from literary fragments found in later authors that quoted his work. Megasthenes was the first person from the Western world to leave a written description of India.

== Biography ==

While Megasthenes&#x27;s account of India has survived in the later works, little is known about him as a person. He spent time at the court of Sibyrtius, who was a satrap of Arachosia under Antigonus I and then Seleucus I. Megasthenes was then an ambassador for Seleucid king Seleucus I Nicator and to the court of the Mauryan Emperor Chandragupta Maurya in Pataliputra (modern Patna). Dating for his journey to the Mauryan court is uncertain; Seleucus I reigned from 305 to 281 BCE for the loose range of years that Megasthenes&#x27; mission might have begun.

=== As ambassador ===

Megasthenes was a Greek ambassador of Seleucus I Nicator in the court of Chandragupta Maurya. Arrian explains that Megasthenes lived in Arachosia, with the satrap Sibyrtius, from where he visited India:

Megasthenes visited Pataliputra sometime during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya but it is not certain which other parts of India he visited. He appears to have passed through the Punjab region in north-western India, as he provides a detailed account of the rivers in this area. He must have then traveled to Pataliputra along the Yamuna and the Ganga rivers. The exact dates of his visit to India, and the duration of his stay in India are not certain. The dates of Megasthenes&#x27; visit or visits to India is uncertain and disputed among scholars. A.B. Bosworth argued for an early date pre-Seleucus. This is contested by Stoneman and others who argue for a date following the Mauryan-Seleucid settlement of 303 BCE. Arrian claims that Megasthenes met Porus; this implies that Megasthenes accompanied Alexander the Great during the Macedonian invasion of India.

He then compiled information about India in the form of &quot;Indica&quot;, a document which is now a lost work. It partially survives in form of quotations by later writers.

Other Greek envoys to the Indian court are known after Megasthenes: Deimachus as ambassador to Bindusara, and Dionysius, as ambassador to Ashoka.

== Assessment ==

Among the ancient writers, Arrian (2nd century CE) is the only one who speaks favorably of Megasthenes. Diodorus (1st century BCE) quotes Megasthenes while omitting some parts of his narratives. Other writers explicitly criticize Megasthenes:

* Eratosthenes (2nd century BCE) accuses Megasthenes of engaging in falsehood, although he apparently borrowed much of his content about India from Megasthenes.
* Strabo (1st century CE) calls Megasthenes a liar for writing fabulous stories about India; he also brands as liars the other earlier writers on India, including Deimachus, Onesicritus, Nearchus. According to Strabo, &quot;no faith whatever can be placed in Deimachos and Megasthenes&quot;.
* Pliny the Elder (1st century CE) criticizes Megasthenes&#x27;s description of the fabulous races of India, and his account of Herakles and Dionysus.

Modern scholars such as E. A. Schwanbeck, B. C. J. Timmer, and Truesdell Sparhawk Brown, have characterized Megasthenes as a generally reliable source of Indian history. Schwanbeck finds faults only with Megasthenes&#x27;s description of the gods worshipped in India. Brown is more critical of Megasthenes, but notes that Megasthenes visited only a small part of India, and must have relied on others for his observations: some of these observations seem to be erroneous, but others cannot be ignored by modern researchers. Thus, although he was often misled by the erroneous information provided by others, his work remained the principal source of information about India to subsequent writers.

<doc id="284567" wikidata="Q450666" url="?curid=284567" title="Peter Bartholomew">
<text>Peter Bartholomew (, , 1075 – 20 April 1099) was a French soldier and mystic who was part of the First Crusade as part of the army of Raymond of Saint-Gilles. Peter was initially a servant to William, Lord of Cunhlat.

== Mysticism ==
In December 1097, during the siege of Antioch, Peter reportedly began to have visions, mostly of Saint Andrew. Peter claimed Saint Andrew took him to the Church of St. Peter, inside Antioch, and showed him where the relic of the Holy Lance could be found. Saint Andrew instructed Peter to tell the Crusade leaders about this and to give the Lance to Raymond of St. Gilles when it was found. Peter did not immediately inform Raymond or the other leaders and was visited four more times before June 1098. He began to lose his sight in February 1098, probably because of the famine afflicting the Crusaders, although he believed Saint Andrew was punishing him.

After the Crusaders captured Antioch, Peter and Raymond began excavating the floor of the church. On 14 June 1098, Peter apparently discovered the Lance and claimed to have been visited once more by St. Andrew that night, who told him to establish a feast day in honor of the discovery. Many people, including the papal legate Adhemar of Le Puy, believed Peter was a charlatan and had simply brought a piece of iron with him to &quot;find.&quot; After Adhemar&#x27;s death later in 1098, Peter said Adhemar visited him to confirm the authenticity of the Lance.

The discovery of the Lance was at first considered to be a good omen, and it boosted the morale of the Crusaders when they were besieged by a Muslim army. The Lance was credited with ensuring the Crusader victory in this siege, just as Saint Andrew had promised. Nevertheless, Peter&#x27;s reputation was tarnished because many of the nobles still did not believe him. Without the theological force of Adhemar to unify the Crusaders, their forces were split into groups with differing opinions, some of which supported the legitimacy of the miracles experienced on the way to the Holy Land and some who did not. In this time, charlatanry and false miracles were common. He later claimed Christ had visited him and instructed the Crusaders to march barefoot to Jerusalem, although this was largely ignored. Other visions, from Christ, Saint Andrew, Adhemar and others, revealed divine anger at the various sins and vices of the Crusaders.

On 8 April 1099, Peter went through an ordeal by fire by his own choice in an attempt to prove himself. It is very likely that he was severely burned in the process, although he claimed he was uninjured because Christ had appeared to him in the fire and that he had been hurt afterwards when a crowd rushed to him and was rescued by Raymond Pilet d&#x27;Alès. He died on 20 April.

== In film ==
In the 2001 film &quot;The Crusaders&quot;, Peter Bartholomew was portrayed by Flavio Insinna.

<text>Holley Mims (February 10, 1929 – January 13, 1970) was a highly regarded middleweight boxer during the 1950s and 1960s. His overall record 64-27-6 (13 KOs) meant that he spent much of his career ranked among the top ten boxers in the middleweight category. Among his notable fights was a loss to Rubin Carter in 1962, a fight that he took on one day&#x27;s notice, having flown into New York City just prior the fight; Mims dropped Carter in round four. Because of the loss, Mims dropped out of &quot;The Ring&quot;″s list of the top-ten middleweights contenders. Holley fought Sugar Ray Robinson and lost. Some say Robinson only won by decision and that Mims was the real winner. Mims was known for fast hands and quick punches. They fought at what was Turner&#x27;s Area on 14th and W sts NW DC. Mims fought with a team that met around age 16 or 17 at the YMCA 12st between S and T Sts NW. Their team, Mims, Garland Edwards (whom Mims fought twice and won, once by split decision), Rocky Farrell, Arthur Bethea, Sam Jefferson. and many other notable boxers and athletes (Walter &#x27;Tommy&#x27; Thompson, weightlifter) over the years, trained at Finleys Gym owned by Jim Finley, well known and loved in DC.
Mims died of a kidney ailment at the age of 42. He was survived by a wife and two children.

<text>Sandra &quot;Puma&quot; Jones (October 5, 1953—January 28, 1990) was an American singer, best known as a member of the Grammy Award-winning reggae group Black Uhuru.

== Career ==
Born in Columbia, South Carolina, Jones graduated from Columbia University in New York City with a master&#x27;s degree and served as a social worker. She studied dance with the Chuck Davis troupe where she took a particular interest in African dance. After becoming disillusioned with city life she declared a need to &quot;discover her roots&quot; and moved to Jamaica.

Deciding to build a singing career, Jones briefly sang with Miriam Makeba (then using the name Mama Africa), and sang with the band Sons of Negus led by Ras Michael. In 1978, she was introduced by a mutual friend to Derrick &quot;Duckie&quot; Simpson, the leader of reggae group Black Uhuru. That group was undergoing a significant lineup change that also included the addition of singer Michael Rose. Jones became a full member of Black Uhuru and sang on seven studio albums, starting with &quot;Showcase&quot; in 1979 and also including the critically acclaimed &quot;Red&quot; in 1981 and the Grammy Award-winning &quot;Anthem&quot; in 1983. That album won the award for Best Reggae Album in 1985, the first year of that award&#x27;s existence.

Jones was noted for adding lyrics on religious and social topics to Black Uhuru songs, during a period when reggae musicians were often accused of being trite and dismissive of women, and she was also known for her haunting voice. Her last full album with the group was &quot;Brutal&quot; in 1986, which was nominated for another Grammy Award and reached the charts in New Zealand and the Netherlands. Before sessions began for the album &quot;Positive&quot; in 1987, Jones was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had to withdraw from Black Uhuru and was replaced by singer Olafunke. Jones returned to the United States for treatment and died at age 36 on January 28, 1990. She was buried near her family home in South Carolina.

<text>The Via Flaminia () was an ancient Roman road leading from Rome over the Apennine Mountains to &quot;Ariminum&quot; (Rimini) on the coast of the Adriatic Sea, and due to the ruggedness of the mountains was the major option the Romans had for travel between Etruria, Latium, Campania, and the Po Valley. The section running through northern Rome is where Constantine the Great, allegedly, had his famous vision of the Chi Rho, leading to his conversion to Christianity and the Christianization of the Roman Empire.

Today the same route, still called by the same name for much of its distance, is paralleled or overlaid by Strada Statale (SS) 3, also called Strada Regionale (SR) 3 in Lazio and Umbria, and Strada Provinciale (SP) 3 in Marche. It leaves Rome, goes up the Val Tevere (&quot;Valley of the Tiber&quot;) and into the mountains at Castello delle Formiche, ascends to Gualdo Tadino, continuing over the divide at Scheggia Pass, to Cagli. From there it descends the eastern slope waterways between the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines and the Umbrian Apennines to Fano on the coast and goes north, parallel to Highway A14 to Rimini.

This route, once convenient to Roman citizens and other travelers, is now congested by heavy traffic between north Italy and the capital at Rome. It remains a country road, while the traffic crosses by railway and autostrada through dozens of tunnels between Florence and Bologna, a shorter, more direct route under the ridges and nearly inaccessible passes.

==History==
It was constructed by Gaius Flaminius during his censorship, around 220 BC. Sources mention frequent improvements being made to it during the imperial period. Augustus instituted a general restoration of the roads of Italy, assigning supervision of different regions to various senators. He reserved the Flaminia for himself, and rebuilt all the bridges except the Pons Mulvius, by which it crosses the Tiber, north of Rome (built by Marcus Aemilius Scaurus in 109 BC), and an unknown Pons Minucius. Triumphal arches were erected in his honour on the former bridge and at &quot;Ariminum&quot;, the latter of which is still preserved. Vespasian constructed a new tunnel through the pass of &quot;Intercisa&quot; (Furlo), in AD 77, and Trajan, as inscriptions show, repaired several bridges along the road.

During the period of Roman expansion in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, the Flaminia became, with the sea route, a main axis of transportation by which wheat from the Po valley supplied Rome and central Italy. A number of major battles were fought on or near the Via Flaminia, for example at Sentinum (near the modern Sassoferrato) and near Tadinum (the modern Gualdo Tadino). Constantine the Great&#x27;s famous Battle of the Milvian Bridge also occurred on the road, after his nearby dream of the Chi Rho (which led to his conversion and that of the Roman Empire to Christianity).

In late antiquity the Via Flaminia remained Rome&#x27;s major artery both to the Adriatic and to Italy north of the Apennines. The Itinerarium Burdigalense and the Priscillianists who had been expelled from their sees both took this route to Rome despite its length.

After the fall of the western Roman Empire the route remained in use, and when the Ostrogothic king Theodahad set out from Ravenna for Rome around 535, a letter of Cassiodorus mentions work done to repair the road. After the emperor Justinian invaded Italy, competition between the Goths and Romans over strongpoints on the road resulted in more activity through a route that ran slightly to the north through Perugia, the old Etruscan Via Amerina. The Lombard conquest ultimately resulted in the breaking of the Via Flaminia. In the late sixth century the Via Flaminia was severed by the establishment of the Lombard Duchy of Spoleto, with the border around contested Narni. In its place was established the &#x27;Byzantine corridor&#x27;, a new route linking Rome and Ravenna that departed both cities on the Via Flaminia but which was forced due to political circumstances to pass through Perugia rather than Spoleto.

In the Middle Ages it was known as the &quot;Ravenna road&quot;, as it led to the then more important city of Ravenna. Following the end of the Exarchate of Ravenna, it fell into disuse during the Lombard period, but was partially reconstructed in the Renaissance era and continued to be of military importance down to the Napoleonic era and World War II. As the &quot;SS 3 (Strada Statale 3)&quot; it remains one of the principal highways from Rome to the Adriatic coast.
==Ancient route==
The Via Flaminia began at the Porta Fontinalis, a gate in the Servian Wall in ancient Rome, on the northern slope of the Capitoline Hill. It followed the Via Lata from the Campidoglio to the Porta Flaminia, a city gate of the Aurelian Walls, and the Piazzale Flaminio. This portion can be considered the urban stretch of the Via Flaminia. The road then crosses the Tiber at the Ponte Milvio. While the Via Cassia split off north, the Via Flaminia veared east before turning north again to follow the Tiber, and continued on to Saxa Rubra and Prima Porta. On a hill to the right of the Via Flaminia, a little beyond Prima Porta, are the ruins of &quot;Ad Gallinas&quot;, a villa that belonged to Livia, the wife of Augustus.

From there it made its way to &quot;Ocriculum&quot; (Otricoli) and &quot;Narnia&quot; (Narni), where it crossed the Nera River by the Ponte d&#x27;Augusto, the largest Roman bridge ever built, a splendid four-arched structure to which Martial alludes, one arch of which is still standing. It went on, followed at first by the modern road to &quot;Casuentum&quot; (San Gemini) which passes over two finely preserved ancient bridges, through &quot;Carsulae&quot; to the &quot;Vicus Martis Tudertium&quot; (near modern Massa Martana), then &quot;Mevania&quot; (Bevagna), and thence to &quot;Forum Flaminii&quot; (S. Giovanni Profiamma). Later, a more circuitous route from &quot;Narnia&quot; to &quot;Forum Flaminii&quot; was adopted, increasing the distance by 12 Roman miles (18 km) and passing by &quot;Interamna Nahars&quot; (Terni), &quot;Spoletium&quot; (Spoleto) and &quot;Fulginium&quot; (Foligno) from which a branch diverged to &quot;Perusia&quot; (Perugia).

From &quot;Forum Flaminii&quot;, where the two branches rejoined, the &quot;Flaminia&quot; went on to &quot;Nuceria Camellaria&quot; (Nocera Umbra) whence a branch road ran to &quot;Septempeda&quot; and thence either to Ancona or to &quot;Tolentinum&quot; (Tolentino) and &quot;Urbs Salvia&quot; (Urbisaglia) and &quot;Helvillum&quot; (site uncertain, probably Sigillo, but possibly Fossato di Vico), to cross the main ridge of the Apennines, a temple of Jupiter Apenninus standing at or near the summit of the pass according to one ancient author. From there it descended to &quot;Cales&quot; (Cagli), where it turned north-east following the gorges of the Burano. The narrowest pass was crossed by means of a tunnel chiseled out of solid rock: a first tunnel apparently of the 3rd century BC was replaced by an adjacent tunnel by Vespasian. This is the modern &quot;Gola del Furlo&quot;, the ancient name of which, &quot;Intercisa&quot;, means &quot;cut through&quot; with reference to these tunnels. The modern 2‑lane road, the &quot;SS 3 Flaminia&quot;, still uses Vespasian&#x27;s tunnel, the emperor&#x27;s dedicatory inscription still in place; remnants of the earlier tunnel can also be seen.

The &quot;Flaminia&quot; emerged from the gorges of the Apennines at &quot;Forum Sempronii&quot; (Fossombrone) and reached the coast of the Adriatic at &quot;Fanum Fortunae&quot; (Fano). Thence, it ran north-west through &quot;Pisaurum&quot; (Pesaro) to &quot;Ariminum&quot; (Rimini). The total distance from Rome was 210 Roman miles, by the older road and 222 Roman miles, by the newer. The road gave its name to a juridical district of Italy from the 2nd century onwards, the former territory of the Senones, which was at first associated with Umbria (with which indeed under Augustus it had formed the sixth region of Italy called &quot;Umbria et Ager Gallicus&quot;), but which after Constantine was always administered with &quot;Picenum&quot;.

=== Via Flaminia minor ===
The Via Flaminia minor (Via Flaminia Militare) was a more western route, constructed by Gaius Flaminius (son of the former Gaius Flaminius) in 187 BC from &quot;Bononia&quot; (Bologna) to &quot;Arretium&quot; (Arezzo). It gradually fell into disuse, and disappeared after the Middle Ages. Its exact route is unknown although in 1977 Franco Santi and Cesare Agostini claimed to have found remnants, as yet unconfirmed.

==Remains==

Extant remains of the road consist of rare patches of pavement (by far the largest is an intermittent stretch about 800 meters long at Rignano Flaminio in the northern Lazio), but for the most part of bridges, listed here in order from Rome:

*From Rome to Narni:
**the Milvian Bridge (&quot;Ponte Milvio&quot;)
**the Pile di Augusto
**Ponte Sanguinaro S of Narni
**the great bridge at Narni
*Along the western branch:
**Ponte Caldaro, damaged in World War II
**Ponte Calamone both before Sangemini
**Ponte Fonnaia near Acquasparta
**a bridge just outside Acquasparta, on which was built the church of S. Giovanni de Butris
**Ponte del Diavolo at Cavallara near Bastardo
*Along the eastern branch:
**Ponte Sanguinaro in Spoleto
**scant remains of a bridge at Pontebari

*After the branches rejoin at S. Giovanni Profiamma:
**bridge-like structure at Pieve Fanonica
**Le Spugne near Nocera Umbra
**three bridges in the comune of Fossato di Vico (one of which, however, belongs properly to a branch road off the main trunk of the Flaminia)
**Ponte Spiano in Costacciaro
**an imposing bridge at Villa Scirca, blown up in World War II
**five bridges in the comune of Cantiano, near Pontedazzo and Pontericcioli
**Ponte Mallio (or Manlio) at Cagli, which appears to be partly of pre-Roman (Umbrian) construction
**Tunnel at Furlo Pass

Other notable Roman vestiges along the road, aside from those within the individual towns, include a pair of tower tombs between Bevagna and Foligno; and along the eastern branch of the Flaminia in particular, in the area between Spoleto and Trevi, many small Romanesque churches, partly built of reused Roman stone (spolia) — including a few inscriptions — mark the straight line of the road quite clearly. A small stretch of the road remains in the ruins of Carsulae where it passes through the Arco di Traiano.

==Sport==
The road was used as part of the individual road race cycling event for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.

In Rome it runs past and gives its name to the Stadio Flaminio sports stadium.

<text>Cynthia Michele Kereluk ( ; born April 29, 1960) is a Canadian fitness model and beauty pageant titleholder. She won the title of Miss Canada 1984 and went on to compete in the Miss Universe 1984. From 1985 to 2000, she hosted the exercise program &quot;Everyday Workout&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
She is a native of Saskatoon and was adopted at birth. She was adopted by her mother, Elizabeth. Elizabeth went to the same church as Kereluk&#x27;s biological mother, who was an unmarried teen when she gave birth. The family moved from Saskatoon to Vancouver, and, later, to Summerland in the Okanagan.

Elizabeth remained unmarried until Kereluk was 12 years old, when she married Bud Kereluk, who worked as a carpenter. Cynthia is one of ten adopted siblings who had polio as a child and who she helped with recovery. Her adoptive mother looked after foster children and mentally and handicapped adults.

Prior to obtaining her degree in education from Simon Fraser University (SFU), Kereluk attended Okanagan College for 3 years. In October 1982, she moved to Edmonton, Alberta.

Her interests include weightlifting, judo and gymnastics. In her early years she won two judo championships, and further awards in poetry, story and drama championships.

== Career ==
Kereluk worked as a teacher in Kelowna after completing her degree at SFU. Prior to entering the pageants, Kereluk worked as an aerobics instructor in Edmonton.

Kereluk won the title of Miss Edmonton. In 1984, she won the Miss Canada title and competed in Miss Universe 1984. From 1985 to 2000 she reached both a Canadian (CFRN) and American (&quot;Lifetime&quot; cable network) audience through television with her exercise program, &quot;Everyday Workout&quot;. At the time, &quot;Everyday Workout&quot;&#x27;s sale to Lifetime was the second largest U.S. sale of an Edmonton-produced television program. Kereluk contributed the fitness program for Chantal Jakel and Denise Hamilton&#x27;s 1999 cookbook, &quot;Fit to Cook&quot;.

Kereluk has had small parts in three movies; &quot;Mark of Cain&quot; (1985, aka &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;), &quot;The Pink Chiquitas&quot; (1986), and &quot;Overnight (1985 film)&quot;.

== Personal life ==
On August 28, 2007 Kereluk married English rock singer-songwriter Paul Rodgers, best known for being a member of Free and Bad Company, as well as a member of The Firm and The Law. They married, after dating for ten years, at their home in British Columbia&#x27;s Okanagan Valley.

<doc id="284598" wikidata="Q193584" url="?curid=284598" title="Ministry of Magic">
<text>The Ministry of Magic is the government of the British wizarding community in the fictional universe of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; for Britain and Ireland. It is led by an official called the Minister for Magic, and is first mentioned in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. Throughout the novels, it is regularly depicted as corrupt, elitist and completely incompetent, with its high-ranking officials blind to ominous events and unwilling to take action against threats to wizard society. In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Dolores Umbridge was placed at Hogwarts to observe the happenings within the school (acting as a ministry plant), and prevent the spread of news concerning the return of Lord Voldemort. It reaches a zenith of corruption, before being effectively taken over by Voldemort. At the end of the final book, following Voldemort&#x27;s death, Kingsley Shacklebolt is revealed to have become the Minister for Magic.

==Composition and status==

===Connection to Muggle world===
Each new Muggle Prime Minister receives a visit from the Minister for Magic, who informs them of the existence of the wizarding world. The Minister explains that they will contact the Prime Minister only in circumstances in which the events of the wizarding world may affect Muggles. For example, the Minister has to inform the Prime Minister if dangerous magical artefacts or animals are to be brought into the UK.

===Government structure===
The post of Minister for Magic is stated to be an elected position, but who has the power to elect or dismiss ministers is never explained. In the books, employment with the Ministry can be obtained right after completion of a wizarding education, though different offices require different levels of education and sometimes specific exam results with some extra training required within the department itself.

===Judicial system and corruption===
In the books and films, the wizarding courts have displayed at times, a marked lack of interest in evidence for or against a suspect. All of the accused are given trials, as in the case of Buckbeak. In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, the Ministry is shown to be quite prepared to decree and enforce laws without notice. At times, the Ministry can also seem uninterested in solving serious problems, choosing instead, to ignore or cover up bad news. In &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, Fudge takes a long time to respond to the attacks on Hogwarts; and even then is sure that Rubeus Hagrid is causing the trouble rather than someone else. In the fourth and fifth instalments, Fudge refuses to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned, despite mounting evidence. The Ministry even mounts a campaign to damage Harry Potter&#x27;s credibility, an effort fuelled in part by Fudge&#x27;s fear that Albus Dumbledore wants to forcibly remove him from his position. Eventually, the Ministry is forced to acknowledge the emergency and act on it. Fudge is subsequently removed from office for incompetence and replaced by Rufus Scrimgeour.

==Departments==

===Department of Magical Law Enforcement===
The Department of Magical Law Enforcement is a combination of police and justice facilities. It is located on the second level of the Ministry of Magic. Bartemius Crouch Sr. once headed the department, prior to the first book. At the beginning of the series, it is headed by Amelia Bones, who is replaced by Pius Thicknesse after Voldemort murders her. Thicknesse is replaced by Corban Yaxley after Voldemort has Thicknesse appointed the puppet Minister for his regime. By the events of &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&quot;, Harry Potter has become its head.

According to Rowling, this is the department that Hermione joins, after the events of the seventh book, transferring from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, where she began her post-Hogwarts career.

====Auror Office====
The Ministry employs Aurors to pursue and apprehend Dark wizards. A potential recruit also has to pass &quot;a series of character and aptitude tests.&quot; Nymphadora Tonks mentions that the program&#x27;s courses of study include &quot;Concealment and Disguise&quot; and &quot;Stealth and Tracking,&quot; and that the training is hard to pass with high marks.

Aurors in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series include Alastor Moody, Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt, John Dawlish, Frank and Alice Longbottom and Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry himself later joins the department, and, according to a Rowling 2007 interview, is eventually promoted to department head.

During the First War against Voldemort, Aurors had authorisation to use the Unforgivable Curses on suspected Death Eaters: that is, they received licence to kill, coerce, and torture them. Aurors also operate to protect high-profile targets such as Harry, Hogwarts, and the Muggle prime minister – in &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; auror Kingsley Shacklebolt worked secretly in the Muggle Prime Minister&#x27;s security detail.

====Improper Use of Magic Office====
The Improper Use of Magic Office is responsible for investigating offences under the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery and the International Confederation of Wizards&#x27; Statute of Secrecy. They regulate an underage wizard&#x27;s or witch&#x27;s use of magic and prohibit wizards and witches from performing magic in the presence of Muggles or in a Muggle-inhabited area in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe. An enchantment called &quot;the Trace&quot; is placed upon children and helps the department detect offences; it ends when they reach the age of 17. However, Dumbledore explains to Harry that the Ministry cannot tell who exactly uses magic in a given area, only that it &quot;has&quot; been used. This can be seen as unfair to young witches and wizards who grew up in the Muggle world (such as Muggle-born wizards, or those with one magical and one Muggle parent) as they are more likely to be caught using magic than those who grow up in the wizarding world. Those living in the Muggle world generally have no contact with other witches or wizards away from school, and the Ministry simply presumes that any magic performed where they are is an act of underage wizardry, while at the same time presuming that any magic performed in a wizard home that has minors present was performed by those aged 17 and over. This means that minors living in the wizard world have a much greater chance of escaping punishment for the use of underage magic. The Ministry has to rely on wizard and witch parents to enforce the ban on under-age magic within their homes.

It is not known how or when the Trace is placed upon a child, though it may be assumed that it begins either when the child begins to show magical talent or when they first go through the barrier to Platform 9¾. A number of witches and wizards, including Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Lily Evans, and Severus Snape all known to have performed some underage magic while growing up in the Muggle world that went unpunished.

After Harry&#x27;s first minor violation – a Hover charm that was actually performed by Dobby the House-elf – he is merely warned. His second violation, inflating Aunt Marge, is forgiven by Fudge because the Minister fears that Sirius Black is after Harry, and feels that his safety after running away from the Dursleys takes precedence. After his third offence (creating a Patronus to protect himself and Dudley from two Dementors), the letter sent to him states that he is expelled from school; that representatives will arrive at his home to destroy his wand; and that he is required to appear at a disciplinary hearing given that the offence occurred after he had already received one warning. Dumbledore reminds Fudge that the Ministry doesn&#x27;t have the power to expel students from Hogwarts, or to confiscate wands without benefit of a hearing.

At Harry&#x27;s hearing, he is tried by the entire Wizengamot court and cleared of all charges thanks to Dumbledore&#x27;s intervention. Such proceedings are highly unusual, however. For a simple case of underage use of magic, Harry was originally supposed to be interviewed solely by Amelia Bones, head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

====Wizengamot====
The Wizengamot serves as the wizard high court of law, from the words &quot;wizard&quot; and &quot;Witenagemot&quot;, which was a council of powerful people summoned to advise and appoint kings in Anglo-Saxon England. That word derives from the Old English for &quot;meeting of wise men&quot; (&quot;witan&quot; – wise man or counsellor / &quot;gemot&quot; – assembly).

In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, about fifty people are present at Harry&#x27;s hearing. During the hearing, the Minister for Magic sits in the middle of the front row and conducts most of the interrogation, while Percy Weasley (the Junior Undersecretary), acts as stenographer. Other officials seen at the Wizengamot include the Senior Undersecretary to the Minister and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.

Dumbledore had held the position of Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot for about 50 years. He was removed at the beginning of the &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; novel and reinstated at the end. He remained in that post for one year, until his death at the end of &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;.

====Other offices====
Other offices include the Magical Law Enforcement Squad, which pursues day-to-day law offences; the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, headed by Perkins, and the job in which the reader first sees Arthur Weasley; and the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects Office, created by Rufus Scrimgeour in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;, into which Mr Weasley is promoted, to be its head.

===Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes===
The Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes is responsible for repairing accidental magical damage in the world of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. It is located on the third level of the Ministry of Magic and houses the following offices:
* The Accidental Magic Reversal Squad is a squad of wizards whose job it is to reverse &quot;accidental magic.&quot; These accidents are normally caused by young witches and wizards who have not learned to control their magic. They may also be caused by older wizards out of control, or severe, unintentional effects of charms or spells, such as &quot;splinching&quot; (in Apparition when a wizard or witch is split with one part remaining at the point of origin, and the rest of the wizard at the destination). For instance, two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad were sent out in the &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; book and movie when Harry Potter inflated Aunt Marge; they &quot;deflated&quot; her and erased her memory of the inflation (the memory modification done by Obliviators).
* The Obliviator Headquarters. &quot;Obliviator&quot; is the designation for a Ministry of Magic employee who has the task of modifying the memory of a Muggle who witnesses incidents belonging to the Wizarding world. They are first called so in the sixth volume, although the practice is mentioned in the previous novels: any wizard can modify memories in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books by using the spell &quot;Obliviate&quot;. They were sent out in the third book when after they deflated Aunt Marge, they erased her memory of the incident.
* The Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee explains any major magical accidents to the Muggles by creating a non-magical reason for the accident. For example, Peter Pettigrew killed twelve Muggle bystanders and tore apart the street (so as to reach the sewer pipe and escape) by means of an immense explosion curse during his altercation with Sirius Black. The massive and obvious damage and mortality was explained by the committee as due to a tragic accidental explosion of the gas main.

===Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures===
As noted in &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;, the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures is divided into three divisions: the Beast Division, the Being Division, and the Spirit Division. It is also noted that Hermione began her post-Hogwarts career here before transferring to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement in this office. It is located on the fourth level of the Ministry of Magic.

===Department of International Magical Cooperation===
The Department of International Magical Cooperation is an agency that attempts to get wizards from different countries to co-operate in wizarding actions both political and public. This department on the fifth level of the Ministry of Magic includes the headquarters of the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law, and the British seats of the International Confederation of Wizards. The former head was Barty Crouch Sr., until his death. This is also where Percy Weasley began his Ministry career. This department is similar in function to the real-life Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom, and various organs of the United Nations.

===Department of Magical Transportation===
The Department of Magical Transportation is responsible for various aspects of magical transport. It is located on the sixth level of the Ministry of Magic and includes the following offices: the Floo Network Authority, responsible for setting up and maintaining the network, and distributing the greenish floo powder; the Broom Regulatory Control, that controls the traffic of broom travel; the Portkey Office, the regulation of Portkeys; and the Apparition Test Centre, that grants licences to witches and wizards so that they can apparate.

===Department of Magical Games and Sports===
The Department of Magical Games and Sports organises events like the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament. Ludo Bagman used to be the Head of Department here, but his gambling problem forced him to flee from Goblin creditors. The department is located on the seventh level of the Ministry of Magic, and includes the British and Irish Quidditch League Headquarters, Official Gobstones Club, and the Ludicrous Patents Office – other sports and games-related aspects of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; world.

===Department of Mysteries===
The Department of Mysteries is a department which studies particular enigmas (death, time, space, thought, and love) and stores copies of prophecies made in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; universe. During Voldemort&#x27;s discriminatory regime, he forces the department to lie and claim that Muggle-borns actually steal magic from Pure-bloods, which makes them &quot;illegal magicals&quot; and allows their arrest.

The rooms at the Department include:
====Unspeakables====
The Unspeakables are the group of wizards who work in the Department of Mysteries (their identities classified for security reasons). Known Unspeakables include Broderick Bode, Croaker, and Augustus Rookwood who is a Death Eater.

==Ministry officials==
The following characters are notable Ministry of Magic officials. Yaxley is listed under Death Eaters.

===Ludo Bagman===
Ludovic &quot;Ludo&quot; Bagman is a retired professional Quidditch player. He was the head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports. Rowling uses Dumbledore&#x27;s Pensieve to reveal in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; that Bagman was accused of being a Death Eater about thirteen years before the events of the fourth book because he had given information to recently discovered Death Eater Augustus Rookwood. It is stated that he had believed Rookwood, who was his father&#x27;s friend, to be beyond suspicion, and that, consequently, he had thought that he was aiding the Ministry by passing the information on to him.

Bagman loves gambling, which got him in financial trouble so severe that he pays some of his creditors with disappearing Leprechaun Gold, after they have gambled on the Quidditch World Cup. After the World Cup final, some goblins corner him in the woods outside the stadium and take all the gold he had on him, which is not enough to cover his debts. To clear his debts with the goblins, Bagman makes a bet on the Triwizard Tournament, of which he is one of the judges. He bets the goblins that Harry would win. He tries to help Harry over the course of the Tournament, giving him a perfect score in the First Task even though he is injured, and offering him advice. Harry and Cedric Diggory end up tying for first place in the tournament, and Bagman does not win the bet as the goblins argue that Bagman was betting Harry would win outright. Bagman runs away after the Third Task of the Tournament. Bagman appears in the &quot;Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup&quot; video game as a Quidditch announcer.

===Barty Crouch Sr.===
Bartemius &quot;Barty&quot; Crouch Sr. was the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement when Voldemort first came to power. He sent Sirius Black to the wizard prison Azkaban without a trial. Crouch appeared to be the favourite to become the next Minister for Magic until his son, Barty Crouch Jr., was caught with the Lestranges, Death Eaters who were assisting Voldemort&#x27;s rise to power and who had tortured Neville Longbottom&#x27;s parents into insanity with the Cruciatus Curse. Crouch gave his son a trial before sending him to Azkaban; however, according to Sirius, the trial was a sham, merely a public demonstration of how much he hated the boy. The public were sympathetic to Crouch Jr., and placed all the blame on Crouch Sr., accusing him of driving his son to join the Death Eaters because of his parental neglect. After the trial, Crouch lost much of his popularity and any chance he had of becoming Minister of Magic, and he was shunted sideways to a post as the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation.

About a year after the trial, Crouch&#x27;s terminally ill wife begged for her son&#x27;s life to be saved, so Crouch abetted the two in trading appearances using Polyjuice Potion. Mrs. Crouch died as Crouch Jr. in Azkaban, while Crouch Sr. subsequently used the Imperius Curse to keep Crouch Jr. under house arrest. When Bertha Jorkins discovered the truth, Crouch Sr. silenced her with a powerful Memory Charm that permanently damaged her memory.

Shortly thereafter, Voldemort and Peter Pettigrew show up at the Crouch family home, having found out about Crouch Jr. from interrogating Jorkins. Voldemort places Crouch Sr. under the Imperius Curse, freeing Crouch Jr. from the Imperius Curse placed on him by his father, and forces Crouch to continue to appear in public as if there is nothing wrong. While still under the Imperius Curse, Crouch Sr. acts as one of the five judges at the Triwizard Tournament. However, worried that Crouch will fight off the effects of the Imperius Curse, Voldemort later has him imprisoned within his own house and has him communicate exclusively through supervised owl post. Despite this precaution, Crouch manages to break free of the Imperius Curse, and makes his way to Hogwarts, hoping to warn Dumbledore of what is happening, running into Harry and Viktor Krum in the Forbidden Forest. However, while Harry is on his way to summon Dumbledore, he unwittingly alerts Crouch Jr., who is using Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Mad-Eye Moody, to his father&#x27;s presence. Crouch Jr. immediately goes to the forest, stuns Krum, kills his own father, transfigures the body into a bone, and buries it on the Hogwarts grounds.

Roger Lloyd-Pack appeared as Crouch Sr. in the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;.

===John Dawlish===
John Dawlish is an Auror. He is described as a &quot;tough-looking wizard&quot; with &quot;very short, wiry&quot; grey hair.

In &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Dawlish accompanies Fudge to Hogwarts to confront Harry about the secret Dumbledore&#x27;s Army meetings. Dawlish is knocked out along with Fudge, Umbridge, and Kingsley when Dumbledore, who takes all the blame for the Army on himself, escapes. A few weeks later, Dawlish is among the wizards who attempt to arrest Hagrid when Umbridge sacks the gamekeeper. Dawlish appears again in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; guarding Hogwarts after the commencement of the Second War. He is sent to follow Dumbledore when the Headmaster leaves school to search for Voldemort&#x27;s Horcruxes, but is &quot;regretfully&quot; hexed by the Headmaster. He is Confunded by an Order member early on in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;, and gives Death Eater Corban Yaxley false information on Harry&#x27;s removal from the Dursleys&#x27; home. Being Confunded, he is defeated by Dirk Cresswell, who escapes halfway on the way to Azkaban. Later, Dawlish is sent to arrest Augusta Longbottom. After a struggle, her defence places Dawlish in St Mungo&#x27;s Hospital.

Dawlish&#x27;s first name is not revealed in the books or films. However, Rowling said in an interview with the podcast &quot;PotterCast&quot; that she named him John, owing to host John Noe&#x27;s appreciation of the character.

Dawlish is portrayed by Richard Leaf in the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;.

===Cornelius Fudge===

Cornelius Fudge is first mentioned in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; as the Minister for Magic of the United Kingdom. He makes his first appearance in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, when he arrives at Hogwarts to take Hagrid to Azkaban. He also removes Dumbledore as Headmaster when pressured by Lucius Malfoy who insisted that all the school governors had voted on it. However, it is not until &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; that Fudge meets Harry for the first time. Fudge does not press charges against Harry for accidentally inflating Aunt Marge, and advises him to be careful because an escaped convict is at large. When Fudge goes for a social drink at the Three Broomsticks pub, he inadvertently tells an unseen Harry that Sirius was James Potter&#x27;s best friend and was believed to have betrayed the Potters to Voldemort.

His kindly relationship to Harry abruptly changes in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. When Harry emerges from the Triwizard Tournament&#x27;s third task after having seen the rebirth of Voldemort, Fudge refuses to believe it. He is worried about the fallout of announcing Voldemort&#x27;s return, marking the end of the Wizarding world&#x27;s years of peace, and the sudden outbreak of gloom and terror; hence he decides to merely ignore all of the evidence rather than accept the truth. J. K. Rowling has since stated that Fudge&#x27;s behaviour mirrors that of Neville Chamberlain in the lead-up to World War II.

In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Fudge orchestrates a vicious smear campaign through the &quot;Daily Prophet&quot; to present Dumbledore as a senile old fool and Harry as an unstable, attention-seeking liar. He also passes a law allowing him to place Dolores Umbridge, his Senior Undersecretary, as a teacher at Hogwarts. He then appoints Umbridge as Hogwarts&#x27; &quot;High Inquisitor&quot;, with the power to inspect and fire teachers, and ultimately Dumbledore&#x27;s successor as Headmaster, which gives her primary control of how Hogwarts is managed. Fudge is concerned that Dumbledore is a threat to his power and that he is planning to train the Hogwarts students to overthrow the Ministry.

After Voldemort appears in the Ministry of Magic at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Fudge finally admits that Voldemort has returned. He is ousted by the wizarding community for his failure to announce the return of Voldemort immediately after the Triwizard Competition; for discrediting Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore; and for installing Dolores Umbridge as Headmistress of Hogwarts. He is replaced by Rufus Scrimgeour, though he stays on as a powerless advisor and messenger to the Prime Minister in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Fudge is portrayed by Robert Hardy in the film series.

===Bertha Jorkins===
Bertha Jorkins was a student at Hogwarts at the same time as James Potter. She became a Ministry of Magic employee after leaving Hogwarts. In the summer before the events of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot;, she was killed by Voldemort. Rowling later revealed that her death was used to turn Nagini, Voldemort&#x27;s snake, into a Horcrux.

===Rufus Scrimgeour===

Rufus Scrimgeour serves as the Minister for Magic of the United Kingdom from &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; until his death in the following book, succeeding Cornelius Fudge. He is described as looking like an old lion with tawny hair and bushy eyebrows, yellow eyes and wire-rimmed spectacles. Before being selected as minister, Scrimgeour headed the Auror Office of the Ministry and he is heavily battle-scarred from his years of service as an Auror, giving him an appearance of shrewd toughness. As the Minister, he visits the Muggle Prime Minister to inform him about important wizarding events, crucial to internal security.

Scrimgeour was more concerned about the Ministry&#x27;s reputation than seeing the danger the Death Eaters and Voldemort posed to the wizarding world. He tried to make it look like the Ministry was making progress by covering up breakouts from Azkaban and arresting random suspects such as Stan Shunpike – although later on Shunpike is in fact shown to have joined the Death Eaters, albeit ironically as a direct result of his being arrested in the first place. He also sought to raise the wizarding population&#x27;s morale by asking Harry, who has been labelled as the &quot;Chosen One&quot;, to be seen visiting the Ministry, so that the public would believe that Harry supports the Ministry&#x27;s actions against Voldemort. Harry also rejects that role, primarily because of his own antagonistic history with the Ministry and because of the Ministry&#x27;s treatment of Dumbledore.

Scrimgeour makes a short appearance in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot; as the executor of Dumbledore&#x27;s will. Scrimgeour is assassinated shortly after the visit, when the Death Eaters take over the Ministry through a coup. Harry felt a &quot;rush of gratitude&quot; to hear that Scrimgeour, in his final act, attempted to protect Harry by refusing to disclose his location.

Bill Nighy played Scrimgeour in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;, in which he is portrayed as Welsh and a more compassionate character.

===Pius Thicknesse===
Pius Thicknesse is first introduced in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot;. He is the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the start of the book, when he is placed under the Imperius Curse by Corban Yaxley, who uses his position to infiltrate the senior ranks of the Ministry. Thicknesse is described as a man with long hair and a beard, which are mostly black but tinged with some grey, along with a great overhanging forehead and glinting eyes. Harry&#x27;s immediate impression is of &quot;a crab looking out from beneath a rock.&quot;

After the coup in which Scrimgeour is killed, the Ministry comes under the de facto control of Voldemort, who appoints Thicknesse as his puppet Minister. Thicknesse joins the ranks of the Death Eaters for the rest of the book and fights with them at the Battle of Hogwarts, where he duels against Percy Weasley, who resigns mid-duel. Following the end of the battle, the Imperius Curse that was placed upon him is broken. Kingsley Shacklebolt replaces him as interim (later permanent) Minister for Magic. Not much is known about the &quot;real&quot; nature of Thicknesse, as he has been under the control of Yaxley for nearly the entire book.

Guy Henry plays Thicknesse in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;, in which he is depicted as a Death Eater even before Scrimgeour&#x27;s death. However, it&#x27;s unknown if he was under the Imperius Curse, or joined out of his own free will. In &quot;Part 2&quot;, Thicknesse is killed by Voldemort.

===Dolores Umbridge===

Dolores Umbridge is a short, squat woman described as resembling a large pale toad, with &quot;short, curly, mouse-brown hair&quot;. She speaks with a quiet, childish, high-pitched voice. She has a tendency to speak to people as if they are simpletons or very young children, without having demonstrated any magical abilities to back up her superiority claims. Umbridge becomes the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor during Harry&#x27;s fifth year. Before that, Umbridge acted as Senior Undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. 

Umbridge demonstrates incredible incompetence by refusing to teach the practical component of the class for political reasons. Fudge later appoints Umbridge as &quot;Hogwarts High Inquisitor&quot;, a role which is solely symbolic, as Umbridge is unable to evict a rival professor from Hogwarts Castle and merely dictates numerous rules. She also lacks the ability to manufacture a truth potion, and falsely believes that Albus Dumbledore seeks a political coup against Minister for Magic Fudge. 

During the events of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Umbridge adopts a new title: Head of the &quot;Muggle-Born Registration Commission&quot;, from 1997–1998. This Commission conducted unethical trials against &quot;muggle-born&quot; witches and wizards before being disassembled by Interim Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt. 

Rowling has confirmed via the fan site PotterMore that Umbridge is canonically placed in Azkaban, the Wizarding Prison, after the fall of Voldemort&#x27;s corrupt Ministry. Fans of the Harry Potter series typically detest Umbridge because of her egregious conduct throughout the books and movies.

===Percy Weasley ===
Percy Weasley is the third son of Arthur and Molly Weasley. In direct contrast to his brothers, he is a stickler for rules and often pompous due to his love of authority, though he does have good intentions at heart. When readers first meet Percy in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, he is a Gryffindor prefect, and in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, he becomes Head Boy. In both these circumstances, he becomes physically attached to his badge, wanting to polish it and wear it even when out of school. Percy is an academically high-performing student. When he finishes school, this academic distinction plus his having served as Head Boy secures him a job in the Ministry in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. Percy somewhat idolises his immediate supervisor, Barty Crouch Sr. When Crouch is ill, Percy replaces him as a judge in the second Triwizard Tournament task.

In &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Percy is promoted to Junior Assistant to Minister Fudge. Since this is an unusually high-ranking position for someone of Percy&#x27;s age to hold, Arthur suspects that Percy&#x27;s promotion was not earned but instead given to him to allow the Ministry to better manipulate the Weasleys. Outraged and hurt by the suggestion, Percy violently argues with Arthur, resulting in Percy&#x27;s subsequent alienation from his family. When Percy learns Ron is made a prefect, he sends him a letter congratulating him for following in his footsteps, and unsuccessfully urges Ron to sever ties with Harry (claiming Harry is an extreme danger to Ron&#x27;s prefect status), and to pay loyalty to Umbridge and the Ministry – going so far to refer to her as a &quot;delightful woman&quot;, much to Harry&#x27;s and Ron&#x27;s disgust.

In the climax of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, Percy returns to his family and manages to make up with all of them, and eventually duels new Minister for Magic and Voldemort puppet Pius Thicknesse in the Battle of Hogwarts. While dueling Thicknesse, Percy announces that he is resigning, the first joke he has made in many years, much to Fred&#x27;s delight. Percy witnesses the death of his brother Fred at the hands of Augustus Rookwood, and Percy clings to the corpse and shields it from further damage. In the last part of the battle, he and his father work together to defeat Thicknesse.

Percy is portrayed by Chris Rankin in the film series.

===Others===
==Reception==

Jennifer Barnett of &quot;People&#x27;s Weekly World&quot; stated that the reader is drawn &quot;into the politics of the wizarding world—the &#x27;Educational Decrees&#x27; from the toad-like Ministry of Magic representative, the high-level connections of &#x27;war criminals&#x27; from the last rise of Voldemort, the prejudice against &#x27;mudbloods&#x27; and &#x27;half-breeds,&#x27;&quot; and suggested connections &quot;to the world we live in, to the similarities and differences between the Fudge administration and the Bush administration.&quot; Julia Turner of &quot;Slate Magazine&quot; also interpreted Rowling&#x27;s depiction of the ministration as criticism of the Bush and Blair administrations, suggesting the Ministry&#x27;s security pamphlet recalls the Operation TIPS (Terrorism Information and Prevention System). University of Tennessee law professor Benjamin Barton notes what he considers to be libertarian aspects of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; in his paper &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Crazed Bureaucracy&quot;, published in the &quot;Michigan Law Review&quot;, stating that &quot;Rowling&#x27;s scathing portrait of government is surprisingly strident and effective. This is partly because her critique works on so many levels: the functions of government, the structure of government, and the bureaucrats who run the show. All three elements work together to depict a Ministry of Magic run by self-interested bureaucrats bent on increasing and protecting their power, often to the detriment of the public at large. In other words, Rowling creates a public-interest scholar&#x27;s dream—or nightmare—government.&quot;

==In popular culture==
One of the most influential wizard rock bands is named Ministry of Magic after the government structure in the series. Ministry of Magic has made numerous performances, amongst the most notable of them taking place in Wrockstock.

<text>The TI-99/4 and TI-99/4A are home computers released by Texas Instruments in 1979 and 1981, respectively. 
Based on Texas Instruments&#x27;s own TMS9900 microprocessor originally used in minicomputers, the TI-99/4 was the first 16-bit home computer. The associated TMS9918 video display controller provides color graphics and sprite support which were only comparable with those of the Atari 400 and 800 released a month later. The TI-99 series also initially competed with the Apple II and TRS-80.

The calculator-style keyboard of the TI-99/4 and the high price were cited as a weak points. TI&#x27;s reliance on ROM cartridges and their practice of limiting developer information to select third parties resulted in a lack of software for the system. The TI-99/4A was released in June 1981 with a simplified internal design, full-travel keyboard, improved graphics, and a unique expansion system. At half the price of the original model, sales picked up significantly and TI supported the 4A with peripherals, including a speech synthesizer and a &quot;Peripheral Expansion System&quot; box to contain hardware add-ons. TI released developer information and tools, but the insistence on remaining sole publisher continued to starve the platform of software. Architectural quirks of both models reduced the performance benefits of the 16-bit CPU.

The 1981 US launch of the TI-99/4A followed Commodore&#x27;s VIC-20 by several months. Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel began a price war by repeatedly lowering the price of the VIC-20 and forcing TI to do the same. In late 1982, TI was shipping 5,000 computers a day from their factory in Lubbock, Texas. By 1983, the 99/4A was selling at a loss for under . Even with the increased user base created by the heavy discounts, Texas Instruments lost US$330 million in the third quarter of 1983 and announced the discontinuation of the TI-99/4A in October 1983. Production ended in March 1984.

The TI-99/4 was intended to fit in the middle of a planned range of TI-99 computers, none of which were released, but prototypes and documentation have been found after the TI-99/4A was discontinued.

==Features==

The TI-99/4A is a self-contained console with the motherboard, ROM cartridge slot, and full-travel keyboard in the same case. The power supply is external. An RF modulator allows the use of a television as a monitor. Lowercase letters are displayed as small caps, rather than separate glyphs. TI BASIC, an ANSI-compliant BASIC interpreter based on Dartmouth BASIC, is built-in and includes support for graphics, sound, and file system access. Later versions of the 99/4A, identified by codice_1 on the title page, prevent the use of unlicensed ROM cartridges from third-party manufacturers such as Atarisoft.

Both TI-99/4 models use the 16-bit TMS9900 CPU running at 3 MHz. The TMS9900 is a single-chip implementation of a TI-990 minicomputer. Although a full 16-bit processor, only the system ROM and 256 bytes of scratchpad RAM are available on the 16-bit bus.

Peripherals include a 5¼&quot; floppy disk drive and controller, an RS-232 card with two serial ports and one parallel port, a P-code card for Pascal support, a thermal printer, a 300-baud acoustic coupler, a tape drive using standard audio cassettes as media, and a 32 KB memory expansion card.

===Video display processor===
Graphics in the 99/4A are generated by a TMS9918A Video Display Processor (VDP), with a variant for PAL territories. The VDP was developed by Texas Instruments and also sold independently, allowing it to be used in other systems. It serves as the video processor for the ColecoVision and SG-1000 consoles, and an earlier model is part of the MSX computer standard.

The TMS9918A supports character-based and bitmap display modes as well as hardware sprites. There are 32 single-color sprites total, but only a maximum of 4 can be displayed per scan line. Each sprite is either 8×8 or 16×16 pixels and can be scaled 2× to 16×16 or 32×32.

16 KB of RAM is provided for the Video Display Processor. VDP RAM is the largest block of writeable memory in the unexpanded TI-99/4A architecture, and is used for storing disk I/O buffers and
TI BASIC user programs. Access to this memory has to use the VDP as an intermediary.

==Expansion==
TI-99 peripherals contain device drivers in ROMs in the hardware. When a new peripheral is attached, it is immediately available for any software that wants to use it. All device access uses a generic file-based I/O mechanism, allowing new devices to be added without updating software. The Peripheral Expansion System can hold two RS-232 cards, for a total of four RS-232 ports and two parallel printer ports.

The computer supports two cassette drives through a dedicated port, using a custom data format. Composite video and audio are output through another port on NTSC-based machines, and combine through an external RF modulator for use with a television. PAL-based machines output a more complex YUV signal which is also modulated to UHF externally.

Two digital joysticks can be connected through a single DE-9 port. It is identical to the Atari joystick port, but with incompatible pins. Aftermarket adapters allow the use of Atari compatible joysticks.

TI sold an official 32 KB RAM expansion. The memory is not available to all uses. For example, an Extended Basic program is restricted to using 24 KB with the remaining 8 KB available for machine code routines. The Mini Memory plug-in module contains 4 KB of battery-backed RAM that can be used as a persistent RAM disk or to load a machine-code program.

===Peripheral Expansion Box===
The TI-99/4A can be upgraded via expansion cards added to an eight-slot, external chassis containing its own linear power supply and a full-height 5¼&quot; floppy bay. Encased in silver plastic, but made from sheet steel, this is labeled as the Peripheral Expansion System by TI, but usually called the Peripheral Expansion Box or PEB. Each card has an LED that blinks or flickers when being accessed by software. The section of the power supply that powers the card slots is unregulated. Each card has on-board regulators for its own requirements, which reduces power consumption on a partially-loaded PEB, allowing for cards with unusual voltage requirements.

The PEB carries an analog sound input on the expansion bus, allowing the Speech Synthesizer&#x27;s audio to be carried through the console to the monitor. The audio is also carried through the ribbon cable to the PEB, both allowing the relocation of the Speech Synthesizer to the PEB and the possibility of audio cards offering more features than the console&#x27;s built-in sound. No official cards from TI do this.

Official cards from TI that were released and could be placed inside the PEB include
* 32 KB RAM expansion card
* RS-232 and parallel port card
* P-code card, implementing the UCSD p-system IV.0 by acting as a ROM-disk
* Diskette drive control card. The design allowed controlling both drives internally in the PEB and external drives.

Peripherals designed to be used without the PEB existed too.

===Speech synthesizer===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, TI was a pioneer in speech synthesis because of its Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips which were used in its Speak &amp; Spell toys. A plug-in speech synthesizer module was available for the TI-99/4 and 4A. Speech synthesizers were offered free with the purchase of a number of cartridges and were used by video games such as &quot;Alpiner&quot; and &quot;Parsec&quot;. &quot;Alpiner&quot;″s speech includes male and female voices and can be sarcastic when the player makes a bad move.

The synthesizer uses a variant of linear predictive coding and has a small in-built vocabulary. The original intent was to release small cartridges that plugged directly into the synthesizer unit to increase the device&#x27;s vocabulary. However, the success of software text-to-speech in the Terminal Emulator II cartridge cancelled that plan.

==History==
In 1977, groups within Texas Instruments were designing a video game console, a home computer to compete against the TRS-80 and Apple II, and a high-end business personal computer with a hard drive. The first two groups were both working at TI&#x27;s consumer products division in Lubbock, Texas, and continually competed. According to Wally Rhines, the 99/4&#x27;s &quot;ultracheap keyboard&quot; (with calculator-style keys), RF modulator, and ROM cartridges came from the console design. Eventually, the two teams were merged and directed towards the home computer market. Meanwhile, the third team was merged into TI&#x27;s Data Systems Division, which had a line of minicomputer products and various computer terminals; they viewed the all-in-one machine as a threat and the project was eventually killed.

Others within the company persuaded the Lubbock group to use TI&#x27;s TMS9900 CPU. This was in keeping with TI&#x27;s &quot;one company, one computer architecture&quot; concept, where a single processor model would scale from consoles to its high-end minicomputers. The TMS9900 is a single-chip implementation of TI&#x27;s 16-bit TI-990 mini design, and is the CPU in low-end models of that platform. Feature-limited single-chip versions of popular minicomputer designs from the 1960s were popular in the mid-1970s and newly designed 16-bit and 32-bit CPUs like the Intel 8088 and Motorola 68000, respectively, quickly rendered these earlier designs obsolete. Many of the TMS9900&#x27;s quirky features, like processor registers in main memory, came from its minicomputer roots where such concepts were more common.

Meanwhile, another home computer product was emerging from TI&#x27;s European headquarters, where a third party consulting firm was contracted to produce a prototype codenamed &quot;Mojo&quot;. This was based on TI&#x27;s version of the 8-bit Intel 8080 supported by an all-TI chip set. After a series of discussions, Mojo was abandoned and the Consumer Products concept moved forward.

===99/4===
In 1979, TI was a successful manufacturer of large computers and was the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the world. Its catalog included a huge variety of analog and digital integrated circuits already widely used in microcomputers, giving it a single-source advantage no other company could meet. It used this position to take over markets, as it did in the mid-1970s introducing its first scientific calculators. These underpriced its former customers like Commodore and drove them out of the calculator business. Observers expected TI would do the same to the microcomputer market if it released a competitive system. &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that the entry of TI and Hewlett-Packard would reshape the entire industry.

Through the development period, several companies attempting to enter the home computer market were faced with significant pushback from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC had developed new rules for consumer devices that connected directly to televisions in an effort to control ongoing complaints about interference by poorly shielded devices. Televisions of the era generally had only a single antenna input, and thus connecting to them required the internal video signal of the device to be converted to radio frequency using an RF modulator. The resulting signals were often poorly shielded and signal leakage could be picked up in the antennas of nearby televisions.

The new rules were extremely difficult to meet. TI continued battling the FCC both in the lab and in Congress, where it had considerable power due to its position within Texas&#x27;s high-tech industry. It failed to meet the FCC requirements as the release date approached. The company eventually gave up and bundled a modified Zenith Electronics television as a computer monitor, eliminating the need for the RF modulator that generates the interference by connecting directly to the TV&#x27;s circuitry using a composite video signal. This put the introductory price at .

The 99/4 sold poorly. Very little software was available, as few developers ported their products to its 16-bit CPU. The machine was met with almost universal disdain when it was released. Every review complained about the keyboard, the lack of lower case characters, any sort of expansion, and lack of software. In July 1980, Adam Osborne reported that, despite poor sales, TI had raised the price of a complete system to , higher than the popular Apple II, which started at . Osborne said, &quot;Some dealers, who have offered the complete system (including the monitor) for less than the price of the Apple, have still been unable to sell it&quot;. TI experimented with $200 rebates, and dealers decreased the price to as low as $699 not including rebates, but the company sold fewer than 20,000 computers by summer 1981, less than one tenth Apple or Radio Shack&#x27;s volume. Atari, Inc. had an installed base of Atari 8-bit computers more than twice as large. David H. Ahl described the 99/4 as &quot;vastly overpriced, particularly considering its strange keyboard, non-standard Basic, and lack of software&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; called it an &quot;embarrassing failure&quot;.

===99/4A===
In May 1981 TI released the 99/4A. With a lower $525 price, the company added a typewriter-style keyboard—keeping the non-standard layout—and more expansion options. The expansion system extends from the right side of the chassis, with modules that can be daisy-chained. There is a practical limitation to this, because each module increases the width of the system. The price was initially , less than half that of the 99/4.

TI continued lowering the price through 1981, first to , and then to in early 1982, in competition with Commodore&#x27;s VIC-20. This turned into a price war with Commodore. TI responded by cutting the wholesale price of the 99 by , while also offering a rebate directly to consumers, lowering the street price to about . Bill Cosby in advertising for TI marketed the refund. By mid-1982, Jerry Pournelle wrote that TI was &quot;practically giving away the TI-99/4A&quot;. An industry joke stated that the company was losing money on each computer, but was making up for it in volume. Commodore matched the price in December 1982.

TI celebrated the 99/4A&#x27;s market success at the January 1983 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where Cosby joked how easy it was to sell a computer by paying people to buy one. Sales peaked at 30,000 a week that month, but on 10 January 1983 Commodore lowered the price of its computers. In February TI responded with a 99/4A retail price of . In April, the VIC-20&#x27;s bundled retail price reached and the 99/4A followed suit. In the spring of 1983, TI attempted to reduce the parts count to maintain a competitive edge by combining multiple chips into a single custom chip, renaming the 4A PCB as a &quot;QI&quot; (Quality Improved) board and began production of plastic beige cases without the former aluminum trim of the black console. In May, it began offering the PEB for free with the purchase of three peripherals. In August the company reduced prices of peripherals by 50% and offered of free software; in September, it reduced software prices by up to 43%. The $100 rebate ended in April 1983, but by then TI had effectively reduced the retail price by that amount; by June the 99/4A sold for as little as $99 in some stores, comparable to the VIC-20&#x27;s price.

===Lack of third-party development===
The president of Spectravideo later said that &quot;TI got suckered by&quot; Jack Tramiel, head of Commodore. The company could not make a profit on the TI-99/4A at a price of $99—it was much more expensive to manufacture than the VIC-20—but hoped that selling many inexpensive computers would increase sales of more profitable software and peripherals. Because such a razor and blades business model requires that such products be its own, TI strictly controlled development for the computer, discouraging hobbyists and third-party developers. It wanted unsophisticated consumers to buy its computers like an appliance, and not technical users who might want to write their own software, despite the latter being what Pournelle described as &quot;a large unpaid R&amp;D department&quot; for computer companies. The company advertised its calculators in almost every issue of &quot;BYTE&quot; starting in 1980, but deliberately excluded its home computer from the ads except briefly in late 1982. TI also used its preexisting calculator sales channel of mass-market retailers, and not specialized computer stores.

TI did not provide an editor, assembler, or hardware technical information when it released the computer. Pournelle stated that &quot;TI&#x27;s message is loud and clear: &#x27;Drop dead, hobbyists!, and added that the company &quot;worked very hard at keeping you outside the machine&quot;. Citing &quot;Money&quot;, publisher of &quot;Kilobaud Microcomputing&quot; Wayne Green reported in August 1980 that TI planned to have only 100 applications available by the end of 1981, stating that &quot;This tiny figure has to put a chill on the whole industry&quot;. Green&#x27;s company, Instant Software, was a prolific publisher for the TRS-80 but could not find anyone to port software to the TI. He wrote, &quot;We understand the problems with the system and the efforts Texas Instruments made to make translation difficult&quot;. A Spinnaker Software executive said that the 99/4A had &quot;the worst software in the business&quot;, and Ahl noted that unlike other computers, it did not have &quot;Microsoft BASIC, VisiCalc, WordStar, or any popular games&quot;. Peripherals cost about twice as much as for other computers. TI joysticks were of poor quality and difficult to find, for example; one reseller reported that its best-selling product was the Atari CX40 joystick adapter cable.

Pournelle added, &quot;TI had rightly concluded that the hobbyists and hackers were a tiny part of the market and &quot;wrongly&quot; concluded that they were therefore unimportant&quot;. Rivals were more open with information. &quot;Kilobaud Microcomputing&quot; reported that a Commodore executive promised the VIC-20 would have &quot;enough additional documentation to enable an experienced programmer/hobbyist to get inside and let his imagination work&quot;. Even when competitors did not disclose technical information, because their computers used commercial off-the-shelf parts like MOS 6502 and Zilog Z80, much more information was public than for TI&#x27;s proprietary components. IBM learned from TI&#x27;s mistake, Pournelle said. The company released software and hardware technical information when the IBM PC was announced in 1981, stating that &quot;the definition of a personal computer &quot;is&quot; third-party hardware and software&quot;.

TI had also learned from its mistake and no longer ignored hobbyists, Pournelle said in 1982. The company advertised in &quot;BYTE&quot; its program for publishing others&#x27; software, and job openings for software developers. By mid-1983 more than 1000 applications were available. TI insisted on being the sole publisher for the system, however, which many developers refused to agree to. After third-party developers&#x27; games for the Atari 2600 became very successful, the company at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show announced that only cartridges with a TI-licensed lockout chip would work in the 99/4A. TI held a patent on a program counter implemented in software in GROM, which a future 99/4A operating system revision would require in cartridges. The &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; predicted that &quot;most [software developers] just won&#x27;t bother making TI-compatible versions of their programs&quot;, and Pournelle wrote that &quot;TI once again tells the hobbyists to drop dead&quot;.

No official technical documentation from TI was released until the &quot;Editor/Assembler&quot; development suite was announced in 1981 and released in 1982, and no system schematics were ever released to the public until after TI had discontinued the computer.

===Discontinuation===
After TI in mid-1983 unexpectedly announced a loss in the second calendar quarter—implying a pretax loss from home computers of —its stock dropped by one third in two days. The &quot;Times&quot; stated in June 1983 that Cosby&#x27;s refund &quot;joke is no longer funny&quot;, and that &quot;future options are slim&quot;. The low price affected the 99/4A&#x27;s reputation; &quot;When they went to , people started asking &#x27;What&#x27;s wrong with it?&#x27;&quot;, one retail executive said. An L.F. Rothschild sell-side analyst estimated that TI had prepared to manufacture three million computers in 1983, but would only be able to sell two million; another analyst forecast one million for the year.

Some observers predicted after the second quarter&#x27;s loss that the 99/4A would not be able to recover; even if the company did not plan to discontinue the computer, the fear that it would become orphaned technology might cause retailers to avoid ordering inventory. Others thought that TI could sell excess inventory and continue producing the computer. After losing after taxes in the third calendar quarter of 1983, TI announced plans to discontinue the 99/4A, while continuing to sell the TI Professional MS-DOS-compatible computer. (TI stock rose by 25% after the announcement, because the company&#x27;s other businesses were strong.) With another TI price cut, retailers sold remaining inventory of the former computer during Christmas for $49. The 90 Child World stores quickly sold over 40,000 computers at a price referred to as &quot;nearly a stocking stuffer&quot; in a &quot;Times&quot; article.

A total of 2.8 million units were shipped before the TI-99/4A was discontinued in March 1984, perhaps the largest installed base among all personal computers. The 99/4A became the first in a series of home computers to be orphaned by their manufacturer over the next few years, along with the Coleco Adam, Mattel Aquarius, Timex Sinclair 1000, and IBM PCjr.

==Architecture==
In order to build a complete 16-bit system, TI would have had to redesign many of their existing 8-bit support chips. Instead, TI decided to use existing devices for the majority of the system. The result is that only a small portion of the system is 16-bit and uses a second 8-bit computer bus for the rest.

One of the key features of the TMS9900 from the minicomputer design that spawned it is the inclusion of several sets of processor registers. In a minicomputer setting, the system was typically running a time-sharing or multitasking operating system, or being used for real-time computing, both of which benefit from being able to quickly switch among programs. To do this, the TMS9900 stores several sets of registers in main memory and can switch between the sets of sixteen 16-bit registers by changing the single workspace pointer register, thereby allowing very rapid context switching.

The new design put 256 bytes of random-access memory (RAM) on the 16-bit bus to store up to eight sets of registers. This area of RAM is known as the &quot;scratchpad memory&quot;. As the processor&#x27;s instructions are all 16-bit as well, the 8 KB internal system read-only memory (ROM) was also on the 16-bit side. Only the program counter, status register, and workspace pointer registers are actually implemented on the chip itself.

Included on the 8-bit side of the system is the majority of the RAM and almost all of the support chips, especially the video display controller (VDP). All accesses to the VDP system are executed eight bits at a time. The system&#x27;s RAM is managed by the VDP, which provides access to the CPU only when the VDP is not using the memory. This means that user programs and data are read over two machine cycles, reducing speed by half. According to TI&#x27;s former manager for microprocessors who oversaw TMS9900 development, this negates the performance advantage of a 16-bit processor.

The TMS9900&#x27;s machine language instructions must be word-aligned, so at least 16-bits are needed for every instruction. At the time, memory was expensive, so the size of this format was a concern. Additionally, programming the 8-bit side of the system from 16-bit code is somewhat complex. To address this, TI developed a pseudo-assembly language known as &quot;Graphic Programming Language&quot;, or GPL. This is a compact 8-bit language interpreted by the CPU which dynamically translates the GPL instructions into one or more TMS9900 instructions. GPL includes utility routines that appear as single instructions in GPL code, such as clearing a block of memory. All software originally distributed on ROM cartridges were written using GPL, and are sometimes referred to as GROMs.

At the time of launch, the system included only a single user-accessible programming language: TI&#x27;s built-in BASIC interpreter, written in GPL. On the Creative Computing Benchmark, it runs at roughly half the speed of the Apple II.

==Technical specifications==
===CPU===
TMS9900 @ 3 MHz, 16-bit, 64-pin DIP

===Memory===
* 8 KB of monitor ROM and GPL interpreter
* 8 KB of RAM, if memory expansion is attached
* 8 KB allocated to expansion devices (e.g. disk drive controller)
* 8 KB allocated to ROM/RAM in expansion cartridges
*256 bytes scratchpad RAM for the CPU
* Memory ports for Video Display Processor, sound, speech etc.
* 24 KB RAM, if memory expansion is attached
*16 KB Video Display Processor RAM accessible via the VDP (not in CPU&#x27;s memory map)

===Video===
 TMS9918A video display processor, 40 pin DIP. The earlier 99/4 uses the TMS9918. PAL systems use the &quot;9929&quot; versions of each.
* 32 single-color sprites in defined layers allowing higher-numbered sprites to transparently flow over lower-numbered sprites. Sprites are available at 8×8 pixels or 16×16 pixels, with a &quot;magnify&quot; bit that doubled all sprites&#x27; size but not their resolution. A single bit is available in hardware for collision detection, and the console supports automatic movement via an interrupt routine in the ROM. There can only be 4 visible sprites per scan line.
* 16 fixed colors (15 visible, one color reserved for &quot;transparent&quot; which shows the background color). Transparent is intended for the 9918&#x27;s genlock which is disabled in the system.
* Text mode: 40×24 characters (256 6×8 user-definable characters, no sprites, foreground and background color only, not accessible in BASIC, standard in the p-system/Pascal, assembly editor and word processor)
* Graphics mode: 32×24 characters (256 8×8 user-definable characters), full 15 color palette + transparent (available in groups of 8 through the character table) and 32 sprites (The only mode available in BASIC. Extended BASIC is required for sprites, and can access only 28 of them.)
* Bitmap mode: 256×192 pixels (no more than two colors in an eight-pixel row, full 15 color palette + transparent, all 32 sprites available but interrupt-based motion through the ROM routine is not due to the memory layout, not available to BASIC or the original 9918).
* Multicolor mode: 64×48 pixels (each pixel may be any color, all 32 sprites are available)
* All of the above comprise 36 layers starting with the video overlay input, then the background color, then two graphics mode layers, then a layer for each of the 32 sprites. A higher layer obscures a lower layer in hardware, unless that higher layer is transparent.

===Sound===
TMS9919, later SN94624, identical to the SN76489 used in many other systems
* 3 voices, 1 noise (white or periodic)
* Voices generate square waves from 110 Hz to approximately 115 kHz
* Console ROM includes interrupt-driven music playback

==Games==

Roughly 100 games were published for the TI-99/4A, with most published by Texas Instruments. Some of the games released only for the 99/4A are &quot;Parsec&quot;, &quot;Alpiner&quot;, &quot;Tombstone City: 21st Century&quot;, &quot;Tunnels of Doom&quot;, and &quot;The Attack&quot;. &quot;TI Invaders&quot; and &quot;Car Wars&quot; are TI&#x27;s renditions of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Head On&quot; respectively. &quot;Munch Man&quot; is similar to &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, but the title character fills the maze with a pattern rather than emptying it of dots.

Tigervision offered a solution to the memory limitation of the standard cartridge slot in the form of a 24 KB memory expansion cartridge that attached to the side expansion interface, emulating an expansion device. This allowed the company to implement a larger game completely in machine code, which was used for &quot;Espial&quot; and &quot;Miner 2049er&quot;. Exceltec also released two similar side cartridges: &quot;Arcturus&quot; and &quot;Killer Caterpillar&quot;.

The media criticized the computer&#x27;s game library as mediocre. TI not only discouraged third-party development, including games, but it also failed to license popular arcade games like &quot;Zaxxon&quot; and &quot;Frogger&quot;.

==Unreleased hardware==
===Hex-Bus===
The Hex-Bus interface was designed in 1982 and intended for commercial release in late 1983. It connects the console to peripherals via a high-speed serial link. Though it is similar to today&#x27;s USB (plug and play, hot-swappable, etc.), it was never released, with only a small number of prototypes appearing in collector hands after TI pulled out of the market.

===TI-99/4A successors===
The TI-99/4 was intended to fit in the middle of a planned range of TI-99 computers, with prototypes and documentation created for other models. Initial plans were for a lower-end TI-99/2 and a more powerful TI-99/8. Later ideas for expanding the range included a bargain-priced TI-99/3, a terminal TI-99/7, and a direct follow-up to the TI-99/4A referred to as either TI-99/4B or TI-99/5.

At the time they left the home computer market, TI had been actively developing two successors to the TI-99/4A that went through several prototypes but never entered production. Some of these prototypes are now in the hands of TI-99/4A collectors. Both machines would have been substantially faster than the original TI-99/4A and used the Hex-Bus serial interface.

* TI-99/2, a 4K RAM, 32K ROM computer with no color, sound, or joystick port and a Mylar keyboard. TI designed the computer in four and a half months to sell for under $100 and compete with the Sinclair ZX81 and Timex Sinclair 1000. Based on the TMS9995 CPU running at 10.7 MHz and with a built-in RF modulator, performance greatly increased when the screen was blank. The University of Southwestern Louisiana developed system software. 99/2 software ran on the 99/4A, but not vice versa. Working prototypes appeared at the January 1983 Consumer Electronic Show (CES). By mid-1983 the 99/4A sold for $99, however. The company canceled the 99/2 in April 1983, but planned to exhibit it at the June CES until other companies&#x27; press conferences there indicated that competition would increase.
* TI-99/8 and 99/6. The 99/8 reportedly had a $200 wholesale price. Privately shown to dealers but not announced at June CES, it was formally canceled in October 1983. It included 64 KB of RAM expandable to 15 megabytes, a larger keyboard, built-in speech synthesis, built-in UCSD Pascal operating environment, and the full 16-bit data bus available on the expansion port. It was abandoned in the prototype stage. The Multi Emulator Super System is capable of running what are believed to be the system&#x27;s ROMs.

==Legacy==

The Tomy Tutor and its sibling systems are Japanese computers similar in architecture and firmware to the 99/8. Unlike the 99/8, it was released commercially, but sold poorly outside Japan. Portions of the operating system and BASIC code are similar to the 99/8.

The annual Chicago TI Faire is now in its 42nd year. where people celebrated the TI-99 family of computers.

===Post-TI development===
The Myarc Geneve 9640 is an enhanced TI-99/4A clone built by Myarc as a card to fit into the TI Peripheral Expansion System. It uses an IBM PC/XT detached keyboard. Released in 1987, it is similar to the unreleased TI-99/8 system. It includes a 12 MHz TMS9995 processor, enhanced graphics with 80-column text mode, 16-bit wide RAM, MDOS, and is compatible with nearly all TI software and slot-mounted hardware. A toggle switch slows the computer to the speed of the original.

The Second Generation CPU card (SGCPU) was released by the System 99 User Group in 1996 as a card to be installed in the PEB.

In 2004, a Universal Serial Bus card and Advanced Technology Attachment controller for IDE hard disks for the PEB were released.

A range of plug-in cartridge boards have been developed, allowing software projects to be distributed on cartridge.

The Phoenix G2, was designed in 2010 by Gary Smith, a member of TI-User Group UK. It uses two FPGAs to emulate the entire architecture of the Myarc Geneve 9640 and the TMS9995 microprocessor. It incorporates an SD card reader, Ethernet, VGA output, and 64 MB RAM.

An FPGA-based TMS9918 compatible graphics chip, called the F18A, is a drop-in replacement for the original 9918 VDP, but features VGA output, bypassing the TMS9918A&#x27;s native composite output, and contains other enhancements such as removal of the restriction of 4 sprites per scan line.

<text>Kevin Tyrone Eubanks (born November 15, 1957) is an American jazz and fusion guitarist and composer. He was the leader of The Tonight Show Band with host Jay Leno from 1995 to 2010. He also led the Primetime Band on the short-lived &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Eubanks was born into a musical family. His older brother, Robin Eubanks, is a trombonist, and his younger brothers Duane Eubanks is a trumpeter and Shane Eubanks is a DJ. As an elementary school student, Eubanks was trained in violin, trumpet, and piano at the Settlement Music School (in Philadelphia). He later attended Berklee College of Music (in Boston, Massachusetts).

== Personal life ==
Eubanks is a pescetarian and maintains a diet of fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, egg whites, and fish.

== Career ==
After Eubanks moved to New York, he began performing with noted jazzmen such as Art Blakey (1980–81), Roy Haynes, Slide Hampton and Sam Rivers. Like his brother Robin, Eubanks has played on record with double bassist Dave Holland.

In 1983, while continuing to perform with others, he formed his own quartet, playing gigs in Jordan, Pakistan, and India on a tour sponsored by the U.S. State Department.

In 2020, Eubanks appeared as a guest on the &quot;Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip&quot; marathon fundraiser episode of &quot;The George Lucas Talk Show&quot;. In the fall of 2021, Eubanks returned to working with Leno, as a sidekick on a revival of the TV game show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;.

=== Recording ===
His first recording as a leader, &quot;Guitarist&quot;, was released on the Elektra label when Eubanks was 25 years old. It led to a seven-album contract with the GRP label and four albums for Blue Note. In total, Eubanks has appeared on over 100 albums. In 2001, he founded the label Insoul Music on which he has released six albums.

=== Teaching ===
Eubanks has taught at the Banff School of Fine Arts in Canada, at Rutgers University, and at the Charlie Parker School in Perugia, Italy. In 2005, Eubanks received an honorary doctorate degree from his alma mater, Berklee College of Music. He has served as an active member of the Artistic Advisory Panel of the BMI Foundation since 1999.

===&quot;The Tonight Show&quot;===
In 1992, Eubanks moved to the West Coast to play guitar in The Tonight Show Band. He composed &quot;Kevin&#x27;s Country,&quot; the closing theme music for &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. In 1995, he replaced Branford Marsalis as leader of the band.

When NBC moved Leno&#x27;s show from late night to prime time, Eubanks moved with the band to continue conducting music for the short-lived &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;. Eubanks appeared on the new show as The Primetime Band.

On April 12, 2010, Eubanks announced on the show that he would be leaving &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; following its 18th season. His last show was on Friday, In May 2010. He indicated in an interview with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; that he wanted to concentrate on music, adding that his leaving was not provoked by any problems with Leno or NBC. Following his departure from &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, he began touring with bandmate Marvin &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith on drums, Bill Pierce on saxophone, and Rene Camacho on bass.

<text>A sound editor is a creative professional responsible for selecting and assembling sound recordings in preparation for the final sound mixing or mastering of a television program, motion picture, video game, or any production involving recorded or synthetic sound. The sound editor works with the supervising sound editor. The supervising sound editor often assigns scenes and reels the sound editor based on the editor&#x27;s strengths and area of expertise. Sound editing developed out of the need to fix the incomplete, undramatic, or technically inferior sound recordings of early talkies, and over the decades has become a respected filmmaking craft, with sound editors implementing the aesthetic goals of motion picture sound design.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognizes the artistic contribution of exceptional sound editing with the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing.

There are primarily three divisions of sound that are combined to create a final mix, these being dialogue, effects, and music. In larger markets such as New York and Los Angeles, sound editors often specialize in only one of these areas, thus a show will have separate dialogue, effects, and music editors. In smaller markets, sound editors are expected to know how to handle it all, often crossing over into the mixing realm as well. Editing effects is likened to creating the sonic world from scratch, while dialogue editing is likened to taking the existing sonic world and fixing it. Dialogue editing is more accurately thought of as &quot;production sound editing&quot;, where the editor takes the original sound recorded on the set, and using a variety of techniques, makes the dialogue more understandable, as well as smoother, so the listener doesn&#x27;t hear the transitions from shot to shot (often the background sounds underneath the words change dramatically from take to take). Among the challenges that effects editors face are creatively adding together various elements to create believable sounds for everything you see on screen, as well as memorizing their sound effects library.

==Equipment==

The essential piece of equipment used in modern sound editing is the digital audio workstation, or DAW. A DAW allows sounds, stored as computer files on a host computer, to be placed in timed synchronization with a motion picture, mixed, manipulated, and documented. The standard DAW system in use by the American film industry, as of 2012, is Avid&#x27;s Pro Tools, with the majority running on Macs. Another system in use presently is Yamaha owned Steinberg&#x27;s cross platform DAW Nuendo running on Macs using operating system Mac OS X but also on Windows XP. Other systems historically used for sound editing were:
* WaveFrame AudioFrame, manufactured by WaveFrame of Emeryville, California
* Several DAWs have been manufactured by Fairlight
* SonicSolutions
* AMS-Neve Audiofile
* AudioVision manufactured by Avid

The WaveFrame, Fairlights, and Audiofile were of the &quot;integrated&quot; variety of DAW, and required the purchase of expensive proprietary hardware and specialized computers (not standard PCs or Macs). Of the two surviving systems, Pro Tools still requires some proprietary hardware (either a low cost portable device such as the &quot;Mbox&quot; or the more expensive multichannel A/D,D/A converters for more professional high end applications), while Nuendo (a successor to Cubase) is of the &quot;host based&quot; variety.

==Sound-effects library==
Sound-effects editors typically use an organized catalog of sound recordings from which sound effects can be easily accessed and used in film soundtracks. There are several commercially distributed sound-effects libraries available, the two most well-known publishers being Sound Ideas and The Hollywood Edge. Online search engines, such as Sounddogs, A Sound Effect and Sonniss allow users to purchase sound effects libraries from a large online database.

Many sound effects editors make their own customized sound recordings which are accumulated into highly prized personal sound effects libraries. Often, sound effects used in films will be saved and reused in subsequent films. One exemplary case in point is a recording known as the &quot;Wilhelm Scream&quot; which has become known for its repeated use in many famous films such as &quot;The Charge at Feather River&quot; (1953), Pierre Marette Story (1957), &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992). Credited with naming and popularizing this particular recording is sound designer Ben Burtt.

==History==

===Early talkies===
The first sound process to substantially displace silent films in the moviegoing market was the Vitaphone process. Under the Vitaphone process, a microphone recorded the sound performed on set directly to a phonograph master, which made Vitaphone recordings impossible to cut or resynchronize, as later processes would allow. This limited the Vitaphone process to capturing musical acts or one-take action scenes, like Vaudeville routines or other re-creations of stage performances; essentially, scenes that required no editing at all. However, Warner Brothers, even as early as &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, began experimenting with the mixing of multiple phonograph recordings and intercutting between the &quot;master&quot; sync take and coverage of other angles. The original mixing console used to make the master recording of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, still viewable in the Warner Bros. Studio Museum, has no more than four or five knobs, but each is still visibly labeled with the basic &quot;groups&quot; that a modern sound designer would recognize: &quot;music&quot;, &quot;crowd&quot;, and so on.

Warner Bros. developed increasingly sophisticated technology to sequence greater numbers of phonograph sound effects to picture using the Vitaphone system, but these were rendered obsolete with the widespread adoption of sound-on-film processes in the early 1930s.

===Mechanical editing===
In a sound-on-film process, a microphone captures sound and converts it into a signal that can be photographed on film. Since the recording is imposed linearly on the medium, and the medium is easily cut and glued, sounds recorded can be easily re-sequenced and separated onto separate tracks, allowing more control in mixing. Options expanded further when optical sound recording processes were replaced with magnetic recording in the 1950s. Magnetic recording offered a better signal-to-noise ratio, allowing more tracks to be played simultaneously without increasing noise on the full mix.

The greater number of options available to the editors led to more complex and creative sound tracks, and it was in this period that a set of standard practices became established which continued until the digital era, and many of the notional concepts are still at the core of sound design, computerized or not:

* Sounds are assembled together onto tracks. Many tracks are mixed together (or &quot;dubbed together&quot;) to create a final film.
* A track will generally contain only one &quot;type&quot; or group of sound. A track that contains dialogue only contains dialogue, a track that contains music should only contain music. Many tracks may carry all the sound for one group.
* Tracks may be mixed a group at a time, in a process called predubbing. All of the tracks containing dialogue may be mixed at one time, and all of the tracks containing foley may be mixed at another time. In the process of predubbing, many tracks can be mixed into one.
* Predubs are mixed together to create a final dub. On the occasion of the final dub, final decisions about the balance between different groups of sounds are made.

Historically the Dubbing Mixer (UK) or Re-Recording Mixer (US) was the specialist who mixed all the audio tracks supplied by the Dubbing Editor (with the addition of &#x27;live sounds&#x27; such as Foley) in a special Dubbing Suite. As well as mixing, he would introduce equalization, compression and filtered sound effects, etc. while seated at a large console. Often two or three mixers would sit alongside, each controlling sections of audio, e.g., dialogue, music, effects.

In the era of optical sound tracks, it was difficult to mix more than eight tracks at once without accumulating excessive noise. At the height of magnetic recording, 200 tracks or more could be mixed together, aided by Dolby noise reduction. In the digital era there is no limit. For example, a single predub can exceed a hundred tracks, and the final dub can be the sum of a thousand tracks.

=== Digital sound ===
The mechanical system of sound editing remained unchanged until the early 1990s, when digital audio workstations acquired features sufficient for use in film production, mainly, the ability to synchronize with picture, and the ability to play back many tracks at once with CD-quality fidelity. The quality of 16-bit audio at a 48 kHz sampling rate allowed hundreds of tracks to be mixed together
with negligible noise.

The physical manifestation of the work became computerized: sound recordings, and the decisions the editors made in assembling them, were now digitized, and could be versioned, done, undone, and archived instantly and compactly. In the magnetic recording era, sound editors owned trucks to ship their tracks to a mixing stage, and transfers to magnetic film were measured in hundreds of thousands of feet. Once the materials arrived at the stage, a dozen recordists and mix technicians required a half an hour to load the three or four dozen tracks a predub might require. In the digital era, 250 hours of stereo sound, edited and ready to mix, can be transported on a single 160 GB hard drive. As well, this 250 hours of material can be copied in four hours or less, as opposed to the old system, which, predictably, would take 250 hours.

Because of these innovations, sound editors, as of 2005, face the same issues as other computerized, &quot;knowledge-based&quot; professionals, including the loss of work due to outsourcing to cheaper labor markets, and the loss of royalties due to ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights.

===Animation sound editing===
In the field of animation, traditionally the sound editors have been given the more prestigious title of &quot;film editor&quot; in screen credits. As animated films are more often than not planned to the frame, the traditional functions of a film editor are often unnecessary. Treg Brown is known to cartoon fans as the sound effects genius of Warner Bros. Animation. Other greats of the field have included Jimmy MacDonald of the Walt Disney Studios, Greg Watson and Don Douglas at Hanna-Barbera, and Joe Siracusa of UPA and various TV cartoon studios.

== Other fields ==
In the production of radio programs and music, persons who manipulate sound recordings are known simply as &quot;editors&quot;, in cases where the producers themselves do not perform the task.

<text>To Die For is a 1995 satirical black comedy film directed by Gus Van Sant. It stars Nicole Kidman, Joaquin Phoenix and Matt Dillon, with Illeana Douglas, Wayne Knight, Casey Affleck, Kurtwood Smith, Dan Hedaya, and Alison Folland in supporting roles. The plot follows Suzanne Stone, an ambitious New Hampshire woman with dreams of becoming a celebrity, who will stop at nothing until she achieves fame on TV. The film&#x27;s narrative combines a traditional drama with darkly comic direct-to-camera monologues by Kidman&#x27;s character, and mockumentary interviews, some tragic, with other characters in the film.

&quot;To Die For&quot; was written by Buck Henry based on Joyce Maynard&#x27;s novel of the same name, which in turn was inspired by the story of Pamela Smart, a woman who was convicted in 1991 for being an accomplice in a plot to murder her husband. Henry, Maynard, George Segal, and David Cronenberg appear in cameo roles. The film features original music by Danny Elfman.

The film received praise for its satire of the tabloid media, fame, and the true crime genre. The cast was subject to considerable praise, with Kidman earning the best notices in her career at that point. Kidman was nominated for a BAFTA, and won a Golden Globe Award, a Critics&#x27; Choice Award, and a Best Actress Award at the 1st Empire Awards for her performance.

==Plot==
In the fictional town of Little Hope, New Hampshire, Suzanne Stone is a glamorous and ambitious young woman who has always been obsessed with being on television and aspires to become a world-famous broadcast journalist. She begins a passionate romance with Larry Maretto, an Italian American, of whom her parents disapprove, and the two quickly marry. Despite the differences between their families, the two seemingly settle into married life happily, and Larry promises to support her career ambitions. She uses his family&#x27;s restaurant business to keep herself financially stable and takes a job as an assistant at WWEN, a local cable station, in hopes of climbing the network ladder. Through relentless persistence, she is eventually promoted to doing the station&#x27;s evening weather report.

Suzanne goes to a local high school to recruit subjects for a documentary she is producing called “Teens Speak Out.” She immediately attracts two delinquents, Jimmy Emmett and Russel Hines, and befriends Lydia Mertz, a shy and insecure girl who admires Suzanne’s glamor and worldliness. Larry begins pressuring Suzanne to give up her career in favor of helping out at the restaurant and starting a family. As he becomes more insistent, Suzanne views him as an impediment to her desired future and immediately begins plotting his murder. She seduces Jimmy and convinces him to murder Larry by falsely accusing him of abusing her and promising they will have a future together in California once Larry is dead. She also manipulates Lydia into procuring a gun. One night, while Suzanne delivers the evening weather report, Jimmy and Russell break into the Marettos&#x27; condo, and Jimmy shoots and kills Larry.

Though Larry&#x27;s death is ruled the result of a botched burglary, police stumble across a &quot;Teens Speak Out&quot; clip of Suzanne at their school, which points to her sexual involvement with Jimmy. The teens are arrested and connected to the crime scene. Lydia makes a deal with police to converse with Suzanne while wearing a wire, and Suzanne unwittingly reveals her hand in the murder. However, despite this damning evidence, she argues that the police resorted to entrapment and is released on bail. All the charges against Suzanne are dropped. Basking in the media spotlight, however, Suzanne fabricates a story about Larry being a cocaine addict who was murdered by Jimmy and Russell, his purported dealers. Jimmy and Russell are sentenced to life in prison. Russell gets his sentence reduced while Lydia is released on probation. Meanwhile, Larry&#x27;s father, Joe, realizes Suzanne was behind his son&#x27;s death and uses his mafia connections to have her murdered. A hitman lures Suzanne away from her home by posing as a movie studio executive, kills her, and conceals her body beneath a frozen lake.

Lydia tells her side of the story in a televised interview and gains national attention, becoming a celebrity. Janice, Larry&#x27;s sister who always hated Suzanne, practices her figure skating on the frozen lake where Suzanne&#x27;s corpse lies.

==Production==
===Development and casting===
Joyce Maynard&#x27;s book &quot;To Die For&quot; was published in 1992. Maynard loosely based the novel on the facts that emerged during the trial of Pamela Smart, a school media services coordinator who was imprisoned for seducing a 16-year-old student and convincing him to kill her husband. The trial had gained considerable media attention because it was one of the first in the U.S. to allow TV cameras in the courtroom. The book came to the attention of producer Laura Ziskin, who passed it along to Amy Pascal, then an executive vice-president of Columbia Pictures, and the studio bought the rights.

Ziskin pitched the film to director Gus Van Sant, who himself had been interested in working with screenwriter Buck Henry. Van Sant enlisted cinematographer Eric Alan Edwards and editor Curtiss Clayton, his previous collaborators on &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot;, &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;, and &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;.

The studio envisioned Meg Ryan in the role of Suzanne Stone, but Ryan felt that playing a villainous character would be too edgy for her romantic comedy image at the time. Nicole Kidman, who had been wanting to return to more auteur-driven projects after working in big-budget films like &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; and &quot;Far and Away&quot;, lobbied Van Sant for the role and convinced him she was right for the character. &quot;I knew Gus&#x27; work from seeing &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; at an art cinema in Sydney. Those kind of films were basically my cinematic pull&quot;, she said. Others who expressed interest in the role were Patricia Arquette and Ellen DeGeneres. Ultimately, Ryan turned down the $5 million salary offered and Kidman was cast for $2 million.

For the role of Jimmy Emmett, Johnny Galecki, Edward Furlong, and Giovanni Ribisi were considered. Matt Damon read for the part and though he had impressed Van Sant in his audition, he was also considered too old to play a teen and had too much of an &quot;all-American&quot; look. The role went to Joaquin Phoenix, whom Van Sant had known from working with Phoenix&#x27;s late brother River on &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot;. For the role of Russel Hines, Damon recommended Casey Affleck, the younger brother of his best friend, Ben Affleck. A number of actresses including Sandra Bullock, Janeane Garofalo, Jennifer Tilly, and DeGeneres read for the role of Janice Maretto before Illeana Douglas was cast.

===Filming===
The film was primarily shot in the Port Hope area in Toronto. Principal photography took place from March to June of 1994. High school scenes at &quot;Little Hope High&quot; were filmed at King City Secondary School in King City, Ontario, and some actual students of the school were cast as extras.

The honeymoon scenes with Larry and Suzanne were filmed in the Tampa Bay area of Florida.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The film was screened out of competition at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival. &quot;To Die For&quot; was very well-received by critics, with Nicole Kidman&#x27;s performance being especially praised. The film holds an 89% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews, where the consensus reads &quot;Smart, funny, and thoroughly well-cast, &quot;To Die For&quot; takes a sharp – and sadly prescient – stab at dissecting America&#x27;s obsession with celebrity.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 86 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim.&quot;

In her review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin called the film &quot;an irresistible black comedy and a wicked delight&quot; and added, &quot;[it] takes aim at tabloid ethics and hits a solid bull&#x27;s-eye, with Ms. Kidman&#x27;s teasingly beautiful Suzanne as the most alluring of media-mad monsters. The target is broad, but Gus Van Sant&#x27;s film is too expertly sharp and funny for that to matter; instead, it shows off this director&#x27;s slyness better than any of his work since &quot;Drugstore Cowboy&quot; ... Both Mr. Van Sant and Ms. Kidman have reinvented themselves miraculously for this occasion, which brings out the best in all concerned.&quot; 

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, in a review that awarded the film 3 and ½ out of 4 stars, wrote: &quot;&#x27;To Die For&#x27; is the kind of movie that&#x27;s merciless with its characters, and Kidman is superb at making Suzanne into someone who is not only stupid, vain and egomaniacal (we&#x27;ve seen that before) but also vulnerably human. She represents, on a large scale, feelings we have all had in smaller and sneakier ways.&quot;

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said of Kidman, &quot;[she] brings to the role layers of meaning, intention and impulse. Telling her story in close-up – as she does throughout the film – Kidman lets you see the calculation, the wheels turning, the transparent efforts to charm that succeed in charming all the same ... her beauty and magnetism are electric. Undeniably she belongs on camera, which means it&#x27;s equally undeniable that Suzanne belongs on camera. That in itself is an irony, a commentary, or both.&quot;

The film&#x27;s focus on the three teenagers who are ensnared by Suzanne&#x27;s plot also received praise. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Kenneth Turan wrote that Van Sant adds his &quot;trademark absurdist sensibility to the mix as well as an empathy for inarticulate, inchoate teen-agers that turns out to give this film a good deal of its impact&quot;. Turan concluded: &quot;The most accurate assault against the media age since &#x27;Network,&#x27; &#x27;To Die For&#x27;s killer lines and wicked sensibility are given added poignancy by the off-center, sensitive performance of Joaquin Phoenix, River&#x27;s younger brother, the only person more deluded about Suzanne than she is about herself.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;Folland and Affleck skillfully capture the pang of adolescence among no-hopers.&quot;

Katherine Ramsland of Crime Library discussed the film as an example of a work displaying women with antisocial personalities, with Suzanne in particular described as a &quot;manipulator extraordinaire&quot; who harms people through third parties. The character of Suzanne Stone has been described as suffering from narcissistic personality disorder in the scientific journal &quot;BMC Psychiatry&quot;.

Writing in 2007, Emanuel Levy stated, &quot;mean-spirited satire, told in mock-tabloid style, this film features the best performance of Nicole Kidman to date (better than &quot;The Hours&quot; for which she won an Oscar), as an amoral small-town girl obsessed with becoming a TV star.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $21 million in the United States and Canada and $41 million worldwide.

<text>Fabiola Fernanda María-de-las-Victorias Antonia Adelaida de Mora y Aragón (11 June 1928 – 5 December 2014) was Queen of the Belgians as the wife of King Baudouin from their marriage in 1960 until his death in 1993. The couple had no children, as all five of Fabiola&#x27;s pregnancies resulted in miscarriage, so the Crown passed to her husband&#x27;s younger brother, King Albert II.

==Early life==

Doña Fabiola de Mora y Aragón was born on 11 June 1928 in Madrid, Spain, at the , the main residence of the Marqués de Casa Riera. She was the daughter of Don Gonzalo de Mora y Fernández y Riera y del Olmo, 4th Marqués de Casa Riera, 2nd Count of Mora (1887–1957), and his wife, Doña Blanca de Aragón y Carrillo de Albornoz y Barroeta-Aldamar y Elío (1892–1981), daughter of the 6th Marchioness of Casa Torres and Viscountess of Baiguer. Her godmother was Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain.

Queen Fabiola was the fifth child and had six siblings. One of her siblings was Jaime de Mora y Aragón.

She worked as a nurse in a hospital in Madrid and lived with her mother. Before her marriage, she published an album of 12 fairy tales (&quot;Los doce cuentos maravillosos&quot;), one of which (&quot;The Indian Water Lilies&quot;) would get its own pavilion in the Efteling theme park in 1966.

==Marriage==
On 15 December 1960, Fabiola married Baudouin, who had been King of the Belgians since the abdication of his father, Leopold III, in 1951. At the marriage ceremony in the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, she wore a 1926 Art Deco tiara that had been a gift of the Belgian state to her husband&#x27;s mother, Astrid of Sweden, upon her marriage to Leopold III. Her dress of satin and ermine was designed by the couturier Cristóbal Balenciaga. Fabiola was a hospital nurse at the time of her engagement; &quot;Time&quot; magazine, in its 26 September 1960, issue, called Doña Fabiola the &quot;Cinderella Girl&quot; and described her as &quot;an attractive young woman, though no raving beauty&quot; and &quot;the girl who could not catch a man.&quot; On the occasion of her marriage, Spanish bakers set out to honour Fabiola and created a type of bread, &quot;la fabiola&quot;, which is still made in Palencia.

The explorer Guido Derom named the Queen Fabiola Mountains – a newly discovered range of Antarctic mountains – in her honour in 1961. She also has several varieties of ornamental plants named after her.

The royal couple had no children, as the Queen&#x27;s five pregnancies ended in miscarriage in 1961, 1962, 1963, 1966 and 1968. Fabiola openly spoke about her miscarriages in 2008: &#x27;You know, I myself lost five children. You learn something from that experience. I had problems with all my pregnancies, but you know, in the end I think life is beautiful&#x27;. She and Baudouin I called the miscarriages a chance to be able to love all children. She was deeply involved with the upbringing of Prince Philippe and Princess Astrid.

== Activities ==

After the death of Queen Elisabeth, in November 1965, Queen Fabiola became the honorary president of Queen Elisabeth Music Competition. Queen Fabiola attended the elimination rounds and the finals of each session.

During the 1990s, the Hospital Saint-Pierre in Brussels was important in matters around AIDS. Queen Fabiola visited them in 1993 and embraced a patient. She was one of the first public figures to do this.

In September 1993, she became the president of the King Baudouin Foundation, established in 1976 to mark the twenty fifth anniversary of King Baudouin&#x27;s accession. The foundation&#x27;s purpose is to improving the living conditions of the population.

Queen Fabiola also founded the Social Secretariat of the Queen with the purpose to answering many requests for help. She has supported study programmes aimed at prevention and treatment of dyslexia among children.

She established Queen Fabiola Fund for Mental Health. The foundation&#x27;s purpose is to help people with mental problems. During her entire life, she devoted herself to causes such as young women prostitution, human slavery and people with disabilities. Queen Fabiola received several humanitarian awards in her lifetime and was awarded the Ceres Medal in 2001 by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

Every year, Queen Fabiola attend the Summit on Economic Progress of Rural Women at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. The purpose of the summit is to create a movement of first ladies to respond to the call for help from the deprived women in the third world.

==Queen dowager==
Baudouin died in late July 1993 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Albert II. Fabiola moved out of the Royal Castle of Laeken to the more modest Château of Stuyvenberg and reduced her public appearances so as not to overshadow her sister-in-law, Queen Paola.
Admired for her devout Catholic faith and involvement in social causes particularly those related to mental health, children&#x27;s issues and women&#x27;s issues, Queen Fabiola received the 2001 Ceres Medal, in recognition of her work to promote rural women in developing countries. The medal was given by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). She was also honorary president of the King Baudouin Foundation.

In July 2009, the Belgian press published news of anonymous death threats she received stating she would be shot with a crossbow. She responded to the threats during Belgian National Day celebrations by waving an apple to the crowd in a reference to the William Tell folk tale. Subsequent threats by an individual said to have a similar signature to the July 2009 threat-writer were received again in January 2010.

In January 2013, the Socialist Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo criticised Queen Fabiola for her plans to set up a private foundation (Fons Pereos), which would have been a tax-efficient way to pass wealth to her relatives as well as to charitable causes. It was widely seen by the public as inheritance tax evasion (although, since the construction was admitted by Di Rupo to be legal, it would more precisely be a case of tax avoidance). Queen Fabiola denied the charges in a rare public statement: &quot;I have never had the intention of depositing funds I received from the public purse with my foundation. All the monies that I receive from the civil list go on expenditure on my household. The lion&#x27;s share goes on salaries.&quot;

==Linguistic skills==
According to official sources, Queen Fabiola was fluent in French, Dutch, English, German and Italian, in addition to her native Spanish.

==Illness and death==
Queen Fabiola was hospitalised for 15 days with pneumonia beginning 16 January 2009, with her condition described as &quot;serious&quot;. She subsequently recovered and began attending public functions the following May. Queen Fabiola had been in poor health for years, having osteoporosis, as well as having never fully recovered from a lung inflammation she had in 2009. On the evening of 5 December 2014, the Royal Palace announced that Queen Fabiola had died at the Château of Stuyvenberg.

===Funeral===

The federal government declared a period of national mourning from Saturday 6 December to Friday 12 December, the day when the funeral of Queen Fabiola took place at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula in Brussels.

The Royal Family, members of the government and the Lord Speaker received the coffin at the Royal Palace on 10 December where it was placed in the grand antechamber, where it was decorated with flowers and attended by an honour guard of generals, members of the King&#x27;s Royal Military household. Godfried Cardinal Danneels, Metropolitan Archbishop-emeritus of Mechelen-Brussels, celebrated the Requiem Mass.

Members of several royal families around the world including the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, Empress of Japan, Queen of Denmark, King and Queen of Sweden, King of Norway accompanied by his sister Princess Astrid, former King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain, former Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, the Sovereign Prince of Liechtenstein, former Empress Farah of Iran and Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn of Thailand, attended the funeral. No members of the British Royal Family or the Monégasque Princely Family attended the funeral, leading to criticism by both Belgian and international press.

<text>Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, a women&#x27;s prison in the town of Bedford, New York, is the only maximum security New York State women&#x27;s prison. The prison previously opened under the name Westfield State Farm in 1901. It lies just outside the hamlet and census-designated place Bedford Hills, New York.

== Facility ==
Bedford Hills Correctional Facility (formerly Bedford Hills Correctional Institution) is one of three New York facilities exclusively for women, the others being Albion Correctional Facility, and Taconic Correctional Facility. Taconic, a medium/minimum-security prison, lies directly across the street from Bedford Hills, while Albion is located in western New York between Rochester and Buffalo. 

The site has been known as the New York State Reformatory for Women at Bedford Hills, and later as Westfield State Farm. Under the name Westfield State Farm, it housed 487 women in 1930, and 645 in 1940.
A prison nursery was first established upon the opening of the prison, in 1901. The current incarnation, Bedford Hills&#x27; family-centered program, was founded by Sister Elaine Roulet. It has served as a model for other prison programs in the United States and is considered the standard for innovative family-centered programs. Mothers incarcerated there are separate from the general population, in the Infant Development Center located on a single floor of one of the buildings. Those who wish to participate in the program must not have had any involvement with child welfare authorities in the past, nor can anyone who has been convicted of a violent crime. Children are allowed to stay in the nursery until 12 months (one year), although this can be extended up to 18 months ( years) so the mother can be released with her child. it is the longest operating prison nursery in the U.S.

In the post–&quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot; period, from the time New York reinstated the death penalty in 1995 until its repeal in 2007, Bedford Hills prison was designated as having the state death row for women. However, New York State did not execute anyone during that time, nor since 1963.

== Political unrest and due process ==
In 1974, in what came to be called the August Rebellion, the prisoners briefly took over parts of the prison in reaction to guards&#x27; assault on Carol Crooks, an incarcerated woman organizing for prisoners&#x27; rights. About 200 of the 450-plus incarcerated women rebelled in protest of the inhumane treatment of Crooks at Bedford Hills. The order directing such compliance had been in effect since 1975.

The prisoners won a subsequent civil-action lawsuit, initiated by Elizabeth Powell, that led to greater protections of Fourth Amendment (due process) rights for incarcerated people, in &quot;Powell v. Ward&quot; (1976).

Following the 1974 rebellion, the prison administration failed to give legal due process in prison disciplinary hearings. Incarcerated women who had been held in solitary confinement brought a lawsuit for violation of due process. They won a $127,000 fund from an out-of-court settlement reached in 1981 after a federal District Court &quot;held state authorities in contempt for failing to provide due process for inmates involved in disciplinary hearings.&quot;

A prisoners&#x27; committee chose to spend the fund for improving prison life; the top priority was a $10,000 lobbying fund to be used to press for merit time legislation to allow time off for good behavior. The committee&#x27;s purchases also included word processors and a copier; recreational equipment such as roller skates; and legal services, including paying for lobbying to have merit time eligibility expanded under state law. An uprising in the prison in November, 1981, that resulted in disciplinary reports against 61 inmates. The reports &quot;were exactly the opposite of the court&#x27;s ruling,&quot; Mr. Coughlin observed, adding, &quot;You can&#x27;t throw away due process by whim.&quot; The administrative staff was all demoted or transferred, and the disciplinary charges against the inmates were dropped. Thomas A. Coughlin, State Corrections Commissioner, stated in 1982 that the troubles at Bedford were &quot;the fault of the previous local administration.&quot;

==Notable people incarcerated at Bedford Hills==

*Kathy Boudin, a Weather Underground leftist convicted in 1984 for her involvement in the 1981 Brinks robbery that resulted in the killing of three people. She was sentenced to life in prison, became a public health expert while in prison, and was released on September 17, 2003, after serving 22 years. After her parole she accepted a job in the HIV/AIDS Clinic at St. Luke&#x27;s-Roosevelt Hospital Center and as adjunct professor at Columbia University.
*Stacey Castor, wife who was charged in 2007 with second degree murder, second degree attempted murder, and offering a false instrument in the first degree. She was found guilty of intentionally poisoning then-husband David Castor with antifreeze in 2005 and attempting to murder her daughter Ashley Wallace. In addition, she was suspected of having murdered her first husband, Michael Wallace, whose grave lay next to David Castor&#x27;s. After an autopsy performed on Michael Wallace&#x27;s body found traces of antifreeze and rat poison in his remains, the medical examiner ruled the death a poisoning homicide. Castor was found dead in her cell on June 11, 2016, as a result of a heart attack.
*Judith Alice Clark, convicted in 1983 for her involvement in the same 1981 Brinks robbery as Kathy Boudin. She was not represented by counsel at trial and was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences at Bedford Hills. She was granted parole on April 17, 2019, after spending 38 years in prison. She co-founded the AIDS Counseling and Education (ACE) program at Bedford Hills, which has been emulated in prisons nationwide, and was instrumental in establishing a college program at Bedford Hills that has helped more than 100 prisoners earn college degrees.
*Carol Crooks, organizer for reform of prison conditions and due process for incarcerated people
*Amy Fisher, famously nicknamed &quot;The Long Island Lolita&quot; by the press, she was convicted of the 1992 shooting of the wife of her lover Joey Buttafuoco, with whom she began an affair as a 16-year-old student. She served seven years in prison and was released in 1999.
*Jean Harris murdered her ex-lover, Dr. Herman Tarnower, who was a cardiologist and author of the best-selling book &quot;The Scarsdale Diet&quot;. Eleven years after Harris&#x27;s conviction, Governor Mario Cuomo commuted the remainder of her sentence on December 29, 1992, as she was being prepped for quadruple bypass heart surgery. She was released from prison by the parole board after serving 11 years and later moved to the Whitney Center, a retirement home in Hamden, Connecticut.

*Nixzaliz Santiago, convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of her daughter, Nixzmary Brown, and sentenced to 43 years in prison. Nixzmary&#x27;s stepfather Cesar Rodriguez tortured Nixzmary (by binding her, duct-taping her mouth, and beat her), and her mother allegedly ignored this and didn&#x27;t contact authorities in time to save her daughter&#x27;s life.
*Pamela Smart, a former media services consultant found guilty in March 1991 for conspiring with her underage lover, William Flynn, and his three associates to kill her 24-year-old husband, Greggory Smart, in Derry, New Hampshire. She was transferred to Bedford Hills from the New Hampshire State Prison for Women in March 1993, because New Hampshire lacked a secure enough facility to house her.

<doc id="284629" wikidata="Q14348" url="?curid=284629" title="Welland Canal">
<text>The Welland Canal is a ship canal in Ontario, Canada, and part of the St. Lawrence Seaway and Great Lakes Waterway. The canal traverses the Niagara Peninsula between Port Weller on Lake Ontario, and Port Colborne on Lake Erie, and was erected because the Niagara River—the only natural waterway connecting the lakes—was unnavigable due to Niagara Falls. The Welland Canal enables ships to ascend and descend the Niagara Escarpment, and has followed four different routes since it opened.

The Welland Canal passes about 3,000 ships which transport about of cargo a year. It was a major factor in the growth of the city of Toronto, Ontario. The original canal and its successors allowed goods from Great Lakes ports such as Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Chicago, as well as other heavily industrialized areas of the United States and Ontario, to be shipped to the Port of Montreal or to Quebec City, where they were usually reloaded onto ocean-going vessels for international shipping.

Since its initial opening on November 30, 1829, the canal has been reconstructed numerous times to accommodate larger vessels and provide for quicker navigation. The First Welland Canal was excavated between 1824 and 1829, and operated until 1845. The Second Welland Canal, built between 1841 and 1845, had locks made of stone rather than wood, and had greater width and depth that the First Canal; it remained in operation for nearly a century before closing permanently in 1935. The Third Welland Canal, built between 1872 and 1877, was deeper and wider still and cut a straighter path through the escarpment, and featured 26 masonry locks lined with wood to protect ships rubbing against the sides or bottom; it too operated until 1935. The Fourth Welland Canal began construction in 1913 and, after a delay due to World War I, was eventually completed in 1932; deeper and wider than the Third Canal, its opening permitted two large ships to pass going in opposite directions, and it featured only eight locks, as compared with the 40 locks of the First Canal. It remains in operation to this day.

The Welland Canal eclipsed other, narrower canals in the region, such as the Trent-Severn Waterway and, significantly, the Erie Canal (which linked the Atlantic and Lake Erie via New York City and Buffalo, New York) by providing a shorter, more direct connection from Port Colbourne on Lake Erie to Port Weller on Lake Ontario.

The southern, Lake Erie terminus of the canal is higher than the northern terminus on Lake Ontario. The canal includes eight ship locks. Seven of the locks (Locks 1–7, the &#x27;Lift&#x27; locks) are long and raise (or lower) passing ships by between each. The southernmost lock, (Lock 8 – the &#x27;Guard&#x27; or &#x27;Control&#x27; lock) is in length. The Garden City Skyway passes over the canal, restricting the maximum height of the masts of the ships allowed on this canal to .

All other highway or railroad crossings of the Welland Canal are either movable bridges (of the vertical lift or bascule bridge types) or tunnels. The maximum permissible length of a ship in this canal is . It takes ships an average of about eleven hours to traverse the entire length of the Welland Canal.

==History==

Before the digging of the Welland Canal, shipping traffic between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie used a portage road between Chippawa, Ontario, and Queenston, Ontario, which are both located on the Niagara River—above and below Niagara Falls, respectively.

===First Welland Canal===
The Welland Canal Company was incorporated by the Province of Upper Canada, in 1824, after a petition by nine &quot;freeholders of the District of Niagara&quot;. One of the petitioners was William Hamilton Merritt, who was in part looking to provide a regular flow of water for his many water-powered industries along the Twelve Mile Creek in Thorold. The construction began at Allanburg, Ontario, on November 30, at a point now marked as such on the west end of Bridge No. 11 (formerly Highway 20). This canal opened for a trial run on November 30, 1829. After a short ceremony at Lock One, in Port Dalhousie, the schooner &quot;Anne &amp; Jane&quot; (also called &quot;Annie &amp; Jane&quot; in some texts) made the first transit, upbound to Buffalo, New York, with Merritt as a passenger on her deck.

The first canal ran from Port Dalhousie, Ontario, on Lake Ontario south along Twelve Mile Creek to St. Catharines. From there it took a winding route up the Niagara Escarpment through Merritton, Ontario, to Thorold, where it continued south via Allanburg to Port Robinson, Ontario, on the Welland River. Ships went east (downstream) on the Welland River to Chippawa, at the south (upper) end of the old portage road, where they made a sharp right turn into the Niagara River, upstream towards Lake Erie. Originally, the section between Allanburg and Port Robinson was planned to be carried in a tunnel. However, the sandy soil in this part of Ontario made a tunnel infeasible, and a deep open-cut canal was dug instead.

A southern extension from Port Robinson opened in 1833, with the founding of Port Colborne. This extension followed the Welland River south to Welland (known then as the settlement of Aqueduct, for the wooden aqueduct that carried the canal over the Welland River at that point), and then split to run south to Port Colborne on Lake Erie. A feeder canal ran southwest from Welland to another point on Lake Erie, just west of Rock Point Provincial Park in Port Maitland. With the opening of the extension, the canal stretched between the two lakes, with 40 wooden locks. The minimum lock size was , with a minimum canal depth of .

Deterioration of the wood used in the 40 locks and the increasing size of ships led to demand for the Second Welland Canal, which used cut stone locks, within just a few years.

===Second Welland Canal===
In 1839 the government of Upper Canada approved the purchase of shares in the private canal company in response to the company&#x27;s continuing financial problems in the face of the continental financial panic of 1837. The public buyout was completed in 1841, and work began to deepen the canal and to reduce the number of locks to 27, each . By 1846, a deep path was completed through the Welland Canal, and by 1848 that depth was extended the rest of the way to the Atlantic Ocean via the future path of the St. Lawrence Seaway.

Competition came in 1854 with the opening of the Erie and Ontario Railway, running parallel to the original portage road. In 1859, the Welland Railway opened, parallel to the canal and with the same endpoints. But this railway was affiliated with the canal, and was actually used to help transfer cargoes from the lake ships, which were too large for the small canal locks, to the other end of the canal (The Trillium Railway owns the railway&#x27;s remnants and Port Colborne Harbour Railway). Smaller ships called &quot;canallers&quot; also took a part of these loads. Due to this problem, it was soon apparent the canal would have to be enlarged again. On April 20, 1882 the canal was re-opened, increasing the depth to twelve feet throughout. The increased depth allowed for ships carrying up to 24,000 bushels of grain to navigate the canal whereas they previously they had only been able to carry about 18,000 bushels. The first trip from Oswego carried 700 tons of coal, compared to 500 tons which was possible before the increased depth.

===Third Welland Canal===

In 1887, a new shorter alignment was completed between St. Catharines and Port Dalhousie. One of the most interesting features of this third Welland Canal was the Merritton Tunnel, built in 1876 on the Grand Trunk Railway line that ran under the canal between Locks 18 and 19. Another nearby tunnel carried the canal over a sunken section of the St David&#x27;s Road. The new route had a minimum depth of with 26 stone locks, each long by wide. Even so, the canal was still too small for many boats.
===Fourth (current) Welland Canal===
Construction on the current canal began in 1913, but work was put on hold from 1916 to 1919 due to a shortage of men and workers during World War I (1914–18) and was completed and officially opened on August 6, 1932. Dredging to the planned 25 foot depth was not completed until 1935. The route was again changed north of St. Catharines, now running directly north to Port Weller. In this configuration, there are eight locks, seven at the Niagara Escarpment and the eighth, a guard lock, at Port Colborne to adjust with the varying water depth in Lake Erie. The depth was now , with locks long by wide. This canal is officially known now as the Welland Ship Canal. The Welland Canal&#x27;s first &quot;hands-free&quot; vacuum mooring was tested in Lock 7 prior to 2014. The installation of the updated systems for Locks 1 through 7 was originally set to be completed in 2017, but the project was not finished until early 2018 after unforeseen delays.

====Welland By-Pass====
In the 1950s, with the building of the present St. Lawrence Seaway, a standard depth of was adopted. The long Welland By-Pass, built between 1967 and 1972, opened for the 1973 shipping season, providing a new and shorter alignment between Port Robinson and Port Colborne and by-passing downtown Welland. All three crossings of the new alignment—one an aqueduct for the Welland River—were built as tunnels. Around the same time, the Thorold Tunnel was built at Thorold and several bridges were removed.

===Proposed Fifth Welland Canal===
These projects were to be tied into a proposed new canal, titled the Fifth Welland Canal, which was planned to by-pass most of the existing canal to the east and to cross the Niagara Escarpment in four twinned Panamax locks. While land for the project was expropriated and early designs initiated, the project never got past early planning or construction stages and has since been shelved.

The present Welland Ship Canal was originally designed to last until 2030, almost 100 years after it first opened, and 200 years since the first full shipping season of the original canal in 1830. Subsequent improvements to the canal infrastructure mean that it may last much longer before it needs to be replaced.

==Accidents==
On June 20, 1912, the government survey steamer &quot;La Canadienne&quot; lost control due to mechanical problems in the engine room and smashed into the upstream gates of Lock No. 22 of the 3rd Welland Canal, forcing them open by six inches. The resulting surge of water flooded downstream, cresting the upstream gates of Lock No. 21 where five boys were fishing. One boy ran to safety and one of the boys was saved by a government surveyor. But the remaining three were knocked into the water, drowning in the surge.

On August 25, 1974, the northbound ore-carrier &quot;Steelton&quot; struck Bridge 12 in Port Robinson. The bridge was rising and the impact knocked the bridge over, destroying it. No one was killed. The bridge master, Albert Beaver, and a watchman on the ship suffered minor injuries. The bridge has not been replaced and the inhabitants of Port Robinson have been served by a ferry for many years.

On August 11, 2001, the lake freighter &quot;Windoc&quot; collided with Bridge 11 in Allanburg, closing vessel traffic on the Welland Canal for two days. The accident destroyed the ship&#x27;s wheelhouse and funnel (chimney), ignited a large fire on board, and caused minor damage to the vertical-lift bridge. The accident and portions of its aftermath were captured on amateur video. The vessel was a total loss, but there were no reported injuries, and no pollution to the waterway. The damage to the bridge was focused on the centre of the vertical-lift span. It was repaired over a number of weeks and reopened to vehicular traffic on November 16, 2001. The Marine Investigation Report concluded, &quot;it is likely that the [vertical-lift bridge] operator&#x27;s performance was impaired while the bridge span was lowered onto the Windoc.&quot;

At around noon on Wednesday September 30, 2015, the Lena J cargo ship collided with Bridge 19 in Port Colborne, closing the bridge to all vehicle and pedestrian traffic until an assessment could be made on the condition of the bridge. The vessel had sustained damage to its bridge, but was still able to continue on its voyage to Burns Harbour, Indiana. Pictures of the damage sustained to the vessel and Bridge 19 were captured. On Friday October 1, 2015, Chris Lee, an acting direct engineer for the City of Port Colborne, said that the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation (SLSMC) will likely close the bridge to all vehicle traffic until the end of the year. However, pedestrians will be able to cross the bridge, and emergency services will be able to cross the bridge on a limited basis. On Tuesday October 6, 2015, the City of Port Colborne released a media statement, which stated that Bridge 19, &quot;will remain closed to vehicular traffic until after the close of the shipping season in December. Repairs will begin in early January.&quot; Detour routes have been planned and mapped by the City of Port Colborne and the City of Welland in order to ease the flow of traffic over Bridge 19A.

The Welland Canal Fallen Workers Memorial at Lock 3 was unveiled on November 12, 2017. This commemorates the 137 workers who died while building the canal.

On July 11, 2020 two cargo ships, the &quot;Alanis&quot; and the &quot;Florence Spirit&quot;, struck each other while executing a passing manoeuvre near Port Robinson. According to the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation, no one was injured, no cargo was spilled, and an investigation would be undertaken. The final investigation report was released in August 2022.

==Sabotage==
The Welland Canal has been the focus of plots on a number of occasions throughout its existence. However, only two have ever been carried out. The earliest and potentially most devastating attack occurred on September 9, 1841, at Lock No. 37 (Allanburg) of the First Welland Canal () (approximately 180 m north of today&#x27;s Allanburg bridge), when an explosive charge destroyed one of the lock gates. However, a catastrophic flood was prevented when a guard gate located upstream of the lock closed into place preventing the upstream waters from careening down the route of the Canal and causing further damage and possible injury or loss of life. It was suspected that Benjamin Lett was responsible for the explosion.

On April 21, 1900, about 6:30 in the evening, a dynamite charge was set off against the hinges of Lock No. 24 of the Third Welland Canal (just to the east of Lock No. 7 of today&#x27;s canal ()), doing minor damage. This time, the saboteurs were caught in nearby Thorold. John Walsh, John Nolan and the ringleader &quot;Dynamite&quot; Luke Dillon (a member of Clan-na-Gael) were tried at the Welland Courthouse and found guilty, receiving life sentences at Kingston Penitentiary. The &quot;star witness&quot; at the trial was a 16-year-old Thorold girl named Euphemia Constable, who caught a good look at the bombers before being knocked unconscious by the blast. While waiting to testify, the girl received death threats, but, they turned out to be a hoax. As for the prisoners, Nolan lost his sanity while incarcerated, John Walsh was eventually released while Luke Dillon remained in custody until July 12, 1914.

The First World War brought with it plots against the canal and the most notable of them came to be known as &quot;The Von Papen Plot&quot;. In April 1916, a United States federal grand jury issued an indictment against Franz von Papen, Captain Hans Tauscher, Captain Karl Boy-Ed, Constantine Covani and Franz von Rintelen on charges of a plot to blow up the Welland Canal. However, Papen was at the time safely on German soil, having been expelled from the US (where he had been serving as a German military attaché) several months previously for alleged earlier acts of espionage and attempted sabotage.

Von Papen remained under indictment on these charges until he became Chancellor of Germany in 1932, at which time the charges were dropped.

==Shipping season==
The canal regularly opens late March through December, with closure in the winter due to hazardous weather. On March 20, 2007, the record for the earliest season opening was broken, and matched the following year.

<text>Matamata () is a town in Waikato, New Zealand. It is located near the base of the Kaimai Ranges, and is a thriving farming area known for Thoroughbred horse breeding and training pursuits. It is part of the Matamata-Piako District, which takes in the surrounding rural areas, as well as Morrinsville and Te Aroha. State Highway 27 and the Kinleith Branch railway run through the town. The town has a population of as of 

A nearby farm was the location for the Hobbiton Movie Set in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The New Zealand government decided to leave the Hobbit holes built on location as tourist attractions. During the period between the filming of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot; they had no furniture or props, but could be entered with vistas of the farm viewed from inside them. A &quot;Welcome to Hobbiton&quot; sign has been placed on the main road. In 2011, parts of Hobbiton began to close in preparation for the three new movies based on the first Tolkien novel, &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

==Demographics==
In 1876 Matamata had 7 homesteads housing 40 European settlers. In 1901 the Matamata Road Board had 300 residents, 50 dwellings, 60 rate payers and 80 rateable properties.

Matamata covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Matamata&quot; was originally applied to a settlement near the Anglican mission at Waharoa. The name &quot;Matamata&quot; was used for Josiah Firth&#x27;s estate and as a town developed near the estate it took the name.
==History==
The first European thought to have visited the Matamata area was the trader Phillip Tapsell in about 1830. In 1833 the Reverend Alfred Nesbit Brown visited the area and in 1835 opened a mission near Matamata Pa, but this closed the following year when intertribal warfare broke out. In 1865 Josiah Firth negotiated with Ngāti Hauā leader Wiremu Tamihana and leased a large area of land, including the future site of the town which he named after the pā. Firth constructed a dray road to Cambridge and cleared the Waihou River so that it was navigable by his (small) boats.

Firth&#x27;s estate later failed and by 1904 had been wholly obtained by the Crown and was subdivided into dairy farm units to take advantage of the new technology of refrigeration. It became a dependent Town District in 1917, an independent Town District in 1919 and was constituted a borough in 1935. With the re-organisation of territorial authorities in New Zealand in 1989, Matamata became part of the Matamata-Piako District.

=== Railway station ===

Matamata was a station on the Kinleith Branch, from Monday 8 March 1886. It was built by Mr D Fallon for the Thames Valley &amp; Rotorua Railway Co. New Zealand Railways Department took over the line on 1 April 1886. Initially 40 minutes north of the temporary terminus at Oxford (Tirau) and about an hour from Morrinsville. For a while Matamata seems to have become a flag station, though it did have cattle yards and a by a goods shed. By 1886 it also had a coal shed able to hold 50 tons, a stationmaster&#x27;s house, 2 cottages, urinals and a brick water tank supplied by a diameter windpump from a well, which was deepened that year. By 1896 Matamata had gained a 4th class station, platform, cart approach and a passing loop for 32 wagons. A telephone came in 1912 and a verandah in 1914. Authority to shift the verandah at Avondale station to Matamata when new station is built, and re-erect, amount £35. House for stationmaster. Platform extended to 175 feet. To extend it to 300 feet will cost £90. Authority for £60 for platform extension. 1919 extension of the verandah have been authorised. In 1919 part of the old Drury station building was erected as a luggage room at Matamata. Improvements are to be put in hand, estimated cost £6,000. Lighting of station and houses. 1927 Additional seating accommodation on platform. 1953 Approval for bicycle shed, estimated cost £90. There was a Post Office at the station until 1911. It had two members of staff from 1913. Matamata was included in the annual returns of railway traffic. For example, in 1924 it sold 26,367 tickets and exported 26,084 sheep and pigs. In 1950 8,868 tickets were sold and it transported 42,322 sheep and pigs. A petrol engined shunter was used in the station yard from 1936. Several Drewry 0-4-0 shunters were introduced in 1936.

The station building was replaced on Monday 17 May 1965 by a new £23,500 steel portal frame and block-work building, with a new platform and approach road from Hetana Street, built by Way &amp; Works Branch staff. The old station was sold for removal by July 1967.

Matamata closed to passengers on 12 November 1968, but reopened to serve the Geyserland Express from 9 December 1991 until 7 October 2001.

Since closure the station has been the &quot;Railside by the Green&quot; community centre since 2002, though it is fenced off from the platform. Occasional excursions still use the platform.

<doc id="284650" wikidata="Q1111386" url="?curid=284650" title="Robert Moses">
<text>Robert Moses (December 18, 1888 – July 29, 1981) was an American urban planner and public official who worked in the New York metropolitan area during the early to mid-20th century. Moses is regarded as one of the most powerful and influential people in the history of New York City and New York state. The grand scale of his infrastructure projects and his philosophy of urban development influenced a generation of engineers, architects, and urban planners across the United States.

Never elected to any office, Moses held various positions throughout his more-than-40-year career. He held as many as 12 titles at once, including New York City Parks Commissioner and chairman of the Long Island State Park Commission. By working closely with New York governor Al Smith early in his career, he became an expert in writing laws and navigating and manipulating the workings of state government. He created and led numerous semi-autonomous public authorities, through which he controlled millions of dollars in revenue and directly issued bonds to fund new ventures with little outside input or oversight.

Moses&#x27;s projects transformed the New York area and revolutionized the way cities in the U.S. were designed and built. As Long Island State Park Commissioner, Moses oversaw the construction of Jones Beach State Park, the most-visited public beach in the United States, and was the primary architect of the New York State Parkway System. As head of the Triborough Bridge Authority, Moses had near-complete control over bridges and tunnels in New York City as well as the tolls collected from them; he built, among others, the Triborough Bridge, the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, and the Throgs Neck Bridge, as well as several major highways. These roadways and bridges, alongside urban renewal efforts that destroyed huge swaths of tenement housing and replaced them with large public housing projects, transformed the physical fabric of New York and inspired other cities to undertake similar development endeavors.

Moses&#x27;s reputation declined after the publication of Robert Caro&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography &quot;The Power Broker&quot; (1974), which cast doubt on the purported benefits of many of Moses&#x27;s projects and further cast Moses as racist. In large part because of &quot;The Power Broker&quot;, Moses is today considered a controversial figure in the history of New York City as well as New York State.

==Early life and education==
Moses was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on December 18, 1888, to parents of German Jewish descent, Isabella “Bella” (Cohen) and Emanuel Moses. He spent the first nine years of his life living at 83 Dwight Street in New Haven, two blocks from Yale University. In 1897, the Moses family moved to New York City, where they lived on East 46th Street off Fifth Avenue. Moses&#x27;s father was a successful department store owner and real estate speculator in New Haven. In order for the family to move to New York City, he sold his real estate holdings and store, then retired. Moses&#x27;s mother was active in the settlement movement, with her own love of building. Robert Moses and his brother Paul attended several schools for their elementary and secondary education, the Dwight School and the Mohegan Lake School, a military academy near Peekskill.

After graduating from Yale College (B.A., 1909) and Wadham College, Oxford (B.A., Jurisprudence, 1911; M.A., 1913), and earning a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University in 1914, Moses became attracted to New York City reform politics.

==Career==

At the start a committed idealist, Moses developed several plans to rid New York of patronage hiring practices, including authoring a 1919 proposal to reorganize the New York state government, which was ultimately not adopted but drew the attention of Belle Moskowitz, a friend and trusted advisor to Governor Al Smith. When the state Secretary of State&#x27;s position became appointive rather than elective, Smith named Moses. He served from 1927 to 1929.

Moses rose to power with Smith, who was elected as governor in 1918, and then again in 1922. With Smith&#x27;s support, Moses set in motion a sweeping consolidation of the New York State government. During that period Moses began his first foray into large-scale public work initiatives, while drawing on Smith&#x27;s political power to enact legislation. This helped create the new Long Island State Park Commission and the State Council of Parks. In 1924, Governor Smith appointed Moses chairman of the State Council of Parks and president of the Long Island State Park Commission. This centralization allowed Smith to run a government later used as a model for Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal federal government. Moses also received numerous commissions that he carried out efficiently, such as the development of Jones Beach State Park. Displaying a strong command of law as well as matters of engineering, Moses became known for his skill in drafting legislation, and was called &quot;the best bill drafter in Albany&quot;. At a time when the public was accustomed to Tammany Hall corruption and incompetence, Moses was seen as a savior of government.

Shortly after President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s inauguration in 1933, the federal government found itself with millions of New Deal dollars to spend, yet states and cities had few projects ready. Moses was one of the few local officials who had projects shovel ready. For that reason, New York City was able to obtain significant Works Progress Administration (WPA), Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), and other Depression-era funding. One of his most influential and longest-lasting positions was that of Parks Commissioner of New York City, a role he served from January 18, 1934, to May 23, 1960.

===Offices held===
The many offices and professional titles that Moses held gave him unusually broad power to shape urban development in the New York metropolitan region. These include, according to the New York Preservation Archive Project:
*Long Island State Park Commission (President, 1924–1963)
* New York State Council of Parks (Chairman, 1924–1963)
*New York Secretary of State (1927–1929)
* Bethpage State Park Authority (President, 1933–1963)
* Emergency Public Works Commission (Chairman, 1933–1934)
* Jones Beach Parkway Authority (President, 1933–1963)
*New York City Department of Parks (Commissioner, 1934–1960)
* Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (Chairman, 1934–1968)
* New York City Planning Commission (Commissioner, 1942–1960)
* New York State Power Authority (Chairman, 1954–1962)
* New York&#x27;s World Fair (President, 1960–1966)
* Office of the Governor of New York (Special Advisor on Housing, 1974–1975)

==Influence==
During the 1920s, Moses sparred with Franklin D. Roosevelt, then head of the Taconic State Park Commission, who favored the prompt construction of a parkway through the Hudson Valley. Moses succeeded in diverting funds to his Long Island parkway projects (the Northern State Parkway, the Southern State Parkway and the Wantagh State Parkway), although the Taconic State Parkway was later completed as well. Moses helped build Long Island&#x27;s Meadowbrook State Parkway. It was the first fully divided limited access highway in the world.

Moses was a highly influential figure in the initiation of many of the reforms that restructured New York state&#x27;s government during the 1920s. A &#x27;Reconstruction Commission&#x27; headed by Moses produced a highly influential report that provided recommendations that would largely be adopted, including the consolidation of 187 existing agencies under 18 departments, a new executive budget system, and the four-year term limit for the governorship.

=== WPA swimming pools ===
During the Depression, Moses, along with Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, was especially interested in creating new pools and other bathing facilities, such as those in Jacob Riis Park, Jones Beach, and Orchard Beach. He devised a list of 23 pools around the city. The pools would be built using funds from the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal agency created as part of the New Deal to combat the Depression&#x27;s negative effects.

Eleven of these pools were to be designed concurrently and open in 1936. These comprised ten pools at Astoria Park, Betsy Head Park, Crotona Park, Hamilton Fish Park, Highbridge Park, Thomas Jefferson Park, McCarren Park, Red Hook Park, Jackie Robinson Park, and Sunset Park, as well as a standalone facility at Tompkinsville Pool. Moses, along with architects Aymar Embury II and Gilmore David Clarke, created a common design for these proposed aquatic centers. Each location was to have distinct pools for diving, swimming, and wading; bleachers and viewing areas; and bathhouses with locker rooms that could be used as gymnasiums. The pools were to have several common features, such as a minimum length, underwater lighting, heating, filtration, and low-cost construction materials. To fit the requirement for cheap materials, each building would be built using elements of the Streamline Moderne and Classical architectural styles. The buildings would also be near &quot;comfort stations&quot;, additional playgrounds, and spruced-up landscapes.

Construction for some of the 11 pools began in October 1934. By mid-1936, ten of the eleven WPA-funded pools were completed and were being opened at a rate of one per week. Combined, the facilities could accommodate 66,000 swimmers. The eleven WPA pools were considered for New York City landmark status in 1990. Ten of the pools were designated as New York City landmarks in 2007 and 2008.

Moses allegedly fought to keep African American swimmers out of his pools and beaches. One subordinate remembers Moses saying the pools should be kept a few degrees colder, allegedly because Moses believed African Americans did not like cold water.

===Water crossings===

====Triborough Bridge====

Although Moses had power over the construction of all New York City Housing Authority public housing projects and headed many other entities, it was his chairmanship of the Triborough Bridge Authority that gave him the most power.

The Triborough Bridge (later officially renamed the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge) opened in 1936, connecting the Bronx, Manhattan, and Queens via three separate spans. Language in its Authority&#x27;s bond contracts and multi-year Commissioner appointments made it largely impervious to pressure from mayors and governors. While New York City and New York State were perpetually strapped for money, the bridge&#x27;s toll revenues amounted to tens of millions of dollars a year. The Authority was thus able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars by selling bonds, a method also used by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to fund large public construction projects. Toll revenues rose quickly as traffic on the bridges exceeded all projections. Rather than pay off the bonds, Moses used the revenue to build other toll projects, a cycle that would feed on itself.

====Brooklyn–Battery link====
In the late 1930s a municipal controversy raged over whether an additional vehicular link between Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan should be built as a bridge or a tunnel. Bridges can be wider and cheaper to build, but taller and longer bridges use more ramp space at landfall than tunnels do. A &quot;Brooklyn Battery Bridge&quot; would have decimated Battery Park and physically encroached on the financial district, and for this reason, the bridge was opposed by the Regional Plan Association, historical preservationists, Wall Street financial interests, property owners, various high society people, construction unions, the Manhattan borough president, Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, and governor Herbert H. Lehman. Despite this, Moses favored a bridge, which could both carry more automobile traffic and serve as a higher visibility monument than a tunnel. LaGuardia and Lehman as usual had little money to spend, in part due to the Great Depression, while the federal government was running low on funds after recently spending $105 million ($1.8 billion in 2016) on the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and other City projects and refused to provide any additional funds to New York. Awash in funds from Triborough Bridge tolls, Moses deemed that money could only be spent on a bridge. He also clashed with the chief engineer of the project, Ole Singstad, who preferred a tunnel instead of a bridge.

Only a lack of a key federal approval thwarted the bridge project. President Roosevelt ordered the War Department to assert that bombing a bridge in that location would block East River access to the Brooklyn Navy Yard upstream. Thwarted, Moses dismantled the New York Aquarium on Castle Clinton and moved it to Coney Island in Brooklyn, where it grew much bigger. This was in apparent retaliation, based on specious claims that the proposed tunnel would undermine Castle Clinton&#x27;s foundation. He also attempted to raze Castle Clinton itself, the historic fort surviving only after being transferred to the federal government. Moses now had no other option for a trans-river crossing than to build a tunnel. He commissioned the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel (now officially the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel), a tunnel connecting Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan. A 1941 publication from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority claimed that the government had forced them to build a tunnel at &quot;twice the cost, twice the operating fees, twice the difficulty to engineer, and half the traffic,&quot; although engineering studies did not support these conclusions, and a tunnel may have held many of the advantages Moses publicly tried to attach to the bridge option.

This had not been the first time Moses pressed for a bridge over a tunnel. He had tried to upstage the Tunnel Authority when the Queens-Midtown Tunnel was being planned. He had raised the same arguments, which failed due to their lack of political support.

===Post-war influence of urban development and projects===
Moses&#x27;s power increased after World War II after Mayor LaGuardia retired and a series of successors consented to almost all of his proposals. Named city &quot;construction coordinator&quot; in 1946 by Mayor William O&#x27;Dwyer, Moses became New York City&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; representative in Washington. Moses was also given powers over public housing that had eluded him under LaGuardia. When O&#x27;Dwyer was forced to resign in disgrace and was succeeded by Vincent R. Impellitteri, Moses was able to assume even greater behind-the-scenes control over infrastructure projects. One of Moses&#x27;s first steps after Impellitteri took office was halting the creation of a citywide Comprehensive Zoning Plan underway since 1938 that would have curtailed his nearly unlimited power to build within the city and removed the Zoning Commissioner from power in the process. Moses was also empowered as the sole authority to negotiate in Washington for New York City projects. By 1959, he had overseen construction of 28,000 apartment units on hundreds of acres of land. In clearing the land for high-rises in accordance with the towers in the park concept, which at that time was seen as innovative and beneficial by leaving more grassy areas between high-rises, Moses sometimes destroyed almost as many housing units as he built.

From the 1930s to the 1960s, Robert Moses was responsible for the construction of the Triborough, Marine Parkway, Throgs Neck, Bronx-Whitestone, Henry Hudson, and Verrazzano-Narrows Bridges. His other projects included the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and Staten Island Expressway (together constituting most of Interstate 278); the Cross-Bronx Expressway; many New York State parkways; and other highways. Federal interest had shifted from parkway to freeway systems, and the new roads mostly conformed to the new vision, lacking the landscaping or the commercial traffic restrictions of the pre-war highways. He was the mover behind Shea Stadium and Lincoln Center, and contributed to the United Nations headquarters. On November 25, 1950, Governor Thomas E. Dewey appointed Moses along with former Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson and former Justice Charles C. Lockwood as a member of the Temporary Long Island Railroad Commission, installed after the Richmond Hill train crash on November 22, 1950, that claimed 79 lives. The Commission recommended the state purchase and operation by non-profit public authority of the railway service.

Moses had influence outside the New York area as well. Public officials in many smaller American cities hired him to design freeway networks in the 1940s and early 1950s. For example, Portland, Oregon hired Moses in 1943; his plan included a loop around the city center, with spurs running through neighborhoods. Of this plan, only I-405, its links with I-5, and the Fremont Bridge were built.

Moses himself did not know how to drive an automobile. Moses&#x27;s highways in the first half of the 20th century were parkways—curving, landscaped &quot;ribbon parks&quot; that were intended to be pleasures to travel on, as well as &quot;lungs for the city&quot;. However, post–World War II economic expansion, and notion of the automotive city, led to the creation of freeways, most notably in the form of the vast, federally funded Interstate Highway network.

====Brooklyn Dodgers====
When the owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Walter O&#x27;Malley, sought to replace the outdated and dilapidated Ebbets Field, he proposed building a new stadium near the Long Island Rail Road on the corner of Atlantic Avenue and Flatbush Avenue (next to the present-day Barclays Center, home of the NBA&#x27;s Brooklyn Nets). O&#x27;Malley urged Moses to help him secure the property through eminent domain, but Moses refused, having already decided to build a parking garage on the site. Moreover, O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s proposal — to have the city acquire the property for several times as much as he had originally said he was willing to pay — was rejected by both pro- and anti-Moses officials, newspapers, and the public, as an unacceptable government subsidy of a private business enterprise.

Moses envisioned New York&#x27;s newest stadium being built in Queens&#x27; Flushing Meadows on the former (and as it turned out, future) site of the World&#x27;s Fair, where it would eventually host all three of the city&#x27;s major league teams of the day. O&#x27;Malley vehemently opposed that plan, citing the team&#x27;s Brooklyn identity. Moses refused to budge and, after the 1957 season, the Dodgers left for Los Angeles and the New York Giants left for San Francisco. Moses was later able to build the 55,000-seat multi-purpose Shea Stadium on the site. Construction ran from October 1961 to its delayed completion in April 1964. The stadium attracted an expansion franchise, the New York Mets, who played at Shea until 2008, when the stadium was demolished and replaced with Citi Field. The NFL&#x27;s New York Jets also played its home games at Shea from 1964 until 1983, after which the team moved its home games to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey.

===End of the Moses era===

Moses&#x27;s reputation began to fade during the 1960s. Around this time, Moses&#x27;s political acumen began to fail him, as he unwisely picked several controversial political battles he could not possibly win. For example, his campaign against the free Shakespeare in the Park program received much negative publicity, and his effort to destroy a shaded playground in Central Park to make way for a parking lot for the expensive Tavern-on-the-Green restaurant earned him many enemies among the middle-class voters of the Upper West Side.
The opposition reached a climax over the demolition of Pennsylvania Station, which many attributed to the &quot;development scheme&quot; mentality cultivated by Moses even though it was the impoverished Pennsylvania Railroad that was actually responsible for the demolition. This casual destruction of one of New York&#x27;s greatest architectural landmarks helped prompt many city residents to turn against Moses&#x27;s plans to build a Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have gone through Greenwich Village and what is now SoHo. This plan and the Mid-Manhattan Expressway both failed politically. One of his most vocal critics during this time was the urban activist Jane Jacobs, whose book &quot;The Death and Life of Great American Cities&quot; was instrumental in turning opinion against Moses&#x27;s plans; the city government rejected the expressway in 1964.

Moses&#x27;s power was further eroded by his association with the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. His projections for attendance of 70 million people for this event proved wildly optimistic, and generous contracts for fair executives and contractors made matters worse economically. Moses&#x27;s repeated and forceful public denials of the fair&#x27;s considerable financial difficulties in the face of evidence to the contrary eventually provoked press and governmental investigations, which found accounting irregularities. In his organization of the fair, Moses&#x27;s reputation was now undermined by the same personal character traits that had worked in his favor in the past: disdain for the opinions of others and high-handed attempts to get his way in moments of conflict by turning to the press. The fact that the fair was not sanctioned by the Bureau of International Expositions (BIE), the worldwide body supervising such events, would be devastating to the success of the event. Moses refused to accept BIE requirements, including a restriction against charging ground rents to exhibitors, and the BIE in turn instructed its member nations not to participate. The United States had already staged the sanctioned Century 21 Exposition in Seattle in 1962. According to the rules of the organization, no one nation could host more than one fair in a decade. The major European democracies, as well as Canada, Australia, and the Soviet Union, were all BIE members and they declined to participate, instead reserving their efforts for Expo 67 in Montreal.
After the World&#x27;s Fair debacle, New York City mayor John Lindsay, along with Governor Nelson Rockefeller, sought to direct toll revenues from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority&#x27;s (TBTA) bridges and tunnels to cover deficits in the city&#x27;s then financially ailing agencies, including the subway system. Moses opposed this idea and fought to prevent it. Lindsay then removed Moses from his post as the city&#x27;s chief advocate for federal highway money in Washington.

The legislature&#x27;s vote to fold the TBTA into the newly created Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) could have led to a lawsuit by the TBTA bondholders. Since the bond contracts were written into state law, it was unconstitutional to impair existing contractual obligations, as the bondholders had the right of approval over such actions. The largest holder of TBTA bonds, and thus agent for all the others, was the Chase Manhattan Bank, headed then by David Rockefeller, the governor&#x27;s brother. No suit was filed. Moses could have directed TBTA to go to court against the action, but having been promised a role in the merged authority, Moses declined to challenge the merger. On March 1, 1968, the TBTA was folded into the MTA and Moses gave up his post as chairman of the TBTA. He eventually became a consultant to the MTA, but its new chairman and the governor froze him out—the promised role did not materialize, and for all practical purposes Moses was out of power.

Moses had thought he had convinced Nelson Rockefeller of the need for one last great bridge project, a span crossing Long Island Sound from Rye to Oyster Bay. Rockefeller did not press for the project in the late 1960s through 1970, fearing public backlash among suburban Republicans would hinder his re-election prospects. A 1972 study found the bridge was fiscally prudent and could be environmentally manageable (according to the comparatively low environmental impact parameters of that period), but the anti-development sentiment was now insurmountable and in 1973 Rockefeller canceled plans for the bridge.

====&quot;The Power Broker&quot;====
Moses&#x27;s image suffered a further blow in 1974 with the publication of &quot;The Power Broker&quot;, a Pulitzer Prize–winning biography by Robert A. Caro. Caro&#x27;s 1,200-page opus (edited down from 2,000 or so pages) showed Moses generally in a negative light; essayist Phillip Lopate writes that &quot;Moses&#x27;s satanic reputation with the public can be traced, in the main, to ... Caro&#x27;s magnificent biography&quot;. For example, Caro describes Moses&#x27;s lack of sensitivity in the construction of the Cross-Bronx Expressway, and how he disfavored public transit. Much of Moses&#x27;s reputation is attributable to Caro, whose book won both the Pulitzer Prize in Biography in 1975 and the Francis Parkman Prize (which is awarded by the Society of American Historians), and was named one of the 100 greatest non-fiction books of the twentieth century by the Modern Library. Upon its publication, Moses denounced the biography in a 23-page statement, to which Caro replied to defend his work&#x27;s integrity.

Caro&#x27;s depiction of Moses&#x27;s life gives him full credit for his early achievements, showing, for example, how he conceived and created Jones Beach and the New York State Park system, but also shows how Moses&#x27;s desire for power came to be more important to him than his earlier dreams. Moses is blamed for having destroyed more than a score of neighborhoods by building 13 expressways across New York City and by building large urban renewal projects with little regard for the urban fabric or for human scale. Yet the author is more neutral in his central premise: the city would have developed much differently without Moses. Other U.S. cities were doing the same thing as New York in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s; Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle, for instance, each built highways straight through their downtown areas just as Moses wished to do in New York. The New York City architectural intelligentsia of the 1940s and 1950s, who largely believed in such proponents of the automobile as Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, had supported Moses. Many other cities, like Newark, Chicago, and St. Louis, also built massive, unattractive public housing projects. Caro also points out that Moses demonstrated racist tendencies. These allegedly included opposing black World War II veterans to move into a residential complex specifically designed for these veterans, and purportedly trying to make swimming pool water cold in order to drive away potential African American residents in white neighborhoods.

People had come to see Moses as a bully who disregarded public input, but until the publication of Caro&#x27;s book, they had not known many details of his private life—for instance, that his older brother Paul had spent much of his life in poverty. Moses was said to have blocked Paul, an engineer, from being hired for any public service jobs including major infrastructure projects that Moses himself had spearheaded. Paul, whom Caro interviewed shortly before the former&#x27;s death, claimed Robert had exerted undue influence on their mother to change her will in Robert&#x27;s favor shortly before her death. Caro notes that Paul was on bad terms with their mother over a long period and she may have changed the will of her own accord, and implies that Robert&#x27;s subsequent treatment of Paul may have been legally justifiable but was morally questionable.

==Death==
During the last years of his life, Moses concentrated on his lifelong love of swimming and was an active member of the Colonie Hill Health Club.

Moses died of heart disease on July 29, 1981, at the age of 92 at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip, New York.

Moses was of Jewish origin and raised in a secularist manner inspired by the Ethical Culture movement of the late 19th century. He was a convert to Christianity and was interred in a crypt in an outdoor community mausoleum in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City following services at St. Peter&#x27;s by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Bay Shore, New York.

==Legacy==

Various locations and roadways in New York State bear Moses&#x27;s name. These include two state parks, Robert Moses State Park – Thousand Islands in Massena, New York and Robert Moses State Park – Long Island, the Robert Moses Causeway on Long Island, and the Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant in Lewiston, New York. The Niagara Scenic Parkway in Niagara Falls, New York was originally named the Robert Moses State Parkway in his honor; its name was changed in 2016. The Moses-Saunders Power Dam in Massena, New York also bears his name. Moses also has a school named after him in North Babylon, New York on Long Island; there is also a Robert Moses Playground in New York City. There are other signs of the surviving appreciation held for him by some circles of the public. A statue of Moses was erected next to the Village Hall in his long-time hometown, Babylon Village, New York.

During his tenure as chief of the state park system, the state&#x27;s inventory of parks grew to nearly . By the time he left office, he had built 658 playgrounds in New York City alone, plus of parkways and 13 bridges. The proportion of public benefit corporations is greater in New York than in any other U.S. state, however, making them the prime mode of infrastructure building and maintenance in New York and accounting for 90% of the state&#x27;s debt.

==Appraisal==

===Criticism and &quot;The Power Broker&quot;===

Moses&#x27;s life was most famously characterized in Robert Caro&#x27;s 1974 award-winning biography &quot;The Power Broker&quot;.

The book highlighted his practice of starting projects certain to cost more than the initial funding approved by the New York State legislature, knowing the legislature would eventually have to fund the full project to avoid appearing to have provided ineffective oversight (). He was also characterized as using his political power to benefit cronies, including a case in which he secretly shifted the planned route of the Northern State Parkway large distances to avoid impinging on the estates of the rich, but told owners of the family farms who lost land that it was an unbiased decision based on &quot;engineering considerations.&quot; The book also charged that Moses libeled officials who opposed him, attempting to have them removed from office by calling them communists during the Red Scare. The biography further notes that Moses fought against schools and other public needs in favor of his preference for parks.

Moses&#x27;s critics charge that he preferred automobiles over people. They point out that he displaced hundreds of thousands of residents in New York City and destroyed traditional neighborhoods by building multiple expressways through them. The projects contributed to the ruin of the South Bronx and the amusement parks of Coney Island, caused the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants Major League baseball teams to relocate to Los Angeles and San Francisco respectively, and precipitated the decline of public transport from disinvestment and neglect. His building of expressways also hindered the proposed expansion of the New York City Subway from the 1930s to well into the 1960s because the parkways and expressways that were built replaced, at least to some extent, the planned subway lines. The 1968 Program for Action (which was never completed) was hoped to counter that. Other critics charge that he precluded the use of public transit, which would have allowed non-car-owners to enjoy the elaborate recreation facilities he built.

====Racism====
Caro&#x27;s &quot;The Power Broker&quot; also accused Moses of building low bridges across his parkways to make them inaccessible to public transit buses, thereby restricting &quot;the use of state parks by poor and lower-middle-class families&quot; who did not own cars. Caro also wrote that Moses attempted to discourage Black people in particular from visiting Jones Beach, the centerpiece of the Long Island state park system, by such measures as making it difficult for Black groups to get permits to park buses, and assigning Black lifeguards to &quot;distant, less developed beaches&quot;. While the exclusion of commercial vehicles and the use of low bridges where appropriate were standard on earlier parkways, where they had been instituted for aesthetic reasons, Moses appears to have made greater use of low bridges, which his aide Sidney Shapiro said was done to make it more difficult for future legislatures to allow access for commercial vehicles. Woolgar and Cooper refer to the claim about bridges as an &quot;urban legend&quot;.

Moses vocally opposed allowing Black war veterans to move into Stuyvesant Town, a Manhattan residential development complex created to house World War II veterans. In response to the biography, Moses defended his forced displacement of poor and minority communities as an inevitable part of urban revitalization: &quot;I raise my to the builder who can remove ghettos without moving people as I hail the chef who can make omelets without breaking eggs.&quot;

Additionally, there were allegations that Moses selectively chose locations for recreational facilities based on the racial compositions of a neighborhood, such as when he selected sites for eleven pools that opened in 1936. According to one author, Moses purposely placed some pools in neighborhoods with mainly white populations to deter African Americans from using them, and other pools intended for African Americans, such as the one in Colonial Park (now Jackie Robinson Park), were placed in inconvenient locations. Another author wrote that of 255 playgrounds built in the 1930s under Moses&#x27;s tenure, only two were in largely Black neighborhoods. Caro wrote that close associates of Moses had claimed they could keep African Americans from using the Thomas Jefferson Pool, in then-predominantly-white East Harlem, by making the water too cold. Nonetheless, no other source has corroborated the claim that heaters in any particular pool were deactivated or not included in the pool&#x27;s design.

In addition, Moses took a favorable view of the British Empire and a racism much broader than solely towards the African-American community, speaking of Empire as useful in stemming the &quot;rise of the lesser breeds without the law&quot;.

===Reappraisal===
Some scholars have attempted to rehabilitate Moses&#x27;s reputation by contrasting the scale of works with the high cost and the slow speed of public works in the decades following his era. The peak of Moses&#x27;s construction occurred during the economic duress of the Great Depression, and despite the era&#x27;s woes, Moses&#x27;s projects were completed in a timely fashion and have been reliable public works since then, which compares favorably to the delays that New York City officials have had in redeveloping the Ground Zero site of the former World Trade Center or to the delays and technical problems surrounding the Second Avenue Subway and Boston&#x27;s Big Dig project.

Three major exhibits in 2007 prompted a reconsideration of his image among some intellectuals, as they acknowledged the magnitude of his achievements. According to the Columbia University architectural historian Hilary Ballon and colleagues, Moses deserves a better reputation. They argue that his legacy is more relevant than ever and that people take the parks, playgrounds, and housing that Moses built, now generally binding forces in those areas, for granted even if the old-style New York neighborhood was of no interest to Moses himself. Moreover, were it not for Moses&#x27;s public infrastructure and his resolve to carve out more space, New York might not have been able to recover from the blight and flight of the 1970s and the 1980s to become today&#x27;s economic magnet.

&quot;Every generation writes its own history,&quot; said Kenneth T. Jackson, a historian of New York City to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2007. &quot;It could be that &quot;The Power Broker&quot; was a reflection of its time: New York was in trouble and had been in decline for 15 years. Now, for a whole host of reasons, New York is entering a new time, a time of optimism, growth and revival that hasn&#x27;t been seen in half a century. And that causes us to look at our infrastructure,&quot; said Jackson. &quot;A lot of big projects are on the table again, and it kind of suggests a Moses era without Moses,&quot; he added. Politicians are also reconsidering the Moses legacy; in a 2006 speech to the Regional Plan Association on downstate transportation needs, New York Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer stated a biography of Moses written today might be called &quot;At Least He Got It Built&quot;: &quot;That&#x27;s what we need today. A real commitment to get things done.&quot;

<doc id="284662" wikidata="Q5154265" url="?curid=284662" title="Communism in Peru">
<text>Communism as a political philosophy in Peru dates back to the 1920s, a period where new ideological currents entered the country.

Throughout the movement&#x27;s history, a number of parties, movements and organisations in the country have referred to themselves by the name of &quot;communist party&quot;. The oldest to do so is the Peruvian Communist Party (&quot;Partido Comunista Peruano&quot;, PCP), originally founded in 1928 as the &quot;Peruvian Socialist Party&quot;&#x27; (PSP) by Marxist philosopher and journalist José Carlos Mariátegui. The 1960s brought about the emergence of splinter groups up until the 21st century. One of these groups, commonly known as the Shining Path (PCP-SL), waged an insurgency against the Peruvian State that resulted in a 20-year period of violence that took place from 1980 to 2000, while its splinter groups have continued to operate from 2001 onwards.

== History ==
The first Peruvian political party to adopt communism as an ideology was the Peruvian Communist Party (&quot;Partido Comunista Peruano&quot;, PCP). It was originally founded as the Peruvian Socialist Party (PSP) in 1928 by a group of nine socialist sympathisers (known as the &quot;Group of Lima&quot;), which included Marxist philosopher and journalist José Carlos Mariátegui, and formally changed its name in 1930, following Mariátegui&#x27;s death and his succession by as party leader.

Following a period of outright illegality, the group gradually incorporated itself into the legal political scene during the 1960s, which led to the disappointment with its so-called burocratic and collaborationist character, believing that guerrilla warfare was the only path to the establishment of a socialist state. In 1962, a faction split and formed the National Liberation Army (ELN) a year later, which led such a military campaign until its defeat by 1965.

In 1963, the ongoing Sino-Soviet split separated the PCP into two rival factions, one pro-Soviet and the other pro-Chinese. The latter subsequently split from the Peruvian Communist Party in January 1964 and adopted the name &quot;Peruvian Communist Party – Red Flag&quot; (PCP-BR). The party was originally led by Saturnino Paredes, José Sotomayor, and Abimael Guzmán. Due to internal disagreements among the party&#x27;s three leaders, the party expelled several of its members in its early history. Two parties subsequently emerged from a 1969 split in the party: the Communist Party of Peru – Red Fatherland (PCP-PR) and the Communist Party of Peru – Shining Path (PCP-SL) led by Guzmán. Afterwards, Paredes became the party&#x27;s sole leader and renamed the party &quot;Peruvian Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist)&quot;. In response to the Sino-Albanian split, the party dropped its commitment to Maoism and aligned itself with the Party of Labour of Albania and Hoxhaism. In 1978, the &quot;PCP-Mayoría&quot; faction split from the PCP to form a more pro-Soviet branch, as it considered that the PCP had adopted Eurocommunism instead, operating until the 1980s.

The elections of 1980 formally ended the so-called Revolutionary Government of Francisco Morales Bermúdez, who had seized power from Juan Velasco Alvarado through a military coup in 1975. The previously banned socialist and communist parties participated in the elections, leading to the PCP attaining five seats in the constituent assembly, while left-wing groups as a whole achieved an important presence and united to form the United Left alliance, which formed one of the country&#x27;s main political forces during the 1980s.

In contrast to the aforementioned legal route of the political left, Guzmán&#x27;s PCP-SL began its war against the Peruvian government by burning ballots in Chuschi, a town in rural Ayacucho. Guzmán&#x27;s faction considered the political left as revisionists, openly and actively opposing them through its period of insurgency. The Shining Path&#x27;s leadership was captured and arrested by the Special Intelligence Group in 1992, and entered amnesty talks the following year. Rump factions of the group that opposed the peace talks have since continued a low-intensity insurgency that continues to this day, allying themselves with narcoterrorist groups in rural parts of the country, notably the Valle de los Ríos Apurímac, Ene y Mantaro (VRAEM).

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the PCP and other communist parties in Peru have since participated at a much smaller level in the country&#x27;s politics, mainly through broad left-wing political alliances.

== List of parties ==
A number of political parties claim the name and legacy of the original party founded in 1928, some using the original name. These parties include:
=== Other ===
A number of electoral fronts and alliances have brought together the aforementioned groups on different occasions:
*The name &quot;Socialist Vanguard Party&quot; was used by the PCP in order to facilitate its legal registration in 1945.
*United Left (IU): a loose alliance that gained a strong political presence in the 1980s.
*Revolutionary Left Union (UNIR): formed part of the IU from 1980 to 1993. Consisted of the PCP-PR, the VR-PC, and the FLN.

<text>Miniature wargaming is a form of wargaming in which military units are represented by miniature physical models on a model battlefield. Miniature wargames are played using model soldiers, vehicles, and artillery on a model battlefield, with the primary appeal being recreational rather than functional. Miniature wargames are played on custom-made battlefields, often with modular terrain, and abstract scaling is used to adapt real-world ranges to the limitations of table space. The use of physical models to represent military units is in contrast to other tabletop wargames that use abstract pieces such as counters or blocks, or computer wargames which use virtual models. The primary benefit of using models is immersion, though in certain wargames the size and shape of the models can have practical consequences on how the match plays out. Models&#x27; dimensions and positioning are crucial for measuring distances during gameplay. Issues concerning scale and accuracy compromise realism too much for most serious military applications. 

Miniature Wargames can be skirmish-level, where individual warriors are controlled, or tactical-level, where groups are commanded. Most wargames are turn-based, involving movement and combat resolved through arithmetic and dice rolls. The setting of a game determines the type of units used, with popular historical themes including WWII, the Napoleonic Wars, and the American Civil War, while &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; is the leading fantasy setting. Models, historically made from lead or tin, are now typically made of plastic or resin, with larger companies favoring plastic for its mass-production advantages. While some companies sell pre-painted models, most require assembly and customization by players. In historical miniature wargames, generic models are used, but fantasy wargames, like Warhammer, feature proprietary models, making them more expensive.

The community is social, with conventions and clubs playing a significant role. Painting and assembling models are integral aspects of the hobby. The hobby primarily attracts older enthusiasts due to the time, skill, and financial investment required.

==Overview==
A miniature wargame is played with miniature models of soldiers, artillery, and vehicles on a model of a battlefield. The benefit of using models as opposed to abstract pieces is primarily an aesthetic one. Models offer a visually-pleasing way of identifying the units on the battlefield. In most miniature wargame systems, the model itself may be irrelevant as far as the rules are concerned; what really matters is the dimensions of the base that the model is mounted on. Distances between infantry units are measured from the base of the model. The exception to this trend may be models of vehicles such as tanks, which do not require a base to be stable and have naturally rectangular shapes; in such cases, the distances between units may be measured from the edge of the model itself. Some miniature wargames use the dimensions of the model to determine whether a target behind cover is within line-of-fire of an attacker.

Most miniature wargames are turn-based. Players take turns to move their model warriors across the model battlefield and declare attacks on the opponent. In most miniature wargames, the outcomes of fights between units are resolved through simple arithmetic, usually combined with dice rolls or playing cards.

All historical wargames have a setting that is based on some historical era of warfare. The setting determines what kind of units the players can deploy in their match. For instance, a wargame set in the Napoleonic Wars should use models of Napoleonic-era soldiers, wielding muskets and cannons, and not spears or automatic rifles. A fantasy wargame has a fictional setting and may thus feature fictional or anachronistic armaments, but the setting should be similar enough to some real historical era of warfare so as to preserve a reasonable degree of realism. For instance, &quot;Warhammer Age of Sigmar&quot; is mostly based on medieval warfare, but includes supernatural elements such as wizards and dragons. The most popular historical settings are World War 2, the Napoleonic Wars, and the American Civil War (in that order). The most popular fantasy setting is &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;.

Miniature wargames are played either at the skirmish level or the tactical level. At the skirmish level, the player controls the warriors individually, whereas in a tactical level game he or she controls groups of warriors—typically the model warriors are mounted in groups on the same base. Miniature wargames are not played at the strategic or operational level because at that scale the models would become imperceptibly tiny.

Miniature wargames are generally played for recreation, as the physical limitations of the medium prevents it from representing modern warfare accurately enough for use in military instruction and research (see the section below on abstract scaling for one reason). A historical exception to this is naval wargaming before the advent of computers.

==Models==

Historically, these models were commonly made of tin or lead, but nowadays they are usually made of polystyrene or resin. Plastic models are cheaper to mass-produce but require a larger investment because they require expensive steel molds. Lead and tin models, by contrast, can be cast in cheap rubber molds. Larger firms such as Games Workshop prefer to produce plastic models, whereas smaller firms with less money prefer metal models.

Wargaming figurines often come with unrealistic body proportions. Their hands may be oversized, or their rifles excessively thick. One reason for this is to make the models more robust: thicker parts are less likely to bend or break. Another reason is that manufacturing methods often stipulate a minimum thickness for casting because molten plastic has difficulty flowing through thin channels in the mold. Finally, odd proportions may actually make the model look better for its size by accentuating certain features that the human eye focuses on.

===Assembly and painting===
Wargaming models are often sold in parts. In the case of plastic models, they&#x27;re often sold still affixed to their sprues. The player is expected to cut out the parts and glue them together. This is the norm because, depending on the design of the model, it may not be possible to mold it whole, and selling the parts un-assembled saves on labor costs. After assembling the model, the player should then paint it to make it more presentable and easier to identify on the game table. Understandably, the time and skill involved in assembling and painting models deters many people from miniature wargaming. Some firms have tried to address this by selling pre-assembled and pre-painted models, but these are rare because, with current technologies, it is hard to mass-produce ready-to-play miniatures that are both cheap and match the beauty of hand-painted models. The other options for players are to buy finished models second-hand or hire a professional painter.

===Proprietary models vs generic models===
Historical miniature wargames are typically designed to use generic models. It is generally not possible to copyright the look of a historical soldier. Anyone, for instance, may freely produce miniature models of Napoleonic infantrymen. A player of a Napoleonic-era wargame could thus obtain their models from any manufacturer who produces Napoleonic models at the requisite scale. Consequently, it is difficult if not impossible for a historical wargame designer to oblige players to buy models from a certain manufacturer.
By contrast, fantasy wargames feature fictional warriors, and fictional characters can be copyrighted. By incorporating original characters into their wargame, a wargame designer can oblige the player to purchase their models from a specific manufacturer who is licensed to produce the requisite models. An example of this is &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; which features many original characters who have a distinctive aesthetic, and Games Workshop and its subsidiaries reserve the exclusive right to manufacture models of these characters. Games Workshop models tend to be expensive because competing manufacturers are not allowed to offer cheaper copies of official &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; models. While there&#x27;s nothing to stop players using foreign wargaming models (generics or proprietary models from other wargames), doing so could spoil the aesthetic and cause confusion.

==Playing field==

A miniature wargame is played on a model of a battlefield. The model battlefield is usually mounted on a table. As far as size goes, every part of the battlefield should be within arm&#x27;s reach of the players; a width of four feet is recommended.

Most miniature wargames are played on custom-made battlefields made using modular terrain models.

Historical wargamers sometimes re-enact historical battles, but this is relatively rare. Players more often prefer to design their own scenarios. The first advantage is that they can design a scenario that fits the resources they have at hand, whereas reconstructing a historical battle may require them to purchase additional models and rulebooks, and perhaps a larger game table. The second advantage is that a fictional scenario can be designed such that either player has a fair chance of winning.

Miniature wargames are rarely set in urban environments. The first reason is that it is harder to reach models when there are many buildings in the way. Another reason is that the buildings may highlight the abstract scale at which the wargame operates. For instance, in the 28 mm wargame &quot;Bolt Action&quot;, a rifle&#x27;s range is 24 inches, which is barely the length of a few houses at 28 mm scale. If placed in an urban environment, a rifleman would not be able to hit a target at the far end of a small street, which shatters the illusion of realism.

==Scale==
===Model size===

The scale of a model vehicle can be expressed as a scale ratio. A scale ratio of 1:100 means that 1 cm represents 100 cm; at this scale, if a model car is 4.5 cm long, then it represents a real car that is 4.5 m long.

When it comes to figurines of humans, the preferred method of expressing scale is the height of a figurine in millimeters. There is no standardized system of measuring figurine size in the wargaming hobby. Some manufacturers measure the height of a figurine up to the crown of the head, whereas others may measure it up to the eyes (the latter is more sensible if the figurine is wearing a hat). Furthermore, the advertised scale of a model may not reflect its actual scale. In order to make their products stand out against their competitors, some manufacturers make their models a little oversized, e.g. a model from a certain manufacturer that is advertised as suitable for 28 mm wargames could actually be 30 mm tall in practice. This makes the model look more imposing, and allows for more detail.

Manufacturers of generic wargaming models are generally obliged to build their models to some standard scale so as to ensure compatibility with third-party wargames. Manufacturers who make proprietary models designed exclusively for use in a specific wargame do not have this concern. For instance, &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; officially does not have a scale. It doesn&#x27;t need to conform to a standard scale, because Games Workshop is the exclusive manufacturer of official &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; models, said models are intended exclusively for use in &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;, and Games Workshop doesn&#x27;t want players using foreign models from other manufacturers.

===Abstract scaling===
Most miniature wargames do not have an absolute scale, i.e. where the figurines, terrain, movement and firing ranges all conform to single scale ratio. This is largely because of the need to compress the battle into the confined space of a table surface. Instead, miniature wargames prefer to use abstract scaling.

For example, a 28 mm model rifleman realistically ought to be able to hit a target from 20 feet away, but this is larger than most tables. A miniature wargame would not be much fun if the models could shoot each other from opposite ends of the table, and thus not have to maneuver around the battlefield. The 28 mm wargame &quot;Bolt Action&quot; solves this problem by compressing the range of a rifle to just 24 inches; likewise, a sub-machine gun&#x27;s range is 12 inches and a pistol&#x27;s range is 6 inches. These ranges may not be realistic, but at least their proportions do make intuitive sense, giving an illusion of realism.

Abstract scaling may also be applied to figures and terrain features, e.g. model houses and trees may be a little undersized compared the scale so as to make more room on the table for the warriors. Like wise model figures will often be oversize for the scale, for example many games use 25 mm figures appropriate to a 1:60 scale when the game is played at a larger scale such as 1:360.

===Time===
Most miniature wargames do not have a fixed time scale (i.e. how many seconds a turn represents). Most wargame rulebooks instead prefer to define how far a unit can move in a turn, and this movement range is proportioned to the size of a typical game table. For example, &quot;Bolt Action&quot; sets a movement range of six inches in a turn for most units.
==Rules==
There are many miniature wargaming rules, not all of which are currently in print, including some which are available free on the internet; many gamers also write their own, creating so-called &quot;house rules&quot; or &quot;club sets&quot;. Most rules are intended for a specific historical period or fictional genre. Rules also vary in the model scale they use: one infantry figure may represent one man, one squad, or much larger numbers of actual troops.

Wargaming in general owes its origins to military simulations, most famously to the Prussian staff training system Kriegsspiel. Consequently, rules designers struggle with the perceived obligation to actually &#x27;simulate&#x27; something, and with the seldom compatible necessity to make an enjoyable &#x27;game&#x27;. Historical battles were seldom fair or even, and the potential detail that can be brought to bear to represent this in a set of rules always comes at the cost of pace of the game and enjoyment. In Osprey Publishing&#x27;s book about the Battle of Crécy, from its series on historical campaigns, there is included a detailed section on wargaming the battle, in which Stuart Asquith writes:

He adds that unless at least the initial moves are recreated, &quot;then an interesting medieval battle may well take place, but it will not be a re-creation of Crécy.&quot; Still, rules aimed at the non-professional hobby market therefore inevitably contain abstractions. It is generally in the area of the abstraction liberties taken by the designers that the differences between rules can be found. Most follow tried and true conventions to the extent that a chess player would recognize wargaming merely as a different scaled version of his or her own game.

===Role-playing games===
During the 1960s and 1970s, two new trends in wargaming emerged: First were small-unit rules sets which allowed individual players to portray small units down to even a single figure. These rules expanded the abilities of the smaller units accordingly, to magnify their effect on the overall battle.

Second was an interest in fantasy miniatures wargaming. J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and his epic cycle &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; were gaining strong interest in the United States, and as a result, rules were quickly developed to play medieval and Roman-era wargames, where these eras had previously been largely ignored in favor of Napoleonic and American Civil War gaming.

The two converged in the early 1970s. The first known occurrence, from 1970, is a set of rules by Len Patt published in The New England Wargames Association&#x27;s bulletin, The Courier. In 1971 a set of medieval miniatures rules entitled &quot;Chainmail&quot;, published by a tiny company called Guidon Games, headquartered in Belfast, Maine included a fantasy supplement detailing rules for battle involving fantastic creatures. Later, in 1974, TSR designer E. Gary Gygax wrote a set of rules for individual characters under &quot;Chainmail&quot;, and entitled it &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Further developments ensued, and the role-playing game hobby quickly became distinct from the wargaming hobby which preceded it.

===Naval wargames===

Although generally less popular than wargames set on land, naval wargaming nevertheless enjoys a degree of support around the world. Model ships have long been used for wargaming, but it was the introduction of elaborate rules in the early 20th century that made the hobby more popular. Small miniature ships, often in 1:1200 scale and 1:1250 scale, were maneuvered on large playing surfaces to recreate historical battles. Prior to World War II, firms such as Bassett-Lowke in England and the German company Wiking marketed these to the public. After World War II, several manufacturers started business in Germany, which remains the center of production to this day, while other companies started in England and the United States.

Rules can vary greatly between game systems; both in complexity and era. Historical rulesets range from the ancient and medieval ships to the fleets of the Age of Sail and the modern era. Often the hobbyists have to provide their own models of ships. The 1972 game, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up The Ship!&quot;, called for pencil and paper, six-sided dice, rulers and protractors, and model ships, ideally of 1:1200 scale. The elaborate rules cover morale, sinking, fires, broken masts, and boarding. Dice determined wind speed and direction, and hence the ship&#x27;s speed and the use of its cannon by measuring angles with the protractor.

In naval wargaming of the modern period, &quot;General Quarters&quot;, primarily (though not exclusively) using six-sided dice, has established itself as one of the leading sets of World War I and II era rules.

Some land-based miniature wargames have also been adapted to naval wargaming. &quot;All at Sea&quot;, for example, is an adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game&quot; rules for naval conflicts. The game&#x27;s mechanics centered around boarding parties, with options for ramming actions and siege engines. As such, the ship&#x27;s scale ratio corresponds to the 25 mm scale miniatures used by &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Model ships are built by hobbyists, just as normal miniature terrain, such as &quot;great ships&quot; of Pelargir, cogs of Dol Amroth and Corsair galleys.

===Air wargames===
Air wargaming, like naval wargaming, is a smaller niche within the larger hobby of miniatures wargaming. Aerial combat has developed over a relatively short time compared with naval or land warfare. As such, air wargaming tends to break down into three broad periods:
* World War I – from the earliest days of air combat to the 1920s
* World War II – 1930s to the early 1950s
* &quot;Modern&quot; – the missile age

In addition there are science fiction and &quot;alternative history&quot; games such as &quot;Aeronefs&quot; and those in the &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; universe.

==History==
===Precursors===

Wargaming was invented in Prussia near the end of the 18th century. The earliest wargames were based on chess; the pieces represented real military units (artillery, cavalry, etc.) and squares on the board were color-coded to represent different terrain types. Later wargames used realistic maps over which troop pieces could move in a free-form manner, and instead of chess-like sculpted pieces they used little rectangular blocks because they were played at smaller scales (e.g. 1:8000). The Prussian army formally adopted wargaming as a training tool in 1824. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, wargaming spread around the world and was played enthusiastically by both officers and civilians.

===Birth===
In 1881, the Scottish writer Robert Louis Stevenson became the first documented person to use toy soldiers in a wargame, and thus he might be the inventor of miniature wargaming, although he never published his rules. According to an account by his stepson, they were very sophisticated and realistic, on par with German military wargames. Stevenson played his wargame on the floor, on a map drawn with chalk.
The English writer H. G. Wells developed his own codified rules for playing with toy soldiers, which he published in a book titled &quot;Little Wars&quot; (1913). This is widely remembered as the first rulebook for miniature wargaming. &quot;Little Wars&quot; had very simple rules to make it fun and accessible to anyone. &quot;Little Wars&quot; did not use dice or computation to resolve fights. For artillery attacks, players used spring-loaded toy cannons which fired little wooden cylinders to physically knock over enemy models. As for infantry and cavalry, they could only engage in hand-to-hand combat (even if the figurines exhibited firearms). When two infantry units fought in close quarters, the units would suffer non-random losses determined by their relative sizes. &quot;Little Wars&quot; was designed for a large field of play, such as a lawn or the floor of a large room, because the toy soldiers available to Wells were too large for tabletop play. An infantryman could move up to one foot per turn, and a cavalryman could move up to two feet per turn. To measure these distances, players used a two-foot long piece of string. Wells was also the first wargamer to use models of buildings, trees, and other terrain features to create a three-dimensional battlefield.

Wells&#x27; rulebook was for a long time regarded as the standard system by which other miniature wargames were judged. However, the nascent miniature wargaming community would remain very small for a long time to come. A possible reason was the two World Wars, which de-glamorized war and caused shortages of tin and lead that made model soldiers expensive. Another reason may have been the lack of magazines or clubs dedicated to miniature wargames. Miniature wargaming was seen as a niche within the larger hobby of making and collecting model soldiers.

===Post-War growth===
In 1955, an American named Jack Scruby began making inexpensive miniature models for miniature wargames out of type metal. Scruby&#x27;s major contribution to the miniature wargaming hobby was to network players across America and the UK. At the time, the miniature wargaming community was minuscule, and players struggled to find each other. In 1956, Scruby organized the first miniature wargaming convention in America, which was attended by just fourteen people. From 1957 to 1962, he self-published the world&#x27;s first miniature wargaming magazine, titled &quot;The War Game Digest&quot;, through which wargamers could publish their rules and share game reports. It had less than two hundred subscribers, but it did establish a community that kept growing.

Around the same time in the United Kingdom, Donald Featherstone began writing an influential series of books on wargaming, which represented the first mainstream published contribution to wargaming since &quot;Little Wars&quot;. Titles included : &quot;War Games&quot; (1962), &quot;Advanced Wargames&quot;, &quot;Solo Wargaming&quot;, &quot;Wargame Campaigns&quot;, &quot;Battles with Model Tanks&quot;, &quot;Skirmish Wargaming&quot;. Such was the popularity of such titles that other authors were able to have published wargaming titles. This output of published wargaming titles from British authors coupled with the emergence at the same time of several manufacturers providing suitable wargame miniatures (e.g. Miniature Figurines, Hinchliffe, Peter Laing, Garrison, Airfix, Skytrex, Davco, Heroic &amp; Ros) was responsible for the huge upsurge of popularity of the hobby in the late 1960s and into the 1970s.

In 1956, Tony Bath published what was the first ruleset for a miniature wargame set in the medieval period. In 1971, Gary Gygax developed his own miniature wargame system for medieval warfare called &quot;Chainmail&quot;. Gygax later produced a supplement for &quot;Chainmail&quot; that added magic and fantasy creatures, making this the first fantasy miniature wargame. This supplement was inspired by the growing popularity of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; novels by J. R. R. Tolkien.

Gygax later went on to develop the first tabletop role-playing game: &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was a story-driven game, but adapted wargaming rules to model the fights players could get in. Battles in &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; rarely featured more than a dozen combatants, so the combat rules were designed to model the capabilities of the warriors in very great detail. Strictly speaking, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; did not require miniature models to play, but many players found that using miniature models made the fights easier to arbitrate and more immersive.

===Commercial wargames with proprietary models===
In 1983, a British company called Games Workshop released a fantasy miniature wargame called &quot;Warhammer&quot;, which was the first miniature wargame designed to use proprietary models. Games Workshop at the time made miniature models for use in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. &quot;Warhammer&quot; was meant to encourage customers to buy more of these models. Whereas miniature models were optional in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, &quot;Warhammer&quot; mandated their use and the battles tended to be larger. Initially, &quot;Warhammer&quot; had a threadbare fictional setting and used generic stock characters common to fantasy fiction, but as time went on, Games Workshop expanded the setting with original characters with distinctive visual designs. Games Workshop&#x27;s official line of models for &quot;Warhammer&quot; eventually took on such a distinctive look that rival manufacturers could not produce similar-looking models without risking a lawsuit over copyright infringement. Although there was nothing to stop players of &quot;Warhammer&quot; from using foreign models from third-party manufacturers, doing so could spoil the aesthetic and cause confusion.

In 1987, Games Workshop released a science-fiction spinoff of &quot;Warhammer&quot; called &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot;. Like &quot;Warhammer&quot;, &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; obliged players to buy proprietary models from Games Workshop. &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; became even more successful than &quot;Warhammer&quot;. The success of the &quot;Warhammer&quot; games promoted the sales of Games Workshop&#x27;s line of gaming models.

Other game companies sought to emulate Games Workshop&#x27;s business model. Examples include Mantic Games, Fantasy Flight Games, Privateer Press, and Warlord Games, all of which have released their own miniature wargame systems that were designed to promote sales of their respective lines of proprietary gaming models. This business model has proven lucrative, and thanks to the marketing resources of these companies, sci-fi / fantasy wargames have displaced historical wargames in popularity.

==Community and culture==

Players of miniature wargames tend to be more extroverted than players of board wargames and computer wargames. Players of miniature wargames are obliged to meet in person and play in the same room around a table, whereas board wargames can be played via correspondence and computer wargames can be played online; therefore miniature wargaming places a premium on sociability. (This has changed somewhat with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wargamers (miniature and board) have become quite creative in devising ways to play games while maintaining social distancing.)

Consequently, conventions and clubs are important to the wargaming community. Some conventions have become very large affairs, such as Gen-Con, Origins and Historical Miniatures Gaming Society&#x27;s &quot;Historicon&quot;, called the &quot;mother of all wargaming conventions&quot;. Players also tend to be middle-aged or older. One reason is that the hobby is expensive and needs higher disposable income that older people tend to have.

=== Organizations ===
*International Wargames Federation (IWF) promotes historical wargaming competitions between players or teams from different countries. 
*Johnny Reb Gaming Society – the leading international gaming society devoted exclusively to wargaming the American Civil War; publishes the quarterly &quot;CHARGE!&quot; newsletter for members of the society.
* Wargame Developments (WD) was founded by game designer and author Paddy Griffith in 1980, and is an international group dedicated to developing all types of wargames. It publishes a journal, &quot;The Nugget&quot;, nine times per year and holds a 3-day long conference, COW (The Conference of Wargamers), every July.
*Historical Miniatures Gaming Society (HMGS) - HMGS, Inc. is a non-profit, charitable and educational 501(c)3 organization whose purpose is to promote the study of military history through the art of tabletop miniature wargaming. HMGS holds several of the largest wargaming conventions in the United States annually.
*Mind Sports South Africa started as the South African Wargames Union in 1984. It was the first wargaming body to have wargames recognized as a sport in the same way as which chess is so recognized. As a result, South African teams were awarded Springbok Colours (1991–1994) and Protea Colours (1995 to date).
* The Solo Wargamers Association (SWA) founded in 1976 supports solo players in all branches of wargaming – historical, science fiction, fantasy, miniatures, board games etc. Publishes a quarterly journal Lone Warrior.

<doc id="284676" wikidata="Q168154" url="?curid=284676" title="Once Upon a Time in the West">
<text>Once Upon a Time in the West (, &quot;Once upon a time (there was) the West&quot;) is a 1968 epic spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone, who co-wrote it with Sergio Donati based on a story by Dario Argento, Bernardo Bertolucci and Leone. It stars Henry Fonda, cast against type as the villain, Charles Bronson as his nemesis, Jason Robards as a bandit and Claudia Cardinale as a newly widowed homesteader. The widescreen cinematography was by Tonino Delli Colli and the acclaimed film score was by Ennio Morricone.

After directing &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, Leone decided to retire from Westerns and aimed to produce his film based on the novel &quot;The Hoods&quot;, which eventually became &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;. However, Leone accepted an offer from Paramount Pictures providing Henry Fonda and a budget to produce another Western. He recruited Bertolucci and Argento to devise the plot of the film in 1966, researching other Western films in the process. After Clint Eastwood turned down an offer to play the movie&#x27;s protagonist, Bronson was offered the role. During production, Leone recruited Donati to rewrite the script due to concerns over time limitations.

The original version by the director was 165 minutes when it was first released on December 21, 1968. This version was shown in European cinemas, and was a box-office success. For the US release on May 28, 1969, &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; was edited down to 140 minutes by Paramount and was a financial flop.

The film is the first installment in Leone&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; trilogy, followed by &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, though the films do not share any characters in common.

In 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The film is regarded as one of the greatest Westerns of all time and one of the greatest films of all time.

==Plot==

A train arrives at the Old West town of &quot;Flagstone&quot; where a man with a harmonica (later dubbed &quot;Harmonica&quot;) overcomes an ambush by killing three men in dusters. Although Harmonica was expecting to meet an outlaw named Frank, he concludes by the dusters the men belonged to the outlaw Cheyenne&#x27;s gang. It is not yet revealed why Harmonica seeks Frank. Meanwhile, Frank and his gang murder Brett McBain and his three children as they prepare for a celebration at his ranch called &quot;Sweetwater.&quot; Shortly thereafter, a former prostitute arrives at Sweetwater and reveals she is Jill McBain, who married McBain a month before in New Orleans. Frank leaves evidence at the murder scene implicating Cheyenne. Jill is shocked at the murders and searches for a motive. Frank is a hired gun for railway tycoon Morton, who directed Frank to intimidate, not murder, McBain. McBain intended to profit by building a watering station on Sweetwater, because he knew the railroad from Flagstone would eventually pass through his property. However, if the station was incomplete by the time the railroad reached Sweetwater, the property would revert to the railroad. McBain&#x27;s murder puts Morton at odds with Frank, who desires the land for himself. Jill&#x27;s unexpected appearance makes her the owner of Sweetwater as McBain&#x27;s surviving widow.

Harmonica encounters Cheyenne, now a fugitive, who denies his men were sent to ambush him. Harmonica saves Jill from two of Frank&#x27;s men and spies out the railway carriage where Morton (owing to his spinal tuberculosis) is confined on crutches. Harmonica discovers the connection between Frank and Morton but is seen and captured. Frank is called away and Cheyenne rescues Harmonica. The two collaborate to help Jill save Sweetwater, using stockpiled materials to start building a station.

After a threatening sexual encounter with Frank, Jill is forced to auction the land; but, Frank&#x27;s henchmen intimidate the bidders in order to purchase it for Frank at a low price. Harmonica appears with Cheyenne in tow and bids $5,000, which is the price on Cheyenne&#x27;s head as a wanted fugitive. Frank is unsuccessful in buying Harmonica out, and wonders why Harmonica is pursuing him. Morton bribes Frank&#x27;s own men to kill him, but Harmonica intervenes to save Frank, because of his unfinished business with him.

Cheyenne escapes custody and he and his gang engage Frank&#x27;s remaining men in a gunfight on Morton&#x27;s train. Except for Cheyenne, who heads to Sweetwater, everyone is killed, including Morton. When Frank sees the aftermath of the fight, he rides to Sweetwater too, where he finds Harmonica waiting. Cheyenne has arrived earlier, but he remains in the ranch house with Jill. Outside, Harmonica and Frank engage in a showdown. Through a flashback, it is revealed that Frank had once shoved a harmonica into the mouth of a boy while he supported his older brother on his shoulders as Frank was hanging him. When the boy collapses, the instrument flies from his mouth. Now Harmonica beats Frank to the draw and, as Frank lies dying, he pushes the harmonica into Frank&#x27;s mouth.

After Harmonica and Cheyenne leave Sweetwater together, Cheyenne collapses and dies from a gut wound he received in the gunfight with Morton. Harmonica puts the body on Cheyenne&#x27;s horse and rides off as Jill serves water to the railroad workers.

==Cast==
In addition to the credited cast, uncredited actors in the film include Enzo Santaniello (Timmy), Simonetta Santaniello (Maureen), and Stefano Imparato (Patrick) as the McBain children; Al Mulock as the third station gunman Knuckles; Conrado San Martín as Vecino, Marco Zuanelli as Wobbles, and Claudio Mancini as Harmonica&#x27;s brother.

Members of Cheyenne&#x27;s gang are played by Aldo Sambrell, Lorenzo Robledo, and Bruno Corazzari. Members of Frank&#x27;s gang are played by Román Ariznavarreta, Frank Braña, Antonio Molino Rojo, and Fabio Testi. 

==Production==
===Origins===
After making his American gunfighter epic &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, Leone had intended to make no more Westerns, believing he had said all he wanted to say. He had come across the novel &quot;The Hoods&quot; by the pseudonymous &quot;Harry Grey&quot;, a fictionalized book based on the author&#x27;s own experiences as a Jewish hood during Prohibition, and planned to adapt it into a film (17 years later, it would become his final film, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;). Leone, though, was offered only Westerns by the Hollywood studios. United Artists (which had produced the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot;) offered him the opportunity to make a film starring Charlton Heston, Kirk Douglas and Rock Hudson, but Leone refused. When Paramount offered Leone a generous budget along with access to Henry Fonda—his favorite actor, and one with whom he had wanted to work for virtually all of his career—Leone accepted the offer.

Leone commissioned Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento to help him devise a film treatment in late 1966. The men spent much of the following year watching and discussing numerous classic Westerns, such as &quot;High Noon&quot;, &quot;The Iron Horse&quot;, &quot;The Comancheros&quot; and &quot;The Searchers&quot; at Leone&#x27;s house, and constructed a story made up almost entirely of references to American Westerns.

Beginning with &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, which originally ran for three hours, Leone&#x27;s films had usually been cut (often quite considerably) for box-office release. Leone was very conscious of the length of &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; during filming and subsequently commissioned Sergio Donati, who had worked on several of Leone&#x27;s other films, to help him refine the screenplay, largely to curb the length of the film toward the end of production.

===Style and pacing===
For &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, Leone changed his approach over his earlier Westerns. Whereas the &quot;Dollars&quot; films were quirky and up-tempo, a celebratory yet tongue-in-cheek parody of the icons of the Wild West, this film is much slower in pace and somber in theme. Leone&#x27;s distinctive style, which is very different from, but very much influenced by, Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Sanshiro Sugata&quot; (1943), is still present, but has been modified for the beginning of Leone&#x27;s second trilogy, the so-called &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; trilogy. The characters in this film are also beginning to change markedly over their predecessors in the &quot;Dollars&quot; trilogy. They are not quite as defined and, unusual for Leone characters up to this point, they begin to change (or at least attempt to) over the course of the story. This signals the start of the second phase of Leone&#x27;s style, which was further developed in &quot;Duck, You Sucker!&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;.

The film features long, slow scenes with very little dialogue and little happening, broken by brief and sudden violence. Leone was far more interested in the rituals preceding violence than in the violence itself. The tone of the film is consistent with the arid semidesert in which the story unfolds, and imbues it with a feeling of realism that contrasts with the elaborately choreographed gunplay.

Leone liked to tell the story of a cinema in Paris where the film ran uninterrupted for two years. When he visited this theater, he was surrounded by fans who wanted his autograph, as well as the projectionist, who was less than enthusiastic. Leone claimed the projectionist told him, &quot;I kill you! The same movie over and over again for two years! And it&#x27;s so SLOW!&quot;

===Locations===

Interiors for the film were shot in Cinecittà studios, Rome.
The opening sequence with the three gunmen meeting the train was one of the sequences filmed in Spain. Shooting for scenes at Cattle Corner Station, as the location was called in the story, was scheduled for four days and was filmed at the &quot;ghost&quot; railway station in the municipality of La Calahorra, near Guadix, in the Province of Granada, Spain, as were the scenes of Flagstone. Shooting for the scenes in the middle of the railway were filmed along the Guadix–Hernán-Valle railway line. Scenes at the Sweetwater Ranch were filmed in the Tabernas Desert, Spain; the ranch is still located at what is now called Western Leone. The brick arch, where Bronson&#x27;s character flashes back to his youth and the original lynching incident, was built near a small airport 15 miles (24 km) north of Monument Valley, in Utah, and two miles from U.S. Route 163 (which links Gouldings Lodge and Mexican Hat). Monument Valley itself is used extensively for the route Jill travels towards her new family in Sweetwater.

===Casting===
Henry Fonda did not accept Leone&#x27;s first offer to play Frank, so Leone flew to New York to convince him, telling him: &quot;Picture this: the camera shows a gunman from the waist down pulling his gun and shooting a running child. The camera tilts up to the gunman&#x27;s face and... it&#x27;s Henry Fonda&quot;. Fonda also had not seen any of Leone&#x27;s previous work including his Dollars Trilogy with Clint Eastwood so Leone arranged a screening of the trilogy for the actor. After the screening and a meeting with Leone, Fonda called his friend Eli Wallach, who had co-starred in &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;. Wallach advised Fonda to do the film, telling him &quot;You will have the time of your life.&quot;

When he accepted the role, Fonda came to the set with brown contact lenses and a handlebar mustache. Fonda felt having dark eyes and facial hair would blend well with his character&#x27;s evil, and also help the audience to accept this &quot;new&quot; Fonda as the bad guy, but Leone immediately told him to remove the contacts and facial hair, saying he did not want Fonda to look like a cliche villain.

Leone said he cast Claudia Cardinale in part because she was an Italian national and, as such, they could get a tax break.

Leone wanted the three men who ambush Harmonica and are subsequently killed to be played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach in a symbolic killing of the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; which Leone wanted to put behind him. However, though Wallach was willing, Van Cleef was unavailable and Eastwood was not interested in the role.

French actor-filmmaker Robert Hossein was set to play a supporting role as a member of Frank&#x27;s gang, and is listed in the cast by some sources (including the AFI Catalog of Feature Films). However, Hossein stated in a 2015 featurette for his film &quot;Cemetery Without Crosses&quot; that he did not actually appear in the film.

===Localization===
Following the film&#x27;s completion, &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; was dubbed into several languages, including Italian, French, German, Spanish, and English. The film&#x27;s dialogue was translated into English by expatriate American actor Mickey Knox. For the English dub, the voices of many of the American cast, including Fonda, Bronson, Robards, Wynn, Wolff, and Lionel Stander, were used. However, the rest of the cast had to be dubbed by other actors – including Claudia Cardinale, who was dubbed by actress Joyce Gordon, Gabriele Ferzetti, who was voiced by Gordon&#x27;s husband, Bernard Grant, and Jack Elam.

==Music==

The music was written by composer Ennio Morricone, Leone&#x27;s regular collaborator, who wrote the score under Leone&#x27;s direction before filming began. As in &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, the haunting music contributes to the film&#x27;s grandeur and, like the music for &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, is considered one of Morricone&#x27;s greatest compositions.

The film features leitmotifs that relate to each of the main characters (with their own theme music), as well as to the spirit of the American West. Especially compelling are the wordless vocals by Italian singer Edda Dell&#x27;Orso during the theme music for Jill McBain. Leone&#x27;s desire was to have the music available and played during filming. Leone had Morricone compose the score before shooting started and played the music in the background for the actors on set.

Except for about a minute of the &quot;Judgment&quot; motif, before Harmonica kills the three outlaws, no soundtrack music is played until the end of the second scene, when Fonda makes his first entry. During the beginning of the film, Leone instead uses a number of natural sounds, for instance, a turning wheel in the wind, sound of a train, grasshoppers, shotguns while hunting, wings of pigeons, etc., in addition to the diegetic sound of the harmonica.

==Release==
===European release===
The film was a massive hit in France, and was easily the most successful film released there in 1969, with 14.8 million admissions, ranking seventh of all time. It sparked a brief fashion trend for duster coats, which took such proportions that Parisian department stores such as Au Printemps had to affix signs on escalators warning patrons to keep their &quot;maxis&quot;, as they were called, clear from the edges of moving steps to prevent jamming.

It was also the most popular film in Germany with admissions of 13 million, ranking third of all time.

===American release===
In the US, Paramount edited the film to about 145 minutes for the wide release, but the film underperformed at the box office, earning $2.1 million in North America.

These scenes were cut for the American release:
* The entire scene at Lionel Stander&#x27;s trading post. Cheyenne (Robards) was not introduced in the American release until his arrival at the McBain ranch later in the film. Stander remained in the credits, though he did not appear in this version at all.
* The scene in which Morton and Frank discuss what to do with Jill at the Navajo Cliffs.
* Morton&#x27;s death scene was reduced considerably.
* Cheyenne&#x27;s death scene was completely excised.

Otherwise, one scene was slightly longer in the US version than in the international film release: Following the opening duel (where all four gunmen fire and fall), Charles Bronson&#x27;s character stands up again, showing that he had only been shot in the arm. This part of the scene had been originally cut by director Sergio Leone for the worldwide theatrical release. It was added again for the U.S. market, because the American distributors feared American viewers would not understand the story otherwise, especially since Harmonica&#x27;s arm wound is originally shown for the first time in the scene at the trading post, which was cut for the shorter U.S. version.

The English-language version was restored to around 165 minutes for a re-release in 1984, and for its video release the following year.

===Director&#x27;s cut===
In Italy, a 171-minute director&#x27;s cut features a yellow tint filter, and several scenes were augmented with additional material. This director&#x27;s cut was available on home video until the early 2000s, and still airs on TV, but more recent home-video releases have used the international cut.

===Home media===

After years of public requests, Paramount released a two-disc &quot;Special Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; of &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; on November 18, 2003, with a running time of 165 minutes (158 minutes in some regions). This release is the color 2.35:1 aspect ratio version in anamorphic widescreen, closed captioned, and Dolby. Commentary is also provided by film experts and historians, including John Carpenter, John Milius, Alex Cox, film historian and Leone biographer Sir Christopher Frayling, Dr. Sheldon Hall, and actors Claudia Cardinale and Gabriele Ferzetti, and director Bernardo Bertolucci, a co-writer of the film.

The second disc has special features, including three recent documentaries on several aspects of the film:
* &quot;An Opera of Violence&quot;
* &quot;The Wages of Sin&quot;
* &quot;Something to Do with Death&quot;

The film was released on Blu-ray on May 31, 2011, with a limited edition 4K UHD Blu-ray released as part of the Paramount Presents series (#44) on May 14, 2024. A standard issue 4K UHD was released on January 15, 2025.

=== Restored version ===
A restored 4K version was published by Cineteca di Bologna in 2018, with improved colors and image quality.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In Italy, the film sold 8,870,732 tickets. In the United States, it grossed $5,321,508, from ticket sales. It sold a further 14,873,804 admissions in France and 13,018,414 admissions in Germany, for a total of tickets sold worldwide.

===Critical response===
&quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; was reviewed in 1969 in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; by Roger Ebert, who gave it two and a half stars out of four. He found the film &quot;good fun&quot; and &quot;a painstaking distillation&quot; of Leone&#x27;s famous style, with intriguing performances by actors cast against their type and a richness of detail projecting &quot;a sense of life of the West&quot; made possible by Paramount&#x27;s larger budget for this Leone film. Ebert complained, however, of the film&#x27;s length and convoluted plot, which he said only becomes clear by the second hour. While viewing Cardinale as a good casting choice, he said she lacked the &quot;blood-and-thunder abandon&quot; of her performance in &quot;Cartouche&quot; (1962), blaming Leone for directing her &quot;too passively&quot;.

In subsequent years, the film developed a greater standing among critics, as well as a cult following. Directors such as Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Quentin Tarantino, and Vince Gilligan have cited the film as an influence on their work. It has also appeared on prominent all-time critics lists, including &quot;Time&quot;″s 100 greatest films of the 20th century and &quot;Empire&quot;″s 500 greatest movies of all time, where it was the list&#x27;s highest-ranking Western at number 14. Popular culture scholar Christopher Frayling regarded it as &quot;one of the greatest films ever made&quot;.

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 96% approval rating based on 69 reviews, with an average score of 9.10/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;A landmark Sergio Leone spaghetti Western masterpiece featuring a classic Morricone score&quot;. Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 82 out of 100 based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Accolades===

* &quot;Time&quot; named &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; as one of the 100 greatest films of all time.

In 2017, it was then ranked at number 52 on &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s poll for &quot;The 100 Greatest Movies&quot; (the second-highest Western on the list).

* In 2009, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

** Frank – Nominated Villain
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated

==Film references==
Leone&#x27;s intent was to take the stock conventions of the American Westerns of John Ford, Howard Hawks, and others, and rework them in an ironic fashion, essentially reversing their intended meaning in their original sources to create a darker connotation. The most obvious example of this is the casting of veteran film good guy Henry Fonda as the villainous Frank, but many other, more subtle reversals occur throughout the film. According to film critic and historian Christopher Frayling, the film quotes from as many as 30 classic American Westerns.

The major films referenced include:
* &quot;The Comancheros&quot; (1961): The names &quot;McBain&quot; and &quot;Sweetwater&quot; may come from this film. Contrary to popular belief, the name of the town &quot;Sweetwater&quot; was not taken from Victor Sjöström&#x27;s silent epic drama &quot;The Wind&quot;. Bernardo Bertolucci has stated that he looked at a map of the Southwestern United States, found the name of the town in Arizona, and decided to incorporate it into the film. However, both &quot;Sweetwater&quot; and a character named &quot;McBain&quot; appeared in &quot;The Comancheros&quot;, which Leone admired.
* &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (1954): Jill and Vienna have similar backstories (both are former prostitutes who become saloonkeepers), and both own land where a train station will be built because of access to water. Also, Harmonica, like Sterling Hayden&#x27;s title character, is a mysterious, gunslinging outsider known by his musical nickname. Some of &quot;West&quot;&#x27;s central plot (Western settlers vs. the railroad company) may be recycled from Nicholas Ray&#x27;s film.
* &quot;The Iron Horse&quot; (1924): &quot;West&quot; may contain several subtle references to this film, including a low-angle shot of a shrieking train rushing towards the screen in the opening scene, and the shot of the train pulling into the Sweetwater station at the end.
* &quot;Shane&quot; (1953): The massacre scene in &quot;West&quot; features young Timmy McBain out hunting with his father, just as Joey does in this movie. The funeral of the McBains is borrowed almost shot-for-shot from &quot;Shane&quot;.
* &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956): Leone admitted that the rustling bushes, the silencing of insect sounds, and the fluttering grouse that suggests menace is approaching the farmhouse when the McBain family is massacred were all taken from &quot;The Searchers&quot;. The ending of the film—where Western nomads Harmonica and Cheyenne move on rather than join modern society—also echoes the famous ending of Ford&#x27;s film.
* &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (1950): The scenes in &quot;West&quot; at the trading post are claimed to be based on those in &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot;, but the resemblance is slight.
* &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&quot; (1962): The dusters (long coats) worn by Cheyenne and his gang (and by Frank and his men while impersonating them) resemble those worn by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and his henchmen when they are introduced in this film. In addition, the auction scene in &quot;West&quot; was intended to recall the election scene in &quot;Liberty Valance&quot;.
* &quot;The Last Sunset&quot; (1961): The final duel between Frank and Harmonica is shot almost identically to the duel between Kirk Douglas and Rock Hudson in this film.
* &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946): The character of Morton, the crippled railroad baron in &quot;West&quot;, was based on the character played by Lionel Barrymore in this film.

<text>A Gesamtkunstwerk (, &#x27;total work of art&#x27;, &#x27;ideal work of art&#x27;, &#x27;universal artwork&#x27;, &#x27;synthesis of the arts&#x27;, &#x27;comprehensive artwork&#x27;, or &#x27;all-embracing art form&#x27;) is a work of art that makes use of all or many art forms or strives to do so. The term is a German loanword accepted in English as a term in aesthetics.

== Background ==
The term was developed by the German writer and philosopher K. F. E. Trahndorff in his 1827 essay &quot;Ästhetik oder Lehre von Weltanschauung und Kunst&quot; (or &#x27;Aesthetics, or Doctrine of Worldview and Art&#x27;). The German opera composer Richard Wagner used the term in two 1849 essays, and the word has become particularly associated with his aesthetic ideals. It is unclear whether Wagner knew of Trahndorff&#x27;s essay.

In France in the 1850s, Viollet-le-Duc was a proponent of integrating major arts (architecture) and minor arts (decorative arts), &quot;un art total&quot;. This led to a fierce combat with the Beaux Arts academy in Paris who refused Viollet le Duc&#x27;s educational reforms in 1863. If his ideas had little success in France they spread around Europe through his teachings and books, like his &quot;Reasoned dictionary of French architecture and furniture.&quot; This book influenced an entire span of young architects around the world ; John Ruskin who used it intensely to teach his Arts and Crafts students (William Morris, Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Philip Webb... copied Viollet le Duc&#x27;s drawings), the entire Art Nouveau movement in Europe and the modernists thereafter. An example is the Maison Tasel de Horta in Brussels or the Villa Cavrois in Croix in the Nord department, designed by the architect Robert-Mallet Stevens. 

In the 20th century, some writers applied the term to some forms of architecture, while others applied it to film and mass media. 

==In opera==
===Before Wagner===
Some elements of opera had begun seeking a more &#x27;classical&#x27; formula at the end of the 18th century. After the lengthy domination of opera seria and the &quot;da capo aria&quot;, a movement began to advance the librettist and the composer in relation to the singers, and to return the drama to a more intense and less moralistic focus. This movement, &#x27;reform opera&#x27;, is primarily associated with Christoph Willibald Gluck and Ranieri de&#x27; Calzabigi. The themes in the operas produced by Gluck&#x27;s collaborations with Calzabigi continue throughout the operas of Carl Maria von Weber, until Wagner, rejecting both the Italian &quot;bel canto&quot; tradition and the French &#x27;spectacle opera&#x27;, developed his union of music, drama, theatrical effects, and occasionally dance.

However, these trends had developed fortuitously, rather than in response to a specific philosophy of art. Wagner, who recognised the reforms of Gluck and admired the works of Weber, originally wished to consolidate his view as part of his radical social and political views of the late 1840s. Previous to Wagner, others had expressed ideas about union of the arts, which was a familiar topic among German Romantics, as evidenced by the title of Trahndorff&#x27;s essay, &#x27;Aesthetics, or Theory of Philosophy of Art&#x27;. Others who wrote on syntheses of the arts included Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Ludwig Tieck and Novalis. Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s enthusiastic review of E.T.A. Hoffmann&#x27;s opera &quot;Undine&quot; (1816) admired it as &#x27;an art work complete in itself, in which partial contributions of the related and collaborating arts blend together, disappear, and, in disappearing, somehow form a new world&#x27;.

===Wagner&#x27;s ideas===

Wagner used the exact term &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; (which he spelt &#x27;Gesammtkunstwerk&#x27;) on only two occasions, in his 1849 essays &#x27;Art and Revolution&#x27; and &#x27;The Artwork of the Future&#x27;, where he speaks of his ideal of unifying all works of art via the theatre. He also used in these essays many similar expressions such as &#x27;the consummate artwork of the future&#x27; and &#x27;the integrated drama&#x27;, and frequently referred to &#x27;Gesamtkunst&#x27;. Such a work of art was to be the clearest and most profound expression of folk legend.

Wagner felt that the Greek tragedies of Aeschylus had been the finest (though still flawed) examples so far of total artistic synthesis, but that this synthesis had subsequently been corrupted by Euripides. Wagner felt that during the rest of human history up to the present day (i.e. 1850) the arts had drifted further and further apart, resulting in such &#x27;monstrosities&#x27; as Grand Opera. Wagner felt that such works celebrated bravura singing, sensational stage effects, and meaningless plots. In &#x27;Art and Revolution&#x27;, Wagner applies the term &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; in the context of Greek tragedy. In &#x27;The Art-Work of the Future&#x27;, he uses it to apply to his own, as yet unrealized, ideal.

In his extensive book &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; (completed in 1851), Wagner takes these ideas further, describing in detail his idea of the union of opera and drama (later called &quot;music drama&quot; despite Wagner&#x27;s disapproval of the term), in which the individual arts are subordinated to a common purpose.

Wagner&#x27;s own opera cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, specifically its components &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, represent perhaps the closest he, or anyone else, came to realizing these ideals. After this stage, Wagner came to relax his own strictures and write more conventionally &#x27;operatically&#x27;.

===Arts and Crafts movement===
William Morris (1834–1896), a British textile designer, poet, novelist, translator, and socialist activist, was associated with the British Arts and Crafts movement and largely influenced by the ideas of John Ruskin, who believed that industrialization led to a qualitative decline in artistically crafted goods. Morris believed a home must nurture harmony as well as infuse its inhabitants with a creative energy.

The quote &#x27;Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful&#x27; epitomized Morris&#x27; way of living of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;.

Morris&#x27; and Philip Webb&#x27;s Red House, designed in 1859, is a major example, as well as the Blackwell House in the English Lake District, designed by Baillie Scott. Blackwell House was built in 1898–1900, as a holiday home for Sir Edward Holt, a wealthy Manchester brewer. It is situated near the town of Bowness-on-Windermere with views looking over Windermere and across to the Coniston Fells.

== In architecture ==

Some architectural writers have used the term &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; to signify circumstances where an architect is responsible for the design and/or overseeing of the building&#x27;s totality: shell, accessories, furnishings, and landscape. It is difficult to make a claim for when the term &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; was first used to refer to a building and its contents (although the term itself was not used in this context until the late 20th century); already during the Renaissance, artists such as Michelangelo saw no strict division in their tasks between architecture, interior design, sculpture, painting and even engineering.

Historian Robert L. Delevoy has argued that Art Nouveau represented an essentially decorative trend that thus lent itself to the idea of the architectural &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;. Of course, it is equally possible it was born from social theories that arose out of a fear of the rise of industrialism.

Nonetheless, evidence of complete interiors that typify the concept of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; can be seen from some time before the 1890s. An increasing trend among architects in the 18th and 19th centuries was to control every facet of an architectural commission. As well as being responsible for the structure itself, they tried to extend their role to also include designing (or at least vetting) every aspect of the interior work. This included not only the interior architectural features but also the design of furniture, carpets, wallpaper, fabrics, light fixtures, and door-handles. Robert Adam and Augustus Welby Pugin are examples of this trend to create an overall harmonising effect which in some cases might even extend to the choice or design of table silver, china, and glassware.

=== Art Nouveau ===
The form and ideology of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; was regularly engaged with by the Art Nouveau artists and architects of the period. Belgians Victor Horta and Henry Van de Velde, Catalan Antoni Gaudí, French Hector Guimard, Scottish Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Austrian Josef Hoffmann, Russian-German Franz (Fyodor) Schechtel, Finn Eliel Saarinen, and many other architects also acted as furniture and interior designers.

Many Art Nouveau masterpieces were results of cooperation of artists of different fields:

* Villa Majorelle (1901–1902) in Nancy, France was created by architect Henri Sauvage, furniture designer Louis Majorelle, ceramist Alexandre Bigot, and stained glass artist Jacques Grüber.

* The Municipal House (1904–1912) in Prague, Czech Republic was designed by Osvald Polívka and Antonín Balšánek and painted by famous Czech painter Alphonse Mucha, and features sculptures of Josef Mařatka and Ladislav Šaloun.

* The Gresham Palace (1904–1906) in Budapest, Hungary was created by architects Zsigmond Quittner and Jozsef Vago; sculptors Géza Maróti, Miklós Ligeti, and Ede Telcs; stained glass artist Miksa Róth; and metalwork artist Gyula Jungfer.

* Works of Victor Horta:
** Hôtel Tassel, Hôtel Solvay, and Hôtel van Eetvelde were created in cooperation with stained glass master Raphaël Évaldre.
** Maison and Atelier Horta was created in cooperation with sculptor Pieter Braecke.

* Works of Lluís Domènech i Montaner: Palau de la Música Catalana and Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona:
** Sculptors Pablo Gargallo and Eusebi Arnau and mosaic master Mario Maragliano took part in both projects.
** Sculptor Miguel Blay, stained-glass designer Antoni Rigalt, and ceramist Lluis Brù i Salelles were involved in construction of Palau de la Música Catalana.
** Metalwork artist Josep Perpinyà was involved in construction of Hospital de Sant Pau.

* Works of Antoni Gaudí: Park Güell, Palau Güell, Sagrada Família, Casa Batlló, Casa Milá, and Casa Vicens in Barcelona and Colònia Güell in Santa Coloma de Cervelló:
** Mosaic master Mario Maragliano was involved in construction of Sagrada Família.
** Architect Francesc Berenguer i Mestres was involved in construction of Sagrada Família and Colònia Güell,
** Architect Joan Rubió was involved in construction of Sagrada Família, Casa Batlló, and Parc Güell.
** Multi-disciplinary artist Josep Maria Jujol helped Gaudí with Casa Batlló, Casa Milà, and Parc Güell.

* Stoclet Palace in Brussels was created by architect and designer Josef Hoffmann, painters Gustav Klimt and Fernand Khnopff, sculptor Franz Metzner, and mosaic master Leopold Forstner. The construction of the palace foreshadowed Art Deco and Modern architecture.

* Museum Villa Stuck is the work of artist Franz von Stuck and &#x27;was celebrated as a marvelously modern yet curious construction. Built along his guiding principle of the Gesamtkunstwerk the Villa Stuck combined all aspects of architecture, art, music, theatre, and life within its walls and garden&#x27;.

* In Switzerland, Bruno Weber Park, a sculpture garden by artist Bruno Weber, is a later example of an Art Nouveau piece inspired by &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;.

* Kirche am Steinhof, or the Church of St. Leopold, was designed by the architect Otto Wagner. It is the Roman Catholic oratory of the Steinhof Psychiatric Hospital in Vienna, Austria. The building is considered one of the most important Art Nouveau churches in the world. Dedicated to Saint Leopold, it was built between 1903 and 1907, and includes mosaics and stained glass by Koloman Moser, and sculptures of angels by Othmar Schimkowitz. The great majority of the other smaller details are the work of Otto Wagner himself. The statues on the two external towers represent Saint Leopold on the left and Saint Severin on the right, the two patron saints of Lower Austria, and are the work of the Viennese sculptor Richard Luksch.

=== Modernism ===
The architectural movement of Modernism also saw architects implementing this principle of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;.
Centre Le Corbusier is an example by famed Modernist architect Le Corbusier.
The Villa Cavrois mansion in France is another example of modernist &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;, designed by French architect Robert Mallet-Stevens.

The album Gesamtkunstwerk was released by Detroit, electro band Dopplereffekt in 1999 on International Deejay Gigolos 
The multi-media style pioneered by Dadaists such as Hugo Ball has also been called a &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;. &#x27;Towards the Merz Gesamtkunstwerk&#x27; was a University of Oregon graduate seminar that explored themes of Dadaism and &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;, especially Kurt Schwitter&#x27;s legendary Merzbau. They cite Richard Huelsenbeck in his German Dada Manifesto: &#x27;Life appears as a simultaneous confusion of noises, colours and spiritual rhythms, and is thus incorporated — with all the sensational screams and feverish excitements of its audacious everyday psyche and the entirety of its brutal reality — unwaveringly into Dadaist art&#x27;.

In 2011, Saatchi Gallery in London held &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk: New Art from Germany,&quot; a survey exhibition of 24 contemporary German artists.

An exhibition entitled &quot;Utopia Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;, curated by Bettina Steinbrügge and Harald Krejci, took place from January to May 2012 at the 21er Haus in Belvedere, Vienna. It was a &#x27;contemporary perspective of the historical idea of the total work of art&#x27; and included a display by Esther Stocker based on the idea of &#x27;the untidy nursery&#x27;, it housed works by Joseph Beuys, Monica Bonvicini, Christian Boltanski, Marcel Broodthaers, Daniel Buren, Heinz Emigholz, Valie Export, Claire Fontaine, gelatin, Isa Genzken, Liam Gillick, Thomas Hirschhorn, Ilya Kabakov, Martin Kippenberger, Gordon Matta-Clark, Paul McCarthy, Superflex, Franz West, and numerous others. An accompanying book exploring the topic was produced with the same name.

Many reviews have characterized the contemporary art exhibition the 9th Berlin Biennale as a &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;.

In 2017, prominent visual artists Shirin Neshat and William Kentridge directed operas at the Salzburg Festival.

== Other applications ==
The Catholic Mass has been cited as an example of a &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;, and one could consider various liturgical expressions to be similar examples. Beyoncé has created multiple works that have been considered examples of &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;.

Canadian development corporation Westbank, founded by Ian Gillespie, uses &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; as the founding idea behind the company&#x27;s vision and philosophy for urban development.

<text>The Intolerable Acts, sometimes referred to as the Insufferable Acts or Coercive Acts, were a series of five punitive laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774 after the Boston Tea Party. The laws aimed to punish Massachusetts colonists for their defiance in the Tea Party protest of the Tea Act, a tax measure enacted by Parliament in May 1773. In Great Britain, these laws were referred to as the Coercive Acts. They were a key development leading to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in April 1775.

Four acts were enacted by Parliament in early 1774 in direct response to the Boston Tea Party of 16 December 1773: Boston Port, Massachusetts Government, Impartial Administration of Justice, and Quartering Acts. The acts took away self-governance and rights that Massachusetts had enjoyed since its founding, triggering outrage and indignation in the Thirteen Colonies.

The British Parliament hoped these punitive measures would, by making an example of Massachusetts, reverse the trend of colonial resistance to parliamentary authority that had begun with the Sugar Act 1764. A fifth act, the Quebec Act, enlarged the boundaries of what was then the Province of Quebec notably southwestward into the Ohio Country and other future mid-western states, and instituted reforms generally favorable to the francophone Catholic inhabitants of the region. Although unrelated to the other four Acts, it was passed in the same legislative session and seen by the colonists as one of the Intolerable Acts. The Patriots viewed the acts as an arbitrary violation of the rights of Massachusetts, and in September 1774 they organized the First Continental Congress to coordinate a protest. As tensions escalated, the Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775, leading to the declaration of an independent United States of America in July 1776.

==Background==
Relations between the Thirteen Colonies and the British Parliament slowly but steadily worsened after the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War (French and Indian War) in 1763. The war had plunged the British government deep into debt, and so the British Parliament enacted a series of measures to increase tax revenue from the colonies. Parliament believed that these acts, such as the Stamp Act 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767, were legitimate means of having the colonies pay their fair share of the costs of maintaining the British Empire. Although protests led to the repeal of the Stamp and Townshend Acts, Parliament adhered to the position that it had the right to legislate for the colonies &quot;in all cases whatsoever&quot; in the Declaratory Act 1766.

Many colonists argued that under the unwritten British constitution, a British subject&#x27;s property could not be taken from him (in the form of taxes) without his consent (in the form of representation in government). Therefore, because the colonies were not directly represented in Parliament, it followed that Parliament had no right to levy taxes upon them, a view expressed by the slogan &quot;No taxation without representation&quot;. After the Townshend Acts, some colonial essayists took this line of thinking even further, and began to question whether Parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in the colonies at all. This question of the extent of Parliament&#x27;s sovereignty in the colonies was the issue underlying what became the American Revolution.

==Passage==
On 16 December 1773, a group of Patriot colonists associated with the Sons of Liberty destroyed 342 chests of tea in Boston, Massachusetts, an act that came to be known as the Boston Tea Party. The colonists partook in this action because Parliament had passed the Tea Act, which granted the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies, thereby saving the company from bankruptcy. This made British tea less expensive. In addition, there was added a small tax. This angered the colonists. News of the Boston Tea Party reached England in January 1774. Parliament responded by passing four laws. Three of the laws were intended to directly punish Massachusetts. This was for the destruction of private property, to restore British authority in Massachusetts, and to otherwise reform colonial government in America.

On 22 April 1774, Prime Minister Lord North defended the programme in the House of Commons, saying:

The Americans have tarred and feathered your subjects, plundered your merchants, burnt your ships, denied all obedience to your laws and authority; yet so clement and so long forbearing has our conduct been that it is incumbent on us now to take a different course. Whatever may be the consequences, we must risk something; if we do not, all is over.

== The Acts ==

The Boston Port Act was the first of the laws passed in 1774 in response to the Boston Tea Party. It closed the port of Boston until the colonists paid for the destroyed tea and the king was satisfied that order had been restored. Colonists objected that the Port Act punished all of Boston rather than just the individuals who had destroyed the tea, and that they were being punished without having been given an opportunity to testify in their own defense.

The Massachusetts Government Act provoked even more outrage than the Port Act because it unilaterally took away Massachusetts&#x27; charter and brought it under control of the British government. Under the terms of the Government Act, almost all positions in the colonial government were to be appointed by the governor, Parliament, or the king. The act also severely limited town meetings in Massachusetts to one per year, unless the governor called for one. Colonists outside Massachusetts feared that their governments could now also be changed by the legislative fiat of Parliament.

The Administration of Justice Act allowed the royal governor to order trials of accused royal officials to take place in Great Britain or elsewhere within the Empire if he decided that the defendant could not get a fair trial in Massachusetts. Although the act stipulated for witnesses to be reimbursed after having traveled at their own expense across the Atlantic, it was not stipulated that this would include reimbursement for lost earnings during the period for which they would be unable to work, leaving few with the ability to testify. George Washington called this the &quot;Murder Act&quot; because he believed that it allowed officials to harass colonists and then escape justice. Many colonists believed the act was unnecessary because British soldiers had been given a fair trial following the Boston Massacre in 1770.

The Quartering Act, which applied to all British colonies in North America, sought to create a more effective method of housing British troops. In a previous act, the colonies had been required to provide housing for soldiers, but colonial legislatures had been uncooperative in doing so. The new Quartering Act allowed a governor to house soldiers in other buildings if suitable quarters were not provided. While many sources claim that the Quartering Act allowed troops to be billeted in occupied private homes, historian David Ammerman&#x27;s 1974 study claimed that this is a myth, and that the act only permitted troops to be quartered in unoccupied buildings.

Although unrelated to the aforementioned Acts, the Quebec Act, passed in the same parliamentary session, was considered by the colonists to be one of the Intolerable Acts. The Act expanded the territory of the Province of Quebec into the Great Lakes region and much of what is now the Midwestern United States, which appeared to void the land claims of the Ohio Company on the region. The guarantee of free practice of Catholicism, the majority religion in Canada, was seen by colonists as an &quot;establishment&quot; of the faith in the colonies which were overwhelmingly Protestant. Furthermore, colonists resented the lenient provisions granted to their erstwhile enemies whom they had fought hard against during the French and Indian War.

==Effects==

Many colonists saw the Intolerable Acts as a violation of their constitutional rights, their natural rights, and their colonial charters. They, therefore, viewed the acts as a threat to the liberties of all of British America, not just Massachusetts. Legislation denouncing the act (the Loudoun and Fairfax resolves) was swift, and Richard Henry Lee of Virginia described the acts as &quot;a most wicked System for destroying the liberty of America&quot;.

The citizens of Boston viewed the Intolerable Acts as unnecessary and cruel punishment, further inflaming hatred toward Britain. Even more Bostonians turned against British rule.

Great Britain hoped that the Intolerable Acts would isolate radicals in Massachusetts and cause American colonists to concede the authority of Parliament over their elected assemblies. The calculated risk backfired: the harshness of some of the acts made it difficult for colonial moderates to speak in favor of Parliament. Instead, the acts only served to distance the colonies from the Crown, create sympathy for Massachusetts and encourage colonists from the otherwise diverse colonies to form committees of correspondence which sent delegates to the First Continental Congress. The Continental Congress created the Continental Association, an agreement to boycott British goods. Additionally, it was decided that if the Intolerable Acts were not reversed after a year, goods were to stop being exported to Great Britain as well. The Congress also pledged to support Massachusetts in case of attack, which meant that all of the colonies would become involved when the American Revolutionary War began at Lexington and Concord.

<doc id="284695" wikidata="Q1891869" url="?curid=284695" title="Manukau Harbour">
<text>The Manukau Harbour is the second largest natural harbour in New Zealand by area. It is located to the southwest of the Auckland isthmus, and opens out into the Tasman Sea.

==Geography==
The harbour mouth is between the northern head (&quot;Burnett Head&quot; / &quot;Ohaka Head&quot;) located at the southern end of the Waitākere Ranges and South Head at the end of the Āwhitu Peninsula reaching up from close to the mouth of the Waikato River. The mouth is only 1800 metres wide, but after a nine kilometre channel it opens up into a roughly square basin 20 kilometres in width. The harbour has a water surface area of 394 square kilometres. There is a tidal variation of up to 4 metres, a very substantial change, especially since the harbour, being silted up with almost 10 million years of sedimentation, is rather shallow itself.

Because of the large harbour area and narrow mouth between the Manukau Heads, tidal flow is rapid and a bar at the mouth makes navigating in or out of the harbour dangerous. New Zealand&#x27;s most tragic shipwreck occurred on the bar in 1863 when HMS &quot;Orpheus&quot; ran aground in clear weather with a loss of 189 lives. For this reason, along with the harbour&#x27;s shallowness, it is not Auckland&#x27;s favoured port, and, with only one short wharf, the facilities at Onehunga are tiny compared to the other Ports of Auckland facilities on the Waitematā Harbour along the northeast of the isthmus.

The harbour has three main arms. The Māngere Inlet at the northeast lies close to Auckland&#x27;s central city area, with the inner suburbs of Onehunga and Te Papapa situated close to its northern shore. The Ōtāhuhu and Māngere urban areas lie south of this arm, which is crossed by the Māngere Bridge. In the southeast is the Papakura Channel, which extends into the urban area of Papakura. In the southwest a further inlet known as the Waiuku River reaches south to the town of Waiuku. The harbour reaches into Māngere Lagoon, which occupies a volcanic crater. Auckland Airport is located close to the harbour&#x27;s eastern shore.

== Geology ==

The Manukau Harbour is a drowned river valley system, which formed between 3 and 5 million years ago when tectonic forces between the Pacific Plate and Australian Plate uplifted the Waitākere Ranges and subsided the Manukau Harbour. It began as an open bay, eventually forming as a sheltered harbour as elongated sand dune barriers formed at the harbour&#x27;s mouth. Over the last two million years, the harbour has cycled between periods of being a forested river valley and a flooded harbour, depending on changes in the global sea level. The present harbour formed approximately 8,000 years ago, after the Last Glacial Maximum.

== Names and etymology ==

There are various traditions associated with the naming of the harbour. A Tainui tradition involves the crew of the &quot;Tainui&quot;. As they crossed Te Tō Waka (the portage at Ōtāhuhu between the Manukau Harbour and the Tāmaki River), the crew believed they heard voices of people on the other side. When they reached the harbour, they found that this was only birds (&quot;Manu kau&quot;).

Another Tainui tradition involves Hoturoa, the captain of the &quot;Tainui&quot; waka. This tradition involves the naming of the Manukau Heads opening and sandbars, which is known as Te Manuka-o-Hotunui or Te Manukanuka-o-Hotunui, describing the anxiety Hoturoa felt when attempting to navigate this passage. The name, originally used for just the mouth of the harbour, became used for the entire harbour over time.

Other traditions hold that it is a corruption of mānuka, being a descriptive name for the number of mānuka shrubs growing around the harbour, while another asserts that Manukau is the name of a chief who died in the waters of the harbour.

Another traditional name for the harbour is Nga-tai-o-Rakataura, referring to Rakatāura / Hape, the tohunga of the &quot;Tainui&quot;. During the early colonial era of Auckland, an attempt was made to rename the harbour Symonds Harbour, after the late William Cornwallis Symonds, who died in 1841, battling a storm in the harbour.

== History ==
The harbour was an important historical waterway for Māori. It had several portages to the Pacific Ocean and to the Waikato River, and various villages and &quot;pā&quot; (hill forts) clustered around it. Snapper, flounder, mullet, scallops, cockles and pipi provided food in plentiful amounts. In Te Kawerau ā Maki tradition, the taniwha Paikea guards the Manukau Harbour and Waitākere Ranges coastline.

Cornwallis, on the Karangahape Peninsula, was the first site for the future city of Auckland. However, because of fraudulent land sales and rugged conditions, the settlement was mostly abandoned in the 1840s. The surrounding bush clad hills had vast amounts of kauri removed for milling and shipped from a wharf on Paratutai to either the other end of the harbour at Onehunga for use in house building in the new city of Auckland, or along the coast to other New Zealand settlements. The last mills were abandoned in the early 1920s.

European settlement of the area was thus almost often an outgrowth of the Waitematā Harbour-centred settlement, as these settlers spread south and west through the isthmus and reached the Manukau Harbour. One of the few separate earlier European settlements was Onehunga, from where some raiding of enemy settlements occurred during the New Zealand wars, and which later became a landing point for kauri and other products landed by ship and canoe from the south, the shipping route being shorter than the one along the east coast to the Waitematā Harbour. However, the combination of the difficult entry into the harbour, which limited ships to about 1,000 tons maximum, and the extension of the railway to Onehunga in 1873 made naval traffic on the harbour less important again, though the Port of Onehunga can trace its origins to this time.

Construction of a canal between the Manukau and the Waitemata was considered in the early 1900s, and the Auckland and Manukau Canal Act 1908 was passed to allow authorities to take privately owned land for this purpose. However, no serious work (or land take) was undertaken. The act was reported as technically still being in force as of 2008, but was repealed on 1 November 2010. A canal reserve, wide, remains in place.

==Recreation==

The harbour is popular for fishing, though entry to the water is difficult with few all-tide boat ramps; often local beaches are used. The harbour also houses five active sailing clubs, three on the southern side, one near Māngere Bridge, and one on the northern side. Since 1988, there has been an annual interclub competition, hosted by each club in rotation.

==Ecological threats==
Despite all that is precious about the Manukau, it is under ongoing threat from constant development and growth, with the pollution and damage that brings. Currently, according to the State of Auckland Marine Report Card, the harbour has a D-rating overall, based on water quality, contaminants and sediment, and ecology.

Careful and integrated management of land-based activities, such as development through good land-use practices, and commitment to a programme of integrated management is required to reverse this situation and secure a healthy, productive and sustainable resource for everybody now and for future generations.

In response to concern about the deteriorating state of the Manukau Harbour and the urgent need for a collaborative response to improve its condition, the Manukau Harbour Forum was created in November 2010 to advocate for the restoration of Manukau Harbour.

<text>The Rundown (known internationally as Welcome to the Jungle) is a 2003 American action comedy film directed by Peter Berg and written by James Vanderbilt and R.J. Stewart from a story by Stewart. It follows an aspiring chef working as a debt collector for a loan shark who is tasked with retrieving the loan shark&#x27;s son, who went to Brazil to search for a lost artifact. The film stars Dwayne Johnson, Seann William Scott, Christopher Walken and Rosario Dawson.

The film was released by Universal Pictures in the United States, Canada and Japan and by Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International under the Columbia Pictures label internationally on September 26, 2003. It received positive reviews but was a box office failure, grossing $80.9 million on an $85 million budget.

== Plot ==
Beck is an aspiring chef who works as a debt collector for loan shark and bookie Billy Walker. He is sent to a nightclub to retrieve a championship ring from a football player, during which he is assaulted by one of Billy&#x27;s other collectors. Angry, he tells Billy that he wants out of the business. Billy convinces him to undertake one final job: retrieve Billy&#x27;s son Travis from a small mining town in Brazil, for which Beck will be given enough money to open his own restaurant. He accepts and leaves for Brazil.

Arriving in the town of El Dorado, Beck meets Cornelius Hatcher, who runs the town&#x27;s mining operation. Cornelius gives Beck his blessing to take Travis home, but reneges after he finds out Travis has discovered a lost golden artifact known as O Gato do Diablo (the Devil&#x27;s Cat). Cornelius and his men confront Beck in the local bar, but he manages to fend them off and leave with Travis. On the way back to the airfield, Travis forces the pair&#x27;s Jeep off the road and into the jungle. He attempts to escape but is recaptured by Beck. After an unfortunate encounter with some monkeys, the two find themselves in the camp of a local rebel movement.

Travis convinces the rebels that Beck works for Cornelius and was sent to kill them all. Beck gains the upper hand in the ensuing fight before the rebel leader Mariana, whom Beck met earlier at the bar, intervenes. She wants the Gato so it can be used to ensure the locals can free themselves from Cornelius, but Cornelius and his men suddenly attack the camp and kill many rebels. Beck, Travis, and Mariana escape the camp and Beck makes Mariana a deal: she helps him get Travis to the airfield in exchange for the Gato. After some searching, Travis leads them to a cave behind a waterfall where the Gato is located. They retrieve it and begin the journey back.

On the way back, Mariana chastises Travis for wanting to sell the artifact, but he argues that he actually wants to give it to a museum. She gives Beck and Travis a toxic fruit that temporarily paralyzes them, tells Beck which direction the airfield is, and leaves them with a campfire to keep the animals away. After regaining the ability to move, Beck hauls Travis to the airfield. The local pilot, Declan, tells Beck that Mariana was captured earlier by Cornelius and will probably be killed. Travis pleads with Beck to help her and the two head into town to rescue her.

Using a cow stampede for cover, Beck and Travis begin their assault on Cornelius&#x27;s men. Travis becomes trapped by gunfire in a bus, and Beck saves him before it explodes. Cornelius tells his brother Harvey to flee with Mariana and the Gato, but they are stopped by Travis. Cornelius confronts Beck, who offers him the chance to leave town, which Cornelius refuses. After he is shot by the townspeople, he agrees to leave town, but eventually dies from his wounds. Travis gives the Gato to Mariana before leaving with Beck, who tells him that he must still return Travis to the United States despite all they have been through together.

Back in Los Angeles, Travis is delivered to Billy, who verbally and physically abuses him. Beck asks to celebrate with them and gives Billy and his men the same fruit Mariana used on him and Travis. As everyone else is temporarily paralyzed, Beck uncuffs Travis and the two leave together.

== Production ==
The movie was originally called &quot;Helldorado&quot;. It was offered to director Peter Berg, who had only made one film, &quot;Very Bad Things&quot;. Looking for inspiration on how to do it, Berg bought a DVD titled &quot;The 50 Best Fights Ever Filmed&quot;, which at first demotivated him: &quot;I just thought, &#x27;Good God, it&#x27;s all been done and it&#x27;s all been done so well, probably with more money than I&#x27;m going to have. What am I going to do?&#x27;&quot; He then saw the fight between Roddy Piper and Keith David in &quot;They Live&quot;, about which he said, &quot;It just hurt watching it. It was a completely different style from all these sexy and sleek movies. And thinking about it, I couldn&#x27;t remember the last time in a movie fight where I felt the pain, where if you got hit in the face, it hurt. So that&#x27;s where I found my breathing room: let&#x27;s give people old-school guys slugging it out with big punches.&quot; Producer Kevin Misher described the film as &quot;&quot;Indiana Jones and the Lost Ark&quot; meets &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; with a little bit of &quot;Midnight Run&quot;&quot;.

Dwayne Johnson, who was credited under his ring name The Rock, was paid $12.5 million for his role. Berg said of his performance, &quot;This movie could have been a dark, vicious action thriller. But the fact that it&#x27;s playful and funny is a tribute to The Rock. He&#x27;s a charming, charismatic and very smart man.&quot;

Berg and Misher were held up by armed robbers in Brazil in June 2002 while scouting locations, prompting them to film in Hawaii instead. Shooting began in September 2002, with Seann William Scott later stating &quot;we just basically made up as we went along&quot;. One scene on Oahu involved Johnson and Scott falling down the side of a mountain. Berg said, &quot;The goal was to put the biggest fall down a hill in a movie that people have ever seen. The big inspiration was the old &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;&#x27;and the agony of defeat&#x27;and wondering what would have happened if that poor bastard on the ski slope had had a few more stages to go.&quot; Johnson&#x27;s regular stuntman refused to do the stunt, so they hired &quot;a guy who has a reputation for just doing anything&quot; who was knocked out the first time.

Arnold Schwarzenegger has a cameo in the film. He visited Universal Studios during the shoot and was having lunch with Johnson when Berg asked if he would like to appear in the film, and Schwarzenegger agreed if they could do it immediately. His cameo as a bar patron who passes by Johnson&#x27;s character and simply tells him to &quot;have fun&quot; is widely regarded as a veiled reference to the fact that Johnson&#x27;s career as a Hollywood action star was just beginning as Schwarzenegger&#x27;s was winding down.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
Despite the positive reviews, &quot;The Rundown&quot; was a significant box office failure, grossing just under $81 million worldwide compared to its $85 million budget, which makes a sequel not entirely likely. Director Peter Berg has expressed interest in making a sequel to the film but notes that &quot;no one can ever get motivated and focused enough to do it.&quot;

=== Critical response ===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Rundown&quot; holds an approval rating of 70% based on 152 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;The Rundown&quot; doesn&#x27;t break any new ground, but it&#x27;s a smart, funny buddy action picture with terrific comic chemistry between Dwayne &#x27;The Rock&#x27; Johnson and Seann William Scott.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4, saying &quot;The jungle locations give the film a texture and beauty that underlines the out-sized characters.&quot;

== Possible sequel ==
In December 2009, Berg acknowledged that discussions for a sequel had begun shortly after the film&#x27;s release and were still ongoing. He cited scheduling conflicts as to why the project had not yet been green-lit. Johnson corroborated this in November 2010, stating that he and Berg &quot;are always discussing options&quot; for a sequel; he said that the pair are also in negotiations with Universal Pictures, and expressed confidence that the sequel will be made if a good enough script is written.

Berg announced in December 2013 that he was officially developing a sequel, confirming that Johnson was still interested while Scott would not return. A number of undisclosed screenwriters were hired for the project. By September 2016, Berg stated that the sequel had been written with Kevin Hart in mind as the co-star due to his recent work as Johnson&#x27;s co-star in multiple successful films, while also stating that he would alternatively consider making the film with Jonah Hill in the role. Johnson publicly confirmed his involvement with the project while proposing &quot;HellDorado&quot; (the first film&#x27;s working title) as a possible title. The pair asked fans to campaign for Hill to sign on as his co-star.

In August 2018, Berg revealed that the current draft of the script included a story that took place in Alaska with a comedic scene involving walruses, similar to the scene with baboons from the first movie. Acknowledging that Johnson had expressed disinterest in Alaska, Berg stated that a new draft is being written with a less frigid location. Berg said in September 2020 that development for a sequel is ongoing, citing Johnson&#x27;s busy production schedule as one of the reasons it has not yet been made and admitting that they are currently &quot;rethink[ing] the script&quot;.

<text>Hutchison Whampoa Limited (HWL) was an investment holding company based in Hong Kong. It was a Fortune Global 500 company and one of the largest companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. HWL was an international corporation with a diverse array of holdings which included the world&#x27;s biggest port, and telecommunication operations in 14 countries that were run under the [[Hutchison 3G|3]] brand. Its businesses also included retail, property development, and infrastructure. 

In 2015, the company merged with Cheung Kong Group as part of a major reorganisation of the group&#x27;s businesses. The combined business was renamed CK Hutchison Holdings.

==History==
Hutchison Whampoa originated as two separate companies, both founded in the 19th century. Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock was formed in 1863 by John Couper, as a port management company. Hutchison International, a wholesale trading company and importer of consumer products, was founded in 1877 by John Duflon Hutchison.

In 1965, Hutchison International under the leadership of Sir Douglas Clague gained a controlling interest of Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock. He pursued an aggressive path of diversification, acquiring A.S. Watson, Davie, Boag and Co. Ltd., Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Co. Ltd., and China Provident Co. Ltd. A decade later, however, the conglomerate reported losses of HK$130 million and became unable to service its growing debt.

In 1975, Clague lost control of Hutchison Whampoa due to disastrous speculation on foreign currency and stock markets. HSBC refused to bail out the company. HSBC took a 22% stake in the company and replaced Clague. In 1977, Hutchison Whampoa Limited was formed as a result of merger between Hutchison International Limited and Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock Company Limited. A year later Hutchison Whampoa was listed on the stock exchange.

In 1979, Michael Sandberg convinced G. M. Sayer to not hand over a restructured Hutchison Whampoa to another British firm. The bank instead sold off the company on generous terms to Li Ka-shing. On 25 September 1979, at the close of trade in London, HSBC announced that it was selling its 22% stake in Hutchison Whampoa to Cheung Kong Holdings for HK$639 million.

During the 1980s, Hutchison Whampoa bought 33% of Hong Kong Electric Holdings. In 1985, Hutchison Telecommunications, a mobile phone service, was launched, which became a major player in telecommunications in the 1990s. By 2004, Li&#x27;s equity in Hutchison Whampoa had gradually increased to 49.9%.

In March 2011, Hutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPHT) announced that the company would IPO through Singapore Exchange for about US$5.4 billion. This would be the largest offering in South East Asia and surpass Petronas Chemicals&#x27; offering of about $4.1 billion.

In January 2015, Li Ka-shing entered into talks with Telefónica to buy its British mobile division, O2, for around $15.4 billion, but the deal was blocked in 2016 by the EU&#x27;s Competition Commissioner.

In January 2015, Li Ka-shing confirmed plans for Cheung Kong Holdings to purchase the remaining shares in Hutchison Whampoa that it did not already own, and merge the two companies as CK Hutchison Holdings. The merger is part of a larger reorganisation of Li&#x27;s businesses, which will involve the spin-off of property assets into Cheung Kong Property. The new holding company has been incorporated in the Cayman Islands, rather than Hong Kong.

In May 2015, Hutchison revealed plans to sell one-third of its stake in its British-based mobile phone businesses for a potential fee of $4.3 billion to five investors including GIC Private Limited, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, BTG Pactual and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.

==Operations==
HWL operated in 54 countries and employed around 230,000 staff worldwide. The company had six core businesses, most of which transferred to CK Hutchison:

===Ports and related services===
Hutchison Port Holdings (HPH) operates across Europe, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. It operates in five of the seven busiest container ports in the world, handling 13% of the world&#x27;s container traffic. Hutchison Whampoa operates container terminals in Panama, as well as Mexico and other parts of the Americas.

===Property and hotels===
From office buildings in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, to luxury residential properties in the United Kingdom, Hutchison Whampoa Property develops and invests in real estate. Together with Cheung Kong Holdings, HWL has set up a joint-venture company, Harbour Plaza Hotel Management to operate and manage hotels under the portfolio of the Hutchison Property division.

===Retail===
A.S. Watson Group (ASW), HWL&#x27;s retail arm, operates its flagship retail chains in Asia such as Watsons, ParknShop supermarket, TASTE food galleria, GOURMET boutique style fine food hall, GREAT Food Hall, Fortress electrical appliances store, Watson&#x27;s Wine Cellar and Nuance-Watson duty-free operator. In Europe, ASW&#x27;s retail network comprises health and beauty chains: DC, Drogas, Kruidvat, Rossmann, Savers Health &amp; Beauty, Superdrug, , Spektr and Watson&#x27;s, as well as luxury perfumeries and cosmetics retail brands: Marionnaud, ICI Paris XL and The Perfume Shop. A.S. Watson is the world&#x27;s largest health and beauty retailer.

===Infrastructure===
Cheung Kong Infrastructure (CKI), HWL&#x27;s infrastructure arm, is a diversified infrastructure company with businesses in transportation, energy, infrastructure materials, water plants and related operations.

===Energy===
HWL was a major shareholder of Husky Energy, one of Canada&#x27;s largest energy and energy related companies, holding 33.97%.

===Telecommunications===
HWL owned the &quot;3&quot; brand. It also owns 60.4% of Hutchison Asia Telecommunications (HAT), which provides mobile phone networks and data services in Asia. The company&#x27;s subsidiary 3 Group Europe owns its &#x27;3&#x27; branded businesses in Europe. Another 1% of HAT is owned directly by Cheung Kong Holdings, the holding behind Cheung Kong group to which HWL belongs. Additionally, HWL is an official backer of the .mobi top level domain created specifically for the mobile internet and has launched the mobile portal Three.mobi under its &quot;3&quot; brand. Hutchison Whampoa attempted to purchase O2 for £10.25 billion in March 2015, but the European Commission blocked the acquisition in May 2016.

==Criticisms==
Hutchison Whampoa has received criticism from charities such as the Burma Campaign UK and appear on the charity&#x27;s &#x27;dirty list&#x27; for their involvement in trade with the military junta in Burma. They state that the company&#x27;s subsidiary Myanmar International Terminals Thilawa (MITT) is &quot;strategically positioned to facilitate and service Myanmar&#x27;s international trade&quot; and are concerned about the role foreign investment plays in &quot;perpetuating&quot; the country&#x27;s brutal regime.

<text>Recitative (, also known by its Italian name recitativo () is a style of delivery (much used in operas, oratorios, and cantatas) in which a singer is allowed to adopt the rhythms and delivery of ordinary speech. Recitative does not repeat lines as formally composed songs do. It resembles sung ordinary speech more than a formal musical composition.

Recitative can be distinguished on a continuum from more speech-like to more musically sung, with more sustained melodic lines. The mostly syllabic recitativo secco (&quot;dry&quot;, accompanied only by continuo, typically cello and harpsichord) is at one end of the spectrum, through recitativo accompagnato (using orchestra), the more melismatic arioso, and finally the full-blown aria or ensemble, where the pulse is entirely governed by the music. Secco recitatives can be more improvisatory and free for the singer, since the accompaniment is so sparse; in contrast, when recitative is accompanied by orchestra, the singer must perform in a more structured way.

The term &quot;recitative&quot; (or occasionally liturgical recitative) is also applied to the simpler formulas of Gregorian chant, such as the tones used for the epistle, gospel, preface and collects; see accentus.

==Origins==
The first use of recitative in opera was preceded by the monodies of the Florentine Camerata in which Vincenzo Galilei, father of the astronomer Galileo Galilei, played an important role. The elder Galilei, influenced by his correspondence with Girolamo Mei on the writings of the ancient Greeks and with Erycius Puteanus on the writings of Hucbald and wishing to recreate the old manner of storytelling and drama, pioneered the use of a single melodic line to tell the story, accompanied by simple chords from a harpsichord or lute.

In the Baroque era, recitatives were commonly rehearsed on their own by the stage director, the singers frequently supplying their own favourite baggage arias which might be by a different composer (some of Mozart&#x27;s so-called concert arias fall into this category). This division of labour persisted into the 19th century: Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; (1817, recitatives by Luca Agolini) is a famous example. Later it remained a custom to replace originally spoken dialogue with new recitatives: Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; (1821, adapted 1841 with recitatives by Hector Berlioz for the Paris Opera), Georges Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; (1875, recitatives by Ernest Guiraud for the posthumous run in Vienna the same year), Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Mireille&quot; and &quot;La colombe&quot; (staged by Sergei Diaghilev with recitatives respectively by Eric Satie and Francis Poulenc).

== &quot;Secco&quot; ==
&quot;Secco&quot; recitatives, popularized in Florence though the proto-opera music dramas of Jacopo Peri and Giulio Caccini during the late 16th century, formed the substance of Claudio Monteverdi&#x27;s operas during the 17th century, and continued to be used into the 19th century Romantic era by such composers as Gaetano Donizetti, reappearing in Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;. They also influenced areas of music outside opera.

In the early operas and cantatas of the Florentine school, &quot;secco&quot; recitatives were accompanied by a variety of instruments, mostly plucked fretted strings including the chitarrone, often with a pipe organ to provide sustained tone. Later, in the operas of Vivaldi and Händel, the accompaniment was standardised as a harpsichord and a bass viol or violoncello. When the harpsichord was gradually phased out over the late 18th century, and mostly disappeared in the early 19th century, many opera-houses did not replace it with the fortepiano, a hammered-string keyboard invented in 1700.

Instead the violoncello was left to carry on alone, or with reinforcement from a double bass. A 1919 recording of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Barber of Seville&quot;, issued by Italian HMV, gives a unique glimpse of this technique in action, as do cello methods of the period and some scores of Meyerbeer. There are examples of the revival of the harpsichord for this purpose as early as the 1890s (e.g. by Hans Richter for a production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; at the London Royal Opera House, the instrument being supplied by Arnold Dolmetsch), but it was not until the 1950s that the 18th-century method was consistently observed once more. In the 2010s, the early music revival movement has led to the re-introduction of harpsichord in some Baroque performances.

==&quot;Accompagnato&quot; (or &quot;obbligato&quot;)==
Accompanied recitative, known as &quot;accompagnato&quot; or &quot;stromentato&quot;, employs the orchestra as an accompanying body. The composer writes an arrangement for the orchestra musicians. As a result, it is less improvisational and declamatory than &quot;recitativo secco&quot;, and more song-like. This form is often employed where the orchestra can underscore a particularly dramatic text, as in &quot;Thus saith the Lord&quot; from Händel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;; Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were also fond of it. A more inward intensification calls for an arioso; the opening of &quot;Comfort ye&quot; from the same work is a famous example, while the ending of it (&quot;The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness&quot;) is &quot;secco&quot;.

Sometimes a distinction is made between the more dramatic, expressive, or interjecting &#x27;orchestral recitative&#x27; (&quot;recitativo obbligato&quot; or &quot;stromentato&quot;) and a more passive and sustained &#x27;accompanied recitative&#x27; (&quot;recitativo accompagnato&quot;).

==Post-Wagner uses==
Later operas, under the influence of Richard Wagner, favored through-composition, where recitatives, arias, choruses and other elements were seamlessly interwoven into a whole. Many of Wagner&#x27;s operas employ sections which are analogous to accompanied recitative.

Recitative is also occasionally used in musicals, being put to ironic use in the finale of Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. It also appears in &quot;Carousel&quot; and &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;.

George Gershwin used it in his opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, though sometimes the recitative in that work is changed to spoken dialogue. &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; has also been staged as a musical rather than as an opera.

==Instrumental recitative==
Recitative has also sometimes been used to refer to parts of purely instrumental works which resemble vocal recitatives, in terms of their musical style. In an instrumental recitative, one instrument (or group of instruments) are given the melody line (akin to the role of the singer) and another instrument (or group of instruments) are given the accompaniment role. One of the earliest examples is found in the slow movement of Vivaldi&#x27;s violin concerto in D, RV 208, which is marked &quot;Recitative&quot;. C. P. E. Bach included instrumental recitative in his &quot;Prussian&quot; piano sonatas of 1742, composed at Frederick the Great&#x27;s court in Berlin. In 1761, Joseph Haydn took his post at Esterhazy Palace and soon after composed his Symphony No. 7 (&quot;Le Midi&quot;) in concertante style (i.e. with soloists). In the second movement of that work, the violinist is the soloist in an instrumental recitative.

Ludwig van Beethoven used the instrumental recitative in at least three works, including Piano Sonata No. 17 (&quot;The Tempest&quot;), Piano Sonata No. 31, and in the opening section of the Finale of his Ninth Symphony. Here, Beethoven inscribed on the score (in French) &quot;In the manner of a recitative, but &quot;in tempo&quot;.&quot; Leon Plantinga argues that the second movement of Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth Piano Concerto is also an instrumental recitative, although Owen Jander interprets it as a dialogue.

Other Romantic music era composers to employ instrumental recitative include Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (who composed a lyrical, virtuosic recitative for solo violin with harp accompaniment to represent the title character in his orchestral &quot;Scheherazade&quot;) and Hector Berlioz (whose choral symphony &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; contains a trombone recitative as part of its Introduction).

Arnold Schoenberg labeled the last of his &quot;Five Pieces for Orchestra&quot;, Op. 16, as &quot;Das obligate Rezitativ&quot;, and also composed a piece for organ, &quot;Variations on a Recitative&quot;, Op. 40. Other examples of instrumental recitative in twentieth century music include the third movement of Douglas Moore&#x27;s &quot;Quintet for Clarinet and Strings&quot; (1946), the first of Richard Rodney Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Five Impromptus&quot; for guitar (1968), the opening section of the last movement of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;String Quartet No. 3&quot; (1975), and the second of William Bolcom&#x27;s &quot;12 New Etudes for Piano&quot; (1977–86).

== The tropes of recitative ==
There are certain conventions, or &quot;tropes,&quot; which standardize recitative; so that, in practice, recitative is a rigid musical form. The following are standard tropes of recitative:

* Recitative is a dialogue between a (usually) solo voice and an instrument or instruments. Usually the voice and instrument(s) alternate, or share a chord while one continues. In this way the speech-like rhythm of the singer does not need to be coordinated and synchronized with the instrument(s).
* Recitative cadences: The dialog ends with the instruments. Invariably the instrument(s) complete the final dominant-tonic cadence. Also, typically the voice stops on or before the dominant chord and then the instrument(s) execute a return to the tonic. Occasionally the subdominant-tonic (plagal) cadence is used instead.
* Recitative chord progressions: The chord progressions in recitative avoid resolutions and rely heavily on dominant sevenths and diminished chords to postpone the resolution. In the extreme, the instrument(s) start the dialog with a diminished chord, moving from non-resolution to non-resolution, building up to a temporary or final cadence, as described above.
* Trope violations: the transition between recitative and aria, and subtle violations on the above &#x27;tropes&#x27; are what make some recitatives more creative than others. For example, Bach&#x27;s use of a plagal cadence; sometimes more than one voice is used Haydn&#x27;s Creation, 31]; and sometimes a deceptive cadence replaces the dominant-tonic cadence, as a way of appending a new section.

<doc id="284730" wikidata="Q1655773" url="?curid=284730" title="Ibas of Edessa">
<text>Ibas of Edessa (, &quot;Ihiba&quot; or &quot;Hiba&quot;; ) was bishop of Edessa ( – 457) and was born in Syria. His name is the Syriac equivalent of &quot;Donatus&quot;. He is frequently associated with the growth of Nestorianism, although this assertion is contentious and has been opposed.

== Biography ==
=== Presbyter at Edessa ===
He appears first as a presbyter of the church of Edessa during the episcopate of Rabbula, warmly espousing the theological views which his bishop uncompromisingly opposed. He admired the writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia, which he translated into Syriac and diligently disseminated through the East.

The famous theological school of Edessa, of which, according to some accounts, Ibas was head, and to which the Christian youth from Persia and adjacent lands came for education, offered many opportunities for propagating Theodore&#x27;s beliefs. The growing popularity of doctrines which appeared clearly heretical alarmed Rabbula, and he endeavored to get Theodore&#x27;s works anathematized and burnt. However, the church of Edessa was generally favorable to Theodore&#x27;s teaching and supported Ibas against their bishop.

Ibas attended the Council of Ephesus in 431 as a presbyter, was cognizant of the autocratic conduct of Cyril of Alexandria, and wrote in 433 the letter to a man that became known as &quot;Maris, bishop of Hardaschir (or Adashir) in Persia&quot;, a letter which later became one of the Three Chapters. He was probably Mari who was metropolitan of Rev Ardashir around 450. The name might well be a misunderstood appellation formula for the bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, a city known as Adashir during the Sassanid period, which at that point was a certain Catholicos Dadisho (421–456), head of the Church of the East in the Sassanid Empire. &quot;Maris&quot; had been at Edessa previous to the Nestorian controversy, and Ibas wrote to tell him what had occurred since his visit. Though evidently written under great exasperation, it shows Ibas as a man of independent judgment, and free from partisanship. In the letter, Nestorius is severely censured for refusing the title Theotokos to the Virgin Mary, and Ibas accuses Cyril of Apollinarism, and denounces the heresy of his 12 chapters, charging him with maintaining the perfect identity of the manhood and Godhead in Christ, and denying the Catholic doctrine of the union of two Natures in One Person.

=== Election as bishop and accusations ===
When Rabbula died in 435 or 436, Ibas was elected his successor. This was distasteful to those who held the strong anti-Nestorian views of their late bishop, and they speedily planned to secure his deposition, by spreading charges against him of openly preaching heretical doctrines. The accusations soon reached the ears of Emperor Theodosius II and Archbishop Proclus of Constantinople. To Proclus the matter appeared so serious that towards the close of 437, he wrote to John I of Antioch as the leading prelate of the East, begging him to persuade Ibas, if innocent, to remove the scandal by condemning publicly certain propositions chiefly drawn from Theodore&#x27;s writings against the errors of Nestorius. The same demand was made by Proclus of all the Eastern bishops; but Ibas and the other bishops generally refused to condemn Theodore&#x27;s propositions.

Although blocked so far, the malcontents at Edessa continued to work against their bishop. Their leaders were four presbyters, Samuel, Cyrus, Eulogius and Maras, who acted at the instigation of one of Ibas&#x27;s own suffragans, Uranius, bishop of Himeria, a pronounced Eutychian. While Patriarch Domnus II of Antioch, who had in 442 succeeded his uncle John I of Antioch as Patriarch of Antioch, visited Hierapolis Bambyce for the enthronisation of the new bishop Stephen, Ibas&#x27;s opponents chose that moment for action. Cyrus and Eulogius formally laid before Domnus the accusation against Ibas, signed by about 17 clergy of Edessa, and supported by 30. Ibas, starting his journey for Hierapolis Bambyce to pay his respects to Domnus, learned of the accusation, at once summoned his clergy, pronounced excommunication on Cyrus and Eulogius as calumniators, and threatened the same treatment to all who participated in their proceedings.

=== Trials at Antioch and Beirut ===
In 445, Ibas was summoned by Domnus to the synod held at Antioch in the matter of Athanasius of Perrha, but he excused himself by letter. Domnus supported Ibas, and he showed no readiness to entertain the charges brought against him. At last, in Lent 448, the four chief accusers presented their indictment before Domnus and the council of the East in a manner too formal to be neglected. Domnus consequently summoned Ibas to appear before him after Easter to answer the charges. The council was held at Antioch, and was attended by only nine bishops. Ibas in person answered the 18 charges, mostly of a frivolous character and destitute of proof, e.g. that he had appropriated a jewelled chalice to his own use; that the wine at the Eucharist was inferior in quality and quantity; the malversation of sums given for the ransom of captives; simoniacal ordinations and the admission of unfit persons to the ministry and episcopate, especially his nephew Daniel, whom he had made bishop of Harran. The most serious charges were that he had anathematised Cyril and charged him with heresy; that he was a Nestorian; and especially that at Easter 445, in the presence of his clergy, he had spoken the blasphemous words, &quot;I do not envy Christ His becoming God, for I can become God no less than He&quot; and &quot;This is the day that Jesus Christ became God&quot;. The first charge he acknowledged, the others he indignantly repudiated as base slanders. Only two of the accusers appeared. Samuel and Cyrus had gone to Constantinople, in defiance of the terms on which the excommunication had been lifted, to lay their complaint before the emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople, deciding that a hearing by Domnus would obviously be biased towards Ibas. Domnus and the council declined to proceed in the absence of the chief witnesses, and the case seemed to be postponed indefinitely.

Eulogius and Maras then hastened to join their companions in Constantinople, where they found a powerful party strongly hostile to the Eastern bishops, Theodoret in particular. Their faction was soon strengthened by the arrival of Uranius of Himeria, and half a dozen more Edessene clergy. The emperor and Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople, who had succeeded Proclus as archbishop, listened to their complaints but declined to hear them officially. The case was remitted to the East, and by an imperial commission, dated 26 October 448, Uranius of Himeria, Eustathius of Beirut and Photius of Tyre, who was elected 9 September 448, on the deposition of Irenaeus of Tyre, were deputed to hear it, and Damascius, the tribune and secretary of state, was dispatched as imperial commissioner. The whole proceeding was contrary to the canons that bishops should be subjected to the judgment of other bishops, two belonging to another province, on the strength of an imperial decree. No one, however, protested imperial power was regarded as absolute. The tribunal also was grossly unfair. One of the three judges, Uranius of Himeria, was ringleader of the movement against Ibas, while the other two had obtained their sees with his help.

Tyre was named as the place of trial but the hearing was moved to the episcopal residence in Beirut to avoid disturbances. In response to the indictment, Ibas laid before his judges a memorial signed by many of his clergy, denying that he had ever uttered the alleged blasphemies. Only three witnesses supported the accusation and brought forward a copy of the controversial letter to &quot;Maris&quot;. It was later alleged by Ibas&#x27;s enemies during the Second Council of Ephesus and the Council of Chalcedon that Ibas admitted to writing the Letter to Maris and that the minutes of the Council of Beirut were not forged. Justinian I&#x27;s assertion that Ibas had disowned the letter to Maris at Beirut, as having been forged in his name, is disputed by Facundus of Hermiane. Allegations of forgeries of the Council of Beirut&#x27;s minutes lay bare that Ibas either did admit he wrote the letter and then reneged by having partisans falsify the aforementioned minutes or that he denied writing the letter, forcing his accusers to falsify the said minutes in the same section.

In any event, the commissioners, avoiding any judicial decision, brought about a friendly arrangement. His enemies agreed to withdraw their accusations on Ibas&#x27;s promising that he would forget the past, regard his accusers as his children, and remit any fresh difficulty for settlement to Domnus; and that, to avoid suspicion of malversation, the church revenues of Edessa should be administered, like those of Antioch, by &quot;oeconomi&quot;. Ibas gave equal satisfaction on theological points. He engaged to publicly anathematise Nestorius and all who thought with him on his return, and declared the identity of his doctrine with that agreed upon by John and Cyril, and that he accepted the decrees of Ephesus equally with those of Nicaea as due to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The concordat was signed, Uranius alone dissenting, 25 February 449.

=== Deposition at Ephesus ===
The truce was broken within a very few weeks. The Eutychian party was aided by the intrigues of Chrysaphius, Dioscorus of Alexandria and their partisans to obtain an edict summoning a further General Second Council of Ephesus for 1 August 449. Although the council was intended to rehabilitate the reputation of Eutyches, it served as a weapon against Ibas as well. Reports diligently spread in Edessa during his absence of Ibas&#x27;s heterodoxy made his reception so hostile that he was obliged to leave the town and request the Magister militum for a guard to protect him. He soon discovered that all appeal to the civil power was in vain. Chaereas was governor of Osrhoene but had secret instructions from Chrysaphius and Eutyches to arrest and imprison him and reopen the suit. When Chaereas entered Edessa on 12 April 449, to commence the trial, he was met by a mob of abbots and monks and their partisans, clamoring for the immediate expulsion and condemnation of Ibas and his followers. Two days later the inquiry began with Ibas absent and a mob agitating for his condemnation. All Edessa knew that Chaereas had come merely to announce a sentence of condemnation already passed.

Chaereas, however, was moving too slowly for their hatred, and on Sunday, 17 April, the excitement in church was so violent that the count was compelled to promise that the verdict of the synod of Beirut should be reviewed and a new investigation commenced. This began on the next day; all the old charges were reproduced by the same accusers, amid wild yells of &quot;Ibas to the gallows, to the mines, to the circus, to exile&quot; drowning every attempt at explanation or defence. Crucial in the workings of the crowd were monks from monasteries in the city and its vicinity. Chaereas, as had been predetermined, addressed a report to the imperial government, declaring the charges proved; and on 27 June the emperor, acknowledging the receipt of the document, ordered that a bishop who would command the confidence of the faithful should be substituted for Ibas. Only a legally constituted synod could depose him, but meanwhile his enemies&#x27; malice could be gratified by his maltreatment. He was forbidden to enter Edessa, apprehended and treated as the vilest of criminals, dragged about from province to province, changing his quarters 40 times and being in 20 different prisons.

The Second Council of Ephesus opened on 3 August 449. One of its objects was to finally get rid of Ibas, which was the work of the second session, held on 22 August. The three bishops who had conducted the investigation at Tyre and Beirut were asked for an account of their proceedings; they avoided reporting Ibas&#x27;s acquittal, stating that the investigation that was later made at Edessa would be more useful. The monks of Edessa and the other parties to the indictment were admitted and asked for their report, which condemned Ibas as expected. The motion of deposition carried without objection, Eustathius of Beirut and Photius of Tyre, who had previously acquitted him on the same evidence, voting with the majority. Ibas was not called to appear, being then in prison at Antioch. It is not clear what befell Ibas on his deposition.

=== Reinstatement at Chalcedon ===
At the beginning of 451 the bishops who were deposed and banished as a consequence of the Second Council of Ephesus were allowed to return from exile, but the question of their restoration was left for the Council of Chalcedon. At the 9th session, 26 October, the case of Ibas came before the assembled bishops. On his demand to be restored in accordance with the verdict of Photius of Tyre and Eustathius of Beirut, the Acts of that synod (as well as a previous synod in Tyre) were read, and the next day the papal legates gave their opinion that Ibas, was unlawfully deposed, and should be at once restored. After much discussion this was carried unanimously. The legates led the way, declaring &quot;his letter&quot; to be orthodox, and commanded his restitution. All the prelates agreed in this verdict, on the condition that he should anathematize Nestorius and Eutyches and accept the tome of Leo. Ibas consented without hesitation. &quot;He had anathematised Nestorius already in his writings, and would do so again ten thousand times, together with Eutyches and all who teach the One Nature, and would accept all that the council holds as truth&quot;. On this he was unanimously absolved, restored as bishop of Edessa at the subsequent sessions. Nonnus of Edessa, who had been chosen bishop on Ibas&#x27;s deposition, having been legitimately ordained, was allowed to retain his episcopal rank, and on Ibas&#x27;s death, 28 October 457, quietly succeeded him as metropolitan. The acceptance of &quot;his letter&quot;, the Council not being specific which letter was being referred to, would lead to later controversy and allegations that the Council of Chalcedon had approved of the contents of the Letter to Maris.

=== Sixth-century controversy ===
A controversy concerning his letter to &quot;Maris&quot; arose in the next century, in the notorious dispute about the &quot;Three Chapters&quot;, when the letter was branded as heretical (together with the works of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Theodoret&#x27;s writings in favour of Nestorius) in the edict of Justinian, and was formally condemned in 553 by the fifth general council, which pronounced an anathema against all who should pretend that it and the other documents impugned had been recognized as orthodox by the Council of Chalcedon. Later, the Syriac Orthodox Church anathematised Ibas as a Nestorian.

=== Church builder ===
According to the &quot;Chronicle of Edessa&quot;, Ibas erected the new church of the Apostles at Edessa, to which a senator gave a silver table of 720 lb. weight, and consul Anatolius, &quot;Magister militum&quot;, a silver coffer to receive the relics of Thomas the Apostle, who was said, after preaching in Parthia, to have been buried there.

<text>The Fairlight CMI (short for Computer Musical Instrument) is a digital synthesizer, music sampler, and digital audio workstation introduced in 1979 by Fairlight. It was based on a commercial licence of the Qasar M8 developed by Tony Furse of Creative Strategies in Sydney, Australia. It was one of the earliest electronic music workstations with an embedded sampler and is credited for coining the term sampling in music. It rose to prominence in the early 1980s and competed with the Synclavier from New England Digital.

==History==
===: 1971–1979===
In the 1970s, Kim Ryrie, then a teenager, had an idea to develop a build-it-yourself analogue synthesizer, the ETI 4600, for the magazine he founded, &quot;Electronics Today International&quot; (ETI). Ryrie was frustrated by the limited number of sounds that the synthesizer could make. After his classmate, Peter Vogel, graduated from high school and had a brief stint at university in 1975, Ryrie asked Vogel whether he would be interested in making &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest synthesizer&quot; based on the recently announced microprocessor. He recalled: &quot;We had long been interested in computers I built my first computer when I was about 12 and it was obvious to me that combining digital technology with music synthesis was the way to go.&quot;

In December 1975, Ryrie and Vogel formed a home business to manufacture digital synthesizers. They named the business Fairlight after the hydrofoil ferry passing before Ryrie&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s home in Sydney Harbour. The two planned to design a digital synthesizer that could create sounds reminiscent of acoustic instruments (physical modelling synthesis). They initially planned to make an analogue synthesizer that was digitally controlled, as the competing Moog synthesizer was difficult to control.

==== series====
* QASAR M8 (1974/1975) by Tony Furse
: After six months, the pair met the Motorola consultant Tony Furse. In association with the Canberra School of Electronic Music, Furse built a digital synthesizer using two 8-bit Motorola 6800 microprocessors, and the light pen and some of the graphics that would later become part of the Fairlight CMI. However, it was only able to create exact harmonic partials, sounding sterile and inexpressive.
* QASAR M8 CMI (1976–1978) by Kim Ryrie and Peter Vogl
: Vogel and Ryrie licensed Furse&#x27;s design, mainly for its processing power, and decided to use microprocessor technology instead of analogue synthesis. Over the next year, they built what Ryrie called a &quot;research design&quot;, the bulky, expensive, and unmarketable eight-voice QASAR M8 CMI synthesizer, which included a 2×2×4-foot processing box and a keyboard.

====Sampling====
By 1978, Vogel and Ryrie were making &quot;interesting&quot; but unrealistic sounds. Hoping to learn how to synthesize an instrument by studying the harmonics of real instruments, Vogel recorded about a second of a piano piece from a radio broadcast. He discovered that by playing the recording back at different pitches, it sounded much more realistic than a synthesized piano sound. He recalled in 2005:

Vogel and Ryrie coined the term sampling to describe this process. With the Fairlight CMI, they could now produce endless sounds, but control was limited to attack, sustain, decay and vibrato. According to Ryrie, &quot;We regarded using recorded real-life sounds as a compromise as cheating and we didn&#x27;t feel particularly proud of it.&quot; They continued to work on the design while creating office computers for Remington Office Machines, which Ryrie described as &quot;a horrendous exercise, but we sold 120 of them&quot;.

===: 1979–1982===

In addition to the keyboard, processing, computer graphics and interactive pen borrowed from Furse&#x27;s synthesizer, the pair added a QWERTY keyboard, and a large 1×1.5×3-foot box stored the sampling, processing and ADC/DAC hardware and the 8-inch floppy disk. The biggest problem was largely considered to be the small 16 kB sample memory. To accommodate sample lengths from approximately a quarter of a second to an entire second, a low variable sample rate between 24 kHz and 8 kHz was used. The low sample rate introduced aliasing; however, Vogel felt that the low quality of the sounds gave them their own character.

The Music Composition Language feature was criticised as being too difficult for empirical users. Other primitive aspects included its limited amount of RAM (208 kilobytes) and its green-and-black graphics. Nonetheless, the CMI garnered significant attention from Australian distributors and consumers for being able to emulate sounds of acoustic instruments, as well as for its light pen and three-dimensional sound visualisation. Still, Vogel was unsure whether there would be enough interest in the product. The CMI&#x27;s ability to emulate real instruments made some refer to it as an &quot;orchestra-in-a-box&quot;, and each unit came with 8-inch, 500-kilobyte floppy disks that each stored 22 samples of orchestral instruments. The Fairlight CMI also garnered publicity in the science industry, being featured on the BBC science and technology series &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;. The Musicians&#x27; Union described it as a &quot;lethal threat&quot; to its members.

In the summer of 1979, Vogel demonstrated the Fairlight CMI at the home of English singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel, where Gabriel was working on his third solo studio album. Gabriel, as well as many other people in the studio, was instantly engrossed, and he used strange sounds such as breaking glass bottles and bricks on the album. One of those present for the demonstration, Stephen Paine, recalled in 1996: &quot;The idea of recording a sound into solid-state memory and having real-time pitch control over it appeared incredibly exciting. Until that time everything that captured sound had been tape-based. The Fairlight CMI was like a much more reliable and versatile digital Mellotron. Gabriel was completely thrilled, and instantly put the machine to use during the week that Peter Vogel stayed at his house.&quot;

Gabriel was also interested in selling the CMI in the United Kingdom, and he and Paine formed Syco Systems to distribute it for £12,000. The first UK customer was Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, followed by musicians including Boz Burrell, Kate Bush, Geoff Downes, Trevor Horn, Alan Parsons, Richard Wright and Thomas Dolby. The Fairlight CMI was also a commercial success in the United States, used by acts such as Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock, Jan Hammer, Todd Rundgren and Joni Mitchell. Musicians came to realize that the CMI could not match the expressiveness and control that could be achieved using acoustic instruments, and that sampling was better applied as imaginative sound than pure reproduction.

===: 1982–1985===

The second version of the Fairlight CMI, Series II, was released at a price of £30,000 in 1982. The sampler&#x27;s maximum sample rate was increased to 32 kHz, allowing a reduction of aliasing, but only for short samples, as its sample memory was not increased. The bit depth of the sampler also remained 8 bits. The CMI&#x27;s popularity peaked in 1982 following its appearance on a special of the arts magazine series &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; that documented the making of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s fourth self-titled studio album, where he used 64 kilobytes worth of samples of world music instruments and sequenced percussion.

The Fairlight CMI Series II became widely used in popular music recordings of the early to mid-1980s, and its most commonly used presets included an orchestra hit (&quot;ORCH 5&quot;) and a breathy vox (&quot;ARR 1&quot;).

====Page R====
The popularity of Series II was in large part due to a new feature, Page R, their first true music sequencer. As a replacement for the complicated Music Composition Language (MCL) used by Series I, Page R helped the Fairlight CMI Series II become a commercial juggernaut. Page R expanded the CMI&#x27;s audience beyond that of accomplished keyboard players. &quot;Audio Media&quot; magazine described it as an echo of the punk rock era: &quot;Page R also gave rise to a flow of quasi-socialist sounding ideology, that hailed the impending democratisation of music creation, making it available to the musically chops-challenged.&quot; Graphically depicting editable notes horizontally from left to right, the music programming profession and the concepts of quantization and cycling patterns of bars where instrument channels could be added or removed were also born out of the Page R sequencer. CMI user Roger Bolton recalled: &quot;By definition, its sampling limitations and the Page R sequencer forced the composer to make high-quality decisions out of necessity. The CMI II was a high-level composition tool that not only shaped the sound of the 80s, but the way that music was actually written.&quot; Fairlight kept making updates to the system, such as a 1983 upgrade called the CMI Series IIx, which now allowed for MIDI, until the release of Series III in 1985.

===: 1985–1989===

The sampler of the Series III featured many improvements on its predecessors. It was capable of 16-bit sampling, with a maximum sample rate of 44.1 kHz, across 16 channels. This was enabled by the increase in sample memory from 16 kB per channel to 14 MB across all channels, an increase by a factor of 56, even when all channels are in use. Its design, graphics, and editing tools were also improved, such as the addition of a tablet next to the QWERTY keys, using a stylus instead of the on-screen lightpen; this change was made due to complaints from users regarding arm aches from having to hold the pen on the screen.

====CAPS====
An enhanced version of the Page R sequencer called Composer, Arranger, Performer, Sequencer, or CAPS, as well as Eventsync, a post-production utility based on SMPTE timecode linking, were also added to the Series III computer. However, while many people were still using CMIs, sales were starting to diminish significantly due to much lower-cost, MIDI-based sequencers and samplers including the Atari ST and Akai&#x27;s S612, S900 and 1000 samplers appearing on the market. Paine stopped selling the CMI in the United Kingdom because of this. The Fairlight company was becoming more focused on post-production products, a market Paine had a hard time getting used to, and when HHB Communications Ltd took over distribution for the United Kingdom, they failed to sell any.

==Adoption==
Peter Gabriel was the first owner of a Fairlight Series I in the UK. Boz Burrell of Bad Company purchased the second, which Hans Zimmer hired for many recordings during the early part of his career. In the US, Bruce Jackson demonstrated the Series I sampler for a year before selling units to Herbie Hancock and Stevie Wonder in 1980 for US$27,500 each. Meat-packing heir Geordie Hormel bought two for use at The Village Recorder in Los Angeles. Other early adopters included Todd Rundgren, Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran, producer Rhett Lawrence and Ned Liben of Ebn Ozn, the owner of Sundragon Recording Studios who served as the demonstration representative for Fairlight for the U.S. east of the Mississippi.

The first commercially released studio album to incorporate the Fairlight was the third Peter Gabriel album (1980) which includes a credit for Peter Vogel as technician for the &quot;Computer Musical Instrument&quot; (CMI), and was released in May 1980, and also featured Kate Bush. The second album was Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Never for Ever&quot; (September 1980), programmed by Richard James Burgess and John L. Walters.
Wonder took his Fairlight out on tour in 1980 in support of the soundtrack album &quot;Stevie Wonder&#x27;s Journey Through &quot;The Secret Life of Plants&quot;&quot; to replace the Computer Music Melodian sampler he had used on the recording. Geoff Downes used the Fairlight on Yes&#x27; 1980 studio album &quot;Drama&quot; and its subsequent tour. Downes later used the Fairlight on the Buggles&#x27; 1981 studio album &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording&quot;, and both in the studio and live with Asia. Mike Oldfield used the Fairlight CMI extensively on side one of his 1983 studio album &quot;Crises&quot;.
The first classical album using the CMI was produced by Folkways Records in 1980 with composers Barton McLean and Priscilla McLean.

Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1982 studio album also featured the CMI. In 1981, Austrian musicians Hubert Bognermayr and Harald Zuschrader composed a symphony, &quot;Erdenklang – Computerakustische Klangsinfonie&quot;. This work premiered live on stage, using five music computers, during the Ars Electronica festival in Linz. In 1984, he released an album by the singer and songwriter Claudia Robot. (Phonogram) Her studio album &quot;Alarmsignal&quot; consisted of songs written by the female vocalist, with tracks produced by the Fairlight CMI.

The first commercially released single in the US made with a computer, a Fairlight CMI, was Ebn Ozn&#x27;s &quot;AEIOU Sometimes Y&quot; (Elektra 1983) - actually recorded in 1981-1982, along with their studio album &quot;Feeling Cavalier&quot; (Elektra Records 1984).

Devo&#x27;s 1984 studio album &quot;Shout&quot; heavily featured the Fairlight CMI at the expense of analog instruments. Gerald Casale later stated that &quot;Shout&quot; was the biggest regret of his career, &quot;because the Fairlight [synthesizer] just kind of took over everything on that record. I mean, I loved the songwriting and the ideas, but the Fairlight kind of really determined the sound.&quot; Frontman Mark Mothersbaugh later used the CMI in the soundtrack of the 1991 children&#x27;s television show &quot;Rugrats&quot;. The instrument is most prominently heard as the lead instrument in the show&#x27;s theme song – it is the &#x27;Swannee&#x27; sample with a low-pass filter applied.

Australian singer John Farnham used a Fairlight CMI on his twelfth album, &quot;Whispering Jack&quot;, in 1985 and 1986.

==Influence and legacy==
After the success of the Fairlight CMI, other firms introduced sampling. New England Digital modified their Synclavier digital synthesizer to perform sampling, while E-mu Systems introduced a less costly sampling keyboard, the Emulator, in 1981. In the United States, a new sampler company, Ensoniq, introduced the Ensoniq Mirage in 1984 for the price of $1,695, less than a quarter of the price of other samplers.

In America, Joan Gand of Gand Music and Sound in Northfield, Illinois was the top salesperson for Fairlight. The Gand organisation sold CMIs to Prince, James &quot;J.Y.&quot; Young of Styx, John Lawry of Petra, Derek St. Holmes of the Ted Nugent band, Al Jourgensen of Ministry, and many private studio owners and rock personalities. Spokesperson Jan Hammer appeared at several Gand-sponsored Musictech pro audio events, to perform the &quot;Miami Vice Theme&quot;.

The ubiquity of the Fairlight was such that Phil Collins stated on the sleeve notes of his 1985 studio album &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; that &quot;there is no Fairlight on this record&quot; to clarify that he had not used one to synthesize horn and string sounds.

Swedish warez and Commodore demo scene group Fairlight took its name from this device, which Jean-Michel Jarre used on some of his records.

Experimental music group Coil considered the device unique and unsurpassed, describing using the Fairlight as &quot;An aural equivalent of William Burroughs cut-ups&quot;.

In 2005, the Fairlight CMI was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, an honor given to &quot;products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology.&quot; In 2015, the Fairlight CMI was inducted into the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia collection.

In February 2025, an Australian documentary called The birth of electronic music | How the Qasar &amp; Fairlight CMI pioneered computer music technology was released. It uncovered a lot of previously unreported or mis-reported information about the Fairlight CMI.

<text>Emicho was a count in the Rhineland in the late 11th century. He is also commonly referred to as Emicho of Leiningen or Emich of Flonheim, and not to be confused with Bishop Emicho of Leiningen. In 1096, he was the leader of the Rhineland massacres (sometimes referred to as the &quot;German Crusade of 1096&quot;) which were a series of mass murders of Jews that took place during the People&#x27;s Crusade.

== First Crusade ==

The original idea for the First Crusade that had been preached by Pope Urban II at the Council of Clermont in 1095 had already turned into a much different popular movement, the People&#x27;s Crusade, led by Peter the Hermit. Peter&#x27;s preaching of the Crusade spread much more quickly than the official versions of Urban&#x27;s call. Peter&#x27;s version influenced Emicho, who spread his own story that Christ had appeared to him. Infused with the teachings of the Gospel of Luke he felt chosen to fulfill the &quot;end of times&quot; prophecy. Emicho envisioned that he would march on Constantinople and overcome the forces there, taking over the title of &quot;last World Emperor&quot; in accordance with canonical prophetic tradition. All Christian armies, Latin and Greek, would then unite and march to seize Jerusalem from the Saracens thus prompting the Second Coming and denouement with the Antichrist. Inspired by such exulting promises, a few thousand Franks and Germans merged and marched east in April 1096.

=== Followers ===
Emicho&#x27;s army attracted many unusual followers, including a group who worshipped a goose they believed to be filled with the Holy Spirit (see Women in the Crusades). The army included noblemen and knights such as Drogo Count of Nesle, Hartmann I, Count of Dillingen-Kyburg, Thomas, Lord of Marle and La Fère and Count of Amien, and William the Carpenter, Viscount of Milun. This contradicts the often repeated narrative that Emicho&#x27;s army was mostly composed of peasants and burghers who were ignorant and instinctively prejudiced against Jews, mostly for economic reasons. Instead, there were a number of relatively educated and wealthy men, likely accompanied by clerics, in Emicho&#x27;s army who would have known that forced conversions were forbidden according to the tenets of the Church. The violence of the Rhineland massacres cannot be explained away under the assumption that the army was mostly composed of ignorant and provincial peasants.

=== Rhineland massacres ===

Count Emicho&#x27;s precise role in the Rhineland Massacres, the series of violent attacks and forced conversions of the Rhineland&#x27;s Jews just prior to the First Crusade, has been the subject of significant debate. There were many crusading forces moving through the Rhineland, but most were interested primarily in reaching the Holy Land. For instance, when Peter the Hermit and his mob of Crusaders passed through these towns and threatened the Jewish population, they had been amenable to bribes and largely left the Jews free from harassment. Although Emicho has frequently been referenced in secondary and tertiary sources as having been present during the massacres of Jews in Cologne and Worms, there is sparse evidence in the primary accounts to support his involvement. Indeed, the only massacre in which Emicho definitively participated was that in Mainz. The Jewish writer of the account known as the Mainz Anonymous mentions Emicho as having been in the rough vicinity of Speyer during the massacre there, but clearly notes he did not participate in the violence.

Yet Emicho certainly led the forces that massacred the Jews of Mainz, one of the largest European Jewish communities at the time, in May 1096. The Jews within the city were well-aware of the earlier massacres and forced conversions in other Rhineland cities and feared the worst. They appealed to the Archbishop Ruthard and the area&#x27;s lay lords to protect them from the approaching mob, offering money and valuable possessions to further encourage the lords. In an attempt to deter the approaching crusaders, Ruthard closed the city&#x27;s gates and attempted to hide Jews in his palace. Ultimately, however, the city gates were opened by sympathetic burghers within Mainz and the Jews were attacked despite the archbishop&#x27;s best attempts to protect them.

Part of what distinguished Emicho and his army from other crusading armies that crossed the Rhineland was their unwillingness to be swayed from committing violence by bribes. Greed was clearly not their sole motivation, contrary to many cursory accounts of Emicho. While money was likely necessary to fund their pilgrimage to reach the Holy Land, the Crusaders could have easily taken the possessions and money offered to them by the Jews and continued on their way without a significant amount of violence. Yet, they chose to kill the majority of the Jews they encountered, even women and children whom they could have compelled to convert. Emicho and his men went to great lengths to hunt down and kill every refugee they could find in Mainz; they intended to inflict maximal damage. This is exemplified by the Mainz Anonymous&#x27;s description of Emicho:

This ideologically based hatred of Jews, along with the far higher death count, is what made the massacre in Mainz distinct from previous attacks in the Rhineland. The motivations behind this hatred are yet another source of contention by historians. Certain historians have characterized these sentiments as part of the broader context of apocalyptic mythology, with the Crusaders anticipating an imminent end of the world, a &quot;zero-sum game between good and evil”. This end of days would be precipitated by Christian control of the Holy Land and mass conversions of Jews to Christianity. For the end of time to occur, Jews had to either die or abandon Judaism and embrace Christianity. Others see instead this animosity as emerging from the crusade to the Holy Land itself. With the shrines of Christendom being discussed, and the destination being Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre, Christ&#x27;s burial place, the role Jews played in Christ&#x27;s crucifixion must have been in the forefront of many crusaders&#x27; minds. This attitude is illustrated by a crusader&#x27;s supposed remark to a Jew as written by the chronicler Bar-Simson: &quot;You are the children of those who killed the object of our veneration, hanging him on a tree. And he himself had said, &#x27;there will yet come a day when my children will come and avenge my blood.&#x27; We are his children and it is, therefore, our duty to avenge him against you who disbelieve in him.&quot;

Beneath either motivation behind massacring the Rhineland&#x27;s Jews is the reality that Jews in 1096 were alienated from their Christian neighbors. Jews and Muslims were scarcely distinguished in the eleventh century as both were seen as agents of the devil and in league with one another, plotting against Christendom. Thus, it is not surprising that a crusade ostensibly directed against one group could be seamlessly redirected against the other. Especially in the apocalyptic mindset, both Jews and Muslims had to be destroyed or converted for the Earth to reach the end of days.

=== Disintegration of Emicho&#x27;s army ===
The army continued down the Rhine until they reached the Danube, which they followed to Hungary. Here, after having run out of money and food, they began to pillage. Much of the army was killed by the Hungarians; the rest split up to join the other Crusader armies, and Emicho went back home to his family, where he was scorned for not fulfilling his vow to capture Jerusalem.

=== The legend of Emicho ===
Count Emicho was said to be influenced into action by a divine vision. In the vision an apostle is giving Emicho a crown in &quot;Italian Greece&quot; and promising him &quot;victory over his foes&quot;. This vision is a grave reference to the &quot;Last Roman Emperor&quot;, which is the legend of a man surrendering his &quot;earthly power to God&quot; and being given the power to destroy the enemies of Christians, mercilessly. In the legend the purpose of the &quot;Last Roman Emperor&quot; is to restore God&#x27;s power in the Holy Land. To restore God&#x27;s power the chosen one, the one granted the vision, is expected to kill or convert those who oppose Christianity. By having such a divine vision, those who knew of Count Emicho and believed in his vision interpreted him as the main leader of the Rhineland Massacres.

Chroniclers, such as Ekkehard, saw Count Emicho&#x27;s vision as his rebirth. Ekkehard was a monk of Aura who later joined a Crusading army in 1100. Ekkehard, in his account, noted Count Emicho as a person who was once tyrannical, but was &quot;called by a divine revelation, like another Saul&quot;. Nevertheless, in medieval political thought, Saul was a complex character that was often employed in discussions of the nature of lay authority, and its derivation from the Church. In short, medieval churchmen often evoked Saul&#x27;s contest with Samuel – and used Samuel to support their position that lay authority was dependant on legitimacy granted by the Church, rather than the other way around. Considering Ekkehard&#x27;s support for the reform movement, and his position regarding the Investiture Controversy, a comparison to Saul may not be an entirely positive one.

The account of Albert of Aachen places Count Emicho as the main leader of the Rhineland Massacre by using diction such as &quot;Emicho and the rest of his band&quot;. Emicho&#x27;s vision played an important role to his ability to be a leader during the Rhineland Massacre. He was qualified to lead the crusading army because his vision was interpreted as God placing him in the role of power. Even after his death, there were accounts stating the myth that Emicho&#x27;s soul was guarding the gate of Rhineland.

Count Emicho has been viewed as both a person who took part in the Rhineland Massacres as a soldier as well as the person who is directly responsible for the actions committed in the Rhineland. His documented involvement in the massacres could be attributed to the legend of the Last Roman Emperor.

<doc id="284741" wikidata="Q16211322" url="?curid=284741" title="Pemmican Proclamation">
<text>In January 1814, Governor Miles MacDonell, appointed by Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk issued to the inhabitants of the Red River area a proclamation which became known as the Pemmican Proclamation. The proclamation was issued in attempt to stop the Métis people from exporting pemmican out of the Red River district. Cuthbert Grant, leader of the Métis, disregarded MacDonell&#x27;s proclamation and continued the exportation of pemmican to the North West Company. The proclamation overall, became one of many areas of conflict between the Métis and the Red River settlers. Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk had sought interest in the Red River District, with the help of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company as early as 1807. However, it was not until 1810 that the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company asked Lord Selkirk for his plans on settling in the interior of Canada.

The Red River Colony or the Selkirk Settlement included portions of present-day southern Manitoba, northern Minnesota and eastern North Dakota, in addition to small parts of eastern Saskatchewan, northwestern Ontario and northeastern South Dakota.
==Synopsis==
The Proclamation defined the borders of the lands ceded to Lord Selkirk by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company over which Miles MacDonell had been appointed Governor.

The proclamation next outlined the reasons and the means by which the governor would control the flow of food, mostly pemmican from the area.

==Sources==
The Proclamation was submitted as evidence during the Pemmican War Trials held in Montreal in 1818. and published in the: Report of trials in the courts of Canada, relative to the destruction of the Earl of Selkirk&#x27;s settlement on the Red River With observations (p. 61-62) by Amos Andrew in 1820.

==The Proclamation==

== Background ==
“In order to expand their food supply, fur companies traded large quantities of dried bison meat and fat in fall and early winter to produce at their posts blocks of pemmican (pronounced “pimigan” in the Cree), a word meaning “he makes grease.” An energy-rich, cheap food source, pemmican consisted of pounded dried meat, soft fat (unsaturated fats derived from bone marrow) and hard fat (saturated fats taken from body fat and converted into tallow), bosses (fatty hump meat), and/or dépouille (strips of fat that lay along the spine of the animal). Although Indians produced some pemmican and traded it directly to European posts, more commonly, British commerce came to depend on pemmican mass-produced by Europeans at their own posts.”

Pemmican became the main source of food throughout the Bison trade nearing the end of the eighteenth century. The Hudson’s Bay Company relied on the food to provide a source of energy for their fur-traders who had relocated to areas that had a scarce food supply but plenty of fur. By the mid-1790s the first systems of small wintering posts had become massive food depots, with Montreal companies organizing depots in the Red River Valley. The Hudson’s Bay Company grew concerned during the turn of the century because their rival, the North West Company, was providing trappers in the north with enough Pemmican to allow them to specialize their hunting patterns to cater to the English trading posts rather than the HBC.

“ The impact of the European factory system on traditional pemmican production has yet to be fully studied, especially at carryover places and between watersheds where large communities of indigenous people gathered. Indeed, it became so commonplace for woodland hunters to visit and even inhabit trade routes and major transshipment points where they might gain access to the plains-trade pemmican stockpiled there that the HBC eventually outlawed its crews from making such exchanges and sternly rebuked traders who made it available around their posts.”

The early nineteenth century saw competition increase between food trading companies in and around the Red River settlement. This led to a steep increase in Pemmican prices, which would become a problem in 1811 when winter conditions became extremely harsh. By 1813, companies instructed their traders to offer Native hunters “extraordinary payment” for hunting beyond their specific provisions.

“Competition over the trade, poor winters, and hunters burning the plains escalated prices and, in the end, contributed to one of Rupert’s Land’s more chaotic turns in 1814 with the advent of the “Pemmican Wars”—where the Selkirk settlers, under the Pemmican Proclamation, attempted to regulate and control pemmican production by rival companies.21 This very issue sparked the bloody Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816: Métis clashed with settlers who had earlier seized and now competed for the high-priced food supplies of the NWC coming from the Assiniboine River.”

A major contributor to the controversy surrounding the Red River Settlement was the purchasing of Hudson’s Bay Company shares by Thomas Douglas, the 5th Lord of Selkirk. Douglas, in an attempt to provide new opportunities for Scottish settlers, purchased enough shares from the HBC to be granted a large land settlement in the Red River. Conflict arose from the situation because not only was Douglas granted a massive chunk of the Red River Settlement but he did not want trade to profit the rival North West Company, which led to the Lord of Selkirk cutting off the Metis inhabiting  the Red River colony and interfering with NWC trade routes. The harsh living conditions and scarcity of food would eventually lead to Douglas’ reliance on the Metis and the introduction of the Pemmican Proclamation, considering the ties he had severed with those he now depended on in the area.

The Proclamation was submitted as evidence during the Pemmican War Trials held in Montreal in 1818. and published in the: Report of trials in the courts of Canada, relative to the destruction of the Earl of Selkirk&#x27;s settlement on the Red River With observations (p. 61-62) by Amos Andrew in 1820.

== Pemmican Trade ==
For the settlers living near the Red River on the edge of the prairie, the Pemmican Trade was an important source of trade for the Red River Valley, almost comparable to what the beaver-pelt trade did for the Natives farther north. This trade was a major factor in the emergence of a distinct Métis society. Pemmican was made of dried buffalo meat pounded into a powder and mixed with melted buffalo fat in leather bags. Packs of pemmican would be shipped north and stored at the major fur posts. Ultimately, the Pemmican trade began to establish its position within the Red River and other parts of the prairies, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), and North West Company (NWC).

To procure pemmican in sufficient quantities, the HBC and NWC traded for it at several outposts in the Red River District and shipped it to their Bas de la Rivière depot on Lake Winnipeg where it was distributed to brigades of north canoes passing between Fort William and Athabasca or transported to Fort William where it was issued to brigades going to the company&#x27;s eastern and southern districts. The majority of the NWC&#x27;s pemmican was purchased from the local Métis and to a lesser degree from the local First Nations people and freemen. The pemmican, which forms the staple article of produce from the summer hunt, is a species of food peculiar to Rupert&#x27;s Land. It is composed of buffalo meat, dried and pounded fine, and mixed with an amount of tallow or buffalo fat equal to itself in bulk. The tallow having been boiled, is poured hot from the caldron into an oblongbag, manufactured from the buffalo hide, into which the pounded meat has previously been placed. The contents are then stirred together until they have been thoroughly well mixed. When full, the bag is sewed up and laid in store. Each bag when full weighs one hundred pounds. It is calculated that, on an average, the carcass of each buffalo will yield enough pemmican to fill one bag

Ultimately, the pemmican trade was a major factor for the expanding provisions that were being streamlined and developed within the Red River Area, as well as Winnipeg and other parts of the Prairies located between Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The two Major trading companies which were the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and North-West Company began establishing various territories and boundaries where they could exercise the Pemmican trade. Both the HBC and the NWC needed to establish their trade routes in the area to secure the economic benefits of Pemmican. Therefore, the need to establish a trade route led to conflict between the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the North West Company that erupted in 1812.

&quot;In 1812, the Hudson’s Bay Company established the Selkirk agricultural colony on the banks of the Red River. This posed a strategic threat to the North West Company since the colony lay astride its provision supply line in that quarter. The seriousness of the danger was manifest in the winter of 1814. The colony was seriously short of provisions.&quot;

The need for the North West Company and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to establish a suitable route of transportation for the Pemmican trade would be vital in securing economic prosperity. The Red River was beginning to see an increase in settlements and trading posts erecting in the area, as the Red River served as a vital mode of transportation. The NWC had previously built a strong relationship with the Metis, and ultimately the NWC positioned themselves as defenders of the Natives and Métis, and thus became opponents of the HBC colonization scheme that would illegally dispossess the native peoples. Furthermore, it was vital for these companies to secure an alliance when trading Pemmican because the native expertise in buffalo hunting would serve as the most productive way obtaining Pemmican ingredients. Also, since there had been a food shortage in these areas since 1776, Pemmican became a prominent source of food in the Red River settlements. Pemmican would be an important food source during the winter months and would serve as an offset or back-up to inconsistent crop-growth within settlements. With the food shortage however came an increase in the price and trade of Pemmican.

&quot;In such circumstances, Indian suppliers drove up prices on provisions offered to Europeans. While volumes increased to meet European demands by the turn of the century, so did the traded value, or price, of these commodities, especially in areas hard hit by changing game conditions. In 1801 intense local competition between traders raised prices overall. Lower Red River outfits, by then supplying massive amounts of food to the trading companies, priced depot pemmican at an astronomical shilling per pound—in better circumstances, Europeans could get it for a quarter or less than that&quot;.

The increased price of Pemmican, combined with the food shortage and tensions between the settlement of HBC and NWC territories ultimately developed into conflict. Tensions erupted in the end, which contributed to one of Rupert&#x27;s Land more chaotic turns in 1814 with “The Pemmican Proclamation,” which attempted to regulate and control pemmican production by rival companies. This very issue sparked the bloody Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816, which saw the Métis clash with settlers who had earlier seized and now competed for the high-priced food supplies of the NWC coming from the Assiniboine River.

== Impact of the Pemmican Proclamation (The Pemmican War) ==
The Pemmican Proclamation was a key factor in the onslaught of the Pemmican War that took place from 1812-1821. During the Pemmican War, the Métis suffered immensely and had a tough time legally hunting for food. Carolyn Podruchny, author of the book &quot;Contours of People: Metis Family, Mobility and History&quot; notes the Metis struggled to during the Pemmican War to survive stating “ the Winter of 1814-15 was a difficult one as the Metis buffalo hunters were increasingly hostile to the colony”.

One of the many issues which arose during the Pemmican Proclamation was the Battle of Seven Oaks. The Pemmican War worsened the relationship of white European settlers in Canada and the Metis. Lyle Dick, author of the article “The Seven Oaks Incident and the Construction of a Historical  Tradition, 1860-1970”, notes the Seven Oaks Incident of 1816 was a direct result of the Pemmican War. Dick further suggest the Pemmican War played a minor role in motivating the Red River Rebellion of 1870. The Seven Oaks Incident occurred on June 1816, as a violent clash took place between a group of Hudson Bay Company Officers and Selkirk Settlers vs. a party of Metis traders from the Red River and the Upper Assiniboine.

Currently in Canada, there is a large debate to as who instigated the Seven Oaks Incident. Lyle Dick notes that reportedly, the first shot was fired by the Metis, however Contemporary Commissioner William Bachelor Coltman was sent by lower Canada (which is Now Quebec) to investigate the dispute between HBC/Selkirk settlers and the Metis, and came to a different conclusion. Commissioner Coltman stated the first shot was fired by the HBC/ Selkirk Settlers, and the Metis most likely reacted in self defense. The aftermath of the confrontation between the two groups left The HBC/ Selkirk Settlers with 21 deaths and one survivor, whereas the Metis only had one man killed. Robert Semple, Governor of Assiniboia was killed in the gunfire. Which group fired the first shot is still a debated subject among scholars, however Lyle Dick notes it has been dubbed “The Seven Oaks Massacre” by scholar of the time period George Bryce in 1870. The notion the Battle of Seven Oaks was a massacre was a new “master narrative” of Western progress in 1870, which depicts Metis as savage villains, and white European settlers as the unanimous hero or victim.

The Pemmican Proclamation was a main reason the Battle of Seven Oaks to take place and is one of many confrontations between the Metis and white settler Europeans. The Pemmican Proclamation also led to European&#x27;s control of the pemmican market in the 1820s. The price of pemmican during the Pemmican War was kept low until small amounts of buffalo or meat could be found, when pemmican prices would grow causing many issues for Metis. George Coltpitts, author of the article “ Market Economies in the British Buffalo Commons in the Early Nineteenth Century”, notes these changes stating “In the earlier provisions trade, local Indian hunters clearly controlled the hunt and the price of provisions on the market. Indians demanded ever-higher prices from British traders for their products, including dried meats, fats, and pemmican. But with the amalgamation of British fur trade companies in 1821, almost all plains hunters inhabiting the large territories of the Blackfoot Nations (Kainai, Siksika, and Piikani), the Atsina (Gros Ventre), the Assiniboine-Nakota, and the Plains Cree lost bargaining power to a consolidated and systematic provisions buyer.

By the 1830s, pemmican cost the equivalent of 2 pence per pound (d/lb), a price at least four times lower than it had been three decades earlier. Prices remained remarkably low across vast stretches of the British North American territories and stayed that way until the depleted herds could no longer feed the thousands of indigenous people and newcomers dependent upon them. Occasionally, regional game depletion or bad hunting weather limited the supply of raw materials needed to make pemmican; short supply tipped the market advantage to the Indians, who raised prices to meet increasing demand for their products. But by the late 1820s, HBC managers developed a standing order system and a region-wide buying strategy that stabilized the market and significantly undermined Indian bargaining power. The HBC in turn enjoyed an enviable advantage as a consumer of pemmican; it progressively enlarged its purchases and use of this cheapened energy source”. The Pemmican Proclamation caused many issues for the Metis and aboriginal population of Canada for many years after its legislation was passed.

During the late 1790s and heading into the turn of the century, pemmican became a leading source of food throughout the fur trading monopolies. This transition to pemmican began because it was a source of energy that could be stored and preserved for long periods of time, which allowed fur traders to venture beyond designated areas to find game because of this new unspoiled food. From first establishing small food systems to organizing massive food depots, companies began to realize that they could heavily profit from an entirely European run production of pemmican. A major step towards this transition to a European system was the involvement of Thomas Douglas, 5th Lord of Selkirk. Douglas had a strong desire to relocate poor Scottish immigrants to profitable land settlements. The Red River and the pemmican industry would have been perfect for the Lord of Selkirk and his colonizers because Douglas had used his fortune to purchase enough HBC shares to be granted land in the Red River Settlement. This meant the Lord of Selkirk&#x27;s men (he promised 200 annually to the HBC) could take over the pemmican production, stop the Metis from supplying the NWC, and interrupt fur trades routes of rival company trappers. He did not plan for the extreme weather conditions and scarcity of food because of said conditions that would come in the years of 1811-1813. This would lead to the settlers’ dependence on the Metis for survival and the Pemmican Proclamation that would ban the export of pemmican from the Red River Settlement to avoid starvation. This would be the beginnings of the Pemmican War that would ensue shortly after.

<text>CSIRAC (; &quot;Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Automatic Computer&quot;), originally known as CSIR Mk 1, was Australia&#x27;s first digital computer, and the fifth stored program computer in the world. It is the oldest surviving first-generation electronic computer
(the Zuse Z4 at the Deutsches Museum is older, but was electro-mechanical, not electronic), and was the first in the world to play digital music.

After being exhibited at Melbourne Museum for many years, it was relocated to Scienceworks in 2018 and is now on permanent display in the Think Ahead gallery.
A comprehensive source of information about the CSIRA collection, its contributors and related topics is available from Museums Victoria on their Collections website.

==History==
The CSIRAC was constructed by a team led by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard, working in large part independently of similar efforts across Europe and the United States, and ran its first test program (multiplication of numbers) sometime in November 1949. In restricted operation from late 1950, publicly demonstrated and operational in 1951.

==Design==
The machine was fairly representative of first-generation valve-driven computer designs. It used mercury acoustic delay lines as its primary data storage, with a typical capacity of 768 20-bit words, supplemented by a parallel disk-type device with a total 4096-word capacity and an access time of 10 milliseconds. Its memory clock ran at 1000 Hz, and the control unit, synchronized to the clock, took two cycles to execute an instruction (later the speed was doubled to one cycle per instruction). The bus (termed the &quot;digit trunk&quot; in their design) is unusual compared to most computers in that it was serial—it transferred one bit at a time.

Most of CSIRAC&#x27;s approximately 2000 valves were of the types 6SN7, 6V6, EA50 diodes and KT66. George Semkiw later redesigned the drum-read electronics to use germanium transistors.

Input to the machine was performed in the form of punched wide, 12-track paper tape, after experiments with punch cards proved unsatisfactory. The machine was controlled through a console which allowed programs to be stepped through one instruction at a time, and featured CRT displays which showed the contents of registers. Output was through a standard teleprinter or to punch tape.

The instruction set supported the basic set of arithmetic and logical operations, as well as conditional and relative jumps (making it possible to write a library of subroutines). Instructions consisted of three components: a 5-bit &quot;destination&quot; P1-P5, a 5-bit &quot;source&quot; P6-P10, and a 10-bit &quot;address&quot; P11-P20. For instructions that used the main store, the six bits P15-P20 selected one of the 64 logical delay lines. Bits P11-P14 determined the time at which 20 bits of data were written to or extracted from the delay line, and thus represented address of a word within the selected delay line. There were 32 destination gates and 32 source gates; the 10 address bits identified a data word within the store if either the source or destination required access to the store. The total number of source and destination combinations, or different instruction functions, was 1024, although only about 256 of these were used often. The machine had three 20-bit registers (A, B and C), two of which were involved in multiplication, one 10-bit register which could link to either half of a word, and a group of 16 20-bit registers, addressed via bits P11-P14. In addition the 20-bit program counter (S register), and the instruction register (K) were accessible.

The machine, like all machines of the era, had no operating system. A high-level interpreted programming language called INTERPROGRAM was developed in 1960 by Geoff Hill. It was similar to early forms of BASIC, which was designed in 1963 for the 20-bit transistorized GE-200 series.

In 1950 CSIRAC was used to play music, the first known use of a digital computer for the purpose. The music was never recorded, but it has been accurately reconstructed.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc.net.au/radionational/sum-of-all-parts/13.1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, with the CSIRO&#x27;s decision that computing research was outside its purview, the machine was transferred from its home at the Radiophysics Laboratory at the CSIRO in Sydney, to the University of Melbourne, where it formed Australia&#x27;s only academic computing facility until late 1956. Many pioneers of computer use in Australia had their first exposure to computing there.

==Preservation==
In 1964, CSIRAC was shut down for the last time. Its historical significance was already recognised at that stage, and it was placed in storage with plans for its later exhibition in a museum.

The machine was stored in a warehouse through the 1960s and 1970s, before being set up for exhibit at Caulfield Institute of Technology (later the Caulfield Campus of Chisholm Institute of Technology, and later again the Caulfield Campus of Monash University) from 1980 to 1992. It was then returned to storage.

Interest in the machine was revived in the 1990s, as it was realised that many of its developers were ageing and history was being lost forever. A conference about the machine was held in 1996.
The machine found a permanent home with Museums Victoria in 2000. It has not been operable since its shutdown, but many of the programs that ran on it have been preserved, and an emulator has been written for it. The curators have decided that, aside from the cost of restoring the device, the huge number of repairs that would be required to make it safe to operate (CSIRAC used 30 kilowatts of power in operation) would detract from its historical authenticity.

After being exhibited at Melbourne Museum for many years, it was relocated to Scienceworks in 2018 and is now on permanent display in the Think Ahead gallery.

CSIRAC is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and is included in a Heritage Overlay.

It is listed as a National Engineering Landmark by Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

<text>Norrbotten (), known in English as North Bothnia, is a Swedish province (&quot;landskap&quot;) in northernmost Sweden. It borders south to Västerbotten, west to Swedish Lapland, and east to Finland.

== Administration ==
The traditional provinces of Sweden serve no administrative or political purposes, but are historical and cultural entities. In this case, however, the county is older than the province. When the new national border to the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland formed, the province of Västerbotten split in two, and formed the municipalities of Kolari, Muonio, Pello, Tornio, and Ylitornio. However, Finnish Västerbotten is not recognized enough as its own historical province, so it&#x27;s usually merged instead with Ostrobothnia, however leaving out Muonio to Laponia. The northernmost of the counties of Sweden were created in 1810 consisting of the northern parts of Lappland and Västerbotten. After that, northern Västerbotten has gradually evolved as a province of its own.

== Heraldry ==
Not being one of the old historical provinces of Sweden Norrbotten had not been granted a coat of arms in the same way as the others. As recently as 1995, after decades of controversy, Norrbotten got its arms, thus recognized as a real province.

== History ==

During the Middle Ages, the area was sparsely populated by Sami people, who lived on hunting, fishing and reindeer herding. Although swedish people have lived near the coast as early as 1335 as documented in the testament of Svenalde from Rutvik. From the Middle Ages and forward, the Swedish kings tried hard to colonise and Christianize the area. Settlers from the then eastern half of Sweden, Finland – the most important of which were known as Birkarls ~ controlled the trade and even the taxing on the area long into the 16th century. From the mid-16th century, the area was more firmly tied to Sweden. An important sign of Swedish control was the large Nederluleå stone church from 1492. Still today, Finnish and Sami minorities live in Norrbotten and they have kept their culture and language.

Historically, Västerbotten was the denomination for northern Sweden, together with the Lappland areas. The &quot;Eastern Botten&quot; or Ostrobothnia was in the Finnish side.

Cultural identification in Sweden is closely related to the historical provinces, and the people in Norrbotten live in this sense in Northern Västerbotten, or &quot;Norra Västerbotten&quot;. In order not to be confused with people from Southern Västerbotten, i.e. the coastal region of Västerbotten County, they started to identify themselves with the county rather than with the historical province.

Norrbotten had gradually become synonymous with the area that was previously referred to as northern Västerbotten. It started to evolve as a separate province. During the 20th century it got all of the symbols (animals, flowers etc.) which are assigned to the other provinces of Sweden. But there was still some resistance to the idea of Norrbotten being a province.

As recently as 1995, after decades of debate, Norrbotten was granted a coat of arms, thus at last being fully recognized as one of provinces of Sweden.

The coat of arms symbolizes the four large rivers in Norrbotten that drain into the Gulf of Bothnia: Torne River, Kalix River, Lule River and Pite River.

The summers can bring surprisingly warm temperatures for such northerly latitudes, and Norrbotten holds the all-time high temperature record for the entire Norrland at 37 °C (98 °F).

== Population ==
As of 31 December 2016, the population is 195,024, distributed over 26,671 km2, which gives a density of 7.3 inhabitants/km2.

== Culture ==
Norrbotten has around 8,000 ancient remains. Languages spoken in the province include Swedish (including North Swedish regiolects), Meänkieli, Finnish, and Sami. Some Meänkieli speakers have gradually been considering themselves part of the Kven people, which supposedly arrived to the area much earlier than the Swedish settlers.

The Church Village of Gammelstad outside Luleå has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Gammelstad revolves around a medieval church and has 404 smaller church cabins. The cabins were used as a resting place for people living too far away to travel back and forth the same day.

== Sports ==
Football in the province (and Norrbotten County as a whole) is administered by Norrbottens Fotbollförbund. Ice hockey is also popular, with Luleå HF, and basketball with the BC Luleå men&#x27;s team and the Luleå BBK women&#x27;s team.
