<doc id="273646" wikidata="Q87610" url="?curid=273646" title="Empress Michiko">
<text>is a member of the Imperial House of Japan. She was Empress of Japan as the wife of Akihito, the 125th Emperor of Japan reigning from 7 January 1989 to 30 April 2019.

Michiko married Crown Prince Akihito and became Crown Princess of Japan in 1959. She was the first commoner to marry into the Japanese imperial family. She has three children with her husband: Naruhito, Fumihito, and Sayako. Her elder son, Naruhito, is the current emperor. As crown princess and later as empress consort, she has become the most visible and widely travelled imperial consort in Japanese history. Upon Akihito&#x27;s abdication, Michiko received the new title of , or Empress Emerita.

==Early life and education==
Michiko Shōda was born on 20 October 1934 at the University of Tokyo Hospital in Bunkyō, Tokyo, the second of four children born to , president and later honorary chairman of Nisshin Flour Milling Company, and his wife, . Raised in Tokyo and in a cultured family, she grew up receiving a careful education, both traditional and European, learning to speak English and to play piano and being initiated into the arts such as painting, cooking and kōdō. She has an older brother Iwao, a younger brother Osamu, and a younger sister Emiko. She is the niece of several academics, including Kenjirō Shōda, a mathematician who was the president of the University of Osaka from 1954 until 1960. 

Shōda attended Futaba Elementary School in Kōjimachi, a neighbourhood in Chiyoda, Tokyo, but was required to leave in her fourth-grade year because of the American bombings during World War II. She was then successively educated in the prefectures of Kanagawa (in the town of Katase, now part of the city of Fujisawa), Gunma (in Tatebayashi, the home town of the Shōda family), and Nagano (in the town of Karuizawa, where Shōda had a second resort home). She returned to Tokyo in 1946 and completed her elementary education in Futaba and then attended the Sacred Heart School for Junior High School and High School in Minato, Tokyo. She graduated from high school in 1953.

In 1957, Shōda graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; from the Faculty of Literature at the University of the Sacred Heart (a Catholic university in Tokyo) with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature.

Since she came from a particularly wealthy family, her parents were very selective about her suitors. There had been several contenders for her hand in marriage in the 1950s. Biographers of the writer Yukio Mishima, including Henry Scott Stokes, report that Mishima had considered marrying Michiko Shōda, and that he was introduced to her for that purpose sometime in the 1950s.

==Engagement and marriage==
In August 1957, she met then-Crown Prince Akihito on a tennis court at Karuizawa near Nagano. The Imperial Household Council formally approved the engagement of the Crown Prince to Michiko Shōda on 27 November 1958. At that time, the media presented their encounter as a real &quot;fairy tale&quot;, or the &quot;romance of the tennis court&quot;. The engagement ceremony took place on 14 January 1959.

The future Crown Princess was the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, but she was still a commoner. During the 1950s, the media and most persons familiar with the Japanese monarchy had assumed that the powerful Imperial Household Agency would select a bride for the Crown Prince from the daughters of the former court nobility, or from one of the former branches of the Imperial Family. Some traditionalists opposed the engagement, as Shōda came from a Catholic family, and although she was never baptized, she was educated at Catholic institutions and seemed to share the faith of her parents. It was also widely rumoured that Empress Kōjun had opposed the engagement. After the death of Empress Kōjun in 2000, Reuters announced that she had been one of the strongest opponents of the marriage and that, in the 1960s, she had driven her daughter-in-law to depression by persistently accusing her of not being suitable for her son. Death threats alerted the authorities to ensure the security of the Shōda family. Yukio Mishima, known for his traditionalist position, said at the time: &quot;The imperial system becomes &#x27;tabloidesque&#x27; in its move toward democratization. It&#x27;s all wrong—the idea (of the Imperial Family) losing its dignity by connecting with the people.&quot;
However, the young couple had by then gained wide public support. That support also came from the ruling political class. Additionally, everyone showed affection for the young &quot;Mitchy&quot; who had become the symbol of Japan&#x27;s modernization and democratization (the media at the time hinted at the phenomenon of a &quot;Mitchy boom&quot;). The wedding finally took place as a traditional Shinto ceremony on 10 April 1959. The wedding procession was followed in the streets of Tokyo by more than 500,000 people spread over an 8.8 km route, while parts of the wedding were televised, thus making it the first imperial wedding to be made available for public viewership in Japan, drawing about 15 million viewers. In accordance with tradition, Shōda received a personal emblem (): the white birch of Japan () upon admission to the imperial family.

==Crown Princess==

The young couple then moved to , or &quot;East Palace&quot;, the traditional name of the official residence of the crown prince installed since 1952, located within the grounds of the Akasaka Estate in Motoakasaka, Minato, Tokyo. They left Tōgū Palace after her husband acceded to the throne in 1989.

The couple have three children (two sons and a daughter):
# 
# , following her marriage to urban designer Yoshiki Kuroda on 15 November 2005, Princess Nori gave up her imperial title and left the Imperial Family as required by 1947 Imperial Household Law, took the surname of her husband and became known as .

In 1963, the Associated Press reported that the Crown Princess, then about three months pregnant, underwent an abortion on 22 March, in Tokyo. As the article stated, &quot;The operation was advised by her physician, Prof. Takashi Kobayashi, who delivered Michiko&#x27;s first child, three-year-old Prince Hiro, a spokesman said. The spokesman said it is believed the 28-year-old princess&#x27; health has been impaired by a continuous round of official and social functions before pregnancy&quot;.

Contrary to the tradition that the children of the imperial family should be separated from their parents and placed with private tutors, Crown Prince Akihito and his wife Crown Princess Michiko again broke precedent from the start by preferring to raise their children instead of entrusting them to the care of court chamberlains; the Crown Princess even breastfed. She and her husband have also built up a strong position among the general public, by their frequent trips in the 47 prefectures in the country to meet people but also for the liberties taken by the imperial couple vis-a-vis the protocol. At a more formal level, the Crown Prince and Princess visited 37 foreign countries between 1959 and 1989.

== Empress of Japan ==

Upon the death of Emperor Shōwa on 7 January 1989, Crown Princess Michiko&#x27;s husband became the 125th Emperor of Japan, and she became empress consort. The new Emperor and Empress were enthroned (&quot;Sokui Rei Seiden no Gi&quot;) at the Tokyo Imperial Palace on 12 November 1990.

Since their enthronement and until her husband&#x27;s abdication, the imperial couple visited many countries, and did much to make the Imperial Family more visible and approachable in contemporary Japan. They also tried to be close to the people, visiting the 47 prefectures of Japan.

Her official duties, apart from visits to other countries, were to assist her husband at events and ceremonies, both within and outside the Imperial Palace, receiving official guests including state guests and also to visit the social, cultural and charitable institutions and facilities. For example, in 2007, Michiko performed duties in her official capacity on more than 300 occasions. For many years Akihito and Michiko visited facilities for children on Children&#x27;s Day and facilities for the elderly on Respect for the Aged Day. Beginning in 2014 they passed on these duties to the younger generation though it was announced by the Imperial Household Agency that their health had no bearing on this decision. Following the death of her mother-in-law, Empress Dowager Nagako, on 16 June 2000, she succeeded her as honorary president of the Japanese Red Cross Society.
As empress, she was particularly responsible for &quot;Momijiyama Imperial Cocoonery&quot;, a sericulture farm on the grounds of the imperial palace. She participated in the annual ceremony of harvesting silk, personally fed silkworms with mulberry leaves and was responsible for taking care of them, the frames, and the harvesting. The production and harvesting of silk were part of her ceremonial duties, linked to Shintoism, Japanese culture, and tradition. From 1994 to 2019, the Empress offered a part of the harvested silk of the &quot;koishimaru&quot; variety (the oldest species now kept in Japan) to the Shōsōin Treasure-house in the Buddhist temple Tōdai-ji in Nara to be used for the restoration of its treasures.

The Empress of Japan is expected to be the embodiment of traditional values such as modesty and purity. Michiko demonstrated a strong sense of duty throughout her life, which made her quite popular amongst the Japanese. She took part in religious ceremonies with her husband, such as visits to Ise Grand Shrine, other Shinto shrines and Imperial mausoleums to pray to the Imperial Family&#x27;s ancestral spirits. In addition, she is an accomplished classical pianist.

The Empress was elevated into the Hall of Fame of International Best Dressed List in 1990.

On the abdication of her husband on 30 April 2019, she became the Empress Emerita. Since the abdication, the couple&#x27;s primary residence has been the Takanawa Residence. In August 2023, Michiko and Akihito visited the tennis court where they first met and interacted with members of the organization responsible for its upkeep.

==Hobbies, passions and literary works==

The Empress Emerita particularly enjoys reading, music and plays the piano and harp. Moreover, the imperial family has been known for several decades to form, occasionally, a family piano trio, with Crown Prince Akihito playing the cello, Crown Princess Michiko playing the piano, and Prince Naruhito playing the violin. Empress Michiko is also known to be particularly keen on gagaku, a kind of traditional Japanese court music.

She is also a fan of poetry, including the works of Michio Mado that she has selected, compiled and translated several of his poems in a series of collections under the titles &quot;Dobutsu-tachi&quot; (Animals) in 1992 and &quot;Fushigi na Poketto&quot; (The Magic Pocket) in 1998.

She has composed several poems, including waka. Some of them have been published: a series of compound waka by Akihito and Michiko, Crown Prince and Princess, were published in 1987 and then republished in 1991 under the title &quot;Tomoshibi: Light&quot;. Finally, a collection of 367 waka by the Empress was published in 1997 under the title , and 53 of them have been translated into French and published in France by &quot;Signatura&quot; under the title &quot;Sé-oto, song of the ford&quot;.

In 1991, she wrote a children&#x27;s book, illustrated by Wako Takeda: &quot;Hajimete no Yamanobori&quot; (&quot;My First Mountain Climb&quot;).

She is a hibernophile with an interest in &quot;Children of Lir&quot;, recites &quot;I See His Blood Upon The Rose&quot; by Joseph Plunkett as a party piece, and even speaks passable Irish.

==Health==
Michiko suffered from several nervous breakdowns because of the pressure of the media and, according to Reuters, the attitude of her mother-in-law, Empress Nagako, that had resulted in particular in making her lose her voice for seven months in the 1960s. She briefly collapsed at the Akasaka Palace on her birthday in 1993 and did not speak for two months, a condition caused by &quot;deep sadness&quot; and attributed by her doctors to negative media coverage. 

Empress Michiko had to cancel many of her official duties in the spring of 2007, while suffering from mouth ulcers, nosebleeds and intestinal bleeding due to psychological stress, according to her doctors. This would be similar to the situation of her daughter-in-law, Masako, who also underwent several episodes of depression due to the pressures of her position.

In June 2019, it was announced that Michiko had heart valve abnormalities and an irregular pulse, though she was reported to be well enough to undergo cataract operations. In August 2019, it was revealed that she was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer a month prior while undergoing a routine medical appointment, and was scheduled to have the growth removed. In September 2019, it was reported by &quot;The Japan Times&quot; that the surgery was successful. On her 86th birthday in October 2020, it was revealed that she had been suffering from a mild fever since May. She was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in August 2022 following the discovery of a clot in her right calf.

On 3 June 2024, Michiko tested positive for COVID-19 but recovered after a week. 

On 7 October 2024, she underwent surgery after breaking her femur during a fall at the Sentō Imperial Palace of the Akasaka Estate in Tokyo. The following day, 8 October, it was announced the surgery was successful and that she would remain in hospital until the following Tuesday.

==Issue==
Michiko and Akihito have three children (two sons and a daughter).

<text>The prime minister of the Hellenic Republic (), usually referred to as the prime minister of Greece (), is the head of government of the Hellenic Republic and the leader of the Greek Cabinet.

The officeholder&#x27;s official seat (but not residence) is the Maximos Mansion in the centre of Athens. After the Presidency of the Government () was established, the office is referred to either as Prime Minister or President of the Government ().

== Election and appointment of the prime minister ==
The prime minister is officially appointed by the president of Greece.

According to Article 37 of the Greek Constitution, the president of the Hellenic Republic shall appoint the leader of the political party with the absolute majority of seats in the parliament as prime minister. If no party has the absolute majority, the president shall give the leader of the party with a relative majority (plurality) an exploratory mandate in order to ascertain the possibility of forming a government enjoying the confidence of parliament.

If this possibility cannot be ascertained, the president shall give the exploratory mandate to the leader of the second largest party in Parliament, and if this proves to be unsuccessful, to the leader of the third largest party in parliament. Each exploratory mandate shall be in force for three days.

If all exploratory mandates prove to be unsuccessful, the president summons all party leaders, and if the impossibility to form a cabinet enjoying the confidence of the parliament is confirmed, the president shall attempt to form a cabinet composed of all parties in parliament for the purpose of holding parliamentary elections. If this fails, the president shall entrust the president of the Supreme Administrative Court or of the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court or of the Court of Auditors to form a cabinet as widely accepted as possible to carry out elections after the president dissolves Parliament.

Therefore, the election of members of a certain party to parliament is the equivalent to a vote for that party&#x27;s leader for prime minister.

== Oath of office ==
=== Religious oath of office ===
Before taking office, the prime minister is sworn in at a religious ceremony inside the Presidential Mansion. Prime ministers are sworn in by the archbishop of Athens who is the head of the Church of Greece. The archbishop begins with a few prayers and the Kyrie Eleison, and then the prime minister-elect places his hand on the Bible placed in between two lit candles, all on a table between him and the archbishop. Following after the archbishop, the prime minister-elect then recites the oath:

The archbishop then recites a few more blessings, and the participants make the sign of the cross three times. The archbishop then congratulates the new prime minister, who then shakes hands with the president before the pertinent documents are signed.

=== Civil oath of office ===
In 2015 Alexis Tsipras, a self-proclaimed atheist, became the first prime minister to opt for a secular instead of the traditional religious oath. He was sworn in by President Karolos Papoulias instead of the archbishop of Athens, and, in place of the above oath, recited the affirmation:
He then shook hands with the president, who congratulated him, before proceeding to sign the official documents as normal.

When Tsipras assumed the premiership again, on 21 September 2015, President Prokopis Pavlopoulos decided that the affirmation had to be more formal, as it follows:

== Official seat of the prime minister ==
The Maximos Mansion (Greek: Μέγαρο Μαξίμου) has been the official seat of the prime minister of Greece since 1982. It is located in central Athens, near Syntagma Square. Although the building contains the offices of the head of the Greek Government, it is not used as the residence of the prime minister.

== History of the office ==

=== During the revolution (1821–1832) ===
During the Greek War of Independence, different regions of Greece that were free of Ottoman control began establishing democratic systems for self-government, such as the Peloponnesian Senate. Meanwhile, a series of overarching National Assemblies, such as the First National Assembly at Epidaurus, met from time to time to provide overall coordination. The First Assembly elected a 5-member executive council, which was headed by Alexandros Mavrokordatos.

The Executive continued to govern Greece until 1828, when Ioannis Kapodistrias assumed the governance of the state as &quot;Governor of Greece&quot;—simultaneously head of state and of the government. Kapodistrias was assassinated in 1831 and his government, presided over by his brother Augustinos, collapsed the following year. It was replaced by a series of collective governmental councils, which lasted until 1833, when Greece became a monarchy.

=== Under Otto&#x27;s absolute monarchy (1832–1843) ===
In 1832, Greece&#x27;s nascent experiment with democracy was ended and a monarchy was established with the underage Bavarian Prince Otto as king. Initially, the government was led by a regency council made up of Bavarians. The president of this council, Count Josef Ludwig von Armansperg was the &quot;de facto&quot; head of government under Otto. Later Otto dismissed his Bavarian advisers and wielded power as an absolute monarch, effectively as head of state and his own head of government.

=== Constitutional monarchy (1843–1862) ===

King Otto&#x27;s reign as an absolute monarch ended when agitators for a constitution (as promised when the monarchy was established) rose in the 3 September Revolution in 1843. Otto was forced to grant a constitution and Andreas Metaxas took power; he is credited with being the first Greek to formally serve as &quot;Prime Minister.&quot;

Once the office of prime minister was established, the responsibility for self-government again fell to the Greek people. However, two factors maintained significant power for the crown: the Greek party structure was weak and client-based, and the monarch was free to select any member of parliament to form a government.

===Crowned Republic (1863–1910) ===

In 1862, Otto was deposed and the Greek people chose a new monarch in the person of King George I of Greece. In the next 15 years, the party structures began to evolve into more modern ideological parties with the Nationalist Party led by Alexandros Koumoundouros on the right and the more liberal New Party led by Charilaos Trikoupis. Trikoupis was successful after the election of 1874 in forcing the king to accept the &quot;dedilomeni principle&quot; ()--that the leader of the majority in parliament must be selected as prime minister by the king.

The Nationalists were later led by Theodoros Deligiannis who famously said &quot;was against everything Trikoupis was for.&quot; This two-party system existed until 1910, even as Georgios Theotokis took over the New Party after the death of Trikoupis in 1895 and the assassination of Deligiannis in 1905, which led to a splintering of parties on the conservative and nationalist side.

=== Upheaval, revolts and war (1910–1949) ===

In 1910, military officers sparked the fall of civilian government when they issued the Goudi Pronunciamento. This event led to the arrival in Greece of the Cretan politician Eleftherios Venizelos. His followers gathered in the Liberal Party, which, despite Venizelos&#x27; dominant status, constituted the first true party in the modern sense, in that it was formed around a progressive, liberal and pro-republican political agenda.

The Liberal Party was eventually opposed by the more conservative and pro-royalist People&#x27;s Party, initially led by Dimitrios Gounaris. The antagonism between the two parties, and the supporters of monarchy and republicanism, would dominate the political landscape until after the Second World War.

===Stabilization and conflict with the monarchy (1950-1967)===

The Constitution of 1952 brought stability in the 1950s since the political institutions of Greece had been significantly weakened by the Metaxas&#x27; dictatorship (1936-1941), followed by the devastation of Axis occupation of Greece (1941-1945) and by the Greek civil war (1946-1949). However, the king maintained considerable powers, such as dissolving the government and parliament and calling new elections. Moreover, article 31 stated that the king hires and fires ministers (). This created confusion as the prime minister was chosen by popular election, but the elected prime minister could not select the government&#x27;s ministers without the king&#x27;s approval. Two prime ministers in the 1950s had raised the question as to who governs the state, the king or the prime minister, echoing the disagreements between Eleftherios Venizelos and Constantine I during the National Schism.

Georgios Papandreou and his political party, Center Union, having a moderate reformist platform, gained considerable traction and rose to power in elections of 1963 and later in elections of 1964. However, seeds of resentment towards Papandreou from the military grew as they were excluded from salary increases. He also made a faint attempt to gain control of the military, which alarmed many officers without weakening them. The latter created friction with the King Constantine II, who wanted to be in command of the army and not the elected government. In the meantime, the son of Georgios Papandreou, Andreas Papandreou, who had joined Greek politics after 23 years in the United States as a prominent academic, was campaigning by having fierce anti-monarchy and anti-American rhetoric, destabilizing the fragile political equilibrium. Andreas Papandreou&#x27;s militant and uncompromising stance made him a target of conspiratorial accusations from ultra-rightists who feared that following any new elections, which the nearly 80-year-old Georgios Papandreou would likely win, his son would be the actual focus of power in the party. These incidents caused a dispute between Georgios Papandreou and King Constantine II, leading to the resignation of the former. The king, potentially acting within his constitutional rights but politically dubious approach, tried to bring members of the Center Union party to his side and form a government, leading to Apostasia of 1965. To end the political deadlock, Georgios Papandreou attempted a more moderate approach with the king, but Andreas Papandreou publicly rejected his father&#x27;s effort and attacked the whole establishment, attracting the support of 41 members of the Center Union in an effort designed to gain the party&#x27;s leadership and preventing any compromise. The prolonged political instability between the politicians and the king in finding a solution led a group of Colonels to intervene and rule Greece for seven years.

===Greek Junta (1967-1974)===

===Third Hellenic Republic (1975-)===

With the return of civilian rule under Constantine Karamanlis, the new government, acting under extraordinary circumstances, issued a &quot;Constituting Act&quot; which voided the 1973 constitution. Pending a referendum on a new constitution, the 1952 constitution was temporarily restored, &quot;except for the articles dealing with the form of the State&quot;; the last phrase referred to whether the monarchy would be restored or not. In the meantime, the functions of the king were to be discharged by the incumbent President of the Republic General Phaedon Gizikis who was appointed by the Ioannides&#x27; short-lived regime as a nominal figurehead. 

The matter was settled by plebiscite on 8 December 1974, by which the monarchy was definitively abolished. A new Constitution, adopted by Parliament and promulgated on 11 June 1975, established a parliamentary democracy with a president as head of state. Karamanlis reinforced the executive branch&#x27;s power, represented by the prime minister, while the president would act as the head of state with sufficient reserve powers, the right to call elections, appoint a government, dissolve Parliament, and call referendums on important national questions. Moreover, the president could veto any legislation that did not reflect the popular will that could only be overcome with three fifth parliamentary majority. The presidential powers, which overall exceeded those of the monarch under the 1952 Constitution, were drawn inspiration from the recent Gaullism reforms in the France where Karamanlis spent time (1963-1974).

Papandreou triggered a constitutional crisis to revise the constitution in 1985 to increase the powers of the prime minister by removing the reserve powers of the president, which were acting as checks and balances; effectively turning the prime minister into a &quot;parliamentarian autocrat.&quot; Greek constitutional reformers commonly include in their proposals the return of some prerogatives taken back to the president to reduce majoritarian politics, i.e., &#x27;winner takes all,&#x27; while avoiding conflicts between the president and prime minister in the executive branch.

The Constitution was amended again in 2001, 2008, and 2019 and is in force today.

<text>The president of the Republic of Lithuania () is the head of state of the Republic of Lithuania. The president directs and appoints the executive branch of the Government of Lithuania, represents the nation internationally and is the commander-in-chief of the Lithuanian Armed Forces. The president is directly elected by the citizens of Lithuania for a five-year term, with the office holder limited to serving two terms consecutively. The current president is Gitanas Nausėda who assumed office on July 12, 2019.

==Eligibility==
To be eligible for election, candidates must be at least 40 years old on the election day and reside in Lithuania for at least three years, in addition to satisfying the eligibility criteria for a member of the parliament. A person who has been removed from office through impeachment for breach of constitution or an oath of office may not be elected as a president.

==Powers==
The Lithuanian president has somewhat more executive authority than their counterparts in neighboring Estonia and Latvia; the Lithuanian president&#x27;s function is very similar to that of the presidents of France and Romania. Similarly to them, but unlike presidents in a fully presidential system such as the United States, the Lithuanian president generally has the most authority in foreign affairs. In addition to the customary diplomatic powers of Heads of State, namely receiving the letters of credence of foreign ambassadors and signing treaties, the president determines Lithuania&#x27;s basic foreign policy guidelines. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the Lithuanian Armed Forces, and accordingly heads the State Defense Council and has the right to appoint the Chief of Defence (subject to Seimas consent).

The president also has a significant role in domestic policy, possessing the right to submit bills to the Seimas and to veto laws passed by it, appointing the prime minister and approving the government formed by them, and also having the right to dissolve the Seimas and call snap elections following a successful motion of no confidence or if the Seimas refuses to approve the government&#x27;s budget within sixty days. However, the next elected Seimas may retaliate by calling for an earlier presidential election.

Finally, the president ensures an effective judiciary, being responsible for nominating one third of the judges of the Constitutional Court, and the entirety of the Supreme Court, for appointment by the Seimas; the president also has the right to directly appoint all other judges.

==Election==
Under the Constitution of Lithuania adopted in 1992, the president is elected to a five-year term under a modified two-round system: a candidate requires an absolute majority of the vote and either voter turnout to be above 50% or for their vote share to be equivalent to at least one-third of the number of registered voters to win the election in the first round. If no candidate does so, the two candidates with the most votes face each other in a second round held two weeks later. Upon taking office, the president must suspend any formal membership in a political party.

If the president dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, the Speaker of the Seimas assumes the office until a new president can be inaugurated following fresh elections.

<doc id="273659" wikidata="Q839139" url="?curid=273659" title="President of Romania">
<text>The president of Romania () is the head of state of Romania. They are directly elected by a two-round system, and, following a modification to the Romanian Constitution in 2003, serve for five years. An individual may serve two terms that may be consecutive. During their term in office, the president may not be a formal member of a political party. The president of Romania is the supreme commander of the Romanian Armed Forces.

The office of president was created in 1974 when communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu elevated the presidency of the State Council to a fully fledged executive presidency. It took its current form in stages after the Romanian Revolution, culminating in adopting Romania&#x27;s current constitution in 1991.

Ilie Bolojan has served as acting president since 12 February 2025, when Klaus Iohannis resigned.

== Communist era ==

In the Communist era, the president was elected for a five-year term by the Great National Assembly (GNA) on the recommendation of the Romanian Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee and the Front of Socialist Unity and Democracy, with no term limits. Ceaușescu was the only holder of the office under this system; he was elected by the GNA in 1974 and reelected in 1980 and 1985, each time unopposed. The president continued to serve as &quot;ex officio&quot; president of the State Council and had the right to act on any matter that did not require a State Council plenum. He also appointed and dismissed ministers and heads of central agencies. When the GNA was not in session (in practice, for most of the year), the president could appoint and dismiss the president of the Supreme Court and the prosecutor general without the State Council&#x27;s approval; indeed, he was not even required to consult his State Council colleagues when making such decisions. Ceaușescu created the office to make himself the chief decision-maker in both name and fact. Previously, he had nominally been first among equals on the State Council, deriving his real power from his leadership of the Communist Party. In practice, he used his power to act on all matters that did not require a plenum to rule by decree. Over time, he also usurped many powers that constitutionally belonged to the State Council as a whole.

== Oath of office ==

After the Constitutional Court acknowledges the legality of the election, the Houses of Parliament meet in a joint session. The elected President takes the following oath of office, specified by article 82 of the Constitution:

&quot;I solemnly swear that I will dedicate all my strength and the best of my ability to the spiritual and material welfare of the Romanian people, to abide by the Constitution and laws of the country, to defend democracy, the fundamental rights and freedoms of my fellow-citizens, Romania&#x27;s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity. So help me God!&quot;

== Powers and duties ==

Under the 1991 Constitution, which was amended in 2003, presidential powers were curtailed in contrast to communist Romania; the office continues to wield significant influence within a semi-presidential system of government.

The president&#x27;s duties are set out in Title III, Chapter II of the Constitution. These are not exclusive, and are supplemented by other constitutional and legal provisions.

In home affairs:
* Embodies the state and safeguards its independence, unity and territorial integrity.
* Guards the observance of the Constitution and the functioning of public authorities.
* Designates and appoints the Prime Minister, subject to parliamentary approval (the President cannot dismiss the Prime Minister).
* Appoints and removes ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister (a proposal by the Prime Minister may be rejected only once; in such cases, the Prime Minister cannot re-submit the same nomination for ministerial office; the President cannot refuse the appointment of a second, different, nominee).
* Consult the Government on major policy matters.
* Chairs Government when matters of national interest about foreign policy, the defence of the country or public order are debated and, at the Prime Minister&#x27;s request, in other instances as well.
* Addresses Parliament on issues of national interest.
* Assents to bills (the President may ask Parliament to reconsider a bill only once).
* Refers bills for review to the Constitutional Court before signifying his assent. 
* Summons Parliament after a legislative election.
* Requests extraordinary sessions of Parliament.
* Dissolves Parliament (The President may dissolve Parliament if no vote of confidence has been obtained to form a government within 60 days after the first request was made and only after the rejection of at least two Prime Ministerial candidates).
* Calls referendums (after consultation with Parliament). Such referendums are advisory, and Parliament may choose not to implement their result. However, if a referendum is valid (this requires a majority vote in favour and above 30 percent turnout), Parliament may not legislate contrary to the referendum result.

In foreign affairs:
* Undertakes state, official and working visits overseas. 
* Concludes international treaties negotiated by the Government and submits them to Parliament for ratification.
* Appoints and recalls ambassadors and diplomatic envoys on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (following such advice is not mandatory).
* Receives letters of credence from foreign diplomatic envoys.
* Approves the setting up, closing down, or change in rank of diplomatic missions.

In defence issues:
* Exerts the role of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.
* Presides over the Supreme Council of National Defence.
* Declares mobilisation of the Armed Forces, subject to prior approval from Parliament (or, in special circumstances, subsequent approval).
* Acts to repel armed aggression towards the country.
* Institutes the state of siege or the state of emergency (nationally or locally, with subsequent parliamentary approval).

Other duties:
* Confers decorations and titles of honour.
* Makes appointments to senior military ranks. 
* Makes appointments to public offices as provided by law.
* Grants individual pardons.

In the exercise of his functions, the president issues decrees. Decrees issued under Article 91 (1) and (2), Article 92 (2) and (3), Article 93 (1), and Article 94 a), b) and d) of the Constitution must be countersigned by the Prime Minister to take effect.

== Impeachment ==

An incumbent president who severely violates the Constitution may be suspended by the Parliament in a joint session. If the suspension motion passes, there is a call for a referendum of impeachment within no more than 30 days of the suspension.

If the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, in joint session, accuse the president of high treason, the president is suspended from powers and duties by right. The accusations are judged by the High Court of Cassation and Justice. The incumbent president is dismissed by right if found guilty of high treason.

=== History ===

The suspension and impeachment procedure has been implemented three times. The first time regarded President Ion Iliescu, following a statement regarding the returning of the illegally confiscated properties during the years of the Socialist Republic of Romania to the original owners or their heirs. This first attempt in 1995 did not pass the vote in Parliament.

The second attempt was successful, with the person suspended being Traian Băsescu, in office as of April 2007. He became the first president to successfully be suspended and also the first to face an impeachment vote before the people regarding issues with supposed unconstitutional acts. The impeachment plebiscite was held on 19 May 2007, and Băsescu survived the impeachment attempt. The result was the rejection of the proposal by 24.94% in favor to 75.06% opposed.

The third attempt led to a second successful suspension in July 2012, again against Traian Băsescu. The referendum was held on 29 July 2012, and the results were 88.7% in favor and 11.3% opposed, with voter turnout calculated to be 46.24%, below the 50% + one vote threshold required at the time the referendum was held. The Constitutional Court did not give a verdict on the validation of the referendum at the time, citing irregularities in the permanent electoral lists. On 21 August, the Court deemed the referendum invalid, and again, Băsescu prevailed from being ousted.

The fourth attempt culminated with Klaus Iohannis resignation as President of Romania in order to &quot;not create a divided Romania&quot;.

== Succession ==

Should the office of the president become vacant due to resignation, impeachment, permanent inability to perform the duties of office, or death while in office, the president of the Senate or the president of the Chamber of Deputies, in that order, step in as &quot;Ad Interim President of Romania&quot; (). Neither relinquishes their position as president of their respective Legislative House for the duration of the ad interim term. An ad interim president cannot address the Parliament, dissolve the Parliament, nor call for a referendum (the impeachment referendum after a motion of suspension is called by Parliament). The vacancy of the office cannot be longer than three months. While the president is suspended, the office is not considered vacant.

<doc id="273665" wikidata="Q131709" url="?curid=273665" title="Little egret">
<text>The little egret (Egretta garzetta) is a species of small heron in the family Ardeidae. It is a white bird with a slender black beak, long black legs and, in the western race, yellow feet. As an aquatic bird, it feeds in shallow water and on land, consuming a variety of small creatures. It breeds colonially, often with other species of water birds, making a platform nest of sticks in a tree, bush or reed bed. A clutch of three to five bluish-green eggs is laid and incubated by both parents for about three weeks. The young fledge at about six weeks of age.

Its breeding distribution is in wetlands in warm temperate to tropical parts of Asia, Africa, Australia, and Europe. A successful colonist, its range has gradually expanded north, with stable and self-sustaining populations now present in the United Kingdom.

In warmer locations, most birds are permanent residents; northern populations, including many European birds, migrate to Africa and southern Asia to over-winter there. The birds may also wander north in late summer after the breeding season, and their tendency to disperse may have assisted in the recent expansion of the bird&#x27;s range. At one time common in Western Europe, it was hunted extensively in the 19th century to provide plumes for the decoration of hats and became locally extinct in northwestern Europe and scarce in the south. Around 1950, conservation laws were introduced in southern Europe to protect the species and their numbers began to increase. By the beginning of the 21st century the bird was breeding again in France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Britain. Its range is continuing to expand westward, and the species has begun to colonise the New World; it was first seen in Barbados in 1954 and first bred there in 1994. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the bird&#x27;s global conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The little egret was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Ardea garzetta&quot;. It is now placed with 12 other species in the genus &quot;Egretta&quot; that was introduced in 1817 by the German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster with the little egret as the type species. The genus name comes from the Provençal French &quot;Aigrette&quot;, &quot;egret&quot;, a diminutive of &quot;Aigron&quot;, &quot;heron&quot;. The species epithet &quot;garzetta&quot; is from the Italian name for this bird, &quot;garzetta&quot; or &quot;sgarzetta&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;E. g. garzetta&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – nominate, found in Europe, Africa, and most of Asia except the south-east
* &quot;E. g. nigripes&quot; (Temminck, 1840) – found in the Sunda Islands, Australia and New Zealand

Three other egret taxa have at times been classified as subspecies of the little egret in the past but are now regarded as two separate species. These are the western reef heron &quot;Egretta gularis&quot; which occurs on the coastline of West Africa (&quot;Egretta gularis gularis&quot;) and from the Red Sea to India (&quot;Egretta gularis schistacea&quot;), and the dimorphic egret (&quot;Egretta dimorpha&quot;), found in East Africa, Madagascar, the Comoros and the Aldabra Islands.

==Description==

The adult little egret is long with an wingspan, and weighs . Its plumage is normally entirely white, although there are dark forms with largely bluish-grey plumage. In the breeding season, the adult has two long plumes on the nape that form a crest. These plumes are about and are pointed and very narrow. There are similar feathers on the breast, but the barbs are more widely spread. There are also several elongated scapular feathers that have long loose barbs and may be long. During the winter the plumage is similar but the scapulars are shorter and more normal in appearance. The bill is long and slender and it and the lores are black. There is an area of greenish-grey bare skin at the base of the lower mandible and around the eye which has a yellow iris. The legs are black and the feet yellow. Juveniles are similar to non-breeding adults but have greenish-black legs and duller yellow feet, and may have a certain proportion of greyish or brownish feathers. The subspecies &quot;nigripes&quot; differs in having yellow skin between the bill and eye, and blackish feet. During the height of courtship, the lores turn red and the feet of the yellow-footed races turn red.
Little egrets are mostly silent but make various croaking and bubbling calls at their breeding colonies and produce a harsh alarm call when disturbed. To the human ear, the sounds are indistinguishable from the black-crowned night heron (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;) and the cattle egret (&quot;Bubulcus ibis&quot;) with which it sometimes associates.

==Distribution and habitat==
The breeding range of the western race (&quot;E. g. garzetta&quot;) includes southern Europe, the Middle East, much of Africa and southern Asia. Northern European populations are migratory, mostly travelling to Africa although some remain in southern Europe, while some Asian populations migrate to the Philippines. The eastern race, (&quot;E. g. nigripes&quot;), is resident in Indonesia and New Guinea, while &quot;E. g. immaculata&quot; inhabits Australia and New Zealand, but does not breed in the latter. During the late twentieth century, the range of the little egret expanded northwards in Europe and into the New World, where a breeding population was established on Barbados in 1994. The birds have since spread elsewhere in the Caribbean region and on the Atlantic coast of the United States.

The little egret&#x27;s habitat varies widely, and includes the shores of lakes, rivers, canals, ponds, lagoons, marshes and flooded land, the bird preferring open locations to dense cover. On the coast it inhabits mangrove areas, swamps, mudflats, sandy beaches and reefs. Rice fields are an important habitat in Italy, and coastal and mangrove areas are important in Africa. The bird often moves about among cattle or other hoofed mammals.

==Behaviour==
Little egrets are sociable birds and are often seen in small flocks. Nevertheless, individual birds do not tolerate others coming too close to their chosen feeding site, though this depends on the abundance of prey.

===Food and feeding===
They use a variety of methods to procure their food; they stalk their prey in shallow water, often running with raised wings or shuffling their feet to disturb small fish, or may stand still and wait to ambush prey. They make use of opportunities provided by cormorants disturbing fish or humans attracting fish by throwing bread into water. On land they walk or run while chasing their prey, feed on creatures disturbed by grazing livestock and ticks on the livestock, and even scavenge. Their diet is mainly fish, but amphibians, small reptiles, mammals and birds are also eaten, as well as crustaceans, molluscs, insects, spiders and worms.
===Breeding===
Little egrets nest in colonies, often with other wading birds. On the coasts of western India these colonies may be in urban areas, and associated birds include cattle egrets (&quot;Bubulcus ibis&quot;), black-crowned night herons (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;) and black-headed ibises (&quot;Threskiornis melanocephalus&quot;). In Europe, associated species may be squacco herons (&quot;Ardeola ralloides&quot;), cattle egrets, black-crowned night herons and glossy ibises (&quot;Plegadis falcinellus&quot;). The nests are usually platforms of sticks built in trees or shrubs, or in reed beds or bamboo groves. In some locations such as the Cape Verde Islands, the birds nest on cliffs. Pairs defend a small breeding territory, usually extending around from the nest. The three to five eggs are incubated by both adults for 21 to 25 days before hatching. They are oval in shape and have a pale, non-glossy, blue-green shell colour. The young birds are covered in white down feathers, are cared for by both parents and fledge after 40 to 45 days.
==Conservation==
Globally, the little egret is not listed as a threatened species and has in fact expanded its range over the last few decades. The International Union for Conservation of Nature states that their wide distribution and large total population means that they are a species that cause them &quot;least concern&quot;.

===Status in northwestern Europe===
Historical research has shown that the little egret was once present, and probably common, in Ireland and Great Britain, but became extinct there through a combination of over-hunting in the late medieval period and climate change at the start of the Little Ice Age. The inclusion of 1,000 egrets (among numerous other birds) in the banquet to celebrate the enthronement of George Neville as Archbishop of York at Cawood Castle in 1465 indicates the presence of a sizable population in northern England at the time, and they are also listed in the coronation feast of King Henry VI in 1429. They had become scarce by the mid-16th century, when William Gowreley, &quot;yeoman purveyor to the Kinges mowthe&quot;, &quot;had to send further south&quot; for egrets. In 1804 Thomas Bewick commented that if it were the same bird as listed in Neville&#x27;s bill of fare &quot;No wonder this species has become nearly extinct in this country!&quot;

Further declines occurred throughout Europe as the plumes of the little egret and other egrets were in demand for decorating hats. They had been used in the plume trade since at least the 17th century but in the 19th century it became a major craze and the number of egret skins passing through dealers reached into the millions. Complete statistics do not exist, but in the first three months of 1885, 750,000 egret skins were sold in London, while in 1887 one London dealer sold 2 million egret skins. Egret farms were set up where the birds could be plucked without being killed but most of the supply of so-called &quot;Osprey plumes&quot; was obtained by hunting, which reduced the population of the species to dangerously low levels and stimulated the establishment of Britain&#x27;s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in 1889.

By the 1950s, the little egret had become restricted to southern Europe, and conservation laws protecting the species were introduced. This allowed the population to rebound strongly; over the next few decades it became increasingly common in western France and later on the north coast. It bred in the Netherlands in 1979 with further breeding from the 1990s onward. About 22,700 pairs are thought to breed in Europe, with populations stable or increasing in Spain, France and Italy but decreasing in Greece.

In Britain it was a rare vagrant from its 16th-century disappearance until the late 20th century, and did not breed. It has however recently become a regular breeding species and is commonly present, often in large numbers, at favoured coastal sites. The first recent breeding record in England was on Brownsea Island in Dorset in 1996, and the species bred in Wales for the first time in 2002. The population increase has been rapid subsequently, with over 750 pairs breeding in nearly 70 colonies in 2008, and a post-breeding total of 4,540 birds in September 2008. The first record of breeding in Scotland happened in 2020 in Dumfries &amp; Galloway. In Ireland, the species bred for the first time in 1997 at a site in County Cork and the population has also expanded rapidly since, breeding in most Irish counties by 2010. Severe winter weather in 2010–2012 proved to be only a temporary setback, and the species continues to spread.

===Status in Australia===

In Australia, its status varies from state to state. It is listed as &quot;Threatened&quot; on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988. Under this act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has been prepared. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the little egret is listed as endangered.

===Colonisation of the New World===
With its range continuing to expand, the little egret has now started to colonise the New World. The first record there was on Barbados in April 1954. The bird began breeding on the island in 1994 and now also breeds in the Bahamas. They may have made the crossing from Western Africa. Ringed birds from Spain provide a clue to the birds&#x27; origin. The birds are very similar in appearance to the snowy egret and share colonial nesting sites with these birds in Barbados, where they are both recent arrivals. The little egrets are larger, have more varied foraging strategies and exert dominance over feeding sites.

Little egrets are seen with increasing regularity over a wider area and have been observed from Suriname and Brazil in the south to Newfoundland, Quebec and Ontario in the north. Birds on the east coast of North America are thought to have moved north with snowy egrets from the Caribbean. In June 2011, a little egret was spotted in Maine, in the Scarborough Marsh, near the Audubon Center.

<text>Astronomical spectroscopy is the study of astronomy using the techniques of spectroscopy to measure the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet, X-ray, infrared and radio waves that radiate from stars and other celestial objects. A stellar spectrum can reveal many properties of stars, such as their chemical composition, temperature, density, mass, distance and luminosity. Spectroscopy can show the velocity of motion towards or away from the observer by measuring the Doppler shift. Spectroscopy is also used to study the physical properties of many other types of celestial objects such as planets, nebulae, galaxies, and active galactic nuclei.

== Background ==
 Astronomical spectroscopy is used to measure three major bands of radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum: visible light, radio waves, and X-rays. While all spectroscopy looks at specific bands of the spectrum, different methods are required to acquire the signal depending on the frequency. Ozone (O3) and molecular oxygen (O2) absorb light with wavelengths under 300 nm, meaning that X-ray and ultraviolet spectroscopy require the use of a satellite telescope or rocket mounted detectors. Radio signals have much longer wavelengths than optical signals, and require the use of antennas or radio dishes. Infrared light is absorbed by atmospheric water and carbon dioxide, so while the equipment is similar to that used in optical spectroscopy, satellites are required to record much of the infrared spectrum.

=== Optical spectroscopy ===

Physicists have been looking at the solar spectrum since Isaac Newton first used a simple prism to observe the refractive properties of light. In the early 1800s Joseph von Fraunhofer used his skills as a glassmaker to create very pure prisms, which allowed him to observe 574 dark lines in a seemingly continuous spectrum. Soon after this, he combined telescope and prism to observe the spectrum of Venus, the Moon, Mars, and various stars such as Betelgeuse; his company continued to manufacture and sell high-quality refracting telescopes based on his original designs until its closure in 1884.

The resolution of a prism is limited by its size; a larger prism will provide a more detailed spectrum, but the increase in mass makes it unsuitable for highly detailed work. This issue was resolved in the early 1900s with the development of high-quality reflection gratings by J.S. Plaskett at the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, Canada. Light striking a mirror will reflect at the same angle, however a small portion of the light will be refracted at a different angle; this is dependent upon the indices of refraction of the materials and the wavelength of the light. By creating a &quot;blazed&quot; grating which utilizes a large number of parallel mirrors, the small portion of light can be focused and visualized. These new spectroscopes were more detailed than a prism, required less light, and could be focused on a specific region of the spectrum by tilting the grating.

The limitation to a blazed grating is the width of the mirrors, which can only be ground a finite amount before focus is lost; the maximum is around 1000 lines/mm. In order to overcome this limitation holographic gratings were developed. Volume phase holographic gratings use a thin film of dichromated gelatin on a glass surface, which is subsequently exposed to a wave pattern created by an interferometer. This wave pattern sets up a reflection pattern similar to the blazed gratings but utilizing Bragg diffraction, a process where the angle of reflection is dependent on the arrangement of the atoms in the gelatin. The holographic gratings can have up to 6000 lines/mm and can be up to twice as efficient in collecting light as blazed gratings. Because they are sealed between two sheets of glass, the holographic gratings are very versatile, potentially lasting decades before needing replacement.

Light dispersed by the grating or prism in a spectrograph can be recorded by a detector. Historically, photographic plates were widely used to record spectra until electronic detectors were developed, and today optical spectrographs most often employ charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The wavelength scale of a spectrum can be calibrated by observing the spectrum of emission lines of known wavelength from a gas-discharge lamp. The flux scale of a spectrum can be calibrated as a function of wavelength by comparison with an observation of a standard star with corrections for atmospheric absorption of light; this is known as spectrophotometry.

=== Radio spectroscopy ===
Radio astronomy was founded with the work of Karl Jansky in the early 1930s, while working for Bell Labs. He built a radio antenna to look at potential sources of interference for transatlantic radio transmissions. One of the sources of noise discovered came not from Earth, but from the center of the Milky Way, in the constellation Sagittarius. In 1942, JS Hey captured the Sun&#x27;s radio frequency using military radar receivers. Radio spectroscopy started with the discovery of the 21-centimeter H I line in 1951.

==== Radio interferometry ====
Radio interferometry was pioneered in 1946, when Joseph Lade Pawsey, Ruby Payne-Scott and Lindsay McCready used a single antenna atop a sea cliff to observe 200 MHz solar radiation. Two incident beams, one directly from the sun and the other reflected from the sea surface, generated the necessary interference. The first multi-receiver interferometer was built in the same year by Martin Ryle and Vonberg. In 1960, Ryle and Antony Hewish published the technique of aperture synthesis to analyze interferometer data. The aperture synthesis process, which involves autocorrelating and discrete Fourier transforming the incoming signal, recovers both the spatial and frequency variation in flux. The result is a 3D image whose third axis is frequency. For this work, Ryle and Hewish were jointly awarded the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics.

=== X-ray spectroscopy ===
== Stars and their properties ==

=== Chemical properties ===
Newton used a prism to split white light into a spectrum of color, and Fraunhofer&#x27;s high-quality prisms allowed scientists to see dark lines of an unknown origin. In the 1850s, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen described the phenomena behind these dark lines. Hot solid objects produce light with a continuous spectrum, hot gases emit light at specific wavelengths, and hot solid objects surrounded by cooler gases show a near-continuous spectrum with dark lines corresponding to the emission lines of the gases. By comparing the absorption lines of the Sun with emission spectra of known gases, the chemical composition of stars can be determined.

The major Fraunhofer lines, and the elements with which they are associated, appear in the following table. Designations from the early Balmer Series are shown in parentheses.

Not all of the elements in the Sun were immediately identified. Two examples are listed below:
*In 1868 Norman Lockyer and Pierre Janssen independently observed a line next to the sodium doublet (D1 and D2) which Lockyer determined to be a new element. He named it Helium, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1895 the element was found on Earth.
*In 1869 the astronomers Charles Augustus Young and William Harkness independently observed a novel green emission line in the Sun&#x27;s corona during an eclipse. This &quot;new&quot; element was incorrectly named coronium, as it was only found in the corona. It was not until the 1930s that Walter Grotrian and Bengt Edlén discovered that the spectral line at 530.3 nm was due to highly ionized iron (Fe13+). Other unusual lines in the coronal spectrum are also caused by highly charged ions, such as nickel and calcium, the high ionization being due to the extreme temperature of the solar corona.
To date more than 20 000 absorption lines have been listed for the Sun between 293.5 and 877.0 nm, yet only approximately 75% of these lines have been linked to elemental absorption.

By analyzing the equivalent width of each spectral line in an emission spectrum, both the elements present in a star and their relative abundances can be determined. Using this information stars can be categorized into stellar populations; Population I stars are the youngest stars and have the highest metal content (the Sun is a Pop I star), while Population III stars are the oldest stars with a very low metal content.

=== Temperature and size ===

In 1860 Gustav Kirchhoff proposed the idea of a black body, a material that emits electromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths. In 1894 Wilhelm Wien derived an expression relating the temperature (T) of a black body to its peak emission wavelength (λmax):
:formula_1
&quot;b&quot; is a constant of proportionality called &quot;Wien&#x27;s displacement constant&quot;, equal to This equation is called Wien&#x27;s Law. By measuring the peak wavelength of a star, the surface temperature can be determined. For example, if the peak wavelength of a star is 502 nm the corresponding temperature will be 5772 kelvins.

The luminosity of a star is a measure of the electromagnetic energy output in a given amount of time. Luminosity (L) can be related to the temperature (T) of a star by:
:formula_2 ,

where R is the radius of the star and σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, with a value of Thus, when both luminosity and temperature are known (via direct measurement and calculation) the radius of a star can be determined.

== Galaxies ==
The spectra of galaxies look similar to stellar spectra, as they consist of the combined light of billions of stars.

Doppler shift studies of galaxy clusters by Fritz Zwicky in 1937 found that the galaxies in a cluster were moving much faster than seemed to be possible from the mass of the cluster inferred from the visible light. Zwicky hypothesized that there must be a great deal of non-luminous matter in the galaxy clusters, which became known as dark matter. Since his discovery, astronomers have determined that a large portion of galaxies (and most of the universe) is made up of dark matter. In 2003, however, four galaxies (NGC 821, NGC 3379, NGC 4494, and NGC 4697) were found to have little to no dark matter influencing the motion of the stars contained within them; the reason behind the lack of dark matter is unknown.

In the 1950s, strong radio sources were found to be associated with very dim, very red objects. When the first spectrum of one of these objects was taken there were absorption lines at wavelengths where none were expected. It was soon realised that what was observed was a normal galactic spectrum, but highly red shifted. These were named &quot;quasi-stellar radio sources&quot;, or quasars, by Hong-Yee Chiu in 1964. Quasars are now thought to be galaxies formed in the early years of our universe, with their extreme energy output powered by super-massive black holes.

The properties of a galaxy can also be determined by analyzing the stars found within them. NGC 4550, a galaxy in the Virgo Cluster, has a large portion of its stars rotating in the opposite direction as the other portion. It is believed that the galaxy is the combination of two smaller galaxies that were rotating in opposite directions to each other. Bright stars in galaxies can also help determine the distance to a galaxy, which may be a more accurate method than parallax or standard candles.

== Interstellar medium ==

The interstellar medium is matter that occupies the space between star systems in a galaxy. 99% of this matter is gaseous – hydrogen, helium, and smaller quantities of other ionized elements such as oxygen. The other 1% is dust particles, thought to be mainly graphite, silicates, and ices. Clouds of the dust and gas are referred to as nebulae.

There are three main types of nebula: absorption, reflection, and emission nebulae. Absorption (or dark) nebulae are made of dust and gas in such quantities that they obscure the starlight behind them, making photometry difficult. Reflection nebulae, as their name suggest, reflect the light of nearby stars. Their spectra are the same as the stars surrounding them, though the light is bluer; shorter wavelengths scatter better than longer wavelengths. Emission nebulae emit light at specific wavelengths depending on their chemical composition.

=== Gaseous emission nebulae ===
In the early years of astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were puzzled by the spectrum of gaseous nebulae. In 1864 William Huggins noticed that many nebulae showed only emission lines rather than a full spectrum like stars. From the work of Kirchhoff, he concluded that nebulae must contain &quot;enormous masses of luminous gas or vapour.&quot; However, there were several emission lines that could not be linked to any terrestrial element, brightest among them lines at 495.9 nm and 500.7 nm. These lines were attributed to a new element, nebulium, until Ira Bowen determined in 1927 that the emission lines were from highly ionised oxygen (O+2). These emission lines could not be replicated in a laboratory because they are forbidden lines; the low density of a nebula (one atom per cubic centimetre) allows for metastable ions to decay via forbidden line emission rather than collisions with other atoms.

Not all emission nebulae are found around or near stars where solar heating causes ionisation. The majority of gaseous emission nebulae are formed of neutral hydrogen. In the ground state neutral hydrogen has two possible spin states: the electron has either the same spin or the opposite spin of the proton. When the atom transitions between these two states, it releases an emission or absorption line of 21 cm. This line is within the radio range and allows for very precise measurements:
*Velocity of the cloud can be measured via Doppler shift
*The intensity of the 21 cm line gives the density and number of atoms in the cloud
*The temperature of the cloud can be calculated
Using this information, the shape of the Milky Way has been determined to be a spiral galaxy, though the exact number and position of the spiral arms is the subject of ongoing research.

=== Complex molecules ===

Dust and molecules in the interstellar medium not only obscures photometry, but also causes absorption lines in spectroscopy. Their spectral features are generated by transitions of component electrons between different energy levels, or by rotational or vibrational spectra. Detection usually occurs in radio, microwave, or infrared portions of the spectrum. The chemical reactions that form these molecules can happen in cold, diffuse clouds or in dense regions illuminated with ultraviolet light. Most known compounds in space are organic, ranging from small molecules e.g. acetylene C2H2 and acetone (CH3)2CO; to entire classes of large molecule e.g. fullerenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; to solids, such as graphite or other sooty material.

== Motion in the universe ==

Stars and interstellar gas are bound by gravity to form galaxies, and groups of galaxies can be bound by gravity in galaxy clusters. With the exception of stars in the Milky Way and the galaxies in the Local Group, almost all galaxies are moving away from Earth due to the expansion of the universe.

=== Doppler effect and redshift ===
The motion of stellar objects can be determined by looking at their spectrum. Because of the Doppler effect, objects moving towards someone are blueshifted, and objects moving away are redshifted. The wavelength of redshifted light is longer, appearing redder than the source. Conversely, the wavelength of blueshifted light is shorter, appearing bluer than the source light:
:formula_3
where formula_4 is the emitted wavelength, formula_5 is the velocity of the object, and formula_6 is the observed wavelength. Note that v&lt;0 corresponds to λ&lt;λ0, a blueshifted wavelength. A redshifted absorption or emission line will appear more towards the red end of the spectrum than a stationary line. In 1913 Vesto Slipher determined the Andromeda Galaxy was blueshifted, meaning it was moving towards the Milky Way. He recorded the spectra of 20 other galaxies — all but four of which were redshifted — and was able to calculate their velocities relative to the Earth. Edwin Hubble would later use this information, as well as his own observations, to define Hubble&#x27;s law: The further a galaxy is from the Earth, the faster it is moving away. Hubble&#x27;s law can be generalised to:
:formula_7
where formula_8 is the velocity (or Hubble Flow), formula_9 is the Hubble Constant, and formula_10 is the distance from Earth.

Redshift (z) can be expressed by the following equations:
In these equations, frequency is denoted by formula_11 and wavelength by formula_6. The larger the value of z, the more redshifted the light and the farther away the object is from the Earth. As of January 2013, the largest galaxy redshift of z~12 was found using the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, corresponding to an age of over 13 billion years (the universe is approximately 13.82 billion years old).

The Doppler effect and Hubble&#x27;s law can be combined to form the equation formula_13,
where c is the speed of light.

=== Peculiar motion ===
Objects that are gravitationally bound will rotate around a common center of mass. For stellar bodies, this motion is known as peculiar velocity and can alter the Hubble Flow. Thus, an extra term for the peculiar motion needs to be added to Hubble&#x27;s law:
:formula_14
This motion can cause confusion when looking at a solar or galactic spectrum, because the expected redshift based on the simple Hubble law will be obscured by the peculiar motion. For example, the shape and size of the Virgo Cluster has been a matter of great scientific scrutiny due to the very large peculiar velocities of the galaxies in the cluster.

=== Binary stars ===

Just as planets can be gravitationally bound to stars, pairs of stars can orbit each other. Some binary stars are visual binaries, meaning they can be observed orbiting each other through a telescope. Some binary stars, however, are too close together to be resolved. These two stars, when viewed through a spectrometer, will show a composite spectrum: the spectrum of each star will be added together. This composite spectrum becomes easier to detect when the stars are of similar luminosity and of different spectral class.

Spectroscopic binaries can be also detected due to their radial velocity; as they orbit around each other one star may be moving towards the Earth whilst the other moves away, causing a Doppler shift in the composite spectrum. The orbital plane of the system determines the magnitude of the observed shift: if the observer is looking perpendicular to the orbital plane there will be no observed radial velocity. For example, a person looking at a carousel from the side will see the animals moving toward and away from them, whereas if they look from directly above they will only be moving in the horizontal plane.

== Planets, asteroids, and comets ==
Planets, asteroids, and comets all reflect light from their parent stars and emit their own light. For cooler objects, including Solar System planets and asteroids, most of the emission is at infrared wavelengths we cannot see, but that are routinely measured with spectrometers. For objects surrounded by gas, such as comets and planets with atmospheres, further emission and absorption happens at specific wavelengths in the gas, imprinting the spectrum of the gas on that of the solid object. In the case of worlds with thick atmospheres or complete cloud or haze cover (such as the four giant planets, Venus, and Saturn&#x27;s satellite Titan), the spectrum is mostly or completely due to the atmosphere alone.

=== Planets ===
The reflected light of a planet contains absorption bands due to minerals in the rocks present for rocky bodies, or due to the elements and molecules present in the atmosphere. To date over 3,500 exoplanets have been discovered. These include so-called Hot Jupiters, as well as Earth-like planets. Using spectroscopy, compounds such as alkali metals, water vapor, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and methane have all been discovered.

=== Asteroids ===
Asteroids can be classified into three major types according to their spectra. The original categories were created by Clark R. Chapman, David Morrison, and Ben Zellner in 1975, and further expanded by David J. Tholen in 1984. In what is now known as the Tholen classification, the C-types are made of carbonaceous material, S-types consist mainly of silicates, and X-types are &#x27;metallic&#x27;. There are other classifications for unusual asteroids. C- and S-type asteroids are the most common asteroids. In 2002 the Tholen classification was further &quot;evolved&quot; into the SMASS classification, expanding the number of categories from 14 to 26 to account for more precise spectroscopic analysis of the asteroids.

=== Comets ===

The spectra of comets consist of a reflected solar spectrum from the dusty clouds surrounding the comet, as well as emission lines from gaseous atoms and molecules excited to fluorescence by sunlight and/or chemical reactions. For example, the chemical composition of Comet ISON was determined by spectroscopy due to the prominent emission lines of cyanogen (CN), as well as two- and three-carbon atoms (C2 and C3). Nearby comets can even be seen in X-ray as solar wind ions flying to the coma are neutralized. The cometary X-ray spectra therefore reflect the state of the solar wind rather than that of the comet.

<text>American-born Chinese () (sometimes abbreviated as ABC) is a term widely used to refer to Chinese people who were born in the United States and received U.S. citizenship due to birthright citizenship in the United States.

== Contested usage ==
In comparison to the term Chinese American, &quot;American-born Chinese&quot; may not always denote U.S. citizenship, (mainland) Chinese nationals that were born in the United States often renounce their U.S. citizenship due to China prohibiting its citizens from holding multiple citizenships. According to some, the term has perpetual foreigner connotations. It has been noted that the term differs from existing patterns of immigrant designation in American English. For example, Peter Thiel is considered a &quot;German-born American&quot;. In this case, the first demographic word refers to the person&#x27;s citizenship at birth, and the second refers to his citizenship at present. However, in the case of &quot;American-born Chinese,&quot; the first demographic word refers to the subject&#x27;s citizenship at birth (or at present) and the second word to ethnicity.

It has also been observed that, in practice, the term American-born Chinese includes hundreds of thousands of Americans of Chinese descent who were, technically speaking, not born in America, but rather, were brought over by their parents at a young age. This indicates that the term may be a misnomer.

== Demographics ==

In differing degrees, many ABCs draw together Chinese family culture with American societal culture, developing a transnational life and identity. However, this begins to shift in subsequent generations as families structures change through interracial marriage. In 2000, approximately 45% of American-born Chinese marry non-Chinese Americans; this is contrasted with Chinese Americans more generally, whereby 81.5% of men and 77.9% of women married other Chinese Americans.

== In popular culture ==
The term was used in the 2006 graphic novel by Gene Luen Yang, entitled &quot;American Born Chinese&quot;. The book was adapted into the series of the same name for Disney+.

The term was used in the book Crazy Rich Asians, by Kevin Kwan, which has been adapted into a movie of the same name.

<text>A French press, also known as a cafetière, cafetière à piston, caffettiera a stantuffo, press pot, coffee press, or coffee plunger, is a coffee brewing device, although it can also be used for other tasks. The earliest known device was patented in 1852 in France by Jacques-Victor Delforge and Henri-Otto Mayer.

==Name==
In English, the device is known in North America as a &quot;French press&quot; or &quot;coffee press&quot;; in Britain and Ireland as a &quot;cafetière&quot;, after the brand, &quot;La Cafetière&quot;; in New Zealand, Australia,&lt;ref name=&quot;codeblack/plunger-french-press&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and South Africa&lt;ref name=&quot;bunacoffee/french-press-coffee-plunger&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as a &quot;coffee plunger&quot;, and coffee brewed in it as &quot;plunger coffee&quot;. In Italian, it is known as a ; in German as a &#x27;, &#x27; (&quot;stamp pot&quot;), &#x27;, &#x27; (&quot;coffee press&quot;) or &#x27;; in French as &#x27;,&lt;ref name=&quot;but.fr/article/cafetiere-a-piston&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or simply as &quot;&quot; (also the usage in Dutch), though some speakers might also use genericized trademarks, such as Melior or Bodum.

==Design history ==

Over the years, the French press has undergone several design modifications. The first coffee press, which may have been made in France, was the modern coffee press in its rudimentary form—a metal or cheesecloth screen fitted to a rod that users would press into a pot of hot water and coffee grounds. In 1852, two Frenchmen, a Paris metalsmith and a merchant,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/2014/who-french-press&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Henri-Otto Mayer and Jacques-Victor Delforge,&lt;ref name=&quot;worldgoo/press-really-france&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; patented a forerunner of the French press, that did not create a seal around the filter.&lt;ref name=&quot;coffeehow/french-press&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was filed by a Frenchman, Marcel-Pierre Paquet dit Jolbert, officially published on 5 August 1924.

In 1928,&lt;ref name=&quot;sheldrake/birth-french-press&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; a coffee press was created by Milanese designers Giulio Moneta&lt;ref name=&quot;fibsardegna/estrazione-caffe-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Attilio Calimani which had a spring to seal the filter, and patented it in the United States in 1929. It underwent several design modifications through Faliero Bondanini, who patented his own version in 1958 and manufactured it in French clarinet factory Martin SA under the brand name Melior. Its popularity may have been aided in 1965 by its use in the Michael Caine film &quot;The Ipcress File&quot;. The device was litigated and further popularized across Europe by Melior-Martin, a French company, Household Articles Ltd. (La Cafetiere), a British company, and Bodum (Chambord), a Danish tableware and kitchenware company.&lt;ref name=&quot;alternativebrewing/history-french-press&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;danishmuseum/bodum-french-press&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thecookingworld/french-press&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;retrowow/cafetiere&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern French press consists of a narrow cylindrical beaker, usually made of glass or clear plastic, equipped with a metal or plastic lid and plunger that fits tightly in the cylinder and has a fine stainless steel wire or nylon mesh filter.

==Operation==
Coffee is brewed by placing coarsely ground coffee in the empty beaker and adding hot water, , in proportions of about of coffee grounds to of water, more or less to taste. After brewing, the plunger is depressed, holding down the coffee grounds while the coffee is served.

A French press works best with coffee of a coarser grind, about the consistency of cooking salt. Finer coffee grounds, when immersed in water, have lower permeability, requiring an excessive amount of force to be applied by hand to lower the plunger and are more likely to seep through or around the perimeter of the press filter and into the coffee drink. Additionally, finer grounds will tend to over-extract and cause the coffee to taste bitter. 

Some writers give the optimal time for brewing as around four minutes. Other approaches, such as cold brewing, require several hours of contact between the water and the grounds to achieve the desired extraction.

Plunging slowly prevents accidental scalding of the brewer and is purported to maximize the extraction of the oils and flavonoids from the ground bean.&lt;ref name=&quot;seriouseats/french-press-tips&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The mesh piston normally does not compress the coffee grounds, as most designs leave a generous space—about —below the piston in its lowest position. If the brewed coffee is allowed to remain in the beaker with the used grounds, the coffee may become astringent and bitter, though this is an effect that some users of the French press consider desirable.

==Variations==

French presses are more portable and self-contained than other coffee makers. Travel mug versions exist, which are made of tough plastic instead of the more common glass, and have a sealed lid with a closable drinking hole. Some versions are marketed to hikers and backpackers not wishing to carry a heavy, metal percolator or a filter using drip brew.

Other versions include stainless steel, insulated presses designed to keep the coffee hot, similar in design to thermos flasks. Coffee filters commonly used in South Indian households are a stainless steel version but without insulation. The decant known as decoction is mixed immediately with milk and sugar to make kaapi.

One variation also called &quot;French pull&quot; or &quot;reverse French press&quot; uses a pull-design: the coffee grounds are placed in a mesh basket, which is then pulled into the lid after brewing, trapping the grounds out of the coffee. Others produce a similar effect by having shutters that can be closed via the top of the press, sealing the grounds off from the coffee entirely. French presses are also sometimes used to make cold brew coffee.

Another variation using a basket to hold the coffee grounds is called &quot;American press&quot;, where the hot water is filled in first and then the basket is slowly pushed down (and sometimes also pulled up again) through the water column.

An all-in-one French press consists of a heating element that can receive its power from a 12-volt power source.

==Other uses==
In the same way as coffee, a French press can also be used in place of a tea infuser to brew loose tea. To some extent the tea will continue to steep even after the plunger is depressed, which may cause the tea remaining in the press to become bitter. It might thus be advisable to decant the tea into a serving vessel after preparation. The same French press should not be used for both tea and coffee unless thoroughly cleaned, as coffee residue may spoil the flavor of the tea. However, this method is more suitable for light teas and is not suitable for masala chai (which must be boiled) or Chinese tea (which tends to be diffused for a long time, with tea leaves reused as a rule).

A French press can also be used for straining broth from shellfish or other ingredients.

<text>Richard Sambrook is a British journalist, academic and a former BBC executive. He is emeritus professor in the School of Journalism, Media and Culture at Cardiff University. For 30 years, until February 2010, he was a BBC journalist and later, a news executive.

==Early life and BBC career==
Sambrook was educated at Maidstone Technical High School, the University of Reading (BA in English) and Birkbeck College, University of London (MSc in politics). His career began in local newspapers in South Wales.

His 30 years at the BBC were almost entirely in the news. He was successively a programme editor, news editor and head of newsgathering when the corporation won many awards for its international news coverage. He merged radio and television news, and domestic and World Service newsgathering during this time, resulting in the world&#x27;s largest broadcast news operation. He was acting director of sport in 2000, and became director of news in 2001.

Sambrook defended in June/July 2003 what became the highly controversial &quot;Today&quot; programme report that the Blair government had in its &quot;September Dossier&quot; knowingly exaggerated claims relating to Iraq&#x27;s supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction. On 20 July, he confirmed that Dr. David Kelly had been the source of the news item. He later gave evidence to the Hutton Inquiry into Kelly&#x27;s apparent suicide.

He spent ten years on the management board of the BBC becoming successively director of BBC Sport, director of BBC News and finally director of the World Service and Global News in September 2004. He oversaw major restructuring of the World Service, and its opening of Arabic and Persian television, as well as commercial interactive services. He is a frequent contributor to radio and TV coverage of media issues and writes regularly for The Conversation (website).

==Other and subsequent roles==

From 2010 until 2012, he was global vice chairman and chief content officer of the Edelman public relations agency. From January 2010 until 2017, he was a visiting research fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford and a professor of journalism at Cardiff University. He devised and launched one of the first degree courses in computational journalism in partnership with the computer science department at Cardiff. He has published several books and research papers on journalism including on international news, the future of TV News and the role of impartiality in digital news. In 2020 the BBC commissioned him to review staff use of social media.

His non-executive roles have largely supported free speech and independent journalism. He is co-chair of The Bureau for Investigative Journalism.

From 2012 until 2018 he led the International News Safety Institute, for which he chaired an inquiry into the deaths of journalists around the world. From 2006 to 2009, he was vice president of the European Broadcasting Union and represented public broadcasters on the advisory group to the UN&#x27;s Internet Governance Forum. He was a trustee of the free-speech NGO Article 19 for six years and was a member of the leadership committee of the Global Media AIDS Initiative, established by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in 2004. He was on the advisory board of the British Council and was formerly Chairman of the BBC&#x27;s international charity, the World Service Trust (now BBC Media Action). He was a trustee of the WWF-UK from 2010 to 2016. He is a Fellow of the Royal Television Society and of the Royal Society of Arts.

==Personal life==
Sambrook is married with two children.

<doc id="273703" wikidata="Q4437810" url="?curid=273703" title="Power management">
<text>Power management is a feature of some electrical appliances, especially copiers, computers, computer CPUs, computer GPUs and computer peripherals such as monitors and printers, that turns off the power or switches the system to a low-power state when inactive. In computing this is known as PC power management and is built around a standard called ACPI which superseded
APM. All recent computers have ACPI support.

==Motivations==
PC power management for computer systems is desired for many reasons, particularly:
* Reduce overall energy consumption
* Prolong battery life for portable and embedded systems
* Reduce cooling requirements
* Reduce noise
* Reduce operating costs for energy and cooling

Lower power consumption also means lower heat dissipation, which increases system stability, and less energy use, which saves money and reduces the impact on the environment.

==Processor level techniques==
The power management for microprocessors can be done over the whole processor, or in specific components, such as cache memory and main memory.

With dynamic voltage scaling and dynamic frequency scaling, the CPU core voltage, clock rate, or both, can be altered to decrease power consumption at the price of potentially lower performance. This is sometimes done in real time to optimize the power-performance tradeoff.

Examples:
* AMD Cool&#x27;n&#x27;Quiet
* AMD PowerNow!
* IBM EnergyScale
* Intel SpeedStep
* Transmeta LongRun and LongRun2
* VIA LongHaul (PowerSaver)

Additionally, processors can selectively power off internal circuitry (power gating). For example:
* Newer Intel Core processors support ultra-fine power control over the functional units within the processors.
* AMD CoolCore technology get more efficient performance by dynamically activating or turning off parts of the processor.

Intel VRT technology split the chip into a 3.3V I/O section and a 2.9V core section. The lower core voltage reduces power consumption.

===Heterogeneous computing===
ARM&#x27;s big.LITTLE architecture can migrate processes between faster &quot;big&quot; cores and more power efficient &quot;LITTLE&quot; cores.

==Operating system level: hibernation==

When a computer system hibernates it saves the contents of the RAM to disk and powers down the machine. On startup it reloads the data. This allows the system to be completely powered off while in hibernate mode. This requires a file the size of the installed RAM to be placed on the hard disk, potentially using up space even when not in hibernate mode. Hibernate mode is enabled by default in some versions of Windows and can be disabled in order to recover this disk space.

==In GPUs==
Graphics processing unit (GPUs) are used together with a CPU to accelerate computing in variety of domains revolving around scientific, analytics, engineering, consumer and enterprise applications.
All of this comes with some drawbacks, the high computing capability of GPUs comes at the cost of high power dissipation. Much research has been done over the power dissipation issue of GPUs and many techniques have been proposed to address this issue. Dynamic voltage scaling/dynamic frequency scaling (DVFS) and clock gating are two commonly used techniques for reducing dynamic power in GPUs.

===DVFS techniques===
Experiments show that conventional processor DVFS policy can achieve power reduction of embedded GPUs with reasonable performance degradation. New directions for designing effective DVFS schedulers for heterogeneous systems are also being explored. A heterogeneous CPU-GPU architecture, GreenGPU is presented which employs DVFS in a synchronized way, both for GPU and CPU. GreenGPU is implemented using the CUDA framework on a real physical testbed with Nvidia GeForce GPUs and AMD Phenom II CPUs. Experimentally it is shown that the GreenGPU achieves 21.04% average energy savings and outperforms several well-designed baselines.
For the mainstream GPUs which are extensively used in all kinds of commercial and personal applications several DVFS techniques exist and are built into the GPUs alone, AMD PowerTune and AMD ZeroCore Power are the two dynamic frequency scaling technologies for AMD graphic cards. Practical tests showed that reclocking a GeForce GTX 480 can achieve a 28% lower power consumption while only decreasing performance by 1% for a given task.

===Power gating techniques===
Much research has been done on the dynamic power reduction with the use of DVFS techniques. However, as technology continues to shrink, leakage power will become a dominant factor. Power gating is a commonly used circuit technique to remove leakage by turning off the supply voltage of unused circuits. Power gating incurs energy overhead; therefore, unused circuits need to remain idle long enough to compensate this overheads.
A novel micro-architectural technique for run-time power-gating caches of GPUs saves leakage energy. Based on experiments on 16 different GPU workloads, the average energy savings achieved by the proposed technique is 54%.
Shaders are the most power hungry component of a GPU, a predictive shader shut down power gating technique achieves up to 46% leakage reduction on shader processors.
The Predictive Shader Shutdown technique exploits workload variation across frames to eliminate leakage in shader clusters. Another technique called Deferred Geometry Pipeline seeks to minimize leakage in fixed-function geometry units by utilizing an imbalance between geometry and fragment computation across batches which removes up to 57% of the leakage in the fixed-function geometry units. A simple time-out power gating method can be applied to non-shader execution units which eliminates 83.3% of the leakage in non-shader execution units on average.
All the three techniques stated above incur negligible performance degradation, less than 1%.

===Screen power saving techniques===
On some laptops and smartphones, the screen power saving technique is used. Such technique is dynamatically change the backlight brightness and the LCD offset to decrease screen power. Examples of such technique included Intel Display Power Saving Technology (DPST).

<text>Anthony Ronald Yary (born July 16, 1946) is an American former professional football offensive tackle who played in the National Football League (NFL), primarily for the Minnesota Vikings, and also for the Los Angeles Rams. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1987 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001. Yary gave credit for his Pro Football Hall of Fame induction to his former coaches, John Ashton (high school) John McKay (college) and Bud Grant (professional). He also praised his position coaches Marv Goux, Dave Levy, John Michaels and Jerry Burns.

==Early life==
Yary attended Bellflower High School in Los Angeles County, California, and then spent one season at Cerritos College in 1964. In October 2001, the school named the football field Ron Yary Stadium. While attending Bellflower High School, Yary starred in football, baseball, and basketball.

==College career==
Yary was born in Chicago and attended Cerritos College in the fall semester of 1964. He then in the spring semester of (1965) transferred to the University of Southern California, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. As a sophomore in 1965, Yary was voted the Pac-8 defensive lineman of the year and All-West Coast for his play at defensive tackle. As a junior, he was moved to the offensive line where he was a consensus All-American as a junior in 1966 and a unanimous All-American choice in 1967, his senior year. He was the 1967 winner of both the Outland Trophy and the Knute Rockne Award, awards that annually go to the nation&#x27;s top collegiate lineman. Yary was the first USC Trojan to win the Outland. In Yary&#x27;s senior year of 1967 the Trojans won the NCAA football national championship under Coach John McKay. During Yary&#x27;s three seasons, the Trojans compiled a 24-7-1 record. In 1987 Yary was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame on December 30, 2012, representing USC.

==Professional career==
Yary was the first overall pick of the 1968 NFL draft by the Minnesota Vikings, who had traded Fran Tarkenton to the New York Giants for that selection, becoming the first offensive lineman ever to be selected first overall. He played from 1968 to 1981 with the Minnesota Vikings, and 1982 with the Los Angeles Rams. During Yary&#x27;s tenure with the Vikings, the team won 11 division titles. During that period, Minnesota won the 1969 NFL championship and NFC titles in 1973, 1974 and 1976, and played in Super Bowls IV, VIII, IX and XI where Yary was one of 11 Players to have played in all four games for the Vikings. Yary was named All-Pro 6 consecutive seasons (1971–76) and 2nd Team All-Pro in 1970 and 1977 and was an All-NFC choice from 1970 through 1977. He played in seven consecutive Pro Bowls, and was a major force in a Minnesota team that was highly successful throughout the 1970s. In addition to his All-pro honors, Yary was voted the NFC Offensive Lineman of the Year three times (1973–75) by the NFLPA and was named the NFL Outstanding Blocker of the Year by the 1,000 yard Club for 1975.

Yary won the starting right tackle job (military duty forced him to miss first three games) on the Vikings offensive line in his second season and remained as a fixture at that spot throughout his Minnesota tenure. He was voted to the 1970s All-Decade First Team after the 1979 season.

Yary was also durable and played in spite of injuries. He missed only two games due to injuries—both coming in 1980 with a broken ankle—in 14 years in Minnesota. Later that same year, he continued to play in spite of a broken foot. He was inducted to the Vikings Ring of Honor in 2000. He became a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001. He was the last offensive lineman to ever be drafted first overall until Orlando Pace was selected by Rams in 1997.

==Personal life==
Yary is married to his wife Jamie and has two sons, Jack (born 2001) and Grant (born 2005) and a daughter, Kinley (born c. 2010). Yary resides in Murrieta, California, and once co-owned a sports photography business with his brother Wayne, who bought Ron out in 2001. His son Jack was a tight end for Murrieta Valley High School, and was committed to play at University of Washington before dropping out of the program.

<doc id="273706" wikidata="Q166794" url="?curid=273706" title="Pallas's cat">
<text>The Pallas&#x27;s cat (Otocolobus manul), also known as the manul, is a small wild cat with long and dense light grey fur, and rounded ears set low on the sides of the head. Its head-and-body length ranges from with a long bushy tail. It is well camouflaged and adapted to the cold continental climate in its native range, which receives little rainfall and experiences a wide range of temperatures.

The Pallas&#x27;s cat was first described in 1776 by Peter Simon Pallas, who observed it in the vicinity of Lake Baikal. Since then, it has been recorded across a large region in Central Asia, albeit in widely spaced sites from the Caucasus, Iranian Plateau, Hindu Kush, parts of the Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau to the Altai-Sayan region and South Siberian Mountains. It inhabits rocky montane grasslands and shrublands, where the snow cover is below . It finds shelter in rock s and burrows, and preys foremost on lagomorphs and rodents. The female gives birth to between two and six kittens in spring.

Due to its widespread range and assumed large population, the Pallas&#x27;s cat has been listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2020. Some population units are threatened by poaching, prey base decline due to rodent control programs, and habitat fragmentation as a result of mining and infrastructure projects.

The Pallas&#x27;s cat has been kept in zoos since the early 1950s. 60 zoos in Europe, Russia, North America and Japan participate in Pallas&#x27;s cat captive breeding programs.

==Etymology==
&#x27;Manul&#x27; is the Pallas&#x27;s cat&#x27;s name in the Mongolian language. It is called &#x27;manol&#x27; in the Kyrgyz language. The common name &#x27;Pallas&#x27;s cat&#x27; was coined by William Thomas Blanford in honour of Peter Simon Pallas.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Felis manul&quot; was the scientific name used by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776, who first described a Pallas&#x27;s cat that he had encountered near the Dzhida River southeast of Lake Baikal.
Several Pallas&#x27;s cat zoological specimens were subsequently described:
*&quot;Felis nigripectus&quot; proposed by Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1842 was based on three specimens from Tibet.
*&quot;Otocolobus manul ferrugineus&quot; proposed by Sergey Ognev in 1928 was an erythristic specimen from the Kopet Dag mountains.

&quot;Otocolobus&quot; was proposed by Johann Friedrich von Brandt in 1842 as a generic name. Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic rank of &quot;Otocolobus&quot; in 1907, described several Pallas&#x27;s cat skulls in detail and considered the Pallas&#x27;s cat an aberrant form of &quot;Felis&quot;.

In 1951, John Ellerman and Terence Morrison-Scott considered
*the nominate subspecies &quot;Felis manul manul&quot; to be distributed from Russian Turkestan to Transbaikalia;
*&quot;F. m. nigripecta&quot; to be distributed in Tibet and Kashmir;
*&quot;F. m. ferruginea&quot; occurring from southwestern Turkestan and the Kopet Dag mountains to Afghanistan and Balochistan.

Since 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group recognises only two subspecies as valid taxa, namely:
*&quot;O. m. manul&quot; syn. &quot;O. m. ferrugineus&quot; in the western and northern part of Central Asia from Iran to Mongolia;
*&quot;O. m. nigripectus&quot; in the Himalayas from Kashmir to Bhutan.

===Phylogeny===
Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that the evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the late Miocene around . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at around .
The Pallas&#x27;s cat is estimated to have genetically diverged from a common ancestor with the genus &quot;Prionailurus&quot; between based on analysis of nuclear DNA. Based on analysis of mitochondrial DNA, it diverged from a common ancestor with &quot;Felis&quot;.


==Characteristics==

The Pallas&#x27;s cat&#x27;s fur is light grey with pale yellowish-ochre or pale yellowish-reddish hues. Some hair tips are white and some blackish. Its fur is greyer and denser with fewer markings visible in winter than in the summer. The forehead and top of the head are light grey with small black spots. It has two black zigzag lines on the cheeks running from the corner of the eyes to the jaw joints. Its chin, whiskers, lower and upper lips are white.
It has narrow black stripes on the back, consisting of five to seven dark lines across the lower back. Its grey tail has seven narrow black rings and a black tip. The underfur is long and 19 μm thick, and the guard hairs up to long and 93 μm thick on the back. Its fur is soft and dense with up to .

The Pallas&#x27;s cat&#x27;s ears are grey with a yellowish tinge on the back and a darker rim, but with whitish hair in front and in the ear pinnae. Its rounded ears are set low on the side, such that it can peer over an object and show only a relatively small part of the head above the eyes without depressing the ears. This can give its face a look of ferocity and unrest. Its eyes are encircled by white. The iris is yellowish, and its pupils contract to small circular disks in sunlight. Among the Felinae, it shares this trait of round pupils with &quot;Puma&quot;, &quot;Herpailurus&quot; and &quot;Acinonyx&quot; species.

The Pallas&#x27;s cat is about the size of a domestic cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;). Its stocky posture with the long and dense fur make it appear stout and plush. Its head-to-body is long with a long tail. It weighs .
Its body is stout, and its skull is rounded with a short nasal bone, an enlarged cranial part and rounded zygomatic arches. Its orbits are large and directed forward. Its legs are short with short and sharp claws. 

The skull of males is long and wide at the base. Females have a long and wide skull. The lower carnassial teeth are powerful, and the upper carnassials are short and massive. The first pair of upper premolars is absent. The dental formula is . It has a bite force at the canine tip of 155.4 newtons and a bite force quotient at the canine tip of 113.8.

The mitochondrial genome of the Pallas&#x27;s cat consists of 16,672 base pairs containing 13 protein-coding, 22 transfer RNA and two ribosomal RNA genes and one non-coding RNA control region.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Pallas&#x27;s cat&#x27;s range extends from the Caucasus eastward to Central Asia, Mongolia and adjacent parts of Dzungaria and the Tibetan Plateau. It inhabits montane shrublands and grasslands, rocky outcrops, scree s and ravines in areas, where the continuous snow cover is below .
In the southwestern part of its range, the habitat of the Pallas&#x27;s cat is affected by cold and dry winters, and moderate to low rainfall in warm summers. The typical vegetation in this part consists of small shrubs, sagebrush (&quot;Artemisia&quot;), &quot;Festuca&quot; and &quot;Stipa&quot; grasses.
In the central part of its range, it inhabits hilly landscapes, high plateaus and intermontane valleys that are covered by dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation, such as low shrubs and xerophytic grasses. The continental climate in this region exhibits a range of between the highest and lowest air temperatures, dropping to in winter.

The Greater Caucasus region is considered climatically suitable for the Pallas&#x27;s cat. In Armenia, an individual was killed near Vedi in the mountains of Ararat Province in the late 1920s. In January 2020, an individual was sighted about farther north in Tavush Province; the habitat at this location transitions from semi-desert to montane steppe at an elevation of about . Records in Azerbaijan are limited to a Pallas&#x27;s cat skin found in Karabakh and a sighting of an individual in Julfa District, both in the late 20th century.
On the Iranian Plateau, two Pallas&#x27;s cats were encountered near the Aras River in northwestern Iran before the 1970s. In the area, an individual was captured at an elevation of about near Azarshahr in East Azerbaijan Province in 2008. In the same year, a camera trap recorded a Pallas&#x27;s cat on the southern slopes of the central Alborz Mountains in Khojir National Park shortly after heavy snowfall. Farther east in the Alborz Mountains, an individual was recorded among rocks at an elevation of in 2016. In the Aladagh and Kopet Dag Mountains, the Pallas&#x27;s cat was recorded inside and in the vicinity of protected areas. In the south of the Zagros Mountains, an individual was caught in a corral used by transhumant pastoralists in Abadeh County in 2012. The surrounding area consists of rocky steppe habitat dominated by mountain almond (&quot;Prunus scoparia&quot;), &quot;Astragalus&quot; and &quot;Artemisia&quot;.
In the Hindu Kush, a Pallas&#x27;s cat was observed sunbathing at the fringe of a rocky high-elevation plain near Dasht-e Nawar in Afghanistan&#x27;s Koh-i-Baba range in April 2007. The Pallas&#x27;s cat was also photographed multiple times in Bamyan Province between 2015 and 2017.
In Pakistan&#x27;s Qurumber National Park in Gilgit-Baltistan, an individual was recorded on a ridge in a juniper dominated forest at in July 2012.

In the Transcaspian Region, its presence was first reported in the Kopet Dag mountains and in the vicinity of the Tedzhen and Murghab Rivers in the late 19th century. In Turkmenistan&#x27;s Sünt-Hasardag Nature Reserve, a camera trap recorded an individual in 2019. The Pallas&#x27;s cat is allegedly also present in Köpetdag Nature Reserve.

Historical records of the Pallas&#x27;s cat are known in the Surxondaryo Region and Gissar Range along the border of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In Kyrgyzstan, it is present at high elevations of Sarychat-Ertash State Nature Reserve and in the foothills of the Alay Range. In 2013, a dead female was found in a valley near Engilchek, Kyrgyzstan. In Kazakhstan, it inhabits the highlands and steppes of central and east Kazakhstan Region, the periphery of the Betpak-Dala Desert, the northern Balkhash District and the Tarbagatai Mountains.

In the South Siberian Mountains, it inhabits grasslands on the Ukok Plateau and in the Altai, Kuray and Saylyugem Mountains. It is also present in Chagan-Uzun and Argut river basins, Mongun-Taiga, Uvs Lake Basin, Sayano-Shushenski Nature Reserve, Tunkinsky National Park, Lake Gusinoye basin and in the interfluves of the Selenga, Chikoy and Khilok rivers. In the eastern Sayan Mountains, its presence was documented for the first time in 1997. In Transbaikal, it inhabits montane steppes at elevations of , where annual rainfall ranges from . In 2013, an individual was observed on the Vitim Plateau.

The Pallas&#x27;s cat inhabits the semi-desert steppe of Ikh Nartiin Chuluu Nature Reserve in Mongolia. In Khustain Nuruu National Park and Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park, it prefers rocky and rugged habitats that provides cover and camouflage.
On the Tibetan plateau, two Pallas&#x27;s cats were observed in undulating alpine meadow amidst plateau pika (&quot;Ochotona curzoniae&quot;) colonies at in western China&#x27;s Qumarlêb County in 2001. One of them swam across an irrigation channel. In Gêrzê County, an individual was sighted in desert steppe habitat at an elevation of in 2005. In 2011, the Pallas&#x27;s cat was photographed in an alpine meadow in the core area of Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve. In Ruoergai, it was observed at several places in habitat that was frequented by pastoralists and their livestock herds.

The presence of the Pallas&#x27;s cat in the Himalayas was first reported in Ladakh&#x27;s Indus valley in 1991. In Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary, Pallas&#x27;s cats were sighted close by riverbanks at elevations of in 2013 and 2015. In Gangotri National Park, a Pallas&#x27;s cat was photographed in rocky scrub at in 2019. In Sikkim, an individual was observed on a rocky slope at an elevation of in the vicinity of Tso Lhamo Lake in 2007.
In December 2012, the Pallas&#x27;s cat was recorded for the first time in the Nepal Himalayas. It was photographed in the upper Marshyangdi river valley in alpine pastures at elevations of and in Annapurna Conservation Area. In Shey-Phoksundo National Park, Pallas&#x27;s cat was detected at in 2016, the globally highest record to date.
In January 2012, it was recorded for the first time in Bhutan, namely in rolling hills dominated by glacial outwash and alpine steppe vegetation in Wangchuck Centennial National Park. In autumn 2012, it was also photographed at an elevation of in Jigme Dorji National Park. In 2019, scat samples of two individuals were found in Sagarmatha National Park, providing the first genetic evidence of the cat&#x27;s presence in the eastern Himalayas.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The Pallas&#x27;s cat is solitary. Of nine Pallas&#x27;s cat kittens observed in captivity, only the two males scent marked by spraying urine.

The Pallas&#x27;s cat uses caves, rock crevices and marmot burrows as shelter. In central Mongolia, 29 Pallas&#x27;s cats were fitted with radio collars between June 2005 and October 2007. They used 101 during this time, including 39 winter dens, 42 summer dens and 20 dens for raising kittens. The summer and winter dens usually had one entrance with a diameter of . They resided in the summer dens for 2–21 days, and in the winter dens for 2–28 days. Summer and maternal dens were close to rocky habitats with little direct sunlight, whereas winter dens were closer to ravines. The home ranges of 16 females varied from . The home ranges of nine males varied from and ped those of one to four females and partly also those of other males. The sizes of their home ranges decreased in winter.

In an unprotected area in central Mongolia, Pallas&#x27;s cats were mainly crepuscular between May and August, but active by day from September to November. Pallas&#x27;s cats recorded in four study areas in the western Mongolian Altai mountains were also active during the day, but with a lower frequency at sites where livestock was present.

===Hunting and diet===
The Pallas&#x27;s cat is a highly specialised predator of small mammals, which it catches by stalking or ambushing near exits of burrows. It also pulls out rodents with its paws from shallow burrows. In the Altai Mountains, remains of long-tailed ground squirrel (&quot;Urocitellus undulatus&quot;), flat-skulled shrew (&quot;Sorex roboratus&quot;), Pallas&#x27;s pika (&quot;Ochotona pallasi&quot;) and bird feathers were found near breeding burrows of Pallas&#x27;s cats. In Transbaikal, it preys on Daurian pika (&quot;Ochotona dauurica&quot;), steppe pika (&quot;O. pusilla&quot;), Daurian ground squirrel (&quot;Spermophilus dauricus&quot;) and young of red-billed chough (&quot;Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax&quot;).
Scat samples of the Pallas&#x27;s cat collected in the bufferzone of Khustain Nuruu National Park in central Mongolia contained foremost remains of Daurian pika, Mongolian gerbil (&quot;Meriones unguiculatus&quot;), Mongolian silver vole (&quot;Alticola semicanus&quot;) and remains of passerine birds, beetles and grasshoppers. Brandt&#x27;s vole (&quot;Lasiopodomys brandtii&quot;) dominated in the diet of Pallas&#x27;s cats in Mongolia&#x27;s Sükhbaatar Province after the irruptive growth of this vole population during 2017 to 2020.
Scat found in Shey-Phoksundo National Park contained remains of pika species and of woolly hare (&quot;Lepus oiostolus&quot;). Remains of a cypriniform fish were found in Pallas&#x27;s cat scat in Gongga Mountain Nature Reserve.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

The female is sexually mature at the age of about one year. She is in estrus for 26 to 42 hours. Gestation lasts 66 to 75 days.

A captive male Pallas&#x27;s cat housed under natural lighting conditions showed increased aggressive and territorial behaviour at the onset of the breeding season, lasting from September to December. Its blood contained three times more testosterone than in the non-breeding season, and its ejaculate was more concentrated with more normal sperm forms and a higher motility of sperm.

In the wild, the female gives birth to a litter of two to six kittens between the end of April and late May. The newborn kittens&#x27; fur is fuzzy, and their eyes are closed until the age of about two weeks. A newborn male kitten born in a zoo weighed , measured and had a long tail.

In central Mongolia, seven females with kittens were observed using 20 dens for 4–60 days. Their maternal dens were either among rocks, or in former burrows of the Tarbagan marmot (&quot;Marmota sibirica&quot;), and had at least two entrances. In Iran, a Pallas&#x27;s cat was observed using cavities of aged Greek juniper (&quot;Juniperus excelsa&quot;) as breeding dens for a litter of four kittens.

Two-month-old kittens weigh , and their fur gradually grows longer. They start hunting at the age of about five months and reach adult size by the age of six to seven months.

==Threats==
In China, Mongolia and Russia, the Pallas&#x27;s cat was once hunted for its fur in large numbers of more than 10,000 skins annually. In China and the former Soviet Union, hunting of the Pallas&#x27;s cat decreased in the 1970s when it became legally protected. Mongolia exported 9,185 skins in 1987, but international trade has ceased since 1988. However, domestic trade of its skins and body parts for medicinal purposes continues in the country, and it may be hunted throughout the year.

Cases of herding dogs killing Pallas&#x27;s cats were reported in Iran, Kazakhstan and the Altai Republic.
Pallas&#x27;s cats have also fallen victim in s set for small mammals in Kazakhstan and in the Altai Republic. In Transbaikal, the Pallas&#x27;s cat is threatened by poaching. In Mongolia, the use of the rodenticide bromadiolone in the frame of rodent control measures in the early 21st century poisoned the prey base of carnivores and raptors.
In the Sanjiangyuan region of the Tibetan Plateau, of grassland was poisoned between 2005 and 2009, leading to an estimated loss of of pika biomass.
The Pallas&#x27;s cat may be negatively affected by habitat fragmentation due to mining and infrastructure projects.

==Conservation==

On the IUCN Red List, the Pallas&#x27;s cat is classified as Least Concern since 2020 because of its wide-spread range and assumed large global population. It is listed in CITES Appendix II. Hunting it is prohibited in all range countries except Mongolia. Since 2009, it is legally protected in Afghanistan, where all hunting and trade with its body parts is banned.
On the Mongolian Red List of Mammals, it is listed as Near Threatened since 2006. In China, it is listed as Endangered. In Turkmenistan, it is proposed to be listed as Critically Endangered due to the scarcity of contemporary records.

===In captivity===
Between 1951 and 1979, the Beijing Zoo kept 16 Pallas&#x27;s cats, but they lived for less than three years. In 1984, the Pallas&#x27;s cat was designated as a priority species for captive breeding of the American Association of Zoos and Aquariums&#x27;s Species Survival Plan. Almost half of the kittens born in member zoos died within the first 30 days, reaching the highest mortality rate in captivity of any small wild cat.

Zoos in the former Soviet Union received most of the wild-caught Pallas&#x27;s cats from the Transbaikal region and a few from Mongolia. Moscow Zoo initiated a studbook for the Pallas&#x27;s cat in 1997. Since 2004, the Pallas&#x27;s cat international studbook has been managed by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which also coordinates the captive breeding program for the Pallas&#x27;s cat within the European Endangered Species Programme. As of 2018, 177 Pallas&#x27;s cats were kept in 60 zoos in Europe, Russia, North America and Japan.

In 2011, a female Pallas&#x27;s cat was artificially inseminated for the first time with semen from the male at the Cincinnati Zoo. After 69 days, she gave birth to four kittens, of which one was stillborn.

== In popular culture ==
The Pallas&#x27;s cat is featured in a Russian Internet meme known as &quot;Pet the cat&quot; introduced in 2008; the meme is a picture of a Pallas&#x27;s cat that invites the reader to pet it in the image&#x27;s caption. In 2012, the Pallas&#x27;s cat became the mascot of Moscow Zoo.

<text>Drip coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, allowing it to brew while seeping through. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip-brewed coffee, or, somewhat inaccurately, filtered coffee in general. Manually brewed drip coffee is typically referred to as pour-over coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot.

== History ==
Commercial paper coffee filters were invented in Germany by Melitta Bentz in 1908 and are commonly used for drip brew all over the world. In 1944, Willy Brand developed an automatic drip-brewer utilizing circular paper filters in Switzerland. In 1954, one of the first electric drip brewers, the Wigomat invented by Gottlob Widmann, was patented in Germany. Drip brew coffee makers largely replaced the coffee percolator (a device combining boiling, drip-brewing and steeping) in the 1970s due to the percolator&#x27;s tendency to over-extract coffee, thereby making it bitter. One benefit of paper filters is that the used grounds and the filter may be disposed together, without a need to clean the filter. Permanent filters are also common, made of thin perforated metal sheets, fine plastic mesh, porous ceramics or glazed porcelain sieves that restrain the grounds but allow the coffee to pass, thus eliminating the need to have to purchase separate filters which sometimes cannot be found in some parts of the world. These add to the maintenance of the machine but reduce overall cost and produce less waste.

== Characteristics ==
Brewing with a paper filter produces clear, light-bodied coffee. While free of sediments, such coffee is lacking in some of coffee&#x27;s oils and essences; they have been trapped in the paper filter. Metal, nylon or porcelain mesh filters do not normally remove these components.

It may be observed, especially when using a tall, narrow carafe, that the coffee at the bottom of the coffeepot is stronger than that at the top. This is because less flavor is available for extraction from the coffee grounds as the brewing process progresses. A mathematical argument has been made that delivering comparable strength in two cups of coffee is nearly achieved using a Thue–Morse sequence of pours. This analysis prompted a whimsical article in the popular press.

== Cultural impact ==

Filter coffee is central to Japanese coffee culture and connoisseurship.

In South India, filter coffee brewed at home is known as &quot;Kaapi&quot; and is a part of local culture. Most houses have a stainless-steel coffee filter and most shops sell freshly roasted and ground coffee beans. Some popular filter coffee brands include Mysore café, Hill coffee (Suresh healthcare), Cothas Coffee (Bangalore) and Narasu&#x27;s Coffee (Salem). It is common in South India and Louisiana to add chicory to coffee to give it a unique taste and flavour.

==Methods==
There are a number of methods and pieces of equipment for making drip-brewed coffee.

===Manual pour-over coffee preparation===
Pour-over methods are popular ways of making specialty drip coffee. The method involves pouring water over a bed of coffee (sometimes also called &quot;cake&quot;) in a filter-lined conical or cylindrical chamber typically consisting of a filter and a suitable filter holder. The filtering can be with paper, cloth, plastic, ceramics, or metal.

The quality of the resulting coffee is extremely dependent on the technique of the user, with pour-over brewing being a popular method used in the World Brewers Cup.

The pour-over coffee preparation method typically starts by pouring a small amount of hot water over the coffee grounds and allow it to sit for about half a minute before continuing the pouring. This pre-wetting, called &quot;blooming&quot;, will cause carbon dioxide to be released in bubbles or foam from the coffee grounds and helps to improve the taste.

There are several manual drip-brewing devices on the market, offering more control over brewing parameters than automatic machines, and which incorporate stopper valves and other innovations that offer greater control over steeping time and the proportion of coffee to water. There also exist small, portable, single-serving drip brew makers that only hold the filter and rest on top of a mug or cup, making them a popular option for backcountry campers and hikers. Hot water is poured in and drips directly into the cup.

Different filter shapes and sizes exist, most notable the (paper) coffee filter systems introduced by Melitta (1908, 1932, 1936, 1965), Chemex (1941) and Hario (2004).

=== Manual drip-coffee makers ===
==== Cafetière du Belloy and similar coffee makers ====


Manual drip coffee makers include the so-called French drip coffee pot (invented in 1795 by and manufactured by a metal-smith in Rouen, then popularized by bishop Jean-Baptiste de Belloy for why it became known as in Paris since 1800 to the point that it was sometimes incorrectly attributed to the bishop himself), the (, , etc.) originating from La Réunion and also common in Louisiana, and the so-called (Quedlinburg, Germany, c. 1900).
French drip devices emerged from the earlier coffee biggins where cloth filters would be fully inserted into the pot for steeping instead of drip filtering. French drip coffee pots don&#x27;t use paper filters but a permanent filter featuring many small round drilled holes made out of (enameled) metal, ceramics or porcelain. A cafetière du Belloy was originally made out of tin, later versions were made out of silver, copper, ceramics or porcelain. The Grègue and the are built out of (enameled) metal. To avoid sediments in the coffee, coarsely ground coffee has to be used.

Around 1895, skyblue enameled metal coffee pots named were introduced in Denmark by Glud &amp; Marstrand. They looked similar to French drip coffee pots, but used cotton filters and were available in 18 sizes for up to 50 cups of coffee.
The &quot;Drip-O-lator&quot; is an American coffee pot for making drip coffee patented in 1921 and in 1930 and manufactured in Massillon, Ohio, or Macon, Georgia, United States. The production of Drip-O-lators ceased in the middle of the twentieth century. The pots have become collectibles similar to bric-à-brac.

In the 1930s, the German company Melitta produced a series of manual coffee makers called (&quot;coffee filtering machine&quot;). They worked on the principle of French drip coffee pots, but used a paper filter and allowed to pour the whole amount of water at once instead of having to pour several times.

==== Flip coffee pots ====

A less familiar form of drip brewing is the reversible or &quot;flip&quot; pot commonly known as Napoletana (1819) and late-19th century variants like the &quot;Russian reversible pot&quot; aka &quot;Russian egg&quot;, the &quot;reversible Potsdam cafetière&quot; aka &quot;Potsdam boiler&quot;, or the (c. 1920).

====Karlsbad-style coffee makers====

A variant of the category of French drip coffee pots is the group of &quot;Bohemian&quot; coffee pots including the original Karlsbad coffee makers, historically produced by several mostly Bohemian porcelain manufacturers since 1878 up into the first half of the 20th century, and variants produced by Siegmund Paul Meyer (SPM) / Walküre since 1910, Friesland (FPM). In contrast to French drip coffee pots which feature round holes, they all use a special double-layered cross-slitted strainer made from through-glazed porcelain. Before World War I, they were very popular in the Viennese coffee house culture. The special kind of drip coffee they produce is called a (&quot;Karlsbad coffee&quot;).

==== System Büttner coffee makers ====

&quot;System Büttner&quot; coffee makers are a type of coffee makers featuring a special permanent through-glazed porcelain filter with triangularly-arranged slits and a valving mechanism to combine steeping with drip-brewing. They were invented in 1926 by the coffee roaster Carl A. Büttner (Berlin, Germany) and produced up into, at least, the 1940s by the porcelain manufacturer (Weiden, Germany) for various German coffee roasters and distributors.

=== Automatic drip-coffee makers ===

==== Electric drip-coffee makers ====
One of the first electrical drip coffee makers was the German Wigomat, patented in 1954. In the early 1970s electrical drip coffee makers became more common, causing a decline in manual drip coffee preparation methods until the 2010s, and the near-extinction of coffee percolators. Among the early electrical drip coffee machines was a machine designed by two former Westinghouse engineers and sold under the brand Mr. Coffee in the early 1970s.

It normally works by admitting water from a cold-water reservoir into a flexible hose in the base of the reservoir leading directly to a thin metal tube or heating chamber (usually, of aluminium), where a heating element surrounding the metal tube heats the water. The heated water moves through the machine using the thermosiphon principle. Thermally induced pressure and the siphoning effect move the heated water through an insulated rubber or vinyl riser hose, into a spray head, and onto the ground coffee, which is contained in a brew basket mounted below the spray head. The coffee passes through a filter and drips down into the carafe. A one-way valve in the tubing prevents water from siphoning back into the reservoir. The carafe, usually made of glass, rests on a warming plate that keeps the brewed coffee warm. A thermostat attached to the heating element turns off the heating element as needed to prevent overheating the water in the metal tube (overheating would produce only steam in the supply hose), then turns back on when the water cools below a certain threshold. For a standard 10–12 cup drip coffeemaker, using a more powerful thermostatically controlled heating element (in terms of wattage produced), can heat increased amounts of water more quickly using larger heating chambers, generally producing higher average water temperatures at the spray head over the entire brewing cycle. This process can be further improved by changing the aluminium construction of most heating chambers to a metal with superior heat transfer qualities, such as copper.

Throughout the latter part of the 20th century, a number of inventors patented various coffeemaker designs using an automated form of the drip brew method. Subsequent designs have featured changes in heating elements, spray head, and brew-basket design, as well as the addition of timers and clocks for automatic-start, water filtration, filter and carafe design, drip stop, and even built-in coffee grinding mechanisms.

<text>A rotating furnace is a device for making solid objects which have concave surfaces that are segments of axially symmetrical paraboloids. Usually, the objects are made of glass. The furnace makes use of the fact, already known to Newton, that the centrifugal-force-induced shape of the top surface of a spinning liquid is a concave paraboloid, identical to the shape of a reflecting telescope&#x27;s primary focusing mirror.

Paraboloids can be used in various ways, including (after being silvered) as primary mirrors in reflecting telescopes and solar cookers.

==Design==
The furnace includes a mechanism that rotates an open-topped container at constant speed around a vertical axis. A quantity of glass sufficient to make the mirror is placed in the container, heated until it is completely molten, and then allowed to cool while continuing to rotate until it has completely solidified. When the glass is solid, the rotation is stopped and the paraboloidal shape of its top surface is preserved. This process is called spin casting.

The same process can be used to make a lens with a concave paraboloidal surface. The other surface is shaped by the container that holds the molten glass acting as a mold. Lenses made this way are sometimes used as objectives in refracting telescopes.

The axis of rotation becomes the axis of the paraboloid. It is not necessary for this axis to be in the center of the container of glass, or even for it to pass through the container. By placing the container away from the axis, off-axis paraboloidal segments can be cast. This is done in the making of very large telescopes which have mirrors consisting of several segments.

==Mathematical model==
===Rotation speed and focal length===
The focal length of the paraboloid is related to the angular speed at which the liquid is rotated by the equation: formula_1, where formula_2 is the focal length, formula_3 is the rotation speed, and formula_4 is the acceleration due to gravity. On the Earth&#x27;s surface, formula_4 is about 9.81 metres per second-squared, so formula_6 meters per second-squared. Equivalently, as 1 radian per second is about 9.55 rotations per minute (RPM), formula_7, where formula_2 is the focal length in metres, and formula_9 is the rotation speed in RPM.

==Uses==
Generally, a spin-cast paraboloid is not sufficiently accurate to permit its immediate use as a telescope mirror or lens, so it is corrected by computer-controlled grinding machines. The amount of grinding done, and the mass of glass material wasted, are much less than would have been required without spinning.

Spin casting can also be used, often with materials other than glass, to produce prototype paraboloids, such as spotlight reflectors or solar-energy concentrators, which do not need to be as exactly paraboloidal as telescope mirrors. Spin casting every paraboloid that is made would be too slow and costly, so the prototype is simply copied relatively quickly and cheaply and with adequate accuracy.

Liquid-mirror telescopes have rotating mirrors that consist of a liquid metal such as mercury or a low-melting alloy of gallium. These mirrors do not solidify and they are used while liquid and rotating. The rotation shapes them into paraboloids that are accurate enough to be used as primary reflectors in telescopes. Compared with spin-cast glass mirrors which need correction due to the distortions that arise during and after solidification, these mirrors require no such correction.

<doc id="273719" wikidata="Q6890467" url="?curid=273719" title="Mogen David">
<text>Mogen David Wine Co. is a company based in Westfield, New York that makes wines, including the fortified wine MD 20/20. &quot;Mogen David Wine Co.&quot; is a trademark held by their parent company The Wine Group in Livermore, California.

&quot;Mogen David&quot; is the Ashkenazic pronunciation of the Hebrew &quot;Magen David&quot;, which literally means &quot;shield of David&quot;, but is used metaphorically to refer to the six-pointed Star of David.

==Products==
Mogen David wine is sold in 750mL, 1.5L, and 3L bottles. It is also Kosher for Passover.

Mogen David Concord Red wine is made from must of no less than 51% Concord grapes, an American grape variety, which is typically used for grape juices, jellies, and preserves, but also used for Kosher wines. This makes the wine less expensive, averaging $5 per bottle.
In addition to Concord red, Mogen David also markets Blackberry and Pomegranate wines.

==History==
Founded months before the Repeal of Prohibition by Max Cohen and Henry Markus in Chicago, the California Wine Company bottled medicinal and sacramental wines, changing its name to Wine Corporation of America in 1941 when it began making wine from Concord grape juice (or concentrate) shipped from growers in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and later Michigan.

===Chicago winery===
Following World War II the company purchased a building at 3737 South Sacramento Ave in Chicago&#x27;s Brighton Park neighborhood which was converted into one of the largest wineries in the Midwestern United States. The entire winery was allocated to a single product, Mogen David, a kosher wine originally marketed for the Passover Seder that turned out to be popular year-round with the general public. Annual production of Mogen David was in 1946. Wine Corporation of America began advertising Mogen David nationally in 1947; by the early 1950s the advertising budget for Mogen David was the fourth or fifth largest for wines. Max Cohen, company President and founder, noted in 1952 that 98 percent of Mogen David&#x27;s customers were not Jewish.

Annual production of Mogen David increased to more than of wine in 1949 and to nearly for 1953, and in that year Wine Corporation of America took the name of its most important product, becoming the Mogen David Wine Corporation.

In 1955 Mogen David announced the purchase of new plant facilities at 3700 South Kedzie Ave, about from the main plant on Sacramento Ave, designed to triple its capacity and enable production of two additional wines. The company launched a new line of wines under a different brand name, Key, in 1957. This marketing campaign was unsuccessful, and the new line was dropped after three years.

In the early 1960s, concord wine was still the biggest seller in the Mogen David line, along with a rosé, a blackberry wine, a cherry wine and a dry red wine.

Company founder and chairman Max Cohen announced his resignation on 8 January 1962, citing friction with his brother-in-law, Henry A. Markus who was president of the company. Cohen sold all of his stock to Markus, saying that &quot;I am no longer connected with the firm and I have no interest in it.&quot;

The sale of a controlling interest in Mogen David to Richard T. Schofield of Westfield, New York was announced on 9 May 1963, with Schofield taking over as president of the company and Markus appointed chairman. Some operations were moved to Westfield in 1967; Mogen David&#x27;s Westfield winery was closer to the vineyards in the Northeast that grow Concord grapes for its wines, the Chicago plants remained open.

By 1968, Mogen David was producing a dozen different wines and two kinds of champagne. The company broke away from its conventional Mogen David line with the introduction of the MD 20/20 brand of flavored fortified wines that were well received by younger consumers, especially college students. The MD 20/20 line included unusual flavors such as pink grapefruit, wild berry, and Hawaiian blue.

===Acquisition by Coke-New York===
In 1970 the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York was the largest soft drink bottler in the world, having merged with the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New Haven (acquired in 1969) but its growth prospects were limited by the franchise boundaries. When Coke-New York was approached by an investment banking firm to let them know that Mogen David was for sale, they saw an opportunity to become a major competitor in a new industry (Mogen David was the sixth largest winery and the largest Concord grape wine producer in the country) and to pick up a national sales and distribution network. Coke-New York acquired Mogen David on 1 November 1970 by paying $16,750,000 in cash. J. Myron &quot;Mike&quot; Bay was an officer in both companies: President of Mogen David as well as a VP of Coke-New York.

By 1972 Mogen David was producing a day in Westfield, NY and a day from the two plants in Chicago, for an estimated annual output of . Mogen David company introduced a &quot;pop wine&quot; product line, Cold Bear (Concord) and Black Bear (blackberry), leading to overall growth in sales of 32 percent for 1972. Mogen David had a staff of over 45 salesmen. Mogen David wines and Tribuno vermouths were marketed nationally through over 300 independent distributors in 1972, in order to strengthen their market position, New York Coca-Cola began consolidating Tribuno and Mogen David distribution networks.

The Jug line of strawberry and apple pop wines, packaged in country-style brown and white jugs, was introduced in 1973. Mogen David had the fourth largest winery and the third largest advertising budget in the wine industry in 1973 

With its 1973 acquisitions of Tribuno Wines (previously Vermouth Industries of America) and later the well established California winery Franzia, Coke-New York was, in all, the third largest US wine producer. Franzia also shipped wine, grape concentrates and brandy in bulk to the Mogen David winery in Westfield, New York, for use in Mogen David products.

Jerome W. &quot;Jerry&quot; Alder joined Mogen David as President and COO in September 1976; former President Mike Bay moved into the new position of Chairman, and continued as Mogen David&#x27;s CEO. In 1977, the company&#x27;s administrative and marketing offices moved from the original winery at 3737 South Sacramento Ave, and into space in a new building at 444 Michigan Ave in downtown Chicago.

A study of wine marketing in 1980 found that Mogen David consumers apparently had the strongest brand loyalty in the varietal table wine category.

===Acquisition by The Wine Group===
Discussions between The Coca-Cola Company and The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York about a possible acquisition of the latter began in 1974, to little effect.

When merger discussions resumed in 1980, The Coca-Cola Company had already entered the alcoholic beverage market; their Wine Spectrum subsidiary consisting of wineries in California and New York. As part of the proposed merger, The Coca-Cola Company agreed to sell the wine business of Coke-New York to a partnership formed by First Boston and top-level managers of the New York bottler&#x27;s wine business. Coke-New York divested itself of its three wineries, which were bought in 1981 by The Wine Group, a limited partnership headed by Arthur A. Ciocca, to avoid a buyout involving a third party. The Wine Group was the fifth largest wine producer nationally (just behind Coca-Cola&#x27;s Wine Spectrum) for 1981 with sales of nine million cases, the same as the year before.

In 1998, 1.5 million adults were drinking Mogen David, putting it just ahead of its chief competitor Manischewitz. By 2005, Manischewitz was again dominant with more than half of kosher wine sales, Mogen David was second with 33 percent of the market.

<text>The prime minister of Denmark (, , ) is the head of government in the Kingdom of Denmark comprising the three constituent countries: Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Before the creation of the modern office, the kingdom did not initially have a head of government separate from its head of state, namely the monarch, in whom the executive authority was vested. The Constitution of 1849 established a constitutional monarchy by limiting the powers of the monarch and creating the office of . The inaugural holder of the office was Adam Wilhelm Moltke.

The prime minister presides over a cabinet that is formally appointed by the monarch. In practice, the appointment of the prime minister is determined by their support in the Folketing (the National Parliament). Since the beginning of the 20th century, no single party has held a majority in the Folketing so the prime minister must head a coalition of political parties, as well as their own party. Additionally, only four coalition governments since World War II have enjoyed a majority in the Folketing, so the coalitions (and the prime minister) must also gain loose support from other minor parties.

The current prime minister of Denmark is Mette Frederiksen, since 27 June 2019. Since 2022 her cabinet consists of the Social Democrats, Venstre, and the Moderates.

==History==

===Establishment===
From approximately 1699 to 1730, the highest-ranking non-monarchial government official was titled &quot;Grand Chancellor&quot; () and from 1730 until 1848, this office was titled &quot;Minister of State&quot; (). These titles foreshadowed the modern office of prime minister, however, unlike the current office, the grand chancellor and state minister were not formal heads of government. The king held executive authority as absolute ruler from 1661 until the enactment of a liberal Constitution in the early nineteenth century.

The office of prime minister was introduced as a part of the constitutional monarchy outlined in 1848 and signed as the Danish Constitution on 5 June 1849. The new Constitution established a parliamentary system by creating a new bicameral parliament () and a Council Presidium, headed by a council president. The Council Presidium is regarded as the predecessor of the modern Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. The first council president was Adam Wilhelm Moltke, who came to power on 22 March 1848. Molte and his next two successors also held the title of , which translates as &quot;prime minister&quot;.

From 1855 onwards the prime minister was known simply as the &quot;council president&quot; (). Carl Christian Hall became the first prime minister/council president to lead a political party (the National Liberal Party).

===Modern office===
The modern Prime Minister&#x27;s Office was founded on 1 January 1914, when the Council Presidium was established as a department under the prime minister, when it had previously existed as an informal council gathered by the prime minister. The title of the prime minister changed again in 1918 under the premiership of Carl Theodor Zahle, becoming titled &quot;Minister of State&quot; (in-line with its Scandinavian neighbours, Norway and Sweden), which it remains to this day.

By the mid-nineteenth century a strong party-system had developed, with most prime ministers being the leader of either () or Højre (). However, by 1924 the Social Democrats had become the largest party and Højre had disappeared.

During the first years of Occupation of Denmark, the governments of prime ministers Vilhelm Buhl and then Erik Scavenius cooperated with the Nazi occupiers. On 29 August 1943, the Danish government resigned, refusing to grant further concessions to Nazi Germany. All government operations were assumed by the permanent secretaries of the individual departments, and this arrangement lasted until the Liberation of Denmark on 5 May 1945. Since King Christian X never accepted the resignation of the government, it existed de jure until a new cabinet was formed on 5 May 1945.

The twentieth century was dominated by Social Democratic prime ministers leading left-wing coalitions; Social Democratic prime ministers were in power nearly continuously from 1924 until 1982. The first prime minister from the Conservative People&#x27;s Party, Poul Schlüter, came to power as the head of a broad centre-right coalition in 1982. The centre-right coalition rule until 1993, lasting for eleven years, made it the longest centre-right government in Danish history since the 1920s.

In November 2001 the left-wing coalition in the Folketing lost seats to the right-wing coalition led by , ending their eight years rule. became the largest party since 1924. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, leader of , served as the prime minister from 2001 to April 2009. His coalition government consisted of and the Conservative People&#x27;s Party, with parliamentary support from the national-conservative Danish People&#x27;s Party (). On 5 April 2009, Rasmussen resigned to become Secretary General of NATO, leaving minister of finance and vice president of Lars Løkke Rasmussen to be the prime minister.

Following the September 2011 election the right-wing lost by a small margin to the opposing centre-left coalition, led by Helle Thorning-Schmidt who on 3 October 2011 formed a new government initially consisting of the Social Democrats, the Danish Social Liberal Party and the Socialist People&#x27;s Party. Following a general election defeat, in June 2015 Thorning-Schmidt resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Lars Løkke Rasmussen, who headed a minority government consisting entirely of ministers from .

The Social Democrats returned to power after the 2019 election, with Mette Frederiksen assuming the role of prime minister.

==Role and authority==

The Constitution of Denmark states that the monarch, who is the head of state, has supreme authority and acts out this power through their ministers. However, the modern role of the Monarch is symbolic only. The monarch formally appoints and dismisses ministers, including the prime minister. However, any action of the monarch requires a countersignature from a minister. It is also a principle in Danish constitutional literature that &quot;the power follows the responsibility&quot; (), and the monarch being free from responsibility means they have no genuine power. In the case of appointing ministers, it is the signature of the prime minister. This means that the power to appoint ministers practically lies entirely with the prime minister and not the monarch. 

Although the country&#x27;s leading politician, the prime minister is not nearly as powerful as other prime ministers in Europe. This is mainly because it is nearly impossible for one party to get a majority of seats in the Folketing (Parliament), so the government is always either a coalition or a one-party minority government. No Danish party has won a majority since 1901, and for much of that time there has not even been a majority coalition. Because of their limited powers, the prime minister is &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (first among equals). Additionally, unlike most of their counterparts, Danish prime ministers can never be certain that their agenda will pass, and must cobble together a majority for each piece of legislation.

Although, as stated, the monarch formally appoints all ministers of the cabinet freely according to the constitution, in practice monarchs only conventionally select the prime minister after a leader has gathered support from a majority in the Folketing. This has been the case since parliamentarianism became the convention after the Easter Crisis in 1920. Parliamentarianism was added to the constitution in 1953 with section 15. Today, it means that the monarch on the responsibility of the resigning prime minister cannot appoint a new prime minister which they expect will be met with a successful vote of no confidence. With no party having held a majority in over a century, parties form alliances. Usually, the Social Democrats join with centre-left parties, and Venstre with centre-right parties. Following elections when there is no clear leader, the monarch will hold a &quot;king/queen&#x27;s meeting&quot; where, after a series of discussions and agreements, the leader of the largest alliance and the largest party within that alliance—usually the Social Democrats or Venstre- is appointed as prime minister-&quot;elect&quot; (, &quot;royal investigator/examiner&quot;). The new prime minister-elect, together with the leaders of the junior parties, select ministers to form a new coalition cabinet, which is the presented to the monarch. The government is allowed to take office without a vote of confidence, and is allowed to stay in office as long as it does not lose a vote of no confidence.

The prime minister chairs the weekly meetings of the cabinet meetings and has the power to set the agenda of these meetings. The prime minister traditionally gathers together a government ministry known as the &quot;Ministry of the State of Denmark&quot; () or Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. Atypical of a Danish ministry it does not have any councils, boards or committees associated with it and its near sole responsibility is to act as the secretariat of the prime minister. There is a small department under the ministry that takes care of special legal issues not covered under other ministries, among others Greenland&#x27;s and the Faroe Islands&#x27; relation to the monarchy, the mass media&#x27;s contact to the state, the number of ministers in the government, or Queen Margrethe II&#x27;s legal status as a civilian.

The prime minister has the power to choose to dissolve the Folketing and call a new election (although this is formally undertaken by the monarch), which the prime minister is obligated to do within four years of the previous election. In spite of this, the prime minister has no say with respect to Denmark&#x27;s autonomous regions, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, while the Folketing on the other hand does, as all laws passed by the Faroese and Greenlandic parliaments must be ratified by the Folketing.

There are checks on the prime minister&#x27;s power. If the Folketing revokes its confidence in an incumbent prime minister, the prime minister must either resign along with the entire cabinet or call a new election. Whenever a prime minister resigns, dies, or is forced from office, the monarch asks them (or, in the case of death, the next available leader in a coalition) to keep the government as a caretaker government until a successor has been elected.

==Amenities==
The government offices, including the Ministry of the State of Denmark (; The Prime Minister&#x27;s Office), is located inside Christiansborg Palace, along with the Folketing and the courts.

The official summer residence of the prime minister is Marienborg, an eighteenth-century estate that was acquired by the state. It is situated on the shore of Lake Bagsværd in Kgs. Lyngby, north of Copenhagen. It has served as an official summer residence for ten prime ministers since 1960. Marienborg is frequently used for governmental conferences and informal summits between the government, industry and organisations in Denmark.

<doc id="273726" wikidata="Q3058109" url="?curid=273726" title="Prime Minister of the Netherlands">
<text>The prime minister of the Netherlands () is the head of the executive branch of the Government of the Netherlands. Although the monarch is the &quot;de jure&quot; head of government, the prime minister &quot;de facto&quot; occupies this role as the officeholder chairs the Council of Ministers and coordinates its policy with the rest of the cabinet. In his role as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of government, the prime minister also represents the Netherlands in the European Council. Forty-three incumbents have served in the position. The current prime minister, Dick Schoof, has been in the position since 2 July 2024, with his cabinet being sworn in on the same day.

== History ==
Gradually the prime minister became an official function of government leader, taken by the political leader of the largest party. Since 1845, the role of the first minister is relevant. In that year the Constitution of the Netherlands was amended to make ministers responsible to the States General and no longer responsible to the king, who acted as the leader of cabinet. Until 1901, the position chair of the Council of Ministers officially rotated between ministers. Between 1901 and 1945, the position formally still rotated, but prominent politicians could claim a rotation period of four years.

In 1937, a separate Ministry of General Affairs was instituted, which was informally linked to the prime minister. Barend Biesheuvel (1971–1974) was the last prime minister who was not the political leader of the largest party in cabinet (his was actually the third largest), until the appointment of Dick Schoof (2024-present) who is an independent politician chosen to lead the right wing coalition. In 1983 the function of prime minister was laid down in the constitution.

The position of the prime minister has been reinforced by the creation of the European Council. In November 2006, the rules of procedure of the council of ministers was changed to allow the prime minister to put any item on the agenda of the council and no longer have to wait for a minister to take the initiative. A change of the rules of procedure of the cabinet in July 2008 allowed the prime minister to manage costs of the Royal House across departments, to make one department in control of cost of the Royal House which are covered by several ministries.

== Role ==
Although the prime minister is the leading Dutch political figure and holder of the &quot;de facto&quot; highest office, they are not as powerful as, for example, the British prime minister or the German chancellor. This is mainly because, historically, all Dutch ministers used to be responsible to the monarch (also true of prime ministers in other countries); ministers took turns to fill the position of prime minister, and in the role had little if any control over the other ministers. The prime minister&#x27;s role gained importance when ministers became responsible to the parliament, and the position became mostly reserved for the leader of the biggest political party in the House of Representatives. Still, because the position holds limited powers compared to its equivalent in other neighboring parliamentary democracies, the prime minister&#x27;s role is described as &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (&quot;first among equals&quot;).
Following the constitutional review of 1983, the position of prime minister was formalised in the Dutch Constitution for the first time. According to the Constitution of the Netherlands, the Government is constituted by the king and the ministers. The Constitution stipulates that the prime minister chairs the Council of Ministers (article 45) and is appointed by royal decree (article 43). The royal decree of their own appointment and those of the other ministers are to be countersigned by the prime minister (article 48). The Council of Ministers is no longer attended by the king.

The prime minister chairs the weekly meetings of the Council of Ministers and has the power to set the agenda of these meetings. The prime minister is also Minister of General Affairs (&quot;Minister van Algemene Zaken&quot;), which takes an important role in coordinating policy and is responsible for the Government Information Service (Dutch: &quot;Rijksvoorlichtingsdienst&quot;).

The prime minister is also responsible for the royal house and has a weekly meeting with the king on government policy. Informally the prime minister functions as the &quot;face&quot; of the cabinet to the public. After the meetings of the cabinet on Friday, the prime minister hosts a press conference on the decisions of the cabinet and current affairs. The prime minister also has some functions in international affairs, attending the European Council every six months and maintaining bilateral contacts. The prime minister&#x27;s office has since the 1980s been an octagonal tower, named &quot;The Little Tower&quot; (Torentje), in the Binnenhof in The Hague. The official residence (which is only used for official functions) is the Catshuis; the last prime minister to live in the Catshuis was Dries van Agt. During his tenure, Mark Rutte lived in a flat in downtown The Hague. The prime minister has a security detail and which, in 2021, was increased amid fears of kidnapping.

Although prime ministers are almost always the political leader of their party and as such chosen as a member of the House of Representatives, they (and other ministers who were chosen as representative) are required to give up their seat for the duration of their tenure, as Dutch ministers are not allowed to be members of parliament.

=== Appointment ===
The Dutch electoral system makes it all but impossible for one party to win an outright majority in the House of Representatives; no party has done so since 1900. Hence, Dutch governments are always coalitions between two or more parties. Following the most recent elections, the House appointed a &quot;scout&quot; to seek advice on how to interpret the election results (a role coordinated by the monarch prior to 2012). On the basis of this advice, the House appoints an &quot;informateur&quot; to check on prospective coalitions and lead negotiations between potential partners. If successful, the House then appoints a &quot;formateur,&quot; who concludes the talks between the members of the prospective coalition. The &quot;formateur&quot; is almost always the leader of the largest party in the prospective coalition, and thus &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister-designate. Prior to 2012, the monarch had a considerable role in this process in particular during the initial phases and the appointment of informateurs and formateurs. Reforms in 2012 pulled these tasks to the House of Representatives, thus largely eliminated royal influence on the process.

It usually takes several months of negotiations before a &quot;formateur&quot; is ready to accept a formal royal invitation to form a government. The monarch then appoints the ministers and state secretaries (junior ministers), who then resign their seats in the House or other job if appointed without being a representative.

The second largest coalition parties usually provides the senior Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands. If there are more parties in the coalition, generally they also each appoint one of their ministers to deputy prime ministers.

=== Deputies ===

The king appoints deputy prime ministers. Conventionally, all of the junior partners in the coalition get one deputy prime minister; they are ranked according to the size of their respective parties. The senior deputy present chairs the cabinet meeting when the prime minister is not present. In the current Schoof cabinet, Fleur Agema chairs those meetings as first deputy prime minister of the Netherlands, with the other deputies being Sophie Hermans, Eddy van Hijum, and Mona Keijzer. The oldest member of the cabinet chairs the meeting when the prime minister and all deputies are absent.

=== Kingdom of the Netherlands ===
The prime minister is also chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and therefore also deals with matters affecting the other countries Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten in the kingdom. The independent cabinets of Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten also have their own prime ministers: Evelyn Wever-Croes (Prime Minister of Aruba), Gilmar Pisas (Prime Minister of Curaçao), and Luc Mercelina (Prime Minister of Sint Maarten). The Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of the Netherlands includes ministers plenipotentiary from the other countries of the kingdom. These are not included in the government of the kingdom.

<doc id="273741" wikidata="Q796897" url="?curid=273741" title="Prime Minister of Italy">
<text>The prime minister of Italy, officially the President of the Council of Ministers (), is the head of government of the Italian Republic. The office of president of the Council of Ministers is established by articles 92–96 of the Constitution of Italy; the president of the Council of Ministers is appointed by the president of the Republic and must have the confidence of the Parliament to stay in office.

Prior to the establishment of the Italian Republic, the position was called President of the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom of Italy (&quot;Presidente del Consiglio dei ministri del Regno d&#x27;Italia&quot;). From 1925 to 1943 during the Fascist regime, the position was transformed into the dictatorial position of Head of the Government, Prime Minister, Secretary of State (&quot;Capo del Governo, Primo Ministro, Segretario di Stato&quot;) held by Benito Mussolini, Duce of Fascism, who officially governed on the behalf of the king of Italy. King Victor Emmanuel III removed Mussolini from office in 1943 and the position was restored with Marshal Pietro Badoglio becoming prime minister in 1943, although the original denomination of President of the Council was only restored in 1944, when Ivanoe Bonomi was appointed to the post of prime minister. Alcide De Gasperi became the first prime minister of the Italian Republic in 1946.

The prime minister is the president of the Council of Ministers which holds executive power and the position is similar to those in most other parliamentary systems. The formal Italian order of precedence lists the office as being, ceremonially, the fourth-highest Italian state office after the president and the presiding officers of the two houses of parliament. In practice, the prime minister is the country&#x27;s political leader and &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive.

Giorgia Meloni has been the incumbent prime minister since 22 October 2022.

== Functions ==
As the president of the Council of Ministers, the prime minister is required by the Constitution to have the supreme confidence of the majority of the voting members of the Parliament.

In addition to powers inherent in being a member of the Cabinet, the prime minister holds specific powers, most notably being able to nominate a list of Cabinet ministers to be appointed by the president of the Republic and the countersigning of all legislative instruments having the force of law that are signed by the president of the Republic.

Article 95 of the Italian constitution provides that the prime minister &quot;directs and coordinates the activity of the ministers&quot;. This power has been used to a quite variable extent in the history of the Italian state as it is strongly influenced by the political strength of individual ministers and thus by the parties they represent.

The prime minister&#x27;s activity has often consisted of mediating between the various parties in the majority coalition, rather than directing the activity of the Council of Ministers. The prime minister&#x27;s supervisory power is further limited by the lack of any formal authority to fire ministers. In the past, in order to make a cabinet reshuffle, prime ministers have sometimes resigned so that they could be re-appointed by the president and allowed to form a new cabinet with new ministers. In order to do this the prime minister needs the support of the president, who could theoretically refuse to re-appoint them following their resignation.

== History ==

The office was first established in 1848 in Italy&#x27;s predecessor state, the Kingdom of Sardinia—although it was not mentioned in its constitution, the Albertine Statute.

=== Historical Right and Historical Left ===

After the unification of Italy and the establishment of the kingdom, the procedure did not change. In fact, the candidate for office was appointed by the king and presided over a very unstable political system. The first prime minister was Camillo Benso di Cavour, who was appointed on 23 March 1861, but he died on 6 June the same year. From 1861 to 1911, Historical Right and Historical Left prime ministers alternatively governed the country.

According to the letter of the Statuto Albertino, the prime minister and other ministers were politically responsible to the king and legally responsible to Parliament. With time, it became all but impossible for a king to appoint a government entirely of his own choosing or keep it in office against the will of Parliament. As a result, in practice the prime minister was now both politically and legally responsible to Parliament, and had to maintain its confidence to stay in office.

One of the most famous and influential prime ministers of this period was Francesco Crispi, a left-wing patriot and statesman, the first head of the government from Southern Italy. He led the country for six years from 1887 until 1891 and again from 1893 until 1896. Crispi was internationally famous and often mentioned along with world statesmen such as Otto von Bismarck, William Ewart Gladstone and Salisbury.

Originally an enlightened Italian patriot and democrat liberal, Crispi went on to become a bellicose authoritarian prime minister, ally and admirer of Bismarck. His career ended amid controversy and failure due to becoming involved in a major banking scandal and subsequently fell from power in 1896 after a devastating colonial defeat in Ethiopia. He is often seen as a precursor of the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.

=== Giolittian Era ===

In 1892, Giovanni Giolitti, a leftist lawyer and politician, was appointed prime minister by King Umberto I, but after less than a year he was forced to resign and Crispi returned to power. In 1903, he was appointed again head of the government after a period of instability. Giolitti was prime minister five times between 1892 and 1921 and the second-longest serving prime minister in Italian history.

Giolitti was a master in the political art of &quot;trasformismo&quot;, the method of making a flexible, fluid centrist coalition in Parliament which sought to isolate the extremes of the left and the right in Italian politics. Under his influence, the Italian Liberals did not develop as a structured party. They were instead a series of informal personal groupings with no formal links to political constituencies.

The period between the start of the 20th century and the start of World War I, when he was prime minister and Minister of the Interior from 1901 to 1914 with only brief interruptions, is often called the Giolittian Era. A left-wing liberal with strong ethical concerns, Giolitti&#x27;s periods in the office were notable for the passage of a wide range of progressive social reforms which improved the living standards of ordinary Italians, together with the enactment of several policies of government intervention.

Besides putting in place several tariffs, subsidies and government projects, Giolitti also nationalized the private telephone and railroad operators. Liberal proponents of free trade criticized the &quot;Giolittian System&quot;, although Giolitti himself saw the development of the national economy as essential in the production of wealth.

=== Fascist regime ===
The Italian prime minister presided over a very unstable political system as in its first sixty years of existence (1861–1921) Italy changed its head of the government 37 times.

Regarding this situation, the first goal of Benito Mussolini, appointed in 1922, was to abolish the Parliament&#x27;s ability to put him to a vote of no confidence, basing his power on the will of the King and the National Fascist Party alone. After destroying all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his Fascist followers consolidated their power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years, he had established dictatorial authority by both legal and extraordinary means, aspiring to create a totalitarian state. In 1925 the title of &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot; was changed into &quot;Head of the Government, Prime Minister Secretary of State&quot;, symbolizing the new dictatorial powers of Mussolini. The convention that the prime minister was responsible to Parliament had become so entrenched that Mussolini had to pass a law stating that he was not responsible to Parliament.

Mussolini remained in power until he was deposed by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1943 following a vote of no confidence by the Grand Council of Fascism and replaced by General Pietro Badoglio. A few months later, Italy was invaded by Nazi Germany and Mussolini was reinstated as head of a puppet State called Italian Social Republic, while the authorities of the Kingdom were forced to relocate in Southern Italy, which was under the control of the Allied Forces. 

In 1944 Badoglio resigned and Ivanoe Bonomi was appointed to the post of prime minister, restoring the old title of &quot;President of the Council of Ministers. Bonomi was briefly succeeded by Ferruccio Parri in 1945 and then by Alcide de Gasperi, leader of the newly formed Christian Democracy (&quot;Democrazia Cristiana&quot;, DC) political party.

=== First decades of the Italian Republic ===

Following the 1946 Italian institutional referendum, the monarchy was abolished and De Gasperi became the first Prime Minister of the Italian Republic. The First Republic was dominated by the Christian Democracy which was the senior party in each government coalitions from 1946 to 1994 while the opposition was led by the Italian Communist Party (PCI), the largest one in Western Europe.
In the first years of the Republic, the governments were led by De Gasperi, who is also considered a founding father of the European Union.

After the death of De Gasperi, Italy returned in a period of political instability and a lot of cabinets were formed in few decades. The second part of the 20th century was dominated by De Gasperi&#x27;s protégé Giulio Andreotti, who was appointed prime minister seven times from 1972 to 1992.

From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the Years of Lead, a period characterised by economic crisis (especially after the 1973 oil crisis), widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups, with the alleged involvement of United States and Soviet intelligence. The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democrat leader Aldo Moro in 1978 and the Bologna railway station massacre in 1980, where 85 people died.

In the 1980s, for the first time since 1945 two governments were led by non-Christian Democrat prime ministers: one Republican (Giovanni Spadolini) and one Socialist (Bettino Craxi). However, the Christian Democrats remained the main government party. During Craxi&#x27;s government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world&#x27;s fifth-largest industrial nation, gaining entry into the Group of Seven, but as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the GDP.

In the early 1990s, Italy faced significant challenges as voters—disenchanted with political paralysis, massive public debt and the extensive corruption system (known as &quot;Tangentopoli&quot;) uncovered by the &quot;Clean Hands&quot; (&quot;mani pulite&quot;) investigation—demanded radical reforms. The scandals involved all major parties, but especially those in the government coalition: the Christian Democrats, who ruled for almost 50 years, underwent a severe crisis and eventually disbanded, splitting up into several factions. Moreover, the Communist Party was reorganised as a social-democratic force, the Democratic Party of the Left.

=== The &quot;Second Republic&quot; ===

In the midst of the &quot;mani pulite&quot; operation which shook political parties in 1994, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, owner of three private TV channels, founded (Forward Italy) party and won the elections, becoming one of Italy&#x27;s most important political and economic figures for the next decade. Berlusconi is also the longest-serving prime minister in the history of the Italian Republic and the third-longest serving in the whole history after Mussolini and Giolitti.

Ousted after a few months of government, Berlusconi returned to power in 2001, lost the 2006 general election five years later to Romano Prodi and his Union coalition, but won the 2008 general election and was elected prime minister for the third time in May 2008. In November 2011, Berlusconi lost his majority in the Chamber of Deputies and resigned. His successor, Mario Monti, formed a new government, composed of &quot;technicians&quot; and supported by both the center-left and the center-right. In April 2013, after the general election in February, the Vice Secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) Enrico Letta led a government composed by both center-left and the center-right.

On 22 February 2014, after tensions in the Democratic Party the PD&#x27;s Secretary Matteo Renzi was sworn in as the new prime minister. Renzi proposed several reforms, including a radical overhaul of the Senate and a new electoral law. However, the proposed reforms were rejected on 4 December 2016 by a referendum. Following the referendum&#x27;s results, Renzi resigned and his Foreign Affairs Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed new prime minister.
On 1 June 2018, after the 2018 Italian general election where the anti-establishment Five Star Movement become the largest party in Parliament, Giuseppe Conte (leader of Five Star) was sworn in as prime minister, at the head of a populist coalition of Five Star Movement and the League.

After the 2019 European Parliament election in Italy, where the League exceeded Five Star Movement, Matteo Salvini (leader of the League) proposed a no-confidence vote in Conte. Conte resigned, but after the consultations between the President Sergio Mattarella and the political parties, Conte was reappointed as prime minister, heading a government of the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party of Nicola Zingaretti.

In January 2021, the centrist party Italia Viva, led by former prime minister Renzi, withdrew its support to Conte&#x27;s government. In February 2021, President Mattarella appointed Mario Draghi, former President of the European Central Bank, Prime Minister. His new cabinet was supported by most Italian parties, including the League, M5S, PD, and FI.

In October 2022, President Mattarella appointed Giorgia Meloni as Italy&#x27;s first female prime minister, following the resignation of Mario Draghi amidst a government crisis and a general election.

<text>A trading card (or collectible card) is a small card, usually made out of paperboard or thick paper, which usually contains an image of a certain person, place or thing (fictional or real) and a short description of the picture, along with other text (attacks, statistics, or trivia). When traded separately, they are known as singles. There is a wide variation of different types of cards.

Trading cards are traditionally associated with sports (baseball cards are particularly common) but can also include subjects such as &quot;Pokémon&quot; and other non-sports trading cards. These often feature cartoons, comic book characters, television series and film stills. In the 1990s, cards designed specifically for playing games became popular enough to develop into a distinct category, collectible card games. These games are mostly fantasy-based gameplay. Fantasy art cards are a subgenre of trading cards that focus on the artwork.

==History==

=== Origins ===
Trade cards are the ancestors of cigarette and food (bubble gum) cards. Some of the earliest prizes found in retail products were cigarette cards; trade cards were designed to advertise products that were inserted into paper packs of cigarettes as stiffeners to protect the contents. Allen and Ginter in the U.S. in 1886, and British company W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills in 1888, were the first tobacco companies to print advertisements. A couple of years later, lithograph pictures on the cards with an encyclopedic variety of topics from nature to war to sports—subjects that appealed to men who smoked—began to surface as well. By 1900, there were thousands of tobacco card sets manufactured by 300 different companies. Children would stand outside of stores to ask customers who bought cigarettes for the promotional cards. Following the success of cigarette cards, trade cards were produced by manufacturers of other products and included in the product or handed to the customer by the store clerk at the time of purchase. World War II put an end to cigarette card production due to limited paper resources, and after the war cigarette cards never really made a comeback. After that collectors of prizes from retail products took to collecting tea cards in the UK and bubble gum cards in the US.

=== Early baseball cards ===
The first baseball cards were trade cards printed in the late 1860s by a sporting goods company, around the time baseball became a professional sport. Most of the baseball cards around the beginning of the 20th century came in candy and tobacco products. It was during this era that the most valuable baseball card ever printed, the T206 tobacco card featuring Honus Wagner, was produced. The T206 set, distributed by the American Tobacco Company in 1909, is considered by collectors to be the most popular set of all time. In 1933, the Goudey Gum Company of Boston issued baseball cards with players biographies on the backs and was the first to put baseball cards in bubble gum. The 1933 Goudey set remains one of the most popular and affordable vintage sets to this day. Bowman Gum of Philadelphia issued its first baseball cards in 1948.

=== Modern trading cards ===
Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., now known as &quot;The Topps Company, Inc.&quot;, started inserting trading cards into bubble gum packs in 1950 with such topics as TV and film cowboy Hopalong Cassidy, Frank Buck from &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Back Alive&quot; on big game hunts in Africa, and All-American Football Cards. Topps produced its first baseball trading card set in 1951, with the resulting design resembling that of playing cards. Topps owner and founder Sy Berger created the first true modern baseball card set, complete with playing record and statistics, the following year in the form of 1952 Topps Baseball. This is one of the most popular sets of all time; its most valued piece was 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle #311, which is sometimes erroneously referred to as Mantle&#x27;s rookie card, though he had in fact appeared in the 1951 Bowman Baseball set. On August 28, 2022, a Mickey Mantle baseball card (Topps; #311; SGC MT 9.5) was sold for $12.600 million.

Topps purchased their chief competitor, Bowman Gum, in 1956. Topps was the leader in the trading card industry from 1956 to 1980, not only in sports cards but in entertainment cards as well. Many of the top selling non-sports cards were produced by Topps, including Wacky Packages (1967, 1973–1977), &quot;Star Wars&quot; (beginning in 1977) and Garbage Pail Kids (beginning in 1985). In 1991, Topps ceased packaging gum with their baseball cards, which many collectors preferred because their cards could no longer be damaged by gum stains. The following year, in 1992, Topps ceased using heavily waxed paper to wrap their packs of cards and began using cellophane plastic exclusively, thus eliminating the possibility of wax stains on the top and bottom cards in the packs.

=== Digital trading cards ===
In an attempt to stay current with technology and digital trends, existing and new trading card companies started to create digital trading cards that lived exclusively online or as a digital counterpart of a physical card.

In 1995 Michael A. Pace produced &quot;computer based&quot; trading cards, utilizing a CD ROM computer system and floppy discs.

In 2000, Topps launched a brand of sports cards, called etopps. These cards were sold exclusively online through individual IPO&#x27;s (initial player offering) in which the card is offered for usually a week at the IPO price. That same year, Tokenzone launched a digital collectibles platform that was used by media companies to distribute content in the form of digital trading cards. The quantity sold depended on how many people offered to buy but was limited to a certain maximum. After a sale, the cards were held in a climate-controlled warehouse unless the buyer requests delivery, and the cards could be traded online without changing hands except in the virtual sense. In January 2012, Topps announced that they would be discontinuing their eTopps product line.

Digital collectible card games were estimated to be a $1.3B market in 2013. A number of tech start-ups have attempted to establish themselves in this space, notably Stampii (Spain, 2009), Fantom (Ireland, 2011), Deckdaq (Israel, 2011), and 2Stic (Austria, 2013).

Panini launched their Adrenalyn XL platform with an NBA and NFL trading card collection. Connect2Media together with Winning Moves, created an iPhone Application to host a series of trading card collections, including Dinosaurs, James Bond - 007, Celebs, Gum Ball 3000, European Football Stars and NBA. In 2011, mytcg Technologies launched a platform for hosting digital trading card content.

On July 1, 2011, Wildcat Intellectual Property Holdings filed a lawsuit against 12 defendants, including Topps, Panini, Sony, Electronic Arts, Konami, Pokémon, Zynga and Nintendo, for allegedly infringing Wildcat&#x27;s &quot;Electronic Trading Card&quot; patent.

In 2012, Topps also launched their first phone application: Topps Bunt was an app that allowed users to connect with other fans in a fantasy league type game environment wherein they could collect players, earn points from playing, and trade and compete with other fans. Three years later, the same company launched a digital experiment in Europe (geotargeted to exclude the USA) with its Marvel Hero Attax, using digital as an overlay to its physical product.

==Value==
Today, the development of the Internet has given rise to various online communities, through which members can trade collectible cards with each other. Cards are often bought and sold via eBay and other online retail sources. Many websites solicit their own &quot;sell to us&quot; page in hopes to draw in more purchase opportunities.

Singles are usually of higher value than contemporary cards which are often sold as &quot;bulk&quot; or as a personal collection. Ordinary collectible cards serve little function beyond memorabilia, but cards from collectible card games (CCGs) are also used in game tournaments. Generally, CCGs fetch higher initial prices than trading cards because of the dual nature of being both a game piece and a collectible. Prices will fluctuate for CCGs as cards become legal or illegal to play in certain game formats.

The value of a trading card depends on a combination of the card&#x27;s condition, the subject&#x27;s popularity, and the scarcity of the card. In some cases, especially with older cards that preceded the advent of card collecting as a widespread hobby, they have become collectors&#x27; items of considerable value. In recent years, many sports cards have not necessarily appreciated as much in value due to overproduction, although some manufacturers have used limited editions and smaller print runs to boost value. Trading cards, however, do not have an absolute monetary value. Cards are only worth as much as a collector is willing to pay.

Valued at $44 billion today, the global sports trading card market is expected to surge to approximately $100 billion by 2027.

===Condition===
Card condition is one aspect of trading cards that determine the value of a card. There are four areas of interest in determining a card&#x27;s condition. Centering, corners, edges and surface are taken into consideration for imperfections, such as color spots and blurred images, and wear, such as creases, scratches, and tears, when determining a trading card&#x27;s value. Cards are considered poor to pristine based on their condition, or in some cases rated 1 through 10. A card in pristine condition, for example, will generally be valued higher than a card in poor condition. Major card grading companies which provide these ratings on a scale of 1-10 include PSA, Beckett, and SGC. They provide individual grades for the centering, corners, edges, and surface of the card to eventually combine for one final grade. Older cards are generally more sensitive to wear and tear, meaning a &#x27;7&#x27; might lessen the value of a card printed in 2018, but could significantly increase the value of a card from 1950. While the grade has a major impact on the card&#x27;s value, the population does as well. For example, there are over 20,000 Luka Doncic 2018 Base Prizm Cards graded a PSA 10, meaning this large population drives down the value of each card. 

===Popularity===
Popularity of trading cards is determined by the subject represented on the card, their real life accomplishments, and short term news coverage, as well as the specifics of the card.

===Scarcity===
While vintage cards are truly a scarce commodity, modern-day manufacturers have to artificially add value to their products in order to make them scarce. This is accomplished by including serial-numbered parallel sets, cards with game-worn memorabilia and more. Time can also make cards more scarce due to the fact that cards may be lost or destroyed.

Some singles have been autographed by someone related to the card. The person who autographed the card may be depicted, or their artwork is visible on the card. Cards may also be autographed by the card designer or by a person famous for using that card. The value of an autographed card has been debated, often depending on who has autographed it or the scarcity of the autograph. In some cases, an autograph can be seen as damage to the card, or graffiti.

==Collecting==
It is often said that for someone playing a CCG, the best way to obtain the cards they desire is not via booster packs, but by buying the individual singles they need for their deck. Purchasing booster packs is often seen as a form of gambling, because buyers do not know which cards they will receive until after their purchase. Even though the price for an individual card may be more than the price of booster pack, they will likely save money in the long run, compared to buying multiple booster packs at greater cost in hopes of randomly getting it.

== Catalogs ==
Trading card catalogs are available both online and offline for enthusiast. They are mainly used as an educational tool and to identify cards. Online catalogs also contain additional resources for collection management and communication between collectors.

==Terminology==

==Sports cards==
Sports card is a generic term for a trading card with a sports-related subject, as opposed to non-sports trading cards that deal with other topics. Sports cards were among the earliest forms of collectibles. They typically consist of a picture of a player on one side, with statistics or other information on the reverse. Cards have been produced featuring most major sports, especially those played in North America, including, but not limited to, American football, association football (soccer), baseball, basketball, boxing, golf, ice hockey, racing and tennis.

The first set with a sporting theme appeared in 1896, a cricket series by W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills of 50 cricketers. The tobacco companies soon realised that sports cards were a great way to obtain brand loyalty. In 1896 the first association football set, &quot;Footballers &amp; Club Colours&quot;, was published by Marcus &amp; Company, a small firm in Manchester. Other football sets issued at that time were &quot;Footballers &amp; Club Colours&quot; (Kinner, 1898); &quot;Footballers&quot; (J. F. Bell, 1902); &quot;Footballers&quot; (F. J. Smith, 1902) and &quot;Footballers&quot; (Percy E. Cadle, 1904).

The first stage in the development of sports cards, during the second half of the 19th century, is essentially the story of baseball cards, since baseball was the first sport to become widely professionalized. Hockey cards also began to appear early in the 20th century. Cards from this period are commonly known as cigarette cards or tobacco cards, because many were produced by tobacco companies and inserted into cigarette packages, to stiffen cigarette packaging and advertise cigarette brands. One of the most expensive cards in the hobby is a cigarette card of Honus Wagner in a set called 1909 T-206. The story told is that Wagner was against his cards being inserted into something that children would collect. So the production of his cards stopped abruptly. It is assumed that less than 100 of his cards exist in this set. The 1909 T-206 Honus Wagner card has sold for as much as $2.8 million. More recently, on August 28, 2022, a Mickey Mantle baseball card (Topps; #311; SGC MT 9.5) was sold for $12.600 million.

Sets of cards are issued with each season for major professional sports. Since companies typically must pay players for the right to use their images, the vast majority of sports cards feature professional athletes. Amateurs appear only rarely, usually on cards produced or authorized by the institution they compete for, such as a college.

Many older sports cards (pre-1980) command a high price today; this is because they are hard to find, especially in good quality condition. This happened because many children used to place their cards in bicycle spokes, where the cards were easily damaged. Rookie cards of Hall of Fame sports stars can command thousands of dollars if they have been relatively well-preserved.

In the 1980s, sports cards started to get produced in higher numbers, and collectors started to keep their cards in better condition as they became increasingly aware of their potential investment value. This trend continued well into the 1990s. This practice caused many of the cards manufactured during this era to stay low in value, due to their high numbers.

The proliferation of cards saturated the market, and by the late 1990s, card companies began to produce scarcer versions of cards to keep many collectors interested. The latest trends in the hobby have been &quot;game used memorabilia&quot; cards, which usually feature a piece of a player&#x27;s jersey worn in a real professional game; other memorabilia cards include pieces of bats, balls, hats, helmets, and floors. Authenticated autographs are also popular, as are &quot;serially numbered&quot; cards, which are produced in much smaller amounts than regular &quot;base set cards&quot;.

Autographs obtained by card manufacturers have become the most collected baseball cards in the hobby&#x27;s history. This started in 1990 in baseball when Upper Deck randomly inserted autographs of Reggie Jackson into boxes. They are commonly referred to as &quot;Certified Autographed Inserts&quot; or &quot;CAI&#x27;s&quot;. Both the athlete&#x27;s and card company&#x27;s reputations are on the line if they do not personally sign these cards. This has created the most authentic autographs in existence. These cards all have some form of printed statements that the autographs are authentic, this way, no matter who owns the autograph there is no question of its authenticity. CAI&#x27;s have branched out into autographs of famous actors, musicians, presidents, and even Albert Einstein. Mostly these autographs are cut from flat items such as postcards, index cards, and plain paper. Then they are pasted onto cards. In 2001, a company called Playoff started obtaining autographs on stickers that are stuck on the cards instead of them actually signing the cards. There is strong opposition against these types of autographs because the players never even saw the cards that the stickers were affixed to.

===Association football===
The first association football (or &quot;soccer&quot;) cards were produced in 1898 by the Marcus &amp; Company Tobacco in Manchester, England. The set consisted of over 100 cards and was issued under the title of &quot;Club Colours&quot;. They featured illustrated images of players on the front of the card, and a tobacco advertisement on the back of the card. Many other cigarette companies quickly created their own series, beginning with Kinner in 1898. A later series of cards was produced in 1934 by Ardath, which was a 50-card set called &quot;Famous Footballers&quot; featuring images of players on the front of the card, and a tobacco advertisement and short biography of the player on the back of the card.

Modern association football trading cards were sold with bubble gum in the United Kingdom from 1958 to 1975 by A&amp;BC, and later by Topps, UK from 1975 to 1981. Similar smaller sized cards were issued in Spain and Italy beginning in the late 1940s. Cards have been produced from 1981 to present, save 1985 and 1986. Under its &quot;Merlin&quot; brand, since 1994 Topps has held the licence to produce stickers for the Premier League sticker album. Launched by Topps in the 2007–08 season, Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK – with around 1.5m collectors in the UK – and with global sales it is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.
Other variations of football products exist, such as marbles, cut-outs, coins, stamps and stickers, some made of light cardboard and attached with glue or stickers, into sticker albums specifically issued for the products. Forming a partnership with FIFA in 1970, Panini first produced a World Cup sticker album for the 1970 World Cup. Initiating a craze for collecting and trading stickers, since then, it has become part of the World Cup experience, especially for the younger generation. &quot;The Guardian&quot; states, “the tradition of swapping duplicate [World Cup] stickers was a playground fixture during the 1970s and 1980s.” Panini begins assembling World Cup squads for their sticker album a few months before they are officially announced by each nation, which means surprise call ups often don’t feature in their album. A notable example of this was 17-year-old Brazilian striker Ronaldo who was called up for the Brazil squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

Panini’s football trading card game Adrenalyn XL was introduced in 2009. In 2010 Panini released a UEFA Champions League edition of Adrenalyn XL, containing 350 cards from 22 of the competing clubs, including defending champions FC Barcelona. The fourth edition of Panini FIFA 365 Adrenalyn XL was released for 2019, featuring top clubs, teams and players.

In 2022, Indonesian manufacturer FanGir established a partnership with PT Liga Indonesia Baru to introduce the inaugural BRI Liga 1 trading card collection.

=== Australian rules football ===
Australian rules football cards are almost exclusively found in Australia as no top-level leagues are present outside the country. The first Australian rules football cards were produced in conjunction with Goodwin &amp; Co&#x27;s Old Judge Cigarettes in the late 1880s. In the set were Australian celebrities which included Australian rules footballers from Victoria and South Australia. Other companies that issued earlier football cards were W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills in 1905, and Sniders &amp; Abrahams (featuring scenes of matches in 1908 and then releasing other sets with portraits of football players in the 1910s, all in full color). In the 1930s, the Australian division of British Godfrey Phillips Co. released a set of football cards. By the same time, Hoadleys, a local confectionery company, released a set of illustrated cards. Another confectionery company, Clarke-Ellis, also released its own set of cards. Other companies that launched cards sets in the 1930s were Pals Periodical, Plaistowe &amp; Co., Carreras (two illustrated sets in 1933, the first of them with footballers caricatures by Bob Miram), Giant Licorice Cigarettes, MacRobertson&#x27;s and W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills, among others. The most popular set of Australian rules football cards are often the considered to be the 1963 Scanlens card set. Select Australia is currently the longest continuously operating and largest producer of Australian rules football cards. Prices for Australian rules football cards can be relatively high compared to other sporting codes in Australia. This is illustrated for both vintage and modern cards, such as an 1894 American Tobacco Company card featuring Essendon player Will Crebbin which sold for $10,110 in 2018 and a 2004 Select AFL Conquest Triple Brownlow Medallist signature card featuring Nathan Buckley, Adam Goodes and Mark Ricciuto which was valued at $3,000 in 2018.

===Baseball===
Baseball cards will usually feature one or more baseball players or other baseball-related sports figures. The front of the card typically displays an image of the player with identifying information, including, but not limited to, the player&#x27;s name and team affiliation. The reverse of most modern cards displays statistics and/or biographical information. Cards are most often found in the United States; however, they are also common in countries such as Canada, Cuba, and Japan, where baseball is a popular sport and there are professional leagues.

The earliest baseball cards were in the form of trade cards produced in 1868. They evolved into tobacco cards by 1886. In the early 20th century, other industries began printing their own version of baseball cards to promote their products, such as bakery/bread cards, caramel cards, dairy cards, game cards and publication cards. Between the 1930s and 1960s, the cards developed into trading cards, becoming their own product. In 1957, Topps changed the dimensions of its cards slightly, to 2-1/2 inches by 3-1/2 inches, setting a standard that remains the basic format for most sports cards produced in the United States.

In 2005, the long-standing sports card producer Fleer went bankrupt and was bought out by Upper Deck. Not long after that, Donruss lost its MLB license. Since 2009, Topps has held exclusive rights to produce MLB-licensed baseball cards.

===Basketball===
Basketball cards feature one or more players of the NBA, NCAA, Olympic basketball, WNBA, WBL, or some other basketball-related theme. The first basketball cards were produced in 1910, in a series cataloged as &quot;College Athlete Felts B-33&quot;. The complete series included ten different sports, with only 30 cards being associated with basketball. The cards were issued as a cigarette redemption premium by Egyptiene Cigarettes. The number of cigarette packages needed to redeem for the tobacco cards is not known.

The next series of basketball cards were issued in 1911, in two separate series; &quot;T6 College Series&quot;, measuring approximately 6&quot; by 8&quot;, and &quot;T51 College Series&quot;, measuring approximately 2&quot; by 3&quot;. These series included a variety of sports, with only 4 cards being associated with basketball, one card from the T6 series and three cards from the T51 series. Both series were produced in two variations, one variation reading &quot;College Series&quot;, the other, &quot;2nd Series&quot;. The cards were acquired in trade for fifteen Murad cigarette coupons. The offer expired June 30, 1911.

Basketball cards were not seen again until 1932, when C.A. Briggs Chocolate issued a 31-card set containing multiple sports. In exchange for a completed set of cards, Briggs offered baseball equipment. The number of basketball cards in the set is not known.

===Boxing===
One of the first boxing cards on record in &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Boxing Cards&quot; and encyclopedia and check-list of boxing cards, was of John C. Heenan issued by photographs Charles D. Fredericks in the 1860s. The first set of boxer cards was issued by Goodwin &amp; Company in 1886. Other companies, including Duke and Sons and the Lorillard Tobacco Company, also issued boxing cards in this period. American company Allen &amp; Ginter issued several boxing cards in the &quot;World Champions&quot; series, among other sportsmen.

After the World War II, other companies took over the manufacturing of boxing cards, such as Leaf (1948), Topps (1951) and Donruss.

More recently, Upper Deck released several boxing series. 

In March 2023, Indonesian trading card manufacturer, FanGir, released their debut &quot;Legacy&quot; collection that featured Indonesian Boxing Legends Chris John and Daud Yordan. The collection includes a standout item: the Chris John Autographed Card 1/1 Red Foil. Notably, this card achieved a groundbreaking sale at an auction, fetching IDR 6,900,000 and attaining the distinction of being the most valuable Indonesian Trading Card at that time.

===Cricket===
Cricket cards usually feature one or more players or a cricket-related theme. One of the first cricket collections was released by tobacco company W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills in 1896. Other companies that released cricket collections were Australian Sniders &amp; Abrahams in 1905, and Capstan (a Wills brand) in 1909–10. Alexander Boguslavsky Ltd. also released an illustrated sports collection (that included cricket) in 1925.

In modern times, cricket cards have been produced by Futera (1993–98) and Topps.

===Cycling===
Panini released collections of some of the most famous bicycle races in Europe, such as the Tour de France and the Giro d&#x27;Italia.

===Gridiron football===

A gridiron football card is a type of collectible trading card typically printed on paper stock or card stock that features one or more American football, Canadian football or World League of American Football players or other related sports figures. These cards are most often found in the United States and Canada where the sport is popular.

Most football cards features National Football League players. There are also Canadian Football League and college football cards. Player cards normally list the player&#x27;s statistics.

===Golf===
Golf cards will usually feature one or more golf players or a golf-related theme. Golf cards were first introduced in 1901 by Ogden.

===Horse racing===
Horse racing cards will usually feature jockeys or an equestrian related theme.

===Ice hockey===
The first hockey cards were included in cigarette packages from 1910 to 1913. After World War I, only one more cigarette set was issued, during the 1924–25 season by Champ&#x27;s Cigarettes. NHL player Billy Coutu&#x27;s biography includes an example of one of the 40 cards issued at that time.

During the 1920s, some hockey cards were printed by food and candy companies, such as Paulin&#x27;s Candy, Maple Crispette, Crescent, Holland Creameries and La Patrie.

Through 1941, O-Pee-Chee printed hockey cards, stopping production for World War II. Presumably, the 1941 involvement of the US in the war affected the hockey card market, since Canada had been in the war since 1939.

Hockey cards next appeared during 1951–52, issued by Shirriff Desserts, York Peanut Butter and Post Cereal. Toronto&#x27;s Parkhurst Products Company began printing cards in 1951, followed by Brooklyn&#x27;s Topps Chewing Gum in 1954–1955. O-Pee-Chee and Topps did not produce cards in 1955 or 1956, but returned for 1957–58. Shirriff also issued &quot;hockey coins.&quot;

===Lacrosse===
Lacrosse cards will usually feature one or more lacrosse players or another lacrosse-related theme.

===Netball===
With the Suncorp Super Netball competition in Australia Tap&#x27;n&#x27;Play decided to enter the Netball trading card market. In 2018 they produced their first very basic release but in 2019 they produced a release full of colour and signature cards.

===Racing===
Racing cards consist of a card stock with stats and pictures on it. Sometimes it shows the car, sometimes it shows the driver&#x27;s face, and sometimes both. It also shows the endorsing companies for the car.

In September 2020, it was announced that Topps had signed an exclusive worldwide agreement to become the Official Sticker and Trading Card Licensee of Formula 1.

===Rugby League ===

Rugby League cards were first produced in England in 1895. Initially these were produced as part of a multi-sport series. Early in the 1920s, the first dedicated Rugby League series was produced, featuring star players from the Northern Union, as the English based Rugby Football League was then known. These were followed shortly after by cards produced in Australia, New Zealand, and Wales. Rugby League trading cards are popular in Australia, with sets having been produced annually since 1968. These sets primarily featured players from the Sydney based New South Wales Rugby Football League, with some sets also being produced featuring players from the Brisbane based Queensland Rugby League. In 1988 the New South Wales Rugby League expanded to become a de facto national league, and the cards were branded accordingly as &quot;Australian Rugby League&quot; cards in 1995, and &quot;National Rugby League&quot; cards in 1998.

===Rugby Union ===
Rugby Union cards have been produced since the 1880s. However, production has been sporadic, with limited interest post-1940.

===Surfing===
In 1993 Futera trading card company produced its first surfing trading card release Hot Surf with a similar release following in 1994 and 1995. These are the only three surfing trading card releases for the Australian market.

Upper Deck has also produced surfing trading cards as a part of its annual Goodwins champion release and World of Sport series.

===Sumo===
Sumo cards consist of sports cards that feature one or more sumo wrestlers (sumoists) or another sumo-related theme.

===Tennis===
From the early 1900s through to the 1980s several companies produced tennis trading cards as part of general sports card promotional release or exclusive tennis card release. One of these being W.A. &amp; A.C. Churchman tobacco company Men of the Moment in sport release of 1936. They also produced an exclusive lawn tennis release in 1928.

In 1983, Robinson&#x27;s Barley Water produced a Sporting Records series. These cards featured many tennis superstars of the era, like Billie Jean King.

In 1986 Panini trading cards produced a Supersport series featuring tennis trading cards.

In 1996, the Intrepid trading card company produced the only Australian market tennis trading card release, &quot;Blitz&quot;.

Supersisters was a set of 72 trading cards produced and distributed in the United States in 1979 by Supersisters, Inc, featuring famous women from politics, media and entertainment, culture, and other areas of achievement. The cards were designed in response to the trading cards popular among children in the US at the time which mostly featured men.

<doc id="273754" wikidata="Q2741486" url="?curid=273754" title="Chief Executive of Hong Kong">
<text>The chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is the representative of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and head of the Government of Hong Kong.

The position was created to replace the office of Governor of Hong Kong, the representative of the Monarch of the United Kingdom during British colonial rule. The office, as stipulated by the Hong Kong Basic Law, formally came into being on 1 July 1997 with the handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The chief executive is head of the executive branch of the Hong Kong government.

The functions of the chief executive include nominating principal officials for appointment by the State Council of China, which is headed by the premier, conducting foreign relations, appointing judges and other public officers, giving consent to legislation passed by the Legislative Council, and bestowing honours. The Basic Law grants the chief executive a wide range of powers, but obliges him or her, before making important policy decisions, introducing bills to the Legislative Council, making subsidiary legislation, and dissolving the Legislative Council, to act only after consultation with the Executive Council (all of whose members are the CE&#x27;s own appointees). The executive council consists of official and non-official members, including the Chief Secretary for Administration, the most senior official and head of the Government Secretariat, in charge of overseeing the administration of the Government.

The Chief Executive holds the title &quot;The Honourable&quot;, and ranks first in the Hong Kong order of precedence. The official residence of the chief executive is Government House in Central, Hong Kong Island.

The current chief executive is John Lee selected as chief executive in the 2022 election, appointed by the Chinese State Council with the designation decree signed by Premier Li Keqiang on 30 May 2022 and took office on 1 July 2022. Lee is the fifth chief executive of Hong Kong; each of his four predecessors are still living.

== Eligibility for office ==
According to article 44 of the Basic Law, the chief executive must be a Chinese citizen as defined by the HKSAR Passports Ordinance. The individual must be at least 40 years old, a Hong Kong permanent resident who is a Chinese citizen with right of abode in Hong Kong, and has ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than 20 years. Article 47 further requires that the chief executive be a person of integrity, dedicated to his or her duties. In addition, candidates are ineligible to stand for selection by the Election Committee without first obtaining nominations from one eighth of its total members.

==Selection==

The specific method for selecting the chief executive is prescribed in Annex I of the Basic Law. The Election Committee shall be composed of 1500 members from the following sectors pursuant to the amended Annex I under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes initiated by the National People&#x27;s Congress. The Election Committee consists of individuals (i.e. private citizens) and representatives of bodies (i.e. special interest groups or corporate bodies) selected or elected by 40 prescribed sub-sectors as stipulated in Annex I to the Basic Law.

===Election Committee===

The Election Committee is responsible for the nomination of chief executive candidates and election of the chief executive-elect. Under the 2021 Hong Kong electoral changes initiated by the National People&#x27;s Congress, each candidate running for chief executive elections is to be nominated by at least 188 members of the Election Committee, before their eligibility is reviewed and confirmed by the Candidate Eligibility Review Committee of the HKSAR. The chief executive-designate is then returned by the Election Committee with an absolute majority.

The Election Committee is now principally elected by body voters. The number of subsectors with individual votes were significantly reduced, together with elimination of mixed individual and body voting:
* Half of seats (150 seats) in Sector III are nominated by members of national professional organisations or filled by ex officio members;
* District Council subsectors were replaced by subsectors consisting of government-appointed representatives of members of Area Committees, District Fight Crime Committees, and District Fire Safety Committees;
* All NPC and CPPCC sectors serve as ex officio EC members; and
* subsectors consisting of grassroot organisations, associations of Chinese Fellow Townsmen, associations of Hong Kong residents in Mainland and Hong Kong members of relevant national organisations were introduced.

===Chief Executive elections===
Chief Executive candidates must receive nominations by at least 188 members of the Election Committee, with nomination by at least 15 members of each sector of the Election Committee. Candidacy is confirmed upon review and confirmation of eligibility by the Candidate Qualification Review Committee, according to opinions issued by the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the basis of a review by the National Security Department of the Hong Kong Police Force on whether a candidate meets the legal requirements and conditions of upholding the Basic Law and swearing allegiance to the HKSAR of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The Chief Executive-designate is then returned by the Election Committee with an absolute majority in a two-round system:
The chief executive-designate must publicly disaffiliate with a political party within seven days of the election and must not become a member of a party during their term of office. The chief executive-designate is then appointed by the Central People&#x27;s Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China before taking office.

===Electoral reform===
In the first selection of the chief executive, the committee consisted of only 400 members. It was expanded to 800 for the second term. As a result of enabling legislation stemming from a public consultation in 2010, and its approval by the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee in Beijing, the number of representatives was increased from 800 to 1200. Following the electoral reform initiated by the Chinese government in 2021 to increase mainland-Chinese controls on Hong Kong, the number of representatives was increased to 1500 but most are appointed or ex-officio seats.

===Term===
According to article 46 the term of office of the chief executive is five years with a maximum of two consecutive terms. If a vacancy occurs mid-term, the new Chief Executive&#x27;s first term is for the remainder of the previous Chief Executive&#x27;s term only. The method of selecting the chief executive is provided under Article 45 and Annex I of the Basic Law, and the Chief Executive Election Ordinance.

==Term of office==

===Duties and powers===
Under the Basic Law the chief executive is the chief representative of the people of Hong Kong and is the head of the government of Hong Kong. The Chief Executive&#x27;s powers and functions include leading the government, implementing the law, signing bills and budgets passed by the Legislative Council, deciding on government policies, advising appointment and dismissal of principal officials of the Government of Hong Kong to the Central People&#x27;s Government of China, appointing judges and holders of certain public offices and to pardon or commute sentences. The position is also responsible for the policy address made to the public.

The chief executive&#x27;s powers and functions are established by article 48 of the Basic Law.

The Executive Council of Hong Kong is an organ for assisting the chief executive in policy-making. The council is consulted before making important policy decisions, introducing bills to the Legislative Council, making subordinate legislation or dissolving the Legislative Council.

===Resignation===
Article 52 of the Basic Law stipulates that the Chief Executive must resign when:
*the Chief Executive loses the ability to discharge his or her duties as a result of serious illness or other reasons;
*the Chief Executive refuses to sign a bill passed by a two-thirds majority of a re-elected Legislative Council, after the Legislative Council is dissolved; or
*the Legislative Council refuses to pass the budget or any other important bill for a second time after the Legislative Council is dissolved.

===Impeachment===
The Legislative Council has the power to propose a motion of impeachment of the chief executive for decision by the Central People&#x27;s Government of China, with the following steps as stipulated in article 73(9) of the Basic Law:

* One-fourth of all Legislative Council (LegCo) members can jointly initiate a motion, charging the chief executive with serious breach of law or dereliction of duty;
* the motion for investigation passed by simple majority of votes of each of the two groups of members present;
* the Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal is mandated to form and chair an independent investigation committee for carrying out the investigation and reporting its findings to LegCo;
* the independent investigation committee considers the evidence sufficient to substantiate such charges;
* a two-thirds majority of all LegCo members passes the motion of impeachment;
* the motion of impeachment is reported to the Central People&#x27;s Government of China for decision.

===Acting and succession===
The acting and succession line is spelled out in article 53. If the chief executive is not able to discharge his or her duties for short periods (such as during overseas visits), the duties would be assumed by the chief secretary for administration, the financial secretary or the secretary for justice, by rotation, in that order, as acting chief executive. In case the position becomes vacant, a new chief executive would have to be selected.

===Residence and office===

Prior to the handover in 1997, the office of the chief executive-designate was at the seventh floor of the Asia Pacific Finance Tower. When Tung Chee-hwa assumed duty on 1 July 1997, the office of the chief executive was located at the fifth floor of the Former Central Government Offices (Main Wing). In the past the governor had his office at Government House. Tung did not use Government House as the primary residence because he lived at his own residence at Grenville House. Donald Tsang decided to return to the renovated Government House during his first term, and moved in on 12 January 2006, for both his office and residence. In 2011, the office of the chief executive moved to the low block of the new Central Government Complex in Tamar. Government House continues to serve as the official residence of the Chief Executive.

Upon retirement, former Chief Executives have access to office space at the Office of Former Chief Executives, 28 Kennedy Road. The office provides administrative support to former Chief Executives to perform promotional, protocol-related, or any other activities in relation to their former official role. The activities include receiving visiting dignitaries and delegations, giving local and overseas media interviews, and taking part in speaking engagements. A chauffeur-driven car is provided to discharge promotional and protocol-related functions.

Depending on police risk assessment, personal security protection is provided. Former Chief Executives also enjoy medical and dental care.

Former Chief Executives hold the title &quot;The Honourable&quot;, and ranks third in the Hong Kong order of precedence.

==Remuneration==
Remuneration for the chief executive of Hong Kong is among the highest in the world for a political leader, and only second to that of the prime minister of Singapore. The pay level took a cue from the handsome amounts paid to the city&#x27;s colonial governors – worth $273,000 per annum plus perks in 1992.

In 2005, Tung Chee Hwa received some HK$3 million ($378,500) in pay as Chief Executive. From 2009 until the end of 2014, the salary for the job stood at HK$4.22 million. In January 2015, Leung Chun-Ying reversed a pay freeze imposed in 2012, resulting in its increase to HK$4.61 million ($591,000).

In July 2017, directors of bureaux (DoBs) were approved to have a 12.4% pay rise and the 3.5% pay differential between secretaries of departments (SoDs) and DoBs remained, indicating a new annual pay of approximately HK$5 million for the city&#x27;s leading role because the Chief Executive received a salary of 112% of the Chief Secretary. The new salary of Chief Executive of Hong Kong is about thirty-nine times more than the annual salary of President of China.

== Criticism of the office ==
Since the chief executive is directly appointed by the Central People&#x27;s Government of China after an election by a committee of 1,500 people selected by the Chinese Government, rather than the general population, many people, in particular the pro-democrats, have criticised the office as undemocratic, and have criticised the entire election process as a &quot;small-circle election.&quot; Former chief executive Tung Chee-hwa has even stated that the election&#x27;s result is a non-binding one, saying that the Chinese government would refuse to appoint the winning candidate if that person was unacceptable to them.

Many events, including the Five Constituencies Referendum in 2010, Umbrella Revolution in 2014 and Anti-Extradition Movement during 2019–20, have attempted to push for greater democracy and universal suffrage.

In January 2015, when Leung Chun-Ying reversed a pay freeze imposed on the chief executive and senior civil servants in 2012, he was accused of granting himself a pay rise by stealth and going against the trend of top politicians taking pay cuts instead of pay increases.

In July 2021, Carrie Lam refused to remove the legal immunity of the chief executive in anti-bribery legislation, stating that the officeholder has to be accountable to the Beijing government and hence, extending such provisions to CE would &#x27;sabotage its superior constitutional status&#x27;. She was accused of positioning herself above the law whilst going against the principles of separation of power and rule of law.

<text>The governor of Hong Kong was the representative of the British Crown in Hong Kong from 1843 to 1997. In this capacity, the governor was president of the Executive Council and commander-in-chief of the British Forces Overseas Hong Kong. The governor&#x27;s roles were defined in the Hong Kong Letters Patent and Royal Instructions. Upon the end of British rule and the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, most of the civil functions of this office went to the chief executive of Hong Kong, and military functions went to the commander of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison.

== The governor ==
Authorities and duties of the governor were defined in the Hong Kong Letters Patent and Royal Instructions in 1843. The governor, appointed by the British monarch (on the advice of the Foreign Secretary), exercised the executive branch of the government of Hong Kong throughout British sovereignty and, with the exception of a brief experiment after World War II, no serious attempt was made to introduce representative government, until the final years of British rule.

The governor of Hong Kong chaired the colonial cabinet, the Executive Council (ExCo), and, until 1993, was also the president of the Legislative Council. The governor appointed most, if not all, of the members of the colony&#x27;s legislature (known colloquially as LegCo), which was largely an advisory body until the first indirect election to LegCo was held in 1985. Initially, both councils were dominated by British expatriates, but this progressively gave way to local Hong Kong Chinese appointees in later years. Historically, the governors of Hong Kong were either professional diplomats or senior colonial officials, except for the last governor, Chris Patten, who was a career politician. 
In December 1996, the governor&#x27;s salary was HK$3,036,000 per annum, tax-free. It was fixed at 125% of the chief secretary&#x27;s salary.

In the absence of the governor, the chief secretary immediately became the acting governor of the colony. The chief secretaries were historically drawn from the Colonial Office or British military. One Royal Navy Vice Admiral served as administrator after World War II. Four Japanese military officers (three Army officers and one naval vice admiral) served as administrators during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong in World War II.

== Transport ==
The governor of Hong Kong used a Daimler DS420 for day to day transport and a Rolls-Royce Phantom V landaulet for ceremonial occasions. Both vehicles were removed by the Royal Navy immediately following the handover to China on 1 July 1997.

== Residences ==
* The first governor, Sir Henry Pottinger, 1st Bt., resided at the site of the now Former French Mission Building from 1843 to 1846. It was used as the home of the Provisional Government after Japanese surrender from 1945 to 1946. The building now houses the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal. His successor, Sir John Davis, 1st Bt., also lived there before moving to Caine Road.
* Since the 4th governor, Sir John Bowring, the governors resided at Government House, excluding the period from 1941 to 1946.
* From 1941 to 1945 the Commandant of Japanese Forces as Military Governor of Hong Kong occupied Flagstaff House as their residence. The residence was returned to the Commander of British Forces following the end of World War II.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1986]] in [[Afghanistan]].

==Incumbents==
* General Secretary of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan: Babrak Karmal (until 4 May), Mohammad Najibullah (starting 4 May)
* Chairman of the Revolutionary Council: Babrak Karmal (until 24 November), Haji Mohammad Chamkani (starting 24 November)
* Chairman of the Council of Ministers: Sultan Ali Keshtmand

==Events==
Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev announces that soviet troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 1988. The withdrawal of troops begins on October 15. Gorbachev&#x27;s offer is made from Siberia and is part of a much wider Soviet initiative in Asia. The withdrawal brings sharp reactions: the U.S. dismisses it as &quot;inadequate&quot; and suggests it is no more than a normal rotation of troops; Afghan resistance groups reject it as a &quot;bluff,&quot; while Pakistan sees it as a small but positive move. Strategic analysts say the withdrawal has no military significance since three of the six units are air-defense regiments and the Afghan resistance has no air capability. The regiments constitute only a little over 6% of an estimated 120,000 Soviet troops in Afghanistan. The war continues unabated, with many clashes between Soviet-backed Afghan troops and the resistance. Claims of success are made by both sides, but they are impossible to verify. A number of major offensives are launched during the year. Toward the end of 1986, the resistance fighters begin to receive more and better weapons from the outside world - particularly from the United States, the United Kingdom, and China - via Pakistan, the most important of these being shoulder-fired ground-to-air missiles. The Soviet and Afghan air forces then begin to suffer considerable casualties.

===February 1986===
A report by the U.S. State Department states that the war has resulted in &quot;one of the greatest mass migrations in history&quot; and that Kabul&#x27;s population has more than doubled to two million. &quot;More than five million have been uprooted, nearly four million of them becoming refugees abroad ... In large areas of the countryside where resistance is active, wartime conditions and longstanding animosities among competing tribal groups have led to multiple taxation, arbitrary detention, and outright banditry.&quot; The resistance shoots down several military aircraft in Herat province; the reported death toll is 200.

===April 1986===
700 resistance fighters are killed in Paktia province.

===May, July, and August 1986===
Karmal resigns as general secretary of the PDPA, retaining the less important position of Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. The resignation is officially attributed to reasons of health - he has made no public appearance since March 30 and is reported to have been in the U.S.S.R. for medical treatment. It is widely thought, however, that the Soviet leadership is dissatisfied with his performance and wants to create a broader power base. His successor, new general secretary Mohammad Najibullah, was formerly head of Khad, the country&#x27;s secret police, and more recently took charge of security.

Government troops clash with resistance soldiers in Badakhshan province, leaving 200 Soviet-Afghan soldiers and &quot;dozens&quot; of resistance soldiers dead. Also in July 120 government troops died during an ambush on a military convoy in Zabol province.

A massive explosion destroys an ammunition dump in the headquarters of the Afghan Army&#x27;s 8th Division near Kabul, reportedly killing up to 100 people.

For the fifth consecutive year, UN-sponsored talks are held in Geneva between Afghanistan and Pakistan with the object of ending the military presence in Kabul. None of the meetings produce any concrete results, though differences between the two countries have narrowed since the talks began in 1982. Discussions continue through diplomatic channels, and in December a UN spokesman announces that agreement has been reached on the monitoring of Soviet troop withdrawals. The remaining stumbling block is the timetable for a total withdrawal, with Pakistan insisting that this should take place as soon as technically feasible.

===September 1986===
A national reconciliation campaign is approved by the Politburo, including a unilateral six-month cease-fire to begin on January 15, 1987, but it meets with little response inside Afghanistan and is rejected by resistance leaders in Pakistan.

===November 1986===
A UN human rights report reports that 10,000 to 12,000 Afghan civilians have been killed in the previous nine months by Soviet and Afghan government forces, and that children have been killed by the indiscriminate use of explosives disguised as toys. The &quot;continuation of the military solution,&quot; the report says, &quot;will lead to a situation approaching genocide.&quot; The same month the UN General Assembly passes a resolution, by a vote of 122 to 20, calling for a negotiated settlement to the war. Karmal resigns from the largely ceremonial post of Chairman of the Revolutionary Council. He is succeeded on November 24 by Haji Mohammad Chamkani, formerly first vice-chairman and a non-PDPA member.

===December 1986===
An extraordinary plenum of the PDPA Central Committee approves a policy of national reconciliation, involving negotiations with opposition groups, and the proposed formation of a coalition government of national unity. A cabinet reshuffle sees the elevation of Najibullah supporters Abdul Wakil and Mohammad Rafi to the posts of foreign minister and defense minister, respectively. Najibullah visits the U.S.S.R. to discuss prospects for ending the conflict in Afghanistan.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1981]] in [[Afghanistan]].

The stalemate in the Afghan crisis continues throughout the year. Babrak Karmal&#x27;s government rejects negotiations except on its own terms, and the Soviets show no desire to withdraw or reduce their military presence. Rebel resistance against the Soviet presence intensifies throughout the country, despite all-out efforts by the 85,000-strong Soviet force and the Afghan Army to curb it. There are reports of widespread fighting between the &quot;Mujahideen&quot; (Islamic guerrillas) and the security forces in vast areas stretching from Kandahar in the south to Badakhshan on the Soviet border. The presence of rebels brings reprisals from the Soviet forces, and helicopter gunship and artillery attacks devastate several villages. Although there are no official estimates, Soviet casualties are also believed to be heavy. Although Pakistan denies the allegation, there is said to be evidence of a regular arms flow to the &quot;Mujahideen&quot; inside Afghanistan from across the border. During this year, the country and the USSR made a trade agreement for 1981 to 1985. Afghanistan shall provide the USSR with food, natural gas and raw materials while the USSR will provide machinery and industrial materials.

==Incumbents==
* General Secretary of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan: Babrak Karmal
* Chairman of the Revolutionary Council: Babrak Karmal
* Chairman of the Council of Ministers: Babrak Karmal (until 11 June), Sultan Ali Keshtmand (starting 11 June)

==February 1981==
Karmal visits Moscow, where he signs a series of agreements, mainly economic, with Soviet leaders. The Afghan economy is moving further and further into the orbit of the Soviet bloc, which takes most of its exports in return for food grains and consumer goods.

==March 1981==
According to UN statistics, 1.7 million Afghans have so far fled to Pakistan and some 400,000 to Iran in order to escape the strife in their country.

==June 1981==
General Secretary Karmal gives up the post of prime minister; he is succeeded in that position on June 11 by Sultan Ali Keshtmand, another trusted member of the Parcham faction of the PDPA. Keshtmand is also put in direct charge of the National Patriotic Front, set up in December 1980 with the intention of rallying the people behind Karmal&#x27;s Marxist revolutionary government.

==August 25, 1981==
Karmal announces a new set of proposals for negotiations with Pakistan and Iran, either separately or together; this is a slight departure from proposals he made in May and in December 1980. The democratic revolutionary government of Afghanistan, he says, will be prepared to hold tripartite talks with Pakistan and Iran under the aegis of UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim or his representative. The government wants a political settlement that would ensure &quot;a full and reliable end to armed and other interference from outside into Afghanistan&#x27;s internal affairs, and the creation of conditions under which such interference would be excluded in future.&quot; The Soviet troops could withdraw if such international guarantees were given and implemented. Iran, itself going through a period of internal chaos, reacts negatively to the Kabul proposal, while Pakistan at first considers it &quot;flexible&quot; and later rejects it. Pakistan maintains its earlier stand that any direct negotiation with a representative of the Karmal government would amount to recognition of the regime, contrary to the ruling of the Islamic Conference.

==September 1981==
During the General Assembly session, UN Secretary-General Waldheim and Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, UN special representative for Afghanistan, have separate discussions with the Afghan Foreign Minister Shah Mohammad Dost and Pakistan&#x27;s Foreign Minister Agha Shahi. Efforts to bring the two parties together with or without the presence of a UN representative do not succeed, though it is agreed that Pérez de Cuéllar will continue his mediation efforts. The New York meetings are a consequence of a November 1980 General Assembly resolution that called for withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and appealed to all parties to create conditions for a political solution.

<doc id="273766" wikidata="Q2632251" url="?curid=273766" title="Increase Mather">
<text>Increase Mather (; June 21, 1639 Old Style – August 23, 1723 Old Style) was a New England Puritan clergyman in the Massachusetts Bay Colony and president of Harvard College for twenty years (1681–1701). He was influential in the administration of the colony during a time that coincided with the notorious Salem witch trials.

==Early life and education==
The New England Mathers originally came from the parish of Winwick near Liverpool, in Lancashire, England. Increase Mather was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts Bay Colony, on June 21, 1639, to the Rev. Richard Mather and Kathrine Holt Mather, following their participation in the Great Migration from England due to their nonconformity to the Church of England.

The stated reason for his first name was &quot;…the never-to-be-forgotten , of every sort, wherewith God favoured the country about the time of his nativity.&quot; The name &quot;Increase&quot; is a literal translation of the Hebrew &quot;Yosëf&quot; (Joseph). He was the youngest of six brothers, the others being Samuel, Nathaniel, Eleazar, Joseph, and Timothy. The first three of these also became ministers.

In 1651, Mather was admitted to Harvard College, where he roomed with and studied under Robert Massey. In 1656, aged 17, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree and began to train for the ministry, giving his first sermon on his 18th birthday. He quickly left Massachusetts and went to Ireland, where he studied at Trinity College, Dublin, for a Master of Arts degree. During his time at Trinity College he was licensed as a Commonwealth Minister by Oliver Cromwell to the joint charge of St Tida&#x27;s Church, Ballyscullion, and St Swithan&#x27;s Church, Magherafelt. He graduated in 1658.

==Career==
After graduation, Mather worked as a chaplain attached to a garrison in the Channel Islands from 1659 to 1661 with a short stint at a church in Gloucester in 1660.

After Cromwell&#x27;s death in 1658, Mather felt less secure in his post in the Channel Islands due to Charles II&#x27;s return to the throne. He resigned the position in 1660 and sailed for Boston in 1661. Harvard later awarded Mather the first honorary degree in the New World; he became a Doctor of Sacred Theology in 1692.

===North Church===

In 1661, with the advent of the English Restoration and resurgence of Anglicanism, Increase returned to Massachusetts Bay Colony, where he married Maria Cotton. She was his step-sister by virtue of his father&#x27;s marriage to Sarah Hankredge, widow of John Cotton and mother of Maria. Maria gave birth to Cotton Mather in 1663. In 1676, Increase published &quot;A Brief History of the War with the Indians in New-England&quot;, a contemporary account of King Philip&#x27;s War.

Mather was ordained as minister of the North Church. He held this post until he died.

On November 27, 1676, Mather&#x27;s home, the meeting house, and a total of 45 buildings in Boston&#x27;s North End were destroyed by a fire. The meeting house was rebuilt soon afterwards, and the Paul Revere House was later constructed on the site of the Mather House.

===Harvard College===
Increase Mather was President of Harvard from 1681 until 1701, although his official title at the college varied. On June 11, 1685, he was made Acting President. On July 23, 1686, he was appointed Rector. On June 27, 1692, he finished writing the new college charter and became president. On September 5, 1692, while the Salem trials were still ongoing, Increase Mather was awarded a doctorate of divinity, the first doctorate issued at Harvard, and the last for 79 years.

Mather was rarely present on campus or in the town, especially during his term of Rector, as he was out of the Colony for all but two years of his term in that office. Despite his absences he did make some changes: re-implementation of Greek and Hebrew instruction, replacement of classical Roman authors with Biblical and Christian authors in ethics classes, enactment of requirements that students attend classes regularly, live and eat on campus, and that seniors not haze other students.

===Politics===
While politics and Puritan religion were closely related during Increase&#x27;s lifetime, his first direct involvement with politics occurred as a result of James II of England&#x27;s manipulation of the New England governments. In 1686, James revoked the Charter of Massachusetts in the process of creating the Dominion of New England.

The Dominion was headed by Edmund Andros, who not only disliked puritanism and was haughty, but ruled as a near-absolute dictator: Town meetings were outlawed, leaving the Dominion without consent of the governed, marriage was removed from the clergy, and the Old South Church was temporarily appropriated for Anglican services.

The 1687 Declaration of Indulgence, prohibiting discrimination against Catholics, saw staunch opposition from the Puritan establishment. When Mather successfully roused opposition to revocation of the charter, he was nearly framed for treason. He traveled to London (eluding spies out to catch him) to petition the King. While engaged in petitioning he published pieces to build popular support for his positions, such as &quot;A Narrative of the Miseries of New-England, By Reason of an Arbitrary Government Erected there Under Sir Edmund Andros&quot; (1688) and &quot;A Brief Relation for the Confirmation of Charter Privileges&quot; (1691).

He attempted to restore the old charter and obtain a royal charter for Harvard; however, he abandoned that course and changed his petitions, favoring a new charter not lacking any of the rights previously granted. Following the Glorious Revolution and subsequent overthrow of Andros, a new charter was granted to the colony. The 1692 charter was a major departure from its predecessor, granting sweeping home rule, establishing an elective legislature, enfranchising all freeholders (previously only men admitted to a congregation could vote), and uniting the Massachusetts Bay Colony and Plymouth Colony. Following Andros&#x27; deposition and arrest, he had William Phips appointed as Royal Governor and they returned to Massachusetts, arriving on May 14, 1692. Following his return, the administration of Harvard grew increasingly insistent that he reside nearer to the institution. Not wanting to leave his Second Church, he did not do so, and eventually resigned the Presidency.

===Salem witch trials===
In 1681, the same year he became president of Harvard and when his son Cotton Mather was only 18-years-old, Increase Mather began work on a manuscript that was to be a collection of &quot;illustrious providences&quot; and he solicited contributions from the other Puritan ministers. This work demonstrated a belated interest in witchcraft relative to the European continent, where witch trials had gone into a steep decline after reaching &quot;peak intensity during the century 1570–1670&quot; but this reflected a similar belated interest among a certain milieu in London around the same time. Increase Mather&#x27;s book &quot;Remarkable Providences&quot; was published in 1684 and forwards a doctrinal belief in the real power of witchcraft. One of the more curious aspects of the book is that while it cites numerous Reformation theologians (Luther, Beza, Melancthon) and many well-known writers on witchcraft including Dominican inquisitor Heinrich Kramer (author of the notorious witch-hunting manual &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;), it does not cite John Calvin.

In November 1692, he published &quot;Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits&quot; which defended the judges and trials, but also expressed words of caution, perhaps due to public pressure. In the postscript, included with the initial first edition of the book, he mentions his own attendance at the trial of George Burroughs and his agreement with the capital judgment against him. George Burroughs had been a fellow minister who seems to have substituted at the pulpit for Increase Mather on at least one occasion. Like his work from 1684, this 1692 work also cites &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;.

His reputation was not improved afterwards or for posterity, due to his association with the trials and his subsequent refusal to denounce them. He was also briefly mentioned in a thorough treatment of his son Cotton by Robert Calef in his comprehensive book of the Salem Trials and their aftermath, &quot;More Wonders of the Invisible World&quot; (referred to as &quot;More Wonders of the Spiritual World&quot; by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition&quot;). Increase Mather was said to have burned Calef&#x27;s book in Harvard Yard.

In 1715, following the death of his wife Maria the previous year, he married Ann Cotton, widow of his nephew John.

Mather owned a slave named Spaniard.

==Illness and death==
On September 27, 1722, he fainted and was thereafter bedridden. In August 1723, he suffered bladder failure and died three weeks later on August 23, 1723, in Boston, aged 84. He was buried in Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground.

Before his death, he took lodging at the retreat of Mineral Spring Pond to recover from his illness and drink from the famous healing waters of the springs from Spring Pond.

==Beliefs==
Throughout his life Mather was a staunch Puritan, opposing anything openly contradictory to, mutually exclusive with, or potentially &quot;distracting&quot; from, his religious beliefs. He supported suppression of intoxication, unnecessary effort on Sundays and ostentatious clothing. He was initially opposed to the Half-Way Covenant but later supported it. He firmly believed in the direct appearance of God&#x27;s disfavor in everyday life, e.g. the weather, political situations, attacks by Native Americans, fires and floods, etc.

He was strenuous in attempting to keep people to his idea of morality, making strong use of jeremiads to try to prevent indifference and especially to try to get government officials to enforce public morality. During his tenure at Harvard he regularly stamped out any relaxation of Puritan strictness, such as latitudinarianism, which had flourished during his overseas absence.

Following his acceptance of the Covenant, Solomon Stoddard and others attempted to further liberalize Puritanism by baptism of children who had nonmember parents and admittance of all but the openly immoral to services. To try to stop this, Mather had a synod called to outlaw similar measures. A declaration was adopted, but never made binding.

==In popular culture==
In John Neal&#x27;s 1828 novel &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot;, Increase Mather appears at the end of Martha Corey&#x27;s witchcraft trial to announce the guilty verdict and give a speech. He is also played by Stephen Lang in the 2014 TV series &quot;Salem&quot;.
Increase Mather also appears in &quot;Act of Oblivion&quot; (2022) by Robert Harris.

<text>The following lists events that happened during [[1976]] in [[Afghanistan]].

President Daud Khan pursues schemes of economic development and agricultural improvements with substantial aid from China, the U.S.S.R., Iran, and Kuwait, partly in the form of long-term loans and partly in technical aid.

==Incumbents==
* President: Mohammed Daoud Khan

==Events==
* Afghanistan and the Soviet Union signed a 5-year trade agreement to improve Soviet-Afghan by 50% in 1980.
* Henry Kissinger visits Afghanistan. He was the last US Secretary of State to visit the country until 2002 which is when Colin Powell visited the country.

==March 1976==
* Afghanistan launches its 7 year development plan

==April 1976==
Floods and earthquakes devastate the provinces of Herat, Helmand, and Kandahar. Pakistan sends a message of sympathy and contributes substantially to relief operations, indicating a marked relaxation of the previously mounting tension between the two countries, largely due to persuasion by Pres. Nikolai Podgorny of the Soviet Union and the Shah of Iran. By mutual consent, both countries refrain from hostile propaganda.

==June 7–11, 1976==
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan visits Kabul. There, both countries undertake to follow principles of respect for territorial integrity and noninterference in internal affairs set forth by the 1955 Bandung Conference of Asian and African nations.

==August 20–24, 1976==
Daud Khan pays a return visit to Islamabad. He and Bhutto reach tentative agreement on a solution to the Pashtunistan problem.

==End of November 1976==
An attempted coup, instigated by discontented retired officers and led by a retired general, Mir Ahmad Shah, is discovered and some 50 persons are arrested.

<doc id="273770" wikidata="Q644162" url="?curid=273770" title="Melchor Cano">
<text>Melchor Cano (1509? – 30 September 1560) was a Spanish Scholastic theologian. Cano&#x27;s most important theological work was his posthumously published &quot;De locis theologicis&quot; (Salamanca, 1563), a major contribution to the New Scholasticism of the Salamanca school.
==Clerical life==
Melchor Cano was born in Tarancón (New Castile); in 1523 he entered the Dominican order in Salamanca, where he was taught by Francisco de Vitoria. He taught at Valladolid (1534–43) and Alcalá (1543–6) before succeeding Vitoria as professor of theology at Salamanca. Cano was a man of deep learning and originality. His only rival was Bartolomé Carranza, also a Dominican and afterwards archbishop of Toledo. At the university the schools were divided between the partisans of the two professors; Cano pursued his rival with relentless virulence, and took part in the condemnation for heresy of his brother-friar. He attended the Council of Trent and participated in the debates on the eucharist and on penance (which dealt with the issue of indulgences). In 1552 Cano was appointed bishop of the Canary Islands at the behest of Jesuits who wanted him out of Spain because of his opposition to their Order; there was unease in Rome about the appointment, and the following year Cano renounced the see.

==Consultatio theologica==
His personal influence with King Philip II of Spain soon brought about his recall, and he was made provincial of his order in Castile. In 1556 he wrote his famous &quot;Consultatio theologica&quot;, in which he advised the king to resist the temporal encroachments of the papacy and, as absolute monarch, to defend his rights by bringing about a radical change in the administration of ecclesiastical revenues, thus making Spain less dependent on Rome. With this in his mind Pope Paul IV styled him &quot;a son of perdition.&quot; In 1557 Cano was elected Dominican provincial of Castile, but the Vatican declined to confirm the appointment; he was again elected in 1559, and after an initial refusal the Vatican acquiesced in the appointment.

==De Locis theologicis==

The reputation of Cano rests on a posthumous work, &quot;De Locis theologicis&quot; (Salamanca, 1562), unrivalled in its own line. In this, a genuine work of the Renaissance, Cano tried to free dogmatic theology from the vain subtleties of the schools; by clearing away the puerilities of the later scholastic theologians, to bring religion back to first principles; and, by giving rules, method, co-ordination and system, to build up a scientific treatment of theology. In discussing the credibility of sources, he was one of the first to inquire into the principles of the credibility of historical documents. He argues that if all serious historians agree about a fact, then we should believe it, even if it is unlikely. Otherwise &quot;It would be as if the Mediterranean peoples were to deny the existence of the ocean ... or if, indeed, we should mock at him who speaks of elephants.&quot;

<text>Sambhaji (Sambhajiraje Shivajiraje Bhonsle, ; 14 May 1657 – 11 March 1689), also known as Shambhuraje, ruled from 1681 to 1689 as the second king (Chhatrapati) of the Maratha Empire, a prominent state in early modern India. He was the eldest son of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire. 

At the age of nine, Sambhaji was taken as a political hostage of the Mughal Empire, to guarantee his father&#x27;s compliance with the treaty of Purandar. He later accompanied his father to Agra where both were placed under house arrest by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb; they subsequently escaped. He was later confined by his father at Panhala Fort, reportedly for his addiction to &quot;sensual pleasures&quot; and violating a Brahmin woman. He subsequently defected to the Mughal Empire and served under Diler Khan in the Battle of Bhupalgarh against his father. He ascended the throne following his father&#x27;s death, with his rule being largely shaped by the ongoing wars between the Marathas and the Mughal Empire, as well as other neighbouring powers such as the Siddi of Janjira, the Wadiyars of Mysore and the Portuguese Empire in Goa. 

Early in his rule, Marathas under Sambhaji attacked and disrupted supply lines and raided into the Mughal territory, although they were unsuccessful in taking over main forts. In 1683, Sambhaji executed 24 members of influential families including top government ministers after discovering a plot to poison him. By 1685, Mughals had gradually pushed back Sambhaji&#x27;s forces by taking over their strongholds. Desertions became common by the end of his reign, and he had alienated Maratha deshmukhs (land owners) by burning villages to deny supplies to the Portuguese. In 1689, he was captured by Mughal forces and executed. His brother Rajaram I succeeded him as king and continued the Mughal–Maratha Wars. 

Sambhaji is viewed poorly by historians, who note that his personal problems—and war crimes committed by his soldiers—overshadowed his moderate military and administrative successes. Maratha soldiers under Sambhaji&#x27;s command during his campaigns committed atrocities against civilians including massacres and mass rape. As a ruler, Sambhaji implemented drought relief measures and encouraged agricultural development while continuing his father&#x27;s administrative systems. He was also a scholar who authored several works in Sanskrit and Hindustani, including the political treatise &quot;&quot;. His torture and death at the hands of the Mughal Empire elevated him to the status of a martyr. He remains popular in modern India among many Hindu nationalists.

== Early life ==
Sambhaji was born at Purandar fort to the Maratha Chhtrapati, Shivaji, and his first wife, Saibai, who died when he was two years old. He was then raised by his paternal grandmother Jijabai. At the age of nine, Sambhaji was sent to live with Raja Jai Singh I of Amber as a political hostage to ensure compliance with the Treaty of Purandar that Shivaji had signed with the Mughals on 11 June 1665. As a result of the treaty, Sambhaji became a Mughal mansabdar. He and his father Shivaji attended the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb&#x27;s court at Agra on 12 May 1666. Aurangzeb put both of them under house arrest but they escaped on 22 July 1666. However, the two sides reconciled and had cordial relations during the period 1666–1670. 

During the period between 1666 and 1668, Aurangzeb initially refused but later officially recognized the title of Raja that Shivaji assumed, on behalf of the Mughal Empire, after being pressed by Prince Mu&#x27;azzam. Aurangzeb looked upon the friendship of Prince Muazzam and Shivaji and Sambhaji with great suspicion. By mediation of Muazzam, Sambhaji was also restored to the Mughal mansabdar rank of 5,000 cavalry. Shivaji then sent Sambhaji with general Prataprao Gujar to take service under Prince Mu&#x27;azzam who was the Mughal viceroy at Aurangabad with Diler Khan as his deputy. Sambhaji visited prince Muazzam at Aurangabad on 4 November 1667 and was then granted rights to territory in Berar on the pretext of revenue collection. After a short stay, Sambhaji returned to Rajgad while representative Maratha officers continued to stay in Aurangabad. In this period, the Marathas under Sambhaji fought alongside the Mughals under Muazzam against the Sultanate of Bijapur.

=== Marriage ===
Sambhaji was married to Jivubai in a marriage of political alliance and as per Maratha custom, she took the name Yesubai. Jivubai was the daughter of Pilaji Shirke, who had entered Shivaji&#x27;s service following the defeat of Deshmukh Suryaji Surve who was his previous liege. This marriage thus gave Shivaji the access of the region of Konkan coastal belt. Yesubai had two children, daughter Bhavani Bai and then a son named Shahu I, who later became the Chhatrapati of the Maratha kingdom. According to &quot;Maasir-i-Alamgiri&quot;, daughters of Sambhaji and his brother Rajaram were married to Mughal noblemen.

=== Arrest and defection to the Mughals ===
Sambhaji&#x27;s behaviour, including alleged irresponsibility and addiction to &quot;sensual pleasures&quot;, led Shivaji to imprison his son at Panhala Fort in 1678 to curb his behaviour. Another theory suggests that Sambhaji was imprisoned at the Panhala because he &quot;attempted to violate a Brahmin&#x27;s wife&quot;. After Shivaji returned from his Southern campaign (Dakshin digvijay), he stationed Sambhaji at Sajjangad, hoping to improve the latter&#x27;s attitude. Sambhaji, although he revered the Matha (Hindu monastics) and their practices, was not adept at following that disciplined routine. A liaison was already established between Sambhaji and Diler Khan, now the sole person in charge of Mughal affairs in south Dakhan. On 13 December 1678, Sambhaji escaped with his wife and rejoined Diler Khan for a year, taking with him a small retinue and leaving Sajjangad with the aim of reaching Pedgaon, the Mughal cantonment. Following this, he was made a Mughal noble with the rank of seven thousand zat and conferred with the title of &quot;Raja&quot; by Aurangzeb. He later attacked the fort of Bhupalgad, which was under Maratha control while serving the Mughals. After returning, he was put under house arrest at Panhala.

According to historian Stewart N. Gordon, Shivaji did not want Sambhaji to succeed him. To this end, he devised a proposal to partition his kingdom between his two sons, with Sambhaji receiving the newly acquired regions of Karnatak and coastal Gingee, while Raja Ram was to be given the heartlands of Maharashtra. Jadunath Sarkar states that Sambhaji, aggrieved by this, is said to have joined Diler Khan in dissent against his father following Khan&#x27;s letters promising Sambhaji to reclaim his right with Mughal support if he joined him. However, Sambhaji later returned to the Maratha fold following Diler Khan&#x27;s unscrupulous behavior. He further states that much of the primary historical sources regarding Sambhaji are disputable, as they were written by people hostile to him.

== Ancestry ==
==Accession==
When Shivaji died in the first week of April 1680, Sambhaji was still held captive at Panhala fort. Some of the influential sardars including ministers Annaji Datto and other ministers conspired against Sambhaji, supported by Soyarabai, to prevent Sambhaji from succeeding the throne. Shivaji&#x27;s widow and Sambhaji&#x27;s stepmother, Soyarabai after her husband&#x27;s death installed the couple&#x27;s ten-year-old son, Rajaram, on the throne on 21 April 1680. Upon hearing this news, Sambhaji plotted his escape and took possession of the Panhala fort on 27 April after killing the fort commander. On 18 June, he acquired control of Raigad fort. Sambhaji formally ascended the throne on 20 July 1680. Rajaram, his wife Janki Bai and mother Soyarabai were imprisoned. Soon after Soyarabai and Annaji Datto hatched another plot against Sambhaji using the exiled Moghul prince Akbar. The prince informed Sambhaji of the plot who then executed Soyarabai, her kinsmen from the Shirke family and Annaji Datto on charges of conspiracy.

== Military expeditions and conflicts ==

Shortly, following his accession, Sambhaji began his military campaigns against neighbouring states. Sambhaji&#x27;s attack on Burhanpur, and granting refuge to prince Akbar, Aurangzeb&#x27;s fugitive son compelled the latter to move south with the Mughal army.

=== Attack on Burhanpur ===

Bahadur Khan was in charge of the fort of Burhanpur who later entrusted Kakar Khan with the same. Kakar was performing the duty of collecting jizya tax from the Hindu citizens of Burhanpur. The Jizya was collected and stored at the Burhanpur fort. Sambhaji plundered and ravaged Burhanpur in 1680. His forces completely routed the Mughal garrison and punitively executed captives. The Marathas then looted the city and set its ports ablaze. Sambhaji then withdrew into Baglana, evading the forces of Mughal commander Khan Jahan Bahadur.

=== Mughal Empire ===
In 1681, Aurangzeb&#x27;s fourth son Muhammad Akbar left the Mughal court along with a few Muslim Mansabdar supporters and joined Muslim rebels in the Deccan. Aurangzeb in response moved his court south to Aurangabad and took over command of the Deccan campaign. The rebels were defeated and Akbar fled south to seek refuge with Sambhaji. Sambhaji&#x27;s ministers including Annaji Datto, and other ministers took this opportunity and conspired again to enthrone Rajaram again. They signed a treasonable letter against Sambhaji in which they promised to join Akbar, to whom the letter was sent. Akbar gave this letter to Sambhaji. Enraged, Sambhaji executed the conspirators on charges of treason.

For five years, Akbar stayed with Sambhaji, hoping that the latter would lend him men and money to strike and seize the Mughal throne for himself. Unfortunately for Sambhaji, giving asylum to Akbar did not bear fruit. Eventually, Sambhaji helped Akbar flee to Persia. On the other hand, Aurangzeb after coming to Deccan never returned to his capital in the north.

==== Siege of Ramsej (1682) ====

In 1682, the Mughals laid siege to the Maratha fort of Ramsej, but after five months of failed attempts, including planting explosive mines and building wooden towers to gain the walls, the Mughal siege failed.

Aurangzeb tried attacking the Maratha Empire from all directions. He intended to use the Mughal numerical superiority to his advantage. Sambhaji had prepared well for the invasions and the Maratha forces promptly engaged the numerically strong Mughal army in several small battles using guerilla warfare tactics. However, Sambhaji and his generals attacked and defeated the Mughal generals whenever they got an opportunity to lure the Mughal generals into decisive battles in the Maratha stronghold territories. Sambhaji had devised a strategy of minimising the losses on his side. If there used to be an opportunity, then the Maratha army attacked decisively, however, if the Mughals were too strong in numbers then the Marathas used to retreat. This proved to be a very effective strategy as Aurangzeb&#x27;s generals were not able to capture the Maratha territories for a period of three years.

==== Mughal invasions of Konkan (1684) ====

Aurangzeb then decided to attack the Maratha capital Raigad Fort directly from the North and the South directions. He made a pincer attempt to surround the Maratha Capital that led to Mughal invasions of Konkan (1684). The Mughals were badly defeated due to the Maratha strategy and the harsh climate of the region. These failures forced Aurangzeb to look away from the Maratha Empire and search for success against the Qutb Shahi dynasty and Adil Shahi dynasty. Under Sambhaji (1680–89) the Marathas ranged up and down western India.

=== Siddis of Janjira ===

The Marathas under Shivaji came into conflict with the Siddis, Muslims of Abyssinian descent settled in India, over the control of the Konkan coast. Shivaji was able to reduce their presence to the Janjira fort, a fortified island of murud. Sambhaji continued the Maratha campaign against them, while at that time the Siddis formed an alliance with the Mughals. At the start of 1682, a Maratha army later joined by Sambhaji personally, attacked the island for thirty days, doing heavy damage but failing to breach its defenses. Sambhaji then attempted a ruse, sending a party of his people to the Siddis, claiming to be defectors. They were allowed into the fort and planned to detonate the gunpowder magazine during a coming Maratha attack. However, one of the female defectors became involved with a Siddi man and he uncovered the plot, and the infiltrators were executed. The Maratha then attempted to build a stone causeway from the shore to the island, but were interrupted halfway through when the Mughal army moved to menace Raigad. Sambhaji returned to counter them and his remaining troops were unable to overcome the Janjira garrison and the Siddi fleet protecting it.

=== Portuguese and English ===

Having failed to take Janjira in 1682, Sambhaji sent a commander to seize the Portuguese coastal fort of Anjadiva instead. The Marathas seized the fort, seeking to turn it into a naval base, but in April 1682 were ejected from the fort by a detachment of 200 Portuguese. This incident led to a larger conflict between the two regional powers.

The Portuguese colony of Goa at that time provided supplies to the Mughals, allowed them to use the Portuguese ports in India and pass through their territory. In order to deny this support to the Mughals, Sambhaji invaded the Portuguese territories of Bardez and Salcette with 20,000 Maratha soldiers. According to an account by Padre Francisco de Souza, Marathas looted, destroyed Churches and raped Christian women. After they had completed sacking, they carried off with themselves many men, women and children whom they later sold to Arabs and Dutch. Jadunath Sarkar notes that the Marathas were notorious for gang-raping women during invasions, including the invasion of Goa under Sambhaji. He elaborates on this by quoting a contemporary account of the event.
 The situation for the colonists became so dire that the Portuguese viceroy, Francisco de Távora, conde de Alvor went with his remaining supporters to the cathedral where the crypt of Saint Francis Xavier was kept, where they prayed for deliverance. The viceroy had the casket opened and gave the saint&#x27;s body his baton, royal credentials and a letter asking the saint&#x27;s support. Sambhaji&#x27;s Goa campaign was checked by the arrival of the Mughal army and navy in January 1684, forcing him to withdraw. The sudden withdrawal of Sambhaji from Goa was cited as the result of a &quot;miraculous intercession&quot; by the saint.

Meanwhile, in 1684 Sambhaji signed a defensive treaty with the English at Bombay, realising his need for English arms and gunpowder, particularly as their lack of artillery and explosives impeded the Maratha&#x27;s ability to lay siege to fortifications. Thus reinforced, Sambhaji proceeded to take Pratapgad and a series of forts along the Ghats.

=== Mysore ===

Much like his father Shivaji&#x27;s Karnataka campaign, Sambhaji attempted in 1681 to invade Mysore, then a southern principality ruled by Wodeyar Chikkadevaraja. Sambhaji&#x27;s large army was repelled, as had happened to Shivaji in 1675. Chikkadevraja later made treaties and rendered tribute to the Maratha kingdom during the conflicts of 1682–1686. Chikkadevraja however began to draw close to the Mughal Emperor and ceased to follow his treaties with the Marathas. In response, Sambhaji invaded Mysore in 1686, accompanied by his Brahmin friend and poet Kavi Kalash.

===Maratha Deshmukhs===
During his short reign, Sambhaji faced Mughal efforts to bring many Maratha Deshmukhs on their side, particularly after the demise of Bijapur and Golconda in 1686–87. Defections had become common by the end of his reign; according to Stewart Gordon, he had &quot;badly alienated&quot; deshmukh families by &quot;burning villages to deny supplies to Goa&quot; during the conflict with the Portuguese. The Deshmukh families that joined the Mughal service during Sambhaji&#x27;s reign were the Mane, Shirke, Jagdale, and Yadav. There were also cases like that of the Jedhe family where one brother joined Mughal service, and the other stayed loyal to Sambhaji.

In 1683, Sambhaji learned from Prince Akbar that the faction opposing him was plotting to offer his kingdom to Akbar in exchange for his support against Sambhaji. Following this, Sambhaji tried and executed 24 members of influential families including top government ministers involved in the plot.

== Capture, torture and execution ==


In the 1687 Battle of Wai, the key Maratha commander Hambirrao Mohite was killed and troops began to desert the Maratha armies. Sambhaji and 25 of his advisors were captured by the Mughal forces of Muqarrab Khan in a skirmish at Sangameshwar in February 1689. Sambhaji&#x27;s positions were spied upon by the Maratha officials close to him, who conveyed this information to Muqarrab Khan. Accounts of Sambhaji&#x27;s confrontation with the Mughal ruler and his following torture and execution and the disposal of his body vary widely depending on the source, though all broadly agree that he was tortured and executed on the emperor&#x27;s orders. The captured Sambhaji and Kavi Kalash were taken to the fort of Bahadurgad at Pedgaon in-present-day Ahmednagar district, where Aurangzeb humiliated them by parading them wearing clown&#x27;s clothes and they were subjected to insults by Mughal soldiers.

Accounts vary as to the reasons for what came next: Mughal accounts state that Sambhaji was asked to surrender his forts, treasures and names of Mughal collaborators with the Marathas and that he sealed his fate by insulting both the emperor and the Islamic prophet Muhammad during interrogation and was executed for having killed Muslims. The ulema of the Mughal Empire sentenced Sambhaji to death on allegations of the atrocities his troops perpetrated against Muslims in Burhanpur, including plunder, killing, dishonour, and torture.

Aurangzeb ordered the torture and execution of Sambhaji and Kavi Kalash. According to Khafi Khan and Ishwar Das Nagar, Sambhaji and Kavi Kalash were blinded with red-hot irons first. Both were executed by beheading on 11 March 1689 at Tulapur on the banks of the Bhima river near Pune. Some accounts state that Sambhaji&#x27;s body was cut into pieces and thrown into the river or that the body or portions were recaptured and cremated at the confluence of the rivers at Tulapur. Other accounts state that Sambhaji&#x27;s remains were fed to the dogs.

== Succession ==
The Maratha Kingdom was put into disarray by Sambhaji&#x27;s death and his younger half-brother Rajaram I assumed the throne. Rajaram shifted the Maratha capital far south to Jinji, while Maratha guerrilla fighters under Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav continued to harass the Mughal army. A few days after Sambhaji&#x27;s death, the capital Raigad Fort fell to the Mughals. Sambhaji&#x27;s widow, Yesubai, son, Shahu and Shivaji&#x27;s widow, Sakvarbai were captured; Sakvarbai died in Mughal captivity. Shahu, who was seven years of age when captured, remained prisoner of the Mughals for 18 years from February 1689 until Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb&#x27;s death in 1707. Shahu was then set free by Emperor Muhammad Azam Shah, son of Aurangzeb. After his release, Shahu had to fight a brief succession war with his aunt Tarabai, Rajaram&#x27;s widow who claimed the throne for her own son, Shivaji II. The Mughals kept Yesubai captive to ensure that Shahu adhered to the terms of his release. She was released in 1719 when the Marathas became strong under Shahu and Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath.

== Governance ==

Sambhaji inherited the governance system created by Shivaji. He continued with most of his father&#x27;s policies. The administration of the state was managed by Sambhaji with the help of Chandogamatya and the council of eight ministers. According to P. S. Joshi, Sambhaji was a good administrator who gave impartial justice to his subjects.

=== Measures against drought ===
Maharashtra witnessed severe drought during the reign of Sambhaji (1684–88). Sambhaji had to take several administrative measures to tackle the situation. Sambhaji continued Shivaji&#x27;s policies by helping poor farmers. Shankar Narayan Joshi has stated that his approach against famine was very constructive and he provided solutions to many complicated problems. His policies of water storage, irrigation and developing crop patterns exhibited his progressive policies.

Sambhaji provided grain seeds, exemptions in taxes, oxen for agricultural work and agricultural tools to the farmers in the drought situation. All these measures were implemented sincerely during the drought period.

=== Agriculture ===
Sambhaji encouraged agricultural activity in the Maratha state. Agriculture was the backbone of the rural Maratha economy. He encouraged people to cultivate more land. The government of Sambhaji gave promises of safety to the Marathas who gained independence from the Mughals and asked them to carry out their previous work of cultivation in their territories. It also called back people who had absconded because of their inability to pay taxes and asked them to carry on their previous work of cultivation. Sambhaji tried to increase the revenue from agricultural activities. He also made efforts to cultivate more wasted or barren lands.

Sambhaji, in his letter of 3 June 1684, directed his prime minister Nilkantha Moreshwar to bring the agricultural land of the villages confiscated by the government under cultivation which otherwise would have remained uncultivated. He also asked Hari Shivdev to distribute fifty khandis of grain which were being sent to him from Sagargad among the cultivators.

=== Religious policy ===
Sambhaji, his ministers and officers took keen interest in supporting the cultural and religious activity in the state. They honoured and encouraged learning by granting land, grains and money to scholars.

== Education and writings ==
Sambhaji was sophisticated, educated and well-versed in Sanskrit and Hindustani in addition to Marathi. Keshav Pandit, alias Keshav Bhatta of Shringarpur, was employed for his education; an erudite scholar, he composed &quot;Dandaniti&quot; on Maratha jurisprudence and later wrote a Sanskrit biography of Sanskrit biography of Sambhaji&#x27;s brother and successor Rajaram, &quot;Rajaram Charitam&quot;. In addition to law, he appears to have made Sambhaji familiar with much scholarship in Sanskrit.

Sambhaji composed several books during his lifetime, notably &quot;&quot; in Sanskrit and &quot;Nayikabhed&quot;, &quot;Saatsatak&quot; and &quot;Nakhshikha&quot; in Hindustani. In &quot;Budhbhushanam&quot;, Sambhaji wrote poetry on politics, including dos and don&#x27;ts for a king and military tactics. The first few &quot;shlokas&quot; are praises for his grandfather Shahaji, whom he considers to be an incarnation of Indra, and his father Shivaji, whom he considers to be an incarnation of Vishnu.

== Legacy ==
During his reign, Sambhaji was unable to accomplish much for his people. However, his death elevated him to the status of a martyr. Sambhaji has been considered a dharmaveer (lit. protector of dharma) for his role in shepherding the young Maratha empire, although not all commentators agree on the designation, which implies a religious aspect to his life and governance. Many statues of Sambhaji exist in India. Sambhaji is viewed positively by the modern Indian Hindu movement, as he is seen as emblematic of Hindavi Swarajya (Hindu self-rule). However, Hindu nationalist icons such as V. D. Savarkar and M. S. Golwalkar had a negative view of Sambhaji. Savarkar found Sambhaji to be &quot;unfit to rule over the Maratha empire&quot;.

&quot;The Hindu&quot; assesses that &quot;Sambhaji’s fealty to the Hindu dharma in the face of certain death has earned him much admiration from Hindu nationalists. Some early Marathi writers, however, portrayed him as irresponsible and wayward. Yet others have held him up as a figure of unwavering valiance who inspired the Marathas in their fight against the Mughals.&quot;

==Biographies==
Kavindra Paramanand Govind Newaskar of Poladpur composed &quot;Anupurana&quot;, a partially-completed Sanskrit biography on the life of Chhatrapati Sambhaji up to the birth of Shahu I, as a sequel to his father&#x27;s Sanskrit biography &quot;Shivabharata&quot;. Hari Kavi, also known as Bhanubhatta, composed &quot;Haihayendra Charitra&quot; as well as its commentary, &quot;Shambu Vilasika&quot; on the orders of Sambhaji. Hari Kavi also authored &quot;Subhashitaharavalli&quot; and composed the Sanskrit biography &quot;Shambhuraja Charitra&quot; on Sambhaji&#x27;s life and romance in 1684.

<text>A thought disorder (TD) is a disturbance in cognition which affects language, thought and communication. Psychiatric and psychological glossaries in 2015 and 2017 identified thought disorders as encompassing poverty of ideas, paralogia (a reasoning disorder characterized by expression of illogical or delusional thoughts), word salad, and delusions—all disturbances of thought content and form. Two specific terms have been suggested—content thought disorder (CTD) and formal thought disorder (FTD). CTD has been defined as a thought disturbance characterized by multiple fragmented delusions, and the term &quot;thought disorder&quot; is often used to refer to an FTD: a disruption of the form (or structure) of thought. Also known as disorganized thinking, FTD results in disorganized speech and is recognized as a major feature of schizophrenia and other psychoses (including mood disorders, dementia, mania, and neurological diseases). Disorganized speech leads to an inference of disorganized thought. Thought disorders include derailment, pressured speech, poverty of speech, tangentiality, verbigeration, and thought blocking. One of the first known public presentations of thought disorders, or specifically OCD as it is known today, was in 1691. Bishop John Moore gave a speech before Queen Mary II, about &quot;religious melancholy.&quot;

Formal thought disorder affects the form (rather than the content) of thought. Unlike hallucinations and delusions, it is an observable, objective sign of psychosis. FTD is a common core symptom of a psychotic disorder, and may be seen as a marker of severity and as an indicator of prognosis. It reflects a cluster of cognitive, linguistic, and affective disturbances that have generated research interest in the fields of cognitive neuroscience, neurolinguistics, and psychiatry.

Eugen Bleuler, who named schizophrenia, said that TD was its defining characteristic. Disturbances of thinking and speech, such as clanging or echolalia, may also be present in Tourette syndrome; other symptoms may be found in delirium. A clinical difference exists between these two groups. Patients with psychoses are less likely to show awareness or concern about disordered thinking, and those with other disorders are aware and concerned about not being able to think clearly.

== Content thought disorder ==

Thought content is the subject of an individual&#x27;s thoughts, or the types of ideas expressed by the individual. Mental health professionals define normal thought content as the absence of significant abnormalities, distortions, or harmful thoughts. Normal thought content aligns with reality, is appropriate to the situation, and does not cause significant distress or impair functioning.

A person&#x27;s cultural background must be considered when assessing thought content. Abnormalities in thought content differ across cultures. Specific types of abnormal thought content can be features of different psychiatric illnesses.

Examples of disordered thought content include:

* Suicidal thinking: thoughts of ending one&#x27;s own life.
* Homicidal thinking: thoughts of ending the life of another.
* Delusion: A fixed, false belief that a person holds despite contrary evidence and that is not a shared cultural belief.
* Paranoid ideation: thoughts, not severe enough to be considered delusions, involving excessive suspicion or the belief that one is being harassed, persecuted, or unfairly treated.

* Preoccupation: excessive and/or distressing thoughts that are stressor-related and associated with negative emotions. 
* Obsession: a repetitive thought that is intrusive or inappropriate and distressing or upsetting.
* Compulsion: A repeated behavior or mental act done in response to an obsession. It aims to reduce anxiety or distress. But, it is not feasibly related to the anxiety-provoking stimulus. It is excessive and distressing.
* Magical thinking: A false belief in a causal link between actions and events. The mistaken belief that one&#x27;s thoughts, words, or actions can cause or prevent an outcome in a way that violates the laws of cause and effect. 
* Overvalued ideas: false or exaggerated belief held with conviction, but without delusional intensity.
* Phobias: irrational fears of objects or circumstances that are persistent.

* Poverty of thought: abnormally few thoughts and ideas expressed.
* Overabundance of thought: abnormally many thoughts and ideas expressed.

==Formal thought disorder==

Thought process is a person&#x27;s form, flow, and coherence of thinking. This is how they use language and put ideas together. A normal thought process is logical, linear, meaningful, and goal-directed. A logical, linear thought process is one that demonstrates rational connections between thoughts in a way that is sequential that allows others to understand. Thought process is not what a person thinks, rather it is how a person expresses their thoughts.

Formal thought disorder (FTD), also known as disorganized speech or disorganized thinking, is a disorder of a person&#x27;s thought process in which they are unable to express their thoughts in a logical and linear fashion. To be considered FTD, disorganized thinking must be severe enough that it impairs effective communication. Disorganized speech is a core symptom of psychosis, and therefore can be a feature of any condition that has a potential to cause psychosis, including schizophrenia, mania, major depressive disorder, delirium, postpartum psychosis, major neurocognitive disorder, and substance induced psychosis. FTD reflects a cluster of cognitive, linguistic, and affective disturbances, and has generated research interest from the fields of cognitive neuroscience, neurolinguistics, and psychiatry.

It can be subdivided into clusters of positive and negative symptoms and objective (rather than subjective) symptoms. On the scale of positive and negative symptoms, they have been grouped into positive formal thought disorder (posFTD) and negative formal thought disorder (negFTD). Positive subtypes were pressure of speech, tangentiality, derailment, incoherence, and illogicality; negative subtypes were poverty of speech and poverty of content. The two groups were posited to be at either end of a spectrum of normal speech, but later studies showed them to be poorly correlated. A comprehensive measure of FTD is the Thought and Language Disorder (TALD) Scale. The Kiddie Formal Thought Disorder Rating Scale (K-FTDS) can be used to assess the presence of formal thought disorder in children and their childhood. Although it is very extensive and time-consuming, its results are in great detail and reliable.

Nancy Andreasen preferred to identify TDs as &quot;thought-language-communication disorders&quot; (TLC disorders). Up to seven domains of FTD have been described on the Thought, Language, Communication (TLC) Scale, with most of the variance accounted for by two or three domains. Some TLC disorders are more suggestive of severe disorder, and are listed with the first 11 items.

=== Diagnoses ===
The DSM-V categorizes FTD as &quot;a psychotic symptom, manifested as bizarre speech and communication.&quot; FTD may include incoherence, peculiar words, disconnected ideas, or a lack of unprompted content expected from normal speech. Clinical psychologists typically assess FTD by initiating an exploratory conversation with patients and observing the patient&#x27;s verbal responses.

FTD is often used to establish a diagnosis of schizophrenia; in cross-sectional studies, 27 to 80 percent of patients with schizophrenia present with FTD. A hallmark feature of schizophrenia, it is also widespread amongst other psychiatric disorders; up to 60 percent of those with schizoaffective disorder and 53 percent of those with clinical depression demonstrate FTD, suggesting that it is not exclusive to schizophrenia. About six percent of healthy subjects exhibit a mild form of FTD. The DSM-V-TR mentions that less severe FTD may happen during the initial (prodromal) and residual periods of schizophrenia.

The characteristics of FTD vary amongst disorders. A number of studies indicate that FTD in mania is marked by irrelevant intrusions and pronounced combinatory thinking, usually with a playfulness and flippancy absent from patients with schizophrenia. The FTD present in patients with schizophrenia was characterized by disorganization, neologism, and fluid thinking, and confusion with word-finding difficulty.

There is limited data on the longitudinal course of FTD. The most comprehensive longitudinal study of FTD by 2023 found a distinction in the longitudinal course of thought-disorder symptoms between schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The study also found an association between pre-index assessments of social, work and educational functioning and the longitudinal course of FTD.

=== Possible causes ===

Several theories have been developed to explain the causes of formal thought disorder. It has been proposed that FTD relates to neurocognition via semantic memory. Semantic network impairment in people with schizophreniameasured by the difference between fluency (e.g. the number of animals&#x27; names produced in 60 seconds) and phonological fluency (e.g. the number of words beginning with &quot;F&quot; produced in 60 seconds)predicts the severity of formal thought disorder, suggesting that verbal information (through semantic priming) is unavailable. Other hypotheses include working memory deficit (being confused about what has already been said in a conversation) and attentional focus.

FTD in schizophrenia has been found to be associated with structural and functional abnormalities in the language network, where structural studies have found bilateral grey matter deficits; deficits in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral inferior parietal lobule and bilateral superior temporal gyrus are FTD correlates. Other studies did not find an association between FTD and structural aberrations of the language network, however, and regions not included in the language network have been associated with FTD. Future research is needed to clarify whether there is an association with FTD in schizophrenia and neural abnormalities in the language network.

Transmitter systems which might cause FTD have also been investigated. Studies have found that glutamate dysfunction, due to a rarefaction of glutamatergic synapses in the superior temporal gyrus in patients with schizophrenia, is a major cause of positive FTD.

The heritability of FTD has been demonstrated in a number of family and twin studies. Imaging genetics studies, using a semantic verbal-fluency task performed by the participants during functional MRI scanning, revealed that alleles linked to glutamatergic transmission contribute to functional aberrations in typical language-related brain areas. FTD is not solely genetically determined, however; environmental influences, such as allusive thinking in parents during childhood, and environmental risk factors for schizophrenia (including childhood abuse, migration, social isolation, and cannabis use) also contribute to the pathophysiology of FTD.

The origins of FTD have been theorised from a social-learning perspective. Singer and Wynne said that familial communication patterns play a key role in shaping the development of FTD; dysfunctional social interactions undermine a child&#x27;s development of cohesive, stable mental representations of the world, increasing their risk of developing FTD.

=== Treatments ===
Antipsychotic medication is often used to treat FTD. Although the vast majority of studies of the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment do not report effects on syndromes or symptoms, six older studies report the effects of antipsychotic treatment on FTD. These studies and clinical experience indicate that antipsychotics are often an effective treatment for patients with positive or negative FTD, but not all patients respond to them.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is another treatment for FTD, but its effectiveness has not been well-studied. Large randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of CBT for treating psychosis often exclude individuals with severe FTD because it reduces the therapeutic alliance required by the therapy. However, provisional evidence suggests that FTD may not preclude the effectiveness of CBT.
Kircher and colleagues have suggested that the following methods should be used in CBT for patients with FTD:
*Practice structuring, summarizing, and feedback methods
*Repeat and clarify the core issues and main emotions that the patient is trying to communicate
*Gently encourage patients to clarify what they are trying to communicate
*Ask patients to clearly state their communication goal
*Ask patients to slow down and explain how one point leads to another
*Help patients identify the links between ideas
*Identify the main affect linked to the thought disorder
*Normalize problems with thinking

== Signs and symptoms ==
Language abnormalities exist in the general population, and do not necessarily indicate a condition. They can occur in schizophrenia and other disorders (such as mania or depression), or in anyone who may be tired or stressed. To distinguish thought disorder, patterns of speech, severity of symptoms, their frequency, and any resulting functional impairment can be considered.

Symptoms of FTD include derailment, pressured speech, poverty of speech, tangentiality, and thought blocking. The most common forms of FTD observed are tangentiality and circumstantiality. FTD is a hallmark feature of schizophrenia, but is also associated with other conditions that can cause psychosis (including mood disorders, dementia, mania, and neurological diseases). Impaired attention, poor memory, and difficulty formulating abstract concepts may also reflect TD, and can be observed and assessed with mental-status tests such as serial sevens or memory tests.

=== Types ===
Thirty symptoms (or features) of TD have been described, including:
*Alogia: A poverty of speech in amount or content, it is classified as a negative symptom of schizophrenia. When further classifying symptoms, poverty of speech content (little meaningful content with a normal amount of speech) is a disorganization symptom. Under SANS, thought blocking is considered a part of alogia, and so is increased latency in response.
*Circumstantial speech (also known as &quot;circumstantial thinking&quot;): An inability to answer a question without excessive, unnecessary or irrelevant detail. The point of the conversation is eventually reached, unlike in tangential speech. A patient may answer the question &quot;How have you been sleeping lately?&quot; with &quot;Oh, I go to bed early, so I can get plenty of rest. I like to listen to music or read before bed. Right now I&#x27;m reading a good mystery. Maybe I&#x27;ll write a mystery someday. But it isn&#x27;t helping, reading I mean. I have been getting only 2 or 3 hours of sleep at night.&quot;
*Clanging: An instance where ideas are related only by phonetics (similar or rhyming sounds) rather than actual meaning. This may be heard as excessive rhyming or alliteration (&quot;Many moldy mushrooms merge out of the mildewy mud on Mondays&quot;, or &quot;I heard the bell. Well, hell, then I fell&quot;). It is most commonly seen in the manic phase of bipolar disorder, although it is also often observed in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.
*Derailment (also known as &quot;loosening of associations&quot; and &quot;knight&#x27;s move thinking&quot;): Thought frequently moves from one idea to another which is obliquely related or unrelated, often appearing in speech but also in writing (&quot;The next day when I&#x27;d be going out you know, I took control, like uh, I put bleach on my hair in California&quot;),
*Distractible speech: In mid-speech, the subject is changed in response to a nearby stimulus (&quot;Then I left San Francisco and moved to ... Where did you get that tie?&quot;)
*Echolalia: Echoing of another&#x27;s speech, once or in repetition. It may involve repeating only the last few words (or the last word) of another person&#x27;s sentences, and is common on the autism spectrum and in Tourette syndrome. 
*Evasion: The next logical idea in a sequence is replaced with another idea closely (but not accurately or appropriately) related to it; also known as &quot;paralogia&quot; and &quot;perverted logic&quot;.
*Flight of ideas: A form of FTD marked by abrupt leaps from one topic to another, possibly with discernible links between successive ideas, perhaps governed by similarities between subjects or by rhyming, puns, wordplay, or innocuous environmental stimuli (such as the sound of birds chirping). It is most characteristic of the manic phase of bipolar disorder.
*Illogicality: Conclusions are reached which do not follow logically (non sequiturs or faulty inferences). &quot;Do you think this will fit in the box?&quot; is answered with, &quot;Well of course; it&#x27;s brown, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;
*Incoherence (word salad): Speech which is unintelligible because the individual words are real, but the manner in which they are strung together results in gibberish. The question &quot;Why do people comb their hair?&quot; elicits a response like &quot;Because it makes a twirl in life, my box is broken help me blue elephant. Isn&#x27;t lettuce brave? I like electrons, hello please!&quot;
*Neologisms: Completely new words (or phrases) whose origins and meanings are usually unrecognizable (&quot;I got so angry I picked up a dish and threw it at the geshinker&quot;). They may also involve elisions of two words which are similar in meaning or sound. Although neologisms may refer to words formed incorrectly whose origins are understandable (such as &quot;headshoe&quot; for &quot;hat&quot;), these can be more clearly referred to as word approximations.
*Overinclusion: The failure to eliminate ineffective, inappropriate, irrelevant, extraneous details associated with a particular stimulus.
*Perseveration: Persistent repetition of words or ideas, even when another person tries to change the subject. (&quot;It&#x27;s great to be here in Nevada, Nevada, Nevada, Nevada, Nevada.&quot;) It may also involve repeatedly giving the same answer to different questions (&quot;Is your name Mary?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Are you in the hospital?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Are you a table?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;). Perseveration can include palilalia and logoclonia, and may indicate an organic brain disease such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease.
*Phonemic paraphasia: Mispronunciation; syllables out of sequence (&quot;I slipped on the lice and broke my arm&quot;).
*Pressured speech: Rapid speech without pauses, which is difficult to interrupt.
*Referential thinking: Viewing innocuous stimuli as having a specific meaning for the self (&quot;What&#x27;s the time?&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s 7 o&#x27;clock. That&#x27;s my problem&quot;).
*Semantic paraphasia: Substitution of inappropriate words (&quot;I slipped on the coat, on the ice I mean, and broke my book&quot;).
*Stilted speech: Speech characterized by words or phrases which are flowery, excessive, and pompous (&quot;The attorney comported himself indecorously&quot;).
*Tangential speech: Wandering from the topic and never returning to it, or providing requested information (&quot;Where are you from?&quot; &quot;My dog is from England. They have good fish and chips there. Fish breathe through gills&quot;).
*Thought blocking (also known as &quot;deprivation of thought&quot; and &quot;obstructive thought&quot;): An abrupt stop in the middle of a train of thought which may not be able to be continued.
*Verbigeration: Meaningless, stereotyped repetition of words or phrases which replace understandable speech; seen in schizophrenia.

==Terminology==
Psychiatric and psychological glossaries in 2015 and 2017 defined &quot;thought disorder&quot;&#x27; as disturbed thinking or cognition which affects communication, language, or thought content including poverty of ideas, neologisms, paralogia, word salad, and delusions (disturbances of thought content and form), and suggested the more-specific terms content thought disorder (CTD) and formal thought disorder (FTD). CTD was defined as a TD characterized by multiple fragmented delusions, and FTD was defined as a disturbance in the form or structure of thinking.
The 2013 DSM-5 only used the term FTD, primarily as a synonym for disorganized thinking and speech. This contrasts with the 1992 ICD-10 (which only used the word &quot;thought disorder&quot;, always accompanied with &quot;delusion&quot; and &quot;hallucination&quot;) and a 2002 medical dictionary which generally defined thought disorders similarly to the psychiatric glossaries and used the word in other entries as the ICD-10 did.

A 2017 psychiatric text describing thought disorder as a &quot;disorganization syndrome&quot; in the context of schizophrenia:

The text said that some clinicians use the term &quot;formal thought disorder&quot; broadly, referring to abnormalities in thought form with psychotic cognitive signs or symptoms, and studies of cognition and subsyndromes in schizophrenia may refer to FTD as &quot;conceptual disorganization&quot; or &quot;disorganization factor&quot;.

Some disagree:
==Course, diagnosis, and prognosis==
It was believed that TD occurred only in schizophrenia, but later findings indicate that it may occur in other psychiatric conditions (including mania) and in people without mental illness. Not all people with schizophrenia have a TD; the condition is not specific to the disease.

When defining thought-disorder subtypes and classifying them as positive or negative symptoms, Nancy Andreasen found 
that different subtypes of TD occur at different frequencies in those with mania, depression, and schizophrenia. People with mania have pressured speech as the most prominent symptom, and have rates of derailment, tangentiality, and incoherence as prominent as in those with schizophrenia. They are likelier to have pressured speech, distractibility, and circumstantiality.

People with schizophrenia have more negative TD, including poverty of speech and poverty of content of speech, but also have relatively high rates of some positive TD. Derailment, loss of goal, poverty of content of speech, tangentiality and illogicality are particularly characteristic of schizophrenia. People with depression have relatively-fewer TDs; the most prominent are poverty of speech, poverty of content of speech, and circumstantiality. Andreasen noted the diagnostic usefulness of dividing the symptoms into subtypes; negative TDs without full affective symptoms suggest schizophrenia.

She also cited the prognostic value of negative-positive-symptom divisions. In manic patients, most TDs resolve six months after evaluation; this suggests that TDs in mania, although as severe as in schizophrenia, tend to improve. In people with schizophrenia, however, negative TDs remain after six months and sometimes worsen; positive TDs somewhat improve. A negative TD is a good predictor of some outcomes; patients with prominent negative TDs are worse in social functioning six months later. More prominent negative symptoms generally suggest a worse outcome; however, some people may do well, respond to medication, and have normal brain function. Positive symptoms vary similarly.

A prominent TD at illness onset suggests a worse prognosis, including: 
* illness begins earlier
* increased risk of hospitalization
* decreased functional outcomes
* increased disability rates 
* increased inappropriate social behaviors
TD which is unresponsive to treatment predicts a worse illness course. In schizophrenia, TD severity tends to be more stable than hallucinations and delusions. Prominent TDs are more unlikely to diminish in middle age, compared with positive symptoms. Less-severe TD may occur during the prodromal and residual periods of schizophrenia. Treatment for thought disorder may include psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), and psychotropic medications.

The DSM-5 includes delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought process (formal thought disorder), and disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (including catatonia) as key symptoms of psychosis. Schizophrenia-spectrum disorders such as schizoaffective disorder and schizophreniform disorder typically consist of prominent hallucinations, delusions and FTD; the latter presents as severely disorganized, bizarre, and catatonic behavior. Psychotic disorders due to medical conditions and substance use typically consist of delusions and hallucinations. The rarer delusional disorder and shared psychotic disorder typically present with persistent delusions. FTDs are commonly found in schizophrenia and mood disorders, with poverty of speech content more common in schizophrenia.

Psychoses such as schizophrenia and bipolar mania are distinguishable from malingering, when an individual fakes illness for other gains, by clinical presentations; malingerers feign thought content with no irregularities in form such as derailment or looseness of association. Negative symptoms, including alogia, may be absent, and chronic thought disorder is typically distressing.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) whose diagnosis requires the onset of symptoms before three years of age can be distinguished from early-onset schizophrenia; schizophrenia under age 10 is extremely rare, and ASD patients do not display FTDs. However, it has been suggested that individuals with ASD display language disturbances like those found in schizophrenia; a 2008 study found that children and adolescents with ASD showed significantly more illogical thinking and loose associations than control subjects. The illogical thinking was related to cognitive functioning and executive control; the loose associations were related to communication symptoms and parent reports of stress and anxiety.

Rorschach tests have been useful for assessing TD in disturbed patients. A series of inkblots are shown, and patient responses are analyzed to determine disturbances of thought. The nature of the assessment offers insight into the cognitive processes of another, and how they respond to equivocal stimuli. Hermann Rorschach developed this test to diagnose schizophrenia after realizing that people with schizophrenia gave drastically different interpretations of Klecksographie inkblots from others whose thought processes were considered normal, and it has become one of the most widely used assessment tools for diagnosing TDs.

The Thought Disorder Index (TDI), also known as the Delta Index, was developed to help further determine the severity of TD in verbal responses. TDI scores are primarily derived from verbally-expressed interpretations of the Rorschach test, but TDI can also be used with other verbal samples (including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale). TDI has a twenty-three-category scoring index; each category scores the level of severity on a scale from 0 to 1, with .25 being mild and 1.00 being most severe (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00).

==Criticism==
TD has been criticized as being based on circular or incoherent definitions. Symptoms of TD are inferred from disordered speech, based on the assumption that disordered speech arises from disordered thought. Although TD is typically associated with psychosis, similar phenomena can appear in different disorders and leading to misdiagnosis.

A criticism related to the separation of symptoms of schizophrenia into negative or positive symptoms, including TD, is that it oversimplifies the complexity of TD and its relationship to other positive symptoms. Factor analysis has found that negative symptoms tend to correlate with one another, but positive symptoms tend to separate into two groups. The three clusters became known as negative symptoms, psychotic symptoms, and disorganization symptoms. Alogia, a TD traditionally classified as a negative symptom, can be separated into two types: poverty of speech content (a disorganization symptom) and poverty of speech, response latency, and thought blocking (negative symptoms).
Positive-negative-symptom diametrics, however, may enable a more accurate characterization of schizophrenia.

<text>John Nicholas Cassavetes (December 9, 1929 – February 3, 1989) was an American filmmaker and actor. He began as an actor in film and television before helping to pioneer modern American independent cinema as a writer and director, often self-financing, producing, and distributing his own films. He received nominations for three Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and an Emmy Award.

After studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, Cassavetes started his career in television acting in numerous network dramas. From 1959 to 1960 he played the title role in the NBC detective series &quot;Johnny Staccato&quot;. He acted in notable films, such as Martin Ritt&#x27;s film noir &quot;Edge of the City&quot; (1957), Robert Aldrich&#x27;s war film &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), Roman Polanski&#x27;s horror film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968) and Elaine May&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot; (1976). For &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, he earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

As a director, Cassavetes became known for a string of critically acclaimed independent dramas including &quot;Shadows&quot; (1959), &quot;Faces&quot; (1968), &quot;Husbands&quot; (1970), &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; (1974), &quot;Opening Night&quot; (1977), and &quot;Love Streams&quot; (1984). His films employed an actor-centered approach which prioritized raw character relationships and &quot;small feelings&quot; while rejecting traditional Hollywood storytelling, method acting, and stylization. His films became associated with an improvisational aesthetic and a cinéma vérité feel. He received Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay (&quot;Faces&quot;) and Best Director (&quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot;).

He frequently collaborated with American actress Gena Rowlands (to whom he was married from 1954 until his death in 1989) and friends Peter Falk, Ben Gazzara, and Seymour Cassel. Many of his films were shot and edited in his and Rowlands&#x27; own Los Angeles home. 

He and Rowlands had a son named Nick and two daughters, named Alexandra and Zoe, all of whom followed them into acting and filmmaking.

== Early life and education ==
John Nicholas Cassavetes was born in New York City on December 9, 1929, the son of Greek-American actress Katherine Cassavetes (née Demetriou), who was later featured in some of his films, and Greek immigrant Nicholas John Cassavetes. His early years were spent with his family in Greece; when he returned to New York at the age of seven, he spoke no English. He was then raised on Long Island, where he attended Paul D. Schreiber Senior High School (then known as Port Washington High School) from 1945 to 1947 and participated in &quot;Port Weekly&quot; (the school paper), &quot;Red Domino&quot; (interclass play), football, and the &quot;Port Light&quot; (yearbook).

Cassavetes attended Blair Academy in New Jersey and spent a semester at Champlain College in Burlington, Vermont, but was expelled due to his failing grades. He spent a few weeks hitchhiking to Florida and then transferred to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, encouraged by recently enrolled friends who told him the school was &quot;packed with girls&quot;. He graduated in 1950 and met his future wife Gena Rowlands at her audition to enter the Academy in 1953. They were married four months later in 1954. He continued acting in the theater, took small parts in films, and began working on television in anthology series such as &quot;Alcoa Theatre&quot;.

==Career==

===Acting workshop===
By 1956, Cassavetes had begun teaching an alternative to method acting in his own workshop—co-founded with friend Burt Lane in New York City—in which performance would be based on character creation rather than back-story or narrative requirements. Cassavetes particularly scorned Lee Strasberg&#x27;s Method-based Actors Studio, and the Cassavetes-Lane approach held that acting should be an expression of creative joy rather than the &quot;moody, broody anguish&quot; associated with Strasberg&#x27;s teaching.

Shortly after opening the workshop, Cassavetes was invited to audition at the Actors Studio, and he and Lane devised a prank: they claimed to be performing a scene from a recent stage production but in fact improvised a performance on the spot, fooling an impressed Strasberg. Cassavetes then fabricated a story about his financial troubles, prompting Strasberg to offer him a full scholarship to the Studio; Cassavetes immediately rejected it, feeling that Strasberg did not know anything about acting if he had been so easily fooled by the two ruses.

An improvisation exercise in the workshop inspired the idea for his writing and directorial debut, &quot;Shadows&quot; (1959; first version 1957). Cassavetes raised the funds for the production from friends and family, as well as listeners to Jean Shepherd&#x27;s late-night radio talk-show &quot;Night People&quot;. His stated purpose was to make a film about modest-income “little people”, unlike Hollywood studio productions, which focused on stories about wealthy people. Cassavetes was unable to gain American distribution of &quot;Shadows&quot;, but it won the Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival. European distributors later released the movie in the United States as an import. Although the box-office returns of &quot;Shadows&quot; in the United States were slight, it did gain attention from the Hollywood studios.

=== Television and acting jobs ===

Cassavetes played bit-parts in B pictures and in television serials, until gaining notoriety in 1955 as a vicious killer in &quot;The Night Holds Terror,&quot; and as a juvenile delinquent in the live TV drama &quot;Crime in the Streets&quot;. Cassavetes would repeat this performance credited as an “introducing” lead in the 1956 film version, which also included another future director, Mark Rydell, as his gang mate. His first starring role in a feature film was &quot;Edge of the City&quot; (1957), which co-starred Sidney Poitier. He was briefly under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and co-starred with Robert Taylor in the western &quot;Saddle the Wind&quot;, written by Rod Serling. In the late 1950s, Cassavetes guest-starred in Beverly Garland&#x27;s groundbreaking crime drama, &quot;Decoy&quot;, about a New York City woman police undercover detective. Thereafter, he played Johnny Staccato, the title character in a television series about a jazz pianist who also worked as a private detective. In total he directed five episodes of the series, which also features a guest appearance by his wife Gena Rowlands. It was broadcast on NBC between September 1959 and March 1960, and then acquired by ABC; although critically acclaimed, the series was cancelled in September 1960. Cassavetes would appear on the NBC interview program, &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;.

=== 1960s ===
In 1961 Cassavetes signed a seven-year deal with Paramount. Cassavetes directed two movies for Hollywood in the early 1960s: &quot;Too Late Blues&quot; (1961); &quot;A Child Is Waiting (1963)&quot; starring Burt Lancaster and Judy Garland. He starred in the CBS western series &quot;Rawhide&quot; in the episode &quot;Incident Near Gloomy River&quot; (1961). In the 1963–1964 season he was cast in the ABC medical drama about psychiatry, &quot;Breaking Point&quot;. In 1964, he again co-starred with his wife, this time in an episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; anthology program, and in 1965, he appeared on ABC&#x27;s western series, &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot;. In the same year, he also guest-starred in the World War II series &quot;Combat!&quot;, in the episode &quot;S.I.W.&quot;, and as the insane nuclear scientist Everett Lang in &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;, season 2, episode &quot;The Peacemaker&quot;.

With payment for his work on television, as well as a handful of film acting jobs, he was able to relocate to California and to make his subsequent films independent of any studio, as &quot;Shadows&quot; had been made. The films in which he acted with this intention include Don Siegel&#x27;s &quot;The Killers&quot; (1964), the motorcycle gang movie &quot;Devil&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1967), &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the Guy Woodhouse lead (originally intended for Robert Redford) in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), and &quot;The Fury&quot; (1978). Cassavetes portrayed the murderer in a 1972 episode of the TV crime series &quot;Columbo&quot;, titled &quot;Étude in Black&quot;. Cassavetes and series star Peter Falk had previously starred together in the 1969 mob action thriller &quot;Machine Gun McCain&quot;. The two later starred in Elaine May&#x27;s film &quot;Mikey and Nicky&quot; (1976).

&quot;Faces&quot; (1968) was the second film to be both directed and independently financed by Cassavetes. The film starred his wife Gena Rowlands—whom he had married during his struggling actor days—John Marley, Seymour Cassel and Val Avery, as well as several first-time actors, such as lead actress Lynn Carlin and industry fringies like Vince Barbi. It depicts the slow disintegration of a contemporary marriage. The film reportedly took three years to make, and was made largely in the Cassavetes home. &quot;Faces&quot; was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress. Around this time, Cassavetes formed &quot;Faces International&quot; as a distribution company to handle all of his films.

=== 1970s ===

In 1970, Cassavetes directed and acted in &quot;Husbands&quot;, with actors Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara. They played a trio of married men on a spree in New York and London after the funeral of one of their best friends. Cassavetes stated that this was a personal film for him; his elder brother had died at the age of 30.

&quot;Minnie and Moskowitz&quot; (1971), about two unlikely lovers, featured Rowlands and Cassel. &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot; (1974) stars Rowlands as an increasingly troubled housewife. Rowlands received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, while Cassavetes was nominated for Best Director. In &quot;The Killing of a Chinese Bookie&quot; (1976), Gazzara plays a small-time strip-club owner with an out-of-control gambling habit, pressured by mobsters to commit a murder to pay off his debt.

In &quot;Opening Night&quot; (1977), Rowlands plays the lead alongside Cassavetes; the film also stars Gazzara and Joan Blondell. Rowlands portrays an aging film star named Myrtle Gordon, who is working in the theater and suffering a personal crisis. Alone and unloved by her colleagues, afraid of aging and always removed from others due to her stardom, she succumbs to alcohol and hallucinations after witnessing a young fan accidentally die. Ultimately, Gordon fights through it all, delivering the performance of her life in a play. Rowlands won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 28th Berlin International Film Festival for her performance.

=== 1980s ===
Cassavetes directed the film &quot;Gloria&quot; (1980), featuring Rowlands as a Mob who tries to protect an orphan boy whom the Mob wants to kill, which earned her another Best Actress nomination. In 1982, Cassavetes starred in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s &quot;Tempest,&quot; which co-starred Rowlands, Susan Sarandon, Molly Ringwald, Raúl Juliá and Vittorio Gassman.

Cassavetes penned the stage play &quot;Knives&quot;, the earliest version of which he allowed to be published in the 1978 premiere issue of &quot;On Stage&quot;, the quarterly magazine of the American Community Theatre Association, a division of the American Theatre Association. The play was produced and directed as one of his &quot;Three Plays of Love and Hate&quot; at Hollywood, California&#x27;s Center Theater in 1981. The trio of plays included versions of Canadian playwright Ted Allan&#x27;s &quot;The Third Day Comes&quot; and &quot;Love Streams,&quot; the latter of which served as the blueprint for Cassavetes&#x27; 1984 film of the same name.

Cassavetes made the Cannon Films-financed &quot;Love Streams&quot; (1984), which featured him as an aging playboy who suffers the overbearing affection of his recently divorced sister. It was entered into the 34th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Golden Bear. The film is often considered Cassavetes&#x27; &quot;last film&quot; in that it brought together many aspects of his previous films. He despised the film &quot;Big Trouble&quot; (1986), which he took over during filming from Andrew Bergman, who wrote the original screenplay. Cassavetes came to refer to the film as &quot;The aptly titled &#x27;Big Trouble,&#x27;&quot; since the studio vetoed many of his decisions for the film and eventually edited most of it in a way with which Cassavetes disagreed.

In January 1987, Cassavetes was facing health problems, but he wrote the three-act play &quot;Woman of Mystery&quot; and brought it to the stage in May and June at the Court Theatre, Los Angeles.

Cassavetes worked during the last year of his life to produce a last film that was to be titled &quot;She&#x27;s Delovely&quot;. He was in talks with Sean Penn to star, though legal and financial hurdles proved insurmountable and the project was forgotten about until after Cassavetes&#x27; death, when his son Nick finally directed it as &quot;She&#x27;s So Lovely&quot; (1997).

==Filmmaking style==
Cassavetes spent the majority of his directing career working &#x27;off the grid&#x27; and in a communal atmosphere &quot;unfettered by the commercial concerns of Hollywood.&quot; His films aim to capture &quot;small feelings&quot; often repressed by Hollywood filmmaking, emphasizing intimate character examination and relationships rather than plot, backstory, or stylization. He often presented difficult characters whose behaviors were not easily understood, rejecting simplistic psychological or narrative explanations for their actions. Cassavetes also disregarded the &quot;impressionistic cinematography, linear editing, and star-centred scene making&quot; fashionable in Hollywood and art films. Often unable to interest Hollywood studios in financing his work, Cassavetes typically worked with small but dedicated crew of friends and technicians. He said: &quot;The hardest thing for a film-maker, or a person like me, is to find people … who really want to do something.&quot;

Cassavetes worked to create a comfortable and informal environment where actors could freely experiment with their performances and go beyond acting clichés or &quot;programmed behaviors.&quot; He dismissed Method acting as &quot;more a form of psychotherapy than of acting&quot; which resulted in sentimental cliches and self-indulgent emotion. Instead, he held that acting should be an expression of creative joy and exuberance, with emphasis put on the character&#x27;s creation of &quot;masks&quot; in the process of interacting with other people. Cassavetes also said that he strove &quot;to put [actors] in a position where they may make asses of themselves without feeling they&#x27;re revealing things that will eventually be used against them.&quot; He frequently filmed scenes in long, uninterrupted takes, explaining that:The drama of the scenes comes naturally from the real passage of time lived by the actors [...] The camera isn&#x27;t content to just follow the characters&#x27; words and actions. I focus in on specific gestures and mannerisms. It&#x27;s from focusing on these little things—the moods, silences, pauses, or anxious moments—that the form arises.

Cassavetes also rejected the dominance of the director&#x27;s singular vision, instead believing each character must be the actor&#x27;s &quot;individual creation&quot; and refusing to explain the characters to his actors in any significant detail. He claimed that &quot;stylistic unity drains the humanity out of a text [...] The stories of many different and potentially inarticulate people are more interesting than a contrived narrative that exists only in one articulate man&#x27;s imagination.&quot; The manner in which Cassavetes employed improvisation is frequently misunderstood: with the exception of the original version of &quot;Shadows&quot;, his films were tightly scripted. However, he allowed actors to interpret characters in their own way, and often rewrote scripts based on the results of rehearsals and performances. He explained that &quot;I believe in improvising on the basis of the written word and not on undisciplined creativity.&quot;

Cassavetes worked with jazz musicians Charles Mingus and Shafi Hadi to provide the score for &quot;Shadows&quot;. Mingus&#x27;s friend, Diane Dorr-Dorynek, described Cassavetes&#x27; approach to film-making in jazz terms:

The script formed the skeleton around which the actors might change or ad lib lines according to their response to the situation at the moment, so that each performance was slightly different. A jazz musician works in this way, using a given musical skeleton and creating out of it, building a musical whole related to a particular moment by listening to and interacting with his fellow musicians. Jazz musicians working with actors could conceivably provide audiences with some of the most moving and alive theater they have ever experienced.

When asked by André S. Labarthe during the making of &quot;Faces&quot; whether he had the desire to make a musical film, Cassavetes responded he wanted to make only one musical, Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. Cassavetes was passionate about a wide range of music, from jazz to classical to rock, saying &quot;I like all music. It makes you feel like living. Silence is death.&quot;

Cassavetes worked with composer Bo Harwood from 1970 to 1984 on six films in several different capacities, even though Harwood had initially only signed on to do &quot;a little editing&quot; for &quot;Husbands&quot;, and &quot;a little sound editing&quot; for &quot;Minnie and Moskowitz&quot;. Harwood composed poignant music for Cassavetes&#x27; following three films, and was also credited as &quot;Sound&quot; for two of them. During these projects Harwood wrote several songs, some with Cassavetes contributing lyrics and rudimentary tunes. During his work with Cassavetes, Harwood claimed the notoriously unpredictable director preferred to use the &quot;scratch track&quot; version of his compositions, rather than to let Harwood refine and re-record them with an orchestra. Some of these scratch tracks were recorded in Cassavetes&#x27; office, with piano or guitar, as demos, and then eventually ended up in the final film. While this matched the raw, unpolished feel that marks most of Cassavetes&#x27; films, Harwood was sometimes surprised and embarrassed.

The relationship between Harwood and Cassavetes ended amicably. When asked by documentarian Michael Ventura during the making of Cassavetes&#x27; last film &quot;Love Streams&quot;, what he had learned from working with Cassavetes, Harwood replied:
I learned a lot through John. I&#x27;ve done a lot of editing for him. Picture editing, sound editing, music editing, shot sound, composed score, and I&#x27;ve learned a lot about integrity ... I think you know what I mean. You know, thirty years from now, I can say I rode with Billy the Kid.

In honor of Cassavetes’ legacy, artist and author Zara Schuster organised a reading at Cassavetes’ grave on Sunday, October 27th, 2024.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriage ===
Cassavetes was married to American actress Gena Rowlands from 1954 until his death in 1989. Many of his films were shot and edited in his and Rowlands&#x27; own Los Angeles home. He and Rowlands had a son named Nick and two daughters named Alexandra and Zoe, all of whom followed them into acting and filmmaking.

=== Death ===
A long-time alcoholic, Cassavetes died in Los Angeles from complications of cirrhosis at the age of 59 on February 3, 1989. He is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park cemetery in Los Angeles.

At the time of his death, Cassavetes had amassed a collection of more than 40 unproduced screenplays, as well as a novel, &quot;Husbands&quot;. He also left three unproduced plays: &quot;Sweet Talk&quot;, &quot;Entrances and Exits&quot;, and &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;, the last of which, in German translation, was co-produced by Needcompany of Belgium and Burgtheater of Vienna, and premiered on stage at Vienna&#x27;s Akademietheater in 2014.

== Legacy and reception ==

Cassavetes is the subject of several biographies. &quot;Cassavetes on Cassavetes&quot; is a collection of interviews collected or conducted by Boston University film scholar Ray Carney, in which the filmmaker recalled his experiences, influences, and outlook on the film industry. In the 2005 Hollywood issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, one article features a tribute to Cassavetes by three members of his stock company, Rowlands, Gazzara, and Falk.

Many of Cassavetes&#x27; films are owned by Faces Distribution, a company overseen by Gena Rowlands and Julian Schlossberg, distributed by Jumer Films (Schlossberg&#x27;s own company), with additional sales and distribution by Janus Films. In September 2004, The Criterion Collection produced a Region 1 DVD box set of his five independent films: &quot;Shadows&quot;, &quot;Faces&quot;, &quot;A Woman Under the Influence&quot;, &quot;The Killing of a Chinese Bookie&quot; and &quot;Opening Night&quot;. Also featured in the set is a documentary about the life and works of Cassavetes, &quot;A Constant Forge&quot;, a booklet featuring critical assessments of the director&#x27;s work and tributes by old friends. Criterion released a Blu-ray version of the set in October 2013. In 2005, a box set of the same films was released in Region 2 by Optimum Releasing. The Optimum DVD of &quot;Shadows&quot; has a voice-over commentary by Seymour Cassel. Then, in 2014, the Faces/Jumer library became the property of Shout! Factory, which acquired the films&#x27; holding parent company, Westchester Films.

Cassavetes&#x27; son Nick followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as an actor and director, adapting the &quot;She&#x27;s Delovely&quot; screenplay his father had written into the 1997 film &quot;She&#x27;s So Lovely&quot;, which starred Sean Penn, as John Cassavetes had wanted. Alexandra Cassavetes directed the documentary &quot;Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession&quot; in 2004, and in 2006 served as 2nd Unit Director on her brother Nick&#x27;s film, &quot;Alpha Dog&quot;. Cassavetes&#x27; younger daughter Zoe wrote and directed the 2007 film &quot;Broken English&quot;, featuring Rowlands and Parker Posey.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Cassavetes &quot;may be the most influential American director of the last half century&quot;—this in announcing that all the films he directed, plus others he acted in, were being screened in a retrospective tribute at the Brooklyn Academy of Music throughout July 2013. AllMovie called Cassavetes &quot;an iconoclastic maverick&quot;.

The Independent Spirit Awards named one of their categories after Cassavetes, the Independent Spirit John Cassavetes Award. A one-person show about John Cassavetes titled &quot;Independent&quot; premiered at Essential Theatre in Atlanta in August 2017. The play was written by John D. Babcock III and starred actor Dan Triandiflou as Cassavetes. The song &quot;What&#x27;s Yr Take on Cassavetes?&quot; by the band Le Tigre is about misogynistic themes within John Cassavetes&#x27; films and whether they can still be praised after those themes are identified. The song &quot;Cassavetes&quot; by the band Fugazi parallels John Cassavetes&#x27; independence from the film industry with the band&#x27;s own independence from the record industry. In concert, singer Guy Picciotto introduced it as &quot;a song about making your own road.&quot;

<text>The Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) is a medium-sized wild cat native to the northeastern Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and China. It has been listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List since 2008, and is threatened by poaching and habitat destruction, since Southeast Asian forests are undergoing the world&#x27;s fastest regional deforestation.

The Asian golden cat&#x27;s scientific name honours Coenraad Jacob Temminck. It is also called Temminck&#x27;s cat and Asiatic golden cat.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Felis temmincki&quot; was the scientific name used in 1827 by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield who described a reddish brown cat skin from Sumatra.
&quot;Felis moormensis&quot; proposed by Brian Houghton Hodgson in 1831 was a young male cat caught alive by Moormi hunters in Nepal. &quot;Felis tristis&quot; proposed by Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1872 was a spotted Asian golden cat from China.

It was subordinated to the genus &quot;Catopuma&quot; proposed by Nikolai Severtzov in 1853.
Two subspecies are recognised as valid since 2017:
* &quot;C. t. temminckii&quot; occurs in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula
* &quot;C. t. moormensis&quot; occurs from Nepal eastwards to Southeast Asia

=== Phylogeny ===
Phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear DNA in tissue samples from all Felidae species revealed that the evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia in the Miocene around . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at around .
The Asian golden cat forms an evolutionary lineage together with the bay cat (&quot;C. badia&quot;) and the marbled cat (&quot;Pardofelis marmorata&quot;), which diverged from a common ancestor between , based on analysis of their nuclear DNA. Analysis of their mitochondrial DNA indicates a genetic divergence from their common ancestor between .
Both models agree that the marbled cat is the first species of this lineage that diverged, while the Asian golden cat and the bay cat diverged from each other about 

The following cladogram shows the phylogenetic relationships of the Asian golden cat:

==Characteristics==
The Asian golden cat is a medium-sized cat with a head-to-body length of , with a long tail, and is tall at the shoulder. In weight, it ranges from , which is about two or three times that of a domestic cat (&quot;Felis catus&quot;).

The Asian golden cat is polymorphic in colour. Golden, reddish brown and buff brown individuals were recorded in northeastern India and Bhutan.
Reddish brown morphs were recorded in Sumatra.
Melanistic individuals were recorded in the eastern Himalayas, and in Sumatra.
A spotted Asian golden cat with large rosettes on shoulders, flanks and hips was described for the first time based on a specimen from China in 1872. This morph was recorded in China, Bhutan and in West Bengal&#x27;s Buxa Tiger Reserve.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Asian golden cat ranges from eastern Nepal, northeastern India and Bhutan to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, southern China, Malaysia and Sumatra. It prefers forest habitats interspersed with rocky areas and inhabits dry deciduous, subtropical evergreen and tropical rainforests.

Since an individual was caught alive in 1831 in Nepal, the country was thought to be the westernmost part of the Asian golden cat&#x27;s range. In the 21st century, it was photographed in the country in May 2009 in Makalu Barun National Park, at an elevation of . In February 2019, it was also recorded in Gaurishankar Conservation Area at an elevation of .

In India, Asian golden cats were recorded in:
* temperate and subalpine forest in Sikkim&#x27;s Khangchendzonga National Park up to an elevation of ;
* wet hill forest of Buxa Tiger Reserve for the first time in February 2018 at elevations of ;
* open grasslands of Assam&#x27;s Manas National Park;
* the Khasi hills of Meghalaya;
* Mizoram&#x27;s Dampa Tiger Reserve;
* Arunachal Pradesh&#x27;s Talley Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, Pakke Tiger Reserve, Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary and Singchung-Bugun Village Community Reserve.

In Bhutan&#x27;s Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park, it was recorded by camera traps at an elevation of .

In northern Myanmar, it was recorded in Hkakaborazi National Park.
In 2015, it was recorded for the first time in the hill forests of Karen State.

In Laos, it also inhabits bamboo regrowth, scrub and degraded forest from the Mekong plains to at least .

In China, it was recorded in protected areas in the Qinling and Minshan Mountains between 2004 and 2009.

Results of surveys in Sumatra indicated that it is more common than sympatric small cats, suggesting that it is more numerous than thought before the turn of the 21st century. It has been recorded in Kerinci Seblat Gunung Leuser and Bukit Barisan Selatan National Parks.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Asian golden cats are territorial and solitary. Previous observations suggested that they are primarily nocturnal, but a field study on two radio-collared specimens revealed arrhythmic activity patterns dominated by crepuscular and diurnal activity peaks, with much less activity late at night. In the study, the male&#x27;s territory was in size and increased by more than 15% during the rainy season. The female&#x27;s territory was in size. Both cats traveled between only to more than in a day, and were more active in July than in March.
Asian golden cats recorded in northeast India were active during the day with activity peaks around noon.

Asian golden cats can climb trees when necessary. They hunt birds, hares, rodents, reptiles, and small ungulates such as muntjacs and young sambar deer. They are capable of bringing down prey much larger than themselves, such as domestic water buffalo calves. In the mountains of Sikkim, Asian golden cats reportedly prey on ghoral.

Captive Asian golden cats kill small prey with the nape bite typical of cats. They also pluck birds larger than pigeons before beginning to feed. Their vocalizations include hissing, spitting, meowing, purring, growling, and gurgling. Other methods of communication observed in captive Asian golden cats include scent marking, urine spraying, raking trees and logs with claws, and rubbing of the head against various objects – much like a domestic cat.

=== Reproduction ===
Not much is known about the reproductive behavior of this rather elusive cat in the wild. Most of what is known has been learned from cats in captivity. Female Asian golden cats are sexually mature between 18 and 24 months, while males mature at 24 months. Females come into estrus every 39 days, at which time they leave markings and seek contact with the male by adopting receptive postures. During intercourse, the male will seize the skin of the neck of the female with his teeth. After a gestation period of 78 to 80 days, the female gives birth in a sheltered place to a litter of one to three kittens. The kittens weigh at birth, but triple in size over the first eight weeks of life. They are born already possessing the adult coat pattern and open their eyes after six to twelve days. In captivity, they live for up to twenty years.

== Threats ==
The Asian golden cat inhabits some of the fastest developing countries in the world, where it is increasingly threatened by habitat destruction following deforestation, along with a declining ungulate prey base. In Sumatra, it has been reported killed in revenge for preying on poultry. In Southeast Asia and China, it is threatened by poaching for the illegal wildlife trade. This trade has the greatest potential to do maximum harm in minimal time.

=== Illegal wildlife trade ===
Asian golden cats are poached mainly for their fur. In Myanmar, 111 body parts from at least 110 individuals were observed in four markets surveyed between 1991 and 2006. Numbers were significantly greater than those of non-threatened species. Among the observed skins was one with rosettes. Three of the surveyed markets are situated on international borders with China and Thailand and cater to international buyers, although the Asian golden cat is completely protected under the country&#x27;s national legislation. Effective implementation and enforcement of CITES is considered inadequate.

==Conservation==
&quot;Pardofelis temminckii&quot; is included in CITES Appendix I and fully protected over most of its range. Hunting is prohibited in Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Thailand and Vietnam. Hunting is regulated in Laos. No information about protection status is available from Cambodia. In Bhutan, it is protected only within the boundaries of protected areas.

=== In captivity ===
, there were 20 Asian golden cats in eight European zoos participating in the European Endangered Species Programme. The pair in the German Wuppertal Zoo successfully bred in 2007, and in July 2008, two siblings were born and mother-reared. In 2008, a female kitten was also born in the French Parc des Félins. The species is also kept in the Singapore Zoo.

==In culture==
In China, the Asian golden cat is thought to be a kind of leopard and is known as &quot;rock cat&quot; or &quot;yellow leopard&quot;. Different colour phases have different names; those with black fur are called &quot;inky leopards&quot;, and those with spotted coats are called &quot;sesame leopards&quot;.

In some regions of Thailand, the Asian golden cat is called &quot;Seua fai&quot; (; &quot;fire tiger&quot;). According to a regional legend, the burning of an Asian golden cat&#x27;s fur drives tigers away. Eating the flesh is believed to have the same effect. The Karen people believe that carrying a single hair of the cat is sufficient. Many indigenous people believe the cat to be fierce, but in captivity it has been known to be docile and tranquil. In the south, it is called &quot;Kang kude&quot; () and believed to be a fierce animal that can hurt or eat livestock and larger animals such as elephants.

<text>Shechem ( ; , ; ), also spelled Sichem ( ; ) and other variants, was an ancient city in the southern Levant. Mentioned as a Canaanite city in the Amarna Letters, it later appears in the Hebrew Bible as the first capital of the Kingdom of Israel following the split of the United Monarchy. According to , it was located in the tribal territorial allotment of the tribe of Ephraim. Shechem declined after the fall of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The city later regained its importance as a prominent Samaritan center during the Hellenistic period.

Traditionally associated with the city of Nablus, Shechem is now identified with the nearby site of Tell Balata in the Balata al-Balad suburb of the West Bank.

==Geographical position==

Shechem&#x27;s position is indicated in the Hebrew Bible: it lay north of Bethel and Shiloh, on the high road going from Jerusalem to the northern districts (Judges xxi, 19), at a short distance from Michmethath (Joshua 17:7) and of Dothain (Genesis 37:12–17); it was in the hill-country of Ephraim (Joshua 20:7; 21:21; 1 Kings 12:25; 1 Chronicles 6:67; 7:28), immediately below Mount Gerizim (Judges 9:6–7). These indications are substantiated by Josephus, who says that the city lay between Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim, and by the Madaba map, which places its Sykhem between one of its two sets of &quot;Tour Gobel&quot; (Ebal) and the &quot;Tour Garizin&quot; (Garizim). The site of Shechem in patristic sources is almost invariably identified with, or located close to, the town of Flavia Neapolis (Nablus).

==History==
Shechem was a very ancient commercial center due to its position in the middle of vital trade routes through the region. A very old &quot;Way of the Patriarchs&quot; trade route runs in the north–south direction.

===Chalcolithic===
The oldest settlement in Shechem goes back to about five thousand years ago, during the Chalcolithic period (3500-3000 BCE). At that time agriculture was already practiced.

===Early Bronze===
During the Early Bronze Age, activity seems to have moved to the nearby area of Khirbet Makhneh el-Fauqa. Some publications claim that Shechem is mentioned in the third-millennium Ebla tablets, but this has been denied by archaeologists.

===Middle Bronze===

The first substantial building activity at Shechem (Strata XXII-XXI) dates from the Middle Bronze Age IIA (). It became a very substantial Canaanite settlement, and was attacked by Egypt, as mentioned in the Sebek-khu Stele, an Egyptian stele of a noble at the court of Senusret III (c. 1880–1840 BCE). 

====Middle Bronze IIB====
Fortifications were made in the MB IIB (XX-XIX).

===Late Bronze===

In the Amarna Letters of about 1350 BCE, &quot;Šakmu&quot; (i.e., Shechem) was the center of a kingdom carved out by Labaya (or Labayu), a Canaanite warlord who recruited mercenaries from among the Habiru. Labaya was the author of three Amarna letters (EA 252, EA 253, and EA 254), and his name appears in 11 of the other 382 letters, referred to 28 times, with the basic topic of the letter, being Labaya himself, and his relationship with the rebelling, countryside Habiru.

====Late Bronze IIB====
Shechem may be identical to the &quot;Sakama&quot; mentioned in an account dated to the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt (around 1200 BCE). (See Papyrus Anastasi I.)

===Iron Age===
====Iron Age II====
During the Babylonian Captivity (606 to 536 BCE), those Judahites who remained in the Kingdom of Judah re-established the altar at Shechem to keep the Israelite worship system going when access to the Temple in Jerusalem was cut off.

===Classical antiquity===

====Hellenistic Period====
During the Hellenistic and Roman periods, Shechem was the main settlement of the Samaritans, whose religious center stood on Mount Gerizim, just outside the town. 

====Roman Period - Province of Judea====
In 6 CE, Shechem was annexed to the Roman Province of Judea. Of the Samaritans of Sichem not a few rose up in arms on Mt. Gerizim at the time of the Galilean rebellion (67 CE), which was part of the First Jewish–Roman War. The city was very likely destroyed by Sextus Vettulenus Cerialis, during that war.

In 72 CE, a new city, Flavia Neapolis, was built by Vespasian to the west of the old one. This city&#x27;s name was eventually corrupted to the modern Nablus. Josephus, writing in about 90 CE (&quot;Jewish Antiquities&quot; 4.8.44), placed the city between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. Elsewhere he refers to it as Neapolis.

In Emperor Hadrian&#x27;s reign, the temple on Mt. Gerizim was restored and dedicated to Jupiter.

Like Shechem, Neapolis had a very early Christian community, including the early saint Justin Martyr; we hear even of bishops of Neapolis. On several occasions the Christians suffered greatly at the hands of the Samaritans. In 474 the emperor, to avenge what Christians considered an unjust attack by the Samaritans, deprived the latter of Mt. Gerizim and gave it to the Christians, who built on it a church dedicated to the Blessed Virgin.

===Later history===

The city of Nablus was Islamicized in the Abbasid and Ottoman periods. In 1903 near Nablus, a German party of archaeologists led by Dr. Hermann Thiersch stumbled upon the site called Tell Balata and now identified as ancient Shechem. Nablus is still referred to as Shechem by Israeli Hebrew speakers, even though the original site of Shechem lies east of the modern-day city.

==In the Bible==

===Hebrew Bible (Old Testament)===

Shechem first appears in the Hebrew Bible in Genesis 12:6–8, which says that Abraham reached the &quot;great tree of Moreh&quot; at Shechem and offered sacrifice nearby. Genesis, Deuteronomy, Joshua and Judges hallow Shechem over all other cities of the land of Israel. According to Genesis (12:6–7) Abram &quot;built an altar to the Lord who had appeared to him… and had given that land to his descendants&quot; at Shechem. The Bible states that on this occasion, God confirmed the covenant he had first made with Abraham in Harran, regarding the possession of the land of Canaan. In Jewish tradition, the old name was understood in terms of the Hebrew word &quot;shékém&quot; – &quot;shoulder, saddle&quot;, corresponding to the mountainous configuration of the place.

On a later sojourn, two sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, avenged their sister Dinah&#x27;s abduction and rape by &quot;Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land&quot; of Shechem. Shimon and Levi said to the Shechemites that, if &quot;every male among you is circumcised, then we will give our daughters to you and take your daughters to ourselves.&quot; Once the Shechemites agree to the mass circumcision, however, Jacob&#x27;s sons repay them by killing all of the city&#x27;s male inhabitants. This eventually leads to Shimon and Levi not getting a blessing from Jacob as he had disapproved of their actions.

Following the settlement of the Israelites in Canaan after their Exodus from Egypt, according to the biblical narrative, Joshua assembled the Israelites at Shechem and asked them to choose between serving the God of Abraham who had delivered them from Egypt, or the false gods which their ancestors had served on the other side of the Euphrates River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land they now lived. The people chose to serve the God of the Bible, a decision which Joshua recorded in the Book of the Law of God, and he then erected a memorial stone &quot;under the oak that was by&quot; in Shechem. The oak is associated with the Oak of Moreh where Abram had set up camp during his travels in this area.

Shechem and its surrounding lands were given as a Levitical city to the Kohathites.

Owing to its central position, no less than to the presence in the neighborhood of places hallowed by the memory of Abraham (Genesis 12:6, 7; 34:5), Jacob&#x27;s Well (Genesis 33:18–19; 34:2, etc.), and Joseph&#x27;s tomb (Joshua 24:32), the city was destined to play an important part in the history of Israel. Jerubbaal (Gideon), whose home was at Ophrah, visited Shechem, and his concubine who lived there was mother of his son Abimelech (Judges 8:31). She came from one of the leading Shechemite families who were influential with the &quot;Lords of Shechem&quot; (Judges 9:1–3, wording of the New Revised Standard Version and New American Bible Revised Edition).

After Gideon&#x27;s death, Abimelech was made king (Judges 9:1–45). Jotham, the youngest son of Gideon, made an allegorical speech on Mount Gerizim in which he warned the people of Shechem about Abimelech&#x27;s future tyranny (Judges 9:7–20). When the city rose in rebellion three years later, Abimelech took it, utterly destroyed it, and burnt the temple of Baal-berith where the people had fled for safety. The city was rebuilt in the 10th century BC and was probably the capital of Ephraim (1 Kings 4). Shechem was the place appointed, after Solomon&#x27;s death, for the meeting of the people of Israel and the investiture of his son Rehoboam as king; the meeting ended in the secession of the ten northern tribes, and Shechem, fortified by Jeroboam, became the capital of the new kingdom (1 Kings 12:1; 14:17; 2 Chronicles 10:1).

After the kings of Israel moved, first to Tirzah () and later on to Samaria, Shechem lost its importance, and we do not hear of it until after the fall of Jerusalem (587 BC; ). The events connected with the restoration were to bring it again into prominence. When, on his second visit to Jerusalem, Nehemiah expelled the grandson of the high priest Eliashib (probably the Manasse of Josephus, &quot;Antiquities&quot;, XI, vii, viii) and with him the many Jews, priests and laymen, who sided with the rebel, these betook themselves to Shechem; a schismatic temple was then erected on Mount Garizim and thus Shechem became the &quot;holy city&quot; of the Samaritans. The latter, who were left unmolested while the orthodox Jews were chafing under the heavy hand of Antiochus IV (&quot;Antiquities&quot;, XII, v, 5, see also Antinomianism in the Books of the Maccabees) and welcomed with open arms every renegade who came to them from Jerusalem (Antiq., XI, viii, 7), fell about 128 BC before John Hyrcanus, and their temple was destroyed (&quot;Antiquities&quot;, XIII, ix, 1).

The Book of Judith, which is considered scripture to the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and other Christian churches is set in a city called &quot;Bethulia&quot;. Because there is no Bethulia, it is widely assumed that this is a pseudonym for another city. The most common theory is that the city of Bethulia is really Shechem, based on the geography described in the book. The Jewish Encyclopedia went as far as to state that Shechem is the only city to meet all the requirements for Bethulia&#x27;s location, and stated: &quot;The identity of Bethulia with Shechem is thus beyond all question&quot;.

===New Testament===
Shechem is mentioned in The Book of Acts (Acts 7, ).

It is not known whether the Samaritan city of Sychar () in the Gospel of John () refers to Shechem or to another nearby village: &quot;So he came to a Samaritan city called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.&quot;

John 4 () mentions one of the women of Sychar going to Jacob&#x27;s Well. Some scholars believe the location of Sychar is at the foot of Mount Ebal, but other scholars disagree because the proposed location is from Jacob&#x27;s Well, which they think is not close enough for the women of Sychar to have fetched their water there. Based on John 4:15, these scholars have argued that Shechem is the Samaritan city of Sychar described in the Gospel of John.

Some of the inhabitants of Sychar were &quot;Samaritans&quot; who believed in Jesus when he tarried two days in the neighborhood (). Sychar and/or Shechem city must have been visited by the Apostles on their way from Samaria to Jerusalem ().

<text>George Ticknor (August 1, 1791 – January 26, 1871) was an American academician and Hispanist, specializing in the subject areas of languages and literature. He is known for his scholarly work on the history and criticism of Spanish literature.

==Early life and education==

Ticknor was born on August 1, 1791, in Boston, Massachusetts. He received his early education from his father, Elisha Ticknor, former headmaster of the Franklin Grammar School, a grocer, and a founder of the Massachusetts Mutual Fire Insurance Company, the system of free primary schools in Boston, and the first New England savings bank, Provident Institution for Savings.

In 1805, George entered the junior class at Dartmouth College, where he graduated in 1807. During the next three years he studied Latin and Greek with Rev. Dr John Sylvester John Gardiner, rector of Trinity Church, Boston, and a pupil of Dr Samuel Parr. In 1810, Ticknor began the study of law, and he was admitted to the bar in 1813.

==Career==

Ticknor opened an office in Boston, but practiced for only one year, satisfying himself that his vocation, or at least his taste, lay in the direction of letters rather than of law. His father helped finance his studies, and Ticknor traveled to Europe in 1815, studying for nearly two years at the University of Göttingen. He attended the lectures of the university and devoted himself to philological studies, especially to the ancient classics. After that, he remained two years longer in Europe, chiefly on the continent, spending most of his time in the capitals of France, Spain and Portugal, where he conducted critical studies of the national literatures.

In 1817, while still in Europe, Ticknor was selected as Smith professor of French and Spanish languages and literature (a chair founded in 1816), and professor of belles-lettres at Harvard University. In 1819 he returned to the United States, bringing with him a valuable library. He continued to add to this, and in time, it became one of the largest private collections in the country. For the rarity and importance of the books, it was unsurpassed, in some of its departments. His collection of Spanish literature was considered to rival the best private ones in Europe, and his library was also particularly strong in Portuguese literature. Ticknor was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1821.

During his professorship Ticknor advocated the creation of departments, the grouping of students in divisions according to proficiency, and the establishment of the elective system. He also reorganized his department. He suggested improvements in the system of discipline, influenced by his studies of German universities. He greatly extended the range of intellectual culture among the students at the university, where literary instruction had been confined to the classics. He gave long, elaborate courses of lectures on French and Spanish literature. He also entered into a critical analysis of such writers as Dante, Goethe, Milton, and Shakespeare. His lectures were attended by people from outside the college, who were attracted by their interest and by Ticknor&#x27;s reputation as a speaker known for his diction and delivery. In 1828, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Ticknor moved into half of the home built by Thomas Amory at the corner of Beacon and Park Streets in 1829; it became known as the Amory-Ticknor House. In 1835 he resigned his chair after holding it for 15 years, and returned to Europe. In 1836, he was succeeded in the professorship at Harvard by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. While in Europe, in June 1836, Ticknor recorded a frank interview with Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich.

After his return to Europe, Ticknor devoted himself to the chief work of his life, the history and criticism of Spanish literature. It was not fully treated even in Europe, where there was no adequate study of the literature as a whole in Spanish. Both Friedrich Bouterwek and Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi had worked with limited or secondhand resources. Ticknor developed in his college lectures the scheme of his more permanent work, which he published as the &quot;History of Spanish Literature&quot; (New York and London, 3 volumes, 1849). The book addresses Spanish civilization and manners as well as its literature. The &quot;History&quot; is considered exhaustive in scholarship, and direct in style. It gives many illustrative passages from representative works, and copious bibliographical references.

It was soon translated into Spanish (1851–1857) by Pascual de Gayangos y Arce and Enrique de Vedia; into French by Magnabal; and German by Nikolaus Heinrich Julius and Ferdinand Wolf. The second American edition appeared in 1854; the third, corrected and enlarged, in 1863; the fourth, containing the author&#x27;s last revision, in 1872, under the supervision of George Stillman Hillard; and the sixth in 1888.

Ticknor had succeeded his father as a member of the Primary School Board in 1822, and held this position until 1825. He was a trustee of the Boston Athenaeum from 1823 to 1832, and was vice-president in 1833. In addition, he served as a director (1827–1835) and vice-president (1841–1862) of the Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance Company, and a trustee of the Massachusetts General Hospital (1826–1830) and of the Boston Provident Institution for Savings (1838–1850), the bank that his father had helped to found.

He was especially active in the establishment of the Boston Public Library (1852), and served on its board from 1852 to 1866 and as its president in 1865. He spent fifteen months abroad from 1856 to 1857 at his own expense to collect books for the library, and gave the library both money and books. He helped establish the free circulating department. He left his collection of Spanish and Portuguese books and manuscripts to the Boston Public Library, after the manuscripts were famously turned down by Harvard University.

<text>Samuel Parr (26 January 1747 – 6 March 1825), was an English schoolmaster, writer, minister and Doctor of Law. He was known in his time for political writing, and (flatteringly) as &quot;the Whig Johnson&quot;, though his reputation has lasted less well than Samuel Johnson&#x27;s, and the resemblances were at a superficial level; Parr was no prose stylist, even if he was an influential literary figure. A prolific correspondent, he kept up with many of his pupils, and involved himself widely in intellectual and political life.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Parr was born at Harrow on the Hill to Samuel Parr, a surgeon, and his wife Ann. Samuel was a determined and educated man who taught his only son Latin grammar at the age of four. At Easter 1752 Parr was sent to Harrow School as a free scholar, and when he left in the spring 1761, he began to assist his father in his medical practice. His father tried to direct Samuel towards a medical career. Stubbornly, Parr repeatedly turned down offers to extend his medical knowledge. In early November 1762, Parr&#x27;s mother died. Less than a year later, his father married again, this time to Margaret Coxe, much to the displeasure of his son, who was sixteen at the time.

Samuel was eventually allowed to swap medicine for divinity. To this end, Parr entered the University of Cambridge, perhaps as a sizar as his stepmother had suggested or perhaps not. In 1765 he was admitted to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where, as he wrote later, his &quot;tutors were eminently able, and to me uniformly kind&quot;. On 23 January 1766, only a few months into his 14-month stay at Cambridge, Parr&#x27;s father died at the age of 54. Even with financial support from Harrow, money now became a problem, and Parr, unable to continue his studies without going into debt, was forced to leave Cambridge. Because of Cambridge&#x27;s rules regarding bachelorships in divinity, he could claim one after ten years practising and would not have to be a member of the university to do so.

===Teaching career===
Needing both funds and intellectual stimulus, he decided to return to Harrow. From February 1767 to the close of 1771 he served under Robert Carey Sumner (by that time a personal friend) as head assistant at Harrow, where he had Richard Brinsley Sheridan among his pupils and enjoyed an income of about £100 p.a., consisting of £50 salary and about the same amount in fees from private pupils. When the headmaster died in September 1771, Parr immediately applied for the position, but was not selected. Harrow demanded every applicant had a Master of Arts degree; an honorary one was swiftly granted to him from Cambridge, where all of his previous teachers spoke highly of him.

He was ordained deacon by Richard Terrick, Bishop of London, on Christmas Eve 1769, and for a short time he served curacies at the nearby parishes of Willesden and Kingsbury. Parr obtained a licence from the bishop, on 14 October 1771, and he opened a school at Stanmore. Perhaps hastened from need of a female superintendent at the school, he married Jane Marsingale the next month. Despite his taking between 20 and 40 pupils from Harrow with him, the school failed after five years, mainly because it could not compete with the extensive interests of Harrow. During his time there, however, he successfully introduced various curriculum developments, particularly the teaching of English and its grammar (as opposed to purely Latin), on which topic he published his &quot;Introduction to English Grammar&quot;, which appeared in 1765.

In 1776 he was elected to the post of head master of Colchester Royal Grammar School, and moved his family to the town during the spring of 1777. He repaired the buildings that had fallen into decay and he took a house near it for the reception of private boarders. In recognition of his achievements there, a school house was named after him in 1908. Though his stay at the school was short – he left after only twelve or fourteen months, having quarrelled with the trustees – he made two friendships he would keep for life: that of Thomas Twining, curate of Fordham, and of the Rev. Dr. Nathaniel Forster, rector of All Saints near Colchester. He was also ordained priest on 15 March 1775 by Bishop Lowth, another supporter of the teaching of English in schools. At the request of his friend Dr Forster, he entered upon the cures of the Hythe and the Trinity Church in Colchester.

On 1 August 1778, at a full court of mayoralty, Parr was elected master of the grammar school of Norwich and early in the following year moved to the city to start work. Though money remained a concern of Parr&#x27;s, he did manage to find happiness at Norwich, surrounded, as he was, by a group of committed academics. Shortly afterwards he became curate to the Reverend William Tapps, serving the churches of St. George&#x27;s Colgate and St Saviour&#x27;s. Parr, turning his attention to obtaining a doctorate and with one in divinity not forthcoming, swapped his studies to law. The degree of LL.D. was duly conferred on him by the University of Cambridge in 1781.

===Retirement===

Towards the close of 1785, he decided to leave Norwich – principally because his post as headmaster did not pay well but required a great deal of his time. In addition, in 1780, he was presented to the small rectory of Asterby in Lincolnshire, and three years later the vicarage of Hatton near Warwick. The first of these was worth £36 a year; the latter, however, around £100. He duly then resigned the former in favour of his curate at Hatton. These posts gave him both better pay and more free time with which to tutor privately and derive more income from those endeavours.

In late 1788, the installation of the Prince of Wales as regent almost saw Parr become the bishop of Gloucester. William Pitt the Younger had been in power on the authority of George III, but, as the King&#x27;s health worsened, parliament came close (by a matter of weeks) to instating the Prince of Wales as regent. &quot;Prinny&quot;, as he was known, was a supporter of Charles James Fox, who was in turn a friend of Parr&#x27;s; it was likely, therefore, that if the prince had come into power as regent, he would have chosen Fox to be the prime minister; Fox in turn who would have nominated Parr as Bishop of Gloucester. Unfortunately for Parr, the King&#x27;s health improved, and the Regency Bill never passed. The Whigs did grant him a £300 annuity, however, which he needed at times during his retirement.

In 1789 he exchanged the benefice in Hatton for Wadenhoe, Northamptonshire, stipulating to be allowed to reside, as assistant curate, in the parsonage of Hatton, where he took a limited number of pupils. Here he spent the rest of his days, enjoying his excellent library, described by Henry George Bohn in &quot;Bibliotheca Parriana&quot; (1827). His friends Richard Porson and Edmund Henry Barker passed many months in his company.

In later years Parr was prone to bad colds and from two he developed erysipelas. The first he eventually recovered from; the second he did not. He bore a long illness with patience and piety, and died at Hatton parsonage on 6 March 1825. His library was auctioned by R. H. Evans in London on 29 May (and two following days) and 31 October (and seven following days); a copy of the sale catalogue for the first part is held at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.132(8)).

==Political and personal views==
Even amid the terrors of the French Revolution, Parr adhered to Whiggism, and his correspondence included every man of eminence, either literary or political, who adopted the same creed. He was an adamant support of Charles James Fox, and vehemently disliked William Pitt the Younger.

In private life, his model was Johnson. He succeeded in copying Johnson&#x27;s uncouthness and pompous manner, but had neither his humour nor his real authority. He was famous as a writer of epitaphs and wrote inscriptions for the tombs of Burke, Charles Burney, Johnson, Fox and Gibbon.

As for Parr&#x27;s religious views:

My principles, I am sure, will never endanger the church [of England] – my studies, I hope, are such as do not disgrace it – and my actions, I can say with confidence, have ever tended to preserve it from open, and what I conceive to be unjust attacks.
==Writings==

Parr&#x27;s writings fill several volumes, but all may be seen as beneath the reputation which he acquired through the variety of his knowledge and dogmatism of his conversation. The chief of them are his &quot;Characters of Charles James Fox&quot; (1809) and his edited reprint of &quot;Tracts of Warburton and a Warburtonian&quot;, which caused controversy; in his critique of Warburton, he focused on the &quot;worst&quot; written by William Warburton and Richard Hurd, which probably did not deserve to be reprinted, even if they were deliberately being suppressed by their authors. His Latin preface to &quot;The Three Treatises of Bellendenus&quot; should also not be forgotten, regarded, as it was, as a great work of modern Latin.

John Johnstone lists approximately 1500 of Parr&#x27;s correspondents, including two members of the royal family, four archbishops and a vast selection of dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, lords, knights, judges and members of parliament.

In Parr 1813 he wrote the Latin inscription on King Richard&#x27;s Well at the presumed site of the Battle of Bosworth, Shenton.

==Memoirs==
There are two memoirs of his life, one by William Field (1828), the other, with his works and his letters, by John Johnstone (1828); and Edmund Henry Barker published in 1828–1829 two volumes of &quot;Parriana&quot;, a confused mass of information on Parr and his friends. An essay on his life, &quot;Dr. Samuel Parr: or, Whiggism in its relations to literature&quot;, is included in Thomas de Quincey&#x27;s works, vol. v., and a little volume of the &quot;Aphorisms, Opinions and Reflections of the late Dr Parr&quot; appeared in 1826.

<text>Henry George Bohn (4 January 179622 August 1884) was a British publisher. He is principally remembered for the &quot;Bohn&#x27;s Libraries&quot; series which he inaugurated. These were begun in 1846, targeted the mass market, and comprised editions of standard works and translations, dealing with history, science, classics, theology, and archaeology.

==Biography==
Bohn was born in London. He was the son of a German bookbinder who had settled in England. In 1831, he began his career as a dealer in rare books and remainders. In 1841 he issued his &quot;&quot;Guinea&quot; Catalogue&quot; of books, a monumental work containing 23,208 items. Bohn was noted for his book auction sales: one held in 1848 lasted four days, the catalogue comprising twenty folio pages. Printed on this catalogue was the information: &quot;Dinner at 2 o&#x27;clock, dessert at 4, tea at 5, and supper at 10.&quot;

In 1846, he also started publishing &quot;The British Florist; Or, Lady&#x27;s Journal of Horticulture&quot;, which had six volumes with illustrations and plates (coloured).

The name of Bohn is principally remembered by the important &quot;Bohn&#x27;s Libraries&quot; which he inaugurated: these were begun in 1846 and comprised editions of standard works and translations, dealing with history, science, classics, theology, and archaeology, consisting in all of 766 volumes. His authors included Julia Corner, who created educational books about India and China for him in the 1850s.

The reasons for the success of &quot;Bohn&#x27;s Libraries&quot; may have included their marketing to a general mass readership with volumes selling at low prices, their &quot;lack of literary pretensions&quot;, and their &quot;policy of a widespread, but restrained expurgation&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Bohn&#x27;s most useful and laborious undertakings was his revision (6 vols. 1864) of &quot;The Bibliographer&#x27;s Manual of English Literature&quot; (1834) by W. T. Lowndes. The plan includes bibliographical and critical notices, particulars of prices, etc., and a considerable addition to the original work.

It had been one of Bohn&#x27;s ambitions to found a great publishing house, but, finding that his sons had no taste for the trade, he sold his &quot;Bohn&#x27;s Libraries&quot; in 1864 to Messrs. Bell and Daldy, afterwards G. Bell &amp; Sons. At that time the &quot;Bohn&#x27;s Libraries&quot; included more than 600 titles. In subsequent years, he disposed of all his copyrights and business properties, finally realizing £73,000 overall.

Bohn was a man of wide culture and many interests. He himself made considerable contributions to his &quot;Libraries&quot;, he collected pictures, china and ivories, and was a famous rose-grower.

He died at Twickenham and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

==Works==
Among his own works were:
* &quot;The Origin and Progress of Printing&quot; (1857)
* &quot;Biography and Bibliography of Shakespeare&quot; (1863)
* &quot;A Dictionary of Quotations From the English Poets&quot; (1867)
* &quot;Handbook of Proverbs&quot;
* &quot;Handbook of Games&quot;
* &quot;Guide to the Knowledge of Pottery and Porcelain&quot;

Besides his edition of Lowndes&#x27; &quot;Bibliographer&#x27;s Manual&quot;, he developed an edition of Addison&#x27;s works.

<text>William Thomas Lowndes (c. 1798 – 31 July 1843), English bibliographer, was born about 1798, the son of a London bookseller.

His principal work, &quot;The Bibliographer’s Manual of English Literature&quot;—the first systematic work of the kind—was published in four volumes in 1834. It took Lowndes fourteen years to compile, but, despite its merits, brought him neither fame nor money. &quot;For years Lowndes was the national British bibliography.&quot; It is regarded as a &quot;bibliographical classic&quot; although &quot;pleasurably more scattershot than systematic.&quot;

Lowndes, reduced to poverty, subsequently became cataloguer to Henry George Bohn, the bookseller and publisher. In 1839 he published the first parts of &quot;The British Librarian&quot;, designed to supplement his early manual, but owing to failing health did not complete the work.

<text>Friedrich Ludewig Bouterwek (15 April 1766 – 9 August 1828) was a German philosopher and critic, born to a mining director at Oker, Electorate of Saxony; today a district of Goslar in Lower Saxony.

==Life==
Bouterwek studied law and philology under Christian Gottlob Heyne and Johann Georg Heinrich Feder at the University of Göttingen.

After he had finished his studies he was appointed to the Hanover Appellate Court, whilst, backed by Johann Wilhelm Ludwig Gleim, he also gave his debut as an author under the pen name &quot;Ferdinand Adrianow&quot; in the &quot;Göttinger Musenalmanach&quot; published by Gottfried August Bürger. He returned to Göttingen as a lecturer in history, from 1790, however, he became a disciple of Immanuel Kant and published &quot;Aphorismen nach Kants Lehre vorgelegt&quot; (1793) [Aphorismen, den Freunden der Vernunftkritik nach Kantischer Lehre vorgelegt (1793).]. In 1802 he became professor ordinarius of philosophy at Göttingen, where he remained till his death.

As a philosopher, he is interesting for his criticism of the theory of the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; (&quot;Ding-an-sich&quot;, noumenon). For the pure reason, as described in the &quot;Kritik&quot;, the &quot;thing-in-itself&quot; can be only an inconceivable &quot;something-in-general&quot;; any statement about it involves the predication of Reality, Unity and Plurality, which belong not to the absolute thing but to phenomena. On the other hand, the subject is known by the fact of will, and the object by that of resistance; the cognizance of willing is the assertion of absolute reality in the domain of relative knowledge. This doctrine has since been described as absolute Virtualism.

Following this train of thought, Bouterwek left the Kantian position through his opposition to its formalism. In later life he inclined to the views of Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, whose letters to him (published at Göttingen, 1868) shed much light on the development of his thought.

Bouterwek died at Göttingen.

==Work==
His chief philosophical works are:
*&quot;Ideen zu einer allgemeinen Apodiktik&quot; (Göttingen and Halle, 1799)
*&quot;Aesthetik&quot; (Leipzig, 1806; Göttingen, 1815 and 1824)
*&quot;Lehrbuch des philos. Vorkenntnisse&quot; (Göttingen, 1810 and 1820)
*&quot;Lehrbuch der philos Wissenschaften&quot; (Göttingen, 1813 and 1820).
In these works he dissociated himself from the Kantian school. His chief critical work was the &quot;Geschichte der neuern Poesie und Beredsamkeit&quot; (Göttingen, 12 vols., 1801–1819), of which the history of Spanish literature has been published separately in French, Spanish and English. The &quot;Geschichte&quot; is a work of wide learning and generally sound criticism, but it is not of equal merit throughout. He also wrote three novels, &quot;Paulus Septimus&quot; (Halle, 1795), &quot;Graf Donamar&quot; (Göttingen, 1791) and &quot;Ramiro&quot; (Leipzig, 1804), and published a collection of poems (Göttingen, 1802).

<doc id="273808" wikidata="Q5247615" url="?curid=273808" title="Death on the Rock">
<text>&quot;Death on the Rock&quot; was a British television documentary, part of Thames Television&#x27;s current affairs series &quot;This Week&quot;. It was broadcast in 1988. The programme examined the killing of three Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) members in Gibraltar in March 1988 by the British Special Air Service (codenamed &quot;Operation Flavius&quot;). &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; presented evidence that the IRA members were shot without warning or with their hands up. It was condemned by the British government and denounced in the press as sensationalist. After one of its witnesses retracted his statement, &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; became the first individual documentary to be the subject of an independent inquiry, in which it was largely vindicated.

&quot;This Week&quot; began investigating the shootings after it emerged that IRA members were not armed or in possession of a bomb as initially reported. The documentary was broadcast on ITV on 28 April 1988, despite two attempts by the government to have it postponed. Using eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government&#x27;s version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. It concluded by putting its findings to a human rights lawyer, who suggested the government should convene a judicial inquiry. Several newspapers attacked the documentary, accusing it of sensationalism and &quot;trial by television&quot;. They mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary&#x27;s witnesses, accusing her of being a former prostitute and of being anti-British; Proetta later successfully sued several newspapers for libel. Other newspapers accused &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses&#x27; statements and criticised the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) for allowing it to be broadcast.

Most of the programme&#x27;s eyewitnesses repeated the statements to the inquest in Gibraltar, but one—who said he had seen a soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire at the man while he was on the ground—retracted his evidence. As a result, Thames commissioned an independent inquiry—the first independent inquiry into an individual documentary. The Windlesham–Rampton report found that the programme sought to raise questions rather than to reach a conclusion. The authors made several criticisms of the documentary, but overall found it a &quot;trenchant&quot; work of journalism, made in &quot;good faith and without ulterior motives&quot;. Thames lost its broadcasting rights and the IBA was abolished as a result of the Broadcasting Act 1990—decisions which several involved parties believed were influenced by the government&#x27;s anger at &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;.

==Background==
===&quot;This Week&quot;===
&quot;This Week&quot; was a current affairs television series that began in 1956. In 1978, it was renamed &quot;TV Eye&quot; and took on a slightly lighter format; the title &quot;This Week&quot; was restored in 1986, after which it became steadily more journalistic. The programme was broadcast simultaneously across the ITV regions and became a mainstay of ITV&#x27;s current affairs programming. By 1988, the programme had interviewed several prime ministers and leaders of the opposition, including Margaret Thatcher (the incumbent prime minister), who had been interviewed for three full episodes.

===Gibraltar shootings===

On 6 March 1988, three members of an IRA Active Service Unit—Daniel McCann, Mairead Farrell, and Sean Savage—were witnessed parking a car in a car park in Gibraltar; the car park was used as an assembly area for British soldiers preparing for the weekly &quot;changing of the guard&quot; ceremony outside the Convent (the residence of the governor of Gibraltar). The three were suspected by the British authorities of being part of a plot to detonate a car bomb in the car park while it was full of soldiers preparing for the ceremony; while the suspects were walking back towards the Spanish border, they were shot dead by British soldiers, members of the Special Air Service. In the immediate aftermath of the shootings, the British government released a statement to the effect that a large car bomb had been found in Gibraltar, and that three suspected terrorists had been shot dead by the Gibraltar Police. That evening, British television news reported the finding of the alleged car bomb, and added that the IRA members had been involved in a &quot;shootout&quot; with authorities. All of Britain&#x27;s daily newspapers covered the shootings the following morning, several of which cited the size of the alleged car bomb as and wrote that it was &quot;packed with shrapnel&quot;. The same morning, Ian Stewart, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, told BBC Radio 4 that &quot;military personnel were involved&quot; in the shootings, and that &quot;a car bomb was found, which has been defused&quot;.

The following day, Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British foreign secretary, made a statement to the House of Commons regarding the shootings, in which he informed the house that the IRA members were unarmed, and that the car parked in the assembly area did not contain an explosive device. Howe stated that the IRA members &quot;made movements which led the military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police, to conclude that their own lives and the lives of others were under threat&quot;. &quot;In light of this response&quot;, Howe continued, &quot;they were shot&quot; by &quot;military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police&quot;. Subsequent inquiries led to the discovery of a large quantity of explosives in Marbella ( from Gibraltar), along with detonators and timers.

==Investigation==
&quot;This Week&quot; editor, Roger Bolton, initially believed there was little merit in investigating the shootings. Based on the official account of events that was presented in the immediate aftermath of the shootings, Bolton believed that most people would think the IRA members &quot;deserved what they got&quot;. Bolton&#x27;s interest was piqued by Howe&#x27;s statement, and the revelation in it that the deceased were unarmed and were not in possession of a bomb. Shortly afterwards, he dispatched two of &quot;This Week&quot;″s journalists, Julian Manyon and Chris Oxley, to Gibraltar and Spain (respectively) to gather more information on the shootings. Bolton believed that the Milltown Cemetery attack and the corporals killings, two events in Belfast which resulted from the Gibraltar killings, provided &quot;even more compelling reasons&quot; to investigate the shootings; the team considered switching the focus of the programme to the effects the shootings had in Belfast, but decided to continue with the original project.

===Gibraltar===

Oxley was surprised to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings, having been closely involved in the events leading up to them. He grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell&#x27;s and McCann&#x27;s deaths. The Gibraltar coroner, Felix Pizzarello, welcomed &quot;This Week&quot;″s investigation and hoped it would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest. Manyon travelled to Madrid to learn more about the surveillance operation. Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the scene of the shootings and interview any eyewitnesses. The team found two eyewitnesses who were willing to speak on camera—Stephen Bullock, a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife, and Josie Celecia, a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window. Both witnesses&#x27; statements appeared to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings.

The journalists engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles, GC, as a ballistics expert. Styles was a retired British Army officer who had served as a bomb-disposal officer in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. He inspected the car park where Savage had parked the car, then walked through the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members&#x27; most likely route. When asked his opinion by the journalists, Styles cast doubt on the authorities&#x27; stated reasons for the shootings. He explained that, had Savage&#x27;s car contained a substantial bomb, the weight would have been evident on the vehicle&#x27;s springs. Styles also felt that a potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote detonator on account of the buildings between the scenes of the shootings and the likelihood that it would be drowned out by other radio signals in the area. Finally, the journalists asked Styles to examine the scenes of the shootings, including ricochet marks on the pumps at the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot.

As Styles was examining the ricochet marks, Cahn was approached by an elderly woman, who led her to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she gave her account in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the plain-clothed men, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. She believed the three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell&#x27;s handbag. One of the men then crouched over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continued to shoot them. Proetta&#x27;s account of the shooting tallied with conclusions Styles drew from bullet marks at the petrol station. Styles also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed a shooting would be able to describe it so vividly. Proetta&#x27;s account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.

Cahn traced two further witnesses to the shootings—Diana Treacy, who said she had seen the soldiers shooting Savage in the back without warning and continuing to shoot him while he was on the ground, and Kenneth Asquez, who had provided a hand-written, unsigned statement, but was extremely reluctant to be filmed or named as a witness. He had come to the attention of the journalists through another witness, who provided Cahn with a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings. The journalists approached the witness through a second intermediary and received a typed but unsigned affidavit. In both documents, Asquez stated that he had been a passenger in a car that was passing the scene of Savage&#x27;s shooting; he described seeing Savage lying on the ground with a soldier standing over him, and witnessing the soldier shoot Savage &quot;two or three times at point-blank range&quot; while the latter was on the ground. The journalists failed to persuade Asquez to sign his affidavit, but decided to incorporate it into the programme nonetheless.

===Spain===
Julian Manyon met with a spokesman for the Spanish interior ministry, who confirmed that the Spanish authorities had tracked the three IRA members throughout their time in Spain. The Spanish surveillance operation included multiple cars following the suspects&#x27; vehicle, periodically &quot;leap-frogging&quot; each other to avoid attracting attention; use of a helicopter; constant radio communication between the officers involved and police headquarters; and officers monitoring the suspects&#x27; movements at fixed observation posts. The spokesman also told the men that the Spanish authorities kept the British government constantly apprised of the IRA team&#x27;s movements, and that the British were aware of Savage&#x27;s arrival at the Gibraltar border, and allowed the white Renault he was driving to enter the territory.

===Northern Ireland===
&quot;This Week&quot; conducted some of the filming for &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; in Northern Ireland, including the funeral of McCann, Savage, and Farrell. Manyon interviewed Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Féin, who refused to confirm that the three were planning a bomb attack on Gibraltar. The team decided against using Adams&#x27; interview, and only 45 seconds of the footage was used in the final cut. The journalists were keen to show the potential impact of a bomb like the one the IRA had planned to explode in Gibraltar; they initially hoped to film a controlled explosion of a bomb of similar size, but no private contractor would conduct such an experiment without government approval. Instead, &quot;This Week&quot; interviewed Noreen Hill—whose husband was left in a coma as a result of a smaller bombing in Enniskillen in November 1987—to &quot;depict the human tragedy of IRA bombings&quot;.

==Conclusion==

Bolton believed his team had enough to broadcast a documentary about the Gibraltar shootings. The journalists filmed those eyewitnesses who were willing to speak on camera. They also rented a helicopter and, with the assistance of the Spanish police, reconstructed the surveillance operation.

The authorities in Britain and Gibraltar refused to provide any information or to comment on the journalists&#x27; findings. Thus, &quot;This Week&quot; were unable to present their conclusions to a member of the government and broadcast their reaction, as was the usual practice for closing such a documentary. In place of such a conclusion, Bolton approached George Carman—a leading London lawyer specialising in human rights issues—who agreed to be interviewed for the programme.

On 26 April, two days before &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; was due to air, the British government attempted to prevent its broadcast. Howe requested that Lord Thomson, chair of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), force a postponement on the grounds that Howe feared the documentary might prejudice the coroner&#x27;s inquest. Thomson personally viewed &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; before making the final decision to permit its broadcast, with two alterations to the commentary. He later wrote that, &quot;paradoxically&quot;, the decision &quot;was not a difficult one. My colleagues and I saw no reason why the IBA should prevent Thames&#x27; journalists interviewing those who claimed to be eyewitnesses and investigating the affair as numerous other journalists had since the shootings, provided that the criminal record of the terrorists and the enormity of the outrage they planned was made clear and the legal position had been established to our satisfaction&quot;. With a slightly altered rationale—that the documentary could contaminate witness evidence at the inquest—Howe again attempted to prevent the programme&#x27;s broadcast on the day it was due to be shown; after taking legal advice, the IBA upheld its decision to permit the broadcast.

==Broadcast==
Final editing of the programme was still under way while the IBA was considering Howe&#x27;s requests, causing Bolton to worry that it would not be completed in time. The editing was eventually finished just ten minutes before the documentary was due to air. &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; was ultimately broadcast in the United Kingdom on schedule, at 21:00 on 28 April 1988, six weeks after the shootings.
The programme opened with excerpts from two of the interviews prior to the title sequence, followed by an introduction from Jonathan Dimbleby, who told viewers that the evidence presented in the programme was &quot;of critical importance for those who wish to find out what really happened in Gibraltar last month&quot;. The commentary cut to Manyon, who introduced Styles and discussed the impact the IRA&#x27;s bomb would have had, and then to Noreen Hill, whose husband was in a coma as a result of the Enniskillen bombing. Manyon pointed out that the IRA expressed regret after Enniskillen, but that they were by then already planning to attack Gibraltar. Manyon told viewers of the three IRA members&#x27; backgrounds, before introducing an interview with an official from the Spanish Interior Ministry, who discussed the surveillance operation, of which viewers were shown the reconstruction with a voice-over from Manyon. The programme reconstructed Savage&#x27;s movements as he crossed the border into Gibraltar, parked his car in the assembly area for the ceremony and met up with McCann and Farrell, after which it broadcast part of Howe&#x27;s statement to the House of Commons: &quot;Their presence and actions near the parked Renault car gave rise to strong suspicion that it contained a bomb, which appeared to be corroborated by a rapid technical examination of the car&quot;. Manyon explained that the vehicle was later found not to contain a bomb, and introduced Styles, who believed that such an examination would have shown that the car did not contain a bomb, as the weight would have been evident on the vehicle&#x27;s springs.

Manyon continued to narrate as the programme reconstructed the IRA team&#x27;s movements through Gibraltar towards the border until McCann and Farrell reached a petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. &quot;Then, suddenly&quot;, Manyon told viewers, &quot;shots rang out, and in less than a minute all three terrorists were dead—shot by the SAS&quot;. The commentary again cut to Howe&#x27;s statement, after which Manyon detailed &quot;This Week&quot; investigation. He introduced the four eyewitnesses the journalists had discovered (Diana Treacy, Josie Celecia, Stephen Bullock, and Carmen Proetta). Celecia described witnessing McCann and Farrell walking along Winston Churchill Avenue before hearing several shots, and then seeing a soldier continue to fire at the pair while they were on the ground. Proetta told the programme she saw a police car arrive opposite the petrol station, that three armed men in plain clothes then disembarked, jumped across the central barrier, and shot McCann and Farrell while the latter had their hands up. Bullock was interviewed walking the route he had walked on the day of the shootings; his account was of two men in plain clothes shooting McCann and Farrell at very close range and continuing to shoot as the pair fell and while they were on the ground. Treacy, meanwhile, was walking along Landport Lane when Savage ran past her, pursued by at least one soldier. She stated that she did not hear any warning before Savage was shot; she ran away after the shooting began. Asquez was not named in the broadcast; his statement—that he saw a soldier firing at Savage while the latter was on the ground—was read out by an actor.

Styles told Manyon he believed it unlikely that the IRA would have succeeded in detonating a bomb in the assembly area from the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot (a distance of approximately ). Returning to Proetta, the documentary heard her reaction to Howe&#x27;s statement that McCann and Farrell made threatening movements; Proetta believed that the incident was triggered by the siren from the police car on Winston Churchill Avenue. She believed that any movements McCann and Farrell made were in response to the siren, and was adamant that the pair had their hands up when they were shot. Manyon summed up the programme&#x27;s findings:
* no independent witnesses heard a challenge,
* Proetta believed McCann and Farrell were shot with their hands up,
* Treacy saw Savage shot in the back,
* two witnesses claimed to have seen the IRA members &quot;finished off&quot; on the ground,
* Styles believed the authorities should have known the car did not contain a bomb.

Carman, the QC recruited by Bolton, was the last contributor to the documentary. Presented with &quot;This Week&quot; evidence, he disagreed with Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s statement that the inquest would be sufficient to establish the facts of the incident. He opined that a more powerful judicial enquiry, possibly headed by a British High Court judge, would be better equipped to eliminate the inconsistencies between the official version of events and the eyewitness statements. In conclusion, Manyon asked Carman &quot;do you believe this case is so important that the government should take such extraordinary steps in order to clarify the facts?&quot; Carman responded &quot;the programme indicates there are serious, important public issues involved, and speaking as a lawyer, one is always anxious when there is contest on the facts in such important areas, they should be properly and efficiently investigated&quot;. The documentary closed with Jonathan Dimbleby:
==Reaction==
The controversy surrounding &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; was &quot;unsurpassed&quot; in Lord Thomson&#x27;s experience. The morning after the broadcast, the British broadsheets appeared open-minded or moderately favourable to &quot;This Week&quot;; &quot;The Times&quot; believed that &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; &quot;seemed a significant, thoroughly responsible and serious examination of a most disturbing case&quot; and that it &quot;simply raised serious questions and suggested they needed deep examination&quot;. The tabloids berated the programme and its makers. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; main headline read &quot;fury over SAS &#x27;trial by TV&#x27;&quot;, while in an inside article, it called the programme &quot;woefully one-sided&quot;, and accused Bolton of having previously collaborated with the IRA for sensational news stories. Bolton later successfully sued the &quot;Mail&quot; for libel. That evening, Bolton agreed to appear on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Right to Reply&quot;, a show which allowed ordinary viewers to question the makers of controversial television programmes; the programme was pre-recorded, and, unusually, the producers agreed to cut the end of the recording after one of the participants—a former member of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s personal staff claiming to be an impartial viewer—launched an attack on Bolton, in which he accused Bolton of associating with terrorists.

The British tabloid press mounted a campaign against Proetta. The day after the broadcast, the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; printed a story about Proetta&#x27;s husband; the piece—citing the Gibraltar Police press officer—stated that he was a drug smuggler well known to the police. Over the course of the week, several of the tabloids ran stories alleging that Carmen Proetta ran an escort agency and that she was a former prostitute with a criminal record. Several stories also attempted to portray Proetta as anti-British, including one in the broadsheet &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; which said she was one of the 44 people who voted to end the British administration in Gibraltar&#x27;s 1967 referendum. In fact, Proetta had served briefly as a director of a Spanish tour company and had no criminal record in either Spain or Gibraltar; her husband had been convicted for drug possession in Spain and was, at the time of the shootings, facing separate charges for allowing his boat to be used by drug smugglers. Proetta later sued &quot;The Sun&quot; and other newspapers for libel and won substantial damages.

&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; attempted to undermine the programme&#x27;s credibility with its own investigative journalism. Citing &quot;official sources&quot;, the paper told its readers that &quot;This Week&quot;″s account of the shootings was &quot;crucially flawed&quot;, and &quot;bore no resemblance to what happened&quot;. It stated that several of the programme&#x27;s witnesses felt that &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; had misrepresented their statements. Styles was said to be aggrieved that two of his &quot;key opinions&quot; had been omitted from the version broadcast—specifically that what Proetta interpreted as a gesture of surrender may have been an involuntary reaction to the bullets striking the suspects&#x27; bodies, and that the IRA members could still have detonated a bomb in another vehicle parked on the Spanish side of the border. The latter opinion was omitted because the &quot;This Week&quot; team saw little for the IRA to gain by detonating a bomb on Spanish soil; the former was included in the broadcast. Celecia, it alleged, had dismissed Proetta&#x27;s account as &quot;ridiculous&quot;, while Stephen Bullock had contradicted Proetta&#x27;s statement that she had seen plain-clothed soldiers arriving in a police car—testimony &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; believed &quot;destroyed&quot; Proetta&#x27;s evidence. Both witnesses refuted these claims in letters to other newspapers. Bullock had dismissed only one detail in Proetta&#x27;s evidence, while he and Proetta had been referring to two distinct police cars in their statements. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; omitted Styles&#x27; belief that the shootings were a pre-emptive attack. Styles&#x27; view was one of &quot;two active service units waging war [...] taking [the IRA members] out quickly, cleanly, and without other people being hurt—that seems to be the only way&quot;. Several newspapers were critical of the IBA&#x27;s decision to allow the documentary to be broadcast.

==Inquest==
The programme&#x27;s eyewitnesses appeared at the inquest, which began on 6 September. One of the first civilians to give evidence was Allen Feraday, an explosives expert who worked for the Ministry of Defence (MoD); he confirmed Styles&#x27; contribution to the documentary—that the IRA had not been known to use a remote-detonated bomb without a direct line of sight to their target. The various expert witnesses at the inquest disagreed as to whether a detonation signal could have reached the parked Renault from the scenes of the shootings. Four eyewitnesses gave evidence which broadly supported the official version of events; in particular, none saw the soldiers shoot McCann, Savage, or Farrell while they were on the ground. When the witnesses from &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; were called, Stephen Bullock told the coroner that he saw McCann and Savage raise their hands before seeing the SAS shoot them at point-blank range. Josie Celecia&#x27;s statement that she saw a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground was challenged by government lawyers, who pointed out that her account had changed since &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; and that she was unable to identify the soldiers from photographs taken by her husband.

Maxie Proetta told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife&#x27;s testimony, he believed that Farrell&#x27;s gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car he and his wife had seen was one seen by other eyewitnesses further south, and that it was responding to the shootings but Proetta replied that the lawyers&#x27; suggestion did not make sense. Carmen Proetta&#x27;s testimony the following day contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;. She was no longer certain that she had seen the SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground, because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers&#x27; weapons. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta&#x27;s evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; had been shown. When Asquez reluctantly appeared, he retracted the statements he had given to the journalists, which he said he had made up after &quot;pestering&quot; from Major Bob Randall (who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings). The British tabloids covered Asquez&#x27;s retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. However, Asquez&#x27;s statement contained several details that were not released publicly, and which only entered the public domain during the inquest, though, when questioned by the coroner, Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was &quot;a bit confused&quot;. The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.

Following the inquest, the families of McCann, Savage, and Farrell applied to the European Commission of Human Rights for an opinion on whether the authorities&#x27; actions in Gibraltar violated Article 2 (the &quot;right to life&quot;) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR); &quot;This Week&quot; journalists provided statements to the commission regarding the Spanish surveillance operation (the existence of which had been denied by the British authorities at the inquest). The commission&#x27;s report found no violation of Article 2, but referred the case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) for a final decision. The court rejected the families&#x27; submission that the British government had conspired to kill the three, but did find a violation of Article 2 in the defective planning and control of the operation. Nevertheless, the applicants&#x27; claim for damages was dismissed on the grounds that the trio had been killed while preparing an act of terrorism, though it did order the government to pay the applicants&#x27; costs.

Following Asquez&#x27;s retraction of his statement and his allegation that he was pressured into giving a false account of the events he witnessed, the IBA contacted Thames to express its concern and to raise the possibility of an investigation into the making of the documentary. Thames eventually agreed to commission an independent inquiry into the programme (the first such inquiry into an individual programme), to be conducted by two people with no connection to either Thames or the IBA; to that end, Thames engaged Lord Windlesham and Richard Rampton, QC. Windlesham was a Conservative politician, privy councillor, and former minister in the Home Office and then the Northern Ireland Office; he also had experience of television journalism, having previously managed two television companies. Rampton was a leading barrister specialising in media law and libel. The inquiry&#x27;s terms of reference were &quot;to inquire into the making and screening of &#x27;Death on the Rock&#x27;&quot;, including its creation, production, content, and any effect it had had on the inquest.

The report found that the tendency of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and that it did not explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that were not included in the broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses&#x27; statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez&#x27;s statement and the journalists&#x27; decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez&#x27;s refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez&#x27;s refusal to sign the statement.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) made representations to the inquiry that &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; could potentially have had an adverse effect on the inquest on the same grounds that Howe had attempted to delay the broadcast. The first was that the programme might have been seen by members of the inquest jury, and could thus have caused them to reach a conclusion on the shootings before hearing the evidence at the inquest. Considering this submission, the report agreed with the opinions of lawyers consulted by Thames and the IBA that &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; was safe to be broadcast on 28 April 1988. The report considered that Thames withheld distribution of &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; from Gibraltar and Spain specifically to address such concerns, though it was widely discussed in British newspapers (which are widely sold in the territory) and extracts later became available in Gibraltar. The report concluded it was foreseeable that the content of &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; would become known in Gibraltar, but that it would not have prejudiced potential jurors as, in the authors&#x27; opinion, the programme raised one possibility, but did not seek to present it as the only possible version of events. The second was that the programme might have contaminated the evidence presented at the inquest, as witnesses might have been tempted to give false or embellished accounts for the television. The report dismissed this concern; the authors believed that all the eyewitnesses gave honest accounts of what they believed they saw, and pointed out that three had given statements to the Gibraltar Police and two had been interviewed by Gibraltarian and British newspapers prior to being interviewed for &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;.

Overall, Windlesham and Rampton found &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; to be a &quot;trenchant&quot; work of journalism, made in &quot;good faith and without ulterior motives&quot;. In conclusion, the authors believed that &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; proved that &quot;freedom of expression can prevail in the most extensive, and the most immediate, of all the means of mass communication&quot;.

The terms of reference of the report did not invite any recommendations, nor did the authors offer any.

==Impact==
&quot;Death on the Rock&quot; was highly praised within the television industry and went on to win the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary and an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild. In 2000, &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; was placed 92nd by industry professionals in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled by the British Film Institute.

Two other programmes were made about the Gibraltar shootings for British television, both by the BBC. BBC Northern Ireland produced an episode of &quot;Spotlight&quot; which arrived at similar findings to those of &quot;This Week&quot;; Howe attempted to have the programme delayed, using the same rationale with which he requested &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; be postponed. The programme was eventually broadcast, but restricted to Northern Ireland. The BBC&#x27;s flagship current affairs series &quot;Panorama&quot; made a programme about the SAS and its role in the Troubles to coincide with the end of the Gibraltar inquest; it was postponed by BBC executives in the wake of the controversy surrounding &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;.

Academic Christian Potschka described &quot;Death on the Rock&quot; as part of a decade of &quot;unprecedented conflict between government and broadcasters over ... investigative documentaries&quot;. Margaret Thatcher &quot;utterly rejected&quot; the findings of the Windlesham–Rampton report. After the reforms brought in by the Broadcasting Act 1990, the process of bidding for ITV franchises was overhauled in an attempt to introduce greater competition. In the subsequent auction, Thames Television lost its contract; several journalists and former Thames employees speculated that the Act was the government&#x27;s revenge for &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;. &quot;This Week&quot; ceased after Thames lost its franchise. Lord Thomson, chairman of the IBA, believed the dispute between the government and the authority had a &quot;very substantial influence on Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s attitude towards broadcasting policy&quot;, which led her to the belief that Thames&#x27; franchise should not be renewed. The 1990 Act abolished the IBA, which Thomson believed was directly related to the authority&#x27;s decision to permit the showing of &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;.

It was broadcast again in April 1991 as part of the Channel 4 Banned season.

<doc id="273811" wikidata="Q15527838" url="?curid=273811" title="George Stillman Hillard">
<text>George Stillman Hillard (September 22, 1808 – January 21, 1879) was an American lawyer and author. Besides developing his Boston legal practice (with Charles Sumner as a partner), he served in the Massachusetts legislature, edited several Boston journals, and wrote on literature, politics and travel.

==Biography==
Hillard was born at Machias, Maine, on September 22, 1808, and he was educated at the Boston Latin School. After graduating at Harvard College from 1828, he taught in the Round Hill School at Northampton, Massachusetts and attended Northampton Law School. He graduated at the Harvard Law School in 1832, and in 1833 he was admitted to the bar in Boston, where he entered into partnership with Charles Sumner, and developed an extensive legal practice.

Hillard was a Democrat who opposed slavery and supported the Union during the American Civil War. He was a member of the Massachusetts legislature: the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1836, and the Massachusetts Senate in 1850. There he was conspicuous as an orator, and his policies were praised by Daniel Webster. Hillard was a member of the Boston Common Council and served as its president in from July 1, 1846, through July 1, 1847. He was a member of the Massachusetts constitutional convention of 1853, city solicitor for Boston from 1854 until 1856, and in 1866–70 was United States district attorney for Massachusetts.

Beginning in 1837, Hillard rented rooms to Nathaniel Hawthorne, who had recently taken a job at the customhouse in Boston. Around that time, he was a founding member of an informal social group called the Five of Clubs which also included Sumner, author Henry Russell Cleveland (1809–1843), Cornelius Conway Felton, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

Hillard was the first Dean of the Boston University School of Law. He was also the recipient of an honorary LL.D. from Trinity College.

Hillard devoted a large portion of his time to literature. With George Ripley, he edited the &quot;Christian Register&quot;, a Unitarian weekly, beginning in 1833; in 1834, in association with Sumner, he became editor of &quot;The American Jurist&quot; (1829–1843), a legal journal to which Sumner, Simon Greenleaf and Theron Metcalf contributed; and from 1856 to 1861 he was an associate editor of the &quot;Boston Courier&quot;.

He wrote the 19th-century school textbook series Hillard&#x27;s Readers. &quot;He is credited with having instilled a love of good literature, and a knowledge of the best English writers to generations of Americans&quot;.

==Public speaking==
In addition to his oratorical contributions in meetings of the Massachusetts legislature, he gave the July 4 oration in Boston in 1835; a lecture on &quot;Public Instruction in Prussia&quot; (1836); a speech on &quot;The Relation of the Poet to his Age,&quot; at Harvard (1843); he spoke on “Dangers and Duties of the Mercantile Profession” to the Mercantile Library Association (1850); he spoke before the New York New England Society (1851); and he delivered a eulogy on Daniel Webster in 1852. He gave a series of 12 lectures on the “Life and Writings of Milton” as part of the Lowell Institute&#x27;s lecture series for the 1846–47 season.

==Writings==
His publications include:
* memoirs of James Brown and Jeremiah Mason (privately printed)
* a life of Captain John Smith for Sparks&#x27;s “American Biography”
* &quot;The Poetical Works of Edmund Spenser&quot;, with a critical introduction (5 vols., Boston, 1839)
* a translation of François Guizot&#x27;s “Essay on the Character and Influence of George Washington” (1840)
* memoir of Henry Russell Cleveland with a selection from his writings (privately printed, 1845)
* &quot;Memorial of Daniel Webster&quot; (1853)
* &quot;Six Months in Italy&quot; (2 vols., 1853)
* &quot;Selections from the Works of Walter Savage Landor&quot; (1856)

<text>Isidora Dolores Ibárruri Gómez (; 9 December 189512 November 1989), also known as  (&quot;the passionate one&quot; or Passion flower&quot;), was a Spanish Republican politician during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and a communist. She is renowned for her slogan &quot;¡No Pasarán!&quot; (&quot;They shall not pass!&quot;), which she issued during the Battle for Madrid in November 1936.

Ibárruri joined the Spanish Communist Party () when it was founded in 1920. In the 1930s, she became a writer for the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) publication &quot;Mundo Obrero,&quot; and in February 1936, she was elected to the Cortes Generales as a PCE deputy for Asturias. After going into exile from Spain towards the end of the Civil War in 1939, she became General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Spain, a position she held from 1942 to 1960. The Party then named her honorary president of the PCE, a post she held for the rest of her life. Upon her return to Spain in 1977, she was re-elected as a deputy to the Cortes for the same region she had represented from 1936 to 1939 under the Spanish Second Republic.

==Biography==
Dolores Ibárruri was born in 1895 as the eighth of nine children. She had a Basque miner father and a Castilian mother. She grew up in Gallarta but later moved to Somorrostro (Biscay). Gallarta was adjacent to a large siderite mine.

Ibárruri left school at 15 after spending two years preparing for teachers&#x27; college at the encouragement of her schoolmistress. Her parents could not afford further education, so she went to work as a seamstress and later as a housemaid. She became a waitress in the town of Arboleda, the most important urban nucleus in the region of Somorrostro. There, she met Julián Ruiz Gabiña, a union activist and founder of the Socialist Youth of Somorrostro. They married in late 1915, two years after the birth of their first child. The young couple participated in the general strike of 1917, which led to Ruiz returning to jail. During this time, Ibárruri spent nights reading the works of Karl Marx and others found in the library of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Centre in Somorrostro.

Ibárruri wrote her first article in 1918 for the miners&#x27; newspaper &quot;El Minero Vizcaíno&quot;. The article was published during Holy Week and focused on religious hypocrisy, contrasting with the Passion of Christ. Because of the article&#x27;s theme and timing, she signed it with the alias Pasionaria.

In 1920, Ibárruri and the Workers&#x27; Centre joined the newly formed Communist Party of Spain (PCE), and she was named a member of the Provincial Committee of the Basque Communist Party. After ten years of grassroots militancy, she was appointed to the Central Committee of the PCE in 1930.

During this time, Ibárruri had six children. Of her five daughters, four died very young. She &quot;used to relate how her husband made a small coffin out of a crate of fruit.&quot; Her son, Rubén, died at twenty-two during the Battle of Stalingrad. The remaining child, Amaya Ruiz Ibárruri, outlived her mother. She was married to Stalin&#x27;s adopted son, Artyom Sergeyev. In 2008, Amaya resided in the working-class neighbourhood of Ciudad Lineal in Madrid. She died in 2018 at the age of 95.

===In Madrid (1931–1936)===
With the advent of the Second Republic in 1931, Ibárruri moved to Madrid and became the editor of the PCE newspaper . She was arrested for the first time in September 1931. Jailed with common offenders, she persuaded them to begin a hunger strike to secure freedom for political detainees. Following a second arrest in March 1932, she led other inmates in singing &quot;The Internationale&quot; in the visiting room and encouraged them to reject poorly paid menial labor in the prison yard. She wrote two articles from jail: one published by the PCE periodical and the other by . On 17 March 1932, she was elected to the Central Committee of the PCE at the 4th Congress held in Seville.

In 1933, Ibárruri founded , a women&#x27;s organisation opposed to Fascism and war. On 18 April, Soviet astronomer Grigory Neujmin discovered asteroid 1933 HA and named it &quot;Dolores&quot; in her honour. In November, she travelled to Moscow as a delegate of the 13th Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI), which assessed the dangers posed by fascism and the threat of war. The sight of the Russian capital thrilled Ibárruri. &quot;To me, who saw it through the eyes of the soul&quot;, she wrote in her autobiography, &quot;it was the most wonderful city on earth. The construction of socialism was being managed from it. In it were taking shape the earthly dreams of freedom of generations of slaves, outcasts, serfs, and proletarians. From it one could take in and perceive the march of humanity toward communism.&quot; She did not return to Spain until the new year.

In 1934, she attended the First World Meeting of Women against War and Fascism () in Paris. Although the meeting was chaired by Gabrielle Duchêne, president of the French branch of the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, the separate was an organ of the short-lived French Popular Front. Both the and the Front dissolved in 1939.

Toward the end of 1934, Ibárruri and two others spearheaded a risky rescue mission to the mining region of Asturias to bring more than a hundred starving children to Madrid. The parents of these children had been jailed following the failed October Revolution, which was suppressed by General Franco at the behest of the Republican government. Ibárruri succeeded in her mission but was briefly detained in the prisons of Sama de Langreo and Oviedo. To spare her children further anguish, she sent them to the Soviet Union in the spring of 1935.

In 1935, she secretly crossed the Spanish border to attend the 7th World Congress of the Communist International, held from 25 July to 21 August in Moscow. At this Congress, Georgi Dimitrov delivered a keynote speech proposing an alliance with &quot;progressive bourgeois&quot; governments against the fascists. Under this doctrine, the Popular Front would come to power in France in June 1936.
Ibárruri welcomed Dimitrov&#x27;s speech as a vindication of the PCE&#x27;s long-standing position and returned home &quot;full of enthusiasm, determined to do the impossible to achieve a consensus among the various workers&#x27; and democratic organisations of our country.&quot; At the same Congress, she was elected a deputy member of the ECCI and became the second prominent Communist figure in Spain after José Díaz, the secretary-general of the PCE.

In 1936, Ibárruri was jailed for the fourth time after enduring severe abuse from the arresting officers in Madrid. Upon her release, she went to Asturias to campaign for the PCE in the general elections held on 16 February. In these elections, 323,310 ballots were cast. However, &quot;one ballot, one vote&quot; did not apply; each voter could choose up to 13 candidates simultaneously. The PCE received 170,497 votes, enough to secure one seat in Parliament for Dolores Ibárruri. The Popular Front&#x27;s election platform included the release of political prisoners, and La Pasionaria set out to free the detainees in Oviedo immediately.
As soon as the victory of the Popular Front in the elections became known I, already an elect member of Parliament, showed up at the prison of Oviedo the next morning, went to the office of the Director, who had fled in a mad panic because he had behaved like a genuine criminal toward the Asturian prisoners interned after the revolution of October 1934, and there I found the Administrator to whom I said, &quot;Give me the keys because the prisoners must be released this very day.&quot; He replied, &quot;I have not received any orders&quot;, and I answered, &quot;I am a member of the Republic&#x27;s Parliament, and I demand that you hand over the keys immediately to set the prisoners free.&quot; He handed them over and I assure you that it was the most thrilling day of my activist life, opening the cells and shouting, &quot;Comrades, everyone get out!&quot; Truly thrilling. I did not wait for Parliament to sit or for the release order to be given. I reasoned, &quot;We have run on the promise of freedom for the prisoners of the revolution of 1934—we won—today the prisoners go free.&quot;
In the months before the Spanish Civil War, she joined the strikers at the Cadavio mine in Asturias and stood beside poor tenants evicted from a suburb of Madrid. Around this time, Federico García Lorca, La Pasionaria, and friends were chatting and sharing a coffee in a Madrid café when Lorca, who had been observing Ibárruri&#x27;s appearance, told her, &quot;Dolores, you are a woman of grief, of sorrows... I&#x27;m going to write you a poem.&quot; The poet returned to Granada and met his death at the hands of the Nationalists before completing the task.

===Spanish Civil War (1936–1939)===
Ibárruri delivered a series of speeches, some of which were radio broadcasts from Madrid: &quot;Danger! To Arms!&quot; (19 July), &quot;Our Fighters Must Lack for Nothing!&quot; (24 July), &quot;Discipline, Composure, Vigilance!&quot; (29 July), &quot;Restrain the Hand of the Foreign Meddlers!&quot; (30 July), &quot;Fascism Shall Not Pass!&quot; (24 August), &quot;Better to Die Standing Up Than to Live Kneeling Down!&quot; (3 September), &quot;A Salute to Our Militia Women on the Front Line&quot; (4 September), and &quot;Our Battle Cry Has Been Heard by the Whole World&quot; (15 September). It can be inferred that the majority in Madrid rallied to the Republic&#x27;s side, that uncontrolled elements roamed the capital and many rounds of gunfire were wasted out of nerves (29 July), that Nationalist propaganda was more effective (30 July), and that she recognised early on that the war would be lost without foreign aid (24 August). On 2 October, she wrote a revealing letter to her son in Russia, apologising for not having written earlier and describing the harrowing situation: &quot;You cannot even imagine, my son, how savage is the struggle going on in Spain now... Fighting is going on daily and round the clock. And in this fighting, some of our finest and bravest comrades have perished.&quot; She recounted spending many days beside the troops at the front and expressed her concerns about the war&#x27;s outcome: &quot;It is my hope that in spite of all the difficulties, particularly the lack of weapons, we shall still win.&quot; The war became particularly brutal in 1937. Just as the Blitz later drove the Allies to bomb German cities mercilessly, the Nationalist bombardment of open cities spurred Ibárruri (then the newly named fourth vice president of Congress) to demand an equal response from the &quot;progressive bourgeois&quot; government. President Manuel Azaña, an intellectual and writer, was unwilling to flout constitutional or international laws, while Prime Minister Francisco Largo Caballero, a socialist, was reluctant to cooperate with the PCE. The closing lines of her speech signalled her readiness to endorse radical violence.

On 24 February, Stalin forbade the sending of Soviet volunteers to fight in Spain, but he did not recall Alexander Orlov, an Order of Lenin awardee from the NKVD (secret police). Orlov and the NKVD orchestrated the May Days, the conflict that erupted between 3 and 8 May in Barcelona between the Popular Front and the Trotskyist Workers&#x27; Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). The battle resulted in approximately 1,000 fighters being killed and 1,500 injured, though estimates vary. With the annihilation of the POUM, Stalin deprived the fugitive Leon Trotsky of a potential refuge in Spain. Orlov employed the same methods of terror, duplicity, and deception used during the Great Purge (1936–1938).

As a result of the events from 3 to 8 May in Barcelona, the Trotskyists and the Anarchists came to be seen by Ibárruri as the &quot;Fascist enemy within.&quot;
When we point out the need of opposing Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense in the ranks of certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the POUM. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralise our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.

Trotskyism must be rooted out of the proletarian ranks of our Party as one roots out poisonous weeds. The Trotskyists must be rooted out and disposed of like wild beasts, for otherwise every time our men wish to go on the offensive we will not be able to do so due to lawlessness caused by the Trotskyists in the rear. An end must be put to these traitors once and for all so that our men on the front lines can fight without fear of being stabbed in the back.
Ibárruri attributed the events to an &quot;anarcho-Trotskyist&quot; attempt to undermine the Republican government on orders from Franco, acting in concert with Adolf Hitler. She claimed the violence was the culmination of an anarchist plot that included plans to halt train movement and cut all telegraph and telephone lines. She cited an &quot;order [from the Catalan government] to its forces to control the telephone building and disarm all people whom they encounter in the streets without proper authorization&quot; as part of the anarchist scheme. However, she provided no evidence to support these claims, which were widely accepted by fellow Party members at the time but have since been discredited.

The Communist Party alleged that the anarchist &quot;putsch&quot; was motivated by resentment of the centralized military command sought by the Communists and their allies in Lluís Companys&#x27;s Catalan government, as well as a desire to seize political power. The anarchists and Trotskyists viewed the events as an attempt by the Communist Party (in close contact with the Stalinist NKVD) to dominate all revolutionary activity and blamed the Communists for authoritarianism. They contrasted the Communist police state with the egalitarian conditions that existed prior to the May 1937 events.

Ibárruri, Díaz, and the rest of the PCE set out to destroy the Trotskyists.

The remnants of the POUM leadership were put on trial in Barcelona on 11 October 1938. Referring to the arraignments, Ibárruri said: &quot;If there is an adage that says in normal times it is preferable to acquit a hundred guilty ones rather than punish a single innocent one, when the life of a people is in danger, it is better to convict a hundred innocent ones than to acquit a single guilty one.&quot;

On 30 April 1938, Stalin proposed a military alliance to France and Britain, effectively forsaking the Spanish Republic.

===Exile, part I (1939–1960)===
On 6 March 1939, she flew out of Spain under enemy naval fire to the major Algerian port city of Oran, then under French sovereignty. Her arrival surprised the authorities, who hurriedly put her aboard a liner bound for Marseille. The ship&#x27;s captain was a Nationalist sympathiser, but a clandestine Communist cell aboard ensured he did not steer the ship towards Nationalist-held Barcelona. This was the third time Ibárruri had evaded capture by the Nationalists.

Ibárruri was helped in France by the Communists, who sheltered her in Paris under police surveillance (the Communist Party would be outlawed by the government of Édouard Daladier on 26 September). From Paris, she travelled to Moscow and stayed there with Díaz, generals Enrique Líster and Juan Modesto, and others. She was reunited with Amaya and Rubén, who had escaped from a French internment camp at the end of the Spanish Civil War.

The Soviet Union received the refugees warmly. Ibárruri was given an apartment in Díaz&#x27;s building and was assigned a chauffeur to drive her around Moscow. She was also invited to dine at the Dimitrovs&#x27;. She enjoyed attending performances at the Bolshoi Theatre and the Romen Theatre, and was an avid reader. She delighted in witnessing the emancipation of Russian women. She helped other families adapt to their new country and generally felt happy enough to sing on occasion.

Ibárruri worked in the Executive Committee of the Communist International Secretariat at the Communist International Headquarters near the Kremlin. Her work involved the continual evaluation, analysis, and discussion of the progress of Communism outside the Soviet Union. This was complemented by internal discussions within the PCE central committee, which focused on Spain. No serious disagreement existed between the Communist Party of Spain and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union until 1968 over the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. The PCE supported or excused Stalin&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies, including the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 24 August 1939.

In January 1940, La Pasionaria wrote the following praise of Joseph Stalin:

Ibárruri was asked to manage a new short-wave radio station that broadcast news, analysis, and opinion to the citizens of Francoist Spain. The Moscow station was officially named , but in Spain, it was nicknamed &quot;,&quot; (&quot;The Pyrenees one&quot;) partly due to the mistaken belief that it was located in the Pyrenees and partly because the radio itself used the label occasionally. Radio España Independiente began broadcasting on 22 July 1941, one month after Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Initial broadcasts were made from candle-lit basements under sporadic aerial bombardment. Ibárruri recounted that seniors, women, and children kept watch on the terraces of Moscow every night for incendiary bombs dropped by the Luftwaffe. Civilians would pick up the burning sticks with tongs and dunk them in buckets of water.

Many Spanish refugees volunteered to fight alongside the Russians despite Stalin&#x27;s initial disapproval. According to Ibárruri, more than 200 died in battle. On 18 July 1941, she greeted the Spanish 4th Special Unit assigned to the defence of the Kremlin. Elsewhere, from Crimea to Finland, the Spanish Communist volunteers fought as guerrillas behind enemy lines, in the Red Army, or with the Soviet air force; some made it to Berlin, and at least one scouted territory held by the Spanish Nationalist Blue Division.

On 13 October 1941, martial law was declared in Moscow as the German 3rd Panzer Army came within 140 kilometres (87 miles) of the capital. On 16 October, the ECCI was evacuated by train from Moscow to Ufa, the capital of Republic of Bashkortostan. Díaz, who was gravely ill, went south to Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Soviet socialist Republic.

Radio España Independiente now broadcast from Ufa. She used various aliases, such as Antonio de Guevara or Juan de Guernica, presumably to create the impression that the station had an extensive network of commentators and journalists.

On 19 March 1942, Díaz committed suicide. La Pasionaria became secretary-general of the PCE after a brief period of consultations with Stalin.

On 3 September Ibárruri&#x27;s son Rubén Ruiz Ibárruri lost his life fighting heroically at Stalingrad. Asteroid 2423 Ibarruri is named in his honour.

On 1 March 1943, Stalin established the Union of Polish Patriots, and on 15 May, the ECCI annulled the Third International and granted theoretical independence to each national Communist party. Ibárruri agreed with the decision.

On 23 February 1945, La Pasionaria left Moscow for a trip to Tehran, Baghdad and Cairo. In Cairo, she and her party booked passage on the first passenger ship departing from Alexandria, believing it was bound for Marseille. In fact, the ship, part of a British convoy, headed to Boulogne-sur-Mer near the Belgian border. The voyage lasted three months, and she arrived in Paris too late to meet with Juan Negrín, the last president of the Spanish Republic, to work out a common political strategy against Franco.

From 5 to 8 December, the PCE held a central committee plenum in Toulouse where Santiago Carrillo, the former leader of the Unified Socialist Youth in pre-war Spain who had arrived in liberated France in November 1944, &quot;gained control of the PCE,&quot; according to fellow Communist Enrique Líster.

In his book &quot;Así destruyó Carrillo el PCE&quot;, Líster criticised Ibárruri&#x27;s conduct between 1939 and 1945, writing:

The persecution of dissidents within the PCE increased over time.

Interrogations were cruel: &quot;Carrillo and Anton inflicted true terror. Some comrades came to the brink of insanity during the rounds of interrogation, and others were driven to suicide by the despicable accusations made against them.&quot;

The book lists party members who were betrayed or murdered: Juanchu de Portugalete (1944), Gabriel León Trilla (1945; &quot;the decision to eliminate Trilla belongs to Santiago Carrillo and Dolores Ibárruri&quot;), Jesus Hernandez (1946), Lino (1950), Joan Comorera (1954), Monzon, Quiñones, Luis Montero, and Jose el Valenciano. Even generals Modesto and Líster himself were at one point targeted by the PCE leadership, only to be inadvertently saved by Stalin, who praised them in the presence of Ibárruri, Carrillo, and Anton.

During that period the PCE also persecuted members in northwestern Spain. They included Victor Garcia, alias El Brasileño, a local leader in Galicia, and his deputy Teófilo Fernández. Garcia had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the party&#x27;s exiled leadership and was labelled a provocateur. Party documents showed that he was suspected of being a police informant, but historian Lupe Martínez contends that he had been accused of being in contact with Allied forces in helping downed airmen cross into Portugal from France through Galicia. His planned murder was mentioned as early as 1946, but only conducted in 1948. He was shot in the head in a wooded area in the town of Moalde, after which the regional PCE liaison wrote &quot;At last we have hunted him down. This riffraff withstood us like a leech. We managed to catch him in Lalín, from where he directed certain adventurous, uncontrolled groups. He is a provocateur who has given us many troubles; though belatedly, we have eliminated him.&quot; His body was discovered days later and buried in the local cemetery.

===The exile, part II (1960–1977)===
At the 6th Congress of the PCE, held in Prague from 28 to 31 January 1960, 64-year-old Ibárruri ceded the post of secretary-general to Carrillo and accepted the honorary position of president. As confirmation of her retirement from active politics, she wrote her first memoir in 1960. The book, titled &quot;El Único Camino&quot; (The Only Way), was first published in Paris in 1962 and subsequently printed in Moscow in 1963. It was translated into English and published in New York in 1966 under a new title. In her second memoir, &quot;Memorias de Pasionaria, 1939–1977&quot;, Ibárruri notes that the childhood memories recorded in &quot;El Único Camino&quot; came to her in vivid detail.

On 10 November 1961, Ibárruri was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Historical Sciences by Moscow State University for her contributions to the development of Marxist theory. In her acceptance speech, she asserted that class struggle is the motor of history. In 1962, she attended the 10th Congress of the Italian Communist Party, held from 2 to 8 December in Rome, where she met Socialists, Christian-Democrats, and some church representatives. To the clerics, she remarked, &quot;We are not as wicked as you think, and we are not as good as we probably think we are.&quot; 

During the first few months of 1963, Ibárruri unsuccessfully appealed to the Spanish government to spare the life of executive committee member Julián Grimau. Before his execution, Grimau wrote to Ibárruri, saying, &quot;My execution will be the last one.&quot; During the week of 13 May, Ibárruri unveiled a plaque in his honour on Building 11, Block 1, of the newly renamed Grimau Street in Moscow. On 5 December, she arrived in Havana to commemorate the 5th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. Cuban leader Fidel Castro invited Ibárruri to move permanently to the island, but she declined.

On 15 April 1964, Ibárruri spoke at the banquet celebrating Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s 70th birthday. On 30 April, she shared the International Lenin Prize for Strengthening Peace Among Peoples, with three others. On 22 February 1965, Ibárruri requested that the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the Spanish Army, as well as the defence attorney, appear as witnesses at the court martial of former Republican commander Justo López de la Fuente, who had been condemned to twenty-three years in prison. Everyone expected that he would be sentenced to death. Ibárruri held a press conference in Moscow to publicise these actions. On 27 February, the Captain General of the Madrid region annulled the proceedings. However, the initial sentence remained, and López later died in prison.

Sometime in 1965, Ibárruri flew from Paris to Dubrovnik to apologize to Josip Broz Tito as president of the PCE. On 17 May 1948, the Cominform, successor to the ECCI, had expelled Yugoslavia from the community of Socialist countries, and Ibárruri had supported this censure. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, held from 14 to 26 February 1956, had repudiated the charges against Yugoslavia. Now, Ibárruri came face to face with the man she had slandered. She began to apologise profusely, but Tito interrupted her, saying, &quot;Do not vex yourself, Dolores, do not worry. I know very well how things worked in those days. I know it perfectly. Furthermore, believe me, I most likely would have done what you did had I been in your situation.&quot; Ibárruri returned to visit Yugoslavia several times thereafter. In late December 1965, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR awarded Ibárruri the Order of Lenin medal. Between 1930 and 1991, a total of 431,418 decorations were given out, but only seventeen were awarded to foreigners.

Ibárruri chaired the editorial commission that wrote the four volumes of &quot;Guerra y revolución en España, 1936–1939&quot; (War and Revolution in Spain, 1936–1939), which present the PCE&#x27;s view of the Spanish Civil War. The volumes were published between 1966 and 1971.
On 19 April 1969, former Republican general Juan Modesto died in Prague. Ibárruri delivered a brief eulogy. On 6 May 1970, the Spanish right-wing newspaper &quot;ABC&quot; reported that the PCE and the Kremlin had reached a new pact. According to the report, the Spanish party dropped its censure of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in exchange for the Kremlin&#x27;s blessing on the party&#x27;s wish to collaborate with non-Communist parties. The newspaper also reported that PCE president Dolores Ibárruri resided permanently in Moscow, while the secretary-general lived in Italy.

On 8 November 1972, Ibárruri&#x27;s estranged husband, 82-year-old Julián Ruiz Gabiña, returned from a workers&#x27; clinic in Moscow to Somorrostro, expressing a desire &quot;to rest and die in my land.&quot; On 14 March 1974, Ibárruri condemned the execution of 26-year-old Catalan anarchist Salvador Puig Antich on 2 March. She also noted the revolutionary political stance taken by Bishop Antonio Añoveros Ataún of Bilbao, who publicly defended Basque cultural identity and defied Franco&#x27;s decision to remove him. On 20 November 1975, Spanish dictator Franco died. Ibárruri commented laconically, &quot;May the earth rest lightly upon him.&quot; During the week of 17 November, Ibárruri was awarded the Order of the October Revolution. On 14 December, many representatives of Communist parties from around the world gathered in Rome to pay homage to her. The following summer, Ibárruri attended the 3rd Plenary of the Central Committee of the PCE, held 28–31 July 1976 in Rome, under the theme of &quot;national reconciliation.&quot;

On the night of 24 January 1977, a commando unit of Spanish and Italian neo-Fascists killed three Communist labour-rights attorneys, a law student, and a manager at their law office in downtown Madrid; four others were seriously injured. On 16 February, Ibárruri asked the Spanish authorities in Moscow to allow her to return to Spain. She stated that she had travelled outside the USSR many times, that her profession was a publicist and contributor to newspapers and magazines, that she was the president of the PCE, and that she wanted to travel freely to her own country. On 22 February, the still-illegal PCE announced its list of candidates for the general elections on 15 June. Ibárruri was a candidate in two electoral districts, Madrid and Asturias, to ensure her election; Carrillo appeared in three. Despite a climate of fear and insecurity, the Spanish government legalized the PCE on 9 April, but the authorities denied Ibárruri a visa. On 27 April, Julián Ruiz stated that he would not be at the airport to greet his estranged wife, but added, &quot;Nevertheless, she is the mother of my children, and I wish her health and a peaceful life.&quot; The PCE arranged for Ibárruri to land in Madrid with or without a visa on 13 May; however, on 12 May, the authorities relented and provided the visa.

===Back in Madrid (1977–1989)===
At 2:00 p.m. Moscow time on 13 May 1977, Ibárruri left Sheremetyevo Airport aboard an Aeroflot jet after a &quot;very affectionate&quot; send-off from Boris Ponomarev, Mikhail Suslov, three other civilians, and Colonel Sergeyev, the husband of Ibárruri&#x27;s daughter. On the tarmac, a girl in traditional costume offered the departing president of the PCE a bouquet of flowers. At 7:59 p.m. Madrid time, the Aeroflot jetliner landed at Barajas Airport. The PCE did not give her an official welcome, and secretary-general Carrillo was in Seville. Five hundred party members and sympathisers, some waving PCE flags and wearing red berets with a communist insignia, gathered at the airport. They went up to the observation deck to watch and cheer as she landed. Ibárruri then visited the office of the Registrar General of Fuencarral and officially changed her name from Isidora to Dolores.

Ibárruri&#x27;s first campaign rally was held on 23 May at the Exhibition Fairgrounds of Bilbao, where she spoke before 30,000 to 50,000 supporters. She acknowledged feeling tired but volunteered to explain the workings of socialist countries, &quot;where the workers can live very well without capitalism.&quot; However, the emotion of the day exhausted her, and an evening press conference had to be cancelled. The following day, she spoke at the Suárez Puerta Stadium in Avilés in front of &quot;many thousands of workers.&quot; A 20-year-old eyewitness recalled, &quot;The city wore red. &#x27;The Internationale&#x27; was heard everywhere... the atmosphere, the silence when Pasionaria spoke, the explosion of joy that day, are unforgettable memories.&quot; 

On 25 May, at the presentation of his book &quot;Eurocommunism and the State&quot;, Carrillo told a reporter that Ibárruri reminded him of Pablo Iglesias as he knew him as a child—a sick, elderly man who participated very little in party activities and often remained silent during meetings. On 28 May, Ibárruri spoke in Sama de Langreo, and the right-wing newspaper &quot;ABC&quot; admitted that she was drawing &quot;multitudes.&quot; On 30 May, she affirmed in La Felguera that the same spirit which had motivated her in 1936 continued to drive her in support of the PCE and Asturias. On 8 June, a full house (6,000 people according to &quot;ABC&quot;, 8,000 according to &quot;La Vanguardia&quot;) listened to her at the Palacio de los Deportes in Oviedo, the capital of Asturias. The following day, she appeared at the national rally of the party held in the neighbouring province of León.

In the general elections held on 15 June, the Oviedo constituency saw 584,061 votes cast, with a voter turnout rate of 74.6%. The PCE received 60,297 votes (10.5% of the total), securing one seat for Dolores Ibárruri. The party with the most votes was the Spanish Workers&#x27; Socialist Party (31.8%), while the dictatorship&#x27;s party, Falange Española, garnered a mere 0.46%. 

On 13 July at 10:05 a.m., as noted in her memoirs, Ibárruri returned to the Congress chamber she had left forty-one years earlier. Moments later, she took her place in the vice-presidential chair for the inaugural session. The following day, Radio España Independiente aired its final broadcast, number 108,300. On 22 July, the king opened Parliament. Ibárruri participated in the one-minute general standing ovation, though she remained seated. Earlier, as she entered Congress, a 56-year-old man in Falangist uniform gave the Roman salute and heckled her, saying, &quot;Drop dead! If you had any shame, you would not have returned to Spain.&quot;

On 4 August, 87-year-old Ruiz died in a hospital residence in Barakaldo, and Ibárruri attended his funeral. She traveled to Moscow in October to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Russian Revolution and did not return until 21 November.

Her ailing health led to her hospitalization three times during the first nine months after her return. Her age and frail condition prompted the regional branch of the PCE in Asturias to request her retirement and substitution as early as 21 November 1977. However, the central committee argued that her symbolic presence was important, and she served out her full term. On 31 October 1978, she cast a very loud &quot;Yes&quot; vote for the new Spanish Constitution. On 29 December, President Adolfo Suárez dissolved Congress and called new elections for 1 March 1979. The 84-year-old Ibárruri was not a candidate. Her life, along with that of every Communist, was put in danger on 23 February 1981, when Fascist elements of the Spanish armed forces and paramilitary police staged a coup.

Broadly speaking, the remaining years of Ibárruri&#x27;s life were marked by a series of feminist rallies, political gatherings, congresses of the PSUC and PCE, presiding over meetings of the executive committee, and summer holidays in the Soviet Union. Ibárruri denounced Enver Hoxha&#x27;s stance against Khrushchev during the Sino-Soviet Split, describing Hoxha as &quot;a dog that bites the hand that feeds him&quot;. Survivors of the International Brigades came to celebrate her 90th birthday, and the PCE held a party at the Palacio de Deportes in Madrid for 15,000 to 20,000 well-wishers.

In October 1987, Ibárruri requested financial assistance from Congress, as she had not contributed to the national social security program and had no pension. Congress granted her a monthly allowance of 150,000 pesetas (approximately $1,250 in US dollars at the time). On 13 September 1989, she was hospitalized with severe pneumonia. Although she recovered and left the hospital on 15 October, she experienced a relapse on 7 November and died on 12 November at age 93. On 14 November, thousands of people paid homage as her body lay on a catafalque. Among those who paid their respects were veterans of the Civil War, war amputees, and the ambassadors of Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Yugoslavia, and China, as well as the mayor of Madrid. On 16 November, a short cortege carried her body from the PCE headquarters to the Plaza de Colón, where Rafael Alberti and Secretary-General Julio Anguita delivered brief eulogies. She was then driven to Almudena Cemetery and interred near the grave of Pablo Iglesias. Thousands attended her funeral and chanted, &quot;They shall not pass!&quot; The mayors of several townships declared four days of official mourning.

==Monuments and memorials==
Dolores Ibárruri served as inspiration for artist Arthur Dooley, who was commissioned in 1974 by the International Brigade Association of Scotland to create a monument commemorating the 2,100 British volunteers of the International Brigade. These ordinary men and women joined the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War to fight against Franco&#x27;s regime. The monument’s inscription is dedicated to the 534 volunteers who died in the conflict, including 65 from Glasgow, where the monument is situated.

The statue was funded by money raised from Trade Unionists and Labour movement supporters. However, the £3,000 raised was insufficient to cover the artist&#x27;s plans to cast the statue in bronze. Instead, an armature was welded together from scrap iron and covered in fiberglass. The final version of the monument is a stylized female figure representing Dolores Ibárruri, depicted in a long dress, standing with legs apart and arms raised. On the plinth, Dooley carved Dolores&#x27;s famous slogan: &quot;Better to die on your feet than live forever on your knees.&quot; Originally used by the Mexican revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata, Ibárruri gave the phrase new meaning when she used it during the miners&#x27; strike in Asturias, Spain, in 1934.

Over time, the B-listed statue fell into extremely poor condition, generating criticism from the public, elected officials, and trade unionists. A restoration project was carried out between April and August 2010, and the monument was re-dedicated on 23 August 2010 by the Leader of the Council, Bailie Gordon Matheson, and the General Secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Grahame Smith, in the presence of Thomas Watters, 97, a surviving International Brigade veteran. Watters was a veteran of the Scottish Ambulance Unit, which worked on the front lines in Spain to aid wounded fighters and volunteers from around the world.

In February 2017, the People&#x27;s Party of the Basque Country called for a street named after her to be renamed due to her “terrible role in the Spanish Civil War” and her close association with Stalin.

<text>Simon Greenleaf (December 5, 1783 – October 6, 1853), was an American lawyer and jurist. He was born at Newburyport, Massachusetts before moving to New Gloucester where he was admitted to the Cumberland County bar.
==Early life and legal career==
Greenleaf&#x27;s family traces its ancestry back to Edmund Greenleaf, who lived in Ipswich, Suffolk in England before emigrating and settling in Newburyport, Massachusetts. The Greenleaf family flourished in this part of Massachusetts for almost 150 years prior to Simon&#x27;s birth in 1783. Simon&#x27;s father, Moses Greenleaf, married Lydia Parsons, daughter of Rev. Jonathan Parsons of Newburyport. Their son Moses Greenleaf (1777–1834), Simon&#x27;s older brother, became a distinguished surveyor and mapmaker in Maine.

In the 1790s, Simon&#x27;s parents moved to New Gloucester in Maine, leaving him in Newburyport under the care of his grandfather Jonathan Greenleaf. There Simon was educated at the Latin school and studied the Greco-Roman classics. When he turned 16 years old, he rejoined his parents in New Gloucester. In 1801 he joined the law office of Ezekiel Whitman (later the Chief Justice of Maine) and in 1806 was admitted to the Cumberland County bar as a legal practitioner. On 22 Mar 1806, in New Gloucester, he married Hannah Kingman.

He then opened a legal practice at Standish, but six months later relocated to Gray, where he practised for twelve years, and in 1818 moved to Portland. Greenleaf&#x27;s political preferences were aligned with the Federalist Party, and in 1816 he was an unsuccessful candidate for that party in Cumberland County for the Senate. He was reporter of the Supreme Court of Maine from 1820 to 1832, and published nine volumes of &quot;Reports of Cases in the Supreme Court of Maine&quot; (1820–1832).

Greenleaf was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1820.

He was awarded the honorary Doctor of Laws degree by Harvard in 1834. He received the same honor from Amherst in 1845, and again from the University of Alabama in 1852. In 1848, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Professorships==
In 1833, Greenleaf was named to the Royall professorship, and in 1846 succeeded Judge Joseph Story as Dane professor of law at Harvard University. Greenleaf contributed extensively to the development of Harvard Law School, including expansion of the Harvard Law Library. He was retained as chief counsel by the Warren Bridge group in the US Supreme Court case &quot;Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge&quot; 36 U.S. 420 (1837), where the case laid down the rule that public contracts must be construed in favor of states.

In 1848, Greenleaf retired from his active duties, and became professor emeritus. After being for many years president of the Massachusetts Bible Society, he died at Cambridge. Greenleaf&#x27;s well-known work, a &quot;Treatise on the Law of Evidence,&quot; is considered a classic of American jurisprudence.

==Contributions to Christian apologetics==
Greenleaf is an important figure in the development of that Christian school of thought known as legal or juridical apologetics. This school of thought is typified by legally trained scholars applying the canons of legal proof and judicial argument to the defense of Christian belief. Greenleaf&#x27;s &quot;Testimony of the Evangelists&quot; (1846) set the model for many subsequent works by legal apologists. He is distinguished as one who applied the canons of the ancient document rule to establish the authenticity of the gospel accounts, as well as cross-examination principles in assessing the testimony of those who bore witness to the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ. His style of reasoning is reflected in the apologetic works by John Warwick Montgomery (1931-2024), Josh McDowell (1939- ), and Ross Clifford (1951- ).

Several evangelical books and websites portray Greenleaf as an atheist who set out to disprove the Gospels, and claim that instead the evidence for Jesus&#x27; resurrection convinced him to become a Christian. Greenleaf was a devout evangelical Episcopalian, and no evidence exists that he ever doubted the truth of the Gospels.

== Other Writings ==
Greenleaf&#x27;s principal work of legal scholarship is a &quot;Treatise on the Law of Evidence&quot; (3 vols., 1842–1853), and which remained a standard textbook in American law throughout the Nineteenth century. He also published &quot;A Full Collection of Cases Overruled, Denied, Doubted, or Limited in their Application, taken from American and English Reports&quot; (1821). He prepared and published &quot;Reports of Cases Argued and Determined by the Supreme Judicial Court of the State of Maine&quot; in nine volumes (1820–1832). He revised for the American courts William Cruise&#x27;s &quot;Digest of Laws respecting Real Property&quot; (3 vols., 1849–1850). Greenleaf was also the author of &quot;A Brief Inquiry into the Origin and Principles of Free Masonry&quot; (1820), and wrote a memoir of the life of his colleague Joseph Story - &quot;A Discourse Commemorative of the Life and Character of the Hon. Joseph Story&quot; (1845).

Mentioned by actress Marium Carvell, playing Selma Davis, in &quot;Judgment&quot; (a.k.a. Apocalypse IV)

==Simon Greenleaf School of Law==
In 1980 it opened its doors at Trinity Lutheran Church, 4101 Nohl Ranch Rd, Anaheim, CA 92807. In August 1982, it was relocated to 3855 E. La Palma Ave, Anaheim, California 92807 that was named in his honor, The Simon Greenleaf School of Law. This school was founded by the Lutheran theologian-lawyer John Warwick Montgomery. From 1980-88 the law school published a journal named &quot;The Simon Greenleaf Law Review&quot;. In 1997 the law school became part of Trinity International University.

<text>Shaivism (/ɕə͡ɪʋəsampɾəd̪ɑjəh/; ) is one of the major Hindu traditions, which worships Shiva as the Supreme Being. One of the largest Hindu denominations, it incorporates many sub-traditions ranging from devotional dualistic theism such as Shaiva Siddhanta to yoga-orientated monistic non-theism such as Kashmiri Shaivism. It considers both the Vedas and the Agama texts as important sources of theology. According to a 2020 estimate by The World Religion Database (WRD), hosted at Boston University’s Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs (CURA), Shaivism is the second-largest Hindu sect, constituting about 385 million Hindus.

Shaivism developed as an amalgam of pre-Vedic religions and traditions derived from the southern Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta traditions and philosophies, which were assimilated in the non-Vedic Shiva-tradition. In the process of Sanskritisation and the synthesis of Hinduism, starting in the last centuries BCE, these pre-Vedic traditions became aligned with the Vedic deity Rudra and other Vedic deities, incorporating the non-Vedic Shiva-traditions into the Vedic-Brahmanical fold.

Both devotional and monistic Shaivism became popular in the 1st millennium CE, rapidly becoming the dominant religious tradition of many Hindu kingdoms. It arrived in Southeast Asia shortly thereafter, leading to the construction of thousands of Shaiva temples on the islands of Indonesia as well as Cambodia and Vietnam, co-evolving with Buddhism in these regions.

Shaivite theology ranges from Shiva being the creator, preserver, and destroyer to being the same as the Atman (Self) within oneself and every living being. It is closely related to Shaktism, and some Shaivas worship in both Shiva and Shakti temples. It is the Hindu tradition that most accepts ascetic life and emphasizes yoga, and like other Hindu traditions encourages an individual to discover and be one with Shiva within. The followers of Shaivism are called Shaivas or Shaivites.

==Etymology and nomenclature==
Shiva (, ) literally means kind, friendly, gracious, or auspicious. As a proper name, it means &quot;The Auspicious One&quot;.

The word Shiva is used as an adjective in the Rig Veda, as an epithet for several Rigvedic deities, including Rudra. The term Shiva also connotes &quot;liberation, final emancipation&quot; and &quot;the auspicious one&quot;, this adjective sense of usage is addressed to many deities in Vedic layers of literature. The term evolved from the Vedic &quot;Rudra-Shiva&quot; to the noun &quot;Shiva&quot; in the Epics and the Puranas, as an auspicious deity who is the &quot;creator, reproducer and dissolver&quot;.

The Sanskrit word or means &quot;relating to the god Shiva&quot;, while the related beliefs, practices, history, literature and sub-traditions constitute Shaivism.

==Overview==
The reverence for Shiva is one of the pan-Hindu traditions found widely across South Asia predominantly in Southern India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. While Shiva is revered broadly, Hinduism itself is a complex religion and a way of life, with a diversity of ideas on spirituality and traditions. It has no ecclesiastical order, no unquestionable religious authorities, no governing body, no prophet(s) nor any binding holy book; Hindus can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic, or humanist.

Shaivism is a major tradition within Hinduism with a theology that is predominantly related to the Hindu god Shiva. Shaivism has many different sub-traditions with regional variations and differences in philosophy. Shaivism has a vast literature with different philosophical schools ranging from nondualism, dualism, and mixed schools.

==Origins and history==
The origins of Shaivism are unclear and a matter of debate among scholars, as it is an amalgam of pre-Vedic cults and traditions and Vedic culture.

===Indus Valley Civilisation===

Some trace the origins to the Indus Valley Civilisation, which reached its peak around 2500–2000 BCE. Archeological discoveries show seals that suggest a deity that somewhat appears like Shiva. Of these is the Pashupati seal, which early scholars interpreted as someone seated in a meditating yoga pose surrounded by animals, and with horns. This &quot;Pashupati&quot; (Lord of Animals, Sanskrit &#x27;) seal has been interpreted by these scholars as a prototype of Shiva. Gavin Flood characterizes these views as &quot;speculative&quot;, saying that it is not clear from the seal if the figure has three faces, or is seated in a yoga posture, or even that the shape is intended to represent a human figure.

Other scholars state that the Indus Valley script remains undeciphered, and the interpretation of the Pashupati seal is uncertain. According to Srinivasan, the proposal that it is proto-Shiva may be a case of projecting &quot;later practices into archeological findings&quot;. Similarly, Asko Parpola states that other archaeological finds such as the early Elamite seals dated to 3000–2750 BCE show similar figures and these have been interpreted as &quot;seated bull&quot; and not a yogi, and the bull interpretation is likely more accurate.

===Vedic elements===
The &quot;Rigveda&quot; (~1500–1200 BCE) has the earliest clear mention of Rudra (&quot;Roarer&quot;) in its hymns 2.33, 1.43 and 1.114. The text also includes a &quot;Satarudriya&quot;, an influential hymn with embedded hundred epithets for Rudra, that is cited in many medieval era Shaiva texts as well as recited in major Shiva temples of Hindus in contemporary times. Yet, the Vedic literature only presents scriptural theology, but does not attest to the existence of Shaivism.

=== Emergence of Shaivism ===

According to Gavin Flood, &quot;the formation of Śaiva traditions as we understand them begins to occur during the period from 200 BC to 100 AD.&quot; Shiva was originally probably not a Brahmanical god, but eventually came to be incorporated into the Brahmanical fold. The pre-Vedic Shiva acquired a growing prominence as its cult assimilated numerous &quot;ruder faiths&quot; and their mythologies, and the Epics and Puranas preserve pre-Vedic myths and legends of these traditions assimilated by the Shiva-cult. Shiva&#x27;s growing prominence was facilitated by identification with a number of Vedic deities, such as Purusha, Rudra, Agni, Indra, , , among others. The followers of Shiva were gradually accepted into the Brahmanical fold, becoming allowed to recite some of the Vedic hymns.

Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, dated to the 2nd century BCE, mentions the term &quot;Shiva-bhagavata&quot; in section 5.2.76. Patanjali, while explaining Panini&#x27;s rules of grammar, states that this term refers to a devotee clad in animal skins and carrying an &quot;ayah sulikah&quot; (iron spear, trident lance) as an icon representing his god.

The &quot;Shvetashvatara Upanishad&quot; mentions terms such as Rudra, Shiva, and Maheshwaram, but its interpretation as a theistic or monistic text of Shaivism is disputed. The dating of the &quot;Shvetashvatara&quot; is also in dispute, but it is likely a late Upanishad.

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; mentions Shaiva ascetics, such as in chapters 4.13 and 13.140. Other evidence that is possibly linked to the importance of Shaivism in ancient times are in epigraphy and numismatics, such as in the form of prominent Shiva-like reliefs on Kushan Empire era gold coins. However, this is controversial, as an alternate hypothesis for these reliefs is based on Zoroastrian Oesho. According to Flood, coins dated to the ancient Greek, Saka and Parthian kings who ruled parts of the Indian subcontinent after the arrival of Alexander the Great also show Shiva iconography; however, this evidence is weak and subject to competing inferences.

In the early centuries of the common era is the first clear evidence of Pāśupata Shaivism. The inscriptions found in the Himalayan region, such as those in the Kathmandu valley of Nepal suggest that Shaivism (particularly Pāśupata) was established in this region by the 5th century, during the late Guptas era. These inscriptions have been dated by modern techniques to between 466 and 645 CE.

===Puranic Shaivism===

During the Gupta Empire (c. 320–500 CE) the genre of Purāṇa literature developed in India, and many of these Puranas contain extensive chapters on Shaivism – along with Vaishnavism, Shaktism, Smarta Traditions of Brahmins and other topics – suggesting the importance of Shaivism by then.

The most important Shaiva Purāṇas of this period include the &quot;Shiva Purāṇa&quot;, the &quot;Skanda Purāṇa&quot;, and the &quot;Linga Purāṇa&quot;.

===Post-Gupta development===

Most of the Gupta kings, beginning with Chandragupta II (Vikramaditya) (375–413 CE) were known as Parama Bhagavatas or Bhagavata Vaishnavas and had been ardent promoters of Vaishnavism. But following the Huna invasions, especially those of the Alchon Huns circa 500 CE, the Gupta Empire declined and fragmented, ultimately collapsing completely, with the effect of discrediting Vaishnavism, the religion it had been so ardently promoting. The newly arising regional powers in central and northern India, such as the Aulikaras, the Maukharis, the Maitrakas, the Kalacuris or the Vardhanas preferred adopting Shaivism instead, giving a strong impetus to the development of the worship of Shiva. Vaishnavism remained strong mainly in the territories which had not been affected by these events: South India and Kashmir.

In the early 7th century, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang (Huen Tsang) visited India and wrote a memoir in Chinese that mentions the prevalence of Shiva temples all over North Indian subcontinent, including in the Hindu Kush region such as Nuristan. Between the 5th and 11th century CE, major Shaiva temples had been built in central, southern and eastern regions of the subcontinent, including those at Badami cave temples, Aihole, Elephanta Caves, Ellora Caves (Kailasha, cave 16), Khajuraho, Bhuvaneshwara, Chidambaram, Madurai, and Conjeevaram.

Major scholars of competing Hindu traditions from the second half of the 1st millennium CE, such as Adi Shankara of Advaita Vedanta and Ramanuja of Vaishnavism, mention several Shaiva sects, particularly the four groups: Pashupata, Lakulisha, tantric Shaiva and Kapalika. The description is conflicting, with some texts stating the tantric, puranik and Vedic traditions of Shaivism to be hostile to each other while others suggest them to be amicable sub-traditions. Some texts state that Kapalikas reject the Vedas and are involved in extreme experimentation, while others state the Shaiva sub-traditions revere the Vedas but are non-Puranik.

===South India===
Shaivism was the predominant tradition in South India, co-existing with Buddhism and Jainism, before the Vaishnava Alvars launched the Bhakti movement in the 7th century, and influential Vedanta scholars such as Ramanuja developed a philosophical and organizational framework that helped Vaishnavism expand. Though both traditions of Hinduism have ancient roots, given their mention in the epics such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Shaivism flourished in South India much earlier.

The Mantramarga of Shaivism, according to Alexis Sanderson, provided a template for the later though independent and highly influential Pancaratrika treatises of Vaishnavism. This is evidenced in Hindu texts such as the &quot;Isvarasamhita&quot;, &quot;Padmasamhita,&quot; and &quot;Paramesvarasamhita&quot;.
Along with the Himalayan region stretching from Kashmir through Nepal, the Shaiva tradition in South India has been one of the largest sources of preserved Shaivism-related manuscripts from ancient and medieval India. The region was also the source of Hindu arts, temple architecture, and merchants who helped spread Shaivism into southeast Asia in early 1st millennium CE.

There are tens of thousands of Hindu temples where Shiva is either the primary deity or reverentially included in anthropomorphic or aniconic form (lingam, or svayambhu). Numerous historic Shaiva temples have survived in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, parts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Gudimallam is the oldest known lingam and has been dated to between 3rd to 1st-century BCE. It is a carved five feet high stone lingam with an anthropomorphic image of Shiva on one side. This ancient lingam is in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh.

===Southeast Asia===

Shaivism arrived in a major way in southeast Asia from south India, and to much lesser extent into China and Tibet from the Himalayan region. It co-developed with Buddhism in this region, in many cases. For example, in the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas, a few caves include Shaivism ideas. The epigraphical and cave arts evidence suggest that Shaiva Mahesvara and Mahayana Buddhism had arrived in Indo-China region in the Funan period, that is in the first half of the 1st millennium CE. In Indonesia, temples at archaeological sites and numerous inscription evidence dated to the early period (400 to 700 CE), suggest that Shiva was the highest god. This co-existence of Shaivism and Buddhism in Java continued through about 1500 CE when both Hinduism and Buddhism were replaced with Islam, and persists today in the province of Bali.

The Shaivist and Buddhist traditions overlapped significantly in southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia, Cambodia, and Vietnam between the 5th and the 15th century. Shaivism and Shiva held the paramount position in ancient Java, Sumatra, Bali, and neighboring islands, though the sub-tradition that developed creatively integrated more ancient beliefs that pre-existed. In the centuries that followed, the merchants and monks who arrived in Southeast Asia, brought Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Buddhism, and these developed into a syncretic, mutually supporting form of traditions.

====Indonesia====
In Balinese Hinduism, Dutch ethnographers further subdivided &quot;Siwa (shaivaites) Sampradaya&quot;&quot; into five – Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher caste Brahmana men with lower caste women.

==Beliefs and practices==
Shaivism centers around Shiva, but it has many sub-traditions whose theological beliefs and practices vary significantly. They range from dualistic devotional theism to monistic meditative discovery of Shiva within oneself. Within each of these theologies, there are two sub-groups. One sub-group is called Vedic-Puranic, who use the terms such as &quot;Shiva, Mahadeva, Maheshvara and others&quot; synonymously, and they use iconography such as the Linga, Nandi, Trishula (trident), as well as anthropomorphic statues of Shiva in temples to help focus their practices. Another sub-group is called esoteric, which fuses it with abstract &quot;Sivata&quot; (feminine energy) or &quot;Sivatva&quot; (neuter abstraction), wherein the theology integrates the goddess (Shakti) and the god (Shiva) with Tantra practices and Agama teachings. There is a considerable overlap between these Shaivas and the Shakta Hindus.

===Vedic, Puranik, and esoteric Shaivism===
Scholars such as Alexis Sanderson discuss Shaivism in three categories: Vedic, Puranik and non-Puranik (esoteric, tantric). They place Vedic and Puranik together given the significant overlap, while placing Non-Puranik esoteric sub-traditions as a separate category.
* &quot;Vedic-Puranik&quot;. The majority within Shaivism follow the Vedic-Puranik traditions. They revere the Vedas and the Puranas and hold beliefs that span from dualistic theism, such as Shiva Bhakti (devotionalism), to monistic non-theism dedicated to yoga and a meditative lifestyle. This sometimes involves renouncing household life for monastic pursuits of spirituality. The Yoga practice is particularly pronounced in nondualistic Shaivism, with the practice refined into a methodology such as four-fold &quot;upaya&quot;: being pathless (anupaya, iccha-less, desire-less), being divine (sambhavopaya, &quot;jnana&quot;, knowledge-full), being energy (saktopaya, &quot;kriya&quot;, action-full) and being individual (anavopaya).
* &quot;Non-Puranik&quot;. These are esoteric, minority sub-traditions wherein devotees are initiated (&quot;&quot;) into a specific cult they prefer. Their goals vary, ranging from liberation in current life (&quot;mukti&quot;) to seeking pleasures in higher worlds (&quot;bhukti&quot;). Their means also vary, ranging from meditative &quot;atimarga&quot; or &quot;outer higher path&quot; versus those whose means are recitation-driven &quot;mantras&quot;. The &quot;atimarga&quot; sub-traditions include Pashupatas and Lakula. According to Sanderson, the Pashupatas have the oldest heritage, likely from the 2nd century CE, as evidenced by ancient Hindu texts such as the Shanti Parva book of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; epic. The tantric sub-tradition in this category is traceable to post-8th to post-11th century depending on the region of Indian subcontinent, paralleling the development of Buddhist and Jain tantra traditions in this period. Among these are the dualistic Shaiva Siddhanta and Bhairava Shaivas (non-Saiddhantika), based on whether they recognize any value in Vedic orthopraxy. These sub-traditions cherish secrecy, special symbolic formulae, initiation by a teacher and the pursuit of &quot;siddhi&quot; (special powers). Some of these traditions also incorporate theistic ideas, elaborate geometric yantra with embedded spiritual meaning, mantras and rituals.

===Shaivism versus other Hindu traditions===

Shaivism sub-traditions subscribe to various philosophies, are similar in some aspects and differ in others. These traditions compare with Vaishnavism, Shaktism and Smartism as follows:

==Texts==

Over its history, Shaivism has been nurtured by numerous texts ranging from scriptures to theological treatises. These include the Vedas and Upanishads, the Agamas, and the &quot;Bhasya&quot;. According to Gavin Flood – a professor at Oxford University specializing in Shaivism and phenomenology, Shaiva scholars developed a sophisticated theology, in its diverse traditions. Among the notable and influential commentaries by &quot;dvaita&quot; (dualistic) theistic Shaivism scholars were the 8th century Sadyajoti, the 10th century Ramakantha, 11th century Bhojadeva. The dualistic theology was challenged by the numerous scholars of &quot;advaita&quot; (nondualistic, monistic) Shaivism persuasion such as the 8th/9th century Vasugupta, the 10th century Abhinavagupta and 11th century Kshemaraja, particularly the scholars of the Pratyabhijna, Spanda and Kashmiri Shaivism schools of theologians.

===Vedas and Principal Upanishads===
The Vedas and Upanishads are shared scriptures of Hinduism, while the Agamas are sacred texts of specific sub-traditions. The surviving Vedic literature can be traced to the 1st millennium BCE and earlier, while the surviving Agamas can be traced to 1st millennium of the common era. The Vedic literature, in Shaivism, is primary and general, while Agamas are special treatise. In terms of philosophy and spiritual precepts, no Agama that goes against the Vedic literature, states Mariasusai Dhavamony, will be acceptable to the Shaivas. According to David Smith, &quot;a key feature of the Tamil Saiva Siddhanta, one might almost say its defining feature, is the claim that its source lies in the Vedas as well as the Agamas, in what it calls the Vedagamas&quot;. This school&#x27;s view can be summed as,

The &quot;Upanishad&quot; (400–200 BCE) is the earliest textual exposition of a systematic philosophy of Shaivism.

===Shaiva minor Upanishads===
Shaivism-inspired scholars authored 14 Shiva-focussed Upanishads that are called the Shaiva Upanishads. These are considered part of 95 minor Upanishads in the Muktikā Upanishadic corpus of Hindu literature. The earliest among these were likely composed in 1st millennium BCE, while the last ones in the late medieval era.

The Shaiva Upanishads present diverse ideas, ranging from bhakti-style theistic dualism themes to a synthesis of Shaiva ideas with Advaitic (nondualism), Yoga, Vaishnava and Shakti themes.

===Shaiva Agamas===
The Agama texts of Shaivism are another important foundation of Shaivism theology. These texts include Shaiva cosmology, epistemology, philosophical doctrines, precepts on meditation and practices, four kinds of yoga, mantras, meanings and manuals for Shaiva temples, and other elements of practice. These canonical texts exist in Sanskrit and in south Indian languages such as Tamil.

The Agamas present a diverse range of philosophies, ranging from theistic dualism to absolute monism. In Shaivism, there are ten dualistic (dvaita) Agama texts, eighteen qualified monism-cum-dualism (bhedabheda) Agama texts and sixty four monism (advaita) Agama texts. The Bhairava Shastras are monistic, while Shiva Shastras are dualistic.

The Agama texts of Shaiva and Vaishnava schools are premised on existence of Atman (Self) and the existence of an Ultimate Reality (Brahman) which is considered identical to Shiva in Shaivism. The texts differ in the relation between the two. Some assert the dualistic philosophy of the individual Self and Ultimate Reality being different, while others state a Oneness between the two. Kashmir Shaiva Agamas posit absolute oneness, that is God (Shiva) is within man, God is within every being, God is present everywhere in the world including all non-living beings, and there is no spiritual difference between life, matter, man and God. While Agamas present diverse theology, in terms of philosophy and spiritual precepts, no Agama that goes against the Vedic literature, states Dhavamony, has been acceptable to the Shaivas.

==Traditions==

Shaivism is ancient, and over time it developed many sub-traditions. These broadly existed and are studied in three groups: theistic dualism, nontheistic monism, and those that combine features or practices of the two. Sanderson presents the historic classification found in Indian texts, namely &quot;Atimarga&quot; of the Shaiva monks and &quot;Mantramarga&quot; that was followed by both the renunciates (&quot;sannyasi&quot;) and householders (&quot;grihastha&quot;) in Shaivism. Sub-traditions of Shaivas did not exclusively focus on Shiva, but others such as the Devi (goddess) Shaktism.

===Sannyasi Shaiva: Atimarga===
The Atimarga branch of Shaivism emphasizes liberation (salvation) – or the end of all Dukkha – as the primary goal of spiritual pursuits. It was the path for Shaiva ascetics, in contrast to Shaiva householders whose path was described as Mantramarga and who sought both salvation as well as the yogi-siddhi powers and pleasures in life. The Atimarga revered the Vedic sources of Shaivism, and sometimes referred to in ancient Indian texts as Raudra (from Vedic Rudra).

====Pashupata Atimargi====

Pashupata: (IAST: &quot;&quot;) are the Shaivite sub-tradition with the oldest heritage, as evidenced by Indian texts dated to around the start of the common era. It is a monist tradition, that considers Shiva to be within oneself, in every being and everything observed. The Pashupata path to liberation is one of asceticism that is traditionally restricted to Brahmin males. Pashupata theology, according to &quot;Shiva Sutras&quot;, aims for a spiritual state of consciousness where the Pashupata yogi &quot;abides in one&#x27;s own unfettered nature&quot;, where the external rituals feel unnecessary, where every moment and every action becomes an internal vow, a spiritual ritual unto itself.

The Pashupatas derive their Sanskrit name from two words: Pashu (beast) and Pati (lord), where the chaotic and ignorant state, one imprisoned by bondage and assumptions, is conceptualized as the beast, and the Atman (Self, Shiva) that is present eternally everywhere as the Pati. The tradition aims at realizing the state of being one with Shiva within and everywhere. It has extensive literature, and a fivefold path of spiritual practice that starts with external practices, evolving into internal practices and ultimately meditative yoga, with the aim of overcoming all suffering (Dukkha) and reaching the state of bliss (Ananda).

The tradition is attributed to a sage from Gujarat named Lakulisha (~2nd century CE). He is the purported author of the &quot;Pashupata-sutra&quot;, a foundational text of this tradition. Other texts include the bhasya (commentary) on &quot;Pashupata-sutra&quot; by Kaudinya, the &quot;Gaṇakārikā&quot;, &quot;Pañchārtha bhāshyadipikā&quot; and &quot;Rāśikara-bhāshya&quot;. The Pashupatha monastic path was available to anyone of any age, but it required renunciation from four Ashrama (stage) into the fifth stage of &quot;Siddha-Ashrama&quot;. The path started as a life near a Shiva temple and silent meditation, then a stage when the ascetic left the temple and did karma exchange (be cursed by others, but never curse back). He then moved to the third stage of life where he lived like a loner in a cave or abandoned places or Himalayan mountains, and towards the end of his life he moved to a cremation ground, surviving on little, peacefully awaiting his death.

The Pashupatas have been particularly prominent in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Kashmir and Nepal. The community is found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent. In the late medieval era, Pashupatas Shaiva ascetics became extinct.

====Lakula Atimargi====
This second division of the Atimarga developed from the Pashupatas. Their fundamental text too was the Pashupata Sutras. They differed from Pashupata Atimargi in that they departed radically from the Vedic teachings, respected no Vedic or social customs. He would walk around, for example, almost naked, drank liquor in public, and used a human skull as his begging bowl for food. The Lakula Shaiva ascetic recognized no act nor words as forbidden, he freely did whatever he felt like, much like the classical depiction of his deity Rudra in ancient Hindu texts. However, according to Alexis Sanderson, the Lakula ascetic was strictly celibate and did not engage in sex.

Secondary literature, such as those written by Kashmiri Ksemaraja, suggest that the Lakula had their canons on theology, rituals and literature on pramanas (epistemology). However, their primary texts are believed to be lost, and have not survived into the modern era.

===Grihastha and Sannyasi Shaiva: Mantramarga===

&quot;Mantramārga&quot; (Sanskrit: मंत्रमार्ग, &quot;the path of mantras&quot;) has been the Shaiva tradition for both householders and monks. It grew from the Atimarga tradition. This tradition sought not just liberation from &quot;Dukkha&quot; (suffering, unsatisfactoriness), but special powers (&quot;siddhi&quot;) and pleasures (&quot;bhoga&quot;), both in this life and next. The &quot;siddhi&quot; were particularly the pursuit of &quot;Mantramarga&quot; monks, and it is this sub-tradition that experimented with a great diversity of rites, deities, rituals, yogic techniques and mantras. Both the Mantramarga and Atimarga are ancient traditions, more ancient than the date of their texts that have survived, according to Sanderson. Mantramārga grew to become a dominant form of Shaivism in this period. It also spread outside of India into Southeast Asia&#x27;s Khmer Empire, Java, Bali and Cham.

The Mantramarga tradition created the Shaiva Agamas and Shaiva tantra (technique) texts. This literature presented new forms of ritual, yoga and mantra. This literature was highly influential not just to Shaivism, but to all traditions of Hinduism, as well as to Buddhism and Jainism. Mantramarga had both theistic and monistic themes, which co-evolved and influenced each other. The tantra texts reflect this, where the collection contains both dualistic and non-dualistic theologies. The theism in the tantra texts parallel those found in Vaishnavism and Shaktism. Shaiva Siddhanta is a major subtradition that emphasized dualism during much of its history.

Shaivism has had strong nondualistic (advaita) sub-traditions. Its central premise has been that the Atman (Self) of every being is identical to Shiva, its various practices and pursuits directed at understanding and being one with the Shiva within. This monism is close but differs somewhat from the monism found in Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara. Unlike Shankara&#x27;s Advaita, Shaivism monist schools consider Maya as Shakti, or energy and creative primordial power that explains and propels the existential diversity.

Srikantha, influenced by Ramanuja, formulated Shaiva Vishishtadvaita. In this theology, Atman (Self) is not identical with Brahman, but shares with the Supreme all its qualities. Appayya Dikshita (1520–1592), an Advaita scholar, proposed pure monism, and his ideas influenced Shaiva in the Karnataka region. His Shaiva Advaita doctrine is inscribed on the walls of Kalakanthesvara temple in Adaiyappalam (Tiruvannamalai district).

====Shaiva Siddhanta====

The Śaivasiddhānta (&quot;the established doctrine of Shiva&quot;) is the earliest sampradaya (tradition, lineage) of Tantric Shaivism, dating from the 5th century. The tradition emphasizes loving devotion to Shiva, uses 5th to 9th-century Tamil hymns called &quot;Tirumurai&quot;. A key philosophical text of this sub-tradition was composed by 13th-century Meykandar. This theology presents three universal realities: the &quot;pashu&quot; (individual Self), the &quot;pati&quot; (lord, Shiva), and the &quot;pasha&quot; (Self&#x27;s bondage) through ignorance, karma and maya. The tradition teaches ethical living, service to the community and through one&#x27;s work, loving worship, yoga practice and discipline, continuous learning and self-knowledge as means for liberating the individual Self from bondage.

The tradition may have originated in Kashmir where it developed a sophisticated theology propagated by theologians Sadyojoti, Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇakaṇṭha and his son Bhaṭṭa Rāmakaṇṭha (c. 950–1000). However, after the arrival of Islamic rulers in north India, it thrived in the south. The philosophy of Shaiva Siddhanta, is particularly popular in south India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Singapore.

The historic Shaiva Siddhanta literature is an enormous body of texts. The tradition includes both Shiva and Shakti (goddess), but with a growing emphasis on metaphysical abstraction. Unlike the experimenters of Atimarga tradition and other sub-traditions of Mantramarga, states Sanderson, the Shaiva Siddhanta tradition had no ritual offering or consumption of &quot;alcoholic drinks, blood or meat&quot;. Their practices focussed on abstract ideas of spirituality, worship and loving devotion to Shiva as SadaShiva, and taught the authority of the Vedas and Shaiva Agamas. This tradition diversified in its ideas over time, with some of its scholars integrating a non-dualistic theology.

====Nayanars====

By the 7th century, the Nayanars, a tradition of poet-saints in the bhakti tradition developed in ancient Tamil Nadu with a focus on Shiva, comparable to that of the Vaisnava Alvars. The devotional Tamil poems of the Nayanars are divided into eleven collections together known as &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, along with a Tamil Purana called the &quot;Periya Puranam&quot;. The first seven collections are known as the &quot;Tevaram&quot; and are regarded by Tamils as equivalent to the Vedas. They were composed in the 7th century by Sambandar, Appar, and Sundarar.

Tirumular (also spelled or ), the author of the &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; (also spelled &quot;Tirumandiram&quot;) is considered by Tattwananda to be the earliest exponent of Shaivism in Tamil areas. Tirumular is dated as 7th or 8th century by Maurice Winternitz. The &quot;Tirumantiram&quot; is a primary source for the system of Shaiva Siddhanta, being the tenth book of its canon. The &quot;Tiruvacakam&quot; by Manikkavacagar is an important collection of hymns.

====Tantra Diksha traditions====
The main element of all Shaiva Tantra is the practice of diksha, a ceremonial initiation in which divinely revealed mantras are given to the initiate by a Guru.

A notable feature of some &quot;left tantra&quot; ascetics was their pursuit of siddhis (supernatural abilities) and &quot;bala&quot; (powers), such as averting danger (&quot;santih&quot;) and the ability to harm enemies (&quot;abhicarah&quot;). Ganachakras, ritual feasts, would sometimes be held in cemeteries and cremation grounds and featured possession by powerful female deities called Yoginis. The cult of Yoginis aimed to gain special powers through esoteric worship of the Shakti or the feminine aspects of the divine. The groups included sisterhoods that participated in the rites.

Some traditions defined special powers differently. For example, the Kashmiri tantrics explain the powers as &quot;anima&quot; (awareness than one is present in everything), &quot;laghima&quot; (lightness, be free from presumed diversity or differences), &quot;mahima&quot; (heaviness, realize one&#x27;s limit is beyond one&#x27;s own consciousness), &quot;prapti&quot; (attain, be restful and at peace with one&#x27;s own nature), &quot;prakamya&quot; (forbearance, grasp and accept cosmic diversity), &quot;vasita&quot; (control, realize that one always has power to do whatever one wants), &quot;isitva&quot; (self lordship, a yogi is always free). More broadly, the tantric sub-traditions sought nondual knowledge and enlightening liberation by abandoning all rituals, and with the help of reasoning (&quot;yuktih&quot;), scriptures (&quot;sastras&quot;) and the initiating Guru.

====Kashmir Shaivism====
Kashmir Shaivism is an influential tradition within Shaivism that emerged in Kashmir in the 1st millennium CE and thrived in early centuries of the 2nd millennium before the region was overwhelmed by the Islamic invasions from the Hindu Kush region. The Kashmir Shaivism traditions contracted due to Islam except for their preservation by Kashmiri Pandits. The tradition experienced a revival in the 20th century due especially to influence of Swami Lakshmanjoo and his students.

Kashmir Shaivism has been a nondualistic school, and is distinct from the dualistic Shaiva Siddhānta tradition that also existed in medieval Kashmir. A notable philosophy of monistic Kashmiri Shaivism has been the Pratyabhijna ideas, particularly those by the 10th century scholar Utpaladeva and 11th century Abhinavagupta and Kshemaraja. Their extensive texts established the Shaiva theology and philosophy in an advaita (monism) framework. The &quot;Siva Sutras&quot; of 9th century Vasugupta and his ideas about &quot;Spanda&quot; have also been influential to this and other Shaiva sub-traditions, but it is probable that much older Shaiva texts once existed.

A notable feature of Kashmir Shaivism was its openness and integration of ideas from Shaktism, Vaishnavism and Vajrayana Buddhism. For example, one sub-tradition of Kashmir Shaivism adopts Goddess worship (Shaktism) by stating that the approach to god Shiva is through goddess Shakti. This tradition combined monistic ideas with tantric practices. Another idea of this school was &quot;Trika&quot;, or modal triads of Shakti and cosmology as developed by Somananda in the early 10th century.

===Nath===
Nath is a Shaiva subtradition that emerged from a much older Siddha tradition based on Yoga. The Nath consider Shiva as &quot;Adinatha&quot; or the first guru, and it has been a small but notable and influential movement in India whose devotees were called &quot;Yogi&quot; or &quot;Jogi&quot;, given their monastic unconventional ways and emphasis on Yoga.

Nath theology integrated philosophy from Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism traditions. Their unconventional ways challenged all orthodox premises, exploring dark and shunned practices of society as a means to understanding theology and gaining inner powers. The tradition traces itself to 9th or 10th century Matsyendranath and to ideas and organization developed by Gorakshanath. They combined both theistic practices such as worshipping goddesses and their historic Gurus in temples, as well monistic goals of achieving liberation or &quot;jivan-mukti&quot; while alive, by reaching the perfect (&quot;siddha&quot;) state of realizing oneness of self and everything with Shiva.

They formed monastic organisations, and some of them metamorphosed into warrior ascetics to resist persecution during the Islamic rule of the Indian subcontinent.

===Lingayatism===
Lingayatism, also known as Veera Shaivism is a distinct Shaivite religious tradition in India. It was founded by the 12th-century philosopher and statesman Basava and spread by his followers, called Sharanas.

Lingayatism emphasizes qualified monism and bhakti (loving devotion) to Shiva, with philosophical foundations similar to those of the 11th–12th-century South Indian philosopher Ramanuja. Its worship is notable for the iconographic form of &quot;Ishtalinga&quot;, which the adherents wear. Large communities of Lingayats are found in the south Indian state of Karnataka and nearby regions. Lingayatism has its own theological literature with sophisticated theoretical sub-traditions.

They were influential in the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire that reversed the territorial gains of Muslim rulers, after the invasions of the Deccan region first by Delhi Sultanate and later other Sultanates. Lingayats consider their scripture to be &quot;Basava Purana&quot;, which was completed in 1369 during the reign of Vijayanagara ruler Bukka Raya I. Lingayat (Veerashaiva) thinkers rejected the custodial hold of Brahmins over the Vedas and the shastras, but they did not outright reject the Vedic knowledge. The 13th-century Telugu Virashaiva poet Palkuriki Somanatha, the author of the scripture of Lingayatism, for example asserted, &quot;Virashaivism fully conformed to the Vedas and the shastras.&quot;

==Demography and Presence of believers ==

There are no census data available on demographic history or trends for the traditions within Hinduism. Large Shaivite communities exist in the Southern Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh as well as in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttrakhand. In North Indian communities Shaivism is most practiced amongst the Kashmiri Hindus and Paharis of Himalayan belt. Substantial communities are also found in Haryana, Maharashtra and central Uttar Pradesh.
According to Galvin Flood, Shaivism and Shaktism traditions are difficult to separate, as many Shaiva Hindus revere the goddess Shakti regularly. The denominations of Hinduism, states Julius Lipner, are unlike those found in major religions of the world, because Hindu denominations are fuzzy with individuals revering gods and goddesses polycentrically, with many Shaiva and Vaishnava adherents recognizing Sri (Lakshmi), Parvati, Saraswati and other aspects of the goddess Devi. Similarly, Shakta Hindus revere Shiva and goddesses such as Parvati, Durga, Radha, Sita and Saraswati important in Shaiva and Vaishnava traditions.

==Influence==
Shiva is a pan-Hindu god and Shaivism ideas on Yoga and as the god of performance arts (Nataraja) have been influential on all traditions of Hinduism.

Shaivism was highly influential in southeast Asia from the late 6th century onwards, particularly the Khmer and Cham kingdoms of Indochina, and across the major islands of Indonesia such as Sumatra, Java and Bali. This influence on classical Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand continued when Mahayana Buddhism arrived with the same Indians.

In Shaivism of Indonesia, the popular name for Shiva has been &quot;Bhattara Guru&quot;, which is derived from Sanskrit &quot;Bhattaraka&quot; which means &quot;noble lord&quot;. He is conceptualized as a kind spiritual teacher, the first of all Gurus in Indonesian Hindu texts, mirroring the Dakshinamurti aspect of Shiva in the Indian subcontinent. However, the Bhattara Guru has more aspects than the Indian Shiva, as the Indonesian Hindus blended their spirits and heroes with him. Bhattara Guru&#x27;s wife in southeast Asia is the same Hindu deity Durga, who has been popular since ancient times, and she too has a complex character with benevolent and fierce manifestations, each visualized with different names such as Uma, Sri, Kali and others. Shiva has been called Sadasiva, Paramasiva, Mahadeva in benevolent forms, and Kala, Bhairava, Mahakala in his fierce forms. The Indonesian Hindu texts present the same philosophical diversity of Shaivism traditions found on the subcontinent. However, among the texts that have survived into the contemporary era, the more common are of those of Shaiva Siddhanta (locally also called Siwa Siddhanta, Sridanta).

As Bhakti movement ideas spread in South India, Shaivite devotionalism became a potent movement in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Shaivism was adopted by several ruling Hindu dynasties as the state religion (though other Hindu traditions, Buddhism and Jainism continued in parallel), including the Chola, Nayaks(lingayats) and the Rajputs. A similar trend was witnessed in early medieval Indonesia with the Majapahit empire and pre-Islamic Malaya. In the Himalayan Hindu kingdom of Nepal, Shaivism remained a popular form of Hinduism and co-evolved with Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism.

===Shaktism===
The goddess tradition of Hinduism called Shaktism is closely related to Shaivism. In many regions of India, not only did the ideas of Shaivism influence the evolution of Shaktism, but Shaivism also itself was influenced by it and progressively subsumed the reverence for the divine feminine (Devi) as an equal and essential partner of divine masculine (Shiva). The goddess Shakti in eastern states of India is considered the inseparable partner of God Shiva. According to Galvin Flood, the closeness between Shaivism and Shaktism traditions is such that these traditions of Hinduism are at times difficult to separate. Some Shaiva worship in Shiva and Shakti temples.

===Smarta Tradition===
Shiva is a part of the Smarta Tradition, sometimes referred to as Smartism, which is a tradition within Hinduism. The Smartas are associated with the Advaita Vedanta theology, and their practices include the Panchayatana puja, a ritual that incorporates simultaneous reverence for five deities: Shiva, Vishnu, Surya, Devi and Ganesha. The Smartas thus accept the primary deity of Shaivism as a means to their spiritual goals.

Philosophically, the Smarta tradition emphasizes that all idols (murti) are icons of &quot;saguna&quot; Brahman, a means to realizing the abstract Ultimate Reality called nirguna Brahman. The five or six icons are seen by Smartas as multiple representations of the one Saguna Brahman (i.e., a personal God with form), rather than as distinct beings. The ultimate goal in this practice is to transition past the use of icons, then follow a philosophical and meditative path to understanding the oneness of Atman (Self) and Brahman (metaphysical Ultimate Reality) – as &quot;That art Thou&quot;.

Panchayatana puja that incorporates Shiva became popular in medieval India and is attributed to 8th century Adi Shankara, but archaeological evidence suggests that this practice long predates the birth of Adi Shankara. Many Panchayatana mandalas and temples have been uncovered that are from the Gupta Empire period, and one Panchayatana set from the village of Nand (about 24 kilometers from Ajmer) has been dated to belong to the Kushan Empire era (pre-300 CE). According to James Harle, major Hindu temples from 1st millennium CE commonly embedded the &quot;pancayatana&quot; architecture, from Odisha to Karnataka to Kashmir. Large temples often present multiple deities in the same temple complex, while some explicitly include dual representations of deities such as Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu).

===Vaishnavism===

Vaishnava texts reverentially mention Shiva. For example, the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; primarily focuses on the theology of Hindu god Vishnu and his avatars such as Krishna, but it praises Brahma and Shiva and asserts that they are one with Vishnu. The Vishnu Sahasranama in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; list a thousand attributes and epithets of Vishnu. The list identifies Shiva with Vishnu.

Reverential inclusion of Shaiva ideas and iconography are very common in major Vaishnava temples, such as Dakshinamurti symbolism of Shaiva thought is often enshrined on the southern wall of the main temple of major Vaishnava temples in peninsular India. Harihara temples in and outside the Indian subcontinent have historically combined Shiva and Vishnu, such as at the Lingaraj Mahaprabhu temple in Bhubaneshwar, Odisha. According to Julius Lipner, Vaishnavism traditions such as Sri Vaishnavism embrace Shiva, Ganesha and others, not as distinct deities of polytheism, but as polymorphic manifestation of the same supreme divine principle, providing the devotee a polycentric access to the spiritual.

Similarly, Shaiva traditions have reverentially embraced other gods and goddesses as manifestation of the same divine. The &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, for example in section 6.254.100 states, &quot;He who is Shiva is Vishnu, he who is Vishnu is Sadashiva.&quot;

===Sauraism (Sun deity)===
The sun god called &quot;Surya&quot; is an ancient deity of Hinduism, and several ancient Hindu kingdoms particularly in the northwest and eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent revered Surya. These devotees called Sauras once had a large corpus of theological texts, and Shaivism literature reverentially acknowledges these. For example, the Shaiva text &quot;Srikanthiyasamhita&quot; mentions 85 Saura texts, almost all of which are believed to have been lost during the Islamic invasion and rule period, except for large excerpts found embedded in Shaiva manuscripts discovered in the Himalayan mountains. Shaivism incorporated Saura ideas, and the surviving Saura manuscripts such as &quot;Saurasamhita&quot; acknowledge the influence of Shaivism, according to Alexis Sanderson, assigning &quot;itself to the canon of Shaiva text &quot;Vathula-Kalottara&quot;.

===Yoga movements===

Yoga and meditation have been an integral part of Shaivism, and it has been a major innovator of techniques such as those of Hatha Yoga. Many major Shiva temples and Shaiva &quot;tritha&quot; (pilgrimage) centers, as well as Shaiva texts, depict anthropomorphic iconography of Shiva as a giant statue wherein Shiva is a lone yogi meditating.

In several Shaiva traditions such as the Kashmir Shaivism, anyone who seeks personal understanding and spiritual growth has been called a Yogi. The &quot;Shiva Sutras&quot; (aphorisms) of Shaivism teach yoga in many forms. According to Mark Dyczkowski, yoga – which literally means &quot;union&quot; – to this tradition has meant the &quot;realisation of our true inherent nature which is inherently greater than our thoughts can ever conceive&quot;, and that the goal of yoga is to be the &quot;free, eternal, blissful, perfect, infinite spiritually conscious&quot; one is.

Many Yoga-emphasizing Shaiva traditions emerged in medieval India, who refined yoga methods in ways such as introducing Hatha Yoga techniques. One such movement had been the &quot;Nath&quot; Yogis, a Shaivism sub-tradition that integrated philosophy from Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism traditions. It was founded by Matsyendranath and further developed by Gorakshanath. The texts of these Yoga emphasizing Hindu traditions present their ideas in Shaiva context.

===Hindu performance arts===
Shiva is the lord of dance and dramatic arts in Hinduism. This is celebrated in Shaiva temples as Nataraja, which typically shows Shiva dancing in one of the poses in the ancient Hindu text on performance arts called the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;.

Dancing Shiva as a metaphor for celebrating life and arts is very common in ancient and medieval Hindu temples. For example, it is found in Badami cave temples, Ellora Caves, Khajuraho, Chidambaram and others. The Shaiva link to the performance arts is celebrated in Indian classical dances such as Bharatanatyam and Chhau.

===Buddhism===
Buddhism and Shaivism have interacted and influenced each other since ancient times in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. Their Siddhas and esoteric traditions, in particular, have overlapped to an extent where Buddhists and Hindus worshipped in the same temple such as in the Seto Machindranath. In southeast Asia, the two traditions were not presented in competitive or polemical terms, rather as two alternate paths that lead to the same goals of liberation, with theologians disagreeing which of these is faster and simpler. Scholars disagree whether a syncretic tradition emerged from Buddhism and Shaivism, or it was a coalition with free borrowing of ideas, but they agree that the two traditions co-existed peacefully.

The earliest evidence of a close relationship between Shaivism and Buddhism comes from the archaeological sites and damaged sculptures from the northwest Indian subcontinent, such as Gandhara. These are dated to about the 1st-century CE, with Shiva depicted in Buddhist arts. The Buddhist Avalokiteshvara is linked to Shiva in many of these arts, but in others Shiva is linked to Bodhisattva Maitreya with him shown as carrying his own water pot like Vedic priests. According to Richard Blurton, the ancient works show that the Bodhisattva of Compassion in Buddhism has many features in common with Shiva in Shaivism. The Shaiva Hindu and Buddhist syncretism continues in the contemporary era in the island of Bali, Indonesia. In Central Asian Buddhism, and its historic arts, syncretism and a shared expression of Shaivism, Buddhism and Tantra themes has been common. This is evdient in the Kizil Caves in Xinjiang, where there are numerous caves that depict Shiva in the buddhist shrines through wall paintings

The syncretism between Buddhism and Shaivism was particularly marked in southeast Asia, but this was not unique, rather it was a common phenomenon also observed in the eastern regions of the Indian subcontinent, the south and the Himalayan regions. This tradition continues in predominantly Hindu Bali Indonesia in the modern era, where Buddha is considered the younger brother of Shiva. In the pre-Islamic Java, Shaivism and Buddhism were considered very close and allied religions, though not identical religions. This idea is also found in the sculptures and temples in the eastern states of India and the Himalayan region. For example, Hindu temples in these regions show Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu) flanked by a standing Buddha on its right and a standing Surya (Hindu Sun god) on left.

On major festivals of Bali Hindus, such as the Nyepi – a &quot;festival of silence&quot;, the observations are officiated by both Buddhist and Shaiva priests.

===Jainism===
Jainism co-existed with Shaiva culture since ancient times, particularly in western and southern India where it received royal support from Hindu kings of the Chaulukya, Ganga and Rashtrakuta dynasties. In late 1st millennium CE, Jainism too developed a Shaiva-like tantric ritual culture with Mantra-goddesses. These Jain rituals were aimed at mundane benefits using &quot;japas&quot; (mantra recitation) and making offerings into Homa fire.

According to Alexis Sanderson, the link and development of Shaiva goddesses into Jaina goddess is more transparent than a similar connection between Shaivism and Buddhism. The 11th-century Jain text &quot;Bhairavapadmavatikalpa&quot;, for example, equates Padmavati of Jainism with Tripura-bhairavi of Shaivism and Shaktism. Among the major goddesses of Jainism that are rooted in Hindu pantheon, particularly Shaiva, include Lakshmi and Vagishvari (Sarasvati) of the higher world in Jain cosmology, Vidyadevis of the middle world, and Yakshis such as Ambika, Cakreshvari, Padmavati and Jvalamalini of the lower world according to Jainism.

Shaiva-Shakti iconography is found in major Jain temples. For example, the Osian temple of Jainism near Jodhpur features Chamunda, Durga, Sitala, and a naked Bhairava. While Shaiva and Jain practices had considerable overlap, the interaction between the Jain community and Shaiva community differed on the acceptance of ritual animal sacrifices before goddesses. Jain remained strictly vegetarian and avoided animal sacrifice, while Shaiva accepted the practice.

==Temples and pilgrimage==

Shaiva Puranas, Agamas and other regional literature refer to temples by various terms such as &quot;Mandir&quot;, &quot;Shivayatana&quot;, &quot;Shivalaya&quot;, &quot;Shambhunatha&quot;, &quot;Jyotirlingam&quot;, &quot;Shristhala&quot;, &quot;Chattraka&quot;, &quot;Bhavaggana&quot;, &quot;Bhuvaneshvara&quot;, &quot;Goputika&quot;, &quot;Harayatana&quot;, &quot;Kailasha&quot;, &quot;Mahadevagriha&quot;, &quot;Saudhala&quot; and others. In Southeast Asia Shaiva temples are called Candi (Java), Pura (Bali), and Wat (Cambodia and nearby regions).

Many of the Shiva-related pilgrimage sites such as Varanasi, Amarnath, Kedarnath, Somnath, and others are broadly considered holy in Hinduism. They are called &quot;kṣétra&quot; (Sanskrit: क्षेत्र). A &quot;kṣétra&quot; has many temples, including one or more major ones. These temples and its location attracts pilgrimage called tirtha (or tirthayatra).

Many of the historic Puranas literature embed tourism guide to Shaivism-related pilgrimage centers and temples. For example, the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; deals primarily with &quot;Tirtha Mahatmyas&quot; (pilgrimage travel guides) to numerous geographical points, but also includes a chapter stating that a temple and &quot;tirtha&quot; is ultimately a state of mind and virtuous everyday life.

Major rivers of the Indian subcontinent and their confluence (&quot;sangam&quot;), natural springs, origin of Ganges River (and &quot;pancha-ganga&quot;), along with high mountains such as Kailasha with Mansovar Lake are particularly revered spots in Shaivism. Twelve &quot;jyotirlinga&quot; sites across India have been particularly important pilgrimage sites in Shaivism representing the radiant light (&quot;jyoti&quot;) of infiniteness, as per Śiva Mahāpurāṇa. They are Somnatha, Mallikarjuna, Mahakaleshwar, Omkareshwar, Kedarnatha, Bhimashankar, Visheshvara, Trayambakesvara, Vaidyanatha, Nageshvara, Rameshvara and Grishneshwar. Other texts mention five Kedras (Kedarnatha, Tunganatha, Rudranatha, Madhyamesvara and Kalpeshvara), five Badri (Badrinatha, Pandukeshvara, Sujnanien, Anni matha and Urghava), snow lingam of Amarnatha, flame of Jwalamukhi, all of the Narmada River, and others. Kashi (Varanasi) is declared as particularly special in numerous Shaiva texts and Upanishads, as well as in the pan-Hindu Sannyasa Upanishads such as the &quot;Jabala Upanishad&quot;.

The early Bhakti movement poets of Shaivism composed poems about pilgrimage and temples, using these sites as metaphors for internal spiritual journey.

<text>Joseph Story (September18, 1779September10, 1845) was an American lawyer, jurist, and politician who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1812 to 1845. He is most remembered for his opinions in &quot;Martin v. Hunter&#x27;s Lessee&quot; and &quot;United States v. The Amistad&quot;, and especially for his &quot;Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States&quot;, first published in 1833. Dominating the field in the 19th century, this work is a cornerstone of early American jurisprudence. It is the second comprehensive treatise on the provisions of the U.S. Constitution and remains a critical source of historical information about the forming of the American republic and the early struggles to define its law.

Story opposed Jacksonian democracy, saying it was &quot;oppression&quot; of property rights by republican governments when popular majorities began in the 1830s to restrict and erode the property rights of the minority of rich men. R. Kent Newmyer presents Story as a &quot;Statesman of the Old Republic&quot; who tried to be above democratic politics and to shape the law in accordance with the republicanism of Alexander Hamilton and John Marshall, and the New England Whigs of the 1820s and 1830s, including Daniel Webster. Historians generally agree that Story reshaped American law—as much or more than Marshall or anyone else—in a conservative direction that protected property rights.

He was portrayed by retired justice Harry Blackmun in the film &quot;Amistad&quot;, reading the case the film was based on, &quot;United States v. The Amistad&quot;.

==Early life==
Story was born in Marblehead, Massachusetts. His father was Dr. Elisha Story, a member of the Sons of Liberty who took part in the Boston Tea Party in 1773. Dr. Story moved from Boston to Marblehead during the American Revolutionary War. His first wife, Ruth (née Ruddock) died and Story remarried in November 1778, to Mehitable Pedrick, nineteen, the daughter of a wealthy shipping merchant who lost his fortune during the war. Joseph was the first-born of eleven children of the second marriage. (Story also fathered seven children from his first marriage.)

As a boy, Joseph studied at the Marblehead Academy until the fall of 1794, where he was taught by schoolmaster William Harris, later president of Columbia University. At Marblehead he chastised a fellow schoolmate and Harris responded by beating him in front of the school; his father withdrew him immediately afterward. Story was accepted at Harvard University in January 1795; he joined Adelphi, a student-run literary review, and was admitted to Phi Beta Kappa society.
After his college graduation, Story read law under Samuel Sewall and Samuel Putnam and was admitted to the bar in July 1801. Story practiced in Salem. A Democratic-Republican, Story served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1805 to 1807. From 1807 to 1809 he was the state attorney for Essex County, Massachusetts. In 1808, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, filling the vacancy caused by the death of Jacob Crowninshield. He served a partial term, May 23, 1808, to March 3, 1809. He was not a candidate for a full term, and resumed practicing law. In 1811, Story returned to the state House of Representatives, and was selected to serve as Speaker of the House.

Story&#x27;s wife, Mary Lynde Fitch Oliver, died in June 1805, shortly after their marriage and two months after the death of his father. In August 1808, he married Sarah Waldo Wetmore, the daughter of Judge William Wetmore of Boston. They had seven children but only two, Mary and William Wetmore Story, would survive to adulthood. Their son became a noted poet and sculptor—his bust of his father was mounted in the Harvard Law School Library—who would later publish &quot;The Life and Letters of Joseph Story&quot; (2 vols., Boston and London, 1851). William Wetmore Story&#x27;s biography, William Wetmore Story and His Friends, would be written by Henry James.

Longtime Washington journalist Benjamin Perley Poore wrote that, though the entire Supreme Court of that day was known for its joviality, its leading exemplar of good humor was Story, &quot;who used to assert that every man should laugh at least an hour during each day, and who had himself a great fund of humorous anecdotes.&quot;

Story was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1810, and a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814. He would later serve as that society&#x27;s vice-president from 1831 to 1845. In 1844, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Supreme Court==

On November 15, 1811, Story was nominated by President James Madison to become an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, succeeding William Cushing, who had died 14 months earlier. Aged at the time of his nomination, he became (and, , remains) the youngest person nominated to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Madison had previously nominated John Quincy Adams to succeed Cushing; Adams was confirmed by the United States Senate, but had declined to serve. On November 18, 1811, Story was confirmed by the Senate, and he was sworn into office on February 3, 1812.

Story&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Martin v. Hunter&#x27;s Lessee&quot; (1816) was profoundly significant before Story ever so much as addressed the issue explicitly. The manner in which Story framed the American republic is profoundly indicative of his philosophy. Story noted, &quot;The Constitution of the United States was ordained and established not by the States in their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, by &#x27;the people of the United States.&#x27;&quot;

Regarding the nominal issue of the case, whether the Supreme Court possessed appellate jurisdiction over the states, Story argued that the Court must possess such jurisdiction. Without national oversight over local courts the law could become discordant. This fear of discordant law was part of Story&#x27;s belief in legal science, in this instance manifested as a belief in the uniformity of law. Without uniformity, each state would be allowed to develop its own idiosyncrasies, and such provincialism ran contrary to Story&#x27;s aim of a national republic. Story cited the Constitution&#x27;s assertion to be &quot;The supreme law of the land&quot; and that &quot;Judges in every state shall be bound thereby&quot;.

The case came to symbolize a profound transformation in Story&#x27;s tenure on the Court. Initially Marshall&#x27;s most influential ally, Story enjoyed the success that came along with the nearly uniform agreement by the justices in Marshall&#x27;s Court. Following the death of the chief justice and the arrival of the Age of Jackson, Story, for the first time on the bench, seemed out of step with the rest of the Court. The Court ruled 4–2 in favor of the Warren Bridge, rejecting the petitioners&#x27; claim that their charter granted them exclusive rights. Story, writing for the minority, noted &quot;I stand upon the old law.&quot;

One of Story&#x27;s more vexing opinions was &quot;Prigg v. Pennsylvania&quot;, in which he wrote for the majority in 1842. Story was forced to consider the constitutionality of a Pennsylvania personal liberty law which placed procedural requirements on those seeking to extradite fugitive slaves. Story, despite his hatred of slavery, sided with the southern justices to declare the Pennsylvania law unconstitutional. This appears especially hard to square with Story&#x27;s anti-slavery philosophy, as one of the individuals kidnapped by Edward Prigg, the slave catcher in question, was actually not a slave at all. However, despite the outcome appearing entirely in favor of the South, a more accurate assessment can be gleaned from the text and time period. Concerning the former, Story argued that fugitive slaves were addressed in the U.S. Constitution, Art. 4, § 2. Despite the fact that slavery was not mentioned, Story concluded that it was all too clear that the clause was meant to secure runaway slaves for southern slaveholders. He went on to note, &quot;The full recognition of the right and title was indispensable to the security of this species of property in all the slaveholding States; and, indeed, was so vital to the preservation of their domestic interests and institutions, that it cannot be doubted that it constituted a fundamental article, without the adoption of which the Union could not have been formed.&quot; Story&#x27;s apparent endorsement of slaveholders&#x27; rights must be read through this light: that the justice felt that this was a bargain integral to the Constitution. Consequently, Story had an obligation to honor the deal struck at the Constitutional Convention. Further insight is provided by the political activity of southerners of the day. H. Robert Baker notes, &quot;Story chose the path that he believed best supported a strong Union and rejected the natural right of slaveholders to the people they claimed as property. His resonating opinion answered southern constitutional claims in ways that protected slaveholders&#x27; rights, but not on the terms they wanted.&quot;

Though still embroiled in his struggle with Roger Taney, Story achieved his last great victory in &quot;Swift v. Tyson&quot;. This 1842 case concerned a bill of exchange, essentially a promise of payment, given from a businessman in New York, in exchange for land in Maine. However, the individuals who received the bill of exchange, Jarius Keith and Nathaniel Norton, did not own the land in question. The central issue of the case focused on Article 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 which established that the Court was to employ state statutes as authoritative rules when they were applicable for the Court&#x27;s cases. Story, ever the nationalist, had long despised using state statutes as authoritative when he deemed federal common law a much more preferable alternative. Simply put, Story longed to place more power in the hands of judges, in particular federal judges, instead of local legislatures. Though Story, writing for the unanimous majority, rejected the fraudulent Bill of Exchange, this remains less significant than his development of federal common law. As aforementioned, section 34 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789 held that courts were bound to local state statutes. Story, though had long desired to establish federal common law, had been unable to sway sufficient support to the cause. In &quot;Swift&quot; he finally rallied sufficient support to chip away at the barrier. He noted that &quot;[Section 34 of the Judiciary Act], upon its true intendment and construction, is strictly limited to local statutes and local usages of the character before stated, and does not extend to contracts and other instruments of a commercial nature...&quot; &quot;Swift&#x27;s&quot; ultimate overruling in &quot;Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins&quot; marked a turning point in American civil procedure.

In 1829, he moved from Salem to Cambridge and became the first Dane Professor of Law at Harvard University, meeting with remarkable success as a teacher and winning the affection of his students, who had the benefit of learning from a sitting Supreme Court justice. He was a prolific writer, publishing many reviews and magazine articles, delivering orations on public occasions, and publishing books on legal subjects which won high praise on both sides of the Atlantic. Among Story&#x27;s works of this period, one of the most important is the Justice&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Constitution&quot;. The commentaries are divided into three sections, the first two concerning the colonial origins of the confederation and revolution, and the final section concerns the origins of the Constitution. Story&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot; encapsulate and expound his ideology. Within his &quot;Commentaries&quot;, Story, in particular, attacks notions of state sovereignty. Even at this moment when his time on the Court was drawing towards a close, Story remained concerned with the welfare of the Union. His guide to the Constitution stressed the sovereignty of the people rather than the states, and extensively attacked those elements, &quot;i.e.&quot;, southern sovereignty advocates, that Story felt could destabilize the Union. Story&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot; summarize much of the Justice&#x27;s philosophy and demonstrate how Story sought to use his work off the bench to continue to foster popular sovereignty over state sovereignty.

Many legal scholars attribute the development of &quot;remittitur&quot; in American law – a procedural device by which the trial judge can reduce a jury&#x27;s damages award in a civil suit on the grounds that it is excessive – to Story&#x27;s decision in the 1822 case &quot;Blunt v. Little&quot; (in which Story was sitting on the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts). While &quot;remittitur&quot; was already known from English law, Story was the first to allow the procedure to be used on the initiative of the defendant and on the grounds of excessive damages – in prior use, it had only been used by plaintiffs to correct legal errors in a jury award (awarding more damages than was legally permitted) which might have resulted in the award being overturned on appeal. Story&#x27;s innovation was enormously influential in American law and has been accepted throughout the federal and state courts.

==Significance==

Justice Story remains one of the most significant figures in early American constitutional history. Of the many justices of the Marshall Court, only the chief justice himself wrote more opinions than Story. In the 33 years that Story sat on the Court, he would transition from being an ally of Marshall to the last of an old race. Justice Story, throughout his time on the Marshall and Taney courts, championed the notion of legal science. He believed that the Union could be made stronger through the proper application of law, in particular that proper application necessitated uniformity of application. Consequently, federal control and judicial oversight were important tools to craft a more centralized Union. Story was in many respects a creature of New England; however, his chief aim was the creation of a strong Union. Consequently, several of his opinions, such as &quot;Prigg&quot;, emerge as efforts to protect the Union at the expense of black lives and freedom. Justice Story&#x27;s jurisprudence stressed the importance of nationalism through economic centralization and judicial review. While aspects of his jurisprudence would fall into the minority with the rise of Jackson, he continued to guide the Constitutional dialogue through cases like &quot;Prigg&quot; and &quot;Swift&quot;.

==Works==
Justice Story was one of the most successful American authors of the first half of the 19th century. &quot;By the time he turned 65, on September 18, 1844, he earned $10,000 a year from his book royalties. At this point, his salary as Associate Justice was $4,500.&quot;

Among his publications are:
*Commentaries on the Law of Bailments (1832)--Link to an 1846 printing.
*&quot;Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States&quot;: Volume I, &quot;Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States&quot;: Volume II and &quot;Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States&quot;: Volume III (3 vols., 1833), a work of profound learning which is still the standard treatise on the subject. Story published a One Volume Abridgment the same year.
* The Constitutional Class Book: Being a Brief Exposition of the Constitution of the United States (1834)--Story published an expanded edition, entitled &quot;A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution of the United States&quot;, in 1840.
*Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws (1834), by many regarded as his most significant work. The second edition in 1841 was revised, corrected and greatly enlarged.
*&quot;Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence&quot; (2 vols., 1835–1836)--Vol. 1 1846 printing; Vol. 2 1866 printing-revised by Isaac F. Redfield.
*Equity Pleadings (1838)
*Law of Agency (1839)--Link to an 1851 printing.
*Law of Partnership (1841)--Link to the second edition published in 1846.
*Law of Bills of Exchange (1843)--Link to second edition published in 1847.
*Law of Promissory Notes (1845)--Link to the 1851 printing.
*A Familiar Exposition of the Constitution of the United States (1847).

He also edited several standard legal works. His Miscellaneous Writings, first published in 1835, appeared in an enlarged edition in 1851.

The &quot;Life and Letters of Joseph Story&quot; (1851), edited by his son William Wetmore Story, was published in two volumes: Volume I and Volume II.

Story contributed articles (in full, and or as part of larger articles) to &quot;The Encyclopedia Americana&quot;, including Death, Punishment of.
William Wetmore Story, in &quot;The Life and Letters of Joseph Story&quot;, Volume 2, listed the articles Joseph Story wrote for &quot;The Encyclopedia Americana&quot;: &quot;Common Law,&quot; &quot;Congress of the United States,&quot; &quot;Conquest,&quot; &quot;Contracts,&quot; &quot;Corpus Delicti,&quot; &quot;Courts of England and the United States,&quot; &quot;Criminal Law&quot; (Story&#x27;s contribution begins at &quot;To the preceding article. ... &quot;), &quot;Death, Punishment of,&quot; &quot;Domicil,&quot; &quot;Equity,&quot; &quot;Evidence,&quot; &quot;Jury,&quot; &quot;Lien,&quot; &quot;Law, Legislation, and Codes&quot; (Story&#x27;s contribution begins on p. 581), &quot;Natural Law,&quot; &quot;Nations, Law of,&quot; &quot;Prize,&quot; and &quot;Usury.&quot; Story is sometimes identified as an &quot;eminent American jurist&quot; by the editors when he is a joint author of an article. See the &quot;Law, Legislation, and Codes&quot; article for an example.

==Death and legacy==

Justice Story spoke at the dedication ceremony for Mount Auburn Cemetery in 1831, which set the model for dozens of subsequent addresses over the next few decades. It also helped spark the &quot;rural cemetery&quot; movement and to link that movement to the development of the republic. Story emphasized the ways that rural cemeteries contributed to an ordered and well-regulated republic of law.

Upon his death in 1845, he was buried there &quot;as are scores of America&#x27;s celebrated political, literary, religious, and military leaders. His grave is marked by a piece of sepulchral statuary executed by his son, William Wetmore Story.&quot;

He is the namesake for Story County, Iowa.

<doc id="273830" wikidata="Q2001535" url="?curid=273830" title="Workers' Commissions">
<text>The Workers&#x27; Commissions () since the 1970s has become the largest trade union in Spain. It has more than one million members, and is the most successful union in labor elections, competing with the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT), which is historically affiliated with the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), and with the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación General del Trabajo (CGT), which is usually a distant third.

The CCOO were organized in the 1960s by the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and workers&#x27; Roman Catholic groups to fight against Francoist Spain, and for labor rights (in opposition to the non-representative &quot;vertical unions&quot; in the Spanish Labour Organization). The various organizations formed a single entity after a 1976 Congress in Barcelona.

Along with other unions like the Unión Sindical Obrera (USO) and the UGT, it called a general strike in 1976, and carried out protests against the conditions in the country. Marcelino Camacho, a major figure of Spanish trade unionism and a PCE member, was CCOO&#x27;s General Secretary from its foundation to 1985 - he was elected to the Congress of Deputies in the 1977 election. However, CCOO disassociated from the PCE in the early 1990s and is nowadays a non-partisan, negotiation-prone union.

==History==

===Birth and role in Francoist Spain===
Taking as reference the clandestine union Oposición Sindical Obrera (OSO) the first workers&#x27; commissions were organized during 1960 in Asturies, Catalonia, Madrid and the Basque provinces of Gipuzkoa and Bizkaia as labor disputes emerged outside the Francoist national-syndical movement. Originally the &quot;commissions&quot; were representative bodies of workers elected in assemblies. The first &quot;comisiones&quot; were boosted by the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), Christian labor movements (JOC and ) and other groups opposed to the Spanish State. Gradually the &quot;ad hoc&quot; commissions started to become permanent, creating a stable and well organized movement.

For many historians, one of the first places where the Workers&#x27; Commissions were formed was the valley of Laciana (province of León), within the Minero Siderurgica de Ponferrada (MSP) industry. Another place that sometimes is also cited as the first is &quot;La Camocha&quot; mine (Gijón) in 1957, during a strike. The Asturian miners&#x27; strike of 1962 (&quot;La Huelgona&quot;) was the first massive action of the union and one of the first massive popular mobilizations against Francoist Spain.

The union was heavily repressed in Spain. In 1972 all the leadership of CCOO was jailed, being judged in the infamous Proceso 1001. They remained imprisoned until the trial, more than a year later. This finally took place on 20 (day that coincided with the assassination of Prime Minister Luis Carrero Blanco, which led to the suspension of the trial for a few hours), 21 and 22 December 1973. The defendants faced the accusation of belonging to an illegal and subversive organization, and of having links with the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). On December 30 convictions were announced, which coincided with requests of the prosecutor and whose severity was considered related to the murder of Carrero Blanco. The convictions were the following: Marcelino Camacho, 20 years of jail; Nicolás Sartorius, 19; Miguel Ángel Zamora Antón, 12; Pedro Santiesteban, 12; Eduardo Saborido, 20; Francisco García Salve, 19; Luis Fernández, 12; Francisco Acosta, 12; Juan Muñiz Zapico Juanín, 18; and Fernando Soto Martín, 17. They were amnestied on 25 November 1975.

The tactic of CCOO was entryism, i.e.: infiltration in the Vertical Unions of Francoism. This tactic culminated in the union elections of 1975, where CCOO got the overwhelming majority of the delegates elected in the major companies in the country. CCOO led numerous strikes and labor mobilizations in late Francoism and the Spanish Transition.

===Transition and 1980&#x27;s===
Since the democratic transition until 1987 its secretary general was the historic union leader Marcelino Camacho, also a prominent leader of the PCE and deputy between 1977 and 1981. In 1976 CCOO held the Assembly of Barcelona, where the modern class trade union confederation was formed. CCOO was legalized on 27 April 1977. The murder of 5 labor lawyers in 1977 (members of the union and the PCE) in Madrid that year was followed by a massive funeral, more than 250,000 people participated, and the strikes that followed helped the legalization of the organization. In those years the union is growing rapidly in membership, like the rest of unions and leftist parties. From 1976 to 1978, CCOO went from 30,000 to 1,823,907 members. However, after the signing of the Moncloa Pacts, this figure gradually begun to descend, passing to 702,367 in 1981 and 332,019 in 1986. This negative trend in membership started to change since 1987. In those years CCOO also suffered various splits. In 1976 the Confederación de Sindicatos Unitarios de Trabajadores (CSUT), a group of CCOO members affiliated with the Party of Labour of Spain (PTE) split from the organization. In May 1977 CCOO suffered another split, this time from supporters of the maoist Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Organisation (ORT), that formed the Sindicato Unitario.

The year after legalization in 1978, CCOO held its I Confederal Congress, where Marcelino Camacho was reelected, what would happen again in the Second (1981) and III (1984) congresses. CCOO also was the most voted union (37.8% of the representatives) in the workers representative elections of 1978, the first democratic ones in the history of Spain. In this last congress, different factions emerged, including a majority linked to PCE (led by Marcelino Camacho) and three minorities, respectively linked to the Workers&#x27; Party of Spain – Communist Unity (PTE-UC) (called &quot;carrillistas&quot; and led by Julián Ariza); the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain (PCPE); and the Revolutionary Communist League and the Communist Movement (known as &quot;Izquierda Sindical&quot;). In 1980, CCOO received an important part of the USO members, that belonged to the socialist self-management current. In 1986 the union participated in the historical mobilizations against the permanence of Spain in NATO. CCOO asked for a &quot;NO&quot; vote in the NATO referendum.

CCOO called 4 general strikes in the government of Felipe González: 1985, 1988, 1992 and 1994; against the economic and employment policy of the PSOE government. Especially massive and historic was the 1988 Spanish general strike, organized jointly with the UGT, which had a 95% of following, and forced the government to totally withdraw the Youth Employment Plan.

===90s to today===
Since the Fourth Congress (1987), the union&#x27;s general secretary was Antonio Gutiérrez, reelected in the V Congress (1991). During his mandate CCOO distanced itself from the PCE and a preference for negotiations and the social pacts over strikes and conflictivity was promoted. This was criticized by a faction known as the Critical Sector of CCOO, supported by Marcelino Camacho and Agustin Moreno, in the sixth Congress (1996). The Critical Sector of CCOO has continued to organize the most pro-PCE sector of CCOO since then.

In the VII Congress (2000) José Maria Fidalgo was chosen as the new secretary general, being re-elected at the Eighth Congress in April 2004. In 2002 CCOO and UGT called for a general strike against a decree of the government of José María Aznar that made firings cheaper, eliminated agricultural subsidies and encouraged job insecurity, known as the &quot;decretazo&quot;. After protests the measure was withdrawn almost entirely. In this cycle CCOO reached again over one million members. CCOO also opposed the Iraq War and participated in the massive protests against it.

CCOO held its IX Confederal Congress in December 2008, with 1.2 million members and 120,000 elected delegates in the workplaces of Spain at the time. At the Ninth Congress Ignacio Fernández Toxo was elected general secretary, surpassing by 28 votes José María Fidalgo.

== General Secretary ==
Between 1987 and 2000, the union&#x27;s general secretary was Antonio Gutiérrez; he was followed by José María Fidalgo (1997–2009), often criticized by the left wing of the union. The CCOO and the UGT, summoned three general strikes (1988, 1992 and 1994) against the economic policy of the Felipe González government, and one on June 20, 2002, against the government of José María Aznar and its plan to change the unemployment insurance system.

The current General Secretary is Ignacio Fernández Toxo. On September 29, 2010, the CCOO called a general strike to protest the José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero government&#x27;s plans to raise the retirement age and cut spending.

==Organization==
CCOO is organized territorially in local, provincial, regional/nationality levels (in regional unions or in nationality confederations) and in a Spain-wide level. Equally and in a parallel way CCOO is organized at the sectoral level, from local unions in a company to the federal branch. The decision-making bodies at the federal level are the Confederal Congress, the Confederal Council and the Confederal Executive Committee. 

===Current affiliates===
Branch federations are:

In the last Congress it was divided among supporters of José María Fidalgo, prone to continuity, and Ignacio Fernández Toxo, supporters of understanding with the opposition currents.
* Critical sector of CCOO: current formed in 1996 by the left wing of CCOO and linked to the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). It was led by Agustín Moreno and supported by Marcelino Camacho. Currently its main spokesperson is Salce Elvira. It has a majority in the Federation of Pensioners and Retirees, and in the territorial federations of Asturies, the Balearic Islands and La Rioja.
* Confederal Alternative: a split of the Confederal Majority, headed by former secretary of organization Rodolfo Benito. They have clear majority in the Federations of Construction and Wood, Agrifood, and in the regional unions of Madrid, Aragón, the Canary Islands and Melilla. They are known in the union as the &quot;rodolfos&quot; or &quot;benitos&quot;.

<doc id="273831" wikidata="Q835216" url="?curid=273831" title="Weber–Fechner law">
<text>The Weber–Fechner laws are two related scientific laws in the field of psychophysics, known as Weber&#x27;s law and Fechner&#x27;s law. Both relate to human perception, more specifically the relation between the actual change in a physical stimulus and the perceived change. This includes stimuli to all senses: vision, hearing, taste, touch, and smell.

Ernst Heinrich Weber states that &quot;the minimum increase of stimulus which will produce a perceptible increase of sensation is proportional to the pre-existent stimulus,&quot; while Gustav Fechner&#x27;s law is an inference from Weber&#x27;s law (with additional assumptions) which states that the intensity of our sensation increases as the logarithm of an increase in energy rather than as rapidly as the increase.

== History and formulation of the laws ==

Both Weber&#x27;s law and Fechner&#x27;s law were formulated by Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801–1887). They were first published in 1860 in the work &quot;Elemente der Psychophysik&quot; (&quot;Elements of Psychophysics&quot;). This publication was the first work ever in this field, and where Fechner coined the term psychophysics to describe the interdisciplinary study of how humans perceive physical magnitudes. He made the claim that &quot;...psycho-physics is an exact doctrine of the relation of function or dependence between body and soul.&quot;

=== Weber&#x27;s law ===

Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795–1878) was one of the first persons to approach the study of the human response to a physical stimulus in a quantitative fashion. Fechner was a student of Weber and named his first law in honor of his mentor, since it was Weber who had conducted the experiments needed to formulate the law.

Fechner formulated several versions of the law, all communicating the same idea. One formulation states:
What this means is that the perceived change in stimuli is inversely proportional to the initial stimuli.

Weber&#x27;s law also incorporates the just-noticeable difference (JND). This is the smallest change in stimuli that can be perceived. As stated above, the JND is proportional to the initial stimuli intensity . Mathematically, it can be described as formula_1
where formula_2 is the reference stimulus and formula_3 is a constant. When plotted, this relation is a straight line with zero intercept. It may be written as , with being the sensation, formula_4 being a constant, and formula_2 being the physical intensity of the stimulus.

Weber&#x27;s law always fails at low intensities, near and below the absolute detection threshold, and often also at high intensities, but may be approximately true across a wide middle range of intensities.

==== Weber contrast ====

Although Weber&#x27;s law includes a statement of the proportionality of a perceived change to initial stimuli, Weber only refers to this as a rule of thumb regarding human perception. It was Fechner who formulated this statement as a mathematical expression referred to as Weber contrast.

formula_6
Weber contrast is not part of Weber&#x27;s law.

=== Fechner&#x27;s law ===

Fechner noticed in his own studies that different individuals have different sensitivity to certain stimuli. For example, the ability to perceive differences in light intensity could be related to how good that individual&#x27;s vision is. He also noted that how the human sensitivity to stimuli changes depends on which sense is affected. He used this to formulate another version of Weber&#x27;s law that he named &quot;die Maßformel&quot;, the &quot;measurement formula&quot;. Fechner&#x27;s law states that the subjective sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity. According to this law, human perceptions of sight and sound work as follows: Perceived loudness/brightness is proportional to logarithm of the actual intensity measured with an accurate nonhuman instrument.

formula_7

The relationship between stimulus and perception is logarithmic. This logarithmic relationship means that if a stimulus varies as a geometric progression (i.e., multiplied by a fixed factor), the corresponding perception is altered in an arithmetic progression (i.e., in additive constant amounts). For example, if a stimulus is tripled in strength (i.e., ), the corresponding perception may be two times as strong as its original value (i.e., ). If the stimulus is again tripled in strength (i.e., ), the corresponding perception will be three times as strong as its original value (i.e., ). Hence, for multiplications in stimulus strength, the strength of perception only adds. The mathematical derivations of the torques on a simple beam balance produce a description that is strictly compatible with Weber&#x27;s law.

Since Weber&#x27;s law fails at low intensity, so does Fechner&#x27;s law.

An early reference to &quot;Fechner&#x27;s ... law&quot; was in 1875 by Ludimar Hermann in &quot;Elements of Human Physiology&quot;.

==== Deriving Fechner&#x27;s law ====

Fechner&#x27;s law is a mathematical derivation of Weber contrast.

formula_8

Integrating the mathematical expression for Weber contrast gives:

formula_9

where formula_10 is a constant of integration and &quot;ln&quot; is the natural logarithm.

To solve for formula_10, assume that the perceived stimulus becomes zero at some threshold stimulus formula_12. Using this as a constraint, set formula_13 and formula_14. This gives:

formula_15

Substituting formula_10 in the integrated expression for Weber&#x27;s law, the expression can be written as:

formula_17

The constant k is sense-specific and must be determined depending on the sense and type of stimulus.

== Types of perception ==

Weber and Fechner conducted research on differences in light intensity and the perceived difference in weight. Other sense modalities provide only mixed support for either Weber&#x27;s law or Fechner&#x27;s law.

=== Weight perception ===
Weber found that the just noticeable difference (JND) between two weights was approximately proportional to the weights. Thus, if the weight of 105 g can (only just) be distinguished from that of 100 g, the JND (or differential threshold) is 5 g. If the mass is doubled, the differential threshold also doubles to 10 g, so that 210 g can be distinguished from 200 g. In this example, a weight (any weight) seems to have to increase by 5% for someone to be able to reliably detect the increase, and this minimum required fractional increase (of 5/100 of the original weight) is referred to as the &quot;Weber fraction&quot; for detecting changes in weight. Other discrimination tasks, such as detecting changes in brightness, or in tone height (pure tone frequency), or in the length of a line shown on a screen, may have different Weber fractions, but they all obey Weber&#x27;s law in that observed values need to change by at least some small but constant proportion of the current value to ensure human observers will reliably be able to detect that change.

Fechner did not conduct any experiments on how perceived heaviness increased with the mass of the stimulus. Instead, he assumed that all JNDs are subjectively equal, and argued mathematically that this would produce a logarithmic relation between the stimulus intensity and the sensation. These assumptions have both been questioned. 
Following the work of S. S. Stevens, many researchers came to believe in the 1960s that the Stevens&#x27;s power law was a more general psychophysical principle than Fechner&#x27;s logarithmic law.

=== Sound ===
Weber&#x27;s law does not quite hold for loudness. It is a fair approximation for higher intensities, but not for lower amplitudes.

==== Limitation of Weber&#x27;s law in the auditory system ====
Weber&#x27;s law does not hold at perception of higher intensities. Intensity discrimination improves at higher intensities. The first demonstration of the phenomena was presented by Riesz in 1928, in Physical Review. This deviation of the Weber&#x27;s law is known as the &quot;near miss&quot; of the Weber&#x27;s law. This term was coined by McGill and Goldberg in their paper of 1968 in Perception &amp; Psychophysics. Their study consisted of intensity discrimination in pure tones. Further studies have shown that the near miss is observed in noise stimuli as well. Jesteadt et al. (1977) demonstrated that the near miss holds across all the frequencies, and that the intensity discrimination is not a function of frequency, and that the change in discrimination with level can be represented by a single function across all frequencies: formula_18.

=== Vision ===
The eye senses brightness approximately logarithmically over a moderate range and stellar magnitude is measured on a logarithmic scale.
This magnitude scale was invented by the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus in about 150 B.C. He ranked the stars he could see in terms of their brightness, with 1 representing the brightest down to 6 representing the faintest, though now the scale has been extended beyond these limits; an increase in 5 magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of 100.
Modern researchers have attempted to incorporate such perceptual effects into mathematical models of vision.

==== Limitations of Weber&#x27;s law in visual regularity perception ====
Perception of Glass patterns and mirror symmetries in the presence of noise follows Weber&#x27;s law in the middle range of regularity-to-noise ratios (&quot;S&quot;), but in both outer ranges, sensitivity to variations is disproportionally lower. As Maloney, Mitchison, &amp; Barlow (1987) showed for Glass patterns, and as van der Helm (2010) showed for mirror symmetries, perception of these visual regularities in the whole range of regularity-to-noise ratios follows the law &quot;p&quot; = &quot;g&quot;/(2+1/&quot;S&quot;) with parameter &quot;g&quot; to be estimated using experimental data.

====Limitation of Weber&#x27;s law at low light levels====

For vision, Weber&#x27;s law implies constancy of luminance contrast. Suppose a target object is set against a background luminance formula_19. In order to be just visible, the target must be brighter or fainter than the background by some small amount formula_20. The Weber contrast is defined as formula_21, and Weber&#x27;s law says that formula_10 should be constant for all formula_19.

Human vision follows Weber&#x27;s law closely at normal daylight levels (i.e. in the photopic range) but begins to break down at twilight levels (the mesopic range) and is completely inapplicable at low light levels (scotopic vision). This can be seen in data collected by Blackwell and plotted by Crumey, showing threshold increment formula_20 versus background luminance formula_19 for various targets sizes. At daylight levels, the curves are approximately straight with slope 1, i.e. formula_20 = formula_27, implying formula_21 is constant. At the very darkest background levels (formula_19 ≲ 10− 5 cd m−2, approximately 25 mag arcsec−2) the curves are flat - this is where the only visual perception is the observer&#x27;s own neural noise (&#x27;dark light&#x27;). In the intermediate range, a portion can be approximated by the De Vries - Rose law, related to Ricco&#x27;s law.

== Logarithmic coding schemes for neurons ==

===Lognormal distributions===
Activation of neurons by sensory stimuli in many parts of the brain is by a proportional law: neurons change their spike rate by about 10–30%, when a stimulus (e.g. a natural scene for vision) has been applied. However, as Scheler (2017) showed,
the population distribution of the intrinsic excitability or gain of a neuron is a heavy tail distribution, more precisely a lognormal shape, which is equivalent to a logarithmic coding scheme. Neurons may therefore spike with 5–10 fold different mean rates. Obviously, this increases the dynamic range of a neuronal population, while stimulus-derived changes remain small and linear proportional.

An analysis of the length of comments in internet discussion boards across several languages shows that comment lengths obey the lognormal distribution with great precision. The authors explain the distribution as a manifestation of the Weber–Fechner law.

== Other applications ==
The Weber–Fechner law has been applied in other fields of research than just the human senses.

=== Numerical cognition ===
Psychological studies show that it becomes increasingly difficult to discriminate between two numbers as the difference between them decreases. This is called the &quot;distance effect&quot;. This is important in areas of magnitude estimation, such as dealing with large scales and estimating distances. It may also play a role in explaining why consumers neglect to shop around to save a small percentage on a large purchase, but will shop around to save a large percentage on a small purchase which represents a much smaller absolute dollar amount.

=== Pharmacology ===

It has been hypothesized that dose-response relationships can follow Weber&#x27;s Law which suggests this law – which is often applied at the sensory level – originates from underlying chemoreceptor responses to cellular signaling dose relationships within the body. Dose response can be related to the Hill equation, which is closer to a power law.

=== Public finance ===

There is a new branch of the literature on public finance hypothesizing that the Weber–Fechner law can explain the increasing levels of public expenditures in mature democracies. Election after election, voters demand more public goods to be effectively impressed; therefore, politicians try to increase the magnitude of this &quot;signal&quot; of competence – the size and composition of public expenditures – in order to collect more votes.

=== Emotion ===
Preliminary research has found that pleasant emotions adhere to Weber’s Law, with accuracy in judging their intensity decreasing as pleasantness increases. However, this pattern wasn&#x27;t observed for unpleasant emotions, suggesting a survival-related need for accurately discerning high-intensity negative emotions.

<text>Henry Wheaton (November 27, 1785 – March 11, 1848) was an American lawyer, jurist and diplomat. He was the third reporter of decisions for the United States Supreme Court, the first U.S. minister to Denmark, and the second U.S. minister to Prussia.

==Biography==
He was born at Providence, Rhode Island. He graduated from Rhode Island College (now Brown University) in 1802, was admitted to the bar in 1805, and, after two years&#x27; study abroad in Poitiers and London, practiced law at Providence (1807-1812) and at New York City (1812-1827). From 1812 to 1815, he edited &quot;National Advocate&quot;, the organ of the administration party. There he published notable articles on the question of neutral rights in connection with the then-existing war with England. On October 26, 1814, he became division judge advocate of the army. He was a justice of the Marine Court of New York City from 1815 to 1819.

From 1816 to 1827, he edited reports of the Supreme Court, as the third Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. Aided by Justice Joseph Story, his reports were known for their comprehensive notes and summaries of the arguments presented by each side. However, the volumes were slow in appearing and costly. Wheaton&#x27;s successor Richard Peters condensed his work, and Wheaton sued him, claiming infringement of his common-law copyright. The Supreme Court rejected his claim in &quot;Wheaton v. Peters&quot; in 1834, which was the Court&#x27;s first copyright case.

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1820.
He was elected a member of the convention to form a new constitution for New York in 1821, was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co.) in 1824, and in 1825 was associated with John Duer and Benjamin F. Butler in a commission to revise the statute law of New York. He also took part in important cases, and was the sole associate of Daniel Webster in that which settled the limits of the state and federal legislation in reference to bankruptcy and insolvency. In 1825, he aided in the revision of the laws of New York.

His diplomatic career began in 1827, with an appointment to Denmark as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;. He served until 1835, displaying skill in the settlement of the sound dues that were imposed by Denmark on the vessels of all countries, and obtained modifications of the quarantine regulations. He was noted for his research into the Scandinavian language and literature, and was elected a member of Scandinavian and Icelandic societies. In 1829, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

In 1835 he was appointed minister to Prussia, being promoted to minister plenipotentiary in 1837. He soon received full power to conclude a treaty with the Zollverein, which he pursued for the next six years. On March 25, 1844, he signed a treaty with Germany, for which he received high commendation from President Tyler and John C. Calhoun, the secretary of state. This was rejected by the U.S. Senate but served as the basis for subsequent treaties. He was made a corresponding member of the French Institute in 1843, and a member of the Royal Academy of Berlin in 1846.

Other issues Wheaton dealt with during his diplomatic career were Scheldt dues, the tolls on the Elbe, and the rights of naturalized citizens.
In 1846 Wheaton was requested to resign as Prussian minister by the new president, Polk, who needed his place for another appointment. The request provoked general condemnation, but Wheaton resigned and returned to the United States.

He was called at once to Harvard Law School as lecturer on international law, but illness prevented his acceptance. He died at Dorchester, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1848.

==Philosophy==
Wheaton&#x27;s general theory is that international law consists of &quot;those rules of conduct which reason deduces, as consonant to justice, from the nature of the society existing among independent nations, with such definitions and modifications as may be established by general consent.&quot;

== Family connections ==
Wheaton&#x27;s niece, Ellen Smith Tupper, became a noted beekeeper. Ellen Tupper&#x27;s daughters included Unitarian Universalist ministers Eliza Tupper Wilkes and Mila Tupper Maynard, and educator Kate Tupper Galpin. Her grandson was artist Allen Tupper True.

<text>The native states of India, also known as feudatory or princely states, were typically vassals under a local or regional ruler who owed allegiance to the British Raj. There were about 675 native states in all but many were not parts of British India proper because they never become possessions of the British Crown; rather, they were tied to it in a system of subsidiary alliances. Following the Partition of India in 1947, the suzerainty of the Raj was terminated and native states had to choose between independence or formal accession by either India or Pakistan. In practice, all of the native states had acceded or been annexed by the end of 1949.

For postal purposes, many native states ran their own services and their stamp issues have been termed feudatory by the main catalogues such as Stanley Gibbons Ltd. There were exceptions in the form of six convention states who made separate postal arrangements with the Raj and used British India stamps that were overprinted with the state&#x27;s name.

==Stamp-issuing native states==

The native states which issued postage stamps have been categorised as either convention states or feudatory states. The words &#x27;convention&#x27; and &#x27;feudatory&#x27; in this sense referred solely to postal arrangements with or in relation to British India.

In all, there were some 675 feudatory states at various times, but not all issued postal stamps and/or stationery. Many of the first issues were printed locally, using primitive methods such as typography and so they can be very rare. There was low quality of printing and design in many cases and collectors sometimes informally refer to them as &quot;Uglies&quot;. All remaining feudatory issues were replaced by stamps of the Republic of India on 1 April 1950 and most were declared obsolete from 1 May 1950 – there was one exception in the &quot;Anchal&quot; stamps of Travancore-Cochin which remained current until 1 July 1951.

There were six convention states: Chamba, Faridkot, Gwalior, Jind, Nabha and Patiala. They all used stamps of British India which were overprinted with the name of the state in Latin or Hindi/Urdu letters, or both. The Gibbons catalogue omits minor varieties of these stamps which had printing errors such as smaller letters, broken letters, unequal inking and unequal spacing. The convention issues were replaced by those of the Republic of India on 1 April 1950 but remained current until 31 December of that year, becoming obsolete from 1 January 1951.

The native states which issued stamps were as follows. Unless otherwise stated, the currency in use was 12 pies = 1 anna; 16 annas = 1 rupee. The dates are the starting and ending dates of stamp issue validity:
