<text>The contemporary culture of North Korea is based on traditional Korean culture, but has developed since the division of Korea in 1945. Juche, officially the Juche idea, is the state ideology of North Korea. Juche displays North Korea&#x27;s cultural distinctiveness as it is the origin and sole adopter of the ideology.

Art in North Korea is primarily didactic, where cultural expression serves as an instrument for inculcating &quot;Juche&quot; ideology and the need to continue the struggle for revolution and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. Foreign governments and citizens, especially Americans, are depicted negatively as imperialists; while revolutionary heroes and heroines are seen as saintly figures who act from pure motives. The three most consistent themes are martyrdom during the revolutionary struggle (depicted in literature such as &quot;The Sea of Blood&quot;), the happiness of the present society, and the genius of the leader.

Kim Il Sung has been described as a writer of &quot;classical masterpieces&quot; during the anti-Japanese struggle. Novels created under his direction include &quot;The Flower Girl&quot;, &quot;The Sea of Blood&quot;, &quot;The Fate of a Self-Defense Corps Man&quot;, and &quot;The Song of Korea&quot;; these are considered &quot;prototypes and models of &quot;Juche&quot; literature and art.&quot; A 1992 newspaper report describes Kim in semi-retirement as writing his memoirs—&quot;a heroic epic dedicated to the freedom and happiness of the people.&quot;

Due to North Korean isolationism, the general population has little to no exposure to foreign cultural influences apart from performances by song-and-dance groups and other entertainers brought in periodically for limited audiences. These performances, such as the Spring Friendship Art Festival held annually in April, are designed to show that the peoples of the world, like the North Koreans themselves, love and respect the country&#x27;s leader. During the 1980s and the early 1990s, the North Korean media credits Kim Jong Il for making the country a &quot;kingdom of art.&quot; The North Korean media claims Kim Jong Il is supposedly responsible for cultural policy.

Pyongyang and other large cities offer the broadest selection of cultural expression. &quot;Art propaganda squads&quot; travel to production sites in the provinces to perform poetry readings, one-act plays, and songs in order to &quot;congratulate workers on their successes&quot; and &quot;inspire them to greater successes through their artistic agitation.&quot; Such squads are prominent in the countryside during the harvest season and whenever &quot;speed battles&quot; to increase productivity are held.

North Korean society and culture through the lens of theater, film, and everyday performance make up an ideology-shaping matrix that not only entertains but also organizes and mobilizes society. The culture has a tremendous influence on the daily lives of people in North Korea.

==Guidance and control==
The state and the Korean Workers&#x27; Party (KWP) control the production of literature and art. In the early 1990s, there was no evidence of any underground anti-regime literary or cultural movements such as the samizdat in the Soviet Union or those that exist in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The party exercises control over culture through its Propaganda and Agitation Department and the Culture and Arts Department of the KWP&#x27;s Central Committee. The KWP&#x27;s General Federation of Korean Literature and Arts Unions, the parent body for all literary and artistic organizations, also directs cultural activity. Due to widespread media control, some analysts have characterized North Koreans as &quot;censorees&quot;.
These media of paintings, songs, movies, and mass games tell the story of Kim Il Sung as the father of the nation and provides guidance on how to behave as &quot;model citizens&quot; of North Korea.

==Cultural expression==
The general theme of cultural expression is to take the best aspects from the past while discarding capitalistic elements. Popular vernacular styles and themes in literature, art, music, and dance are esteemed as they are seen as expressing the unique spirit of the Korean nation. Ethnographers restore and reintroduce cultural forms that have a proletarian or folk spirit and that encourages the development of a collective consciousness. Lively, optimistic musical and choreographic expressions are emphasized. Group folk dances and choral singing are traditionally practiced in some but not all parts of Korea and were being promoted throughout North Korea in the early 1990s among school and university students. Farmers&#x27; musical bands have also been revived.

==Literature, music, and film==


Literature is dominated by political themes. A series of historical novels—&quot;Pulmyouui yoksa&quot; (&quot;Immortal History&quot;)— depict the heroism and tragedy of the pre-liberation era. The Korean War is the key theme of &quot;Korea Fights&quot; and &quot;The Burning Island&quot;. Since the late 1970s, five &quot;great revolutionary plays&quot; have been promoted as models of the party&#x27;s literature: &quot;The Shrine for a Tutelary Deity&quot;, a theatrical rendition of &quot;The Flower Girl&quot;, &quot;Three Men, One Party&quot;, &quot;A Letter from a Daughter&quot;, and &quot;Hyolbun mangukhoe&quot; (&quot;Resentment at the World Conference&quot;).

Korean revolutionary opera, derived from traditional Korean operas, known as &quot;ch&#x27;angguk&quot;, are often variations on Korean folk songs. Old fairy tales have also been changed to include revolutionary themes. As part of the party&#x27;s policy of preserving the best from Korea&#x27;s past, premodern vernacular works such as the &quot;Sasong kibong&quot; (&quot;Encounter of Four Persons&quot;) and the &quot;Ssangch&#x27;on kibong&quot; (&quot;Encounter at the Two Rivers&quot;) have been reprinted with edits to suit that purpose as well.

Musical compositions include the &quot;Song of General Kim Il Sung&quot;, &quot;Long Life and Good Health to the Leader&quot;, and &quot;We Sing of His Benevolent Love&quot;—hymns that praise the nation&#x27;s leader. According to a North Korean writer, &quot;Our musicians have pursued the party&#x27;s policy of composing orchestral music based on famous songs and folk songs popular among our people and produced numerous instrumental pieces of a new type.&quot; This music includes a symphony based on the theme of &quot;The Sea of Blood&quot;, which has also been made into a revolutionary opera.

In February 2008, the New York Philharmonic Orchestra became the first U.S. orchestra to perform in North Korea, albeit for a handpicked &quot;invited audience&quot;. The concert was broadcast on national television. The Christian rock band Casting Crowns played at the annual Spring Friendship Arts Festival in April 2007, held in Pyongyang.

Motion pictures are recognized as &quot;the most powerful medium for educating the masses&quot; and play a central role in social education. According to a North Korean source, &quot;films for children contribute to the formation of the rising generation, with a view to creating a new kind of man, harmoniously evolved and equipped with well-founded knowledge and a sound mind in a sound body.&quot; One of the most influential films, &quot;An Jung-geun Shoots Ito Hirobumi&quot;, tells of the assassin who killed the Japanese resident-general in Korea in 1909. The protagonist is portrayed as a courageous patriot, but one whose efforts to liberate Korea were frustrated because the masses had not been united under &quot;an outstanding leader who enunciates a correct guiding thought and scientific strategy and tactics.&quot; Folk tales such as &quot;The Tale of Chun Hyang&quot;, about a nobleman who marries a servant girl, and &quot;The Tale of On Dal&quot; have also been made into films.

Kim Jong Il showed interest in or perhaps even obsession with cinema. The North Korean leader reportedly had a huge library of Western and Asian movies. In the 1980s, he even ordered the kidnapping of two South Korean movie-makers and forced them to make films for the North Korean state.

Australian filmmaker Anna Broinowski gained access to North Korea&#x27;s film industry through British filmmaker Nick Bonner, who facilitated meetings between Broinowski and prominent North Korean filmmakers to assist Broinowski with the production of &quot;Aim High in Creation!&quot;, a film project based on Kim Jong Il&#x27;s manifesto. Broinowski explained in July 2013, prior to the screening of the film at the Melbourne International Film Festival:
A friend gave me Kim Jong Il&#x27;s manifesto on how to make the &#x27;perfect socialist film&#x27;, The Cinema and Directing (1987). I was immediately fascinated by his often counter-intuitive (for a Westerner at least) filmmaking rules. And I began to ponder: what would a film by Westerners, strictly adhering to Kim Jong Il&#x27;s rules, be like? Could it have the same power over western audiences that North Korean films have over Kim Jong Il&#x27;s 23 million citizens? ... I wanted to humanise the North Koreans in the minds of viewers constantly bombarded by the mainstream Western media&#x27;s depiction of North Koreans as victimised, brainwashed automatons.

A version of Broinowski&#x27;s work was screened in Pyongyang, but the director believes that the documentary version of the film will not be allowed into the country.

A study commissioned by the U. S. State Department shows that, despite extremely strict regulations and draconian penalties, North Koreans, particularly elite elements, have increased access to news and other media outside the state-controlled media authorized by the government. While access to the Internet is tightly controlled, listening to the radio and viewing DVDs is increasing, and receiving television broadcasts from neighboring states is also possible in border areas.
A South Korean professor claimed that the spread of cheap, Chinese-made &quot;portable TVs&quot; (EVD players) in North Korea is making it harder for authorities to crack down on citizens watching South Korean-made videos.

==Visual arts==
Historically, graphic design in North Korea was influenced by the Soviet bloc and by Korean tradition. It has tended to use a &quot;Korean palette&quot; of bright colours. In around 2005, digital design replaced hand-drawn graphics, and the Western influence became stronger.

==Architecture and city planning==

The most distinct and impressive form of contemporary cultural expression in North Korea is architecture and city planning. Pyongyang, almost completely destroyed by the United States during the Korean War, has been rebuilt on a grand scale. Many new buildings have been constructed during the 1980s and 1990s in order to enhance Pyongyang&#x27;s status as a capital.

Major structures are divided architecturally into three categories: monuments, buildings that combine traditional Korean architectural motifs and modern construction, and high-rise buildings of a modern design. Examples of the first include the Ch&#x27;ollima Statue; a twenty-meter high bronze statue of Kim Il Sung in front of the Museum of the Korean Revolution (itself, at 240,000 square meters, one of the largest structures in the world); the Arch of Triumph (similar to its Parisian counterpart, although a full ten meters higher); and Juche Tower, 170 meters high, built on the occasion of Kim&#x27;s seventieth birthday in 1982.

The second architectural category makes special use of traditional tiled roof designs and includes the People&#x27;s Palace of Culture and the Grand People&#x27;s Study House, both in Pyongyang, and the International Friendship Exhibition Hall at Myohyang-san. The latter building displays gifts given to Kim Il Sung by foreign dignitaries. In light of North Korea&#x27;s current close relationship to China, and during the Joseon period, it is significant that the section of the hall devoted to gifts from China is the largest.

The third architectural category includes high-rise apartment complexes, including Harmonica houses, and hotels in the capital. The most striking of these buildings is the Ryugyong Hotel, unfinished as of now (with construction halted from 1992 to April 2008). Described as one of the world&#x27;s tallest hotels at 105 stories, its triangular shape looms over north-central Pyongyang. The Koryo Hotel is an ultramodern, twin-towered structure forty-five stories high.

Much construction occurred before celebrations of Kim Il Sung&#x27;s eightieth birthday, including the building of grand apartment complexes and the Reunification Highway, a four-lane road connecting the capital and the Demilitarized Zone. According to a journalist writing in the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot;, the highway is &quot;an impressive piece of engineering&quot; that &quot;cuts a straight path through mountainous terrain with 21 tunnels and 23 bridges on the 168 kilometers route to P&#x27;anmunjm.&quot; As in many other construction projects, the military provided the labor. North Korea has stated its hope that upon eventual reunification the highway will carry back-and-forth traffic.

==Mass games==
North Korea is famous for its &quot;mass games&quot;. Mass games are the culminating annual celebrations of the state leader&#x27;s birthdays and the rituals commemorating the foundation of the state: On the birthdays of Kim Il Sung (April 15, 1912), the founding father of North Korea, and Kim Jong Il (born February 16, 1942), the former leader of the state. These are exhibitions where thousands of North Koreans perform highly choreographed dances, especially traditional dances, and gymnastics, often engaging in simultaneous rhythms of movement. The performers sing and chant their loyalties to Kim Il Sung, the KWP, and to the principle of Juche.

<text>Star Alliance is an airline alliance headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. Founded on 14 May 1997, it was the world&#x27;s first global airline alliance. As of April 2024, it is also the world&#x27;s largest airline alliance by market share, holding 17.4%, compared to 13.7% for SkyTeam and 11.9% for Oneworld.

Star Alliance has 25 member airlines that operate a combined fleet of over 5,000 aircraft, serving more than 1,300 airports in 195 countries on more than 19,000 daily departures. The alliance has a two-tier rewards program, Silver and Gold, with incentives including priority boarding and upgrades. Like other airline alliances, Star Alliance airlines share airport terminals (known as co-locations), and many member planes are painted in the alliance&#x27;s livery.

== History ==
=== 1997–1999: Founding and early years ===
On 14 May 1997, an agreement forming the Star Alliance was announced with five airlines across three continents: Air Canada, Lufthansa, Scandinavian Airlines, Thai Airways International and United Airlines. The alliance chose Young &amp; Rubicam for advertising, with a budget of $25 million (€18 million). The airlines shared the star logo from the beginning, with its five points representing the founding airlines. The alliance adopted its first slogan, &quot;The Airline Network for Earth&quot;, with its goal being &quot;an alliance that will take passengers to every major city on Earth&quot;.

The now defunct Brazilian airline VARIG joined Star Alliance on 22 October 1997, extending the alliance into South America. Also joining were Ansett Australia and Air New Zealand, expanding Star Alliance to Australia and the Pacific. With the addition of the latter two carriers, the alliance served 720 destinations in 110 countries with a combined fleet of 1,650 aircraft. The next airline to join the alliance is Japan&#x27;s All Nippon Airways on 15 October 1999, making it the second Asian airline in the alliance.

=== 2000s: Expansion and first decade ===
During the early 2000s, a number of airlines joined Star Alliance; the Austrian Airlines Group (Austrian Airlines, Tyrolean Airways and Lauda Air) joined on 26 March 2000 and Singapore Airlines on 1 April. BMI (British Midland) and Mexicana joined on 1 July, bringing the alliance&#x27;s membership to 13. With Singapore Airlines&#x27; entry into the alliance, Thai Airways considered moving to OneWorld, but eventually decided to remain. The addition of BMI made London Heathrow the only European hub with two alliances. During the year, Emirates considered joining Star Alliance, but decided against it. That year the now-defunct BWIA West Indies Airways, which had entered an alliance with United Airlines, considered becoming a member but did not. In 2000, the alliance also opened its first three business centers (in Los Angeles, Frankfurt, and Bangkok) and announced the formation of an Alliance Management Team (AMT), the partnership&#x27;s executive body. In September 2001, Ansett Australia (the alliance&#x27;s only Australian member) left Star Alliance due to bankruptcy, giving most of the Australian market to Qantas (a Oneworld member). That year, Star Alliance announced the appointment of a new CEO, Jaan Albrecht.

Partner airlines promoted the Star Alliance brand with a ‘Round the World’ ticket (RWT) that offered choices of 19,000, 21,000, and 23,000 miles with stopovers of 15 cities valid for one year.

Asiana Airlines joined the alliance on 1 March 2003, Spanair on 1 May 2003, followed by LOT Polish Airlines (Poland&#x27;s flag carrier) joining in October.
Around this time, Mexicana Airlines left the alliance after deciding not to renew a codeshare agreement with United Airlines, later joining Oneworld. US Airways joined the alliance in May 2004, becoming its second US-based airline. In November Adria Airways, Blue1 and Croatia Airlines joined the alliance as its first three regional members.

Although Star Alliance invited Lineas Aereas Azteca in 2005 to join in mid-2007, the airline filed for bankruptcy. TAP Air Portugal joined on 14 March 2005, adding African destinations to the network. In April 2006, Swiss International Air Lines, the alliance&#x27;s sixth European airline, and South African Airways (its first African carrier) became the 17th and 18th members.

By May 2007, Star Alliance&#x27;s 10th anniversary, its members had a combined 16,000 daily departures to 855 destinations in 155 countries and served 406 million passengers annually. The alliance introduced Biosphere Connections, a partnership with UNESCO, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands to promote environmental sustainability.

VARIG left the alliance on 31 January 2007, and the two Chinese airlines, Air China and Shanghai Airlines, joined on 12 December.

On 1 April 2008, Turkish Airlines joined the alliance after a 15-month integration process beginning in December 2006, becoming its 20th member. EgyptAir, Egypt&#x27;s national airline and Star Alliance&#x27;s second African carrier, joined on 11 July 2008.

On 27 October 2009, Continental Airlines became the 25th member of Star Alliance after leaving SkyTeam three days earlier. According to alliance CEO Jaan Albrecht, &quot;Bringing Continental Airlines into Star Alliance has been a truly unique experience. This is the first time an airline has moved directly from one alliance to another, and I would like to thank all those involved in ensuring a smooth switch&quot;. At the time, it was rumored that the switch was Continental&#x27;s first move in a planned merger with United Airlines. Two months later, Brussels Airlines joined the alliance.

=== 2010s: Further expansion and second decade of operations ===

Brazilian carrier TAM Airlines joined Star Alliance on 13 May 2010, increasing its foothold in South America. Aegean Airlines, Greece&#x27;s largest airline by number of passengers, joined on 30 June.

Shanghai Airlines left the alliance on 31 October 2010 when it merged with China Eastern Airlines, a SkyTeam member. On 29 September, the chief executive board approved Ethiopian Airlines as Star Alliance&#x27;s 30th member, though Ethiopian did not officially join the alliance until December of the following year. In 2010 the alliance flew to 1,172 airports in 181 countries, with about 21,200 daily departures.

Since 2011, the alliance has gained several large members, but it has lost others due to collapse or mergers. On 13 December 2011, Ethiopian Airlines joined, adding five countries and 24 destinations to the alliance&#x27;s map.

2012 and 2013 were tumultuous years for Star Alliance, starting with two key departures but ending with a major move into Latin America. In Europe, Spanair ceased operations, and BMI left after being acquired by International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of Oneworld members Iberia and British Airways. BMI was integrated into British Airways. In North America, Continental merged with United Airlines, reducing Star Alliance&#x27;s membership further, even if it effectively remained in the alliance after the merger. On 21 June, though, Avianca, TACA Airlines and Copa Airlines joined, massively increasing the alliance&#x27;s Latin American presence. In November, Blue1 left after becoming an affiliate of parent Scandinavian Airlines. and Shenzhen Airlines joined, augmenting Air China&#x27;s Chinese network. Taiwanese carrier EVA Air then joined on 18 June 2013, and after TACA&#x27;s integration into Avianca, the alliance grew to 28 members, making it the largest of the three major airline alliances. On 13 December, Air India was again invited to begin an integration process with Star Alliance and joined the alliance on 11 July 2014.

Following this string of expansions, 2014 opened with two major departures through mergers. First, Brazilian carrier TAM Airlines merged with LAN Airlines to become LATAM Airlines Group, leaving the alliance without a presence in the world&#x27;s fifth-largest country. Next, US Airways completed its merger with American Airlines and also left the alliance. Both parent companies stayed with Oneworld. On 24 June, though, the alliance finally approved Air India, which joined on 11 July, leaving the alliance at 27 members.

Future expansion centers around the addition of &quot;Connecting Partners,&quot; subsidiaries or partners of alliance members which will add connectivity to the alliance without becoming full members. Avianca Brasil joined in this way on 22 July 2015, bringing the alliance back into the Brazilian market and partially filling the void left by TAM. South African Airways&#x27; low-cost subsidiary, Mango, was initially announced to join as a Connecting Partner in Q3 2016, but has since been delayed. Juneyao Airlines, which codeshares with Shenzhen Airlines, joined as a Connecting Partner on 23 May 2017. On 20 August 2019, Star Alliance announced affiliate member Avianca Brasil&#x27;s exit from the alliance from 1 September 2019. The departure, however, won&#x27;t affect Avianca&#x27;s membership. On 30 September 2019, Adria Airways ceased operations, and the airline exited the alliance on 2 October 2019.

=== 2020s: 25th anniversary and restructuring of several member airlines ===
The now-defunct regional subsidiary of Thai Airways, Thai Smile joined as a Connecting Partner in February 2020. In January 2024, the Thai Smile brand was discontinued and folded into the parent airline as a result of the reorganization of Thai Airways International following bankruptcy.

On 16 November 2020, Asiana Airlines announced their plans to exit the alliance. Asiana will merge with Korean Air, the South Korean Government confirmed, in a $1.6 billion acquisition by the SkyTeam member. After the US Department of Justice approved the merger in December 2024, the merger was completed and Asiana Airlines became a subsidiary of Korean Air. No date was given when the airline will depart Star Alliance, until Asiana will end its 38 years of operation and will be integrated to Korean Air in 2026.

In 2022, Lufthansa Group announced plans to buy a 42% stake in ITA Airways, a SkyTeam member. The European Commission approved the group&#x27;s purchase of ITA&#x27;s 41% stake in July 2024. On 3 February 2025, ITA Airways announced that it has left SkyTeam following the acquisition by Lufthansa Group. ITA will join Star Alliance during the first half of 2026.

On October 2023, as a part of the restructuring of Scandinavian Airlines&#x27; parent company SAS Group, Air France-KLM, along with the Government of Denmark and two financial firms announced plans to invest in Scandinavian Airlines. In March 2024, US Bankruptcy Court approved the investment along with Stockholm District Court in 12 June 2024 and European Commission on 28 June 2024. As a result of the investment, Scandinavian Airlines left Star Alliance on 31 August 2024 and joined SkyTeam on 1 September 2024.

=== Frequent flyer programs, Star Alliance Silver and Gold status===
Status miles can be earned across all Star Alliance member airlines’ frequent flyer programs using a single frequent flyer card, allowing members to attain Star Alliance Silver status or progress to Gold status. Membership in any Star Alliance airline program grants full access to the entire Star Alliance network without the need to register with any additional program.

The more a customer flies on the Star Alliance network, the faster miles or points can be earned, which can be used redeem for a reward ticket or upgrade, along with several other rewards in specific airlines. Customers will have to provide their frequent flyer number when booking flights or when checking in whenever they fly with any Star Alliance member airline in eligible booking classes, for miles or points to be credited to their account.

The higher-tier status levels of each member airline’s frequent flyer programs are aligned with the two uniformly recognized Star Alliance status levels: Star Alliance Silver and Star Alliance Gold. These two status levels entitle special Star Alliance premium customer benefits and privileges. Several programs have premium statuses beyond Gold, but these statuses are still considered under Gold status within the overall Star Alliance network.

Star Alliance Silver grants customers within the frequent-flyer program access to priority reservations waitlist and priority airport stand-by. Star Alliance Gold is given to customers who have reached a higher level of a member airline&#x27;s frequent-flyer program. Benefits are priority reservations waitlist, airport stand-by, check-in and baggage handling; an additional checked luggage allowance of (or one extra piece, where the piece rule applies), and access to designated Star Alliance Gold lounges the day and place of departure with the presentation of a Star Alliance boarding pass. Some airlines also offer preferred seating (an exit seat or a special section of the plane); guaranteed seating on fully booked flights, subject to the booking class code and notice period, and free upgrades in the form of a voucher, certificate or automatic upgrade at check-in. United restricts US lounge access for their Gold Members to long-haul international passengers; Gold members from other carriers are welcome in US lounges run by United on all itineraries.

It is possible to join multiple member airline frequent flyer programmes. However, as they are each managed separately, miles or points can neither be transferred between programs nor be consolidated into a single program. Therefore, using a single frequent flyer programme provides a faster path towards attaining Star Alliance Silver or Star Alliance Gold.

=== Codeshares ===

The common use of codeshare agreements led to suspicions of anti-competitive behavior. The European Union suspected the alliance of operating as a virtual merger of its members, with speculation that, if regulations were relaxed, the members might merge into one corporation.

In 2004, Star Alliance introduced a &quot;regional&quot; concept to expand its reach through smaller regional carriers. To join, these regional members needed sponsorship from an existing alliance member. The alliance no longer labels airlines as &quot;regional&quot; members, instead referring to all 27 airlines simply as &quot;members.&quot;

== Livery and logo ==
Some Star Alliance members paint some of their aircraft with the alliance livery, usually a white fuselage with &quot;Star Alliance&quot; across it and a black tail fin with the alliance logo; the color or design of the engine cowlings or winglets remains, depending on the member&#x27;s livery. Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand were two exceptions: Singapore Airlines formerly kept its logo on the tails of its aircraft, but now uses the Star Alliance logo on white tails, while Air New Zealand now uses full black livery with reversed colored original Star Alliance livery elements. Asiana Airlines was the first Star Alliance member to paint its aircraft in the current Star Alliance livery. Aircraft painted in an airline&#x27;s regular livery have the Star Alliance logo between the cockpit and the first set of cabin doors, except double deck airliner like Boeing 747 and Airbus A380, which printed Star Alliance logo behind cockpit, and airliner with narrow space between the cockpit and the cabin door like the McDonnell Douglas DC-9\MD-80 and Comac C909, which printed the Star Alliance logo under the cockpit or on the first cabin door.
== Award and recognition ==
On 24 June 2024, Star Alliance was voted for two top awards by Skytrax; &quot;2024&quot; &quot;World&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Best Airline Alliance&quot; and &quot;Best Airline Alliance Lounge&quot;.

<doc id="286392" wikidata="Q738898" url="?curid=286392" title="Chain of custody">
<text>Chain of custody (CoC), in legal contexts, is the chronological documentation or that records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of materials, including physical or electronic evidence. Of particular importance in criminal cases, the concept is also applied in civil litigation and more broadly in drug testing of athletes and in supply chain management, e.g. to improve the traceability of food products, or to provide assurances that wood products originate from sustainably managed forests. It is often a tedious process that has been required for evidence to be shown legally in court. Now, however, with new portable technology that allows accurate laboratory quality results from the scene of the crime, the chain of custody is often much shorter which means evidence can be processed for court much faster.

The term is also sometimes used in the fields of history, art history, and archives as a synonym for provenance (meaning the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object, document or group of documents), which may be an important factor in determining authenticity.

==Criminal evidence==
When evidence can be used in court to convict people of crimes, it must be handled in a scrupulously careful manner to prevent tampering or contamination. The idea behind recording the &quot;chain of custody&quot; is to establish that the alleged evidence is in fact related to the alleged crime, rather than having, for example, been &quot;planted&quot; fraudulently to make someone appear guilty.

Establishing the chain of custody is made of both a chronological and logical procedure, especially important when the evidence consists of fungible goods. In practice, this most often applies to illegal drugs which have been seized by law enforcement personnel. In such cases, the defendant at times disclaims any knowledge of possession of the controlled substance in question. Accordingly, the &quot;chain of custody&quot; documentation and testimony is presented by the prosecution to establish that the substance in evidence was in fact in the possession of the defendant.

An identifiable person must always have the physical custody of a piece of evidence. In practice, this means that a police officer or detective will take charge of a piece of evidence, document its collection, and hand it over to an evidence clerk for storage in a secure place. These transactions, and every succeeding transaction between the collection of the evidence and its appearance in court, should be completely documented chronologically in order to withstand legal challenges to the authenticity of the evidence. Documentation should include the conditions under which the evidence is gathered, the identity of all evidence handlers, duration of evidence custody, security conditions while handling or storing the evidence, and the manner in which evidence is transferred to subsequent custodians each time a transfer occurs (along with the signatures of persons involved at each step).

Maintaining a chain of custody is essential for the forensic scientist that is working on a specific criminal case. The documentation of evidence is key for maintaining a chain of custody because everything that is done to the piece of evidence must be listed and whoever came in contact with that piece of evidence is accountable for what happens to it. This prevents police officers and other law officials from contaminating the evidence or taking the piece of evidence.

===Example===
An example of &quot;chain of custody&quot; would be the recovery of a bloody knife at a murder scene:
#Officer Andrew collects the knife and places it into a container, then gives it to forensics technician Bill.
#Forensics technician Bill takes the knife to the lab and collects fingerprints and other evidence from the knife. Bill then gives the knife and all evidence gathered from the knife to evidence clerk Charlene.
#Charlene then stores the evidence until it is needed, documenting everyone who has accessed the original evidence (the knife, and original copies of the lifted fingerprints).

The chain of custody requires that from the moment the evidence is collected, every transfer of evidence from person to person be documented &quot;and&quot; that it be provable that nobody else could have accessed that evidence. It is best to keep the number of transfers as low as possible.

In the courtroom, if the defendant questions the chain of custody of the evidence it can be proven that the knife in the evidence room is the same knife found at the crime scene. However, if there are discrepancies and it cannot be proven who had the knife at a particular point in time, then the chain of custody is broken and the defendant can ask to have the resulting evidence declared inadmissible.

Chain of custody is also used in most chemical sampling situations to maintain the integrity of the sample by providing documentation of the control, transfer, and analysis of samples. Chain of custody is especially important in environmental work where sampling can identify the existence of contamination and can be used to identify the responsible party.

==Supply chain management==
ISO standard 22095, &quot;Chain of custody – General terminology and models&quot; was published in 2020. The ISO describes this standard as &quot;a simple solution&quot; designed &quot;to help boost manufacturer and consumer confidence, reducing supply chain costs by addressing issues like risk, loss of time and conditions of production&quot;.

<text>Otopeni () is a town in Ilfov County, Muntenia, Romania, neighbouring the north of Bucharest along the DN1 road to Ploiești. It has 21,750 inhabitants, of which 99.0% are ethnic Romanians. One village, Odăile, is administered by the city.

Henri Coandă International Airport is located inside Otopeni. The head office of the airline TAROM is located inside the International Departures Terminal in the airport. In addition the head office of Țiriac Air is in Otopeni.

==History==

The oldest discovered human settlements in the region are very old. On the occasion of excavations in 1966 to expand the nearby Henri Coandă International Airport, archaeologist Margaret Constantiniu of the History Museum of Bucharest identified fragments of ancient pottery and other objects that belonged to an important human settlements existing since the first period of the Iron Age. In an overlay was discovered another settlement are dated to the 10th century.

By charter of 14 February 1587, Mihnea Turcitul – voivode of Wallachia – gave Holy Trinity Monastery half to the village of Islazul and half to the village of Hodopeni (today Otopeni) mills and gypsies.

On 20 May 1620, Maria, great Băneasa, Holy Trinity monastery was given back (later Radu Vodă) half the village Hodopeni with Rumani, given by Master Villa, commanding Ruman listen. Historian Constantin C. Giurescu argued that the name Hodopeni comes from Hodopa or Hodoba.

At the end of the 19th century, Otopeni town was part of Dâmbovița County, Ilfov province, consisting of two villages, Lower Otopeni and Upper Otopeni, with 851 inhabitants in total. The commune operated a school with 29 students and two churches (one in each village). The village chambers were then part of the town Bucoveni, with 125 inhabitants.

Otopeni was transformed into a city as part of Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s Systematization plan. It replaced the semidetached houses with four-story high apartment buildings.

==Local government==
As of 2024, the mayor of Otopeni is Constantin Silviu Gheorghe, from the National Liberal Party. The Otopeni Local Council has 17 councillors, even though before the 2008 local elections, it only had 15. It is considered to be a safe Liberal district, currently having the following party composition:

==Natives==
* Lucian Croitoru (born 1957), economist
* Mihai Dobrescu (born 1992), footballer
* Ioana Tudoran (born 1948), rower

<doc id="286399" wikidata="Q787407" url="?curid=286399" title="Automated external defibrillator">
<text>An automated external defibrillator or automatic electronic defibrillator (AED) is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and is able to treat them through defibrillation, the application of electricity which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to re-establish an effective rhythm.

With simple audio and visual commands, AEDs are designed to be simple to use for the layperson, and the use of AEDs is taught in many first aid, certified first responder, and basic life support (BLS) level cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) classes.

The portable version of the defibrillator was invented in the mid-1960s by Frank Pantridge in Belfast, Northern Ireland and the first automatic, public-use defibrillator was produced by the Cardiac Resuscitation Company in the late 1970s. The unit was launched under the name Heart-Aid.

==Indications==
=== Conditions that the device treats ===
An automated external defibrillator is used in cases of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias which lead to sudden cardiac arrest, which is not the same as a heart attack. The rhythms that the device will treat are usually limited to:

# Pulseless Ventricular tachycardia (shortened to VT or V-Tach)
# Ventricular fibrillation (shortened to VF or V-Fib)

In each of these two types of shockable cardiac arrhythmia, the heart is electrically active, but in a dysfunctional pattern that does not allow it to pump and circulate blood. In ventricular tachycardia, the heart beats too fast to effectively pump blood. Ultimately, ventricular tachycardia leads to ventricular fibrillation. In ventricular fibrillation, the electrical activity of the heart becomes chaotic, preventing the ventricle from effectively pumping blood. The fibrillation in the heart decreases over time, and will eventually reach asystole.

AEDs, like all defibrillators, are not designed to shock asystole (&#x27;flat line&#x27; patterns) as this will not have a positive clinical outcome. The asystolic patient only has a chance of survival if, through a combination of CPR and cardiac stimulant drugs, one of the shockable rhythms can be established, which makes it imperative for CPR to be carried out prior to the arrival of a defibrillator.

=== Effect of delayed treatment ===
Uncorrected, these cardiac conditions (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, asystole) rapidly lead to irreversible brain damage and death, once cardiac arrest takes place. After approximately three to five minutes in cardiac arrest, irreversible brain/tissue damage may begin to occur. For every minute that a person in cardiac arrest goes without being successfully treated (by defibrillation), the chance of survival decreases by 7 percent per minute in the first three minutes, and decreases by 10 percent per minute as time advances beyond ~three minutes.

=== Requirements for use===

AEDs are designed to be used by laypersons who may not have received AED training. However, sixth-grade students have been reported to begin defibrillation within 90 seconds, as opposed to a trained operator beginning within 67 seconds. This is in contrast to more sophisticated manual and semi-automatic defibrillators used by health professionals, which can act as a pacemaker if the heart rate is too slow (bradycardia) and perform other functions which require a skilled operator able to read electrocardiograms.

Bras with a metal underwire and piercings on the torso must be removed before using the AED on someone to avoid interference. The American television show &quot;MythBusters&quot; found evidence that use of a defibrillator on a woman wearing an underwire bra can lead to arcing or fire but only in unusual and unlikely circumstances.

In a study analyzing the effects of having AEDs immediately present during Chicago&#x27;s Heart Start program over a two-year period, of 22 individuals, 18 were in a cardiac arrhythmia which AEDs can treat. Of these 18, 11 survived. Of these 11 patients, 6 were treated by bystanders with absolutely no previous training in AED use.

==Implementation==
===Placement and availability===

Automated external defibrillators are generally either kept where health professionals and first responders can use them (health facilities and ambulances) as well as public access units which can be found in public places including corporate and government offices, shopping centres, restaurants, hotels, public transport, and any other location where people may congregate.
In order to make them highly visible, public access AEDs are often brightly coloured and are mounted in protective cases near the entrance of a building. When these protective cases are opened or the defibrillator is removed, some will sound a buzzer to alert nearby staff to their removal, though this does not necessarily summon emergency services; trained AED operators should know to phone for an ambulance when sending for or using an AED. In September 2008, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation issued a &#x27;universal AED sign&#x27; to be adopted throughout the world to indicate the presence of an AED, and this is shown on the right.

A trend that is developing is the purchase of AEDs to be used in the home, particularly by those with known existing heart conditions. The number of devices in the community has grown as prices have fallen to affordable levels. There has been some concern among medical professionals that these home users do not necessarily have appropriate training, and many advocate the more widespread use of community responders, who can be appropriately trained and managed.

Typically, an AED kit will contain a face shield for providing a barrier between patient and first aider during rescue breathing; a pair of nitrile rubber gloves; a pair of trauma shears for cutting through a patient&#x27;s clothing to expose the chest; a small towel for wiping away any moisture on the chest, and a razor for shaving those with very hairy chests.

===Preparation for operation===
Most manufacturers recommend checking the AED before every period of duty or on a regular basis for fixed units. Some units need to be switched on in order to perform a self check; other models have a self check system built in with a visible indicator.

All manufacturers mark their electrode pads with an expiration date, and it is important to ensure that the pads are in date. The typical life expectancy of AED pads are between 18 and 30 months. This is usually marked on the outside of the pads. Some models are designed to make this date visible through a &#x27;window&#x27;, although others will require the opening of the case to find the date stamp.

It is also important to ensure that the AED unit&#x27;s batteries have not expired. The AED manufacturer will specify how often the batteries should be replaced. Each AED has a different recommended maintenance schedule outlined in the user manual. Common checkpoints on every checklist, however, also include a monthly check of the battery power by checking the green indicator light when powered on, condition and cleanliness of all cables and the unit, and check for the adequate supplies.

===Mechanism of operation===

An AED is &quot;automatic&quot; because of the unit&#x27;s ability to autonomously analyse the patient&#x27;s condition. To assist this, the vast majority of units have spoken prompts, and some may also have visual displays to instruct the user.

&quot;External&quot; refers to the fact that the operator applies the electrode pads to the bare chest of the victim (as opposed to internal defibrillators, which have electrodes surgically implanted inside the body of a patient).

When turned on or opened, the AED will instruct the user to connect the electrodes (pads) to the patient. Once the pads are attached, everyone should avoid touching the patient so as to avoid false readings by the unit. The pads allow the AED to examine the electrical output from the heart and determine if the patient is in a shockable rhythm (either ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia). If the device determines that a shock is warranted, it will use the battery to charge its internal capacitor in preparation to deliver the shock. The device system is not only safer - charging only when required, but also allows for a faster delivery of the electric current.

When charged, the device instructs the user to ensure no one is touching the patient and then to press a button to deliver the shock; human intervention is usually required to deliver the shock to the patient in order to avoid the possibility of accidental injury to another person (which can result from a responder or bystander touching the patient at the time of the shock). Depending on the manufacturer and particular model, after the shock is delivered most devices will analyze the patient and either instruct CPR to be performed, or prepare to administer another shock.

Many AED units have an &#x27;event memory&#x27; which store the ECG of the patient along with details of the time the unit was activated and the number and strength of any shocks delivered. Some units also have voice recording abilities to monitor the actions taken by the personnel in order to ascertain if these had any impact on the survival outcome. All this recorded data can be either downloaded to a computer or printed out so that the providing organisation or responsible body is able to see the effectiveness of both CPR and defibrillation. Some AED units even provide feedback on the quality of the compressions provided by the rescuer.

The first commercially available AEDs were all of a monophasic type, which gave a high-energy shock, up to 360 to 400 joules depending on the model. This caused increased cardiac injury and in some cases second and third-degree burns around the shock pad sites. Newer AEDs (manufactured after late 2003) have tended to utilise biphasic algorithms which give two sequential lower-energy shocks of 120–200 joules, with each shock moving in an opposite polarity between the pads. Others may give a stepped approach to energy delivery, usually in a 200J, a second 200J, then 300J, and finally 360J shock, with any further shocks also being 360 Joules. This lower-energy waveform has proven more effective in clinical tests, as well as offering a reduced rate of complications and reduced recovery time.

==Usage==
===Simplicity of use===

Unlike regular defibrillators, an automated external defibrillator (AED) requires minimal training to be used (or even no training). That is possible because all AEDs approved for use in the United States and many other countries use an electronic voice to prompt users through each step. Many AEDs now include visual prompts in case of a hearing impaired user. Most units are designed for use by non-medical operators. Their ease of use has given rise to the notion of public access defibrillation (PAD).

An AED automatically diagnoses the heart rhythm and determines if a shock is needed. Automatic models will administer the shock without the user&#x27;s command. Semi-automatic models will tell the user that a shock is needed, but the user must tell the machine to do so, usually by pressing a button. In most circumstances, the user cannot override a &quot;no shock&quot; advisory by an AED. Some AEDs may be used on children – those under 55 lbs (25 kg) in weight or under age 8. If a particular model of AED is approved for pediatric use, .

===Benefit===
Observational studies have shown that in out of hospital cardiac arrest, public access defibrillators when used were associated with 40% median survival. When operated by non-dispatched lay first responders they have the highest likelihood of leading to survival.

===Liability===
====United States====
Automated external defibrillators are now easy enough to use that most states in the United States include the &quot;good faith&quot; use of an AED by any person under Good Samaritan laws. &quot;Good faith&quot; protection under a Good Samaritan law means that a volunteer responder (not acting as a part of one&#x27;s occupation) cannot be held civilly liable for the harm or death of a victim by providing improper or inadequate care, given that the harm or death was not intentional and the responder was acting within the limits of their training and in good faith. In the United States, Good Samaritan laws provide some protection for the use of AEDs by trained and untrained responders. AEDs create little liability if used correctly; NREMT-B and many state Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training and many CPR classes incorporate or offer AED education as a part of their program.

====Canada====
In addition to Good Samaritan laws, Ontario, Canada also has the &quot;Chase McEachern Act (Heart Defibrillator Civil Liability), 2007 (Bill 171 – Subsection N)&quot;, passed in June, 2007, which protects individuals from liability for damages that may occur from their use of an AED to save someone&#x27;s life at the immediate scene of an emergency unless damages are caused by gross negligence.

====Australia====
Legislation in Australia varies by state, with separate liability issues relating to providing and using AED equipment. 
Each state and territory has enacted &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; laws that offer legal protection to a person who gives assistance in a medical emergency - the standard of care expected corresponds to their training (or lack of training).
In New South Wales, the Work Health and Safety Regulation (2011) requires an employer to use a risk assessment to ensure that there is adequate provision for first aid; when there is a sufficient risk it warrants providing a defibrillator.

===Reliability===
In 2012, AED&#x27;s (automated external defibrillators) were under scrutiny by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which considered reclassifying AEDs as class III premarket approval devices. Technical malfunctions likely contributed to more than 750 deaths in the 5-year period between 2004 and 2009, in most cases by component failures or design errors. During the same period, up to 70 types of AEDs were recalled, including recalls from every AED manufacturer in the world. 
In January and February 2015, the FDA issued this news release: &quot;The FDA issued a final order that will require AED manufacturers to submit premarket approval applications (PMAs), which undergo a more rigorous review than what was required to market these devices in the past. The agency&#x27;s strengthened review will focus on the critical requirements needed to ensure the safety and reliability of AEDs and their necessary accessories, including batteries, pad electrodes, adapters and hardware keys for pediatric use.&quot;

In the United Kingdom there is concern that poor maintenance may make public defibrillators unreliable. The &quot;Henley Standard&quot; reported on 21 July 2017 that more than half the defibrillators in Henley-on-Thames and the surrounding area were at risk of failing, either because of low battery power or because adhesive pads had deteriorated.

==History==
The first use of an external defibrillator on a human was in 1947 by Claude Beck. The portable version of the external defibrillator was invented in 1957 by Frank Pantridge in Belfast, Northern Ireland, a pioneer in emergency medical treatment. Pantridge&#x27;s defibrillator required a trained operator to perform the shock procedure and charted a course for many new innovations in external defibrillation.

In the late 1970s the Heart-Aid was developed as the first truly automated external defibrillator that was designed for the public. The principles of ABC assessment and a human voice relaying instructions helped bystanders respond to a sudden cardiac event while waiting for the first responders to get to scene. Many of the early innovations in the Heart-Aid model are still part of the current generation of AEDs, although some innovations, like the airway electrode have fallen from use.

==Case studies==

In a study published in 2017, researchers in Poland selected the main entrances of buildings which had AEDs, although the researchers themselves did not know the exact locations of the devices. In drills of pretend heart attack, the average time to bring the AED to the patient was 96 seconds, with a time that ranged from 52 to 144 seconds. This met the three minute goal. In some cases, the use of the AED required the continuous presence of building personnel. Future improvements include more obvious signage and public-access AEDs which do not require a staff member of the building to either retrieve or use the device.

<doc id="286400" wikidata="Q724235" url="?curid=286400" title="Robert, Count of Mortain">
<text>Robert, Count of Mortain, first [[Earl of Cornwall]] of 2nd creation (–) was a Norman nobleman and the half-brother (on their mother&#x27;s side) of King William the Conqueror. He was one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings and as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 was one of the greatest landholders in his half-brother&#x27;s new Kingdom of England.

==Life==
Robert was the son of Herluin de Conteville and Herleva of Falaise and brother of Odo of Bayeux. Robert was born in Normandy, a half-brother of William the Conqueror. and was probably not more than a year or so younger than his brother Odo, born . About 1035, Herluin, as Vicomte of Conteville, along with his wife Herleva and Robert, founded Grestain Abbey.

===Count of Mortain===
Around 1049 his brother Duke William made him Count of Mortain, in place of William Werlenc, who had been banished by Duke William; according to Orderic Vitalis, on a single word. William Werlenc was a grandson of Duke Richard I and therefore a cousin once removed to William, Duke of Normandy. Securing the southern border of Normandy was critical to Duke William and Robert was entrusted with this key county which guarded the borders of Brittany and Bellême.

===Conquest of England===
In early 1066, Robert was present at both the first Council of Lillebonne, that of William&#x27;s inner circle, and the second larger council held to discuss the Duke&#x27;s planned conquest of England. Robert agreed to provide 120 ships to the invasion fleet, which was more than any other of William&#x27;s magnates. Robert was one of those few known to have been at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He is pictured at a dinner at Pevensey on the Bayeux Tapestry, seated with his brothers William and Odo on the day of the landing in England. When granting the monastery of St Michael&#x27;s Mount in Cornwall to the Norman monastery on the Mont-Saint-Michel in Normandy, Robert recorded that he had fought at the Battle of Hastings under the banner of St Michael (&quot;habens in bello Sancti Michaelis vexillum&quot;).

===Lands granted by William the Conqueror===
Robert&#x27;s contribution to the success of the invasion was clearly regarded as highly significant by the Conqueror, who awarded him a large share of the spoils; in total 797 manors at the time of Domesday. The greatest concentration of his honours lay in Cornwall where he held virtually all of that Earldom and was considered by some the Earl of Cornwall. While Robert held lands in twenty counties, the majority of his holdings in certain counties was as few as five manors. The overall worth of his estates was £2100. He administered most of his southwestern holdings from Launceston, Cornwall, and Montacute in Somerset. The holding of single greatest importance was the rape of Pevensey (east Sussex) which protected one of the more vulnerable parts of the south coast of England.

==Later life==
In 1069, together with Robert of Eu, he led an army against a force of Danes in Lindsey and effected great slaughter against them. After that there is little mention of Robert who appears to have been an absentee landholder spending the majority of his time in Normandy. Along with his brother Odo he participated in a revolt in 1088 against William II but afterwards he was pardoned. Robert died in 1095, possibly on 9 December, and chose to be buried at the Abbey of Grestain, near his father and next to his first wife Matilda.

==Character==
He was described by William of Malmesbury in his &quot;Gesta Regum Anglorum&quot; as a man of stupid dull disposition (&quot;crassi et hebetis ingenii&quot;). William the Conqueror considered him one of his greatest supporters and trusted him with the important county of Mortain. Further clues to his character are found in the &quot;Vita&quot; of Vitalis of Savigny, a very wise monk whom Robert sought out as his chaplain. One incident tells of Robert beating his wife and Vital, intervening, threatened to end the marriage if Robert did not repent. In still another entry Vital tells of his leaving Robert&#x27;s service abruptly and after being escorted back to him, Robert begged for Vital&#x27;s pardon for his actions. Overall, Robert was proficient in every duty William assigned him. He was a religious man yet ill-tempered enough to beat his wife, but was not known as a man of great wisdom.

==Family==
Robert was married to Matilda, daughter of Roger de Montgomery, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, before 1066 and together they had:

* William, Count of Mortain, who succeeded him, was offered to wed Mary of Scotland.
* Agnes who married André de Vitré, seigneur of Vitré.
* Denise, married in 1078 to Guy, 2nd Sire de Laval.
* Emma of Mortain (ca. 1058 – 1080), married to William IV of Toulouse, Duke of Narbonne.

Through Emma&#x27;s daughter Philippa, Countess of Toulouse, Robert was the great-great-grandfather of Eleanor of Aquitaine and hence an ancestor of all English monarchs after Henry II.

After Matilda de Montgomery&#x27;s death in 1084 Robert secondly married Almodis. The couple had no children.

==Portrayals on screen==
On screen, Robert has been portrayed by Gordon Whiting in the two-part BBC TV play &quot;Conquest&quot; (1966), part of the series &quot;Theatre 625&quot;, and by Richard Ireson in the TV drama &quot;Blood Royal: William the Conqueror&quot; (1990).

<doc id="286401" wikidata="Q257631" url="?curid=286401" title="Bucharest Henri Coandă International Airport">
<text>Bucharest Henri Coandă International Airport () is Romania&#x27;s busiest international airport, located in Otopeni, north of Bucharest&#x27;s city centre. It is currently one of the two airports serving the capital of Romania. The other is the smaller Aurel Vlaicu Airport, used mostly for private flights. The airport covers 605 hectares (1,495 acres) of land and contains two parallel runways, both 3,500 meters long.

The airport is named after Romanian flight pioneer Henri Coandă, builder of Coandă-1910 aircraft and discoverer of the Coandă effect of fluidics. Prior to May 2004, the official name was &quot;Bucharest Otopeni International Airport&quot; (Romanian: &quot;Aeroportul Internațional București Otopeni&quot;). Henri Coandă International Airport serves as headquarters for TAROM, the country&#x27;s national airline. It also serves as a base of operations for low-cost airlines Animawings, Ryanair and Wizz Air. It is managed by The National Company Bucharest Airports S.A. (&quot;Compania Națională Aeroporturi București S.A.&quot;). The military section of the airport is used as the 90th Airlift Base of the Romanian Air Force.

==History==
===Early years===

Originally, the airport in Otopeni was intended to be used as a Romanian civil aviation and military training center. During World War II, it was used as an airbase by the Luftwaffe. It was further developed in 1943, becoming one of the principal Luftwaffe bases around Bucharest. By 1944, it featured a beam approach system and two concrete runways, one of aligned North-South and one of aligned East-West. After 23 August 1944, the airport was used to launch air raids on Bucharest in support of the German efforts to overthrow the new government. It was bombed by the USAAF on 26 August and taken over by the Romanian military in the aftermath.

Until 1965, it was a major airfield for the Romanian Air Force, with Băneasa Airport serving as Bucharest&#x27;s commercial airport. In 1965, with the growth of air traffic, the Otopeni airbase was converted to a commercial airport. The runway was modernized and extended to from the previous , making it one of the longest in Europe at that time.

In August 1969, when United States President Richard Nixon visited Romania, a VIP lounge was inaugurated. A new passenger terminal (designed by Cezar Lăzărescu), with a capacity of 1,200,000 passengers per year, was opened on 13 April 1970, for domestic and international flights. An improvement program added a second runway in 1986, expanding capacity to 35 aircraft movements per hour.

In 1992, Otopeni Airport became a regular member of Airports Council International (ACI).

===Expansion since the 1990s===
The first stage of the plan (Phase I), taking place between 1994 and 1998, involved the construction of a new departures terminal and of a new airside concourse with five jetways and nine gates (referred to as &#x27;the Finger&#x27;) as well as the extension of airport ramps and of their associated taxiways.

The second phase (labeled Phase II/IIe) of the plan led to the construction of a terminal dedicated to domestic flights and of a multi-story car park (2003), the complete overhaul of the control tower (between 2005 and 2007) as well as the transformation of the old terminal building into a dedicated arrivals hall (in 2000). During the same phase, two high-speed taxiways (Victor and Whiskey) were constructed. Phase II was completed in 2007.

TAROM ended its unprofitable service to New York City in November 2003. In June 2007, Delta Air Lines began flying the same route with Boeing 767s. The company made the link seasonal in 2008. Delta terminated it in September 2009 due to the recession and difficulty competing with other airlines. HiSky has commenced service to New York in June 2024, reconnecting Bucharest to the United States.

The third stage of the plan (Phase III), which started in 2009, involved the extension of the airside concourse (&#x27;the Finger&#x27;) with 15 new gates (nine of which have jetways), as well as the expansion of the Departure Hall (with 8 new gates). The airside concourse extension, designed by Studio Capelli Architettura &amp; Associati, and measuring , was inaugurated on 29 March 2011. It was followed, in November 2012, by the extension of the Departure Hall to a total area of .

In March 2012, all air traffic except for business air traffic was transferred from Aurel Vlaicu International Airport (at that time Bucharest&#x27;s low-cost hub) to Henri Coandă International Airport. Air Canada Rouge introduced seasonal routes to Toronto and Montreal in June 2018. The carrier operated the flights with Boeing 767s.

===Future development===
Beyond Phase III, a new terminal building (Henri Coandă 2) at the eastern end of the current location is envisaged. The new building is expected to include a large commercial space. Henri Coandă 2 will be of a modular design, consisting of four separate buildings, each capable of handling 5 million passengers annually. Each module will be built as traffic demands dictate. By 2030, Terminal 2 alone should be able to handle the expected volume of 20 million passengers per year. The terminal will be directly connected to the A3 motorway and to the railway system. However, the plans might get delayed due to funding problems.

On 18 January 2021, it has been announced that the airport purchased all the land it needs in order to begin the expansion. However, on 15 May 2023, the Minister of Transport and Infrastructure declared that a new terminal will not be built in the near future, because it is not necessary, a declaration which sparked criticism.

==Terminals==
The airport&#x27;s facilities consist of a single terminal with three main facilities (colloquially referred to as &quot;Terminals&quot;): the Departures Hall/Terminal, the Arrivals Hall/Terminal, and the Finger Terminal (the airside concourse). A walkway with shops connects the departures and arrivals buildings. The airside concourse is organized in two (domestic and international) passengers flows. The entire terminal has 104 check-in desks, 38 gates (of which 14 are equipped with jetways), and a total floor area of .

==Airlines and destinations==

===Passenger===
The following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at Bucharest Henri Coandă Airport:


===Cargo===
==Statistics==
===Passengers===

In 2018, 13,824,830 passengers passed through the airport, an increase of 7.95% compared to 2017. In 2018, the airport handled 13.8 million passengers (63.3% of the total number of passengers carried by Romanian airports) and 39,534 tons of cargo (81.4% of the total amount of cargo handled by Romanian airports).

===Busiest routes===
==Ground transportation==

===Rail===

An airport rail link service to the main railway station, Gara de Nord (Bucharest North), runs from the Airport railway station located near the parking lot of the Arrivals hall. As of August 2021, the trains, alternately operated by CFR and TFC depart every 40 minutes, seven days a week. A one-way trip takes 15–20 minutes.

A new Metro Line M6 is also planned, connecting the airport to the Gara de Nord train station, and integrating the airport into the Bucharest Metro network.

===Bus===
Henri Coandă Airport is connected to the public transport company STB system. The 100 route provides 24/7 express bus service to the city center (Piața Unirii).

===Car===
The airport is north of central Bucharest, to which it is connected by the DN1 national road. The DN1 also connects the airport with the nearby A0 motorway. The A3 motorway will connect the future terminal 2 and the city.

===Taxi and ride-share===
As of May 2013, taxis serving Henri Coandă Airport can be ordered using a touch screen system in the arrivals terminal, allowing the taxi drivers to enter the pick-up area. This measure was taken after many complaints from passengers who were being overcharged when using illegal, high-price taxis. Uber and Bolt are also available at the airport.

==Incidents and accidents==
*On 9 February 1989, a TAROM Tupolev TU-154 crashed during a training flight following a simulated engine failure when a flight crew member raised the flaps too soon. All 5 occupants were killed.
*On 31 March 1995, TAROM Flight 371, an Airbus A310-324 registered as YR-LCC, simultaneously experienced asymmetric thrust during climb and one of the pilots being incapacitated. The plane crashed near Balotești just two minutes after takeoff. All 60 people aboard were killed.
*On 30 December 2007, a TAROM Boeing 737-300 (YR-BGC &quot;Constanța&quot;), flying Flight 3107 hit a car on the runway while taking off for Sharm-el-Sheikh. The aircraft stopped beside the runway and was severely damaged.

<text>Tracheotomy (, ), or tracheostomy, is a surgical airway management procedure which consists of making an incision on the front of the neck to open a direct airway to the trachea. The resulting stoma (hole) can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheal tube (or tracheostomy tube) to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of the nose or mouth.

==Etymology and terminology==

The etymology of the word &quot;tracheotomy&quot; comes from two Greek words: the root &quot;tom-&quot; (from Greek τομή &quot;tomḗ&quot;) meaning &quot;to cut&quot;, and the word &quot;trachea&quot; (from Greek τραχεία &quot;tracheía&quot;). The word &quot;tracheostomy&quot;, including the root &quot;stom-&quot; (from Greek στόμα &quot;stóma&quot;) meaning &quot;mouth&quot;, refers to the making of a semi-permanent or permanent opening and to the opening itself. Some sources offer different definitions of the above terms. Part of the ambiguity is due to the uncertainty of the intended permanence of the stoma (hole) at the time it is created.

==Indications==
There are four main reasons why someone would receive a tracheotomy:

# Emergency airway access
# Airway access for prolonged mechanical ventilation
# Functional or mechanical upper airway obstruction
# Decreased/incompetent clearance of tracheobronchial secretions

In the acute (short term) setting, indications for tracheotomy include such conditions as severe facial trauma, tumors of the head and neck (e.g., cancers, branchial cleft cysts), and acute angioedema and inflammation of the head and neck. In the context of failed tracheal intubation, either tracheotomy or cricothyrotomy may be performed.
In the chronic (long-term) setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and tracheal toilet (e.g., comatose patients, extensive surgery involving the head and neck). Tracheotomy may result in a significant reduction in the administration of sedatives and vasopressors, as well as the duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU).

In extreme cases, the procedure may be indicated as a treatment for severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) seen in patients intolerant of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. The reason tracheostomy works well for OSA is because it is the &quot;only&quot; surgical procedure that completely bypasses the upper airway. This procedure was commonly performed for obstructive sleep apnea until the 1980s, when other procedures such as the uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, genioglossus advancement, and maxillomandibular advancement surgeries were described as alternative surgical modalities for OSA.

If prolonged ventilation is required, tracheostomy is usually considered. The timing of this procedure is dependent on the clinical situation and an individual&#x27;s preference. An international multicenter study in 2000 determined that the median time between starting mechanical ventilation and receiving a tracheostomy was 11 days. Although the definition varies depending on hospital and provider, early tracheostomy can be considered to be less than 10 days (2 to 14 days) and late tracheostomy to be 10 days or more.

==Alternatives==
Biphasic cuirass ventilation is a form of non-invasive mechanical ventilation that can — in a small subset of cases — allow people to avoid a tracheostomy.

==Components==

A tracheostomy tube may be single or dual lumen, and also cuffed or uncuffed. A dual lumen tracheostomy tube consists of an outer cannula or main shaft, an inner cannula, and an obturator. The obturator is used when inserting the tracheostomy tube to guide the placement of the outer cannula and is removed once the outer cannula is in place. The outer cannula remains in place but, because of the buildup of secretions, there is an inner cannula that may be removed for cleaning after use or it may be replaced. Single-lumen tracheostomy tubes do not have a removable inner cannula, suitable for narrower airways. Cuffed tracheostomy tubes have inflatable balloons at the end of the tube to secure them in place. A tracheostomy tube may be fenestrated with one or several holes to let air through the larynx, allowing speech.

Special tracheostomy tube valves (such as the Passy-Muir valve) have been created to assist people in their speech. The patient can inhale through the unidirectional tube. Upon expiration, pressure causes the valve to close, redirecting air around the tube, past the vocal folds, producing sound.

==Surgical procedure==
===Open surgical tracheotomy (OST)===
The typical procedure done is the open surgical tracheotomy (OST) and is usually done in a sterile operating room. The optimal patient position involves a cushion under the shoulders to extend the neck. Commonly a transverse (horizontal) incision is made two fingerbreadths above the suprasternal notch. Alternatively, a vertical incision can be made in the midline of the neck from the thyroid cartilage to just above the suprasternal notch. Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and strap muscles (a specific group of neck muscles) are retracted aside to expose the thyroid isthmus, which can be cut or retracted upwards. After proper identification of the cricoid cartilage and placement of a tracheal hook to steady the trachea and pull it forward, the trachea is cut open, either through the space between cartilage rings or vertically across multiple rings (cruciate incision). Occasionally a section of a tracheal cartilage ring may be removed to make insertion of the tube easier. Once the incision is made, a properly sized tube is inserted. The tube is connected to a ventilator and adequate ventilation and oxygenation is confirmed. The tracheotomy apparatus is then attached to the neck with tracheotomy ties, skin sutures, or both.

===Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT)===
The first widely accepted percutaneous tracheotomy technique was described by Pat Ciaglia, a New York surgeon, in 1985. The next widely used technique was developed in 1989 by Bill Griggs, an Australian intensive care specialist. In 1995, Fantoni developed a translaryngeal approach of percutaneous tracheostomy. The Griggs and Ciaglia Blue Rhino techniques are the two main techniques in current use. A number of comparison studies have been undertaken between these two techniques with no clear differences emerging. An advantage of PDT over OST is the ability to perform the procedure at the patient&#x27;s bedside. This significantly decreases costs and time/people-power needed for an operating room (OR) procedure. Contraindications for percutaneous tracheostomy include infection at the site of tracheostomy, uncontrolled bleeding disorder, unstable cardiopulmonary status, patient unable to stay still, abnormal anatomy of the tracheolaryngeal structures.

==Risks and complications==
As with most other surgical procedures, some cases are more difficult than others. Surgery on children is more difficult because of their smaller size. Difficulties such as a short neck and bigger thyroid glands make the trachea hard to open. There are other difficulties with patients with irregular necks, the obese, and those with a large goitre.

The many possible complications include hemorrhage, loss of airway, subcutaneous emphysema, wound infections, stoma cellulites, fracture of tracheal rings, poor placement of the tracheostomy tube, and bronchospasm.

Early complications include infection, hemorrhage, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, tracheoesophageal fistula, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and tube displacement. Delayed complications include tracheal-innominate artery fistula, tracheal stenosis, delayed tracheoesophageal fistula, and tracheocutaneous fistula.

A 2013 systematic review (published cases from 1985 to April 2013) studied the complications and risk factors of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT), identifying major causes of fatality to be hemorrhage (38.0%), airway complications (29.6%), tracheal perforation (15.5%), and pneumothorax (5.6%) A similar systematic review in 2017 (cases from 1990 to 2015) studying fatality in both open surgical tracheotomy (OST) and PDT identified similar rates of mortality and causes of death between the two techniques.

Hemorrhage is rare, but the most likely cause of fatality after a tracheostomy. It usually occurs due to a tracheoarterial fistula, an abnormal connection between the trachea and nearby blood vessels, and most commonly manifests between 3 days to 6 weeks after the procedure is done. Fistulas can result from incorrectly positioned equipment, high cuff pressures causing pressure sores or mucosal damage, a low surgical trachea site, repetitive neck movement, radiotherapy, or prolonged intubation.

A potential risk factor identified in a 2013 systematic review of the percutaneous technique was the lack of bronchoscopic guidance. Use of the bronchoscope, an instrument inserted through a patient&#x27;s mouth for internal visualization of the airway, can help with proper placement of instruments and better visualization of anatomical structures. However, this can also be dependent on the skills and familiarity of the surgeon with both the procedure and the patient&#x27;s anatomy.

There are a multitude of potential complications related to the airway. The main causes of mortality during PDT include dislodgment of the tube, loss of airway during procedure and misplacement of the tube. One of the more urgent complications include displacement or dislodgment of the tracheotomy tube, either spontaneously or during a tube change. Although uncommon (&lt; 1/1000 tracheostomy tube days), the associated fatality is high due to the loss of airway. Due to the seriousness of such a situation, individuals with a tracheotomy tube should consult with their healthcare providers to have a specific, written, emergency intubation and tracheostomy recannulation (reinsertion) plan prepared in advance.

Tracheal stenosis, otherwise known as an abnormal narrowing of the airway, is a possible long term complication. The most common symptom of stenosis is gradually-worsening difficulty with breathing (dyspnea). However incidence is low, ranging from 0.6 to 2.8% with increased rates if major bleeding or wound infections are present. A 2016 systematic review identified a higher rate of tracheal stenosis in individuals who underwent a surgical tracheostomy, as compared to PDT, however the difference was not statistically significant.

A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheostomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and a procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States. A 2013 systematic review calculated procedural mortality to be 0.17% or 1 in 600 cases. Multiple systematic reviews identified no significant difference in rates of mortality, major bleeding, or wound infection between the percutaneous or open surgical methods.

Specifically a 2017 systematic review calculated the most common causes of death and their frequencies, out of all tracheotomies, to be hemorrhage (OST: 0.26%, PDT: 0.19%), loss of airway (OST: 0.21%, PDT: 0.20%), and misplacement of tube (OST: 0.11%, PDT: 0.20%).

A 2003 American cadaveric study identified multiple tracheal ring fractures with the Ciaglia Blue Rhino technique as a complication occurring in 100% of their small series of cases. The comparative study above also identified ring fractures in 9 of 30 live patients while another small series identified ring fractures in 5 of their 20 patients. The long term significance of tracheal ring fractures is unknown.

==History==
===Ancient history===
Tracheotomy was first potentially depicted on Egyptian artifacts in 3600 BC. Hippocrates condemned the practice of tracheotomy as incurring an unacceptable risk of damage to the carotid artery. Warning against the possibility of death from inadvertent laceration of the carotid artery during tracheotomy, he instead advocated the practice of tracheal intubation.

Despite the concerns of Hippocrates, it is believed that an early tracheotomy was performed by Asclepiades of Bithynia, who lived in Rome around 100 BC. Galen and Aretaeus, both of whom lived in Rome in the 2nd century AD, credit Asclepiades as being the first physician to perform a non-emergency tracheotomy. Antyllus, another Roman-era Greek physician of the 2nd century AD, supported tracheotomy when treating oral diseases. He refined the technique to be more similar to that used in modern times, recommending that a transverse incision be made between the third and fourth tracheal rings for the treatment of life-threatening airway obstruction.

===Medieval world===
The 7th century Byzantine physician Paul of Aegina, an advocate of the procedure, acknowledged previous Greek authors&#x27; works on the subject of tracheotomies and provided descriptions of the procedure in his own works. In 1000, Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (936–1013), an Arab who lived in Arabic Spain, published the 30-volume &quot;Kitab al-Tasrif&quot;, the first illustrated work on surgery. He never performed a tracheotomy, but he did treat a slave girl who had cut her own throat in a suicide attempt. Al-Zahrawi (known to Europeans as &quot;Albucasis&quot;) sewed up the wound and the girl recovered, thereby proving that an incision in the larynx could heal. Circa AD 1020, Avicenna (980–1037) described tracheal intubation in &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; in order to facilitate breathing. The first clear description of the tracheotomy operation for treating asphyxiation was given by Ibn Zuhr (1091–1161) in the 12th century. According to Mostafa Shehata, Ibn Zuhr (also known as Avenzoar) successfully practiced the tracheotomy procedure on a goat, justifying Galen&#x27;s approval of the operation.

===16th–18th centuries===

The European Renaissance brought with it significant advances in all scientific fields, particularly surgery. Increased knowledge of anatomy was a major factor in these developments. Surgeons became increasingly open to experimental surgery on the trachea. During this period, many surgeons attempted to perform tracheotomies, for various reasons and with various methods. Many suggestions were put forward, but little actual progress was made toward making the procedure more successful. The tracheotomy remained a dangerous operation with a very low success rate, and many surgeons still considered the tracheotomy to be a useless and dangerous procedure. The high mortality rate for this operation, which had not improved, supported their position. From the period 1500 to 1832 there are only 28 known reports of tracheotomy.

In 1543, Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) wrote that tracheal intubation and subsequent artificial respiration could be life-saving. Antonio Musa Brassavola (1490–1554) of Ferrara treated a patient with peritonsillar abscess by tracheotomy after the patient had been refused by barber surgeons. The patient apparently made a complete recovery, and Brassavola published his account in 1546. This operation has been identified as the first recorded successful tracheostomy, despite many ancient references to the trachea and possibly to its opening. Ambroise Paré (1510–1590) described suture of tracheal lacerations in the mid-16th century. One patient survived despite a concomitant injury to the internal jugular vein. Another sustained wounds to the trachea and esophagus and died.

Towards the end of the 16th century, anatomist and surgeon Hieronymus Fabricius (1533–1619) described a useful technique for tracheotomy in his writings, although he had never actually performed the operation himself. He advised using a vertical incision and was the first to introduce the idea of a tracheostomy tube. This was a straight, short cannula that incorporated wings to prevent the tube from advancing too far into the trachea. He recommended the operation only as a last resort, to be used in cases of airway obstruction by foreign bodies or secretions. Fabricius&#x27; description of the tracheotomy procedure is similar to that used today. Giulio Cesare Casseri (1552–1616) succeeded Fabricius as professor of anatomy at the University of Padua and published his own writings regarding technique and equipment for tracheotomy. Casseri recommended using a curved silver tube with several holes in it. Marco Aurelio Severino (1580–1656), a skillful surgeon and anatomist, performed multiple successful tracheotomies during a diphtheria epidemic in Naples in 1610, using the vertical incision technique recommended by Fabricius. He also developed his own version of a trocar.

In 1620 the French surgeon Nicholas Habicot (1550–1624), surgeon of the Duke of Nemours and anatomist, published a report of four successful &quot;bronchotomies&quot; which he had performed. One of these is the first recorded case of a tracheotomy for the removal of a foreign body, in this instance a blood clot in the larynx of a stabbing victim. He also described the first tracheotomy to be performed on a pediatric patient. A 14-year-old boy swallowed a bag containing 9 gold coins in an attempt to prevent its theft by a highwayman. The object became lodged in his esophagus, obstructing his trachea. Habicot suggested that the operation might also be effective for patients with inflammation of the larynx. He developed equipment for this surgical procedure which displayed similarities to modern designs (except for his use of a single-tube cannula).

Sanctorius (1561–1636) is believed to be the first to use a trocar in the operation, and he recommended leaving the cannula in place for a few days following the operation. Early tracheostomy devices are illustrated in Habicot&#x27;s &quot;Question Chirurgicale&quot; and Casseri&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Tabulae anatomicae&quot; in 1627. Thomas Fienus (1567–1631), Professor of Medicine at the University of Louvain, was the first to use the word &quot;tracheotomy&quot; in 1649, but this term was not commonly used until a century later. Georg Detharding (1671–1747), professor of anatomy at the University of Rostock, treated a drowning victim with tracheostomy in 1714.

===19th century===
In the 1820s, the tracheotomy began to be recognized as a legitimate means of treating severe airway obstruction. In 1832, French physician Pierre Bretonneau employed it as a last resort to treat a case of diphtheria. In 1852, Bretonneau&#x27;s student Armand Trousseau reported a series of 169 tracheotomies (158 of which were for croup, and 11 for &quot;chronic maladies of the larynx&quot;) In 1858, John Snow was the first to report tracheotomy and cannulation of the trachea for the administration of chloroform anesthesia in an animal model. In 1871, the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844–1924) published a paper describing the first successful elective human tracheotomy to be performed for the purpose of administration of general anesthesia. In 1880, the Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, as well as in the setting of general anesthesia with chloroform. At last, in 1880 Morell Mackenzie&#x27;s book discussed the symptoms indicating a tracheotomy and when the operation is absolutely necessary.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century, physicians began to use the tracheotomy in the treatment of patients affected by paralytic poliomyelitis who required mechanical ventilation. However, surgeons continued to debate various aspects of the tracheotomy well into the 20th century. Many techniques were described and employed, along with many different surgical instruments and tracheal tubes. Surgeons could not seem to reach a consensus on where or how the tracheal incision should be made, arguing whether the &quot;high tracheotomy&quot; or the &quot;low tracheotomy&quot; was more beneficial. The currently used surgical tracheotomy technique was described in 1909 by Chevalier Jackson of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Jackson emphasised the importance of postoperative care, which dramatically reduced the death rate. By 1965, the surgical anatomy was thoroughly and widely understood, antibiotics were widely available and useful for treating postoperative infections, and other major complications had also become more manageable.

==Society and culture==
Notable individuals who have or have had a tracheotomy include Catherine Zeta-Jones, Mika Häkkinen, Stephen Hawking, Connie Culp, Christopher Reeve, Roy Horn, William Rehnquist, Gabby Giffords, George Michael, Val Kilmer, and many others.

Across movies and TV shows, there are many situations where an emergency procedure is done on an individual&#x27;s neck to re-establish an airway. An example is in the 2008 horror film, &quot;Saw V&quot;, in which a character being drowned from the neck up performs a manual tracheotomy, stabbing his neck with a pen to create an airway to breathe through. The most common procedure is a cricothyrotomy (or &quot;crike&quot;), which is an incision through the skin and cricothyroid membrane. This is often confused or misnamed as a tracheotomy (or &quot;trach&quot;) and vice versa. However, they are quite different based on location of the opening and length of time the alternate airway is needed.

Another example of an emergency attempt at this procedure is featured in the 2013 comedy film The Heat, where Sandra Bullock’s character, Sarah Ashburn, attempts to perform the operation on a person choking on a pancake in a Denny&#x27;s, but fails. Melissa McCarthy’s character, Detective Mullens, then presses hard on the man&#x27;s chest, causing the piece of food to be expelled from his mouth.

<doc id="286404" wikidata="Q2907274" url="?curid=286404" title="Bowers v. Hardwick">
<text>Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186 (1986), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court that upheld, in a 5–4 ruling, the constitutionality of a Georgia sodomy law criminalizing oral and anal sex in private between consenting adults, in this case with respect to homosexual sodomy, though the law did not differentiate between homosexual and heterosexual sodomy. It was overturned in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; (2003), though the statute had already been struck down by the Georgia Supreme Court in 1998. 

The majority opinion, by Justice Byron White, reasoned that the U.S. Constitution did not confer &quot;a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy&quot;. A concurring opinion by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger cited the &quot;ancient roots&quot; of prohibitions against homosexual sex, quoting William Blackstone&#x27;s description of homosexual sex as an &quot;infamous crime against nature&quot;, worse than rape, and &quot;a crime not fit to be named&quot;. Burger concluded: &quot;To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.&quot; 

The senior dissent, by Justice Harry Blackmun, framed the issue as revolving around the right to privacy. Blackmun&#x27;s dissent accused the Court of an &quot;almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity&quot; and an &quot;overall refusal to consider the broad principles that have informed our treatment of privacy in specific cases.&quot; In response to invocations of religious taboos against homosexuality, Blackmun wrote: &quot;That certain, but by no means all, religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry. The legitimacy of secular legislation depends, instead, on whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine.&quot;

Scholarly examinations of the case overwhelmingly sided with the dissenting minority. Some of the justices, including Lewis F. Powell, later said that they should not have joined the majority, although Powell also indicated in 1990 that the decision was of little importance. Seventeen years after &quot;Bowers&quot;, the Supreme Court directly overruled its decision in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, holding that anti-sodomy laws are unconstitutional. In &quot;Lawrence&quot;, the Supreme Court subsequently based its decision on the American tradition of non-interference with private sexual decisions between consenting adults and on the notions of personal autonomy to define one&#x27;s own relationships.

==Background==
In early July 1982, Atlanta Police Department officer Keith Torick issued Michael Hardwick a citation for public drinking after witnessing Hardwick throw a beer bottle into a trash can outside the gay bar where he worked, allegedly observing him violating the city&#x27;s ordinance that prohibits drinking in public. Due to a clerical error on the citation issued by Torick, Hardwick missed his court date and Torick obtained a warrant for Hardwick&#x27;s arrest. Hardwick then settled the matter by paying a $50 fine at a court office, but Torick showed up at Hardwick&#x27;s house three weeks later, on August 3, to serve the now-invalid warrant. At the time, an unrelated guest of Hardwick was sleeping on the couch in Hardwick&#x27;s living room; at around 8:30 am, Officer Torick entered the house (the front door may have been ajar) and awoke the guest, then proceeded down a hallway towards Hardwick&#x27;s bedroom. The officer opened the bedroom door, and Torick observed Hardwick and a companion engaged in mutual, consensual oral sex.

Hardwick was angry at the intrusion and threatened to have Torick fired for entering his home. Torick later stated that he &quot;would never have made the case if [Hardwick] hadn&#x27;t had an attitude problem.&quot; Torick then arrested both men for sodomy, a felony under Georgia law that carried a sentence of one to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment. District Attorney Lewis Slaton chose not to prosecute the sodomy charge, considering that the warrant had expired, and his own belief that the sodomy law should not be used to prosecute consensual sexual activity.

Hardwick then sued Michael Bowers, the attorney general of Georgia, in federal court for a declaratory judgment that the state&#x27;s sodomy law was invalid. He charged that as a non-celibate gay man, he was liable to eventually be prosecuted for his activities. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had been searching for a &quot;perfect test case&quot; to challenge anti-sodomy laws, and Hardwick&#x27;s cause presented the one they were looking for. They approached Hardwick, who agreed to be represented by ACLU attorneys.

In the lower federal courts, Hardwick was represented by attorney Kathleen Wilde. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, where it was dismissed, with the Court ruling in favor of Bowers. Hardwick appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the lower court, finding that the Georgia sodomy statute was an infringement upon Hardwick&#x27;s constitutional rights. The State of Georgia then appealed, and the Supreme Court of the United States granted &quot;certiorari&quot; on November 4, 1985, to review the case.

Hardwick was represented before the Supreme Court by Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe. Michael Hobbs, assistant attorney general, argued the case for the state. The legality of the officer&#x27;s entry into Hardwick&#x27;s home was not contested; only the constitutionality of the sodomy statute was challenged.

A heterosexual married couple was initially named in the suit as plaintiffs John and Mary Doe, alleging that they wished to engage in sodomy but were prevented from doing so by the Georgia anti-sodomy law. They failed to obtain standing and were dropped from the suit.

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court issued a 5–4 ruling upholding the sodomy laws. Justice Byron White wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Justices William Rehnquist, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Warren E. Burger, and Lewis F. Powell. Justice Harry Blackmun wrote a dissent joined by William J. Brennan, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, and John Paul Stevens. Stevens also wrote a dissent joined by Brennan and Marshall.

===Majority opinion===
The issue in &quot;Bowers&quot; involved the right of privacy. Since 1965&#x27;s &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, the Court had held that a right to privacy was implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In &quot;Bowers&quot;, the Court held that this right did not extend to private, consensual sexual conduct, at least insofar as it involved homosexual sex. The majority opinion in &quot;Bowers&quot;, written by Justice Byron White, framed the legal question as to whether the Constitution confers &quot;a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy.&quot; The opinion answered this question in the negative, stating that &quot;to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is &#x27;deeply rooted in this Nation&#x27;s history and tradition&#x27; or &#x27;implicit in the concept of ordered liberty is, at best, facetious.&quot;

Justice White added a slippery slope warning about undesirable potential implications for other sex laws:
===Chief Justice Burger&#x27;s concurrence===
The short concurring opinion by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger emphasized historical negative attitudes toward homosexual sex, quoting Sir William Blackstone&#x27;s characterization of sodomy as &quot;a crime not fit to be named&quot; and an offense of &quot;deeper malignity&quot; than rape. Burger concluded, &quot;To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.&quot;

===Justice Powell&#x27;s concurrence===
In a concurring opinion, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. joined the majority opinion in upholding the law against a substantive due process attack. He voiced doubts about the compatibility of Georgia&#x27;s law with the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, noting that even consensual sodomy could be punished with up to twenty years in prison, the same sentence as an aggravated battery or first-degree arson. Since Hardwick had not been tried or sentenced, the question of the statute&#x27;s constitutionality under the Eighth Amendment did not come up in the case.

Powell was considered the deciding vote during the case. He had initially voted to strike down the law but changed his mind after conservative clerk Michael W. Mosman advised him to uphold the ban. It has been claimed that Powell&#x27;s decision to uphold the law was influenced by his belief that he had never known any homosexuals, even though one of his own law clerks was gay. That clerk said Powell had met his boyfriend and asked him about the mechanisms of homosexual sex when deciding the case. He felt that Powell had made the remark in order to avoid revealing that one of his clerks was gay at a time when such a revelation could have destroyed that clerk&#x27;s future legal career. Journalists have since found that Powell hired more gay law clerks than any of the other justices.

===Dissents===

====Justice Blackmun&#x27;s dissent====
A sharply worded dissenting opinion by Justice Harry Blackmun attacked the majority opinion as having an &quot;almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity&quot;. Blackmun wrote, &quot;Only the most willful blindness could obscure the fact that sexual intimacy is &#x27;a sensitive, key relationship of human existence, central to family life, community welfare, and the development of human personality, quoting from Burger&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton&quot;, which held that obscene films are not constitutionally protected. The dissent compared the majority opinion to that in &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot;, which was reversed by the Court after only three years. At the conclusion of his opinion, Blackmun wrote simply &quot;I dissent,&quot; rather than the customary &quot;I respectfully dissent.&quot;

Blackmun revealed in a 1995 oral history with Harold Koh that his dissent in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; was written primarily by Blackmun&#x27;s openly gay clerk Pamela S. Karlan. Blackmun said of the dissent, &quot;Karlan did a lot of very effective writing, and I owe a lot to her and her ability in getting that dissent out. She felt very strongly about it, and I think is correct in her approach to it. I think the dissent is correct.&quot;

====Justice Stevens&#x27;s dissent====
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a separate dissent that focused on the selective enforcement of the law against homosexuals. The Georgia statute could not be applied to married heterosexuals, as consensual sexual activity within the bounds of marriage was protected under &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, nor could the law be applied to unmarried heterosexuals, as &quot;Eisenstadt v. Baird&quot; had extended &quot;Griswold&quot; to unmarried people. Since heterosexuals could never be prosecuted for sodomy, Georgia should have the burden of proving that selective enforcement against homosexuals was constitutional.

====Subsequent findings====
According to Daniel Richman, former law clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall, Marshall&#x27;s friendship with civil rights leader Bayard Rustin and Rustin&#x27;s openness about his homosexuality played a significant role in Marshall&#x27;s decision to join both dissents. Richman also recalled that Marshall thought that the case was a &quot;no-brainer&quot;, and told Richman, who wrote a bench memo for Marshall on the case, that &quot;this [case] is controlled by &quot;Stanley&quot;&quot;. 

Warren Burger&#x27;s views on homosexuality have come under scrutiny. He attempted to convince Byron White to include overtly homophobic language in the majority, which White refused to do. Burger lobbied Powell to change his mind, and sent him a note comparing homosexuals to Jack the Ripper.

==Subsequent events==

===Michael Hardwick===
Hardwick died in 1991 of complications from AIDS. According to his lawyer Kathleen Wilde, he died very bitter about the outcome of the case.

===Jurisprudence===
&quot;Bowers&quot; was decided at a time when the court&#x27;s privacy jurisprudence, and in particular the right to abortion recognized in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; had come under heavy criticism. &quot;Bowers&quot; signaled a reluctance by the Court to recognize a general constitutional right to privacy or to extend such a right further than they already had.

The Georgia law upheld in &quot;Bowers&quot; criminalized oral sex and anal sex whether engaged in by people of the same sex or different sexes, but White&#x27;s decision was restricted to homosexual sex. &quot;The only claim properly before the Court, therefore, is Hardwick&#x27;s challenge to the Georgia statute as applied to consensual homosexual sodomy. We express no opinion on the constitutionality of the Georgia statute as applied to other acts of sodomy.&quot; State sodomy laws were seldom enforced against private, consensual conduct in the decades following the decision, though many courts and state governments interpreted it to justify a wide variety of bans and limitations on the lives of gay people.

&quot;Bowers&quot; was used to deny suspect class qualification to gays and lesbians, thus restricting the standard of review to rational basis. Although &quot;Bowers&quot; was later overruled, decisions based on it, such as &quot;High Tech Gays v. Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office&quot;, are sometimes still cited as precedent in gay rights cases.

===Justice Powell&#x27;s later comments===
In 1990, three years after retiring from the Court, Powell told a group of New York University law students that he considered his opinion in &quot;Bowers&quot; an error, saying, &quot;I do think it was inconsistent in a general way with &quot;Roe&quot;. When I had the opportunity to reread the opinions a few months later I thought the dissent had the better of the arguments.&quot; Powell believed the case was one of little importance, and in 1990 said he had not devoted thirty minutes to think about it since the ruling.

===Repeal of state sodomy laws===
In the years after &quot;Bowers&quot; was decided, several state legislatures repealed their sodomy laws. In addition, a number of state courts invalidated sodomy laws under privacy or other provisions of their state constitutions. In 1998, the same sodomy law that was upheld in &quot;Bowers&quot; was struck down by the Georgia Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Powell v. State&quot;.

====&quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;====
In 2003, the remaining sodomy laws in 13 states were invalidated, insofar as they applied to private consensual conduct among adults, by the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, which explicitly overturned &quot;Bowers&quot;. In &quot;Lawrence&quot;, the Supreme Court subsequently based its decision on the American tradition of non-interference with private sexual decisions between consenting adults and on the notions of personal autonomy to define one&#x27;s own relationships. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Lawrence&quot;, ruling that Texas&#x27;s state sodomy law was unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s due process clause (adult consensual sexual intimacy in one&#x27;s home is a vital interest in liberty and privacy protected by the Due Process Clause). Kennedy wrote: &quot;&quot;Bowers&quot; was not correct when it was decided, and it is not correct today. It ought not to remain binding precedent. &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; should be and now is overruled.&quot; 

===Media portrayal===
Bill Moyers discussed the decision at length in an interview with Blackmun on the episode &quot;Mr. Justice Blackmun&quot; of the 1987 Constitutional bicentennial documentary miniseries &quot;In Search of the Constitution&quot;, and with Hardwick personally in a further episode &quot;For the People&quot;.

In 2009 a play based on the life of Michael Hardwick and the judicial proceedings, &quot;Sodomy Rules: The Bowers v. Hardwick Trial&quot;, was written and performed by Bill Crouch in New York City.

In 2019, an updated revision of &quot;Sodomy Rules! (The Bowers v. Hardwick Trial)&quot;, a solo documentary play based on the life of Michael Hardwick, was written and performed by Bill Crouch in New York City at The New Work Series presented by Emerging Artists on October 7, 2019.

===In popular culture===
The last name of the satirical character Betty Bowers, played by Deven Green, is taken from this case.

In the movie &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot;, there is a scene of a classroom in Tulane University in which the instructor and students discuss this case, with Julia Roberts&#x27; character, Darby Shaw, saying that the Court&#x27;s decision was wrong.

<doc id="286405" wikidata="Q325187" url="?curid=286405" title="Mortain">
<text>Mortain () is a former commune in the Manche department in Normandy in north-western France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Mortain-Bocage.

==Geography==
Mortain is situated on a rocky hill rising above the gorge of the Cance, a tributary of the Sélune.

==Administration==
Mortain is the seat of the canton of Le Mortainais. It is a former subprefecture of the Manche department and the seat of the former arrondissement of Mortain, which existed from 1800 to 1926.

==History==

In the Middle Ages Mortain was the head of an important county (&quot;comté&quot;), reserved for the reigning house of Normandy. Around 1027 it was established for Robert, who was probably an illegitimate son of Richard I of Normandy. He was succeeded by William Warlenc (&quot;the waning&quot;) who was probably his son. In or about 1049 Duke William took it from William Warlenc and bestowed it on his half-brother, Robert, thenceforth known as &quot;count of Mortain,&quot; whose vast possessions in England after the Conquest (1066) gave name to &quot;the small fees of Mortain,&quot; which owed less feudal service than others. Robert was succeeded as count by his son William, Count of Mortain, who rebelled against Henry I, was captured at the battle of Tinchebrai (1106) and forfeited his possessions. Some years later, Henry bestowed the comtéship on his nephew Stephen, who became king in 1135. On Stephen&#x27;s death (1154) his surviving son William became count of Mortain, but when William died childless in 1159 the title was resumed by Henry II. On the accession of Richard I (1189) he granted it to his brother John, who was thenceforth known as count of Mortain until he ascended the throne (1199). With his loss of Normandy the &quot;comté&quot; was lost, but after the recapture of the province by the House of Lancaster, Edmund Beaufort, a grandson of John of Gaunt, was created count of Mortain and so styled till 1441, when he was made earl of Dorset.

In August 1944, Mortain was the site of an important battle between the German and American forces. Over a period of six nights the 30th Infantry Division fought (with one radio with dying batteries) against the German Panzer counter-attack of Operation Lüttich, to preserve the breakout established in Operation Cobra. The defence failed and the Germans recaptured the town but could not hold it owing to developments along the front. The famed American author J.D. Salinger, who wrote &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, fought alongside the American forces, an experience that his daughter claims led to his post-traumatic syndrome.

===Heraldry===
==Sights==
The parish church of St Evroult is a magnificent example of the transitional style of the early 13th century. Close to the town is the Abbaye Blanche, founded as a Benedictine convent in 1105 and soon afterwards affiliated to Cîteaux. The church is a perfect example of a Cistercian monastic church of the late 12th century, and portions of the 12th-century cloisters also survive. The ruins of a castle was once the home of the cruel Sir Guillaume de Mortain and the site of the Gap of Goeblin.

==Notable people==
Mortain was the birthplace of Ferdinand André Fouqué (1828–1904), geologist and petrologist.

Émigrés from Mortain are remembered in the name of the village of Marston Moretaine in England.

==International relations==
Mortain is twinned with:

* Blandford Forum, United Kingdom
* Thannhausen, Germany

==External sources==
* World War II Germain Mortaine offensive

<doc id="286406" wikidata="Q25440" url="?curid=286406" title="Great cormorant">
<text>The great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), known as the black shag or kawau in New Zealand, formerly also known as the great black cormorant across the Northern Hemisphere, the black cormorant in Australia, and the large cormorant in India, is a widespread member of the cormorant family of seabirds. It breeds in much of the Old World, Australasia, and the Atlantic coast of North America.

==Taxonomy==
The great cormorant was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Pelecanus carbo&quot;. The great cormorant is now one of 12 species placed in the genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The genus name is Latinised Ancient Greek, from φαλακρός (&quot;phalakros&quot;, &quot;bald&quot;) and κόραξ (&quot;korax&quot;, &quot;raven&quot;); the specific epithet &quot;carbo&quot; is Latin for &quot;charcoal&quot;.

Five subspecies are accepted. These are listed below with their breeding ranges. Two additional species are very closely related, with genetic evidence suggesting they may be embedded within &quot;P. carbo&quot;; they are shown in the list below for completeness.

==Description==
The great cormorant is a large black bird, but there is a wide variation in size in the species&#x27; wide range. Weight is reported to vary from to . Males are typically larger and heavier than females, with the nominate race &quot;P. c. carbo&quot; averaging about 10% larger in linear measurements than the smaller subspecies &quot;P. c. sinensis&quot;. The lightest average weights cited are in Germany (&quot;P. c. sinensis&quot;), where 36 males averaged and 17 females averaged . The highest come from Prince Edward Island in Canada (&quot;P. c. carbo&quot;), where 11 males averaged and 11 females averaged . Length can vary from and wingspan from . They are tied as the second largest extant species of cormorant after the flightless cormorant, with the Japanese cormorant averaging at a similar size. In bulk if not in linear dimensions, the blue-eyed shag species complex of the Southern Oceans are scarcely smaller at average. It has a longish tail and yellow throat-patch. Adults have white filoplume patches on the thighs and on the head and upper neck in the breeding season. In European waters it can be distinguished from the common shag by its larger size, heavier build, thicker bill, lack of a crest and plumage without any green tinge. In eastern North America, it is similarly larger and bulkier than the double-crested cormorant; the latter species also has more yellow on the throat and bill and lacks the white thigh patches frequently seen on great cormorants. Great cormorants are mostly silent, but they make various guttural noises at their breeding colonies.

===Variations===
The white filoplumes on the head in the breeding season vary with both the age of the bird, and the subspecies; older birds have more white filoplumes than younger birds, while nominate &quot;P. c. carbo&quot; tends to have fewer than &quot;P. c. sinensis&quot;, but there is much overlap. The extent of variation between individuals means it is not a very useful character for subspecies identification.

A very rare variation of the great cormorant is caused by albinism. Albinos suffer from poor eyesight and/or hearing, thus it rarely manages to survive in the wild.

==Distribution==
This is a very common and widespread bird species. It feeds on the sea, in estuaries, and on freshwater lakes and rivers. Northern birds migrate south and winter along any coast that is well-supplied with fish.

In Serbia, the cormorant lives in Vojvodina. However, after 1945 many artificial lakes were formed in Serbia; some of them became potential habitats for cormorants. Currently, on the Lake Ćelije, formed in 1980, there is a resident colony of cormorants, who nest there and are present throughout the year, except January–February 1985 and February 2012 when the lake surface was completely frozen.

The type subspecies, &quot;P. c. carbo&quot;, is found mainly in Atlantic waters and nearby inland areas: on western European coasts and east across the Palearctic to Siberia and to North Africa, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland; and on the eastern seaboard of North America. The subspecies &quot;P. c. novaehollandiae&quot; is found in Australian waters.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
The great cormorant often nests in colonies near wetlands, rivers, and sheltered inshore waters. Pairs will use the same nest site to breed year after year. It builds its nest, which is made from sticks, in trees, on the ledges of cliffs, and on the ground on rocky islands that are free of predators.

This cormorant lays a clutch of three to five eggs that measure on average. The eggs are a pale blue or green, and sometimes have a white chalky layer covering them. These eggs are incubated for a period of about 28 to 31 days.

===Food and feeding===
The great cormorant feeds on fish caught through diving. This bird feeds primarily on wrasses, but it also takes sand smelt, flathead and common soles. The average weight of fish taken by great cormorants increases with decreasing air and water temperature. Cormorants consume all fish of appropriate size that they are able to catch in summer and noticeably select for larger, mostly torpedo-shaped fish in winter. Thus, the winter elevation of foraging efficiency described for cormorants by various researchers is due to capturing larger fish not due to capturing more fish. In some freshwater systems, the losses of fish due to overwintering great cormorants were estimated to be up to 80 kg per ha each year (e.g. Vltava River, Czech Republic).

This cormorant forages by diving and capturing its prey in its beak. The duration of its dives is around 28 seconds, with the bird diving to depths of about . About 60% of dives are to the benthic zone and about 10% are to the pelagic zone, with the rest of the dives being to zones in between the two. Studies suggest that their hearing has evolved for underwater usage, possibly aiding their detection of fish. These adaptations also have a cost on their hearing ability in air which is of lowered sensitivity.

==Relationships with humans==
Many fishermen see in the great cormorant a competitor for fish. Because of this, it was hunted nearly to extinction in the past. Due to conservation efforts, its numbers increased. At the moment, there are about 1.2 million birds in Europe (based on winter counts; late summer counts would show higher numbers). Increasing populations have once again brought the cormorant into conflict with fisheries. For example, in Britain, where inland breeding was once uncommon, there are now increasing numbers of birds breeding inland, and many inland fish farms and fisheries now claim to be suffering high losses due to these birds. In the UK each year, some licences are issued to cull specified numbers of cormorants in order to help reduce predation; it is, however, still illegal to kill a bird without such a licence.

Cormorant fishing is practised in China, Japan, and elsewhere around the globe. In this practice, fishermen tie a line around the throats of cormorants, tight enough to prevent swallowing the larger fish they catch, and deploy them from small boats. The cormorants catch fish without being able to fully swallow them, and the fishermen are able to retrieve the fish simply by forcing open the cormorants&#x27; mouths, apparently engaging the regurgitation reflex. To encourage its cooperation, the fisherman would reward the cormorant by letting it keep every eighth fish. The cormorants would eventually recognise this pattern and refuse to perform the eighth dive unless the fishing line was untied, and if the reward fish was not provided it would refuse to dive altogether. 

In Norway, the cormorant is a traditional game bird. Each year approximately 10,000 cormorants are shot to be eaten. In North Norway, cormorants are traditionally seen as semi-sacred. It is regarded as good luck to have cormorants gather near your village or settlement. An old legend states that people who die far out at sea, whose bodies are never recovered, spend eternity on the island Utrøst – which can only occasionally be found by mortals. The inhabitants of Utrøst can only visit their homes in the shape of cormorants.

<text>Anner Bylsma (born Anne Bijlsma; 17 February 1934 – 25 July 2019) was a Dutch cellist who played on both modern and period instruments in a historically informed style. He took an interest in music from an early age. He studied with Carel van Leeuwen Boomkamp at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague and won the &quot;Prix d&#x27;excellence&quot; in 1957.

In 1959, he won the first prize in the Pablo Casals Competition in Mexico. By 1961, he was using a new spelling of his first and last names for recordings and performances at the suggestion of his manager. For six years, from 1962 to 1968, he was the principal cellist of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. He became an Erasmus Scholar at Harvard University in 1982. He was the author of the book &quot;Bach, the Fencing Master&quot;, a stylistic and aesthetic analysis of Bach&#x27;s cello suites. He was one of the pioneers of the &quot;Dutch Baroque School&quot; and rose to fame as a partner of Frans Brüggen and Gustav Leonhardt, who toured extensively together and made many recordings. Bylsma continued to be a towering figure in the baroque cello movement.

In 1979, Bylsma recorded the six suites for unaccompanied cello (BWV 1007–1012) by J. S. Bach, the first of its kind on a period instrument. He later went on to recreate the same music in 1992 on the large Servais Stradivarius and on a five-string violoncello piccolo.

Bylsma was married to the Dutch violinist Vera Beths (mother of Dutch actress Katja Herbers). He had a son and a daughter, documentary filmmaker Carine Bijlsma.

<doc id="286411" wikidata="Q3073271" url="?curid=286411" title="Flamborough Head">
<text>Flamborough Head () is a promontory, long on the Yorkshire coast of England, between the Filey and Bridlington bays of the North Sea. It is a chalk headland, with sheer white cliffs. The cliff top has two standing lighthouse towers, the oldest dating from 1669 and Flamborough Head Lighthouse built in 1806. The older lighthouse was designated a Grade II* listed building in 1952 and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England.
The cliffs provide nesting sites for many thousands of seabirds, and are of international significance for their geology.

==Special Area of Conservation==
Flamborough Head has been designated a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) by the British Government&#x27;s Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). (Special Areas of Conservation are strictly protected sites designated under the European Community Habitats Directive, which requires the establishment of a European network of important high-quality conservation sites to make a significant contribution to conserving the 189 habitat types and 788 species identified in Annexes to this Directive.) Flamborough Outer Headland is an Local Nature Reserve. Yorkshire Wildlife Trust manages the Flamborough Cliffs Nature Reserve, located on the headland.

==Site of Special Scientific Interest==
The cliffs at Flamborough Head are designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for both geological and biological significance. First designated in 1952, the SSSI area extends from Sewerby round the headland to Reighton Sands. The estimated 200,000 nesting seabirds, including one of only two mainland British gannetries, are the most notable biological feature.

===Geology===
The headland is the only chalk sea cliff in the north. The coastline within the SSSI has strata from the upper Jurassic through to top of the Cretaceous period, and the headland exhibits a complete sequence of Chalk Group North Sea Basin strata, dated from 100 to 70 million years ago. The various chalk deposits are known as the Ferriby, Welton, Burnham and Flamborough Chalk. The dramatic white cliffs contrast with the low coast of Holderness to the south, where the chalk is deeply buried and the glacial boulder clay above erodes very readily. The chalk cliffs have a larger number and a wider range of cave habitats at Flamborough than at any other chalk site in Britain, the largest of which are known to extend for more than 50 metres from their entrance on the coast. There are also stacks, natural arches and blowholes. The site is identified as being of international importance in the Geological Conservation Review.

===Birds===

Seabirds such as northern gannets, kittiwakes and Atlantic puffins breed abundantly on the cliffs. Bempton Cliffs, on the north side of the headland, has an RSPB reserve and visitor centre.

The shooting of seabirds at Flamborough Head was condemned by Professor Alfred Newton in his 1868 speech to the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Local MP Christopher Sykes introduced the Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869, the first Act to protect wild birds in the United Kingdom. Shooting continued, with an 1886 edition of &quot;The Cornishman&quot; newspaper reporting the enormous flocks of sea birds are affording sport, with the fisherman killing the birds for selling to taxidermists; two boatmen were bagging a hundred birds daily.

Because it projects into the sea, Flamborough Head attracts many migrant birds in autumn, and is a key point for observing passing seabirds. When the wind is in the east, many birders watch for seabirds from below the lighthouse, or later in the autumn comb the hedges and valleys for landbird migrants. Flamborough Head has a bird observatory.

==Battle of Flamborough Head 1779==
A Franco-American squadron fought the Battle of Flamborough Head with a pair of Royal Navy frigates in the American War of Independence on 23 September 1779. In the engagement, USS &quot;Bonhomme Richard&quot; and &quot;Pallas&quot;, with , captured and HM hired armed ship , the best-known incident of Captain John Paul Jones&#x27;s naval career. The toposcope at the lighthouse commemorates the 180th (1959) anniversary of the battle.

==Associated places==
===Danes Dyke===
Danes Dyke is a long ditch that runs north to south isolating the seaward of the headland. The dyke and the steep cliffs make the enclosed territory and its two boat launching beaches, North and South Landings, easily defended. Despite its name, the dyke is prehistoric in origin, and Bronze Age arrowheads were found when it was excavated by Pitt-Rivers in 1879. It is a Local Nature Reserve.

===Thornwick Bay===
On the north side of Flamborough Head lies Thornwick Bay, a bay with a rock beach surrounded by cliffs. The second part of the name &quot;Thornwick&quot; comes from the Old Norse word &quot;vík&quot; (&#x27;bay&#x27;) (meaning that the modern name &quot;Thornwick Bay&quot; is tautologous). At the north side of the bay lies Thornwick Nebb, the final part of which comes from Old Norse &quot;neb&quot; (&#x27;promontory&#x27;).

A plaque at Thornwick Bay commemorates the 1952 loss of Robert Redhead, the bowman of the Bridlington lifeboat, while attempting to rescue two girls, Joan Ellis and Gillian Fox, from drowning.

==Cultural references==
Flamborough Head and the village of Flamborough are the setting for the book &quot;Bill Takes the Helm&quot; by Betty Bowen. In the book an American boy struggles to save his grandmother&#x27;s house – in which he, his sister and grandmother are living – from destruction by the sea. He is also desperately trying to get used to England after the death of his mother, who requested in her will that he be sent there.

Flamborough Head was featured on the television programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the wonders of Yorkshire and briefly in the first series of &quot;Coast&quot;.

Flamborough Head was featured in the finale of series 3 of the ITV drama &quot;Scott &amp; Bailey&quot;.

North Landing beach was used as a film location for the 2016 re-make of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;.

==Lightning strike==
During the evening of 23 August 2006, a lightning bolt hit a buttress on the cliffs, sending 100 tonnes of rock into the sea.

<doc id="286413" wikidata="Q708492" url="?curid=286413" title="Councillor">
<text>A councillor, alternatively councilman, councilwoman, councilperson, or council member, is someone who sits on, votes in, or is a member of, a council. This is typically an elected representative of an electoral district in a municipal or regional government, or other local authority. The title of a councillor varies geographically, with a name generally being preceded by their title (or the shortened version Cllr when written) in formal or council-related situations in many places.

== Canada ==

Due to the control that the provinces have over their municipal governments, terms that councillors serve vary from province to province. Unlike most provincial elections, municipal elections are usually held on a fixed date of 4 years.

==Finland==
&quot;This is about honorary rank, not elected officials.&quot;

In Finland councillor (&quot;neuvos&quot;) is the highest possible title of honour which can be granted by the President of Finland. There are several ranks of councillors and they have existed since the Russian Rule. Some examples of different councillors in Finland are as follows:

*Councillor of State: the highest class of the titles of honour; granted to successful 
*Mining Councillor/Trade Councillor/Industry Councillor/Economy Councillor: granted to leading industry figures in different fields of the economy
*Councillor of Parliament: granted to successful statesmen
*Office Councillor: granted to leading university figures
*Councillor of Culture/Theatre Councillor/Film Councillor: granted to leading cultural figures
*Chamber Councillor: granted for successful officials in the field of local government

==India==
As per the Seventy-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India, municipal governance in India is looked after by elected councillors who are members of either a municipal corporation (for cities) or a municipality (for towns).

==The Philippines==
Under the Philippine Republic Act No. 7160 (otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991), a councilor is a member of a local council that is the legislative body of the local government unit. They are commonly referred to as &quot;Sanggunian Member&quot; because the official designation of municipal, city and provincial councils is the equivalent term in Filipino (used even when speaking or writing in English): Sanggunian Bayan, Sanggunian Panglunsod and Sanggunian Panlalawigan, respectively.

==United Kingdom==
All local authorities in the United Kingdom are overseen by elected councillors. These include:

#unitary authorities
#county councils and district councils
#parish, town and community councils
#The Common Council of the City of London (in which councillors are known as aldermen and councilmen)

According to &quot;Debrett&#x27;s Correct Form&quot; the English title &quot;Councillor&quot; (often shortened to &#x27;Cllr&#x27;) applies only to elected members of city, borough or district councils. However, there is no legal basis for this restriction and in practice the title is applied to all councillors at all levels of local government. Where necessary, parish and county councillors are differentiated by the use of a fuller title such as &quot;town councillor&quot; or &quot;county councillor&quot;. The title precedes the holder&#x27;s rank or other title, as in Cllr Dr Jenny Smith or Cllr Sir Ricky Taing, and for women it precedes their title of marital status, as in Cllr Mrs Joan Smith.

Councillors are typically elected as members of political parties or alternatively as independents. Councils may also co-opt unelected councillors to fill vacancies on a council where insufficient candidates have stood for election, although in practice this is rare outside parish councils. They are bound by a code of conduct enforced by standards boards.

In 2007 the Electoral Administration Act 2006 reduced the age limit for councillors to 18, leading to younger people standing.
===Youth Councillors===
Youth Councillors are also elected in local areas by organisations that are members of the British Youth Council, such as Salford Youth Council.

===Remuneration===

Most councillors are not full-time professionals.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland most larger borough, unitary authority or county councils do pay them basic allowances and out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, special responsibility allowances are paid to councillors who carry out more senior duties. The basic allowances and special responsibility allowances are theoretically paid to compensate councillors for time spent on council duties and are classed as salaries for tax purposes. Parish, town or community councillors may, since the Local Government Act 2000, be paid for their services.

In Scotland, since 2007, councillors have received a salary of £15,000, as opposed to a series of allowances. This rises annually and as of 1 April 2023 councillor pay in Scotland stands at £20,099 per annum. These are often topped up by special responsibility allowances.

===Regional government===

The London Assembly is regarded not as a local authority but as a regional devolved assembly and its members are referred to as Assembly Members, not councillors.

==United States==
Council member, councilman/councilwoman, councilor, or councillor is a title for a member of a council used in the United States.

In particular, the title is used in the following cases:
*City councils or town councils that do not use the title of alderman
*Council of the District of Columbia
==British Commonwealth==

In Australia, The Bahamas, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Botswana, Trinidad and Tobago and other parts of the Commonwealth, as well as Ireland, a councillor or councilor is an elected representative on a local government council.

==Netherlands==
In the Netherlands, a member of the municipal council is called a &quot;gemeenteraadslid&quot; or &quot;raadslid&quot;. Someone out of this group who is elected to serve on the municipal executive is called a &quot;wethouder&quot;, which is usually translated as &#x27;alderman&#x27; or &#x27;councillor&#x27;. The Dutch word for mayor is &quot;burgemeester&quot;. This is expressed in English as &quot;mayor&quot; or &quot;burgomaster&quot;. The municipal executive is referred to collectively as the &quot;College van Burgemeester en Wethouders&quot;.
==Belgium==
In Belgium, a member of the municipal council is called a &quot;gemeenteraadslid&quot; in Dutch, and &quot;Conseiller Communal&quot; in French. Someone out of this group who is elected to serve on the municipal executive is called a &quot;schepen&quot; in Dutch or &quot;échevin&quot; in French. This is usually translated as &quot;alderman&quot; or &quot;councillor&quot; in English. The municipal executive is referred to collectively as the &quot;College van Burgemeester en Schepenen&quot; ou &quot;Collège du Bourgmestre et Echevins&quot;.

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, a member of the city council is called a &quot;Councillor&quot;. The Councillor of Bangladesh is a city corporation&#x27;s ward representatives who are elected City Corporations election by popular vote in every five years. Councilors carry out the developmental works of their elected wards and perform the functions of local government act and assist the City Mayor in all works under the City Corporation and carry out his orders.

==Luxembourg==

==Norway==
In Norway, a member of the municipal council, &quot;kommunestyret&quot;, is called a &quot;kommunestyrerepresentant&quot; in Norwegian. The Norwegian word for mayor is &quot;ordfører&quot;.
==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, members of district councils are also referred to as councillors. Before 1999 the district councils were known as district boards, upon the abolition of the municipal councils (the UrbCo and the RegCo) in December that year. In addition, members of the legislative council are also referred to as councillors. From 1996 to 1998 the Legislative Council were known as &quot;Provisional Legislative Council&quot;, upon the abolition of the interim legislature in July 1998.

<doc id="286425" wikidata="Q1832296" url="?curid=286425" title="Lajas, Puerto Rico">
<text>Lajas () is a town and municipality of Puerto Rico located in the Lajas Valley in southwestern Puerto Rico, on the southern coast of the island, bordering the Caribbean Sea, south of San Germán and Sabana Grande; east of Cabo Rojo; and west of Guánica. Lajas is spread over 11 barrios plus Lajas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Germán-Cabo Rojo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Located in the Lajas Valley, the town was founded in 1883 by the Xueta Teodoro Jácome Pagán. Xuetes (Chuetas) were Majorcan Jews (Sephardic Catalan Jews). Some families changed their names from &quot;Jácome&quot; to the Castilian form Santiago. Jácome is the Mallorquin form of James (Ia&#x27;akov). Catalan Jews from Majorca were part of the early settlers in the south of Borikén (Puerto Rico).

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a colony of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Lajas was 8,789.

The village of La Parguera is a popular tourist destination to see the famous Bahía Fosforescente (Phosphorescent Bay) and its numerous keys and islets. Parador La Parguera was founded by Puerto Rican comedian Henry LaFont (Julio Pancorbo Ortiz).

People from the El Combate community in barrio Boquerón are known as &quot;mata con hacha&quot; (&quot;those who kill with axes&quot;) based on folklore about a fight over the &quot;salinas&quot;, where those from Cabo Rojo fought with axes against people from the adjacent town of Lajas. Because the people from Lajas apparently fought back by throwing stones they are known as &quot;tira piedras&quot; (&quot;those who throw stones&quot;).

On September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. In Lajas, over 270 residences lost their roofs. The hurricane destroyed Lajas&#x27; pineapple industry.

==Symbols==
Lajas or Municipality has an official flag and coat of arms.

===Flag===
The flag consists of three horizontal stripes; the top one is green, the center one is white and the bottom one is light yellow. A vertical white stripe down the left makes a white cross. In the center of the cross is a ripe yellow pineapple. The cross is surrounded by eleven gold stars; five in the top part and six in the lower part of the cross, in the form of a circle.

===Coat of arms===
It is gold with a green band crossing it diagonally right to left; gold stands for the wealth of the land and green for the beauty of the valley, which is a gift from mother nature to Lajas. The band is adorned, at each end, with a pineapple bordered in gold and black. In the center of the band, also in gold, a marine shell. In the top left there is a red cardinal&#x27;s hat and in the bottom a red anchor with green; the shield has a 3 tower castle, each one with two windows and a door. On the bottom, outside the shield, a banner with the inscription &quot;Ciudad Cardenalicia&quot; (Cardinal City). This, for Cardinal Luis Aponte Martínez, born in Lajas, who was the first and only Cardinal of the Catholic Church from Puerto Rico. The banner and the inscription appear in black.

<doc id="286426" wikidata="Q536126" url="?curid=286426" title="Julian Jackson (boxer)">
<text>Julian Jackson (born September 12, 1960) is a former professional boxer from the U.S. Virgin Islands who competed from 1981 to 1998. He is a three-time world champion in two weight classes, having held the World Boxing Association (WBA) super welterweight title from 1987 to 1990, and the World Boxing Council (WBC) middleweight title twice between 1990 and 1995. Possessing formidable punching power, with a knockout-to-win rate of 89%, Jackson is regarded by many as one of the hardest punchers in boxing history, pound for pound, and was ranked number 25 by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine in a 2003 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Punchers&quot;. Jackson was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Amateur career==
Jackson represented the United States Virgin Islands at the 1979 Pan American Games, losing his first fight to Jose Baret of the Dominican Republic.

Jackson reportedly completed his amateur career with a record of 15 wins, 2 losses.

==Professional career==
Jackson turned professional in February 1981 and had many of his early fights in Puerto Rico, where he lived for a short time, and gained a shot at WBA super welterweight champion Mike McCallum in August 1986. Jackson hurt the champion on a couple occasions in the first round, but McCallum came storming back with a barrage that forced the referee to stop matters in the second round.

===Light middleweight Champion===
After McCallum moved up to middleweight, Jackson got his second shot at the now-vacant WBA title in November 1987 against Korean Baek In-chul, winning in three rounds. Baek would go on to win the WBA super-middleweight title a year later. Jackson made three defenses of his crown, against former IBF title-holder Buster Drayton (TKO 3), Francisco DeJesus (KO 8), and future three-time champion Terry Norris (TKO 2). All these defenses were won with a single knockout punch.

===First middleweight title reign===

Jackson then vacated his crown, moved up to 160 lb (73 kg), and was matched against Herol &#x27;Bomber&#x27; Graham for the vacant WBC middleweight title. Due to Jackson&#x27;s recent retina damage which had required surgery, the British Boxing Board of Control felt that Jackson was returning to boxing too soon and didn&#x27;t allow him to box in the UK, so the bout was held at Torrequebrada Hotel &amp; Casino, Benalmádena, Andalucía, Spain on 24 November 1990.

Graham was putting on his typical savvy performance against Jackson: countering, slipping, and dancing out of the way, targeting Jackson&#x27;s vulnerable eye which started to swell. After being consistently beaten to the punch for three and a half rounds, Jackson then unleashed one of the great right hands in boxing history. After Jackson connected with the punch, Graham was unconscious before he hit the canvas, and was revived only after five alarming minutes.

Defenses against Dennis Milton (KO 1), Ismael Negron (KO 1), and Ron Collins (TKO 5) ended quickly, but Thomas Tate would make Jackson work longer and harder in their August 1992 encounter – Julian had to go to the scorecards for the first time in a title bout in winning a 12-round unanimous decision, scoring a knockdown along the way. At this point Jackson was in the middle of the pound-for-pound rankings.

This would lead to his showdown in May 1993 with another big hitter, Gerald McClellan. This time the challenger prevailed, as Jackson failed to find the knockout blow when hitting McClellan with hard punches and controlling Rounds 2 and 3, with McClellan turning the fight around and knocking Jackson down twice in the fifth round. The second knockdown prompted the referee to stop the fight, after Jackson made it to his feet yet remained unsteady.

After winning his next three fights, Jackson had another shot at the title in May 1994 in a rematch with McClellan. In a very brief fight, Jackson hit McClellan with some hard punches, but Jackson was then hurt himself and put under heavy pressure by McClellan, with McClellan flooring Jackson with a left hook to the body after 65 seconds. The referee counted Jackson out as he rose to his feet.
===Second middleweight title reign===

After McClellan vacated the title to move up to super-middleweight, Jackson would have a second but brief reign as WBC middleweight champion, beating the previously undefeated European champion Agostino Cardamone in March 1995. Jackson had a shaky end to the first round, during which he was hurt and put under pressure until the bell by Cardamone, who wasn&#x27;t considered a hard puncher. In round two however, Jackson again showed his punching power by suddenly dropping Cardamone heavily with a short right hand. Cardamone managed to make it to his feet but remained badly shaken, forcing the referee to stop the fight.

Jackson lost the title in his first defense against Quincy Taylor in August 1995, by a sixth round stoppage. During the fight with Taylor, Jackson tore his rotator cuff and looked a shadow of his former self.

===Post title===
Jackson would have four more low-key victories, before ending his career with losses to Verno Phillips and Anthony Jones, both in nine rounds, in 1998.

He was inducted into the Atlantic City Boxing Hall of Fame in 2025.

==Life after boxing==
After retiring from the sport, Jackson joined the ministry and still lives in his birthplace of St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. He has continued his involvement in the local boxing field as a trainer and coach, and his three sons, Julius Jackson, Julian Jackson Jr. and John Jackson, have all competed professionally since 2009.

Jackson was once hired by Coral World Ocean Park in St. Thomas as a way to attract visitors to the park.

<text>The domain name .tv is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Tuvalu. The domain name is popular, and thus economically valuable, because TV also happens to be an abbreviation of the word &quot;television&quot;.

In 1998, the government of Tuvalu sought to capitalize on the .tv suffix, later signing with the International Telecommunication Union, Information.CA, Idealab, Verisign, and currently GoDaddy to expand the domain. Except for reserved names like com.tv, net.tv, org.tv and others, anyone may register second-level domains under .tv. By 2019, 8.4% of the revenue of the government of Tuvalu came from .tv royalties, with hundreds of thousands of websites registered under the domain. Google treats .tv as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) because &quot;users and website owners frequently see [the domain] as being more generic than country targeted.&quot;

== History ==

=== Background and creation ===
As a small country, Tuvalu gained a small amount of money. The government later found the .tv domain.

The domain was later issued by the government in the 80s. Following the implementation, the government of Tuvalu cooperated with the International Telecommunication Union to find a marketing partner for the domain. In 1998, the .tv Corporation was established as the exclusive .tv domain registrar under the management of Information.CA of Toronto, which agreed to pay US$50 million upfront to manage and market .tv registrations until 2048. Following delays in payment, in 1999, the contract was reassigned to the California-based Idealab, which agreed to pay $12.5 million of the $50 million upfront and the remainder in $1 million quarterly payments over a 10-year licensing contract. Following a $5 million quarterly payment in January 2000, the company&#x27;s subsequent poor financial performance resulted in the transfer of $3 million in preferred .tv stock to the government of Tuvalu in exchange for waiving three quarterly payments.

=== Marketing and use ===
On 31 December 2001, the company was acquired by Verisign for $45 million, including $10 million for Tuvalu&#x27;s $3 million stake in the company. Quarterly payments were renegotiated from $1 million to $550,000 and extended to last until 2011. On 19 March 2010, Verisign reduced .tv registration fees to encourage widespread adoption of the domain. In 2011, Verisign renewed its contract with the government of Tuvalu to manage .tv registrations through 2021.

In 2014, Amazon acquired Twitch for $1 billion, making it the first .tv website to achieve unicorn status. The government of Tuvalu subsequently renegotiated its contract with Verisign, resulting in an increase in yearly payments to Tuvalu around $5 million, a 1/12th of the nation&#x27;s annual gross national income (GNI) at the time. 

As Verisign opted not to renew its contract, on 14 December 2021, GoDaddy signed a contract with the government of Tuvalu to manage .tv registrations, increasing yearly payments to the government of Tuvalu to $10 million. In 2023, an agreement between the Government of Tuvalu and the GoDaddy Company outsourced the marketing, sales, promotion and branding of the .tv domain to the Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation, which established a .tv Unit.

== Benefits ==
In 2019, the island of Tuvalu gained an estimated $5.5 million from the domain, along with other business practices like fishing. Proceedings from .tv domain registrations are used to fund the Tuvaluan government&#x27;s Future Now Project (), which provides mitigation plans for infrastructure and maritime boundaries affected by climate change, digitization of cultural heritage and maintenance of the domain and related intellectual property&#x27;s active status.

==Content stations==

Websites with the .tv domain often feature video content for specific brands or firms. The domain contains the sites of news services, including Fox News and MSNBC. It also includes streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. The domain also contains the website Twitch, and the Eurovision Song Contest.

In July 2011, Google removed .co.tv websites from its search results due to their extensive use by website scammers. This had no impact on other .tv websites. According to Lucian Constantin at Softpedia, &quot;CO.TV is a free domain provider that is obviously being abused by the people behind this campaign. All of the rogue domains used are hosted on the same IP address.&quot;

==Climate change==
The island state of Tuvalu&#x27;s long-term habitability is threatened by climate change, with the island being barely above sea level. In response to the question of what would happen if a nation-state would cease to exist, the ICANN board stated: &quot;If the code element is removed, the ccTLD would be eligible for retirement. Reason for removal is not of relevance.&quot; This means that the top-level domain would be dissolved if the country were to disappear.

<text>In Malaysia, cities (Malay: &quot;bandaraya&quot;) are officially designated under the governance of city councils (Malay: &quot;Majlis bandaraya&quot;), although there are several exceptions. , 20 areas in the country are officially termed cities by law. Among them, 16 are from Peninsular Malaysia, while 3 are from East Malaysia. George Town, the capital city of Penang, was declared a city on 1 January 1957 by Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, making it the first city in the country, and the only city declared before Malayan independence. George Town remained the sole city of Malaya until 1963, when Singapore was formally incorporated into Malaysia. However, Singapore&#x27;s expulsion in 1965 meant that George Town would remain Malaysia&#x27;s only city until Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s declaration as a city in 1972, by Abdul Halim of Kedah, the fifth Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia. In 1988, Kuching was chartered as the first city in East Malaysia. Klang is the most recent municipality in the country declared a city, doing so on 5 February 2024.

There are also highly urbanised and populated areas across the country that did not attain city status, but are sometimes referred as cities. Officially, these areas are classified as municipalities or townships.

== Cities in Malaysia ==

=== Former cities ===
== History ==

===Penang===
George Town became a city on 1 January 1957 by a royal charter granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, becoming the first town in the Federation of Malaya to become a city (Singapore became a city in 1951). The royal charter stated that:&quot;... the said Municipality of George Town shall on the First Day of January in the year of Our Lord One thousand nine hundred and fifty-seven and forever after that be a city and shall be called and styled the CITY OF GEORGE TOWN instead of the Municipality of George Town and shall thenceforth have all such rank, liberties, privileges and immunities as are incident to a City.&quot;However, local government elections were abolished by the federal government in 1965, and the functions of the City Council were transferred to the Chief Minister of Penang in 1966. A Municipal Council for the whole of Penang Island, the Penang Island Municipal Council, was set up between 1974 and 1976.

Although the city status of George Town was never officially revoked, George Town&#x27;s existence as a corporate entity was in doubt, let alone as a city. This is similar to the position of the former city of Rochester in England, the site of England&#x27;s second-oldest cathedral, which had been a city from 1211 until 1998 when it was merged with a neighbouring borough. As the new council was not granted city status, and the city, through oversight, failed to appoint charter trustees to inherit the city charter, the city ceased to exist.

Most residents disagreed with this view and held that as George Town&#x27;s city status has never been revoked, it remains a city to this day. According to lawyer Datuk Anwar Fazal, George Town &quot;legally has been and is still a city because the City of George Town Ordinance 1957 had not been repealed&quot;.[3] As city status is a matter of law, the actual legal position will depend on an analysis of the City Council of Penang (Transfer of Functions) Order 1966 and the Local Government Act 1976.

On 1 January 2015, the Malaysian federal government upgraded the Penang Island Municipal Council into the present-day Penang Island City Council, thereby expanding the city limit of George Town to encompass the entirety of Penang Island, as well as a handful of surrounding islets.

===Subsequent cities===
The royal charters for Kuala Lumpur, Kuching, Kota Kinabalu, Shah Alam, Malacca City, Alor Setar and Miri were from the Malaysian head of state, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, while Ipoh, Johor Bahru, Iskandar Puteri and Subang Jaya were granted by their respective state sultans. Malacca City was declared a &quot;historical city&quot; prior to being granted city status in 2003.

Kuala Lumpur, the largest city, is the national capital and a federal territory, but as of 2012, most government ministries have relocated to the new administrative capital of Putrajaya.

===Criteria===
Local governments or local authorities in Malaysia (Malay: &quot;pihak berkuasa tempatan&quot;, abbreviated PBT) are placed under the jurisdiction of their respective state governments. On the other hand, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government (Malay: &quot;Kementerian Perumahan dan Kerajaan Tempatan&quot;, abbreviated as KPKT) handles the classification and standardisation of local governments while providing them with consultation services (&quot;i.e.&quot; technical consultancy and federal funding). For the Federal Territories, their respective local governments are monitored by the Ministry of Federal Territories and Urban Wellbeing (Malay: &quot;Kementerian Wilayah Persekutuan&quot;, abbreviated KWP). The National Council of Local Governments (Malay: &quot;Majlis Negara Kerajaan Tempatan&quot;, abbreviated as MNKT), formed in 1960 by the federal government, is tasked on handling policies and laws related to local governments.

KPKT formally classifies local governments in three different categories: city councils, municipal councils, and district councils, with exceptions equivalent to the three respective categories. These categories are separated by certain requirements related to urban population, finances, and infrastructural developments. The 60th meeting of the MNKT, held on 3 June 2008, approved updated criterion on the selection process for the granting of city status on a local government:

# The local government must administer a region that is an administrative centre of a state;
# The region must have a population of more than 500-thousand people;
# The local government must be financially sustainable, with an annual income of not less than 100-million ringgit, and has the ability to afford stable administrative expenditures;
# The local government must have an efficient bureaucratic structure, while maintaining public services at the highest-level, &quot;e.g.&quot; tax collection, development approvals, legal enforcement, and other necessary functions;
# Urban developments planned by the local government should be sustainable;
# The local government should give further emphasis on resolving social issues, &quot;i.e.&quot; squatting, pollution, safety, affordable housing, and environmental conservation. Studies conducted by the &quot;Malaysian Urban Indicators Network&quot; (MURNInet) would also be taken account of.
# The local government must promote an urban image that is applicable towards the national identity as a representation of the country&#x27;s heritage, and preserve any local objects or places of historical, cultural, or artistic significance;
# The region must contain adequate resources and institutions of finance and industry to easily facilitate trade and foreign investments;
# The region must be a local hub of education, complete with universities, colleges, museums and public libraries;
# The region must be a centre of culture, sports, and recreation;
# The local government should have the ability to host conventions of national and international level;
# The infrastructure of the region should be complete, with sufficient public utilities (&quot;e.g.&quot; disabled-persons friendly-public parks, public transportation, traffic management systems, road networks, computer services), and;
# The region must achieve nationwide or international recognition equivalent to those of other cities worldwide.

== Locations of cities ==
== Population ==
Kuala Lumpur is by far the largest urban area as well as the largest metropolitan area in Malaysia. George Town, the capital city of Penang, forms the core of the country&#x27;s second largest conurbation. To the south, Johor Bahru is the heart of Johor Bahru Conurbation, the nation&#x27;s third largest urban area. Other metropolitan areas with a population of more than 500,000 include Ipoh, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu.

<doc id="286436" wikidata="Q232885" url="?curid=286436" title="255 (number)">
<text>255 (two hundred [and] fifty-five) is the natural number following 254 and preceding 256.

==In mathematics==
Its factorization makes it a sphenic number. Since 255 = 28 – 1, it is a Mersenne number (though not a pernicious one), and the fourth such number not to be a prime number. It is a perfect totient number, the smallest such number to be neither a power of three nor thrice a prime.

Since 255 is the product of the first three Fermat primes, the regular 255-gon is constructible.

In base 10, it is a self number.

255 is a repdigit in base 2 (11111111), in base 4 (3333), and in base 16 (FF).

formula_1

==In computing==
255 is a special number in some tasks having to do with computing. This is the maximum value representable by an eight-digit binary number, and therefore the maximum representable by an unsigned 8-bit byte (the most common size of byte, also called an octet), the smallest common variable size used in high level programming languages (bit being smaller, but rarely used for value storage). The range is 0 to 255, which is 256 total values.

:formula_2

For example, 255 is the maximum value of
* components in the 24-bit RGB color model, since each color channel is allotted eight bits;
* any dotted quad in an IPv4 address; and
* the alpha blending scale in Delphi (255 being 100% visible and 0 being fully transparent) and
* a DMX512 channel

The use of eight bits for storage in older video games has had the consequence of it appearing as a hard limit in many video games. For example, in the original &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; game, Link can carry a maximum of 255 rupees. It was often used for numbers where casual gameplay would not cause anyone to exceed the number. However, in most situations it is reachable given enough time. This can cause many other peculiarities to appear when the number wraps back to 0, such as the infamous &quot;kill screen&quot; seen after clearing level 255 of Pac-Man.

This number could be interpreted by a computer as −1 if a programmer is not careful about which 8-bit values are signed and unsigned, and the two&#x27;s complement representation of −1 in a signed byte is equal to that of 255 in an unsigned byte.

<doc id="286439" wikidata="Q125469" url="?curid=286439" title="Ruhnama">
<text>The Ruhnama, or Rukhnama, translated into English as Book of the Soul, is a two volume work written by Saparmurat Niyazov, the president of Turkmenistan from 1990 to 2006. It was intended to serve as a tool of state propaganda, emphasising the basis of the Turkmen nation.

The &quot;Ruhnama&quot; was introduced to Turkmen culture in a gradual but eventually pervasive way. Niyazov first placed copies in the nation&#x27;s schools and libraries but eventually went as far as to make an exam on its teachings an element of the driving test. It was mandatory to read &quot;Ruhnama&quot; in schools, universities and governmental organisations. New governmental employees were tested on the book at job interviews.

After the death of Niyazov in December 2006, its popularity remained high. However, in the following years, its ubiquity had waned as President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow removed it from the public school curriculum and halted the practice of testing university applicants on their knowledge of the book.

== Background ==
Epics had played multiple important roles in the social life of Central Asia across centuries. Pre-modern rulers of these regions usually appropriated the text and invented a connection between themselves and the epic-cast, to seek legitimacy for their new order.

Stalin had considered these epics to be &quot;politically suspicious&quot; and capable of inciting nationalist feelings among the masses; almost all significant Turkmen epics were condemned and banned by 1951–52. These epics would be rehabilitated back into public (and academic) discourse only with the onset of Glasnost. Ruhnama built on this rehabilitation phase.

=== Production ===
Niyazov claimed to have received a prophetic vision where Turkmen ancestors of eminence urged him to lead Turkmens to the &quot;golden path of life&quot;. The first version was released in the 1990s but soon withdrawn because it did not fulfill Niyazov&#x27;s expectations. Preparations for the revised book were underway as early as April 1999, when Niyazov declared that &quot;Mukkadesh Ruhnama&quot; would be the second landmark text of Turkmens, after the Quran.

The first volume was finally published in December 2001. On 18 February 2001, it was accepted at the 10th joint meeting of the State Assembly of Elders of Turkmenistan, and National Assembly. In September 2004, Niyazov issued a second volume. An edited volume on the Ruhnama, published a year later, quotes his overall purpose to have lain in highlighting the nation&#x27;s significant contributions to fields of art and science.

Victoria Clement and Riccardo Nicolosi suspect that the work was ghost-written.

== Genre ==
Scholars note Ruhnama to be a &quot;mosaic&quot; of different literary genres, the text combines spiritual and political advice, legends, autobiography, short stories, poems, and (fabricated) Turkmen history. Written to &quot;recover real Turkmen history without Soviet distortions&quot;, Niyazov promised the return of an atavist past from the times of Oghuz Khagan, but only if the conduct of ancient Turkmens were emulated in accordance to his sage guidance. 

According to Amieke Bouma, a scholar of post-socialist historiography, it is best treated as an epic in its own right: the Oğuzname of the third millennium. Tanya L. Shields reads it as an anti-colonial autobiography, which gets &quot;almost comic in its grandiosity&quot;. It has been compared to Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s &quot;Nutuk&quot;, and Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s &quot;Trilogiya&quot;.

== Contents ==

=== Volume 1 ===
Stories and proverbs are borrowed from existing Turkmen epics – &quot;Oğuzname&quot;, &quot;Book of Dede Korkut&quot;, and &quot;Epic of Koroghlu&quot; – in preaching of morals and promotion of a model code of conduct. These are often supplemented with Niyazov&#x27;s explanatory annotations. Virtues like generosity, unity, humility, hospitality, patience, honesty, defence of fatherland, protection of female dignity, and caring for horses (something that is placed into utmost importance by Niyazov&#x27;s successor) are emphasised upon. Some of his own poems singing paeans of the Turkmen are present, too.

The &quot;Shajara-i Tarākima&quot; (unattributed) and writings of Ahmad ibn Fadlan are relied upon for a reconstruction of national history. Some seventy states are alleged to have been established by them – the Anau culture, Parthian Empire, Achaemenid Empire, Seljuk Empire, and Ottoman Empire among others – till the eighteenth century; this entire span was simultaneously periodised into four epic-epochs. Distinct since the inception of humans, the Turkmen were the same as the Turks and descended from the venerable Noah via Oghuz Khagan, who had set up the first polity c. 5000 years ago. Warfare was apparently rare, and the state always preferred peace. Despite vague references to archaeo-historical evidence to support this range of pioneer assertions, there is a total lack of source material, as understood in an academic sense.

The Persian sphere of influence on Turkmen polity across medieval era was neatly purged; though, Zoroaster was appropriated as a Turkmen hero who had advised people to not abide by Mazdak&#x27;s path of fire-worship. Both 18th and 19th century – integral to the foundation of modern Turkmenistan – are skipped except for the mention of Magtymguly Pyragy and the Battle of Geok Tepe. Soviet Turkmenistan is described in a single page, where it is blamed for colonisation. The narrative resumes with Niyazov ushering in independence of the state. Several of his specific policies find a mention.

Niyazov&#x27;s life is described to great details throughout the text – loss of parents in childhood, attachment to land, and his patriotic zeal for attaining sovereignty from Soviet imperialism. These descriptions form an embedded strata of the volume.

=== Volume 2 ===
Drafted with explicit parallels to the Quran, this volume asked that the &quot;Ruhnama&quot; be recited as regular prayer after purifying oneself; it was also to never lie in an improper place.

Thematically, the volume is concerned with morals and ethics. A total of 21 chapters deal with optimum manners and decorum for different situations and target audiences. Niyazov&#x27;s own narration gains a position of authority; he does not always seek support from the epics to support his positions.

== Society ==

=== Niyazov ===
Niccolosi notes &quot;Ruhnama&quot; to have transformed Turkmenistan into an &quot;epideictic space&quot;, which was in &quot;permanent, unanimous exultation of the person of Niyazov&quot;. Bouma found the &quot;Ruhnama&quot; to rebirth Turkmenistan under Niyazov&#x27;s responsible leadership. The most significant component of ideological propaganda during the later phase of Niyazov&#x27;s personality cult, the text was a marker of politico-cultural literacy and key to survival in post-Soviet Turkmenistan. Niyazov claimed those who read it thrice were destined for heaven.

After the publication of the second volume, Niyazov had mosques and churches display the Ruhnama as prominently as the Quran and Bible, and cite its passages during sermons. The Türkmenbaşy Ruhy Mosque, which was commissioned in 2002 at his birthplace, is the largest mosque in Central Asia and features engravings from the Ruhnama as well as the Quran across its wall and minarets. A twenty foot tall neon Ruhnama was erected at an Ashgabat park in 2003. A mural of Niyazov drafting the Ruhnama has been put in place, too. In August 2005, the first volume was launched into orbit so that it could &quot;conquer space&quot;.

A photo-journalistic essay in 2006 noted the nation to be filled with advertisements of Ruhnama – each at a cost of two dollars. Government offices featured the Ruhnama prominently on their desk (often devoting a separate room), and state media regularly broadcast their content, with religious reverence. Official ceremonies featured hundreds of Turkmens singing from the book. 12 September was declared a national holiday.

==== Education ====
&quot;Ruhnama&quot; was the most integral aspect of the national educational curriculum across multiple domains. This emphasis on Ruhnama obviously ran in parallel to a rapid deterioration in overall standards of education.

A course in &quot;Ruhnama&quot; was mandated for all students in school as part of social sciences. It was also made a required reading across all universities, and knowledge of the text was necessary for holding state employment; this perpetuated discrimination on minorities who were not proficient in Turkmen. Turkmen State University even had a &quot;Department of the Holy Ruhnama of Türkmenbaşy the Great&quot;, and &quot;Ruhnama&quot; Studies were pursued as a major research agenda in the country, often at the cost of academic disciplines.

The text also doubled as the sole government-approved version of history across all Turkmen schools until Niyazov&#x27;s demise, and had a substantial negative effect on academic scholarship. Several conferences on &quot;Ruhnama&quot; itself were organised by historical and cultural institutes. Other common topics were Turkmen epics, ancient Turkmen culture, and men of eminence – all deriving from &quot;Ruhnama&quot;. The only books which were allowed to be published were those whose views were in service of Ruhnama; Turkmenistan does not have a significant record of public debates surrounding history, unlike other post-Soviet states.

In 2004, primary and secondary schools were assigned between two and four hours a week to &quot;Ruhnama&quot; while universities were assigned from four to eight hours. 26 of the 57 examination cards for the 2006 Turkmenistan University Entrance Examination revolved around themes set in &quot;Ruhnama&quot;. In the words of Laura E. Kennedy, Ruhnama was taught with a theological zeal.

=== Berdimuhamedow ===
In his early days, &quot;Ruhnama&quot; was led away from its earlier spot-of-prominence though it continued to be a part of educational curricula. In Spring of 2007, official references to &quot;Ruhnama&quot; were trimmed and around 2009–10, television broadcasts of Ruhnama stopped. Scholars have noted these incremental changes to fit Berdimuhamedow&#x27;s posturing as a would-be harbinger of Turkmen renaissance, which necessitated partial critique of his predecessor&#x27;s tenure.

In 2011, the requirement to pass a secondary-school examination on the &quot;Ruhnama&quot; was rescinded. And in 2014, it was finally declared that Turkmen universities would no longer test applicants on their knowledge of the book, in what Slavomir Horak interpreted as the total purge of &quot;Ruhnama&quot; from Turkmen educational curricula.

It has been noted that books written by Berdimuhamedow, Niyazov&#x27;s successor, had begun to be included in coursework following his inauguration as leader. Luca Anceschi, an expert on the region and University of Glasgow professor, saw this as a transfer of Niyazov&#x27;s cult of personality to Berdimuhamedow.

== Translations ==
The &quot;Ruhnama&quot; has been translated to over 50 languages. These translations were primarily designed by foreign corporations to gain a cordial relationship with Niyazov, and were not meant for international consumption.

These state-authorized translations vary substantially from one to another, leading Dan Shapira to conclude that the text remains in flux. The English version was translated from a Turkish translation of &quot;Ruhnama&quot;; it does not correspond to the Turkmen version in many places, but is generally more accurate and bulky than the Russian translation.

== Media ==
&quot;Shadow of the Holy Book&quot; is a documentary on human rights abuses in Turkmenistan.

<doc id="286440" wikidata="Q2306347" url="?curid=286440" title="Space Patrol (1950 TV series)">
<text>Space Patrol is an American science fiction adventure series set in the 30th century that was originally aimed at juvenile audiences via television, radio, and comic books. It was broadcast on ABC from March 1950 to February 1955. It soon developed a sizable adult audience, and by 1954 the program consistently ranked in the top 10 shows broadcast on a Saturday.

==Premise==
The stories followed the 30th-century adventures of Commander-in-Chief Buzz Corry (Ed Kemmer) of the United Planets Space Patrol and his young sidekick Cadet Happy (Lyn Osborn), as they faced interplanetary villains with diabolical schemes.

The show was targeted to children, but attracted a sizable adult audience. Many episodes featured commercial tie-in merchandise, like toys and mail-order premiums, that were advertised during commercial breaks. Many of the ads for corporate sponsor Ralston Purina&#x27;s Chex cereals used the show&#x27;s space opera motif in their pitches. A unique feature of the TV and radio adventures was that the premium of the month was often worked into the story action. This permitted young viewers to feel that they were participating in the radio or televised adventures. &quot;Space Patrol&quot;″s best known premium was a &quot;Name the Planet&quot; contest wherein the winner was awarded the program&#x27;s Terra IV spaceship. The prize was a giant trailer in the shape of the series&#x27; space craft. One of the many &quot;Name the Planet&quot; commercials may be viewed online.

The program sponsored a &quot;Space Patrol&quot; club, which viewers could join. Continuing merchandise tie-ins perpetuated the connection, producing such a sizable following that many of the nation&#x27;s magazines chronicled the phenomenon. Many, but not all, of the 30-minute TV episodes are still currently available in various video/ DVD formats.

==Radio series==
The radio version ran from 4 October 1952 to 19 March 1955, for 129 episodes. The same cast performed on both shows. The writers, scripts, and directors were reused between the radio and TV incarnations, but the radio broadcasts were not limited by studio sets and became more expansive in scope than the television programs. Although there was seldom any deliberate crossing-over of storylines, some of the television villains regularly appeared on the radio (notably Prince Bacarratti), and during the &quot;Planet X&quot; story, both the TV and radio versions explored the rogue planet&#x27;s invasion of the &quot;Space Patrol&quot; universe.

While the radio series lacked the sophistication of sci-fi shows like the later &quot;X Minus One&quot;, it was enjoyed as a throwback to the Golden Age of space opera popularized in the 1930s by pioneering magazine editor Hugo Gernsback. Only 117 of the original broadcasts survive. 97 are on the OTR site and a few others on torrent sites.

==Production==

&quot;Space Patrol&quot; was the first West Coast morning network program broadcast to the East Coast, via a massive network of cable and electronic interchanges. The program was televised from the original soundstage where the Lon Chaney motion picture &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; had been filmed. The &quot;Phantom Stage&quot; was one of the largest TV stages in Hollywood, and made a great home for &quot;Space Patrol&quot;. While other televised science fiction programs such as &quot;Captain Video&quot; and &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot; used smaller sound stages, &quot;Space Patrol&quot; sets grew larger and larger. The studio had catwalks high above the stage that were used for many of the scenes, especially those requiring large castle-like sets. Likewise, cast members could be suspended in &quot;space&quot; outside their spacecraft without the problems of studio cramping.

&quot;Space Patrol&quot;&#x27;s creator was William &quot;Mike&quot; Moser, a World War II veteran United States naval aviator. In frequent interviews such as one given to &quot;Time&quot; magazine in March 1952, Moser stated that he developed the series idea while flying across the Pacific. He was determined to create a children&#x27;s television program that was as exciting to them as Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon had been to him during his youth. Moser took his idea to KECA-TV, a local Los Angeles ABC station. They bought the concept and &quot;Space Patrol&quot; began airing in March 1950.

Glen Denning was originally cast in the lead as &quot;Commander-in-Chief Kit Corry&quot; and comedian Lyn Osborn as the youthful sidekick &quot;Cadet Happy&quot;. Denning had continual problems remembering lines and delivering them and was replaced after about 25 episodes. War hero Ed Kemmer, a graduate of the Pasadena Playhouse, was his replacement. Denning most likely didn&#x27;t mind leaving the show, as each cast member was paid only $8 per episode (by 1952, however, the show&#x27;s budget had increased to $25,000 a week and by 1954 Lyn Osborn&#x27;s salary alone had increased to around $900 a week.) Osborn, like Kemmer, studied at the Playhouse and had introduced Kemmer to Mike Moser. Kemmer&#x27;s seriousness and military bearing brought a maturity to the role that helped to increase the popularity of the series.

Both the 30-minute and 15-minute programs were performed and broadcast live. If a line was flubbed or an accident happened, the actors recovered as quickly as possible and soldiered on. The pressure of memorizing lines for a new live 15-minute show every day (Monday through Friday) was onerous enough, but became even more burdensome when the 30-minute weekly Saturday show was added beginning Dec. 30, 1950. Around this time, Moser began sharing the writing chores with Norman Jolley. The actors&#x27; tasks were increasingly difficult because they faced the complexity of coordinating their on-camera movements with intricate special effects, which also had to be created live and in real-time. For example, pistols that shot invisible rays necessitated pre-positioning small electrically wired explosive charges on the surface they were supposed to strike. An actor would aim the prop ray gun at that location and squeeze the trigger, whereupon a special effects worker off-scene would throw the detonation switch.

A practical videotape system was not available until after &quot;Space Patrol&quot;″s run, so for distribution to distant stations the image on a small, bright TV monitor was filmed using a motion picture camera with a specially modified and synchronized shutter mechanism, creating kinescope recordings on 16 mm or 35 mm film. Most of the Saturday half-hour TV broadcasts survived in this form and so are still available today. The 15-minute weekday version of the program was at first seen mainly in the Los Angeles broadcast area, but was later also seen nationwide by syndication via kinescope films.

When Mike Moser was killed in a car accident in 1954, his wife Helen became executive producer and Bela Kovacs was appointed associate producer. Moser&#x27;s plans for another, more adult-oriented sci-fi series called &quot;Report to Earth&quot; never came to fruition as the result of his sudden death. After the Russians launched Sputnik, &quot;Space Patrol&quot; was hurriedly syndicated under the title &quot;Satellite Police&quot;, with new titles and credits spliced onto the kinescopes.

==Broadcast==
The &quot;Space Patrol&quot; television show began broadcasting March 9, 1950, as a Monday-through-Friday 15-minute show on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) owned-and-operated Los Angeles station, KECA (now KABC-TV). On December 30, 1950, ABC added a half-hour version of the program to its Saturday schedule. It became an overnight sensation, and the new weekly show and the 15-minute shows continued concurrently on a local basis. It was seen via kinescope syndication in other cities. A 1953 30-minute episode was the subject of the first U.S. experimental 3D television broadcast on April 29 in Los Angeles on KECA (since renamed KECA-TV).

The series made history by being the first regular live West Coast morning network program beamed to the East Coast. At the time, it took an intricate network of cable and relay stations to accomplish this enormous task.

The ABC television &quot;Space Patrol&quot; broadcasts became one of the nation&#x27;s first mass media phenomena, and an ABC radio companion series was developed. The radio program was also popular and ran from September 18, 1950 until March 19, 1955 producing 129 thirty-minute episodes.

The televised &quot;Space Patrol&quot; aired continuously until July 2, 1954; after a short break, it reappeared on September 4, 1954, before finally disappearing from the air on February 26, 1955. 210 half-hour shows and close to 900 15-minute shows were made over &quot;Space Patrol&quot;&#x27;s 5-year run. The sponsors included Purina/Ralston and Nestles.

Despite the American series being nearly a decade old, when a similarly themed UK children&#x27;s puppet series also titled &quot;Space Patrol&quot; was syndicated to America in the early 1960s, it had to be retitled &quot;Planet Patrol&quot; so as to avoid confusion.

==In other media==

===Records===
There were at least two records available in the early 1950s, featuring &quot;prequel&quot; situations involving Commander Corry and Cadet Happy, and starring the radio/TV cast, although the &#x27;origin&#x27; story for Cadet Happy contradicted both the 15-minute and 30-minute TV show versions.

Columbia Gramaphone (Aust) Pty. Ltd released a 78 record in the 1950s KO1015, &quot;Space Patrol Adventures&quot; No.1 of a series, &quot;Cadet Happy Joins Commander Corry&quot;. Happy wins the Corry Scholarship and is then practically adopted by Commander Corry to train as his aide on the side of right and justice. It is based in the 31st century. Buzz Corry is played by Ed Kemmer, Cadet Happy by Lyn Osborn, Gaff Carter by Roy Engel, and Carol Carlyle by Virginia Hewitt; the narrator is Dick Tufeld, and the Control Tower voice is Norman Jolley.

===Books, comic books, and other publications===
A comic book tie-in, &quot;Space Patrol&quot;, published by Ziff-Davis in 1952, ran two issues. It featured cover paintings by Norman Saunders and Clarence Doore. Bernard Krigstein illustrated the scripts by Phil Evans. The comics retail for about $1,000 each today in high grade condition.

Unlike &quot;Tom Corbett, Space Cadet&quot;, &quot;Space Patrol&quot; was never featured in a daily or Sunday newspaper comic strip, nor was there a series of juvenile novels recounting &quot;Space Patrol&quot; adventures.

Jean-Noel Bassior authored an extensive book in 2005 titled &quot;Space Patrol: Missions of Daring in the Name of Early Television&quot;. The book from McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers was well received and created new interest in the television and radio show.

There was a three-issue &quot;Space Patrol&quot; comic book series in the early 1990s which purported to be of the TV series, but whose writer and artist admitted they had never seen the show. This adaptation suffered greatly because of this.

==Legacy==
Actor Ed Kemmer attended many of the important film festivals during the late 90s and early 2000s and discovered a renewed &quot;Space Patrol&quot; popularity that continued up until the time of his death in 2004. The emergence of electronic media during the 1990s permitted a greater interchange of &quot;Space Patrol&quot; merchandise that heretofore had been closely held by collectors. This stimulated new interest and, in turn, production of new publications and merchandise for &quot;Space Patrol&quot; fans. A rather extensive book written by Jean Noel Bassior furthered interest in the series, as did the production of a new set of &quot;Space Patrol&quot; trading cards, replicas of the program&#x27;s space craft, clocks, jackets and other period paraphernalia.

The original space ship prop control panel sold at auction in 2014 for $23,000.

<doc id="286444" wikidata="Q15227892" url="?curid=286444" title="Ideal Home Show">
<text>The Ideal Home Show (formerly called the Ideal Home Exhibition) is an annual event in London, England, held at Olympia. The show was devised by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper in 1908 and continued to be run by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; until 2009. It was then sold to events and publishing company Media 10.

==Overview==

The goal of the Ideal Home Show is to bring together everything associated with having an &quot;ideal home&quot;, such as the latest inventions for the modern house, and to showcase the latest housing designs. A regular feature of the show for many years was the Ideal House Competition, where designs were invited and the winning schemes erected at the exhibition the following year.

The first exhibition was held in 1908 at the Olympia exhibition centre, with sections dedicated to &quot;phases of home life&quot; such as construction, food and cookery, furniture and decoration. Demonstrations and contests included an Arts and Crafts competition and a competition to design the &quot;Ideal Home&quot;. Wareham Smith, advertising manager of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, founded the exhibition as a marketing event for the newspaper. It was often visited by celebrities and royalty.

The archive is held at the V and A Museum.

==1908–1919==
The inaugural &quot;Daily Mail&quot; Ideal Home Exhibition was opened by the Lord Mayor of London at Olympia and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; explained that you would see: 

Visitors queued to view the furnished houses and to tour a landscaped garden. Stands became rooms with all the merchandise available for sale – offering the opportunity for people to see the latest designs for luxury living. 

In 1908, 90 per cent of the population rented their home. It took more than 3,000 men a week to build the first Exhibition.

Lord Northcliffe, proprietor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, founded the Ideal Home exhibition in 1908 at London&#x27;s Olympia exhibition centre, in the spirit of social reform, to stimulate debate about better housing conditions. For a fee of one shilling, the public were educated and entertained by displays of labour-saving appliances and show homes.

The exhibition was next held in 1910, then 1912 and 1913, disrupted by the 1914–18 First World War.

A dispute about the content of a room designed by members of the Omega Workshops for the 1913 show was instrumental in the secession of several artists from that group.

==The 1920s and 1930s==
Technological developments gathered pace throughout the 1920s and 1930s and new products were often featured in demonstrations at the Show. The event became a focal point for the housewife to view the latest in household technology.

Throughout the 1930s building was Britain&#x27;s chief industry, and the suburbs began to spread. Mortgages were becoming more accessible and more people than ever before bought their first home.

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was committed to the drive for greater efficiency and for one year in 1921 it even renamed the show the &quot;&quot;Daily Mail&quot; Efficiency Exhibition&quot;. In 1939, the BBC transmitted a television broadcast from the event for the first time although it had been making radio broadcasts from the exhibition since 1923.

==1940s–1970s==
The Second World War meant that the exhibition was suspended from 1940 to 1946 but from 1947 onwards it continued to grow, culminating in a huge attendance in 1957 of almost 1.5 million people. The show continued to &quot;Educate and Entertain&quot; throughout the decades and in 1953, year of the Coronation of Elizabeth II, the exhibition even featured a two-thirds scale copy of the state coach.

The first microwave oven was launched at the show in 1947. In 1957 the British housewife still spent an average of 70 hours a week on housework

The 1960s was an era of forward-looking fashion and the first humans on the Moon, yet the most popular house style of the period was mock-Georgian. One exhibit, in 1960, &quot;A Home in Space&quot; was created by the Douglas Aircraft Company. It was a full mockup of a potential space station design and visited by 150,000–200,000 people. It has been cited as an important step towards the creation of operative space stations.

The disco decade of the 1970s ushered in a new look for interiors featuring chrome and smoked glass, and the show reflected trends in all the latest house designs and interiors.

== 1980–present ==
Corner baths and conservatories caught the eye in the 1980s and new technology was still very much in evidence. Through the 1990s, a new shopping experience was developed for the Show, with entertainment high on the agenda and a mission to provide everything for the home in one environment.

In 1997, a rainforest was created and visitors could experience a tropical downpour every hour from the shelter of a tree house.
In 2008, people could take a trip down memory lane and see some of the highlights of the last century in the Century Street.
In September 2009 the show changed hands for the first time in its history, after being sold by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; to Media 10.
The 2010 Ideal Home Show won the award for Best Consumer Show over 2,000sqm at the Industry AEO Awards.
The 2011 Ideal Home Show took place from 11 to 27 March at Earls Court Exhibition Centre. With more than 50,000 buyers each exhibitor sold goods worth £1,000,000.

In 2008, one of the more adventurous bedroom recreations was that of Shirley Bassey. Bassey appeared to have a 10&#x27; x 10&#x27; bedroom, with bedlinen from Dunelm Group. A mannequin of Bassey, dressed in tight-fitting sequined nightie, was stood – arms outstretched – as though she&#x27;d just got out of bed to sing &quot;Goldfinger&quot; to members of the public passing through her Ideal Home bedroom.

<doc id="286454" wikidata="Q923906" url="?curid=286454" title="Settling">
<text>Settling is the process by which particulates move towards the bottom of a liquid and form a sediment. Particles that experience a force, either due to gravity or due to centrifugal motion will tend to move in a uniform manner in the direction exerted by that force. For gravity settling, this means that the particles will tend to fall to the bottom of the vessel, forming sludge or slurry at the vessel base.
Settling is an important operation in many applications, such as mining, wastewater and drinking water treatment, biological science, space propellant reignition, 
and scooping.

== Physics ==
For settling particles that are considered individually, i.e. dilute particle solutions, there are two main forces enacting upon any particle. The primary force is an applied force, such as gravity, and a drag force that is due to the motion of the particle through the fluid. The applied force is usually not affected by the particle&#x27;s velocity, whereas the drag force is a function of the particle velocity.

For a particle at rest no drag force will be exhibited, which causes the particle to accelerate due to the applied force. When the particle accelerates, the drag force acts in the direction opposite to the particle&#x27;s motion, retarding further acceleration, in the absence of other forces drag directly opposes the applied force. As the particle increases in velocity eventually the drag force and the applied force will approximately equate, causing no further change in the particle&#x27;s velocity. This velocity is known as the terminal velocity, &quot;settling velocity&quot; or &quot;fall velocity&quot; of the particle. This is readily measurable by examining the rate of fall of individual particles.

The terminal velocity of the particle is affected by many parameters, i.e. anything that will alter the particle&#x27;s drag. Hence the terminal velocity is most notably dependent upon grain size, the shape (roundness and sphericity) and density of the grains, as well as to the viscosity and density of the fluid.

=== Single particle drag ===

==== Stokes&#x27; drag ====
For dilute suspensions, Stokes&#x27; law predicts the settling velocity of small spheres in fluid, either air or water. This originates due to the strength of viscous forces at the surface of the particle providing the majority of the retarding force. Stokes&#x27; law finds many applications in the natural sciences, and is given by:

:formula_1

where &quot;w&quot; is the settling velocity, &quot;ρ&quot; is density (the subscripts &quot;p&quot; and &quot;f&quot; indicate particle and fluid respectively), &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration due to gravity, &quot;r&quot; is the radius of the particle and &quot;μ&quot; is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.

Stokes&#x27; law applies when the Reynolds number, Re, of the particle is less than 0.1. Experimentally Stokes&#x27; law is found to hold within 1% for formula_2, within 3% for formula_3 and within 9% formula_4. With increasing Reynolds numbers, Stokes law begins to break down due to the increasing importance of fluid inertia, requiring the use of empirical solutions to calculate drag forces.

==== Newtonian drag ====
Defining a drag coefficient, formula_5, as the ratio of the force experienced by the particle divided by the impact pressure of the fluid, a coefficient that can be considered as the transfer of available fluid force into drag is established. In this region the inertia of the impacting fluid is responsible for the majority of force transfer to the particle.

:formula_6

For a spherical particle in the Stokes regime this value is not constant, however in the Newtonian drag regime the drag on a sphere can be approximated by a constant, 0.44. This constant value implies that the efficiency of transfer of energy from the fluid to the particle is not a function of fluid velocity.

As such the terminal velocity of a particle in a Newtonian regime can again be obtained by equating the drag force to the applied force, resulting in the following expression

:formula_7

==== Transitional drag ====
In the intermediate region between Stokes drag and Newtonian drag, there exists a transitional regime, where the analytical solution to the problem of a falling sphere becomes problematic. To solve this, empirical expressions are used to calculate drag in this region. One such empirical equation is that of Schiller and Naumann, and may be valid for formula_8:

:formula_9

=== Hindered settling ===
Stokes, transitional and Newtonian settling describe the behaviour of a single spherical particle in an infinite fluid, known as free settling. However this model has limitations in practical application. Alternate considerations, such as the interaction of particles in the fluid, or the interaction of the particles with the container walls can modify the settling behaviour. Settling that has these forces in appreciable magnitude is known as hindered settling. Subsequently, semi-analytic or empirical solutions may be used to perform meaningful hindered settling calculations.

== Applications ==
The solid-gas flow systems are present in many industrial applications, as dry, catalytic reactors, settling tanks, pneumatic conveying of solids, among others. Obviously, in industrial operations the drag rule is not simple as a single sphere settling in a stationary fluid. However, this knowledge indicates how drag behaves in more complex systems, which are designed and studied by engineers applying empirical and more sophisticated tools.

For example, &#x27;settling tanks&#x27; are used for separating solids and/or oil from another liquid. In food processing, the vegetable is crushed and placed inside of a settling tank with water. The oil floats to the top of the water then is collected. In drinking water and waste water treatment a flocculant or coagulant is often added prior to settling to form larger particles that settle out quickly in a settling tank or (lamella) clarifier, leaving the water with a lower turbidity.

In winemaking, the French term for this process is &quot;débourbage&quot;. This step usually occurs in white wine production before the start of fermentation.

===Settleable solids analysis===
Settleable solids are the particulates that settle out of a still fluid. Settleable solids can be quantified for a suspension using an Imhoff cone. The standard Imhoff cone of transparent glass or plastic holds one liter of liquid and has calibrated markings to measure the volume of solids accumulated in the bottom of the conical container after settling for one hour. A standardized Imhoff cone procedure is commonly used to measure suspended solids in wastewater or stormwater runoff. The simplicity of the method makes it popular for estimating water quality. To numerically gauge the stability of suspended solids and predict agglomeration and sedimentation events, zeta potential is commonly analyzed. This parameter indicates the electrostatic repulsion between solid particles and can be used to predict whether aggregation and settling will occur over time.

The water sample to be measured should be representative of the total stream. Samples are best collected from the discharge falling from a pipe or over a weir, because samples skimmed from the top of a flowing channel may fail to capture larger, high-density solids moving along the bottom of the channel. The sampling bucket is vigorously stirred to uniformly re-suspend all collected solids immediately before pouring the volume required to fill the cone. The filled cone is immediately placed in a stationary holding rack to allow quiescent settling. The rack should be located away from heating sources, including direct sunlight, which might cause currents within the cone from thermal density changes of the liquid contents. After 45 minutes of settling, the cone is partially rotated about its axis of symmetry just enough to dislodge any settled material adhering to the side of the cone. Accumulated sediment is observed and measured fifteen minutes later, after one hour of total settling time.

<doc id="286455" wikidata="Q376032" url="?curid=286455" title="Tribadism">
<text>Tribadism ( ) or tribbing, commonly known by its scissoring position, is a lesbian sexual practice involving vulva-to-vulva contact or rubbing the vulva against the partner&#x27;s thigh, stomach, buttocks, arm, or other body parts (excluding the mouth), especially for stimulation of the clitoris. A variety of sex positions are practiced, including the missionary position.

The term &quot;tribadism&quot; originally encompassed societal beliefs about women&#x27;s capability of being penetrative sexual partners. Women accused of having been penetrative during sexual activity were subject to ridicule or punishment. In modern times, the term typically refers to various forms of non-penetrative sex between women.

It is analogous to frot, which is penis-to-penis contact between men.

==History and culture==
===Etymology and usage===
The term &quot;tribadism&quot; derives from the Greek word τριβάς (&quot;tribas&quot;), which in turn comes from the verb τρίβω (&quot;tribō&quot;), &quot;rub&quot;. In ancient Greek and Roman sexuality, a tribas, or tribade (IPA:), was a woman or intersex individual who actively penetrated another person (male or female) through use of the clitoris or a dildo. The term &quot;tribade&quot; did not begin to refer exclusively to eroticism between women until Late Antiquity. Because penetration was viewed as &quot;male-defined&quot; sexuality, a tribas was considered the most vulgar lesbian. The Greeks and Romans recognized same-sex attraction, but as any sexual act was believed to require that one of the partners be &quot;phallic&quot; and that therefore sexual activity between women was impossible without this feature, mythology popularly associated lesbians with either having enlarged clitorises or as incapable of enjoying sexual activity without the substitution of a phallus. This appears in Greek and Latin satires as early as the late first century.

In English texts, &quot;tribade&quot; is recorded as early as 1601, in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Praeludium&quot; (Poem X in &quot;The Forest&quot;), to as late as the mid-nineteenth century; it was the most common lesbian term in European texts, through the proliferation of classical literature, anatomies, midwiferies, sexual advice manuals, and pornography. It also came to refer to lesbian sexual practices in general, though anatomical investigation in the mid-eighteenth century led to skepticism about stories of enlarged clitorises and anatomists and doctors argued for a more precise distinction between clitoral hypertrophy and hermaphroditism.

Author Bonnie Zimmerman stated, &quot;More often, however, [European] writers avoided the term, instead euphemistically invoking &#x27;unnatural vice,&#x27; &#x27;lewd behavior,&#x27; &#x27;crimes against nature,&#x27; &#x27;using an instrument,&#x27; and &#x27;taking the part of a man.&#x27; In the eighteenth century, where the term saw one of its most popular uses, it was employed in several pornographic libels against Marie Antoinette, who was &quot;tried and roundly convicted in the press&quot; as being a tribade. &quot;[Her] rumored tribadism had historically specific political implications,&quot; stated author Dena Goodman. &quot;Consider her final (fictive) testimony in &quot;The Confession of Marie-Antoinette&quot;: &#x27;People!&#x27; she protests, &#x27;because I ceded to the sweet impressions of nature, and in imitating the charming weakness of all the women of the court of France, I surrendered to the sweet impulsion of love...you hold me, as it were, captive within your walls?&#x27;&quot; Goodman elaborated that in one libel, Marie-Antoinette is described as generously providing details of her husband&#x27;s &quot;incapacity in the venereal act&quot; and that her lust resulted in her taking an aristocratic beauty Yolande de Polastron, the Duchess of Polignac (1749–1793), &quot;into [her] service&quot; and later specifying that what makes sex with a woman so appealing is &quot;Adroit in the art of stimulating the clitoris&quot;; Marie-Antoinette is described as having stated that La Polignac&#x27;s attentions produced &quot;one of those rare pleasures that cannot be used up because it can be repeated as many times as one likes&quot;.

By the time the Victorian era arrived, cited Zimmerman, &quot;tribadism tended to be constructed as a lower class and non-Western phenomenon and often was associated with the supposed degeneration of prostitutes and criminals&quot;. By the twentieth century, &quot;&quot;tribade&quot; had been supplanted&quot; by the terms &quot;sapphist&quot;, &quot;lesbian&quot;, &quot;invert&quot;, and &quot;homosexual&quot;, as &quot;tribade&quot; had become too archaic to use. &quot;Fricatrice&quot;, a synonym for &quot;tribade&quot; that also refers to rubbing but has a Latin rather than a Greek root, appeared in English texts as early as 1605 (in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot;). Its usage suggests that it was more colloquial and more pejorative than &quot;tribade&quot;. Variants include the Latinized &quot;confricatrice&quot; and English &quot;rubster&quot;.

===Sexual practices===
====Sex positions and other aspects====
Tribadism is a common sexual practice among women who have sex with women (WSW). Although the term &quot;tribadism&quot; is often applied to the act of vulva-to-vulva stimulation, it encompasses a variety of sexual activity. In addition to the scissoring position, which involves the partners interlocking their legs in a position similar to the shape of scissors and pressing their vulvas together, tribadism may involve the missionary position, the woman on top position, the doggy style position or others, or simple movement of the woman&#x27;s vulva against her partner&#x27;s thigh, stomach, buttocks, arm, or another body part. Sometimes &quot;mutuality and reciprocation tend not to be the main objective, although satisfaction for both partners through different means most definitely is its aim&quot;. Women who enjoy or prefer tribadism report finding pleasure from its allowance of whole-body contact, the experience of timing hip movement and feeling their partner&#x27;s motions without manual stimulation, which is considered exciting, erotic and a much easier way to achieve orgasm due to ample clitoral stimulation.

Women who enjoy tribadism share methods through verbal and text communication, and they emphasize the importance of repeated body movement(reciprocation) to reach orgasm, such as rubbing back and forth and bumping up and down. It means tribadism is more than just local-clitoral stimulation(aim); it should involve every inch of the vulva. Because the sexual pleasure of tribadism is influenced by the psychological sense of satisfaction and happiness from feeling the individual&#x27;s private body parts through female genital contact, interaction, and communication between the two individuals.

Some lesbian and bisexual women do not engage in the scissoring position because they find or think it would be physically uncomfortable. They may also think it is a misconception that lesbians engage in the act and is therefore not representative of lesbian sexual practices, attributing it more so to the male fantasies of the heterosexual porn industry. By contrast, some sources, including Shere Hite&#x27;s 1976 and 1981 research, indicate that women may enjoy performing the scissoring position with other women because it is a variation of vulva-to-vulva contact or can allow for maximum such contact and therefore an elevated level of intimacy.

&quot;Scissoring&quot; is commonly used as an umbrella term for all forms of tribadism, and many lesbian and bisexual women are unaware that some of the sexual acts they include in their lovemaking are aspects of and are formally labeled &quot;tribadism&quot;, as tribadism is commonly omitted from mainstream sex research. Scholar Judith Halberstam stated, &quot;If we trace the use of the term forward into present, we find that tribadism is one of those rarely discussed but often practiced sexual activities, and the silence that surrounds it now is as puzzling as the discourse it produced in earlier centuries.&quot; Halberstam added that Sigmund Freud &quot;had nothing to say&quot; with regard to the topic, &quot;and few contemporary lesbian sex books even discuss it&quot;.

According to older studies, &quot;approximately one-third of lesbian women used tribadism, or body contact, as a means of achieving orgasm (Saghir &amp; Robins, 1973; Jay &amp; Young, 1977)&quot;. Masters and Johnson&#x27;s 1979 study on lesbian sexual practices found that lesbians tend to do more overall genital stimulation than direct clitoral stimulation, which is also often the case for heterosexual relationships. Vaginal or anal penetration with dildos or other sex toys is less commonly practiced among lesbians and other WSW. In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) &quot;was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado&quot; and &quot;[w]hen asked what techniques they used in their last 10 lovemaking sessions, 100% were for kissing, sucking on nipples, and manual stimulation of the clitoris; more than 90% reported French kissing, oral sex, and fingers inserted into the vagina; and 80% reported tribadism&quot;.

In 2003, Julia V Bailey and her research team published data based on a sample from the United Kingdom of 803 lesbian and bisexual women attending two London lesbian sexual health clinics and 415 WSW from a community sample; the study reported that 85% of the women engaged in tribadism (which included genital-to-genital contact or rubbing genitals against another part of a partner&#x27;s body). 50% engaged in the genital-genital form. Like older studies, vaginal penetration with dildos, or with other sex toys, among the women was rare.

====Safe sex====
As with any exchange of body fluids during sexual activities, genital-to-genital tribadism is a high-risk sexual practice because it may transfer sexually transmitted infections (STIs) if those are present in one or more of the partners. Genital-genital and genital-body contact (including tribadism) can spread STIs such as human papillomavirus (HPV), pubic lice (crabs) and herpes.

Safe sex options, such as using a dental dam or a cut-open condom, may be practiced. However, there &quot;is no good evidence&quot; that using a dental dam reduces STI transmission risks between women who have sex with women; studies show that using a dental dam as a protection barrier is rarely practiced, and that, among [women who have sex with women], this may be because the individuals have &quot;limited knowledge about the possibilities of STI transmission or [feel] less vulnerable to STIs [such as HIV]&quot;.

In terms of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), sexual behaviors between women such as tribadism are neglected.

===Popular culture and other media===
Tribadism has been referenced in various aspects of popular culture. The glam pop band Scissor Sisters derived their name from the scissoring position. Jake Shears of the group stated that while many of their songs have gay themes, they do not want to be labeled a gay band; they &quot;are first and foremost a pop band&quot;. Other bands named after tribadism include lesbian punk band Tribe 8 and all-male group Scissorfight.

Genital–genital tribadism was depicted three times during the &quot;D-Yikes!&quot; episode of the cartoon &quot;South Park&quot;, referred to in the episode as &quot;scissoring&quot;. The episode is credited with having brought more recognition to the act of scissoring. The term additionally received mainstream recognition after the episode &quot;Duets&quot; of the television series &quot;Glee&quot; had characters Santana Lopez and Brittany S. Pierce reference scissoring while making out. The scene received some criticism for possibly being inappropriate for children.

In 2010, in response to California State University, Long Beach refusing to advertise the play &quot;The Night of the Tribades&quot; on the Seventh Street marquee because of the word &quot;tribades&quot; in its title, approximately 24 theater arts majors protested in front of Brotman Hall by simulating tribadism (including scissoring). &quot;When you put tribade into a Google search image, apparently it comes up with the word tribadism, which is a sex act and they decided it was inappropriate,&quot; stated one student.

Tribadism and other lesbian sex scenes are featured in the 2013 film &quot;Blue Is the Warmest Colour.&quot; The scenes were the subject of debate among lesbians and critics, with the depiction of scissoring being one of the acts that were criticized; in an interview surveying a small panel of lesbian women, one of the women, who was skeptical that lesbian sexual activity included scissoring at all, seemed more open to the idea of a reverse cowgirl position of scissoring; another woman had engaged in the reverse cowgirl position of scissoring. Smith et al. argued that while the portrayal of scissoring in &quot;Blue Is the Warmest Colour&quot; may be considered &quot;entirely lesbian&quot; and &quot;expunging men&quot; because it is non-penetrative sex between women, &quot;the positions chosen seem based more on their ease to photograph/film in a way that provides maximum exposure of both female bodies, as well as an inability to imagine, or depict within heterosexual representational norms, fulfilling sex &quot;without&quot; direct genital-on-genital contact.&quot;

The 2016 film &quot;Blood of the Tribades&quot; is a lesbian-themed vampire story examining gender politics and bigotry.

==Among female bonobos==
Female-female genital sex is not exclusive to humans. Females of the bonobo species also engage in this act, usually referred to by primatologists as &quot;GG rubbing&quot; (genital-to-genital). &quot;Perhaps the bonobo&#x27;s most typical sexual pattern, undocumented in any other primate, is genito-genital rubbing (or GG rubbing) between adult females,&quot; stated primatologist Frans de Waal. &quot;One female facing another clings with arms and legs to a partner that, standing on both hands and feet, lifts her off the ground.&quot;

In bonobos, the clitoris is larger and more externalized than in most mammals. Ethologist Jonathan Balcombe states that bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, &quot;which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement&quot;; on average, female bonobos engage in genital–genital rubbing &quot;about once every two hours&quot;.

According to the researchers from various academic institutions  they found &quot;After sexual interactions with other females, female bonobos also displayed higher levels of oxytocin in the urine. The same, however, did not occur after they had mated with males&quot;, and they suggested this biological reaction of female bonobo may derive a strong influence of on the community. &quot;Female bonobos, it seems, derive more pleasure from sexual engagement with other females. This may also allow them to establish themselves as equal to the males in the community — by sticking together&quot;.

<text>Michel Chamillart or Chamillard (2 January 1652 – 14 April 1721) was a French , a minister of King Louis XIV of France.

Chamillart was born in Paris of a family recently raised to the nobility. Following the usual career of a statesman of his time he became in turn councillor of the &quot;parlement&quot; of Paris (1676), master of requests (1686), and intendant of the generality of Rouen (January 1689). His attractive personality won the confidence of Madame de Maintenon and pleased the king. In 1690 he was made intendant of finances, and on 5 September 1699 the king appointed him Controller-General of Finances, to which he added on the following 7 January the ministry of war. From the first, Chamillart&#x27;s position was a difficult one. The deficit was more than 53 million livres, and the credit of the state was almost exhausted. Chamillart lacked the intelligence and energy necessary for the situation, and was unable to moderate the king&#x27;s warlike tastes, or to inaugurate economic reforms. He could only employ the usual expedients of the time—the immoderate sale of offices, the debasement of the coinage (five times in six years), reduction of the rate of interest on state debts, and increased taxation.

Chamillart attempted to force into circulation a kind of paper money, &quot;billets de monnaie&quot;, with disastrous results owing to the state of credit. He studied Vauban&#x27;s project for the royal tithe, and Boisguillebert&#x27;s proposition for the &quot;taille&quot;, but did not adopt them. In October 1706 he showed the king that the debts immediately due amounted to 288 million, and that the deficit already foreseen for 1707 was 160 million. In October 1707 he saw with consternation that the revenue for 1708 was already entirely eaten up by anticipation, so that neither money nor credit remained for 1708. In these conditions Chamillart, who had often complained of the overwhelming burden he was carrying, and who had already wished to retire in 1706, resigned his office of controller-general. Public opinion attributed to him the ruin of the country, though he had tried in 1700 to improve the condition of commerce by the creation of a council of commerce.

As secretary of state for war he was responsible for raising an army for the War of the Spanish Succession, and had to reorganize it three times, after the defeats of 1704, 1706 and 1708. With an empty treasury he succeeded only in part, and he warned the king that the enemy would soon be able to dictate the terms of peace. He was reproached with having secured the command of the army which besieged Turin (1706) for his son-in-law, the incapable duc de la Feuillade. Even Madame de Maintenon became hostile to him, and he was dismissed from his position on 9 June 1709, retiring to his estates.

Chamillart&#x27;s papers were published by Gustave Esnault, &#x27; (2 vols, Paris, 1885); and by [[A de Boislisle]] in vol. 2 of his&#x27; (1883).

<doc id="286466" wikidata="Q1036221" url="?curid=286466" title="Hydrothermal circulation">
<text>Hydrothermal circulation in its most general sense is the circulation of hot water (Ancient Greek ὕδωρ, &quot;water&quot;, and θέρμη, &quot;heat&quot; ). Hydrothermal circulation occurs most often in the vicinity of sources of heat within the Earth&#x27;s crust. In general, this occurs near volcanic activity, but can occur in the shallow to mid crust along deeply penetrating fault irregularities or in the deep crust related to the intrusion of granite, or as the result of orogeny or metamorphism. Hydrothermal circulation often results in hydrothermal mineral deposits.

==Seafloor hydrothermal circulation==
Hydrothermal circulation in the oceans is the passage of the water through mid-oceanic ridge systems.

The term includes both the circulation of the well-known, high-temperature vent waters near the ridge crests, and the much-lower-temperature, diffuse flow of water through sediments and buried basalts further from the ridge crests. The former circulation type is sometimes termed &quot;active&quot;, and the latter &quot;passive&quot;. In both cases, the principle is the same: Cold, dense seawater sinks into the basalt of the seafloor and is heated at depth whereupon it rises back to the rock-ocean water interface due to its lesser density. The heat source for the active vents is the newly formed basalt, and, for the highest temperature vents, the underlying magma chamber. The heat source for the passive vents is the still-cooling older basalts. Heat flow studies of the seafloor suggest that basalts within the oceanic crust take millions of years to completely cool as they continue to support passive hydrothermal circulation systems.

Hydrothermal vents are locations on the seafloor where hydrothermal fluids mix into the overlying ocean. Perhaps the best-known vent forms are the naturally occurring chimneys referred to as black smokers.

==Volcanic and magma related hydrothermal circulation==

Hydrothermal circulation is not limited to ocean ridge environments. Hydrothermal circulating convection cells can exist in any place an anomalous source of heat, such as an intruding magma or volcanic vent, comes into contact with the groundwater system where permeability allows flow. This convection can manifest as hydrothermal explosions, geysers, and hot springs, although this is not always the case.  

Hydrothermal circulation above magma bodies has been intensively studied in the context of geothermal projects where many deep wells are drilled into the system to produce and subsequently re-inject the hydrothermal fluids. The detailed data sets available from this work show the long term persistence of these systems, the development of fluid circulation patterns, histories that can be influenced by renewed magmatism, fault movement, or changes associated with hydrothermal brecciation and eruption sometimes followed by massive cold water invasion. Less direct but as intensive study has focused on the minerals deposited especially in the upper parts of hydrothermal circulation systems.

Understanding volcanic and magma-related hydrothermal circulation means studying hydrothermal explosions, geysers, hot springs, and other related systems and their interactions with associated surface water and groundwater bodies. A good environment to observe this phenomenon is in volcanogenic lakes where hot springs and geysers are commonly present. The convection systems in these lakes work through cold lake water percolating downward through the permeable lake bed, mixing with groundwater heated by magma or residual heat, and rising to form thermal springs at discharge points.

The existence of hydrothermal convection cells and hot springs or geysers in these environments depends not only on the presence of a colder water body and geothermal heat but also strongly depends on a no-flow boundary at the water table. These systems can develop their own boundaries. For example the water level represents a fluid pressure condition that leads to gas exsolution or boiling that in turn causes intense mineralization that can seal cracks.

==Deep crust==
Hydrothermal also refers to the transport and circulation of water within the deep crust, in general from areas of hot rocks to areas of cooler rocks. The causes for this convection can be:
* Intrusion of magma into the crust
* Radioactive heat generated by cooled masses of granite
* Heat from the mantle
* Hydraulic head from mountain ranges, for example, the Great Artesian Basin
* Dewatering of metamorphic rocks, which liberates water
* Dewatering of deeply buried sediments

Hydrothermal circulation, in particular in the deep crust, is a primary cause of mineral deposit formation and a cornerstone of most theories on ore genesis.

===Hydrothermal ore deposits===
During the early 1900s, various geologists worked to classify hydrothermal ore deposits that they assumed formed from upward-flowing aqueous solutions. Waldemar Lindgren (1860–1939) developed a classification based on interpreted decreasing temperature and pressure conditions of the depositing fluid. His terms: &quot;hypothermal&quot;, &quot;mesothermal&quot;, &quot;epithermal&quot; and &quot;teleothermal&quot;, expressed decreasing temperature and increasing distance from a deep source. Recent studies retain only the &quot;epithermal&quot; label. John Guilbert&#x27;s 1985 revision of Lindgren&#x27;s system for hydrothermal deposits includes the following:

* Ascending hydrothermal fluids, magmatic or meteoric water
** Porphyry copper and other deposits, 200–800 °C, moderate pressure
** Igneous metamorphic, 300–800 °C, low to moderate pressure
** Cordilleran veins, intermediate to shallow depths
** Epithermal, shallow to intermediate, 50–300 °C, low pressure
* Circulating heated meteoric solutions
** Mississippi Valley-type deposits, 25–200 °C, low pressure
** Western US uranium, 25–75 °C, low pressure
* Circulating heated seawater
** Oceanic ridge deposits, 25–300 °C, low pressure

==See also==
*Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit
*Geothermal gradient
*Hydrothermal synthesis

<doc id="286469" wikidata="Q179848" url="?curid=286469" title="Scramble for Africa">
<text>The Scramble for Africa was the invasion, conquest, and colonisation of most of Africa by seven Western European powers driven by the Second Industrial Revolution during the late 19th century and early 20th century in the era of &quot;New Imperialism&quot;: Belgium, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal and Spain.

In 1870, 10% of the continent was formally under European control. By 1914, this figure had risen to almost 90%; the only states retaining sovereignty were Liberia, Ethiopia, Egba, Aussa, Senusiyya, Mbunda, the Dervish State, and the Ovambo kingdoms, most of which were later conquered.

The 1884 Berlin Conference regulated European colonisation and trade in Africa, and is seen as emblematic of the &quot;scramble&quot;. In the last quarter of the 19th century, there were considerable political rivalries between the European empires, which provided the impetus for the colonisation. The later years of the 19th century saw a transition from &quot;informal imperialism&quot; – military influence and economic dominance – to direct rule.

With the decline of the European colonial empires in the wake of the two world wars, most African colonies gained independence during the Cold War, and decided to keep their colonial borders in the Organisation of African Unity conference of 1964 due to fears of civil wars and regional instability, placing emphasis on pan-Africanism.

==Background==


By 1841, businessmen from Europe had established small trading posts along the coasts of Africa, but they seldom moved inland, preferring to stay near the sea. They primarily traded with locals. Large parts of the continent were essentially uninhabitable for Europeans because of their high mortality rates from tropical diseases such as malaria. In the middle of the 19th century, European explorers mapped much of East Africa and Central Africa.

As late as the 1870s, Europeans controlled approximately 10% of the African continent, with all their territories located near the coasts. The most important holdings were Angola and Mozambique, held by Portugal; the Cape Colony, held by the United Kingdom; and Algeria, held by France. By 1914, only Ethiopia and Liberia remained outside European control, with the former eventually being occupied by Italy in 1936 while the latter having strong connections with its historical colonizer, the United States.

Technological advances facilitated European expansion overseas. Industrialization brought about rapid advancements in transportation and communication, especially in the forms of steamships, railways and telegraphs. Medical advances also played an important role, especially medicines for tropical diseases, which helped control their adverse effects. The development of quinine, an effective treatment for malaria, made vast expanses of the tropics more accessible for Europeans.

==Causes==

===Africa and global markets===
Sub-Saharan Africa, one of the last regions of the world largely untouched by &quot;informal imperialism&quot;, was attractive to business entrepreneurs. During a time when Britain&#x27;s balance of trade showed a growing deficit, with shrinking and increasingly protectionist continental markets during the Long Depression (1873–1896), Africa offered Britain, Germany, France, and other countries an open market that would garner them a trade surplus: a market that bought more from the colonial power than it sold overall.

Surplus capital was often more profitably invested overseas, where cheap materials, limited competition, and abundant raw materials made a greater premium possible. Another inducement for imperialism arose from the demand for raw materials, especially ivory, rubber, palm oil, cocoa, diamonds, tea, and tin. Additionally, Britain wanted control of areas of the southern and eastern coasts of Africa for stopover ports on the route to Asia and its empire in India. But, excluding the area that became the Union of South Africa in 1910, European nations invested relatively limited amounts of capital in Africa.

Pro-imperialist colonial lobbyists such as the &quot;Alldeutscher Verband&quot;, Francesco Crispi and Jules Ferry, argued that sheltered overseas markets in Africa would solve the problems of low prices and overproduction caused by shrinking continental markets. John A. Hobson argued in &quot;Imperialism&quot; that this shrinking of continental markets was a key factor of the global &quot;New Imperialism&quot; period. William Easterly, however, disagrees with the link made between capitalism and imperialism, arguing that colonialism is used mostly to promote state-led development rather than corporate development. He has said that &quot;imperialism is not so clearly linked to capitalism and the free markets... historically there has been a closer link between colonialism/imperialism and state-led approaches to development.&quot;

===Strategic rivalry===
While tropical Africa was not a large zone of investment, other overseas regions were. The vast interior between Egypt and the gold and diamond-rich Southern Africa had strategic value in securing the flow of overseas trade. Britain was under political pressure to build up lucrative markets in India, Malaya, Australia and New Zealand. Thus, it wanted to secure the key waterway between East and West – the Suez Canal, completed in 1869. However, a theory that Britain sought to annex East Africa during 1880 onwards, out of geo-strategic concerns connected to Egypt (especially the Suez Canal), has been challenged by historians such as John Darwin (1997) and Jonas F. Gjersø (2015).

The scramble for African territory also reflected concern for the acquisition of military and naval bases, for strategic purposes and the exercise of power. The growing navies, and new ships driven by steam power, required coaling stations and ports for maintenance. Defence bases were also needed for the protection of sea routes and communication lines, particularly of expensive and vital international waterways such as the Suez Canal.

Colonies were seen as assets in balance of power negotiations, useful as items of exchange at times of international bargaining. Colonies with large native populations were also a source of military power; Britain and France used large numbers of British Indian and North African soldiers, respectively, in many of their colonial wars (and would do so again in the coming World Wars). In the age of nationalism there was pressure for a nation to acquire an empire as a status symbol; the idea of &quot;greatness&quot; became linked with the &quot;White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;, or sense of duty, underlying many nations&#x27; strategies.

In the early 1880s, Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza was exploring the region along the Congo River for France, at the same time Henry Morton Stanley explored it on behalf of the Committee for Studies of the Upper Congo, backed by Leopold II of Belgium, who would have it as his personal Congo Free State. Leopold had earlier hoped to recruit Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, but turned to Henry Morton Stanley when the latter was recruited by the French government. France occupied Tunisia in May 1881, which may have convinced Italy to join the German-Austrian Dual Alliance in 1882, thus forming the Triple Alliance. The same year, Britain occupied Egypt (hitherto an autonomous state owing nominal fealty to the Ottoman Empire), which ruled over Sudan and parts of Chad, Eritrea, and Somalia. In 1884, Germany declared Togoland, the Cameroons and South West Africa to be under its protection; and France occupied Guinea. French West Africa was founded in 1895 and French Equatorial Africa in 1910. In French Somaliland, a short-lived Russian colony in the Egyptian fort of Sagallo was briefly proclaimed by Terek Cossacks in 1889.

====Germany&#x27;s &quot;Weltpolitik&quot;====
Germany, divided into small states, was not initially a colonial power. In 1862, Otto von Bismarck became Minister-President of the Kingdom of Prussia, and through a series of wars with both Austria in 1866 and France in 1870 was able to unify all of Germany under Prussian rule. The German Empire was formally proclaimed on 18 January 1871. At first, Bismarck disliked colonies but gave in to popular and elite pressure in the 1880s. He sponsored the 1884–85 Berlin Conference, which set the rules of effective control of African territories and reduced the risk of conflict between colonial powers. Bismarck used private companies to set up small colonial operations in Africa and the Pacific.

Pan-Germanism became linked to the young nation&#x27;s new imperialist drives. In the beginning of the 1880s, the &quot;Deutscher Kolonialverein&quot; was created, and published the &quot;Kolonialzeitung&quot;. This colonial lobby was also relayed by the nationalist &quot;Alldeutscher Verband&quot;. &quot;Weltpolitik&quot; (world policy) was the foreign policy adopted by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890, intending to transform Germany into a global power through aggressive diplomacy, and the development of a large navy. Germany became the third-largest colonial power in Africa, the location of most of its 2.6 million square kilometres of colonial territory and 14 million colonial subjects in 1914. The African possessions were Southwest Africa, Togoland, the Cameroons, and Tanganyika. Germany tried to isolate France in 1905 with the First Moroccan Crisis. This led to the 1905 Algeciras Conference, in which France&#x27;s influence on Morocco was compensated by the exchange of other territories, and then to the Agadir Crisis in 1911.

====Italy&#x27;s expansion====
After fighting alongside France during the Crimean War (1853–1856), the Kingdom of Sardinia sought to unify the Italian peninsula, with French support. Following a war with Austria in 1859, Sardinia, under the leadership of Victor Emmanuel II and Giuseppe Garibaldi, was able to unify most of the peninsula by 1861, establishing the Kingdom of Italy. 

Following unification, Italy sought to expand its territory and become a great power, taking possession of parts of Eritrea in 1870 and 1882. In 1889–90, it occupied territory on the south side of the Horn of Africa, forming what would become Italian Somaliland. In the disorder that followed the 1889 death of Emperor Yohannes IV, General Oreste Baratieri occupied the Ethiopian Highlands along the Eritrean coast, and Italy proclaimed the establishment of a new colony of Eritrea, with its capital moved from Massawa to Asmara. When relations between Italy and Ethiopia deteriorated, the First Italo-Ethiopian War broke out in 1895; Italian troops were defeated as the Ethiopians had numerical superiority, better organization, and support from Russia and France. In 1911, Italy engaged in a war with the Ottoman Empire, in which it acquired Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, that together formed what became known as Italian Libya. In 1919 Enrico Corradini developed the concept of &quot;Proletarian Nationalism&quot;, which was supposed to legitimise Italy&#x27;s imperialism by a mixture of socialism with nationalism:

The Second Italo-Abyssinian War (1935–1936), ordered by the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, was the last colonial war (that is, intended to colonise a country, as opposed to wars of national liberation), occupying Ethiopia—which had remained the last independent African territory, apart from Liberia. Italian Ethiopia was occupied by fascist Italian forces in World War II as part of Italian East Africa though much of the mountainous countryside had remained out of Italian control due to resistance from the Arbegnoch. The occupation is an example of the expansionist policy that characterized the Axis powers as opposed to the Scramble for Africa.

==History and characteristics==

===Colonization before World War I===

====Congo====
David Livingstone&#x27;s explorations, carried on by Henry Morton Stanley, excited imaginations with Stanley&#x27;s grandiose ideas for colonisation; but these found little support owing to the problems and scale of action required, except from Leopold II of Belgium, who in 1876 had organised the International African Association. From 1869 to 1874, Stanley was secretly sent by Leopold II to the Congo region, where he made treaties with several African chiefs along the Congo River and by 1882 had sufficient territory to form the basis of the Congo Free State.
While Stanley was exploring the Congo on behalf of Leopold II of Belgium, the Franco-Italian marine officer Pierre de Brazza travelled into the western Congo Basin and raised the French flag over the newly founded Brazzaville in 1881, thus occupying today&#x27;s Republic of the Congo. Portugal, which also claimed the area because of old treaties with the Kingdom of Kongo, made a treaty with Britain on 26 February 1884 to block off Leopold&#x27;s access to the Atlantic.

By 1890 the Congo Free State had consolidated control of its territory between Leopoldville and Stanleyville and was looking to push south down the Lualaba River from Stanleyville. At the same time, the British South Africa Company of Cecil Rhodes was expanding north from the Limpopo River, sending the Pioneer Column (guided by Frederick Selous) through Matabeleland, and starting a colony in Mashonaland.

Tippu Tip, a Zanzibari Arab based in the Sultanate of Zanzibar, also played a major role as a &quot;protector of European explorers&quot;, ivory trader and slave trader. Having established a trading empire within Zanzibar and neighbouring areas in East Africa, Tippu Tip would shift his alignment towards the rising colonial powers in the region and at the proposal of Henry Morton Stanley, Tippu Tip became a governor of the &quot;Stanley Falls District&quot; (Boyoma Falls) in Leopold&#x27;s Congo Free State, before being involved in the Congo–Arab War against Leopold II&#x27;s colonial state.

To the west, in the land where their expansions would meet, was Katanga, the site of the Yeke Kingdom of Msiri. Msiri was the most militarily powerful ruler in the area and traded large quantities of copper, ivory and slaves—and rumours of gold reached European ears. The scramble for Katanga was a prime example of the period. Rhodes sent two expeditions to Msiri in 1890 led by Alfred Sharpe, who was rebuffed, and Joseph Thomson, who failed to reach Katanga. Leopold sent four expeditions. First, the Le Marinel expedition could only extract a vaguely worded letter. The Delcommune expedition was rebuffed. The well-armed Stairs expedition was given orders to take Katanga with or without Msiri&#x27;s consent. Msiri refused, was shot, and his head was cut off and stuck on a pole as a &quot;barbaric lesson&quot; to the people. The Bia River expedition finished the job of establishing an administration of sorts and a &quot;police presence&quot; in Katanga. Thus, the half million square kilometres of Katanga came into Leopold&#x27;s possession and brought his African realm up to , about 75 times larger than Belgium. The Congo Free State imposed such a terror regime on the colonized people, including mass killings and forced labour, that Belgium, under pressure from the Congo Reform Association, ended Leopold II&#x27;s rule and annexed it on 20 August 1908 as a colony of Belgium, known as the Belgian Congo.
The brutality of King Leopold II in his former colony of the Congo Free State was well documented; up to 8 million of the estimated 16 million native inhabitants died between 1885 and 1908. According to Roger Casement, an Irish diplomat of the time, this depopulation had four main causes: &quot;indiscriminate war&quot;, starvation, reduction of births and diseases. Sleeping sickness ravaged the country and must also be taken into account for the dramatic decrease in population; it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower Congo River. Estimates of the death toll vary considerably. As the first census did not take place until 1924, it is difficult to quantify the population loss of the period. The Casement Report set it at three million. William Rubinstein writes: &quot;More basically, it appears almost certain that the population figures given by Hochschild are inaccurate. There is, of course, no way of ascertaining the population of the Congo before the twentieth century, and estimates like 20 million are purely guesses. Most of the interior of the Congo was literally unexplored if not inaccessible.&quot;

A similar situation occurred in the neighbouring French Congo, where most of the resource extraction was run by concession companies, whose brutal methods, along with the introduction of disease, resulted in the loss of up to 50% of the indigenous population according to Hochschild. The French government appointed a commission headed by de Brazza in 1905 to investigate the rumoured abuses in the colony. However, de Brazza died on the return trip, and his &quot;searingly critical&quot; report was neither acted upon nor released to the public. In the 1920s, about 20,000 forced labourers died building a railroad through the French territory.

====Egypt, Sudan, and South Sudan====

=====Suez Canal=====
To construct the Suez Canal, French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps had obtained many concessions from Isma&#x27;il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt and Sudan in 1854–56. Some sources estimate the workforce at 30,000, but others estimate that 120,000 workers died over the ten years of construction from malnutrition, fatigue, and disease, especially cholera. Shortly before its completion in 1869, Khedive Isma&#x27;il borrowed enormous sums from British and French bankers at high rates of interest. By 1875, he was facing financial difficulties and was forced to sell his block of shares in the Suez Canal. The shares were snapped up by Britain, under Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who sought to give his country practical control in the management of this strategic waterway. When Isma&#x27;il repudiated Egypt&#x27;s foreign debt in 1879, Britain and France seized joint financial control over the country, forcing the Egyptian ruler to abdicate and installing his eldest son Tewfik Pasha in his place. The Egyptian and Sudanese ruling classes did not relish foreign intervention.

=====Mahdist War=====
During the 1870s, European initiatives against the slave trade caused an economic crisis in northern Sudan, precipitating the rise of Mahdist forces. In 1881, the Mahdist revolt erupted in Sudan under Muhammad Ahmad, severing Tewfik&#x27;s authority in Sudan. The same year, Tewfik suffered an even more perilous rebellion by his Egyptian army in the form of the Urabi revolt. In 1882, Tewfik appealed for direct British military assistance, commencing Britain&#x27;s administration of Egypt. A joint British-Egyptian military force entered the Mahdist War. Additionally the Egyptian province of Equatoria (located in South Sudan) led by Emin Pasha was also subject to an ostensible relief expedition of Emin Pasha against Mahdist forces. The British-Egyptian force ultimately defeated the Mahdist forces in Sudan in 1898. Thereafter, Britain seized effective control of Sudan, which was nominally called Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.

====Berlin Conference (1884–1885)====

The occupation of Egypt and the acquisition of the Congo were the first major moves in what came to be a precipitous scramble for African territory. In 1884, Otto von Bismarck convened the 1884–1885 Berlin Conference to discuss the African problem. While diplomatic discussions were held regarding ending the remaining slave trade as well as the reach of missionary activities, the primary concern of those in attendance was preventing war between the European powers as they divided the continent among themselves. More importantly, the diplomats in Berlin laid down the rules of competition by which the great powers were to be guided in seeking colonies. They also agreed that the area along the Congo River was to be administered by Leopold II as a neutral area in which trade and navigation were to be free. No nation was to stake claims in Africa without notifying other powers of its intentions. No territory could be formally claimed before being effectively occupied. However, the competitors ignored the rules when convenient, and on several occasions war was only narrowly avoided (see Fashoda Incident). The Swahili coast territories of the Sultanate of Zanzibar were partitioned between Germany and Britain, initially leaving the archipelago of Zanzibar independent until 1890, when that remnant of the Sultanate was made into a British protectorate with the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty.

====Britain&#x27;s administration of Egypt and South Africa====
Britain&#x27;s administration of Egypt and the Cape Colony contributed to a preoccupation over securing the source of the Nile River. Egypt was taken over by the British in 1882, leaving the Ottoman Empire in a nominal role until 1914, when London made it a protectorate. Egypt was never an actual British colony. Sudan, Nigeria, Kenya, and Uganda were subjugated in the 1890s and early 20th century; and in the south, the Cape Colony (first acquired in 1795) provided a base for the subjugation of neighbouring African states and the Dutch Afrikaner settlers who had left the Cape to avoid the British and then founded their republics. Theophilus Shepstone annexed the South African Republic in 1877 for the British Empire, after it had been independent for twenty years. In 1879, after the Anglo-Zulu War, Britain consolidated its control of most of the territories of South Africa. The Boers protested, and in December 1880 they revolted, leading to the First Boer War. British Prime Minister William Gladstone signed a peace treaty on 23 March 1881, giving self-government to the Boers in the Transvaal. The Jameson Raid of 1895 was a failed attempt by the British South Africa Company and the Johannesburg Reform Committee to overthrow the Boer government in the Transvaal. The Second Boer War, fought between 1899 and 1902, was about control of the gold and diamond industries; the independent Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic were this time defeated and absorbed into the British Empire.

The French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the coasts of West Africa (present-day Senegal) eastward, through the Sahel along the southern border of the Sahara. Their ultimate aim was to have an uninterrupted colonial empire from the Niger River to the Nile, thus controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region by their existing control over the caravan routes through the Sahara. The British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in Southern Africa with their territories in East Africa and these two areas with the Nile basin.
The Sudan (which included most of present-day Uganda) was the key to the fulfilment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This &quot;red line&quot; through Africa is made most famous by Cecil Rhodes. Along with Lord Milner, the British colonial minister in South Africa, Rhodes advocated such a &quot;Cape to Cairo&quot; empire, linking the Suez Canal to the mineral-rich South Africa by rail. Though hampered by the German occupation of Tanganyika until the end of World War I, Rhodes successfully lobbied on behalf of such a sprawling African empire.

Britain had sought to extend its East African empire contiguously from Cairo to the Cape of Good Hope, while France had sought to extend its holdings from Dakar to the Sudan, which would enable its empire to span the entire continent from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. If one draws a line from Cape Town to Cairo (Rhodes&#x27;s dream), and one from Dakar to the Horn of Africa (the French ambition), these two lines intersect somewhere in eastern Sudan near Fashoda, explaining its strategic importance.

A French force under Jean-Baptiste Marchand arrived first at the strategically located fort at Fashoda, soon followed by a British force under Lord Kitchener, commander in chief of the British Army since 1892. The French withdrew after a standoff and continued to press claims to other posts in the region. The Fashoda Incident ultimately led to the signature of the &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot; of 1904, which guaranteed peace between the two.

====Anglo-French Agreement====
In 1890, both the United Kingdom and France were able to reach a diplomatic solution over a colonial dispute that would guarantee freedom of trade for the British Empire while allowing France to expand their influence in North Africa. In exchange for France recognizing Britain&#x27;s protectorate over Zanzibar, the British Empire recognized France&#x27;s claim to Madagascar as well as their sphere of influence in North Africa stretching down to the border region of Sokoto. However, finely demarcating this border was difficult to do without a large map.

====Moroccan Crises====

Although the Berlin Conference had set the rules for the Scramble for Africa, it had not weakened the rival imperialists. As a result of the &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot;, the German Kaiser decided to test the solidity of such influence, using the contested territory of Morocco as a battlefield. Kaiser Wilhelm II visited Tangier on 31 March 1905 and made a speech in favour of Moroccan independence, challenging French influence in Morocco. France&#x27;s presence had been reaffirmed by Britain and Spain in 1904. The Kaiser&#x27;s speech bolstered French nationalism, and with British support, the French foreign minister, Théophile Delcassé, took a defiant line. The crisis peaked in mid-June 1905 when Delcassé was forced out of the ministry by the more conciliation-minded premier Maurice Rouvier. But by July 1905 Germany was becoming isolated, and the French agreed to a conference to solve the crisis.

The 1906 Algeciras Conference was called to settle the dispute. Of the thirteen nations present, the German representatives found their only supporter was Austria-Hungary, which had no interest in Africa. France had firm support from Britain, the U.S., Russia, Italy, and Spain. The Germans eventually accepted an agreement, signed on 31 May 1906, whereby France yielded certain domestic changes in Morocco but retained control of key areas.

However, five years later the Second Moroccan Crisis (or Agadir Crisis) was sparked by the deployment of the German gunboat to the port of Agadir in July 1911. Germany had started to attempt to match Britain&#x27;s naval supremacy—the British navy had a policy of remaining larger than the next two rival fleets in the world combined. When the British heard of the &quot;Panther&quot;″s arrival in Morocco, they wrongly believed that the Germans meant to turn Agadir into a naval base on the Atlantic. The German move was aimed at reinforcing claims for compensation for acceptance of effective French control of the North African kingdom, where France&#x27;s pre-eminence had been upheld by the 1906 Algeciras Conference. In November 1911, a compromise was reached under which Germany accepted France&#x27;s position in Morocco in return for a slice of territory in the French Equatorial African colony of Middle Congo.

France and Spain subsequently established a full protectorate over Morocco on 30 March 1912, ending what remained of the country&#x27;s formal independence. Furthermore, British backing for France during the two Moroccan crises reinforced the &quot;Entente&quot; between the two countries and added to Anglo-German estrangement, deepening the divisions that would culminate in the First World War.

====Dervish resistance====
Following the Berlin Conference, the British, Italians, and Ethiopians sought to claim lands inhabited by the Somalis. The Dervish movement, led by Sayid Muhammed Abdullah Hassan, existed for 21 years, from 1899 until 1920. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat to the coastal region. Because of these successful expeditions, the Dervish movement was recognized as an ally by the Ottoman and German empires. The Turks named Hassan Emir of the Somali nation, and the Germans promised to officially recognise any territories the Dervishes were to acquire. After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay, the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 as a direct consequence of Britain&#x27;s use of aircraft.

====Herero Wars and the Maji Maji Rebellion====


Between 1904 and 1908, Germany&#x27;s colonies in German South West Africa and German East Africa were rocked by separate, contemporaneous native revolts against their rule. In both territories the threat to German rule was quickly defeated once large-scale reinforcements from Germany arrived, with the Herero rebels in German South West Africa being defeated at the Battle of Waterberg and the Maji-Maji rebels in German East Africa being steadily crushed by German forces slowly advancing through the countryside, with the natives resorting to guerrilla warfare.

German efforts to clear the bush of civilians in German South West Africa resulted in a genocide of the population. In total, as many as 65,000 Herero (80% of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Namaqua (50% of the total Namaqua population) either starved, died of thirst, or were worked to death in camps such as Shark Island concentration camp between 1904 and 1908. Between 24,000 and 100,000 Hereros, 10,000 Nama, and an unknown number of San died in the genocide. Characteristic of this genocide was death from starvation, thirst, and possibly the poisoning of the population&#x27;s wells, whilst they were trapped in the Namib Desert.

===Colonial consciousness and exhibitions===

====Colonial lobby====
In its earlier stages, imperialism was generally the act of individual explorers as well as some adventurous merchantmen. The colonial powers were a long way from approving without any dissent the expensive adventures carried out abroad. Various important political leaders, such as William Gladstone, opposed colonization in its first years. However, during his second premiership between 1880 and 1885, he could not resist the colonial lobby in his cabinet and thus did not execute his electoral promise to disengage from Egypt. Although Gladstone was personally opposed to imperialism, the social tensions caused by the Long Depression pushed him to favour jingoism: the imperialists had become the &quot;parasites of patriotism.&quot; In France, Radical politician Georges Clemenceau was adamantly opposed to it: he thought colonization was a diversion from the &quot;blue line of the Vosges&quot; mountains, that is revanchism and the patriotic urge to reclaim the Alsace-Lorraine region which had been annexed by the German Empire with the 1871 Treaty of Frankfurt. Clemenceau made Jules Ferry&#x27;s cabinet fall after the 1885 Tonkin disaster. According to Hannah Arendt in &quot;The Origins of Totalitarianism&quot; (1951), this expansion of national sovereignty on overseas territories contradicted the unity of the nation state which provided citizenship to its population. Thus, a tension between the universalist will respect human rights of the colonized people, as they may be considered as &quot;citizens&quot; of the nation-state, and the imperialist drive to cynically exploit populations deemed inferior began to surface. Some, in colonizing countries, opposed what they saw as unnecessary evils of the colonial administration when left to itself; as described in Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (1899)—published around the same time as Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden&quot;—or in Louis-Ferdinand Céline&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the End of the Night&quot; (1932).

Colonial lobbies emerged to legitimise the Scramble for Africa and other expensive overseas adventures. In Germany, France, and Britain, the middle class often sought strong overseas policies to ensure the market&#x27;s growth. Even in lesser powers, voices like Enrico Corradini claimed a &quot;place in the sun&quot; for so-called &quot;proletarian nations&quot;, bolstering nationalism and militarism in an early prototype of fascism.

====Colonial propaganda and jingoism====
A plethora of colonialist propaganda pamphlets, ideas, and imagery played on the colonial powers&#x27; psychology of popular jingoism and proud nationalism. A hallmark of the French colonial project in the late 19th century and early 20th century was the civilizing mission (&quot;mission civilisatrice&quot;), the principle that it was Europe&#x27;s duty to bring civilisation to benighted peoples. As such, colonial officials undertook a policy of Franco-Europeanisation in French colonies, most notably French West Africa and Madagascar. During the 19th century, French citizenship along with the right to elect a deputy to the French Chamber of Deputies was granted to the four old colonies of Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane and Réunion as well as to the residents of the &quot;Four Communes&quot; in Senegal. In most cases, the elected deputies were white Frenchmen, although there were some black deputies, such as the Senegalese Blaise Diagne, who was elected in 1914.

====Colonial exhibitions====

By the end of World War I the colonial empires had become very popular almost everywhere in Europe: public opinion had been convinced of the needs of a colonial empire, although most of the metropolitans would never see a piece of it. Colonial exhibitions were instrumental in this change of popular mentalities brought about by the colonial propaganda, supported by the colonial lobby and by various scientists. Thus, conquests of territories were inevitably followed by public displays of the indigenous people for scientific and leisure purposes.

Carl Hagenbeck, a German merchant in wild animals and a future entrepreneur of most Europeans zoos, decided in 1874 to exhibit Samoa and Sami people as &quot;purely natural&quot; populations. In 1876, he sent one of his collaborators to the newly conquered Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and Nubians. Presented in Paris, London, and Berlin these Nubians were very successful. Such &quot;human zoos&quot; could be found in Hamburg, Antwerp, Barcelona, London, Milan, New York City, Paris, etc., with 200,000 to 300,000 visitors attending each exhibition. Tuaregs were exhibited after the French conquest of Timbuktu (visited by René Caillié, disguised as a Muslim, in 1828, thereby winning the prize offered by the French &quot;Société de Géographie&quot;); Malagasy after the occupation of Madagascar; Amazons of Abomey after Behanzin&#x27;s mediatic defeat against the French in 1894. Not used to the climatic conditions, some of the indigenous died from exposure, such as some Galibis in Paris in 1892.

Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire, director of the Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation, decided in 1877 to organise two &quot;ethnological spectacles&quot;, presenting Nubians and Inuit. Ticket sales at the Jardin d&#x27;Acclimatation doubled, with a million paying entrances that year, a huge success for these times. Between 1877 and 1912, approximately thirty &quot;ethnological exhibitions&quot; were presented at the zoo. &quot;Negro villages&quot; were presented in Paris&#x27; 1878 World&#x27;s Fair; the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair presented the famous diorama &quot;living&quot; in Madagascar, while the Colonial Exhibitions in Marseille (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) displayed human beings in cages, often nudes or quasi-nudes. Nomadic &quot;Senegalese villages&quot; were also created, thus displaying the power of the colonial empire to all the population.

In the U.S., Madison Grant, head of the New York Zoological Society, exposed Pygmy Ota Benga in the Bronx Zoo alongside the apes and others in 1906. At the behest of Grant, a scientific racist and eugenicist, zoo director William Temple Hornaday placed Ota Benga in a cage with an orangutan and labeled him &quot;The Missing Link&quot; in an attempt to illustrate Darwinism, and in particular that Africans like Ota Benga are closer to apes than were Europeans. Other colonial exhibitions included the 1924 British Empire Exhibition and the 1931 Paris &quot;Exposition coloniale&quot;.

===Countering disease===
From the beginning of the 20th century, the elimination or control of disease in tropical countries became a driving force for all colonial powers. The sleeping sickness epidemic in Africa was arrested through mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk. In the 1880s cattle brought from British Asia to feed Italian soldiers invading Eritrea turned out to be infected with a disease called rinderpest. Decimation of native herds severely damaged local livelihoods, forcing people to labor for their colonizers.

In the 20th century, Africa saw the biggest increase in its population because of lessening of the mortality rate in many countries through peace, famine relief, medicine, and above all, the end or decline of the slave trade. Africa&#x27;s population has grown from 120 million in 1900 to over 1 billion today.

===Slavery abolition===
The continuing anti-slavery movement in Western Europe became a reason and an excuse for the conquest and colonization of Africa. It was the central theme of the Brussels Anti-Slavery Conference 1889–90. From start of the Scramble for Africa, virtually all colonial regimes claimed to be motivated by a desire to suppress slavery and the slave trade. In French West Africa, following conquest and abolition by the French, over one million slaves fled from their masters to earlier homes between 1906 and 1911. In Madagascar, the French abolished slavery in 1896, and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed. Slavery was abolished in the French controlled Sahel by 1911. Independent nations attempting to westernize or impress Europe sometimes cultivated an image of slavery suppression. In response to European pressure, the Sokoto Caliphate abolished slavery in 1900, and Ethiopia officially abolished slavery in 1932. Colonial powers were mostly successful in abolishing slavery, though slavery remained active in Africa, even though it has gradually moved to a wage economy. Slavery was never fully eradicated in Africa.

==Aftermath==
During the New Imperialism period, by the end of the 19th century, Europe added almost – one-fifth of the land area of the globe – to its overseas colonial possessions. Europe&#x27;s formal holdings included the entire African continent except Ethiopia, Liberia, and Saguia el-Hamra, the latter of which was eventually integrated into Spanish Sahara. Between 1885 and 1914, Britain took nearly 30% of Africa&#x27;s population under its control; 15% for France, 11% for Portugal, 9% for Germany, 7% for Belgium and 1% for Italy. Nigeria alone contributed 15 million subjects, more than in the whole of French West Africa or the entire German colonial empire. In terms of surface area occupied, the French were the marginal leaders, but much of their territory consisted of the sparsely populated Sahara.

Political imperialism followed the economic expansion, with the &quot;colonial lobbies&quot; bolstering chauvinism and jingoism at each crisis in order to legitimise the colonial enterprise. The tensions between the imperial powers led to a succession of crises, which exploded in August 1914, when previous rivalries and alliances created a domino situation that drew the major European nations into World War I.

===African colonies listed by colonising power===

====Belgium====

* Belgian Congo (1908–1960, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo)
* Ruanda-Urundi (1922–1962, now Rwanda and Burundi)

====France====


====Germany====
* German Kamerun (now Cameroon and part of Nigeria, 1884–1916)
* German East Africa (now Rwanda, Burundi and most of Tanzania, 1885–1919)
* German South-West Africa (now Namibia, 1884–1915)
* German Togoland (now Togo and eastern part of Ghana, 1884–1914)

After the First World War, Germany&#x27;s possessions were partitioned among Britain (which took a sliver of western Cameroon, Tanzania, western Togo, and Namibia), France (which took most of Cameroon and eastern Togo) and Belgium (which took Rwanda and Burundi).

====Italy====

* Italian Eritrea (1882–1936)
* Italian Somalia (1889–1936)
* Italian Ethiopia (1936–1941)
** &quot;Oltre Giuba&quot; 
* Libya
** Italian Tripolitania (1911–1934)
** Italian Cyrenaica (1911–1934)
** Italian Libya (1934–1943; coastal regions administered as an integral part of Italy itself from 1939–1943)

During the interwar period, Italian Ethiopia formed together with Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland the Italian East Africa (A.O.I., &quot;Africa Orientale Italiana&quot;, also defined by the fascist government as &quot;L&#x27;Impero&quot;).

====Portugal====


On 11 June 1951, Portugal would begin to administer its colonies, including its ones in Africa, as Overseas provinces.

====Spain====


====United Kingdom====


The British were primarily interested in maintaining secure communication lines to India, which led to initial interest in Egypt and South Africa. Once these two areas were secure, it was the intent of British colonialists such as Cecil Rhodes to establish a Cape-Cairo railway and to exploit mineral and agricultural resources. Control of the Nile was viewed as a strategic and commercial advantage. Overall, by 1921, the British had control approximately 33.23% of Africa, or 3,897,920 mi2 (10,09,55,66 km2).

====Independent states====
* Liberia was founded, colonized, established, and controlled by the American Colonization Society, a private organisation established in order to relocate freed African American and Caribbean slaves from the United States and the Caribbean islands in 1822. Liberia declared its independence from the American Colonization Society on July 26, 1847. Liberia is Africa&#x27;s oldest republic and the second-oldest black republic in the world (after Haiti). Liberia maintained its independence during the period as it was viewed by European powers as either a territory, colony or protectorate of the United States.
* The same powers assumed Ethiopia to be a protectorate of Italy although the country had never accepted this, and its independence from Italy was recognized after the Battle of Adwa which resulted in the Treaty of Addis Ababa in 1896. The country remained independent until 1936 when it was occupied by Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini and annexed with Italian-possessed Eritrea and Somaliland, later forming Italian East Africa; in 1941, during World War II, it was occupied by the British Army and its full sovereignty was restored in 1944 after a period of military administration.
* The Sultanate of Aussa existed from the 18th to the 20th century. The Ethiopian Empire nominally laid claim to the region but were met with harsh resistance. Due to their skills in desert warfare, the Afars managed to remain independent. The Sultan Yayyo visited Rome along with countless other nobility from across East Africa to support the creation of Italian East Africa. This marked the end of the region&#x27;s independence and it was disestablished and incorporated into Italian East Africa.
* The Mbunda Kingdom, in present-day southeast Angola, also remained independent during the Scramble for Africa. At its greatest extent, it reached from Mithimoyi in central Moxico to the Cuando Cubango Province in the southeast, bordering Namibia. Portugal declared war on the kingdom in the Kolongongo War, and ultimately conquered it and captured King Mwene Mbandu Lyonthzi Kapova in 1917.
* When Germany established a colony in Namibia in 1884, they left the Ovambo kingdoms undisturbed. After World War I, Namibia was annexed by the South African government into the Union of South Africa; this brought major changes, with South African plantation, cattle breeding and mining operations entering the Ovamboland. The Portuguese colonial administration in Angola, who had previously focused on their coastal, northern and eastern operations, entered southern Angola to form a border with the expanding South African presence. The Ovambo people launched several armed rebellions against South African rule in the 1920s and 1930s, which were all suppressed by the Union Defence Force.
* The Dervish State existed from 1899 until 1920, after successfully repulsing the British Empire four times and forced it to retreat. The Dervish State was the only Muslim state on the African continent to maintain its independence. The Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 after the Somaliland Campaign.
* Egba, a government of the Egba people in Nigeria, was legally recognised by the British as independent until being annexed into the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914.

===Connections to modern-day events===

Anti-neoliberal scholars connect the old scramble to a new scramble for Africa, coinciding with the emergence of an &quot;Afro-neoliberal&quot; capitalist movement in postcolonial Africa. When African nations began to gain independence after World War II, their postcolonial economic structures remained undiversified and linear. In most cases, the bulk of a nation&#x27;s economy relied on cash crops or natural resources. These scholars claim that the decolonisation process kept independent African nations at the mercy of colonial powers by structurally dependent economic relations. They also claim that structural adjustment programs led to the privatization and liberalization of many African political and economic systems, forcefully pushing Africa into the global capitalist market, and that these factors led to development under Western ideological systems of economics and politics.

===Petrostates===
In the era of globalization, several African countries have emerged as petrostates (for example Angola, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Sudan). These are nations with an economic and political partnership between transnational oil companies and the ruling elite class in oil-rich African nations. Numerous countries have entered into a neo-imperial relationship with Africa during this time period. Mary Gilmartin notes that &quot;material and symbolic appropriation of space [is] central to imperial expansion and control&quot;; nations in the globalization era who invest in controlling land internationally are engaging in neocolonialism. Chinese (and other Asian countries) state oil companies have entered Africa&#x27;s highly competitive oil sector. China National Petroleum Corporation purchased 40% of Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company. Furthermore, the Sudan exports 50–60% of its domestically produced oil to China, making up 7% of China&#x27;s imports. China has also been purchasing equity shares in African oil fields, invested in industry related infrastructure development and acquired continental oil concessions throughout Africa.

<text>Lady Victoria Patricia Helena Elizabeth Ramsay (born Princess Patricia of Connaught; 17 March 1886 – 12 January 1974) was a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Upon her marriage to Alexander Ramsay, she relinquished her title of a British princess and the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. She was the third and youngest child and the second daughter of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, and Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia. She was also the only one of her father&#x27;s children to outlive him: her siblings, Margaret and Arthur, both died before their father.

==Early life==

Princess Patricia – &quot;Patsy&quot; to family and friends – was born on 17 March 1886, St Patrick&#x27;s Day, at Buckingham Palace in London. Her father was Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, the third son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her mother was Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia. She had two elder siblings, Prince Arthur of Connaught and Princess Margaret of Connaught, later Crown Princess Margareta of Sweden.

She was baptised &quot;Victoria Patricia Helena Elizabeth&quot; at St Anne&#x27;s Church in Bagshot on 1 May 1886. Her godparents were Queen Victoria (her paternal grandmother); the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (her paternal granduncle, who was represented by her paternal uncle Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein); the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Oldenburg (her maternal aunt); Prince Wilhelm of Prussia (her first cousin, for whom the German Ambassador, Count Hatzfeldt, stood proxy); Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein (her paternal aunt); and Prince Albert of Prussia (her mother&#x27;s first cousin once removed, for whom her maternal uncle the Hereditary Grand Duke of Oldenburg stood proxy). She was named Victoria after Queen Victoria; Patricia, after St Patrick, the saint of her birthday; and Helena, in honour of her father&#x27;s sister Princess Helena of the United Kingdom.

She grew up as a member of the Royal Family. She was a bridesmaid at the wedding of her cousins the Duke and Duchess of York (future King George V and Queen Mary) on 6 July 1893.

==Canada==

Princess Patricia travelled extensively in her early years. Her father, the Duke of Connaught, was posted to India with the army, and the young Princess spent two years living there. Connaught Place, the central business locus of New Delhi, is named for the Duke. In 1911, the Duke was appointed Governor General of Canada. Princess Patricia accompanied her parents to Canada, and she became popular there. Her portrait appears on the one-dollar note of the Dominion of Canada with the issue date 17 March 1917. During this period her mother, the Duchess of Connaught, died in London at Clarence House on 14 March 1917; Princess Patricia inherited £50,000 from her mother&#x27;s estate.

She was named Colonel-in-Chief of Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry on 22 February 1918 and held that appointment until her death. The regiment named for her was privately raised by Andrew Hamilton Gault, of Montreal, at his own expense; it was the last privately raised regiment in the British Empire. Princess Patricia personally designed the badge and colours for the regiment to take overseas to France, and at her wedding in 1919, the regiment attended and played their march specially. As the regiment&#x27;s Colonel-in-Chief, she played an active role until her death.

A memorial plaque in St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Anglican Church in Ottawa is dedicated &quot;To the memory of The Lady Patricia Ramsey, VA, CI, CD late Colonel-in-Chief Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry who as H.R.H. the Princess Patricia of Connaught worshipped here while resident at Government House 1911–1916.&quot;

She was succeeded in 1974 by her cousin and goddaughter Patricia (the Rt. Hon. Lady Brabourne), who became the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, who asked that the men and women of her regiment discount her titles and refer to her in honour of her predecessor as Lady Patricia.

==Marriage==

The question of Patricia&#x27;s marriage was the subject of much speculation in the Edwardian era, as she was considered one of the most beautiful and eligible royal princesses of her generation. She was matched with various foreign royalties, including the King of Spain, the Prince Royal of Portugal, the future Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Grand Duke Michael of Russia, younger brother of Tsar Nicholas II.

In the end, Patricia chose a commoner and married naval Commander (later Admiral) Alexander Ramsay (29 May 1881 – 8 October 1972), one of her father&#x27;s aides-de-camp and third son of the 13th Earl of Dalhousie, at Westminster Abbey on 27 February 1919.

On the occasion of her marriage, Princess Patricia of Connaught was permitted by Royal Warrant to relinquish the style of Royal Highness and the title of Princess of Great Britain and Ireland. She was granted by Royal Warrant of 25 February 1919 the style of Lady Victoria Patricia Helena Elizabeth Ramsay, with special precedence immediately before the Marchionesses of England.

Alexander Ramsay and Patricia had one child:
* Alexander Arthur Alfonso David Maule Ramsay (21 December 1919 – 20 December 2000), who married Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun.

==Later life==

Despite relinquishing her royal title, Lady Patricia remained a member of the British Royal Family, remained in the line of succession, and attended all major royal events, including weddings, funerals, and the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and of Queen Elizabeth II in 1937 and 1953, respectively. She rode in the carriage processions with other members of the Royal Family at the funerals of George V in 1936 and of King George VI. At the coronations, she proceeded in state from Buckingham Palace with other members of the Royal Family and took part in the procession of princes and princesses of the blood royal, attended by a train-bearer and an officer to carry her coronet. She also attended royal garden parties and participated in state visits, her attendance being recorded in the Court Circular together with other members of the Royal Family.

Lady Patricia was an accomplished artist specializing in watercolours. She was made an honorary member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours. Much of her work was inspired by her travel in tropical countries. Her style was influenced by Gauguin and Van Gogh, because she had studied under Archibald Standish Hartrick who had known the artists.

==Death==
Lady Patricia died at Ribsden Holt, Windlesham, Surrey, on 12 January 1974, eight weeks before her 88th birthday and fifteen months after her husband. Probate of her estate was granted in London on 17 April 1974 and it was valued at £917,199 (equivalent to £7 million in 2022).

Lady Patricia and Admiral Alexander Ramsay are buried at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore, directly behind the Royal Mausoleum of her grandparents Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Windsor Great Park.

==Legacy==
A Canadian Army infantry regiment, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, was named in her honour. Patricia Lake in Alberta also carries her name, as does the Patricia Bay Highway in Saanich, British Columbia. There is also a Thamesdown bus named after her in Swindon, Wiltshire.

The second of Canadian Pacific&#x27;s British Columbia Coast Steamships two Fairfield Shipyard-built steam turbo-electric passenger ships, the TEV &quot;Princess Patricia&quot; (&quot;Princess Patricia II&quot;), was named in 1948 for Princess Patricia of Connaught and launched by her as Lady Patricia Ramsay at Govan in that year. The first ship for Princess Cruises via a winter Mexican Riviera charter from CPL in 1965, the ship was retired from Alaskan cruising services in 1981 and served as a floating hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia, for their 1986 World&#x27;s Fair before being finally scrapped in 1989. Her sister ship was the TEV &quot;Princess Marguerite&quot; (II).

The Regina Patricia Hockey Club was named in honour of Princess Patricia, now known as the Regina Pats. Founded in 1917, it is the oldest continuously operating major junior hockey franchise in the world, currently playing as part of the Western Hockey League.

The Patricia Theatre in Powell River, British Columbia, was named in honour of Princess Patricia in 1913. It is the oldest operating theatre in Western Canada.

Two hamlets in Alberta, 10 kilometres apart, are named Princess and Patricia in honour of Princess Patricia. The hamlets were established and named in 1914.

<doc id="286478" wikidata="Q643309" url="?curid=286478" title="Baghdad Battery">
<text>The Baghdad Battery is the name given to a set of three artifacts which were found together: a ceramic pot, a tube of copper, and a rod of iron. It was discovered in present-day Khujut Rabu, Iraq in 1936, close to the ancient city of Ctesiphon, the capital of the Parthian (150 BC – 223 AD) and Sasanian (224–650 AD) empires, and it is believed to date from either of these periods.

Its origin and purpose remain unclear. Wilhelm König, at the time director of the National Museum of Iraq, suggested that the object functioned as a galvanic cell, possibly used for electroplating, or some kind of electrotherapy. There is no electroplated object known from this period, and the claims are universally rejected by archaeologists. An alternative explanation is that it functioned as a storage vessel for sacred scrolls.

Ten similar clay vessels had been found earlier. Four were found in 1930 in Seleucia dating to the Sassanid period. Three were sealed with bitumen and contained a bronze cylinder, again sealed, with a pressed-in papyrus wrapper containing decomposed fiber rolls. They had been held in place with up to four bronze and iron rods sunk into the ground, and their cult meaning and use are inferred. Six other clay vessels were found nearby in Ctesiphon. Some had bronze wrappers with badly decomposed cellulose fibers. Others had iron nails or lead plates.

The artifact disappeared in 2003 during the US-led invasion of Iraq.

== Physical description and dating ==
The artifacts consist of a terracotta pot approximately tall, with a mouth, containing a cylinder made of a rolled copper sheet, which houses a single iron rod. At the top, the iron rod is isolated from the copper by bitumen, with plugs or stoppers, and both rod and cylinder fit snugly inside the opening of the jar. The copper cylinder is not watertight, so if the jar were filled with a liquid, this would surround the iron rod as well. The artifact had been exposed to the weather and had suffered corrosion.

Austrian archeologist Wilhelm König thought the objects might date to the Parthian period, between 250 BC and AD 224. However, according to St John Simpson of the Near Eastern department of the British Museum, their original excavation and context were not well-recorded, and evidence for this date range is very weak. Furthermore, the style of the pottery is Sasanian (224–640).

Albert Al-Haik noted original reports from the 1936 dig at Khuyut Rabbou&#x27;a giving the location as an area northeast of Baghdad, &quot;some two miles off the Baghdad eastern bund.&quot; W. B. Hafford gives context to the discovery of the artifacts in his reaction video to Milo Rossi&#x27;s video on the subject.

== Comparable finds ==
Similar vessels, which can be distinguished primarily by their contents, had previously been found and examined more closely:

Four sealed clay vessels were excavated at Seleucia in 1930 under the archaeological direction of Leroy Waterman, University of Michigan. Three of these finds, dated to the late Sassanid period (5th to 6th centuries AD), were sealed with bitumen. These vessels contained a bronze cylinder, again sealed, with a pressed-in papyrus wrapper. Although writing could not be found on any of these largely decomposed fiber rolls, on the other hand these clay containers had been staked out with up to four metal rods made of bronze and iron sunk into the ground, their cult meaning and use are inferred. The fourth jar, also sealed, contained broken glass.

In 1931, a German-American excavation expedition led by Ernst Kühnel found six more clay vessels in the immediately neighboring Ctesiphon, including three sealed find objects, each with one, three and ten wrapped and sealed bronze rolls. Inside these bronze wraps were already badly decomposed cellulose fibers. Another clay vessel contained three sealed bronze cylinders. In the other two vessels, which were also sealed, there were plates of originally pure lead coated with lead carbonate in a find specimen; in the other ten heavily corroded iron nails, on which traces of a wrapped organic fiber material could be detected.

== Theories concerning operation ==
Its origin and purpose remain unclear. Wilhelm König was an assistant at the Iraq Museum in the 1930s. He had observed a number of very fine silver objects from ancient Iraq, plated with very thin layers of gold, and speculated that they were electroplated. In 1938 he authored a paper offering the hypothesis that they may have formed a galvanic cell, perhaps used for electroplating gold onto silver objects. This interpretation is rejected by archeologists and scientists.

Corrosion of the metal and tests both indicate that an acidic agent such as wine or vinegar was present in the jar. This led to speculation that the liquid was used as an acidic electrolyte solution to generate an electric current from the difference between the electrode potentials of the copper and iron electrodes.

=== Supporting experiments ===

After the Second World War, Willard Gray demonstrated current production by a reconstruction of the inferred battery design when filled with grape juice. W. Jansen experimented with benzoquinone (some beetles produce quinones) and vinegar in a cell and got satisfactory performance. 

In 1978, Arne Eggebrecht, a past director of the Roemer- und Pelizaeus-Museum Hildesheim reportedly reproduced the electroplating of gold onto a small statue. There are no (direct) written or photographic records of this experiment. In an article from the BBC, Dr Bettina Schmitz, a researcher based at the same museum, said, &quot;There does not exist any written documentation of the experiments which took place here in 1978... The experiments weren&#x27;t even documented by photos, which really is a pity...I have searched through the archives of this museum and I talked to everyone involved in 1978 with no results.&quot;

== Controversies over use ==
=== Lack of electrical connections ===

Though the iron rod did project outside of the asphalt plug, the copper tube did not, making it impossible to connect a wire to this to complete a circuit.

=== Electroplating hypothesis ===
König himself seems to have been mistaken on the nature of the objects he thought were electroplated. They were apparently fire-gilded (with mercury). Paul Craddock of the British Museum said &quot;The examples we see from this region and era are conventional gold plating and mercury gilding. There&#x27;s never been any irrefutable evidence to support the electroplating theory&quot;.

David A. Scott, senior scientist at the Getty Conservation Institute and head of its Museum Research Laboratory, writes: &quot;There is a natural tendency for writers dealing with chemical technology to envisage these unique ancient objects of two thousand years ago as electroplating accessories (Foley 1977), but this is clearly untenable, for there is absolutely no evidence for electroplating in this region at the time&quot;.

Paul T. Keyser of the University of Alberta noted that Eggebrecht used a more efficient, modern electrolyte, and that using only vinegar, or other electrolytes available at the time assumed, the battery would be very feeble, and for that and other reasons concludes that even if this was in fact a battery, it could not have been used for electroplating. However, Keyser still supported the battery theory, but believed it was used for some kind of mild electrotherapy such as pain relief, possibly through electroacupuncture.

=== Bitumen as an insulator ===
A bitumen seal, being thermoplastic, would be extremely inconvenient for a galvanic cell, which would require frequent topping up of the electrolyte for extended use.

=== Alternative hypothesis ===
The artifacts are similar to other objects believed to be storage vessels for sacred scrolls from nearby Seleucia on the Tigris. The object was looted along with thousands of other artifacts from the National Museum during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

In March 2012, Professor Elizabeth Stone of Stony Brook University, an expert on Iraqi archaeology, returning from the first archaeological expedition in Iraq after 20 years, stated that she does not know a single archaeologist who believed that these were batteries.

== &quot;MythBusters&quot; TV program ==
The Discovery Channel program &quot;MythBusters&quot; built replicas of the jars to see if it was possible for them to have been used for electroplating or electrostimulation. On &quot;MythBusters&quot;″ 29th episode (23 March 2005), ten hand-made terracotta jars were fitted to act as batteries. Lemon juice was chosen as the electrolyte to activate the electrochemical reaction between the copper and iron. Connected in series, the battery produced 4 volts of electricity. When linked in series, the cells had sufficient power to electroplate a small token and to deliver current to acupuncture type needles for therapeutic purposes, but not enough to deliver an electric shock to &quot;MythBusters&quot; co-host Adam Savage who was instead pranked by co-hosts who hooked him up to a 10,000 volt cattle fence shock generator. Archaeologist Ken Feder commented on the show noting that no archaeological evidence has been found either for connections between the jars (which would have been necessary to produce the required voltage) or for their use for electroplating.

<text>Darby and Joan is a proverbial phrase for a married couple content to share a quiet life of mutual devotion.

==Usage==
&quot;The Nuttall Encyclopædia&quot; defined the phrase as &quot;a married couple celebrated for their mutual attachment&quot;, the &quot;Random House Dictionary&quot; as &quot;a happily married couple who lead a placid, uneventful life.&quot; The &quot;Reader&#x27;s Encyclopedia&quot; mentions the &quot;loving, old-fashioned and virtuous&quot; qualities of Darby and Joan.

== Appearances as a poetic conceit ==
John Darby and his wife Joan were first mentioned in print in a poem published in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; by Henry Woodfall (c. 1686–1747) in 1735, original title &quot;The Joys of Love never forgot. A Song&quot;. Woodfall had been apprentice to Darby, a printer in Bartholomew Close in the Little Britain area of London, who died in 1730. The poem was issued again as a broadsheet in 1748. One stanza of this poem reads:

The apparent popularity of this poem led to another titled &quot;Darby and Joan&quot; by St. John Honeywood (1763–1798):

Lord Byron referred to the old couple in a letter addressed to Francis Hodgson on 8 December 1811:

Frederic Weatherly mentioned the couple in the Victorian era. His poem &quot;Darby and Joan&quot; concludes with the following:

They appear also in &quot;We Have Loved of Yore&quot; from Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Travel and Other Verses&quot;, published in 1896:

== Appearances in popular music ==
Woodfall&#x27;s poem was set to music, as a ballad, by the time of the appearance in 1805 of James Plumptre&#x27;s &quot;Collection of Songs&quot;, where it was #152 in the first volume.

Oscar Hammerstein II and Jerome Kern&#x27;s 1937 ballad &quot;The Folks Who Live On the Hill&quot; mentions Darby and Joan:

The phrase was used satirically by Noël Coward in the song &quot;Bronxville Darby and Joan&quot; from his musical &quot;Sail Away&quot; (1961). The refrain begins, &quot;We&#x27;re a dear old couple and we hate one another.&quot;

A relatively modern music reference to &quot;Darby and Joan&quot; is found in the 1969 pop release of the same name, written and performed by Lyn &quot;Twinkle&quot; Ripley, an English singer-songwriter.

Another even newer reference is in the 2018 song &quot;Darby and Joan&quot; by Australian band The Babe Rainbow.

==Appearances in prose==
Oliver Goldsmith refers to Darby and Joan in his 1773 play, &quot;She Stoops to Conquer or, The Mistakes of a Night. A Comedy&quot; in a conversation between married couple, Hardcastle and Mrs. Hardcastle In Act I, Scene I. Mrs. Hardcastle says, &quot;You may be a Darby, but I&#x27;ll be no Joan, I promise you.&quot;

A reference to Darby and Joan appears in &quot;The Memoirs of Harriette Wilson&quot; (1825), the well-known courtesan whom the Duke of Wellington famously told to &quot;publish and be damned!&quot; Speaking of her tempestuous love–hate relationship with the &quot;little sugar baker&quot; Richard Meyler, she writes wryly:

Why really, Meyler, this plan of free as air, which you know you proposed, is so decidedly to my taste that I cannot sufficiently express to you my obligation. I began to wish, with you, that there was no such thing as constancy in the world, particularly when I recollect how very Darby and Joan-like we lived together in London.

Herman Melville references Darby and Joan in describing the couple Samoa and Annatoo in Chapter 23 of Mardi (1849):

Very often this husband and wife were no Darby and Joan. Their married life was one long campaign, whereof the truces were only by night.

Darby and Joan appear in William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;The History of Henry Esmond&quot; (1852), when the beautiful, spoiled Beatrix taunts Esmond for his seemingly hopeless infatuation with her:

You have not enough money to keep a cat decently after you have your man his wages, and your landlady her bill. Do you think I&#x27;m going to live in a lodging, and turn the mutton at a string whilst your honour nurses the baby? Fiddlestick, and why did you not get this nonsense knocked out of your head when you were in the wars? You are come back more dismal and dreary than ever. You and mamma are fit for each other. You might be Darby and Joan, and play cribbage to the end of your lives.

They appear in Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;Phineas Finn&quot; (Chapter 51, &quot;Troubles at Loughlinter&quot;), published in 1869:

He was disposed to think that the whirlwind had hitherto been too predominant, and had said so very plainly with a good deal of marital authority. This autumn and winter were to be devoted to the cultivation of proper relations between him and his wife. &quot;Does that mean Darby and Joan?&quot; his wife had asked him, when the proposition was made to her.

and there are also several references in Trollope&#x27;s subsequent &quot;The Prime Minister&quot; (1876), when Lady Glencora, Duchess of Omnium, bridles at her husband&#x27;s requests that she put an end to the string of lavish parties she has been throwing to celebrate his selection as the country&#x27;s leader. She dreads his demand that they adopt what she dismissively describes as a &quot;Darby &amp; Joan&quot; existence.

Other references include Henry James&#x27;s &quot;The Bostonians&quot; (1885–1886):

Mrs. Luna said, with her sociable manner, &#x27;There is nothing I like so much, of a winter&#x27;s night, as a cosy tête-à-tête by the fire. It&#x27;s quite like Darby and Joan; what a pity the kettle has ceased singing!&#x27;

and &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (1904):

Their very silence might have been the mark of something grave – their silence eked out for her by his giving her his arm and their then crawling up their steps quite mildly and unitedly together, like some old Darby and Joan who have had a disappointment.

Jerome K. Jerome, in his play &quot;The Passing of the Third Floor Back: An Idle Fancy In a Prologue, A Play, and An Epilogue&quot; (1908) has a character (Mrs. de Hooley) refer ironically to an argumentative couple (Major and Mrs. Tomkins) as &quot;Darby and Joan.&quot;

Wallace Stevens also refers to &quot;young Darby and young Joan&quot; in his essay &quot;Imagination as Value&quot;, from his 1951 book of essays, &quot;The Necessary Angel&quot;.

Ruth Rendell&#x27;s &quot;The Best Man to Die&quot; (1981) has this reference:

My father called my mother darling once or twice and there was a kind of Darby and Joan air about them;

Alan Ayckbourn refers to &quot;Darby and Joan Hepplewick&quot; in his 1982 play &quot;Intimate Exchanges&quot;.

Albert Camus&#x27; translator Stuart Gilbert said &quot;they weren&#x27;t one of those exemplary married couples of the Darby-and-Joan pattern&quot; on page 70 of &quot;The Plague&quot; (Vintage 1991 edition). Camus did not use the phrase himself in &#x27;La Peste&#x27; (1947: 57): &quot;Ce n&#x27;etait même pas un de ces ménages qui offrent au monde l&#x27;exemple d&#x27;un bonheur exemplaire...&quot;

Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Moods&quot; Chapter 14:Why not, if you can bear our quiet life, for we are a Darby and Joan already, though we do not look so to-night, I acknowledge.

== Darby and Joan clubs ==
These were set up by the Women&#x27;s Voluntary Service (WVS) after World War II. The WVS had done sterling work during the Blitz, and wanted to develop what they could offer to older people. They set up day centres called &quot;Darby and Joan clubs&quot;, &quot;where people could meet in pleasant surroundings for a friendly chat and a cup of tea and perhaps a quiet game of cards or half an hour with the wireless [i.e. radio]&quot;; some of these clubs also offered a hot mid-day meal.

<doc id="286485" wikidata="Q255953" url="?curid=286485" title="Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife">
<text>Princess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife (Alexandra Victoria Alberta Edwina Louise Duff; 17 May 1891 – 26 February 1959), born Lady Alexandra Duff and known as Princess Arthur of Connaught after her marriage, was the eldest surviving grandchild of Edward VII and also the first cousin of Edward VIII and George VI. Alexandra and her younger sister, Maud, had the distinction of being the only female-line descendants of a British sovereign officially granted both the title of &quot;Princess&quot; and the style of &quot;Highness&quot;.

==Lineage and early life==

Alexandra&#x27;s father was Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife. Having succeeded his father as the 6th Earl Fife, he was elevated to Duke of Fife and Marquess of Macduff in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on his marriage in 1889 to Princess Louise of Wales, the eldest daughter of the future Edward VII. Princess Louise accordingly became the Duchess of Fife, and succeeded as the head of many Scottish Feudal Baronies, including MacDuff, named for James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife.

Alexandra was born at East Sheen Lodge, Richmond, Surrey, on 17 May 1891. After ten years of marriage and the birth in 1893 of Alexandra&#x27;s younger sister Maud, no more children would be born to Alexandra&#x27;s parents and the dukedom and marquessate of Fife were headed toward extinction since only a male heir could inherit those titles. On 24 April 1900, Queen Victoria granted Alexander Duff a second dukedom of Fife, along with the earldom of Macduff, stipulating by special remainder that these two titles would jointly devolve, in default of sons born to him and the Queen&#x27;s granddaughter, upon their daughters in order of seniority of birth, and upon their respective agnatic male descendants in the same order. After her father&#x27;s death in 1912, therefore, she inherited the Dukedom of Fife in her own right.

As a female-line granddaughter of the British monarch, Alexandra was not entitled to the title of &quot;Princess&quot;, nor to the style of &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot;. Instead she was styled &quot;Lady Alexandra Duff&quot;, as the daughter of a duke, even though she was born fifth in the line of succession to the British throne. Alexandra and her sister were unique among British princesses in that they were descended from both King William IV (through his mistress, Dorothea Jordan), and William IV&#x27;s niece, Queen Victoria, who succeeded him because he left no legitimate issue.

She was baptised at the Chapel Royal, St James&#x27;s Palace on 29 June 1891 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Edward White Benson. Her godparents were Queen Victoria and the Prince and Princess of Wales.

==Princess Alexandra==
On 9 November 1905, King Edward VII declared his eldest daughter Princess Royal. He further ordered Garter King of Arms to gazette Lady Alexandra Duff and her sister Lady Maud Duff with the style and attribute of &quot;Highness&quot; and the style of Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names, with precedence immediately after all members of the British royal family bearing the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. From that point, &quot;Her Highness Princess Alexandra&quot; held her title and rank, not from her ducal father, but from the decree issued by will of the sovereign (her maternal grandfather).

In August 1910, Alexandra became secretly engaged to her first cousin once removed, Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark, a son of King George I of Greece, the brother of her maternal grandmother Queen Alexandra. The engagement was terminated when their disapproving parents learned of the liaison and forbade the union.

In November 1911, Alexandra and her family were travelling by boat to a winter holiday in Egypt when their liner, the P&amp;O&#x27;s &quot;SS&quot; &quot;Delhi&quot;&quot;,&quot; ran aground ashore at Cape Spartel in fog and heavy seas. The passengers were rescued, but the rescue boat also sank. Alexandra was struck by a wave in the face and later wrote that she felt the water rush up her nose and swallowed it in gulps. She was rescued by a doctor who pulled her onto the beach. Her sister and mother also nearly died and her father, Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife, subsequently died as a result of his injuries a few weeks later at Aswan.

==Marriage and issue==
On 15 October 1913, Princess Alexandra married her first cousin, once removed, Prince Arthur of Connaught at the Chapel Royal, St. James&#x27;s Palace, London.

The bride&#x27;s attendants were: 
* Princess Maud, the bride&#x27;s sister.
* Princess Mary of the United Kingdom, the bride&#x27;s maternal first cousin and daughter of King George V.
* Princess Mary of Teck and Princess Helena of Teck, daughters of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Teck (brother of Queen Mary).
* Princess May of Teck, the bride&#x27;s maternal second cousin and daughter of Prince Alexander of Teck (brother of Queen Mary) and Princess Alice of Albany.

Prince Arthur of Connaught was the only son of the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, third son of Queen Victoria and thus a younger brother of her maternal grandfather, King Edward VII. As such, Arthur and Alexandra were first cousins once removed.

After their marriage, Alexandra was referred to as &quot;HRH Princess Arthur of Connaught&quot;, in accordance with the tradition that a wife normally shares the title and style of her husband.

With her husband, Alexandra also carried out royal engagements on behalf of her uncle, King George V, and later for her cousin, King George VI. She also served as a Counsellor of State between 1937 and 1944.

The couple&#x27;s only child, their son Alastair Windsor, 2nd Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, was born on 9 August 1914.

==Nursing career==
World War I gave to Princess Arthur an opportunity to embrace her vocation of nursing in which she subsequently made a successful career. In 1915 she joined the staff of St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington, as a full-time nurse and worked in this capacity until the armistice. After the war she continued her training at St. Mary&#x27;s, becoming a state registered nurse in 1919. She was awarded a first prize for a paper on eclampsia. Princess Arthur also practised at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s Hospital, specialising in gynaecology, where she received a certificate of merit. Throughout these years Princess Arthur increasingly impressed her superiors by her technical skill and practical efficiency.

When her husband was appointed governor-general of the Union of South Africa in 1920, Princess Arthur accompanied him and shared in his popularity. Her tact and friendliness made her friends among the South Africans, who also admired the interest she displayed in hospitals, child welfare, and maternity work throughout the Union. To these subjects she brought her personal knowledge and experience, which enabled her to make effective and valuable suggestions. Despite this, she found life in South Africa restricting.

On her return to London in 1923, Princess Arthur resumed her nursing career at University College Hospital, where she was known as &quot;Nurse Marjorie&quot;, and subsequently at Charing Cross Hospital. At this time she specialised in surgery and worked as a theatre sister. She performed minor operations herself, such as an amputation of a patient&#x27;s thumb. Her services to the nursing profession were recognized in July 1925, when she was awarded the badge of the Royal Red Cross by George V.

The outbreak of World War II in 1939 afforded Princess Arthur further scope for her nursing abilities. She refused the offer of a post as matron of a hospital in the country, preferring to become sister-in-charge of the casualty clearing station of the Second British General Hospital set up to treat the troops retreating from Dunkirk. Shortly thereafter, she opened the Fife Nursing Home in Bentinck Street which she personally equipped, financed, and administered as matron for ten years.

On 26 April 1943 her only child, Alastair, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, died unexpectedly (and in ill-defined circumstances) whilst staying at Rideau Hall in Ottawa with his relative the Governor-General of Canada, the Earl of Athlone.

==Later life and death==

In 1949 the rheumatoid arthritis, from which Princess Arthur had suffered for many years, rendered her bedbound and so necessitated the closing of her nursing home. She retired to her London home at 64 Avenue Road, St John&#x27;s Wood, London where she wrote for private circulation two autobiographical fragments in a vivid and entertaining style: &quot;A Nurse&#x27;s Story&quot; (1955) and &quot;Egypt and Khartoum&quot; (1956), in which she gave a graphic account of the shipwreck of SS &quot;Delhi&quot;. She was engaged on a further volume on big-game hunting in South Africa when she died at home on 26 February 1959.

At her request she was cremated, and her ashes laid in St Ninian&#x27;s Chapel, Braemar, on the Mar Lodge estate alongside her parents&#x27; and son&#x27;s. Her will was sealed in London after her death in 1959. Her estate was valued at £86,217 (or £1.4 million in 2022 when adjusted for inflation).

<text>Philippe Vandevelde, working under the pseudonym Tome (24 February 1957 – 5 October 2019), was a Belgian comics writer. He was known for collaborations with Janry on &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; and &quot;Le Petit Spirou&quot;, and with Luc Warnant and later Bruno Gazzotti on &quot;Soda&quot;. He also collaborated with Ralph Meyer on &quot;Berceuse assassine&quot;, and with Marc Hardy on &quot;Feux&quot;. Earlier in his career he was an assistant-artist for Dupa.

== Biography ==
Vandevelde was born in Brussels. An operation left him blind for a short while at the age of eight. His first experiences of comics were the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; story &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; and &quot;Corentin&quot; read aloud to him. Under the pseudonyms &quot;Phil&quot; and &quot;Tom&quot;, he published his first illustrations and comics for the school magazine &quot;Buck&quot; (made by Thierry Groensteen) from 1972 to 1974. His first comic was a medieval parody &quot;Estrel, le troubadour&quot;.

Tome began his professional comics career in the studio of Dupa, the author of &quot;Cubitus&quot;, where he met Janry who would become a long-time collaborator. After assisting Turk and De Groot on series such as &quot;Léonard&quot; and &quot;Clifton&quot;, they began working at the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Spirou&quot; in 1979, their first assignment being the games page &quot;Jeureka&quot;.

In 1980 they began work on their first &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; adventure, the iconic forty-year-old series of &quot;Spirou&quot;. Previously created by a succession of authors including the famous André Franquin, Tome and Janry were given the task in alternation with another creative team of Nic and Cauvin. Eventually assuming sole responsibility of the series, Tome and Janry continued creating stories until 1998, completing 14 albums, in addition to creating &quot;Le Petit Spirou&quot;, a series about Spirou&#x27;s youth, for which they made 14 albums since 1990.

<text>Jean-Richard Geurts, better known under his pseudonym Janry (born 2 October 1957), is a Belgian comics artist. With Tome he created &quot;Le Petit Spirou&quot; and made several &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot; albums.

==Early life==
Born in Jadotville (now Likasi) in the Belgian Congo (now Democratic Republic of the Congo), he moved to Brussels, Belgium with his parents when he was ten years old, and went to school in Jodoigne. His main hobby at the time was drawing, especially planes and other technological items.

==Career==
In 1974, he took a comics course where he learned to draw figures, and where he met Vandevelde, of the same age and also studying in Jodoigne, although at a different college. They became friends, and attended the same Art Academy in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert studying the making of comics. There they met Stéphane De Becker, and the three together made comics, sharing the roles of author, artists, and colourist, but later they all would more or less specialize, with Janry mainly functioning as the artist.

After his studies, Janry began a professional career by becoming the assistant of Francis for the series &quot;Ford T&quot;, and later assisted Dupa for &quot;Cubitus&quot;. During this period, he also collaborated with Greg and with Turk and Bob de Groot.

Together with Tome, he started working for &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, where they created the games page &quot;Eureka!&quot;, signing as J.R. and PH. They later changed their pseudonyms to Tome (for Philippe Vandevelde, who used Tom from a very early age) and Janry (from Jean-Richard). This was intended as a pun on Tom and Jerry.

In 1981, they started working with the adventures of &quot;Spirou et Fantasio&quot;. This is the title series of &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, in continuous production since 1938 by a succession of authors, most famously André Franquin. The last of those, Jean-Claude Fournier, had left the series at the end of the 1970s, and the magazine was looking for a solution to get the series back in production. Three teams started making stories, but after a few years only Tome and Janry remained. For them, it was a childhood dream, and they showed their first two pilot pages to Franquin to get some advice. They continued making stories until 1998, when after 14 albums they ended their run.

However, in 1988, they began the project &quot;Le Petit Spirou&quot;, a spin-off telling stories from Spirou&#x27;s youth, predominantly in the 1 page format. Since then, they have published 12 albums of this series. After a few years, the series reached a circulation of 500,000 copies for each new album, thus becoming more successful than the original series.

Janry now functions as artist, and Tome as author of the stories, with Stéphane De Becker as colourist.

==Bibliography==

<text>Chang Chong-Chen () is a fictional character in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Although Chang and Tintin only know each other for a short time, they form a deep bond which drives them to tears when they separate or are re-united.

Chang was based on the Chinese artist Zhang Chongren, a real friend of Hergé&#x27;s.

The story that introduced him was to have a major effect on Hergé and &quot;Tintin&quot;, making it one of the most popular series of all time. 

==Character history==

In the process of planning his story, Hergé was contacted by a Father Gosset, chaplain to the Chinese students at Louvain University, who suggested that he do some actual research into life in China as it really was. Hergé agreed and Gosset introduced him to Zhang Chongren, a student at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels.

The two men, both aged 27, got on well and Hergé decided to include his new friend in the story. Zhang supplied much of the Chinese writing that was to feature and told Hergé a lot about Chinese culture, history and drawing techniques. He also gave a detailed description of life in 1930s China, which included the occupation of eastern territories by the Japanese, British and Americans and other Western powers.

The result of their meetings was the 1936 story &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;, a major landmark in the development of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. From that time onwards Hergé would research his subjects thoroughly. He also changed his attitude towards the relationship between native peoples and foreigners. He had previously taken a positive view of imperialism in &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; (published in 1930). Now, in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; (1934-35), he criticised the Japanese occupation of China and featured an event inspired by the Mukden incident. The Shanghai International Settlement, with its racist Western businessmen and corrupt police (which includes White and Sikh officers), was also shown in a bad light.

==Meeting Tintin==

The fictional Chang first appeared in &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; as a young orphan whom Tintin saved from drowning. The first thing he asked was why a white foreigner like Tintin would bother saving a non-white boy at all (Tintin was to cause similar queries when helping Zorrino in &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;). He and Tintin then exchanged notes on the prejudice that Chinese and non-Chinese have for each other and laughed it away. In his description of Western prejudices, Tintin includes a Fu Manchu-like character. (In fact &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; features a Japanese villain called Mitsuhirato.)

They then became friends and Chang led Tintin to Hukow where he was on the trail of a kidnapped doctor. There they stayed with a friend of Chang&#x27;s late father. They later encountered Thomson and Thompson who had arrived dressed as figures out of a Chinese opera and were being followed with amusement by half the population.

Thomson and Thompson had been sent to arrest Tintin and took him to the local police station in order to start extradition proceedings. However, they had lost a document written in Chinese which instructed the local police to give them assistance. Chang replaced the paper with another one which claimed that Thomson and Thompson were &quot;lunatics and this proves it&quot;. When he read the document, the chief of police roared with laughter, then he had Thomson and Thompson thrown out and Tintin released.

Chang also saved Tintin from a Japanese agent dressed as a photographer who had been sent to kill him.

Tintin took Chang with him back to Shanghai in order to settle his scores with his enemy Mitsuhirato. Tintin was staying at the headquarters of the Sons of the Dragon, a secret society that fought against the trafficking of opium. Chang moved in with them and joined in the battle of wits against a major gang of opium smugglers.

Chang played a crucial part in the capture of the leaders of the gang and saving Tintin and others from execution. The crooks included Tintin&#x27;s arch-enemy Rastapopoulos. After that Chang was adopted by Tintin&#x27;s ally Wang Chen-Yee.

Tintin and Snowy then left for Europe amid a tearful and emotional farewell to Chang and his new family.

==Chang and the Yeti==
Chang remained unmentioned in the stories until &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, published 24 years later in 1960. In this story, Chang sends Tintin a letter in which he announces his imminent move from Hong Kong, where he had been living, to London in order to work in an antique shop owned by a brother of Wang&#x27;s. His aeroplane, however, crashes over the mountains of Tibet. Chang survives the disaster while all his fellow passengers perish, and is rescued by the yeti, the mythical creature said to live in the Himalayas. The yeti takes care of Chang, providing him with food, but when rescue arrives, he also takes Chang, weak with fever, as far away as possible.

Tintin is convinced that Chang is not dead, after seeing him in a dream calling for help. Against all logic he sets off to find him, with the grudging help of Captain Haddock who, along with almost everyone else, believes Chang to be deceased.

Tintin and Haddock eventually track Chang and the yeti down to another cave, and manage to get him out, following a tearful reunion.

Although he has to leave him, Chang is very grateful to the yeti for keeping him alive and describes him as &quot;poor snowman&quot;, rather than &quot;abominable&quot;. When Tintin wonders if he might one day be captured, Chang objects to this, feeling that the yeti should be looked upon as a human rather than a wild animal.

Chang later goes to London from where he keeps in touch, sending letters to Tintin and Haddock (see &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;).

&quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; was perhaps Hergé&#x27;s most deeply personal work. When he wrote it, he had not seen the real-life Zhang for several decades. Later, in 1981, the French media managed to find Zhang in China and arrange a trip to Europe for a reunion with Hergé. In 1985, Zhang received French citizenship and settled in Paris to teach, where he died in 1998.

<text>Methotrexate, formerly known as amethopterin, is a chemotherapy agent and immune-system suppressant. It is used to treat cancer, autoimmune diseases, and ectopic pregnancies. Types of cancers it is used for include breast cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, lymphoma, gestational trophoblastic disease, and osteosarcoma. Types of autoimmune diseases it is used for include psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn&#x27;s disease. It can be given by mouth or by injection.
Common side effects include nausea, feeling tired, fever, increased risk of infection, low white blood cell counts, and breakdown of the skin inside the mouth. Other side effects may include liver disease, lung disease, lymphoma, and severe skin rashes. People on long-term treatment should be regularly checked for side effects. It is not safe during breastfeeding. In those with kidney problems, lower doses may be needed. It acts by blocking the body&#x27;s use of folic acid.
Methotrexate was first made in 1947 and initially was used to treat cancer, as it was less toxic than the then-current treatments. In 1956 it provided the first cures of a metastatic cancer. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Methotrexate is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 132nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

===Chemotherapy===
Methotrexate was originally developed and continues to be used for chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with other agents. It is effective for the treatment of several cancers, including solid tumours of breast, head and neck, lung, bladder, as well as acute lymphocytic leukemias, non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, osteosarcoma, and choriocarcinoma and other trophoblastic neoplasms. It is also used in the treatment of aggressive fibromatosis (desmoid tumor).

===Autoimmune disorders===
Although originally designed as a chemotherapy drug, in lower doses methotrexate is a generally safe and well-tolerated drug in the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases.

Methotrexate is used as a disease-modifying treatment for several autoimmune diseases in adults, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthritis, myositis, systemic sclerosis, lupus, sarcoidosis, Crohn&#x27;s disease, and many forms of vasculitis. In children, it can be used for juvenile dermatomyositis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, uveitis and localised scleroderma.

Methotrexate is one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Weekly doses of 5 to 25mg were found by a Cochrane review to be beneficial for 12–52 weeks duration of therapy, though it is used longer-term in clinical practice. Discontinuation rates are as high as 16% due to adverse effects.

Use of low doses of methotrexate together with NSAIDs such as aspirin or analgesics such as paracetamol is relatively safe in people being treated for rheumatoid arthritis, with appropriate monitoring. Methotrexate is also sometimes used in combination with other conventional DMARDs, such as sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine.

Studies and reviews have found that most rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with methotrexate for up to one year had less pain, functioned better, had fewer swollen and tender joints, and had less disease activity overall as reported by themselves and their doctors. X-rays also showed that the progress of the disease slowed or stopped in many people receiving methotrexate, with the progression being completely halted in about 30% of those receiving the drug. Those individuals with rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate have been found to have a lower risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarctions and strokes.

Results of a systematic review exploring the comparative effectiveness of treatments of early rheumatoid arthritis show that treatment efficacy can be improved with combination therapy with anti-TNF or other biologic medications, compared with methotrexate monotherapy.

Likewise, a 2016 study found the use of methotrexate, in combination with anti-TNF agents, is effective for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

Methotrexate has also been used for multiple sclerosis and is used occasionally in systemic lupus erythematosus, with tentative evidence to support such use.

=== Atopic dermatitis ===
Along with other immunosuppressants, methotrexate is used to treat severe atopic dermatitis (eczema).

===During pregnancy===
Methotrexate is an abortifacient and is used to treat ectopic pregnancies, provided the fallopian tube has not ruptured. Methotrexate with dilation and curettage is used to treat molar pregnancy. Rarely, it is used in combination with misoprostol to abort intrauterine pregnancies.

===Administration===
Methotrexate can be given by mouth or by injection (intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intrathecal). Doses are usually taken weekly, not daily, to limit toxicity. Routine monitoring of the complete blood count, liver function tests, and creatinine are recommended. Measurements of creatinine are recommended at least every two months.

Folic acid is commonly co-prescribed with methotrexate to minimise the risk of adverse effects.

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, stomatitis, blood abnormalities (leukopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia), increased risk of infection, hair loss, nausea, reduced appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, acute pneumonitis and renal impairment. Methotrexate can also cause mucositis.

Methotrexate pneumonitis is a rare complication of therapy and appears to be reducing in frequency in most recent rheumatoid arthritis treatment trials. In the context of rheumatoid arthritis interstitial lung disease, methotrexate treatment may be associated with a lower incidence of ILD over time.

Methotrexate is teratogenic and it is advised to stop taking it at least 4 weeks before becoming pregnant and it should be avoided during pregnancy (pregnancy category X) and while breastfeeding. Guidelines have been updated to state that it is safe for a male partner to take at any point while trying to conceive.

Central nervous system reactions to methotrexate have been reported, especially when given via the intrathecal route (directly into the cerebrospinal fluid), which include myelopathies and leukoencephalopathies. It has a variety of cutaneous side effects, particularly when administered in high doses.

Another little-understood but serious possible adverse effect of methotrexate is neurological damage and memory loss. Neurotoxicity may result from the drug crossing the blood–brain barrier and damaging neurons in the cerebral cortex. People with cancer who receive the medication often nickname these effects &quot;chemo brain&quot; or &quot;chemo fog&quot;.

===Drug interactions===
Penicillins may decrease the elimination of methotrexate and increase the risk of methotrexate toxicity. While they may be used together, increased monitoring is recommended. The aminoglycosides neomycin and paromomycin have been found to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of methotrexate. Probenecid inhibits methotrexate excretion, which increases the risk of methotrexate toxicity. Likewise, retinoids and trimethoprim have been known to interact with methotrexate to produce additive hepatotoxicity and haematotoxicity, respectively.

Other immunosuppressants like cyclosporins may potentiate methotrexate&#x27;s haematologic effects, hence potentially leading to toxicity. NSAIDs have also been found to fatally interact with methotrexate in numerous case reports. Nitrous oxide potentiating the haematological toxicity of methotrexate has also been documented.

Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole and the anticonvulsant valproate have been found to increase the plasma concentrations of methotrexate, as have nephrotoxic agents such as cisplatin, the GI drug colestyramine, and dantrolene.

=== Vaccine interactions ===

Taking methotrexate can reduce the effectiveness of vaccinations against various diseases, such as influenza and hepatitis A. It does this by blunting the immune response of the body to the vaccine.

Methotrexate also dampens the immune response to COVID-19 vaccines, making them less effective. Pausing methotrexate for two weeks following COVID-19 vaccination may result in improved immunity. Not taking the medicine for two weeks might result in a minor increase of inflammatory disease flares in some people.

==Mechanism of action==


Methotrexate is an antimetabolite of the antifolate type. It is thought to affect cancer and rheumatoid arthritis by two different pathways. For cancer, methotrexate competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that participates in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis. The affinity of methotrexate for DHFR is about 1000-fold that of dihydrofolate. DHFR catalyses the conversion of dihydrofolate to the active tetrahydrofolate. Tetrahydrofolate is needed for the &quot;de novo&quot; synthesis of the nucleoside thymidine, required for DNA synthesis. Also, folate is essential for de-novo purine base biosynthesis, so synthesis will be inhibited. Methotrexate, therefore, inhibits the synthesis of DNA, RNA, thymidylates, and proteins.

For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibition of DHFR is not thought to be the main mechanism, but rather multiple mechanisms appear to be involved, including the inhibition of enzymes involved in purine metabolism, leading to accumulation of adenosine; inhibition of T cell activation and suppression of intercellular adhesion molecule expression by T cells; selective down-regulation of B cells; increasing CD95 sensitivity of activated T cells; and inhibition of methyltransferase activity, leading to deactivation of enzyme activity relevant to immune system function. Another mechanism of MTX is the inhibition of the binding of interleukin 1-beta to its cell surface receptor. Thereby, it acts as anticytokine.

==History==
In 1947, a team of researchers led by Sidney Farber showed aminopterin, a chemical analogue of folic acid developed by Yellapragada Subbarao of Lederle, could induce remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The development of folic acid analogues had been prompted by the discovery that the administration of folic acid worsened leukaemia, and that a diet deficient in folic acid could, conversely, produce improvement; the mechanism of action behind these effects was still unknown at the time. Other analogues of folic acid were in development, and by 1950, methotrexate (then known as amethopterin) was being proposed as a treatment for leukemia. Animal studies published in 1956 showed the therapeutic index of methotrexate was better than that of aminopterin, and clinical use of aminopterin was thus abandoned in favor of methotrexate.

In 1951, Jane C. Wright demonstrated the use of methotrexate in solid tumors, showing remission in breast cancer. Wright&#x27;s group was the first to demonstrate use of the drug in solid tumors, as opposed to leukemias, which are a cancer of the marrow. Min Chiu Li and his collaborators then demonstrated complete remission in women with choriocarcinoma and chorioadenoma in 1956, and in 1960 Wright et al. produced remissions in mycosis fungoides.

<text>A calypsonian, originally known as a &quot;chantwell&quot;, is a musician from the anglophone Caribbean who sings songs of the calypso genre. 

Calypsos are musical renditions having their origins in the West African griot tradition. Originally called &quot;Kaiso&quot; in Trinidad, these songs, based on West African Yoruba, Ewe-Fon and Akan musical beats, were sung by slaves and later ex-slaves in Trinidad and Tobago during recreation time and about a host of topics – their land of origin, social relationships on the plantations and the lives of community members, including plantation managers, overseers and owners.

Traditionalists see calypso as social commentary because in earlier years it served the purpose of telling stories, relaying news events and giving criticisms of persons and policy. Calypso was therefore divided into two classes: the social commentaries, which had songs dealing with politics and community issues; and the humorous calypso, which told stories of events, real or imagined, with the intent of making the audience laugh.

By the late 19th century the British began large-scale immigration projects, mainly from Barbados, in an effort to anglicise Trinidad, which resulted in a decline in the use of French Creole in the songs so that by the 1930s English Creole became the language of Trinidad Calypso. Despite the changeover, many words and expressions survived in Trinidad Creole and as a result also survived in its calypsos, including terms such as &quot;santimanitay&quot; from the original &quot;sans humanité&quot;, among others.

Trinidad became the mecca of calypso in part because it was the most prosperous territory in the region and consequently many migrants headed to the island during the 20th century, including performers. As a direct result, Trinidad became known as the land of calypso. 

Many early kaiso/calypsos were sung in French Creole, as Trinidad gained a significant number of free and enslaved blacks from the French Antilles of Martinique, Guadeloupe, French-dominated Grenada and Dominica following the Cedula of population of 1783. The patois or French creole was the original language of the calypsonian and calypso music.

==Origin==
Calypso music was developed in Trinidad in the 17th century from the West African kaiso and canboulay music brought by African slaves imported to that Caribbean island to work on sugar plantations. They were stripped of all connections to their homeland and family and not allowed to talk to each other. African &quot;griots&quot; (musicians and storytellers) among the slaves used calypso song to mock the slave-masters and to communicate with each other. As calypso developed, the African &quot;griots&quot; became later-generation &quot;chantuelles&quot; or &quot;chantwells&quot; preserving their people&#x27;s history and traditions orally, a role that would eventually develop into that of the modern calypsonian. 

=== Chantwells ===
The Chantwells would sing of contemporary and mythical figures. They would also preserve the complex oral traditions of their West African origins, with songs of derision, praise, satire, and lament. At first, the chantwells were mostly women because the males were targeted for destruction on the plantation. Upon emancipation, the tradition continued and developed, and chantwells would sing call-and-response chants called &quot;&quot;, sometimes lionizing and cheering on locals sportsmen such as stick-fighters, with the chantwell giving the call and the audience providing the response. This form of music gradually evolved into the modern calypso. As the country became urbanized, chantwells became more and more a male function. 

=== Social commentary, extempo, competitions ===
Traditionalist see calypso as social commentary because in earlier years it served the purpose of telling stories, relaying news events and giving criticisms of persons and policy. Calypso was therefore divided into two classes: the social commentaries, which had songs dealing with politics and community issues; and the humorous calypso, which told stories of events, real or imagined, with the intent of making the audience laugh. 

The latter form was supplemented by the extempo, which was a singing competition between two competitors. In classic extempo, competitors were pitted against one another, hurling insults in verse about each competitor&#x27;s appearance, singing ability or personal situation.

Extempo competitions and the Calypso Monarch championship are held during Carnival time in Trinidad. The extempo competitions have developed so that competitors choose a topic from a container and are given a designated period of time to compose an agreed number of verses to be sung. A performer sings one verse and then his competitor is allowed to reply, either by responding to the verse sung or by singing about his competitor. Verses about competitors, which may range from insults about their attire to derogatory comments on physical attributes, form part of what Trinidadians term , where someone is allowed to insult another for fun. In this respect, the form is similar to that of the rap battle.

The major difference between a calypsonian and a calypso singer is that a true calypsonian writes his/her own material, and sings topical music that reflects the reality of the community, an example being Attila the Hun, whereas a calypso singer will tend to sing standards, an example being Ritchie Delamore. Some calypsonians both compose and sing their calypsoes while many calypsonians in more recent decades have turned to professional composers, some being fellow calypsonians, for songs that they in turn sing.

== Sobriquets ==
Calypsonians traditionally use sobriquets linked with the ideas they wish to convey or referencing childhood or community-based &quot;nick-names&quot;, including some such as the Mighty Sparrow, Short Shirt of Antigua and Ras Irie of Barbados. Lord Melody, for example, wished to indicate that he was the lord of melodious singing, while King Obstinate of Antigua gained his name as a young man in his home village of Greenbay, where people declared his attitude to be stubborn. The political calypsonian Sugar Aloes of Trinidad through his name conveys two almost opposite aspects of his character: that while his singing, and perhaps he himself, may be sweet, his calypsoes are so scathing as to be bitter for those about whom he sings.

<text>Ashdod (, ; , , or ; Philistine: , *&quot;ʾašdūd&quot;) is the sixth-largest city in Israel. Located in the country&#x27;s Southern District, it lies on the Mediterranean coast south of Tel Aviv and north of Ashkelon. Ashdod&#x27;s port is the largest in Israel, handling 60% of the country&#x27;s imported goods.

Ashdod has a history spanning approximately 3,700 years. In ancient times, Ashdod developed as an active maritime trade center, with its ports identified at Ashdod-Yam and Tel Mor. The remains of the ancient city and later settlements are located at Tel Ashdod. In biblical times, it was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines. The city&#x27;s name was later preserved in the Arab town of Isdud, which was depopulated during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

Modern Ashdod was established in 1956 on the sand hills, 6 kilometers northwest of the ancient site. It was incorporated as a city in 1968, with a land-area of approximately . Being a planned city, expansion followed a main development plan, which facilitated traffic and prevented air pollution in the residential areas, despite population growth. Alongside the port, the city hosts additional national infrastructure, making it an important industrial center. Dr. Yehiel Lasri has been the mayor of Ashdod since 2008. The city is a member of the Forum of 15 cities.

Since its establishment, Ashdod has absorbed extensive Jewish immigration from around the world, resulting in one of the highest percentages of new immigrants in Israel. The city is home to the largest Moroccan and Karaite Jewish communities in Israel, and to the largest Georgian Jewish community in the world. According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, Ashdod had a population of in , with an area of . 

==History==
===Stone Age===
Three stone tools dating from the Neolithic era were discovered, but no other evidence of a Stone Age settlement in Ashdod was found, suggesting that the tools were deposited there in a later period.

===Historical Ashdod and Ashdod-Yam===
The historical town of Ashdod (today referred to as Tel Ashdod / Isdud), was c. 6 km southeast of the center of the modern town. It dates to the 17th century BCE, and was a prominent Philistine city, one of the five Philistine city-states. The coastal site of Ashdod-Yam, today southwest of the modern city, was a separate city for most of its history.

The first documented urban settlement at Tel Ashdod / Isdud dates to the 17th century BCE, when it was a fortified Canaanite city. It was destroyed at the end of the Late Bronze Age.

During the Iron Age, it was a prominent Philistine city, one of the five Philistine city-states. It is mentioned 13 times in the Hebrew Bible. After being captured by Uzziah, it was briefly ruled by the Kingdom of Judah before it was taken by the Assyrians. During the Persian period, Nehemiah condemned the returning Jews for intermarrying Ashdod&#x27;s residents. Under Hellenistic rule, the city was known as &quot;Azotus&quot;. It was later incorporated into the Hasmonean kingdom. During the 1st century BCE, Pompey removed the city from Judean rule and annexed it to the Roman province of Syria. Ashdod was a bishopric under Byzantine rule, but its importance gradually slipped and by the Middle Ages it was a village. 

Ashdod-Yam, later known as Azotos Paralios, appears to have been first settled in the Bronze Age, gradually gaining in importance through the Iron Age. In the Byzantine period the port town overshadowed in importance the city further inland: the bishops of Azotos present at the council of 325 and the council of Jerusalem in 536 seem to have resided in Azotos Paralios rather than in Azotos Mesogeios. The prominence of Hellenised, then Christian Azotus continued until the 7th century, when it came under Muslim rule. The city was represented at the Council of Chalcedon by Heraclius of Azotus. A coastal fort &quot;Minat al-Qal&#x27;a&quot; (lit. &quot;the port with the castle&quot; in Arabic) was erected by the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik, the builder of the Dome of the Rock, at or near the former Azotus Paralios, which was later reconstructed by the Fatimids and Crusaders. The port city stops being mentioned during the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, making it likely that it was destroyed due to fears that they might again be used by Crusader invasions from the sea.

===Isdud before 1948===
Isdud was to be part of the Arab Palestinian state according to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, but Egyptians defending Isdud withdrew in late 1948, causing most of Isdud&#x27;s roughly 5,000 residents to flee. The 300 townspeople who remained were driven southwards by the Israel Defense Forces.
===Foundation of modern Ashdod===
The modern city of Ashdod was founded in 1956. On May 1, 1956, then finance minister Levi Eshkol approved the establishment of the city of Ashdod. &quot;Ashdod Company Ltd.&quot;, a daughter company of City-Builders Company Ltd., was created for that purpose by Oved Ben-Ami and Philip Klutznick.
The first settlers, 22 families from Morocco, arrived in November 1956, followed by a small influx of immigrants from Egypt.

In July 1957, the government granted a , approximately from Tel Aviv, to the Ashdod Company Ltd., for building the modern city of Ashdod. The building of the Eshkol A power station in Ashdod was completed in 1958 and included 3 units: 2 units of 50 megawatt, and one unit of 45 megawatt (with sea water desalination capabilities).

The city&#x27;s development was made possible by the large investment of industrialist Israel Rogosin who opened his main Israeli factory in the city of Ashdod on August 9, 1960. Three of the high schools he funded were also built in Ashdod. The Main boulevard in Ashdod is named in his honour as a founder of the city.

The first local council was appointed in October 1959. Dov Gur was appointed the first local council head on behalf of the Israeli Ministry of Interior. In 1961, Ashdod was a town of 4,600. The Magistrates&#x27; Court in the city was inaugurated in 1963. The building of the port of Ashdod began in April 1961. The port was inaugurated in November 1963, and was first utilized in November 1965, with the coming of the Swedish ship &quot;Wiengelgad&quot;. The city expanded gradually, with the construction of two quarters in the 1960s, followed by four more in the 1970s and two more in the 1980s. In 1972, the population was 40,300, and this grew to 65,700 by 1983.

Large-scale growth of the city began in 1991, with the massive arrival of immigrants from the Soviet Union and Ethiopia and infrastructure development. From 1990 to 2001 the city accepted more than 100,000 new inhabitants, a 150% growth. Five more quarters of the city were completed, and a business district was built. In the 2000s, three more quarters and the marina districts were completed.

Ashdod was one of six cities that won the 2012 Education Prize awarded by the Israel Ministry of Education.

== Urban development ==
The modern city of Ashdod city was built outside the historic settlement site, on virgin sands. The development followed a main development plan. The planners divided the city into seventeen neighborhoods of ten to fifteen thousand people. Wide avenues between the neighborhoods make traffic flow relatively freely inside the city. Each neighborhood has access to its own commercial center, urban park, and health and education infrastructure. The original plan also called for a business and administrative center, built in the mid-1990s, when the city population grew rapidly more than doubling in ten years.

Three industrial zones were placed adjacent to the port in the northern part of the city, taking into account the prevailing southern winds which take air pollution away from the city. The plan had its problems, however, including asymmetric growth of upscale and poorer neighborhoods and the long-time lack of a main business and administrative center.

The city was planned for a maximum of 250,000 inhabitants, and an additional area in the south was reserved for further development.

In 2012, a plan to build an industrial zone on part of the Ashdod Sand Dune was approved. The plan calls for a hi-tech industrial park, events halls, and coffee shops to be built adjacent to the train station. It will cover , including 130 dunams of built-up space, with the rest of the area being preserved as a nature reserve. In addition, the Port of Ashdod is undergoing a massive expansion program.

==Geography==
The Ashdod-Nitzanim sand dune nature reserve is a stretch of sand dunes on the southern outskirts of Ashdod.

== Climate ==
Ashdod has a Mediterranean climate with hot summers, and cool, rainy winters. As a seaside town, the humidity tends to be high many times year round, and rain occurs mainly from November to March. In winter, temperatures seldom drop below and are more likely to be in the range of , while in summer the average is . The average annual rainfall is .

== Economy ==


Ashdod is one of the most important industrial centers in Israel. All industrial activities in the city are located in northern areas such as the port area, the northern industrial zone, and around the Lachish River. The port of Ashdod is the largest port in Israel, handling about 60% of Israel&#x27;s port cargo. It was mainly upgraded in recent years and will be able to provide berths for Panamax ships. Various shipping companies offices are also located in the port area which also is home to an Eshkol A power station and coal terminal.

The Northern industrial zone is located on Highway 41 and includes various industry including an oil refinery, which is one of only two in the country. The heavy industry zone located south of the Lachish River was once the main industrial center in Ashdod. Recently, however, leisure facilities have moved into the area. There is still some industry here, however, such as a Teva Pharmaceutical Industries plant, construction components producer Ashtrom, and Solbar a soybean oil producer. Ashdod is also home to Elta, a part of Israel Aircraft Industries where radar equipment, electronic warfare systems, and ELINT are developed.

==Retail and entertainment==
Historically each neighborhood of Ashdod had its own commercial center. In 1990, however, when the mall shopping culture developed in Israel, the main commercial activity in Ashdod moved to malls. The first mall to open in Ashdod was the Forum Center in the industrial zone. Restaurants, bars and night clubs were opened in the area. Today, the Forum center is mainly used for offices. Lev Ashdod Mall, which opened in 1993, has been enlarged and upgraded since then. Ashdod Mall, billed at the time as the city&#x27;s largest shopping mall, has also been redesigned since its opening in 1995. City Mall, Ashdod was opened in a combined building with the central bus station in 1996, following the examples of the Tel Aviv Central Bus Station and the Jerusalem Central Bus Station. The Sea Mall, a three-story mall near the government offices, has a climbing wall and movie theater. Star Center doubled in size in 2007.

==Education==

Lycée français Guivat-Washington, a French international high school, is in Givat Washington, in proximity to Ashdod.

==Healthcare==
Assuta Ashdod Medical Center, Ashdod&#x27;s only general hospital, serves the city and the surrounding area. It is a 300-bed hospital, and its &quot;bomb shelter&quot; design with thick concrete walls offers sufficient protection so as to keep operating without having to transfer patients during a time of war. It is also a university hospital affiliated with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The hospital opened in 2017. Prior to the opening of the hospital, Ashdod did not have a general hospital, and residents in need of hospitalization had to travel to Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot or Barzilai Medical Center in Ashkelon.

There are public and private clinics operating in the city. A special clinic run by Hatzalah operates at times when all other clinics in the city are closed.

== Transportation ==

=== Road ===

Ashdod is located on the historic Via Maris. Highway 4 was developed following this route along the southern sea shore of Israel; it serves as the main connection to the north, towards the Tel Aviv metropolitan area, and to the south, towards Ashkelon. Ad Halom junction was planned as the main entrance to the city from the east.

Ashdod Interchange was opened in 2009.
The interchange continues the freeway section of Highway 4 further south, by removing the traffic light at this junction, and also added grade separation with the railway. The other main road in the area is Highway 41 which served the city from the start of its modern history. This road runs from west to east towards Gedera and it is the main transport link to the port of Ashdod and the industrial zones, and connects to Highway 4 with an interchange.

In late 2012, Ashdod won a NIS 220 million grant from the MOT to improve public transportation and decrease private car use. by opening exclusive bus lanes along the main boulevards of the city, establishing a BRT system, smart bus stops equipped with touch screens and paving cycling and pedestrians-only lanes. In August 2019, the initial stage of the program, which was named &#x27;Reway&#x27; was completed — with bus lanes established in Menachem Begin and Herzl boulevards. In early 2022, the second stage was completed too — adding bus lanes on Jabotinsky boulevard, commencing operation of the Reway control center and opening the Bnei Brit bus terminal at north.

=== Train ===


The passenger railway connection to Ashdod opened in 1992 after the renovation of the historical railway to Egypt. Ashdod railway station is on Israel Railways&#x27; Binyamina/Netanya – Tel Aviv – Ashkelon line and it is located near Ad Halom Junction. The station was upgraded in 2003 when a new terminal building was built. The station building is modern, but proper road access to it was only organized on September 23, 2008, when a new road to the station was opened.

There is also heavy freight traffic in the area. Port of Ashdod has its own railway spur line as well as a special terminal for potash brought from the Sodom area and exported abroad.

=== Buses ===
A new central bus station opened in 1996. It serves as the terminus both for inter- and intracity lines. The central bus station is attached to the City Mall. Intercity bus lines connect the city with most population centers in central and southern Israel. Following is the list of bus companies serving routes at the central bus station:
===Cruise ships and yachts===

The annual population growth rate is 2.6% and the ratio of women to men is 1,046 to 1,000. The population age distribution was recorded as 19.7% under the age of 10, 15.7% from age 10 to 19, 14.9% from 20 to 29, 19.1% from 30 to 44, 19.1% from 45 to 64, and 11.3% were 65 or older. The population of Ashdod is significantly younger than the Israeli average because of the large number of young couples living in the city. The city is ranked medium-low in socio-economic grading, with a rating of 4 out of 10. 56.1% of 12th grade students in Ashdod were eligible for matriculation certificates in 2000. The average salary in 2000 was NIS 4,821 compared to the national average of NIS 6,835.

===Immigrant absorption===

Ashdod has seen much of its growth as the result of absorption of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of immigrants from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from the former Soviet Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city&#x27;s population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from the former Soviet Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a large number of Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a large number of immigrants from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.

Over 95% of Ashdod&#x27;s population is Jewish, over 30% of Ashdod&#x27;s population are Haredi. The Haredi population has been growing in Ashdod, and Haredi children make up the majority in the city&#x27;s schools. 

The rapidly increasing Haredi population has caused some social and community tensions, particularly regarding the city&#x27;s character, Mayor Lasri levying fines against retail stores if they are open on Shabbat, and growing community tensions with secular Russian Jews. 

Despite this, the city is generally secular, although most of the non-Jewish population is a result of mixed marriages. About 100 families are affiliated with the Pittsburg Hasidic group, established there in 1969 by Grand Rabbi Avraham Abba Leifer and continued today by his son, Grand Rabbi Mordechai Yissachar Ber Leifer. Ashdod has many synagogues serving different streams of Judaism. The city is also home to the world&#x27;s largest Karaite community, about five thousand strong. There is also a Scandinavian Seamen Protestant church, established by Norwegian Righteous Among the Nations pastor Per Faye-Hansen.

<text>A dissident is a person who actively challenges an established political or religious system, doctrine, belief, policy, or institution. In a religious context, the word has been used since the 18th century, and in the political sense since the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of authoritarian governments in countries such as Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, Francoist Spain, the Soviet Union (and later Russia), Saudi Arabia, North Korea, Turkey, Iran, China, and Turkmenistan. In the Western world, there are historical examples of people who have been considered and have considered themselves dissidents, such as the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza. In totalitarian countries, dissidents are often incarcerated or executed without explicit political accusations, or due to infringements of the very same laws they are opposing, or because they are supporting civil liberties such as freedom of speech.

==Eastern Bloc==
The term &quot;dissident&quot; was used in the Eastern Bloc, particularly in the Soviet Union, in the period following Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death until the fall of communism. It was attached to citizens who criticized the practices or the authority of the communist party. Writers for the non-censored, non-conformist &quot;samizdat&quot; literature were criticized in the official newspapers. Soon, many of those who were dissatisfied with Eastern Bloc regimes began to self-identify as dissidents. This radically changed the meaning of the term: instead of being used in reference to an individual who opposes society, it came to refer to an individual whose non-conformism was perceived to be for the good of the society. In Hungary, the word &quot;disszidens&quot; was used in contemporary language for a person who had left for the West without permission (i.e. a defector), by illegally crossing the border or travelling abroad with a passport, but not returning and (sometimes) applying for asylum abroad. Such persons&#x27; citizenship was usually revoked, and their left behind property (if there was any to their name) would revert to the state.

===Soviet===


Soviet dissidents were people who disagreed with certain features in the embodiment of Soviet ideology and who were willing to speak out against them. The term &quot;dissident&quot; was used in the Soviet Union in the period following Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death until the fall of communism. It was used to refer to small groups of marginalized intellectuals whose modest challenges to the Soviet regime met protection and encouragement from correspondents. Following the etymology of the term, a dissident is considered to &quot;sit apart&quot; from the regime. As dissenters began self-identifying as &quot;dissidents&quot;, the term came to refer to an individual whose non-conformism was perceived to be for the good of a society.

Political opposition in the USSR was barely visible and, with rare exceptions, of little consequence. Instead, an important element of dissident activity in the Soviet Union was informing society (both inside the Soviet Union and in foreign countries) about violation of laws and of human rights. Over time, the dissident movement created vivid awareness of Soviet Communist abuses.

Soviet dissidents who criticized the state faced possible legal sanctions under the Soviet Criminal Code and faced the choice of exile, the mental hospital, or penal servitude. Anti-Soviet political behavior, in particular, being outspoken in opposition to the authorities, demonstrating for reform, or even writing books – was defined as being simultaneously a criminal act (e.g., violation of Articles 70 or 190–1), a symptom (e.g., &quot;delusion of reformism&quot;), and a diagnosis (e.g., &quot;sluggish schizophrenia&quot;).

===Czechoslovak===
Czechoslovak dissidents became significant after the 1948 Communist coup and especially after the Warsaw Pact invasion, which ended the liberalizing moment of the Prague spring and led to much of the elite being removed from political and intellectual positions. In the ensuing era of normalization, the unlikely dissident union of former Communists, counter-cultural youth and Christians formed a so-called underground or &#x27;parallel&#x27; culture. This underground created Charter 77 and related movements, eventually meeting success in the Velvet Revolution, in which the formerly imprisoned writer and Charter 77 spokesperson Václav Havel became a key political leader.

==Myanmar==
Aung San Suu Kyi is a famous Myanmar dissident who also won the Nobel Peace Prize.

==Western Europe==
===Ireland===

The term &quot;dissident&quot; has become the primary term to describe Irish republicans who politically continue to oppose Good Friday Agreement of 1998 and reject the outcome of the referendums on it. These political parties also have paramilitary wings which espouse violent methods to achieve a United Ireland.

Irish republican dissident groups include the Irish Republican Socialist Party (founded in 1974 – its currently-inactive paramilitary wing is the Irish National Liberation Army), Republican Sinn Féin (founded in 1986 – its paramilitary wing is the Continuity IRA), and the 32 County Sovereignty Movement (founded in 1997 – its paramilitary wing is the Real IRA). In 2006 the Óglaigh na hÉireann emerged, which is a splinter group of the Continuity IRA.

=== United Kingdom ===
Mark Smith was a mid-level British diplomat, who resigned as a counter-terrorism official at the British embassy in Dublin. He was protesting against the sale of British weapons to Israel and said that &quot;the state of Israel is perpetrating war crimes in plain sight&quot;.

== United States of America ==
Stacy Gilbert, who served in the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration resigned in protest because of a report that she contributed to was falsified by the Biden administration. She said that the report falsely stated that Israel was not blocking humanitarian aid to Gaza.

== Technology ==
Dissidents and activists were among the earliest adopters of encrypted communications technology such as Tor and the dark web, turning to the technology as ways to resist totalitarian regimes, avoid censorship and control and protect privacy.

Tor was widely used by protestors against the Mubarak regime in Egypt in 2011. Tor allowed Egyptian dissidents to communicate anonymously and securely, while sharing sensitive information. Also, Syrian rebels widely used Tor in order to share with the world all of the horrors that they witnessed in their country. Moreover, anti-government dissidents in Lebanon, Mauritania, as well as other nations affected by the Arab Spring, widely used Tor in order to stay safe while exchanging their ideas and agendas.

==West Asia==
===Saudi Arabia===
Jamal Khashoggi was a Saudi American dissident and journalist. He was murdered inside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul by agents of the Saudi government, allegedly at the behest of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Various other human rights activists from Saudi Arabia have been either silenced or punished. This also happens if the individual lives outside the country. If a dissident is not a Saudi citizen, they will probably face deportation.

The Fact Finding Panel (FFP), an independent jury of British parliamentary members and international attorneys, was tasked with reviewing the detention of former Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Nayef and Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz. In mid-December 2020, the panel published a report stating its findings, which claimed that the collective detention of political prisoners by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a violation of the country&#x27;s international legal obligations, as the authorities are holding the detainees without charge and not allowing them a chance to challenge their imprisonment. The imprisonment has also risked the safety of the detainees by posing fatal risks to their health by keeping them behind bars without providing proper medical aid amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Bahrain ===
Another monarchy of the Middle East, Bahrain, is known for violating the rights of peaceful critics of the government, including political activists and human rights defenders. A report released by &quot;Amnesty International&quot; in 2017 revealed that the country opted for several repressive tactics, including arbitrary detention, torture and harassment between June 2016 and June 2017 to crush the dissidents. Several human rights organizations and international leaders have consistently denounced Bahrain&#x27;s poor human rights records.

The &quot;Human Rights Watch World Report 2021&quot; also highlighted that Bahrain continued its repressive actions against the dissidents, including acts against online activities, peaceful critics and opposition activists. In January 2021, forty cross-party MPs of the UK wrote a letter to the vice-chancellor of an educational institution, the University of Huddersfield, stating that it was at risk of “indirect implication in human rights abuse”. The university was running a master&#x27;s course, MSc in security science, for the officers of Bahrain&#x27;s Royal Academy of Policing, the building which was also being used for torturing dissidents.

In April 2021, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Bahrain, especially concerning the cases of detained dissidents Nabeel Rajab, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and Ibrahim Sharif. With 48 votes in favor, the MEPs condemned Bahrain for its human rights violations and called for an immediate release of all the political activists, prisoners in conscience, human rights defenders, journalists and peaceful protesters. The European Parliament also demanded that the Bahraini government take all necessary measures to respect the law and make sure that its actions remain in full compliance with the international standards of human rights.

In March 2023, Bahrain hosted a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. However, on 8 March 2023, officials cancelled the entry visas issued to the HRW officials on 30 January 2023 to attend the 146th Congress of the IPU. Bahraini authorities have imposed restrictions on expression, association and assembly in violation of the country&#x27;s international human rights obligations.

On 31 March 2023, three men, Jalal Al-Kassab, Redha Rajab and Mohammed Rajab, were sentenced to prison for a year and faced a fine in Bahrain. They were prosecuted under a law criminalizing the &quot;ridicule&quot; of all books recognized as religious in Bahrain, including the Quran and the Bible. The men were members of a Bahraini religious and cultural society that promotes open discussion of Islamic issues. Human rights groups claimed that they were indicted for exercising his freedom of expression.

===Iran===
Iranian dissidents are composed of scattered groups that reject the current government and by extension the previous regime, instead seeking the establishment of democratic institutions. A partnership council called Mahsa had formed between Reza Pahlavi and other opposition groups in support of the in 2022. The government in 2023 charged 107 exiled Mujahideen with treason. Dissidents have formed Iran Human Rights. Despite the Mykonos restaurant assassinations, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany actively silences exiled Iranian dissidents. Even so, in 2023, the Woman Life Freedom Movement won the Sakharov Prize and imprisoned anti-regime journalist Narges Mohammadi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iran condemned the decision.

===UAE===
The UAE has been accused of imprisoning critics. Like many other Middle Eastern countries, it does not allow criticism of the government. Many Emirati dissidents have been languishing in jail, some of them for a decade.

===Egypt===
A March 2023 report by HRW stated that Egyptian authorities systematically refused to issue or renew ID cards for dozens of foreign dissidents, journalists and human rights activists over the past few years. The denial was possibly intended to pressure them to return to near-certain persecution in Egypt. By arbitrarily denying citizens valid passports and other overseas identification documents, Egyptian authorities violated both the constitution and international human rights law.

<text>Separatism is the advocacy of cultural, ethnic, tribal, religious, racial, regional, governmental, or gender separation from the larger group. As with secession, separatism conventionally refers to full political separation. Groups simply seeking greater autonomy are usually not considered separatists. Some discourse settings equate separatism with religious segregation, racial segregation, or sex segregation, while other discourse settings take the broader view that separation by choice may serve useful purposes and is not the same as government-enforced segregation. There is some academic debate about this definition, and in particular how it relates to secessionism, as has been discussed online.

Separatist groups practice a form of identity politics, or political activity and theorizing founded in the shared experiences of the group&#x27;s members. Such groups believe attempts at integration with dominant groups compromise their identity and ability to pursue greater self-determination. However, economic and political factors usually are critical in creating strong separatist movements as opposed to less ambitious identity movements.

==Motivations==
Groups may have one or more motivations for separation, including:
* Emotional resentment and hatred of rival communities.
* Protection from genocide and ethnic cleansing.
* Resistance by victims of oppression, including denigration of their language, culture or religion.
* Influence and propaganda by those inside and outside the region who hope to gain politically from intergroup conflict and hatred.
* Economic and political dominance of one group that does not share power and privilege in an egalitarian fashion.
* Economic motivations: seeking to end economic exploitation by more powerful group or, conversely, to escape economic redistribution from a richer to a poorer group.
* Preservation of threatened religious, language or other cultural tradition.
* Destabilization from one separatist movement giving rise to others.
* Geopolitical power vacuum from breakup of larger states or empires.
* Continuing fragmentation as more and more states break up.
* Feeling that the perceived nation was added to the larger state by illegitimate means.
* The perception that the state can no longer support one&#x27;s own group or has betrayed their interests.
* Opposition to political decisions.

==Types==
Ethnic separatism can be based on cultural, linguistic as well as religious or racial differences. Ethnic separatist movements were relevant since they represented historical delineations between states, or in recent times, were the cause of conflicts between peoples in Europe, Africa and Asia with different ethnic/linguistic origins.

* List of active separatist movements in Asia
* List of active separatist movements in Europe
* List of active separatist movements in North America
* List of active separatist movements in Oceania
* List of active separatist movements in South America

=== Gender separatism===
The relationship between gender and separatism is complex. Feminist separatism is women&#x27;s choosing to separate from ostensibly male-defined, male-dominated institutions, relationships, roles and activities. Lesbian separatism advocates lesbianism as the logical result of feminism. Some separatist feminists and lesbian separatists have chosen to live apart in intentional community, cooperatives, and on land trusts. Queer nationalism (or &quot;Gay separatism&quot;) seeks a community distinct and separate from other social groups. On the other hand, the MGTOW movement is sometimes considered a male-gender separatism, as at the center of this ideology is the notion of male separatism where men should not be a part of a feminist-biased society. Some fringe elements even propose a utopical no-women state.

=== Geographical and socioeconomic separatism ===

Some examples include:
*Alberta separatism
*Berber separatism in North Africa
*Bougainville independence movement
*Cape Independence
*Casamance independence movement
*Cascadian separatists
*Catalan independence movement
*Provisional Revolutionary Government of Cibao
*Euskadi (Basque Country) independence movement
*Hong Kong independence movement
*New England New State Movement
*Malaysian Sabah and Sarawak separatists
*West Papuan independence
*Free South movement
*Quebec sovereignty movement
*Scottish independence movement
*Taiwanese independence movement

=== Racial separatism===
Some separatist groups seek to separate from others along racial lines. They oppose interracial marriage and integration with other races and seek separate schools, businesses, churches and other institutions, and often separate societies, territories, countries, and governments:

* Black separatism (also known as black nationalism) is the most prominent wave advancing the concepts of &quot;Black racial identity&quot; in the United States and has been advanced by black leaders like Marcus Garvey and organizations such as the Nation of Islam. Critical race theorists like New York University&#x27;s Derrick Bell and University of Colorado&#x27;s Richard Delgado argue that US legal, education and political systems are rife with blatant racism. They support efforts like &quot;all-black&quot; schools and dorms and question the and merit of government-enforced integration. In 2008 statements by Barack Obama&#x27;s former pastor Jeremiah Wright, Jr., revived the issue of the current relevance of black separatism.
* Latin American concepts of racial identity such as the bronze race and La Raza Cósmica are found in the small separatist Raza Unida Party. The Chicano Movement (or Chicano nation) in the United States sought to recreate Aztlán, the mythical homeland of the Aztecs comprising the Southwestern United States.
* White separatism in the United States and Western Europe seeks separation of the white race and limits to nonwhite immigration under the argument that these policies are necessary for the white race&#x27;s survival.

=== Religious separatism===


Religious separatist groups and sects want to withdraw from some larger religious groups and/or believe they should interact primarily with coreligionists:
* English Christians in the 16th and 17th centuries who wished to separate from the Church of England and form independent local churches were influential politically under Oliver Cromwell, who was himself a separatist. They were eventually called Congregationalists. The Pilgrims who established the first successful colony in New England were separatists.
* Christian separatist groups in Indonesia, India and South Carolina (United States) 
* Zionism sought the creation of the State of Israel as a Jewish homeland, with separation from gentile Palestinians. Simon Dubnow, who had mixed feelings toward Zionism, formulated Jewish Autonomism, which was adopted in eastern Europe by Jewish political parties such as the Bund and his own Folkspartei before World War II. Zionism can also be seen as somewhat ethnic too, however, as its definition of who is Jewish has often included people of Jewish background who do not practice the Jewish religion. It is further complicated as some who had ancestors who converted to Judaism, such as some Ethiopian Jews, may not share ethnic history with the Jews, however, are considered to be so but not without debate.

* The Partition of India and (later Pakistan and Bangladesh) arose as a result of separatism on the part of Muslims.
* Sikhs in India sought an independent nation of Khalistan after an agitation in the 1970s and 1980s for implementation of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution (demanding things such as a greater share of river water and autonomy for Punjab) resulted in the storming of the Harimandir Sahib (Golden Temple) by the Government of India troops in 1984. The storming of the temple to flush out Sikh Militants who were gaining momentum in their agitation for greater autonomy for Punjab resulted in Sikhs demanding an independent state for the Sikhs situated in Punjab known as Khalistan. The conflict escalated and led to an assassination of the Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi as a retaliation of an Indian military operation called &#x27;Operation Blue Star&#x27; directed against the Sikhs&#x27; holiest shrine, the Golden Temple, in which many innocent Sikh civilians too died. The revenge murder of Gandhi evoked a Congress Party led backlash in the form of the Sikh genocide, which started in New Delhi and swept India in November 1984. That only further strengthened the Khalistan Movement, but it was largely subdued owing to the efforts of the police in Punjab. The controversial response by the Punjab State reportedly involved the use of human rights violations in the form of unexplained disappearances, faked encounters killings, rape and torture. However, many in the Sikh diaspora in the West and even Sikhs in India, still support the idea of Khalistan, but support has been dying since the 90&#x27;s due to heavy Anti-Khalistan propaganda pushed by the Indian government, and fear of being targeted or killed for supporting Khalistan.
*Muslim separatist groups in the Philippines (Mindanao and other regions: Moro Islamic Liberation Front, Abu Sayyaf), in Thailand (see also South Thailand insurgency), in India (see also Insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir), in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (Xinjiang: East Turkestan Islamic Movement), Tanzania (Zanzibarian separatist movements), in the Central African Republic (Regions that are inhabited by Muslims: Séléka), in Russia (in the Northern Caucasus, especially in Chechnya: Caucasus Emirate), in Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina: Alija Izetbegovic espoused an Islamic inspired separatism)

==Governmental responses==
How far separatist demands will go toward full independence, and whether groups pursue constitutional and nonviolent action or armed violence, depend on a variety of economic, political, social and cultural factors, including movement leadership and the government&#x27;s response. Governments may respond in a number of ways, some of which are mutually exclusive. Some include:

* accede to separatist demands
* improve the circumstances of disadvantaged minorities, be they religious, linguistic, territorial, economic or political
* adopt &quot;asymmetric federalism&quot; where different states have different relations to the central government depending on separatist demands or considerations
* allow minorities to win in political disputes about which they feel strongly, through parliamentary voting, referendum, etc.
* settle for a confederation or a commonwealth relationship where there are only limited ties among states.

<text>Arne Carl-August Beurling (3 February 1905 – 20 November 1986) was a Swedish mathematician and professor of mathematics at Uppsala University (1937–1954) and later at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Beurling worked extensively in harmonic analysis, complex analysis and potential theory. The &quot;Beurling factorization&quot; helped mathematical scientists to understand the Wold decomposition, and inspired further work on the invariant subspaces of linear operators and operator algebras, e.g. Håkan Hedenmalm&#x27;s factorization theorem for Bergman spaces.

He is perhaps most famous for single-handedly decrypting an early version of the German cipher machine Siemens and Halske T52 in a matter of two weeks during 1940, using only pen and paper. This machine&#x27;s cipher is generally considered to be more complicated than that of the more famous Enigma machine. Beurling&#x27;s method of decrypting military telegrams between Norway and Germany worked from June 1940 right up until 1943 when the Germans changed equipment. 

==Early life==
Beurling was born on 3 February 1905 in Gothenburg, Sweden and was the son of the landowner Konrad Beurling and baroness Elsa Raab. After graduating in 1924, he was enrolled at the Uppsala University where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1926 and two years later a Licentiate of Philosophy degree.

==Career==

===Early career===
Beurling was assistant teacher at Uppsala University from 1931 to 1933. He received his doctorate in mathematics in 1933 for his dissertation &quot;Études sur un problème de majoration&quot;. Beurling was a docent of mathematics at Uppsala University from 1933 and then professor of mathematics from 1937 to 1954.

===World War II===
In the summer of 1940 he single-handedly deciphered and reverse-engineered an early version of the Siemens and Halske T52 also known as the &quot;Geheimfernschreiber&quot; (&quot;secret teletypewriter&quot;) used by Nazi Germany in World War II for sending ciphered messages. The T52 was one of the so-called &quot;Fish cyphers&quot;, that, using transposition, created nearly one quintillion (893,622,318,929,520,960) different variations. It took Beurling two weeks to solve the problem using pen and paper. Using Beurling&#x27;s work, a device was created that enabled Sweden to decipher German teleprinter traffic passing through Sweden from Norway on a cable. In this way, Swedish authorities knew about Operation Barbarossa before it occurred. Since the Swedes would not reveal how this knowledge was attained, the Swedish warning was not treated as credible by Soviets.

This became the foundation for the Swedish National Defence Radio Establishment (&quot;FRA&quot;). The cypher in the &quot;Geheimfernschreiber&quot; is generally considered to be more complex than the cypher used in the Enigma machines.

===Later life===
He was visiting professor at Harvard University from 1948 to 1949. From 1954 he was professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, United States, where he took over Albert Einstein&#x27;s office.

He was the doctoral advisor of Lennart Carleson and Carl-Gustav Esseen.

==Personal life==

Arne Beurling was first married (1936–40) to Britta Östberg (born 1907), daughter of Henrik Östberg and Gerda Nilsson. In 1950 he married Karin Lindblad (1920–2006), daughter of ironmonger Henric Lindblad and Wanja Bengtsson. Karin was a distinguished Ph.D student from Uppsala University. When they lived in Princeton, she worked in a biochemistry lab at Princeton University. He had two children from his first marriage — Pehr-Henrik (1936–1962) and Jane (1938–1992).

Beurling&#x27;s great-grandfather was Pehr Henrik Beurling (1758 or 1763–1806), who founded a high quality clock factory in Stockholm in 1783.

==Death==
Arne Beurling died in 1986 and was buried at Norra begravningsplatsen in Solna.

==In popular culture==
Beurling&#x27;s prowess as a cryptanalysist is the subject of the 2005 short opera &quot;Krypto CEG&quot; by Jonas Sjöstrand and Kimmo Eriksson.

==Awards and decorations==

*Knight of the Order of Vasa

==Honours==

<doc id="286534" wikidata="Q592806" url="?curid=286534" title="Truncated icosidodecahedron">
<text>In geometry, a truncated icosidodecahedron, rhombitruncated icosidodecahedron, great rhombicosidodecahedron, omnitruncated dodecahedron or omnitruncated icosahedron is an Archimedean solid, one of thirteen convex, isogonal, non-prismatic solids constructed by two or more types of regular polygon faces.

It has 62 faces: 30 squares, 20 regular hexagons, and 12 regular decagons. It has the most edges and vertices of all Platonic and Archimedean solids, though the snub dodecahedron has more faces. Of all vertex-transitive polyhedra, it occupies the largest percentage (89.80%) of the volume of a sphere in which it is inscribed, very narrowly beating the snub dodecahedron (89.63%) and small rhombicosidodecahedron (89.23%), and less narrowly beating the truncated icosahedron (86.74%); it also has by far the greatest volume (206.8 cubic units) when its edge length equals 1. Of all vertex-transitive polyhedra that are not prisms or antiprisms, it has the largest sum of angles (90 + 120 + 144 = 354 degrees) at each vertex; only a prism or antiprism with more than 60 sides would have a larger sum. Since each of its faces has point symmetry (equivalently, 180° rotational symmetry), the truncated icosidodecahedron is a 15-zonohedron.

==Names==
The name &quot;great rhombicosidodecahedron&quot; refers to the relationship with the (small) rhombicosidodecahedron (compare section Dissection).&lt;br&gt;
There is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron with a similar name, the nonconvex great rhombicosidodecahedron.

==Area and volume==
The surface area &quot;A&quot; and the volume &quot;V&quot; of the truncated icosidodecahedron of edge length &quot;a&quot; are:

: formula_1

If a set of all 13 Archimedean solids were constructed with all edge lengths equal, the truncated icosidodecahedron would be the largest.

==Cartesian coordinates==
Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a truncated icosidodecahedron with edge length 2&quot;φ&quot; − 2, centered at the origin, are all the even permutations of:
:(±, ±, ±(3 + &quot;φ&quot;)),
:(±, ±&quot;φ&quot;, ±(1 + 2&quot;φ&quot;)),
:(±, ±&quot;φ&quot;2, ±(−1 + 3&quot;φ&quot;)),
:(±(2&quot;φ&quot; − 1), ±2, ±(2 + &quot;φ&quot;)) and
:(±&quot;φ&quot;, ±3, ±2&quot;φ&quot;),
where &quot;φ&quot; =  is the golden ratio.

== Dissection ==

The truncated icosidodecahedron is the convex hull of a rhombicosidodecahedron with cuboids above its 30 squares, whose height to base ratio is . The rest of its space can be dissected into nonuniform cupolas, namely 12 between inner pentagons and outer decagons and 20 between inner triangles and outer hexagons.

An alternative dissection also has a rhombicosidodecahedral core. It has 12 pentagonal rotundae between inner pentagons and outer decagons. The remaining part is a toroidal polyhedron.

==Orthogonal projections==
The truncated icosidodecahedron has seven special orthogonal projections, centered on a vertex, on three types of edges, and three types of faces: square, hexagonal and decagonal. The last two correspond to the A2 and H2 Coxeter planes.
==Spherical tilings and Schlegel diagrams ==
The truncated icosidodecahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.

Schlegel diagrams are similar, with a perspective projection and straight edges.
== Geometric variations ==
Within Icosahedral symmetry there are unlimited geometric variations of the &quot;truncated icosidodecahedron&quot; with isogonal faces. The truncated dodecahedron, rhombicosidodecahedron, and truncated icosahedron as degenerate limiting cases.
== Truncated icosidodecahedral graph ==

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a truncated icosidodecahedral graph (or great rhombicosidodecahedral graph) is the graph of vertices and edges of the truncated icosidodecahedron, one of the Archimedean solids. It has 120 vertices and 180 edges, and is a zero-symmetric and cubic Archimedean graph.


== Related polyhedra and tilings==

This polyhedron can be considered a member of a sequence of uniform patterns with vertex figure (4.6.2&quot;p&quot;) and Coxeter-Dynkin diagram . For &quot;p&quot; &lt; 6, the members of the sequence are omnitruncated polyhedra (zonohedrons), shown below as spherical tilings. For &quot;p&quot; &gt; 6, they are tilings of the hyperbolic plane, starting with the truncated triheptagonal tiling.

<text>A consortium () is an association of two or more individuals, companies, organizations, or governments (or any combination of these entities) with the objective of participating in a common activity or pooling their resources for achieving a common goal. Consortia are generally nonprofit with a goal to help its members improve their competitiveness in the specific field.

 is a Latin word meaning &quot;partnership&quot;, &quot;association&quot;, or &quot;society&quot;, and derives from (&quot;shared in property&quot;), itself from (&quot;together&quot;) and (&quot;fate&quot;).

==Examples==
===Educational===
The Universities&#x27; consortium is established to share research laboratories and equipment facilities, exchange faculty and students, provide programs abroad, and form specialized research centers and admissions offices. Generally, it includes a corporate identity, voluntary membership of institutions, its own staff and budgetary autonomy. The Universities&#x27; consortium aims to facilitate the educational process and research by more effectively allocating and conserving limited resources of money, staff, and facilities, identifying specialized areas of teaching and research in which cooperative deals would be alluring. 

Two types of high education consortia are generally realized, the &quot;association&quot; and the &quot;center.&quot; The &quot;association&quot; refers to colleges and universities of similar nature and purpose; the &quot;center&quot; type brings together dissimilar institutions: smaller colleges around a large university.

The Big Ten Academic Alliance in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic U.S., Claremont Colleges consortium in Southern California, Five College Consortium in Massachusetts, and Consórcio Nacional Honda are among the oldest and most successful higher education consortia in the world. The Big Ten Academic Alliance, formerly known as the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, includes the members of the Big Ten athletic conference. The participants in Five Colleges, Inc. are: Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Another example of a successful consortium is the Five Colleges of Ohio of Ohio: Oberlin College, Ohio Wesleyan University, Kenyon College, College of Wooster and Denison University. The aforementioned Claremont Consortium (known as the Claremont Colleges) consists of Pomona College, Claremont Graduate University, Scripps College, Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Pitzer College, and Keck Graduate Institute. These consortia have pooled the resources of their member colleges and the universities to share human and material assets as well as to link academic and administrative resources.

An example of a non-profit consortium is the Appalachian College Association (ACA) located in Richmond, Kentucky. The association consists of 35 private liberal arts colleges and universities spread across the central Appalachian mountains in Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. Collectively these higher education institutions serve approximately 42,500 students. Six research universities in the region (University of Kentucky, University of North Carolina, University of Tennessee, West Virginia University, University of Virginia, and Virginia Tech) are affiliated with the ACA. These institutions assist the ACA in reviewing grant and fellowship applications, conducting workshops, and providing technical assistance. The ACA works to serve higher education in the rural regions of these five states.

===Commercial===
An example of a for-profit consortium is a group of banks that collaborate to make a loan—also known as a syndicate. This type of loan is more commonly known as a syndicated loan. In England it is common for a consortium to buy out financially struggling football clubs in order to keep them out of liquidation.

Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the company that built the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in the 1970s, initially was a consortium of BP, ARCO, ConocoPhillips, Exxon, Mobil, Unocal, and Koch Alaska Pipeline Company.

===Aerospace===
====Airbus example====

Airbus Industries was formed in 1970 as a consortium of aerospace manufacturers. The retention of production and engineering assets by the partner companies in effect made Airbus Industries a sales and marketing company. This arrangement led to inefficiencies due to the inherent conflicts of interest that the four partner companies faced; they were both shareholders of, and subcontractors to, the consortium. The companies collaborated on development of the Airbus range, but guarded the financial details of their own production activities and sought to maximize the transfer prices of their sub-assemblies.

In 2001, EADS (created by the merger of French, German and Spanish Airbus partner companies) and BAE Systems (the British partner company) transferred their Airbus production assets to a new company, Airbus SAS. In return, they got 80% and 20% shares respectively. BAE would later sell its share to EADS.

====Panavia Tornado====
The Tornado was developed and built by Panavia Aircraft GmbH, a tri-national consortium consisting of British Aerospace (previously British Aircraft Corporation), MBB of West Germany, and Aeritalia of Italy.

The aircraft first flew on 14 August 1974 and was introduced into service in 1979–1980. Due to its multi-role design, it was able to replace several different fleets of aircraft in the adopting air forces. The Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) became the only export operator of the Tornado in addition to the three original partner nations. Including all variants, 992 aircraft were built.

===Coopetition===
&quot;Coopetition&quot;, deriving from a portmanteau of cooperation and competition, is the word used when companies otherwise competitors collaborate in a consortium to cooperate on areas non-strategic for their core businesses. They prefer to reduce their costs on these non-strategic areas and compete on other areas where they can differentiate better.

For example, the GENIVI Alliance, now called COVESA, is a not-for-profit consortium between different car makers in order to ease building an In-Vehicle Infotainment system.

Another example is the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is a consortium that standardizes web technologies like HTML, XML and CSS.

===Government, academia and industry===
The Institute for Food Safety and Health is a consortium consisting of the Illinois Institute of Technology, the Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, and members of the food industry. Some of the work done at the institute includes, &quot;assessment and validation of new and novel food safety and preservation technologies, processing and packaging systems, microbiological and chemical methods, health promoting food components, and risk management strategies.&quot;

===Consortium for installment-based purchases===
Commonly known in the United States as a rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA) and also called Savings Clubs, Christmas clubs, &quot;sousou&quot; or even money circles, they are typically informal associations of people saving money together with a commonly shared goal: buying something with the same value. In this association its members contribute by paying equal amount installments (usually monthly or weekly) towards a common fund. On every installment the common fund reaches the goal value and someone is awarded this sum and from this point forward this person own the association the remaining amount, just as in a loan. This process repeats until every member is awarded the entire sum.

These informal associations are specially popular among immigrants since they are a cheaper alternative to traditional financing and usually require no formal papers, credit history or even a bank account.

Outside the United States, these savings clubs can be formal and have proper legislation. In some countries, like Brazil, &quot;consórcios&quot; are an integral part of the traditional banking system, where there are clubs for purchasing real estate and cars, and even for plastic surgery costs. Over seven million people have engaged in these formal savings associations over the past years, adding to over U$10 billion in credit. Since these clubs have up to thousands of members, products purchased are awarded through lottery and bidding processes and the common fund administrators charge a fixed fee in order to take responsibility and guarantee the integrity of the process.

==Legal nature of the consortium agreement in selected countries==
===France===
In France, the consortium, considered a sub-type of joint venture, has important theoretical and practical significance. The French legal system does not provide a definition and does not explicitly use the concept of a joint venture or consortium (&quot;groupements momentanés d’entreprises&quot;). The consortium agreement in France is a purely contractual cooperative contract that does not entail the creation of a third party. The consortium has no legal personality or legal capacity. The contract is concluded between two or more natural or legal persons who undertake to carry out certain works in order to implement a joint project which consortium members would not be able to carry out themselves. The consortium agreement is not explicitly regulated by the French legislator, but it is admissible in the light of the principle of freedom of contract interpreted from articles 6 and 1134 of the French Civil Code.

===United Kingdom===
Neither consortium nor joint venture have a legal definition in U.K. law. The second term is usually used to describe various types of agreements where two or more parties cooperate in conducting business activities. This manifests e.g. in the joint distribution of profit, sharing cash, assets, knowledge or abilities. As there are no legal provisions regulating in detail the consortium or joint venture, the relations between the parties participating in this type of agreement—when choosing a joint venture as a collaboration agreement or a special partnership—are subject to common law or the provisions of the partnership law. A consortium agreement governed by the general law of contract, similar to an ordinary partnership agreement, does not create a separate entity.

===Germany===
In Germany the view prevails that the consortium is a type of internal civil law partnership (§ 705–740 of the BGB). In external relations, consortium members may decide on joint and several liability regulated by § 421 BGB, while internally there is sometimes a release from this liability. Joint ventures often include credit syndicates (Kreditkonsortien), securities issuing consortia, including mainly shares (&quot;Emissionskonsortien&quot;), construction consortia (&quot;Baukonsortien&quot;) also referred to as investment (&quot;Investitionskonsortien&quot;) and profit pools (&quot;Ergebnispools&quot;). Sometimes, special purpose partnerships established to jointly use construction facilities (&quot;Planungsgesellschaften&quot;) are listed in one category with the consortium and the pool. Cooperation agreements concluded under German law are not of a uniform legal nature. There is a great wealth of legal forms of cooperation that could be cautiously qualified as consortium agreements. This is in particular a civil law partnership in its internal and occasional variants (&quot;Gelegenheitsgesellschaft&quot;), as well as a partnership of building contractors (&quot;ARGE&quot;) and a structure simply referred to as the &quot;consortium.&quot;

===Italy===
In Italy, a consortium is governed by the Italian Civil Code. The Civil Code (also known as the “Civil Code of 1942”) in Italy is a body of civil law provisions and general procedural law rules and criminal rules. The code currently in force was issued with the Royal Decree of 16 March 1942, no. 262.

In particular:
* art 862: Land reclamation consortia
* art 863: Land improvement consortia
* art 2602: Consortia for the coordination of production and trade
* art 2612: Consortia with external activity
* art 2616: Mandatory consortia, including those for the storage of agricultural products

===Poland===
In the Polish legal system, the legal nature of the consortium agreement is disputed. According to the prevailing approach, a consortium is a form of cooperation, different from a civil law partnership, undertaken between economically independent entities already operating on the market in order to implement a specific undertaking that is a segment of the regular activities of these entities, based on an unnamed contract and characterized by a temporary nature, minimization of institutionalization, and lack of separate property, the need to specify how the parties participate in the joint venture and the intention not to establish a &quot;community&quot; with partly own interests (the partnership as such). According to this concept, despite the very broad formula of a civil partnership provided for entities that undertake to cooperate in a designated way to achieve a common economic goal (which is a common element for both types of contracts), the partnership contract do not exhaust all forms of cooperation and automatic qualification of consortium contracts as partnerships is not allowed.

<text>An institute is an organizational body created for a certain purpose. They are often research organisations (research institutes) created to do research on specific topics, or can also be a professional body. 

In some countries, institutes can be part of a university or other institutions of higher education, either as a group of departments or an autonomous educational institution without a traditional university status such as a &quot;university institute&quot;, or institute of technology. In some countries, such as South Korea and India, private schools are sometimes referred to as institutes; also, in Spain, secondary schools are referred to as institutes.

Historically, in some countries, institutes were educational units imparting vocational training and often incorporating libraries, also known as mechanics&#x27; institutes. 

The word &quot;institute&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;institutum&quot; (&quot;facility&quot; or &quot;habit&quot;), in turn derived from &quot;instituere&quot; (&quot;build&quot;, &quot;create&quot;, &quot;raise&quot; or &quot;educate&quot;).

In the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man, the term &quot;institute&quot; is a protected word, and companies or other organizations may only use the word if they are &quot;organisations which are carrying out research at the highest level or to professional bodies of the highest standing&quot;. If a company is carrying on a business under a different name to the company name, that business name must comply with the Business Names Act. Use of the title &quot;institute&quot; requires approval from the Secretary of State. Failure to seek approval is a criminal offence.

<text>American Juniors is an American reality television singing competition series that was broadcast for one season from June 3 to August 19, 2003, on Fox. The series was a spin-off of &quot;American Idol&quot;, but with younger contestants. The show had the same production team as &quot;American Idol&quot;: it was created by Simon Fuller and 19 Entertainment along with FremantleMedia, directed by Bruce Gowers, and produced by Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick.

Unlike &quot;American Idol&quot;, the goal of the competition was not to find a single winner, but rather to create a singing group of five of the contestants. In this way, &quot;American Juniors&quot; more closely resembled the British series &quot;S Club Search&quot;, which had produced the group &quot;S Club Juniors&quot;.

The show spawned the singing group American Juniors, consisting of Taylor Thompson, Tori Thompson, Chauncey Matthews, Lucy Hale, and Danielle White. The group disbanded in 2005, after their self-titled studio album generated lackluster sales.

The show was filmed in Los Angeles.

==Ratings and aborted second season==
&quot;American Juniors&quot; became one of the highest-rated television shows of the summer season, with approximately 11.9 million viewers on June 3, though the numbers dropped 40% toward the end of July. Nonetheless, the producers were satisfied of the strong teen demographic. A second season was planned for fall 2003, later postponed to the summer after the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, then called off.

==Following the show==
Upon completion of the competition, the American Juniors group consisted of Taylor and Tori Thompson, Chauncey Matthews, Lucy Hale and Danielle White. The group made a brief appearance on the December 2003 TV special &quot;An American Idol Christmas&quot;. Their debut album &quot;American Juniors&quot; was released on October 6, 2004. The group disbanded in 2005, after having received relatively little publicity.

Almost 20 years after the TV series, Lucy Hale is now the most widely known contestant from &quot;American Juniors&quot;, having acted in a number of films and television shows, most notably the series &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; from 2010 to 2017. She returned to her musical roots in 2014, with the release of the country album &quot;Road Between&quot; on Disney Music Group&#x27;s &quot;Nashville&quot; label.

Katelyn Tarver released her debut solo album, &quot;Wonderful Crazy&quot;, in 2005. From 2010 to 2013, she played Jo Taylor in the Nickelodeon TV series &quot;Big Time Rush&quot;. She has continued to act and release music. In 2019, she appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Songland&quot;.

Jordan McCoy was signed to Diddy&#x27;s label, Bad Boy Records, having only released demos. She was part of the late-2000s revival of the defunct girl group, Dream (also formed by Diddy).

In 2011, Tori and Taylor Thompson resurfaced on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Voice&quot; as a singing duo. They were selected and coached by Cee Lo Green but were voted off in the first live show.

In 2020, &quot;American Juniors&quot; semifinalist Grace Leer auditioned for season 18 of &quot;American Idol&quot;. She made it to Hollywood after singing &quot;Crowded Table&quot; by The Highwomen. She eventually was eliminated at the Top 11.

<text>Vanity Fair is an American monthly magazine of popular culture, fashion, and current affairs published by Condé Nast in the United States.

The first version of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; was published from 1913 to 1936. The imprint was revived in 1983 after Conde Nast took over the magazine company. Vanity Fair currently includes five international editions of the magazine. The five international editions of the magazine are the United Kingdom (since 1991), Italy (since 2003), Spain (since 2008), France (since 2013), and Mexico (since 2015). As of 2018, the editor-in-chief is Radhika Jones.

==History==
===&quot;Dress and Vanity Fair&quot;===

Condé Montrose Nast began his empire by purchasing the men&#x27;s fashion magazine &quot;Dress&quot; in 1913. He renamed the magazine &quot;Dress and Vanity Fair&quot; and published four issues in 1913. It continued to thrive into the 1920s. However, it became a casualty of the Great Depression and declining advertising revenues. Nonetheless, its circulation at 90,000 copies was at its peak. Condé Nast announced in December 1935 that &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; would be folded into &quot;Vogue&quot; (circulation 156,000) as of the March 1936 issue. Vanity Fair celebrates its 95th anniversary in 2008, as well as its 25th anniversary as a relaunched publication. The National Portrait Gallery in London has mounted an exhibition called &quot;Vanity Fair Portraits, 1913–2008&quot;, which traveled to the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra, Australia, to celebrate the magazine&#x27;s photographic heritage. Vanity Fair: The Portraits, a special jubilee issue and hardback book, was published in the fall of 2008.

Vanity Fair is a fictitious place ruled by Beelzebub in the book &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. Later use of the name was influenced by the well-known 1847–48 novel of the same name by William Makepeace Thackeray.

===Modern revival===
Condé Nast Publications, under the ownership of S.I. Newhouse, announced in June 1981 that it was reviving the magazine. The first issue was released in February 1983 (cover date March), edited by Richard Locke, formerly of &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. After three issues, Locke was replaced by Leo Lerman, veteran features editor of &quot;Vogue&quot;. He was followed by editors Tina Brown (1984–1992), Graydon Carter (1992–2017) and Radhika Jones (2017 to present). Regular writers and columnists have included Dominick Dunne, Sebastian Junger, Michael Wolff, Maureen Orth and Christopher Hitchens. Famous contributing photographers for the magazine include Bruce Weber, Annie Leibovitz, Mario Testino and Herb Ritts, who have all provided the magazine with a string of lavish covers and full-page portraits of current celebrities. Amongst the most famous of these was the August 1991 Leibovitz cover featuring a naked, pregnant Demi Moore, an image entitled &quot;More Demi Moore&quot; that to this day holds a spot in pop culture.

In addition to its controversial photography, the magazine also prints articles on a variety of topics. In 1996, journalist Marie Brenner wrote an exposé on the tobacco industry titled &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;. The article was later adapted into a movie &quot;The Insider&quot; (1999), which starred Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Most famously, after more than thirty years of mystery, an article in the May 2005 edition revealed the identity of Deep Throat (W. Mark Felt), one of the sources for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; articles on Watergate, which led to the 1974 resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon. The magazine also features candid interviews with celebrities, including a monthly Proust Questionnaire. Other notable interviews have included: Teri Hatcher, who revealed in the magazine that she was sexually abused as a child; Jennifer Aniston&#x27;s first interview after her divorce from Brad Pitt; Anderson Cooper, who talked about his brother&#x27;s death; and Martha Stewart&#x27;s first interview after her release from prison.

Some of the pictorials in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; have attracted criticism. The April 1999 issue featured an image of actor Mike Myers dressed as a Hindu deity for a photo spread by David LaChapelle: after criticism, both the photographer and the magazine apologized.

The magazine was the subject of Toby Young&#x27;s book, &quot;How to Lose Friends and Alienate People&quot;, about his search for success in New York City while working for Graydon Carter&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. The book was made into a movie in 2008, with Jeff Bridges playing Carter.

In 2013, Condé Nast Entertainment struck a deal with Discovery Communications-owned cable channel Investigation Discovery for &quot;Vanity Fair Confidential&quot;, a crime and mystery documentary TV series based on stories from &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine. Condé Nast Entertainment launched a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; YouTube channel in July 2013. In anticipation of its 100th anniversary that year, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; co-produced 10 short films, one to celebrate each decade, from well-known documentary filmmakers like Barbara Kopple and including the film producer Judd Apatow, and actors Don Cheadle and Bryce Dallas Howard.
&quot;Vanity Fair&quot; launched &quot;The Hive&quot; in June 2016, its online business, politics and technology news vertical. In January 2017, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Hive&quot; and Condé Nast Entertainment partnered with Cheddar online TV channel to create a live weekly series called &quot;VF Hive on Cheddar&quot;. Editor Graydon Carter called the series a &quot;representation of how people are consuming more voraciously than ever&quot;.

In 2017 former editor Tina Brown published &quot;The Vanity Fair Diaries&quot;. It was announced in November 2017 that Radhika Jones, editorial director of &quot;The New York Times&quot; books section, would succeed Carter as Editor-in-Chief on December 11, 2017.

In 2018, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; received accolades for removing actor James Franco from a cover shoot following sexual harassment allegations.

In 2020, Dario Calmese became the first Black photographer to shoot the cover of a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; issue; his subject was Viola Davis. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; employees unionized in 2022.

==International editions==
In 1991 Vanity Fair began publishing an international edition. There are currently five international editions of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; being published: namely in the United Kingdom (since 1991), Italy (since 2003, ISSN 1723-6673), Spain (since 2008), France (since 2013), and Mexico (since 2015), with the Italian version published weekly. The Italian &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; was established in October 2003 and celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2013.

&quot;Vanity Fair Germany&quot; launched in February 2007 at a cost of €50 million (euros), then the most expensive new magazine in Germany in years and Condé Nast&#x27;s biggest investment outside the United States. After circulation had plummeted from half a million to less than 200,000 per week, the German edition was shut down in 2009.
==Events==
As a successor to a similar invitation-only event annually held by the late agent Irving Paul Lazar, the first &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; Oscar Party took place in 1994. During its first years, the magazine&#x27;s Oscar party was co-hosted by producer Steve Tisch at Morton&#x27;s in West Hollywood. At first, editor Graydon Carter kept the invitation list small, at around 120 for dinner. In 2008, in sympathy with a Writers Guild of America strike, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; canceled its annual party. Between 2009 and 2013, the party was held at Sunset Tower. The 2014 edition took place in a temporary, 12,000-square-foot glass-walled structure at 8680 Sunset Boulevard. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; makes a limited number of invitations available each year for charity.

In recent years, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and Bloomberg have hosted an after-party at the French ambassador&#x27;s residence in Washington, D.C. following the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association dinner.

==Controversy==
===Roman Polanski lawsuit===
In 2005, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; was found liable in a lawsuit brought in the UK by film director Roman Polanski, who claimed the magazine had libelled him in an article by A. E. Hotchner published in 2002. The article recounted a claim by Lewis H. Lapham, editor of &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, that Polanski had made sexual advances towards a young model as he was traveling to the funeral of his wife, Sharon Tate, in August 1969, claiming that he could make her &quot;the next Sharon Tate&quot;. The court permitted Polanski to testify via a video link, after he expressed fears that he might be extradited were he to enter the United Kingdom.

The trial began on July 18, 2005, and Polanski made English legal history as the first claimant to give evidence by video link. During the trial, which included the testimonies of Mia Farrow and others, it was proved that the alleged scene at the famous New York restaurant Elaine&#x27;s could not possibly have taken place on the date given, because Polanski only dined at this restaurant three weeks later. Also, the Norwegian then-model disputed the accounts that he had claimed to be able to make her &quot;the next Sharon Tate&quot;.

Polanski was awarded damages by the High Court in London. The case was notable because Polanski was living in France as a fugitive from U.S. justice, and never appeared in the London court for fear he would be extradited to the U.S. Graydon Carter, editor of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, responded, &quot;I find it amazing that a man who lives in France can sue a magazine that is published in America in a British courtroom.&quot;

===Miley Cyrus photos===
On April 25, 2008, the televised entertainment program &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; reported that 15-year-old Miley Cyrus had posed topless for a photo shoot with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. The photo, and subsequently released behind-the-scenes photos, show Cyrus without a top, her bare back exposed but her front covered with a bedsheet. The photo shoot was taken by photographer Annie Leibovitz. The full photograph was published with an accompanying story on &quot;The New York Times&quot; website on April 27, 2008. On April 29, 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; clarified that though the pictures left an impression that she was bare-breasted, Cyrus was wrapped in a bedsheet and was actually not topless. Some parents expressed outrage at the nature of the photograph, which a Disney spokesperson described as &quot;a situation [that] was created to deliberately manipulate a 15-year-old to sell magazines&quot;.

In response to the internet circulation of the photo and ensuing media attention, Miley Cyrus released a statement of apology on April 27: &quot;I took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be &#x27;artistic&#x27; and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed. I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about.&quot; Nearly ten years later to the day, Cyrus took back the Disney apology statement in an Instagram story showing a &quot;New York Post&quot; front page regarding the story, simply stating &quot;IM NOT SORRY Fuck YOU #10YearsAgo&quot;.

===Modified photos===
In January 2014, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; was under fire for allegedly altering the appearance of a celebrity featured in its pages for its February issue, Lupita Nyong&#x27;o, an actress known for her role in &quot;12 Years A Slave&quot;. In Nyong&#x27;o&#x27;s case, the magazine tweeted the photo and it began with fans accusing the company of altering her complexion. However, some believe that the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; images are simply a product of bright set lighting, rather than deliberate skin lightening. Nyong&#x27;o was pleased with the work and saw no harm done to herself; she did not hold &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; or the photographer liable.

Shortly before the Nyong&#x27;o case, &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, a partner and buyer of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1936, was accused of altering actress Lena Dunham&#x27;s photos. Dunham considered the modified photos to be offensive.

===Richard Engel story===
In 2015, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; had to update the account it had published by the NBC News correspondent Richard Engel about the disputed circumstances of his 2012 kidnapping in Syria, stating that he had misidentified his captors.

===Jeffrey Epstein story===
In 2019, former contributing editor Vicky Ward said her 2003 profile of Jeffrey Epstein in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; had included on-the-record accounts of Annie and Maria Farmer (who filed the earliest known criminal complaints about Epstein), but that they were later stricken from Ward&#x27;s article after Bill Clinton pressured the magazine&#x27;s editor Graydon Carter.

<text>Deep Impact is a 1998 American science fiction disaster film directed by Mimi Leder, written by Bruce Joel Rubin and Michael Tolkin, and starring Robert Duvall, Téa Leoni, Elijah Wood, Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell, and Morgan Freeman. Steven Spielberg served as an executive producer of this film. It was released by Paramount Pictures in North America and by DreamWorks Pictures internationally on May 8, 1998. The film depicts humanity&#x27;s attempts to prepare for and destroy a wide comet set to collide with Earth and cause a mass extinction.

&quot;Deep Impact&quot; was released in the same summer as the similarly themed &quot;Armageddon&quot;, which fared better at the box office, while astronomers described &quot;Deep Impact&quot; as being more accurate. &quot;Deep Impact&quot; was slightly better received critically than &quot;Armageddon&quot;, although both ultimately received mixed reviews. &quot;Deep Impact&quot; grossed over $349.5 million worldwide on an $80 million production budget, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 1998.

It was the final film by cinematographer Dietrich Lohmann, who died before the film&#x27;s release.

==Plot==

In May 1998, at a star party in Richmond, Virginia, Leo Beiderman observes an unidentified object in the night sky. He sends a picture to astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf, who realizes it is a comet on a collision course with Earth. Wolf dies in a car crash while racing to raise the alarm.

A year later, Jenny Lerner investigates Secretary of the Treasury Alan Rittenhouse over his connection with &quot;Ellie&quot;, whom she assumes to be a mistress; she is confused when she finds him and his daughter Lily loading a boat with large amounts of food and other survival gear. She is apprehended by the FBI and taken to meet President Tom Beck, who persuades her not to share the story in return for a prominent role in the press conference he will arrange. She subsequently discovers that &quot;Ellie&quot; is actually an acronym—E.L.E.—which stands for &quot;extinction-level event&quot;. Two days later, Beck announces that the comet Wolf–Beiderman is on course to impact the Earth in roughly one year and could cause humanity&#x27;s extinction. He reveals that the United States and Russia have been constructing the &quot;Messiah&quot; in orbit, a spacecraft to transport a team to alter the comet&#x27;s path with nuclear bombs.

The &quot;Messiah&quot; launches a short time later with a crew of five American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut led by its captain Spurgeon Tanner. They land on the comet&#x27;s outer-most layer and drill the nuclear bombs deep beneath its surface, but the comet shifts into the sunlight. Consequently, Oren is blinded and an explosive release of gas propels Gus into space. The remaining crew escape the comet and detonate the bombs. However, rather than deflect the comet, the bombs split it in two. Beck announces the mission&#x27;s failure in a television address, and that both pieces—the larger now named Wolf and the smaller named Beiderman—are still headed for Earth. Wolf is on a collision course with western Canada, and its impact is expected to fill the atmosphere with dust, blocking all sunlight for two years and creating an impact winter that will kill all life on the planet&#x27;s surface.

Martial law is imposed and a lottery selects 800,000 Americans to join 200,000 pre-selected individuals in underground shelters in Missouri&#x27;s limestone bluffs. Lerner is pre-selected, as are the Beidermans as gratitude for Leo discovering the comet, though his girlfriend Sarah and her parents are not selected. Lerner&#x27;s mother Robin, upon learning most senior citizens are ineligible for the lottery, commits ritual suicide. Leo marries Sarah in a vain attempt; while this saves her, Vicky and Chuck are still not selected, and she refuses to go without them. A last-ditch effort to deflect the comets with ICBMs fails. Upon arrival at the shelter, Leo eschews his safety and leaves to find Sarah. He reaches her on the freeway and takes her and her newborn brother to higher ground while Vicky and Chuck remain. Lerner gives up her seat on an evacuation helicopter to Beth and her daughter Caitlin, instead traveling to a beach where she reconciles with her estranged father Jason.

The Beiderman fragment hits the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, creating a megatsunami that destroys much of the East Coast of the United States, reaching the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and also hitting Europe and Africa. Millions including Lerner, Jason, Vicky and Chuck are killed, and countless more are left homeless. Leo, Sarah and her brother survive after making it to the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The &quot;Messiah&quot; crew, now dangerously low on both life-support and remaining propellant fuel, decide to sacrifice themselves to destroy the Wolf fragment by flying deep inside it and detonating their remaining nuclear bombs. They say goodbye to their loved ones by video call and execute their plan. Wolf is blown into a million pieces of ice and rock which burn up harmlessly in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and lit up the sky for an hour, averting further catastrophe.

Sometime after the waters receded, Beck addresses a large crowd at an under-construction replacement United States Capitol and announces plans to rebuild what they&#x27;ve been re-given.

==Production==
The origins of &quot;Deep Impact&quot; started in the late 1970s when producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown approached Paramount Pictures proposing a remake of the 1951 film &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot;. Although several screenplay drafts were completed, the producers were not completely happy with any of them and the project remained in &quot;development hell&quot; for many years. In the mid-1990s, they approached director Steven Spielberg, with whom they had made the 1975 blockbuster &quot;Jaws&quot;, to discuss their long-planned project. However, Spielberg had already bought the film rights to the 1993 novel &quot;The Hammer of God&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke, which dealt with a similar theme of an asteroid on a collision course for Earth and humanity&#x27;s attempts to prevent its own extinction. Spielberg planned to produce and direct &quot;The Hammer of God&quot; himself for his then-fledgling DreamWorks studio, but opted to merge the two projects with Zanuck and Brown, and they commissioned a screenplay for what would become &quot;Deep Impact&quot;.

In 1995, the forthcoming film was announced in industry publications as &quot;Screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin, based on the film &quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; and &quot;The Hammer of God&quot; by Arthur C Clarke&quot; though ultimately, following a subsequent redraft by Michael Tolkin, neither source work would be credited in the final film. Spielberg still planned to direct &quot;Deep Impact&quot; himself, but commitments to his 1997 film &quot;Amistad&quot; prevented him from doing so in time, particularly as Touchstone Pictures had just announced their own similarly-themed film &quot;Armageddon&quot;, also to be released in summer 1998. Not wanting to wait, the producers opted to hire Mimi Leder to direct &quot;Deep Impact&quot;, with Spielberg acting as executive producer. Leder was unaware of the other film being made. “I couldn’t believe it. And the press was trying to pit us against each other. That didn’t feel good. Both films have great value and, fortunately, they both succeeded tremendously.&quot; Clarke&#x27;s novel was used as part of the film&#x27;s publicity campaign both before and after the film&#x27;s release and he was disgruntled about not being credited on the film.

Jenny Lerner, the character played by Téa Leoni, was originally intended to work for CNN. CNN rejected this because it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot;. MSNBC agreed to be featured in the movie instead, seeing it as a way to gain exposure for the then newly created network.

Director Mimi Leder later explained that she would have liked to travel to other countries to incorporate additional perspectives, but due to a strict filming schedule and a comparatively low budget, the idea was scratched. Visual effects supervisor Scott Farrar felt that coverage of worldwide events would have distracted and detracted from the main characters&#x27; stories.

A number of scientists worked as science consultants for the film including astronomers Gene Shoemaker, Carolyn Shoemaker, Josh Colwell and Chris Luchini, former astronaut David Walker, and the former director of the NASA&#x27;s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center Gerry Griffin.

==Soundtrack==

The music for the film was composed and conducted by James Horner.

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===
&quot;Deep Impact&quot; was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States and DreamWorks Pictures internationally on May 8, 1998.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Deep Impact&quot; was released on VHS on October 20, 1998, LaserDisc on November 3 and DVD on December 15.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Deep Impact&quot; debuted at the North American box office with $41 million in ticket sales. It managed to cross over &quot;Twister&quot;, scoring the tenth-highest opening weekend of all time. For a decade, the film held the record for having the biggest opening weekend for a female-directed film until it was taken by &quot;Twilight&quot; in 2008. The film grossed $140 million in North America and an additional $209 million worldwide for a total gross of $349 million. Despite competition in the summer of 1998 from the similar &quot;Armageddon&quot;, both films were widely successful, with &quot;Deep Impact&quot; being the higher opener of the two, while &quot;Armageddon&quot; was the most profitable overall.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Deep Impact&quot; had a mixed critical reception. Based on 98 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 45% of critics enjoyed the film, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A tidal wave of melodrama sinks &quot;Deep Impact&quot;″s chance at being the memorable disaster flick it aspires to be.&quot; Metacritic gave a score of 40 out of 100 based on 20 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the film &quot;has a more brooding, thoughtful tone than this genre usually calls for&quot;, while Rita Kempley and Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; criticized what they saw as unemotional performances and a lack of tension.

===Accolades===
At the 1998 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Supporting Actress for Leoni (lost to Lacey Chabert for &quot;Lost in Space&quot;) and Worst Screenplay For A Film Grossing More Than $100 Million (Using Hollywood Math) (lost to &quot;Godzilla&quot;). The film was also nominated for Best Science Fiction Film at the Saturn Awards but lost to both &quot;Dark City&quot; and another asteroid film, &quot;Armageddon&quot;.

<doc id="286546" wikidata="Q82194" url="?curid=286546" title="Flag of Brazil">
<text>The national flag of Brazil is a blue disc depicting a starry sky (which includes the Southern Cross) spanned by a curved band inscribed with the national motto (&#x27;Order and Progress&#x27;), within a yellow rhombus, on a green field. It was officially adopted on 19 November 1889, four days after the Proclamation of the Republic, to replace the flag of the Empire of Brazil. The concept was the work of Raimundo Teixeira Mendes, with the collaboration of , and Décio Villares.

The green field and yellow rhombus from the previous imperial flag were preserved (though slightly modified in hue and shape). In the imperial flag, the green represented the House of Braganza of Pedro I, the first Emperor of Brazil, while the yellow represented the House of Habsburg of his wife, Empress Maria Leopoldina. A blue circle with white five-pointed stars replaced the arms of the Empire of Brazil its position in the flag reflects the sky over the city of Rio de Janeiro on 15 November 1889. The motto is derived from Auguste Comte&#x27;s motto of positivism: &quot;L&#x27;amour pour principe et l&#x27;ordre pour base; le progrès pour but&quot; (&quot;Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal&quot;).

Each star, corresponding to a Brazilian Federal Unit, is sized in proportion relative to its geographic size, and, according to Brazilian Law, the flag must be updated in case of the creation or extinction of a state. At the time the flag was first adopted in 1889, it had 21 stars. It then received one more star in 1960 (representing the state of Guanabara), then another in 1968 (representing Acre), and finally four more stars in 1992 (representing Amapá, Roraima, Rondônia and Tocantins), totaling 27 stars in its current version.

==History==

===Colonial Brazil (1500–1815)===

The Portuguese territories in the Americas, corresponding roughly to what is now Brazil, never had their own official flag, since Portuguese tradition encouraged hoisting the flag of the Kingdom of Portugal in all territories of the Portuguese Crown.

The first Brazilian vexillological symbols were private maritime flags used by Portuguese merchant ships that sailed to Brazil. A flag with green and white stripes was used until 1692. The green and white colors represented the House of Braganza and the national colours of Portugal. In 1692, that flag was no longer used by ships that sailed to Brazil and became the flag of the merchant vessels in coastal Portugal. In 1692, a new flag was introduced for merchant vessels sailing to Brazil. The new flag had a white field with a golden armillary sphere. The armillary sphere had served as the personal emblem of King Manuel I of Portugal (reigned 1494–1521). During his reign Portuguese ships used it widely, and eventually it became a national emblem of Portugal and, more specifically, of the Portuguese empire. A similar flag was introduced for the Portuguese ships that sailed to India, but with a red armillary sphere. Despite representing the entire Portuguese empire, the armillary sphere began to be used more extensively in Brazil – the largest and most developed colony at the time – not only in maritime flags, but also on coins and other media. It eventually became the unofficial ensign of Brazil.

===United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves (1815–1822)===
In 1815, Brazil was elevated to the rank of kingdom, and the kingdoms of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves were united as a single state – the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. The Charter Act of 1816 established the insignia of the new kingdom. It specified that the arms of the Kingdom of Brazil was to be composed of a gold armillary sphere on a blue field. During this time, the flag of Brazil was the flag of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves.

===Empire of Brazil (1822–1889)===
The flag of Brazil was designed by Jean-Baptiste Debret as the Royal Standard of the Prince Royal of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, Pedro I.

After the Brazilian Declaration of Independence, and with the coronation of Pedro I as Emperor of Brazil, the Royal Standard was modified to become the flag of the Empire of Brazil. The new flag featured the imperial coat of arms within a yellow rhombus, on a green field. The green and yellow colors represented the dynastic houses of Pedro I and his consort Maria Leopoldina of Austria.

The imperial flag was slightly modified during the reign of Pedro II, when an extra star was added to the imperial arms to conform to the new territorial organization of the country.

===Republic of Brazil (1889–present)===
Upon the proclamation of the Republic, one of the civilian leaders of the movement, the jurist Ruy Barbosa, proposed a design for the nation&#x27;s new flag strongly inspired by the flag of the United States. It was flown from 15 to 19 November 1889, when marshal Deodoro da Fonseca (acting as provisional president of Brazil) vetoed the design, citing concerns that it looked too similar to the flag of another country.
Fonseca suggested that the flag of the new republic should resemble the old imperial flag. This was intended to underscore continuity of national unity during the transition from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. Raimundo Teixeira Mendes presented a project in which the imperial coat of arms was replaced by a blue celestial globe and the positivist motto. It was presented to Fonseca, who promptly accepted. The flag was designed by a group formed by Raimundo Teixeira Mendes, Miguel Lemos, Manuel Pereira Reis and Décio Villares. It was officially adopted on 19 November 1889.

The flag has been modified on three occasions to add additional stars intended to reflect newly created states: 1960 (22 stars), 1968 (23 stars) and 1992 (27 stars). In contrast to many other national flags with elements representing political subdivisions, modifications to the flag of Brazil were not always made promptly upon political reorganisation, resulting in multi-year periods of history where there was a mismatch between the number of stars and the number of states and federal districts. The most recent modification was made on 11 May 1992, with the addition of four stars to the celestial globe (representing states created between 1982 and 1991), and a slight change in the stars&#x27; positions was made to match the astronomical coordinates correctly.

==Design==
Decree No. 4, issued on 19 November 1889, legally replaced the flag used under the constitutional monarchy with the new national flag. The last change was held on 11 May 1992, Law No. 8.421, altered the celestial globe with the addition of six stars.

===Construction===

The precise positions of the 27 stars on the globe make the Brazilian flag one of the most complicated national flags to construct. The official design is defined by Law No. 5,700, issued on 1 September 1971. The flag&#x27;s length is twenty modules and the width, fourteen, translating into an aspect ratio of 10:7. The distance of the vertices of the yellow rhombus to the outer frame is a module and seven-tenths (1.7 m). The blue circle in the middle of the yellow rhombus has a radius of three and a half modules (3.5 m). The center of the arcs of the white band is two modules (2 m) to the left of the meeting point of the extended vertical diameter of the circle with the base of the outer frame. The radius of the lower arc of the white band is eight modules (8m) and the radius of the upper arc of the white band is eight and a half modules (8.5 m). The width of the white band is a half of a module (0.5 m).

The caption &quot;Ordem e Progresso&quot; is written in green letters. The letter P lies on the vertical diameter of the circle. The letters of the word &quot;Ordem&quot; and the word &quot;Progresso&quot; are a third of a module (0.33 m) tall. The width of these letters is three-tenths of a module (0.30 m). The conjunction E has a height of three-tenths of a module (0.30 m) and a width of a quarter of a module (0.25 m).

The stars are of five different sizes: first, second, third, fourth and fifth magnitudes. They are drawn within circles whose diameters are: three-tenths of a module (0.30 m) for the first magnitude, a quarter of a module (0.25 m) for the second magnitude; a fifth of a module (0.20 m) for the third magnitude, a seventh of a module (0.14 m) for the fourth magnitude, and a tenth of a module (0.10 m) for the fifth magnitude.

====Stars====
Paulo Araújo Duarte of the Federal University of Santa Catarina claims that &quot;the creators of our republican flag intended to represent the stars in the sky at Rio de Janeiro at 8:30 in the morning on 15 November 1889, the moment at which the constellation of the Southern Cross was on the meridian of Rio de Janeiro and the longer arm [of the cross] was vertical&quot;. Another article, citing &quot;O Céu da Bandeira (The Sky of the Flag)&quot;, by J. R. V. Costa, says the exact time was actually 08:37. This last article includes the flag&#x27;s designer&#x27;s explanation of his intentions regarding the stars.
According to Brazil&#x27;s national act number 5,700 of 1 September 1971, the flag portrays the stars as they would be seen by an imaginary observer an infinite distance above Rio de Janeiro standing outside the firmament in which the stars are meant to be placed (i.e. as found on a celestial globe). Thus Beta Crucis appears to the right of the constellation and Delta Crucis to the left, in mirror image of the way they actually appear in the sky (and, coincidentally, the way they appear on the Brazilian coat of arms).

The star Spica is the only one above the white band; it symbolises part of Brazilian territory in the northern hemisphere (and the State of Pará).

The Sigma Octantis (south pole star) is small, but all the other stars turn around it. Its unique position in the sky of the southern hemisphere represents the stability of the Federal District in the Brazilian union.

The shining star in constellation represent the size of territory of the state in the Brazilian region (constellation).

The flag of Brazil contains 27 stars, representing the Brazilian states and the Federal District. The constellation of the Southern Cross is on the meridian (indicated by the number 6 in the diagram). To the south of it is Polaris Australis (Sigma Octantis, numbered 7), representing the Federal District. A single star lies above the band, representing the large northern state of Pará, which straddles the equator.

The band with its motto appears roughly coincident with the ecliptic, as in the armillary symbol of Manuel I of Portugal and colonial Brazil, or otherwise the celestial equator, while none of the stars symbolized lie north of these lines. Some interpretations of the band also identify it with the Amazon River.

The specific shades of colors used in the flag are not specified in any legal document. The values listed below can be found in the files available for download from the Brazilian government website:
=== Proposed design alterations ===

In 2021, the movement &quot;Amor na Bandeira&quot; (in English, &quot;Love in the Flag&quot;) proposed to update the flag&#x27;s motto from &quot;Ordem e Progresso&quot; to &quot;Amor, Ordem e Progresso&quot; (&quot;Love, Order and Progress&quot;), in allusion to the motto of positivism &quot;L&#x27;amour pour principe et l&#x27;ordre pour base; le progrès pour but&quot; (&quot;Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal&quot;), formulated by the French philosopher Augusto Comte, which inspired the original motto in the flag. One of the main proponents of the movement was the politician Eduardo Suplicy, who had previously supported bill PL 2179/2003 by Deputy Chico Alencar, which had the same goal. That 2003 bill also aimed to change the expression on the Brazilian flag to Love, Order and Progress.

==Flag protocol==

Federal Law No. 5,700, issued on 1 September 1971, defines the flag protocol in Brazil. The flag must be permanently hoisted at the Praça dos Três Poderes in Brasília. The flag must be raised and lowered daily at the presidential palaces (Palácio do Planalto and Palácio da Alvorada); ministries; National Congress; Supreme Federal Tribunal; Supreme Court of Justice; seats of the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches; diplomatic missions; Federal, state and local institutions; and merchant navy units. When a flag is no longer fit to use, it must be delivered to a military facility to be burned during a special ceremony on 19 November (&quot;Flag Day&quot;).

The flag must be flown at half-staff when the President decrees official mourning. In addition, state and local governments may decree official mourning with the death of a mayor or governor. When the flag is displayed at half-staff, prior to raising or lowering it, the flag must be raised to the top of the flagpole and then lowered to the halfway mark. When the flag is being carried in procession, a black crape ribbon must be tied to the top of the mast.

A foreign flag may only be flown with a Brazilian Flag along its right side. The only exceptions are when the foreign flag is displayed in an embassy or consulate and in prize-giving ceremonies of sport competitions won by foreign athletes. When multiple flags are raised or lowered simultaneously, the Brazilian Flag must be the first to reach the top of the flagpole and the last to reach the bottom.

===Folding===
===Flag anthem===

The Brazilian Flag Anthem (&quot;Hino à Bandeira Nacional&quot;) is a song dedicated to the country&#x27;s flag. It is performed on 19 November (Flag Day). The Portuguese lyrics were written by poet Olavo Bilac, and the music composed by Francisco Braga.

==Other flags==

===Governmental flags===
The president and vice president are also represented by their own flag. The is a dark green rectangle (ratio 2:3) holding the national coat of arms on its center. It is usually hoisted at the President&#x27;s official residence, the Palácio da Alvorada, and at the President&#x27;s workplace, the Palácio do Planalto. It is also displayed on the presidential car, as small-sized flags. The is a yellow rectangle (ratio 2:3) with twenty-three blue stars disposed in a cross dividing the flag into four equal quadrants, with the coat of arms in the middle of the upper left quadrant.

====Military flags====
Some of the branches of the Brazilian military also have their own flags.
=====Naval jack=====
The Brazilian naval jack (&quot;jaque&quot;) is a rectangular flag (ratio 3:4) bearing 21 white stars on a dark blue field – a horizontal row of 13 and a vertical column of 9, orthogonally displayed.

===Previous flags===
The list below identifies previous flags used in Brazil.

===Rejected flags===
The best-known rejected flags are listed below. Several projects were heavily inspired by the green-yellow Imperial Flag, while a black-white-red pattern was also proposed. Those colours would represent the major groups of Brazilian population, red being the natives, white the European settlers and immigrants and black the Africans.

<text>Thomas Abbt (; 25 November 1738 – 3 November 1766) was a German mathematician and writer.

== Education ==
Born in Ulm as the son of a wig-maker, Abbt visited a secondary school in Ulm, then moved in 1756 to study theology, philosophy and mathematics at the University of Halle, receiving a Magister degree in 1758. Abbt was a student of Georg Friedrich Meier and Johann Andreas Segner. Abbt was taught English by Segner. One year after submitting his doctoral dissertation Abbt received the formal permission to teach.

== Career ==
In 1760 Abbt was appointed as an associate professor of philosophy at the University of Frankfurt (Oder), where he wrote his most well-known work &quot;Vom Tode für&#x27;s Vaterland&quot; (1761).

This highly patriotic tract thematises Frederick II&#x27;s defeat at Kunersdorf. It also drew the attention of the editors of the famous &quot;Literaturbriefe (Literary Letters)&quot;, started by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. He contributed a large number of historical, political, esthetical and philosophical essays. Abbt was a fervent admirer of Lessing and seconded his educational, prosaic style of writing.

In autumn 1761 he was appointed as full professor of mathematics in Rinteln. In 1763, he entered a competition that was sponsored by the Berlin Academy for an essay on the application of mathematical proofs to metaphysics. Among the competitors were Moses Mendelssohn, who won, and Immanuel Kant. While in Rinteln, Abbt wrote his other famous work, &quot;Vom Verdienste&quot; (1765).

He travelled for nine months to France, where he was able to speak with Voltaire in Ferney. He also climbed in the Alps of Savoy. This travel and the disapproval of the life at the university raised his urge to &quot;trade the Theory for the Life&quot;.

While dealing with the idea to become a historian, he was offered in 1765 at the same time a professorship at the University of Marburg and a post as Councillor of the Court at the court of Count Wilhelm von Schaumburg-Lippe. He decided for the latter. The count was highly interested in the plans of Thomas Abbt, which included a history of Maximilian and a translation of Sallust among others.

However, in 1766, the twenty-seven-year-old Abbt suddenly died of an intestinal illness in Bückeburg. Of him Herder wrote that he &quot;died for Germany and for his language too early!&quot;

== Abbt on sabbatical ==
Thomas Abbt wanted to grapple the exigencies of German social and intellectual life in a novel fashion. His work was an early attempt to create a space in which it became possible for individuals to think, talk, and act in reference to a larger socio-political whole. As Abbt finished up his studies, he took his professorship at the University of Frankfurt in 1760, where he began to work on &quot;Dying for the Fatherland&quot; in 1761. In early 1763 Abbt obtained the permission from his employer for a one year sabbatical. On his travels to Switzerland he visited Justus Möser, Johann Wilhelm von Archenholz, Friedrich Karl von Moser, Johann Daniel Schöpflin, and Isaak Iselin. 

A lot of Abbt&#x27;s work was an attempt to get the public life in the German society to act more for the good of the country, where he tries to motivate the people that anyone can be great. Even though he tries to motivate the people of Germany with words, Abbt is convinced that we have no one in Germany who equals his talent or can not even compare someone else to his writing. As he was concerned between the human heart and social utility, Abbt continued his word and his patriotism had a way to a fairly wide range of philosophy. He insisted on grounding moral discussion in the common understanding of the mass of human kind.

Abbt&#x27;s writing is much different from normal writing, everything he writes, he has a goal within it to send a message. He envisions a type of writing that leaves a lasting impression on the reader, as he tries to make the reader go into his or her resolution and action. His writing is clear that he writes with the literature of an awakening, as he tries to motivate his readers to make a lasting and meaningful impact on the world, which is a big part on why he wrote &quot;On Dying for the Fatherland&quot;.

==Abbt&#x27;s beliefs==
In his writings he likes to express that there is an enlightened judgement for moral behavior and discussion. Within moral behavior, comes equality and Abbt emphasizes how the great women of the world are made of the same stuff as the great men. He believes that women should be relevant members of the informal public sphere, as it will bring good-heartedness and good-will. This is where here pushes for equality as he believes all help is needed, no matter what gender. Abbt also emphasizes that true religion is very strong, not a weakness, which will help transition things into a common good. As he believes that greatness is generally &quot;in-born&quot;, it makes him less interested in reducing everyone to the same level, and would rather show how everyone can contribute.

He argued that patriotism in modern monarchies could be grounded in an aesthetic passion of enthusiasm generated through sensuous examples of great virtue. As Abbt believes this, he wants people in Germany to love their country and defend it as he wants everyone to do something good and impactful to benefit their homeland or &quot;fatherland&quot;.

==Understanding Abbt&#x27;s writing==
Abbt was a different type of writer in his time, his primary audience was the middle and higher orders in Germany. After his death in 1770, he was honored for his writing on &quot;Problem of Publikum&quot;, where he described and taught pure virtue along with innocence. This writing of his began to evolve as it was looked at as a vision which seemed to hold unlimited promise. In understanding Abbts writing, it is important to realize that there was a relationship between the German public sphere and the Enlightenment discourse within it. His vision of the informal public sphere existing more or less independently of government based on natural, human impulses, resonates with Shaftesbury in this regard.

In Abbt&#x27;s book &quot;On Dying for the Fatherland&quot;, he attempts to show a sense of public-spiritedness among his fellowship in every order. The love for a Fatherland is a big message that Abbt writes, where he writes for a stronger impetus to sacrifice, then it is a desire for honor, and Abbt tries to show how that is possible. It is hard to pick up certain points in his writing, as explained, but Abbt makes connections by numerous rhetorical flourishes and examples drawn from history within social orders in monarchical society, reorienting citizenship around a political virtue. He wants his readers to be able to take what he is saying from this book and take action in becoming a stronger community or whole. Abbt argues that love of fatherland is a greater spring to action in polity; to enable souls in a polity by honoring the love of fatherland. With more souls taking actions, the stronger and more love the fatherland will feel, which could lead them to be more successful. This was a main message throughout the book, as he wanted to show a new way of thinking between individuals and society.

The example of King fighting for his country on the battlefield that Abbt wrote about was to inspire monarchical subjects to follow his example as well as regenerate patriotism. He wrote as a pervasive patriotic culture of remembrance and emulation of dead heroes.

==Who influenced or was influenced by Abbt==
Aufklärer like Abbt were concerned with nurturing a healthy social organism with their own individual development and emancipation. Other writers and philosophers such as Prussian philosopher Immanuel Kant tried tying &quot;Enlightenment&quot; directly to &quot;Problem of Publikum&quot;, but found difficulty in the isolated individual. This project was begun by Abbt, which was carried on by Immanuel Kant and Johann Gottfried Herder who had different thoughts on it. Herder differed from Kant&#x27;s more rationalist project, but the statues of the &quot;Problem of Publikum&quot; was a problem of the Aufklärer and of modern German history.

In the early 1760s Abbt and Moses Mendelssohn had been engaged in a translation of Shaftesbury, as they express their interest in the &quot;public&quot; as the measure of all &quot;true&quot; virtue. Alexander Pope has an impact on Abbt through his visions of world and society as an ordered whole, which helped influence him to write &quot;On Dying for the Fatherland&quot;. Abbt argues that Pope&#x27;s teaching point to him was &quot;the principle that makes us obedient to the creator, and into citizens of the whole world&quot;. Certain principles that Abbt wanted to take away from Pope were that he wanted the German people to either take leadership or make sure they obey their leader, in the good for their country. In Abbt&#x27;s short life, the figure of Frederick the Great looms over the text in this regard as Abbt admired him very much. He was then able to rise to the top of German academic life, to a position of an enlightened administration, as he &quot;died for Germany and for his language too early&quot; as he was looked at as a true positive influential model to the German society.

==Main message sent to his readers==
Between Abbt&#x27;s two famous works of &quot;On Dying for the Fatherland (1761) and &quot;On Merit&quot; (1765), he tries to &quot;overcome the basic German problem of a fragmented public sphere with enlightened argument designed to lead readers to locate themselves and their well-being in an enlarged societal frame.&quot; As he tried to fix this German problem within the public, his enlightened argument is pointed at people in leadership positions or people that have the opportunity to make a difference, in doing something positive for their community around them.

Abbt wrote that Germans lack a common interest, as he asks about the &quot;volk&quot; even though you are not supposed to ask about the &quot;volk&quot; as you are supposed to let it be as it has to pay for its dues. But, he wanted to show his readers what not to do by mentioning them.

The main message he wanted to get to his readers in &quot;On Dying for the Fatherland&quot;, was to rouse fellow-citizenship to sacrificial duty for their Fatherland. Just like &quot;The Merit&quot;, this novel brings readers a sense of their place or role in a larger society. Abbt emphasizes the equality of all members of society, as it is a common theme that also leads into &quot;The Merit&quot;. He keeps this common theme present because he believes that the characteristics of great women, are found in great men as well, which helps influence his readers to take positive actions. Another main message from the novel of &quot;On Dying for the Fatherland&quot; was to sacrifice duty to their fatherland, reading in context of the Seven Years&#x27; War. This war had a large impact on Abbt, as it occurred while he made his most famous wiritngs, and was a present event for a quarter of his lifetime. The Seven Years&#x27; War was also an event that influenced Abbt&#x27;s writing, especially &quot;On Dying for the Fatherland&quot;, which is why he discusses protecting your homeland so much, along with encouraging people to take action in making positive impacts. He wanted to bring his readers to a sense of their place or role in the larger societal whole, by inspiring virtuous action based. Abbt&#x27;s purpose was to help the reader see the presence of a fatherland in &quot;well-ordered monarchies&quot;.

As Abbt reassures the reader that there is no reason to worry about dissolution of the corporate orders in the novel, &quot;On Dying for the Fatherland&quot; the readers have their own reasons for being that will continue to justify their existence. He also touches base a lot on citizenship, as he describes that in a state of war that nothing during the war takes away from their bonds. Abbt, Moses Mendelssohn, and Shaftesbury wanted to emphasize the social solidarity to the readers to make sure that if their readers are taking their writing seriously, that they will take action in creating a psychological sense of unity in groups or classes.

== Abbt receiving recognition ==
Abbt was honored for being the writer of &quot;The Publikum&quot; and a teacher of virtue and innocence, where people understood his points and listened to them. He took Professorship in Philosophy in 1760, which is when he wrote famous novel, &quot;On Dying for the Fatherland&quot;, brought Abbt a lot of instant recognition. After writing it, he came into contact with Aufklärer and Moses Mendelssohn, who asked him to become a regular contributor to the &quot;letters concerning the newest literature&quot;. In accepting this offer, Abbt&#x27;s work became more public and often more present to readers eyes, where he could have easier access in influencing people. This novel also gave him the title of a full professorship in mathematics at the University of Rinteln.

In 1765, when Abbt published his famous and most important work of &quot;The Merit&quot;, it brought interest from Margrave of Schaumburg-Lippe the enlightened Prince at the time offered Abbt a position in court. He accepted this offer and spent the last year of his life working with the Prince. The Prince bestowed on him the office on counsellor of the court, regency, and consistory of Buckeburgh. The Margrave of Schaumburg-Lippe caused Abbt to be interred, with great pomp, in his private chapel, and honoured his tomb by an affecting epitaph from his own pen.

In Abbt&#x27;s life he rose to the top of German academics at such a young age which moved to a position of enlightened administration and free scholarly activity. He had so much going for him at the age of 28 as he could have influenced so many more people and learned much more if it were not for the sudden illness that led to his death.

<text>A safety-critical system or life-critical system is a system whose failure or malfunction may result in one (or more) of the following outcomes:

* death or serious injury to people
* loss or severe damage to equipment/property
* environmental harm

A safety-related system (or sometimes safety-involved system) comprises everything (hardware, software, and human aspects) needed to perform one or more safety functions, in which failure would cause a significant increase in the safety risk for the people or environment involved. Safety-related systems are those that do not have full responsibility for controlling hazards such as loss of life, severe injury or severe environmental damage. The malfunction of a safety-involved system would only be that hazardous in conjunction with the failure of other systems or human error. Some safety organizations provide guidance on safety-related systems, for example the Health and Safety Executive in the United Kingdom.

Risks of this sort are usually managed with the methods and tools of safety engineering. A safety-critical system is designed to lose less than one life per billion (109) hours of operation. Typical design methods include probabilistic risk assessment, a method that combines failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) with fault tree analysis. Safety-critical systems are increasingly computer-based.

Safety-critical systems are a concept often used together with the Swiss cheese model to represent (usually in a bow-tie diagram) how a threat can escalate to a major accident through the failure of multiple critical barriers. This use has become common especially in the domain of process safety, in particular when applied to oil and gas drilling and production both for illustrative purposes and to support other processes, such as asset integrity management and incident investigation. 

==Reliability regimens==
Several reliability regimes for safety-critical systems exist:

* Fail-operational systems continue to operate when their control systems fail. Examples of these include elevators, the gas thermostats in most home furnaces, and passively safe nuclear reactors. Fail-operational mode is sometimes unsafe. Nuclear weapons launch-on-loss-of-communications was rejected as a control system for the U.S. nuclear forces because it is fail-operational: a loss of communications would cause launch, so this mode of operation was considered too risky. This is contrasted with the fail-deadly behavior of the Perimeter system built during the Soviet era.
* Fail-soft systems are able to continue operating on an interim basis with reduced efficiency in case of failure. Most spare tires are an example of this: They usually come with certain restrictions (e.g. a speed restriction) and lead to lower fuel economy. Another example is the &quot;Safe Mode&quot; found in most Windows operating systems.
* Fail-safe systems become safe when they cannot operate. Many medical systems fall into this category. For example, an infusion pump can fail, and as long as it alerts the nurse and ceases pumping, it will not threaten the loss of life because its safety interval is long enough to permit a human response. In a similar vein, an industrial or domestic burner controller can fail, but must fail in a safe mode (i.e. turn combustion off when they detect faults). Famously, nuclear weapon systems that launch-on-command are fail-safe, because if the communications systems fail, launch cannot be commanded. Railway signaling is designed to be fail-safe.
* Fail-secure systems maintain maximum security when they cannot operate. For example, while fail-safe electronic doors unlock during power failures, fail-secure ones will lock, keeping an area secure.
* Fail-Passive systems continue to operate in the event of a system failure. An example includes an aircraft autopilot. In the event of a failure, the aircraft would remain in a controllable state and allow the pilot to take over and complete the journey and perform a safe landing.
* Fault-tolerant systems avoid service failure when faults are introduced to the system. An example may include control systems for ordinary nuclear reactors. The normal method to tolerate faults is to have several computers continually test the parts of a system, and switch on hot spares for failing subsystems. As long as faulty subsystems are replaced or repaired at normal maintenance intervals, these systems are considered safe. The computers, power supplies and control terminals used by human beings must all be duplicated in these systems in some fashion.

==Software engineering for safety-critical systems==
Software engineering for safety-critical systems is particularly difficult. There are three aspects which can be applied to aid the engineering software for life-critical systems. First is process engineering and management. Secondly, selecting the appropriate tools and environment for the system. This allows the system developer to effectively test the system by emulation and observe its effectiveness. Thirdly, address any legal and regulatory requirements, such as Federal Aviation Administration requirements for aviation. By setting a standard for which a system is required to be developed under, it forces the designers to stick to the requirements. The avionics industry has succeeded in producing standard methods for producing life-critical avionics software. Similar standards exist for industry, in general, (IEC 61508) and automotive (ISO 26262), medical (IEC 62304) and nuclear (IEC 61513) industries specifically. The standard approach is to carefully code, inspect, document, test, verify and analyze the system. Another approach is to certify a production system, a compiler, and then generate the system&#x27;s code from specifications. Another approach uses formal methods to generate proofs that the code meets requirements. All of these approaches improve the software quality in safety-critical systems by testing or eliminating manual steps in the development process, because people make mistakes, and these mistakes are the most common cause of potential life-threatening errors.

<text>Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Maslama () (c. ? – c. 1045), surnamed Ibn al-Aftas, was the founder of the Aftasid dynasty of the taifa of Badajoz, in what was then Al-Andalus. He was a miknasa berber from the Córdoba region. Ibn al-Aftas became the vizier of Sabur al-Saqlabi, a former slave of Caliph al-Hakam II, who became prince of the lower march of the former Caliphate of Cordoba. On the death of Sabur in 1022, Ibn al-Aftas seized power, and Badajoz under his leadership, became the capital of a principality centered on Guadiana and extending over central Portugal. He was a prominent military tactician and was surnamed &quot;Al-Mansur&quot; (the victorious). He died about 1045 AD.

<text>Haslev is a railway town in the southern part of the island of Zealand, Denmark, located about southwest of Copenhagen. It has a population of 12,488 (1 January 2024), and is the largest town in Faxe Municipality in Region Zealand. 

Haslev has six public schools: two boarding schools, a folk high school, a technical school, a college of education, and a sixth-form college.

The estates and castles of Gisselfeld and Bregentved are close to Haslev.

==History==
Haslev started out being a small village named Hasle with a few houses and streets surrounding the church. It is mentioned for the first time in 1328 as &quot;Haslæ&quot; and in the Bishop of Roskilde&#x27;s Urbarium 1370-80 as &quot;Hasle&quot; and &quot;Haslæ&quot;. The name was later changed to Haslev to avoid confusion with other similar town names in Denmark.

In 1870, the railway line passing Haslev town was inaugurated. At that time, Haslev had only 653 inhabitants. A street named Jernbanegade (Railway Street) was paved, to connect the church with the newly built train station. In the years that followed, the street became the main street of the town with shops, banks and so forth. In 1911, the town had 3,668 inhabitants. In the 1980s, a square in the middle of the street was constructed.

During the 20th century Haslev grew rapidly, becoming a center for the Church Association for the Inner Mission in Denmark. The latter built a folk high school, sixth-form college (with a boarding school) among others. In the 1970s and 1980s, the schools became independent of the founding association. Today, there are only few remains of the Inner Mission in Haslev.

In the early 1970s and onwards, an entrepreneur named Ole Christiansen founded whole new neighbourhoods of one-family houses with an attached garden at a low expense. This encouraged many families from all over Zealand, and especially Copenhagen, to move to Haslev.

Nobel-Prize winner Jens Christian Skou studied at Haslev Gymnasium (college) in his youth. In 1997, he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of Na+,K+-ATPase

Prior to 1 January 2007, Haslev was a town in Haslev Municipality (&quot;kommune&quot;). On 1 January 2007 Haslev as the result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007), became a town in Faxe municipality.

==Transport==

Haslev is served by Haslev railway station which is connected to and and the rest of the Danish rail network by the Little South railway line. Busses run from the station to neighbouring towns, villages and areas.

European road E47 passes a short distance east of Haslev.

<text>A bastion is a structure projecting outward from the curtain wall of a fortification, most commonly angular in shape and positioned at the corners of the fort. The fully developed bastion consists of two faces and two flanks, with fire from the flanks being able to protect the curtain wall and the adjacent bastions. Compared with the medieval fortified towers they replaced, bastion fortifications offered a greater degree of passive resistance and more scope for ranged defence in the age of gunpowder artillery. As military architecture, the bastion is one element in the style of fortification dominant from the mid 16th to mid 19th centuries.

By the middle of the 15th century, artillery pieces had become powerful enough to make the traditional medieval round tower and curtain wall obsolete. This was exemplified by the campaigns of Charles VII of France who reduced the towns and castles held by the English during the latter stages of the Hundred Years War, and by the fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the large cannon of the Turkish army.

During the Eighty Years War (1568–1648) Dutch military engineers developed the concepts further by lengthening the faces and shortening the curtain walls of the bastions. The resulting construction was called a &quot;bolwerk&quot;. To augment this change they placed v-shaped outworks known as ravelins in front of the bastions and curtain walls to protect them from direct artillery fire.

These ideas were further developed and incorporated into the &quot;trace italienne&quot; forts by Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, that remained in use during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Effectiveness==

Bastions differ from medieval towers in a number of respects. Bastions are lower than towers and are normally of similar height to the adjacent curtain wall. The height of towers, although making them difficult to scale, also made them easy for artillery to destroy. A bastion would normally have a ditch in front, the opposite side of which would be built up above the natural level then slope away gradually. This glacis shielded most of the bastion from the attacker&#x27;s cannon while the distance from the base of the ditch to the top of the bastion meant it was still difficult to scale.
In contrast to typical late medieval towers, bastions (apart from early examples) were flat sided rather than curved. This eliminated dead ground making it possible for the defenders to fire upon any point directly in front of the bastion.

Bastions also cover a larger area than most towers. This allows more cannons to be mounted and provided enough space for the crews to operate them.

Surviving examples of bastions are usually faced with masonry. Unlike the wall of a tower this was just a retaining wall; cannonballs were expected to pass through this and be absorbed by a greater thickness of hard-packed earth or rubble behind. The top of the bastion was exposed to enemy fire, and normally would not be faced with masonry as cannonballs hitting the surface would scatter lethal stone shards among the defenders.

If a bastion was successfully stormed, it could provide the attackers with a stronghold from which to launch further attacks. Some bastion designs attempted to minimise this problem. This could be achieved by the use of retrenchments in which a trench was dug across the rear (gorge) of the bastion, isolating it from the main rampart.

==Types==

Various kinds of bastions have been used throughout history:
* Solid bastions are those that are filled up entirely and have the ground even with the height of the rampart, without any empty space towards the centre.
* Void or hollow bastions are those that have a rampart, or parapet, only around their flanks and faces, so that a void space is left towards the centre. The ground is so low, that if the rampart is taken, no retrenchment can be made in the centre, but what will lie under the fire of the besieged.
* A flat bastion is one built in the middle of a curtain, or enclosed court, when the court is too large to be defended by the bastions at its extremes.
* A cut bastion is that which has a re-entering angle at the point. It was sometimes also called bastion with a tenaille. Such bastions were used, when without such a structure, the angle would be too acute. The term cut bastion is also used for one that is cut off from the place by some ditch.
* A composed bastion is when the two sides of the interior polygon are very unequal, which also makes the gorges unequal.
* A regular bastion is that which has proportionate faces, flanks, and gorges, such as the octagonal bastion the symbol of the town of Nanaimo in British Columbia.
* A deformed or irregular bastion is one which lacks one of its demi-gorges; one side of the interior polygon being too short.
* A demi-bastion has only one face and flank. To fortify the angle of a place that is too acute, they cut the point, and place two demi-bastions, which make a tenaille, or re-entry angle. Their chief use is before a hornwork or crownwork.

<text>The Hoover Institution (officially The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution, and Peace and formerly The Hoover Institute and Library on War, Revolution, and Peace) is an American public policy think tank which promotes personal and economic liberty, free enterprise, and limited government. While the institution is formally a unit of Stanford University, it maintains an independent board of overseers and relies on its own income and donations. It is widely described as conservative, although its directors have contested the idea that it is partisan.

The institution began in 1919 as a library founded by Stanford alumnus Herbert Hoover prior to his presidency in order to house his archives gathered during the Great War. The well-known Hoover Tower was built to house the archives, then known as the Hoover War Collection (now the Hoover Institution Library and Archives), and contained material related to World War I, World War II, and other global events. The collection was renamed and transformed into a research institution (&quot;think tank&quot;) during the mid-20th century. Its mission, as described by Herbert Hoover in 1959, is &quot;to recall the voice of experience against the making of war, and by the study of these records and their publication, to recall man&#x27;s endeavors to make and preserve peace, and to sustain for America the safeguards of the American way of life.&quot;

It has staffed numerous jobs in Washington for Republican presidents from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump. It has provided work for people who previously had important government jobs. Notable Hoover fellows and alumni include Nobel Prize laureates Henry Kissinger, Milton Friedman, and Gary Becker; economist Thomas Sowell; scholars Niall Ferguson and Richard Epstein; former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich; and former Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis. In 2020, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice became the institution&#x27;s director. It divides its fellows into separate research teams to work on various subjects, including Economic Policy, History, Education, and Law. It publishes research by its own university press, the Hoover Institution Press.

In 2021, Hoover was ranked as the 10th most influential think tank in the world by &quot;Academic Influence&quot;. It was ranked 22nd on the &quot;Top Think Tanks in United States&quot; and 1st on the &quot;Top Think Tanks to Look Out For&quot; lists of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program that same year.

==History==
===Founding===
In June 1919, Herbert Hoover, then a wealthy engineer who was one of Stanford University&#x27;s first graduates, sent a telegram offering Stanford president Ray Lyman Wilbur $50,000 in order to assist the collection of primary materials related to World War I, a project that became known as the Hoover War Collection. Assisted primarily by gifts from private donors, the Hoover War Collection flourished during its early years. In 1922, the collection became known as the Hoover War Library, now known as the Hoover Institution Library and Archives, and includes a variety of rare and unpublished material, including the files of the &quot;Okhrana&quot; and a plurality of government documents produced during the war. It was housed originally in the Stanford Library, separate from the general stacks. In his memoirs, Hoover wrote:

I did a vast amount of reading, mostly on previous wars, revolutions, and peace-makings of Europe and especially the political and economic aftermaths. At one time I set up some research at London, Paris, and Berlin into previous famines in Europe to see if there had developed any ideas on handling relief and pestilence. ... I was shortly convinced that gigantic famine would follow the present war. The steady degeneration of agriculture was obvious. ... I read in one of Andrew D. White&#x27;s writings that most of the fugitive literature of comment during the French Revolution was lost to history because no one set any value on it at the time, and that without such material it became very difficult or impossible to reconstruct the real scene. Therein lay the origins of the Library on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University.
===20th century===
By 1926, the Hoover War Library was the largest library in the world devoted to World War I, including 1.4 million items and too large to house in the Stanford University Library, so the university allocated $600,000 for the construction of the Hoover Tower, which was designed to be its permanent home independent of the Stanford Library system. The 285-foot tall tower was completed in 1941 on date of the university&#x27;s golden jubilee. The tower has since been a well-recognized part of the Stanford campus.

In 1956, former President Hoover, in conjunction with the Institution and Library, began a major fundraising campaign that transitioned the organization to its current form as a research institution as well as archive.

In 1957, the Hoover Institution and Library was renamed the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, its current name. In 1959, Stanford&#x27;s Board of Trustees officially established the Hoover Institution as &quot;an independent institution within the frame of Stanford University&quot;.

In 1960, W. Glenn Campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon resulted in corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research projects. In particular, the Chinese and Russian collections grew considerably. Despite student unrest during the 1960s, the institution continued to develop closer relations with Stanford University.

In 1975, Ronald Reagan, who was Governor of California at that time, was designated as Hoover&#x27;s first honorary fellow. He donated his gubernatorial papers to the Hoover library. During that time the Hoover Institution had a general budget of $3.5 million a year. In 1976, one third of Stanford University&#x27;s book holdings were housed at the Hoover library. At that time, it was the largest private archive collection in the United States.

For his presidential campaign in 1980, Reagan engaged at least thirteen Hoover scholars to assist the campaign in multiple capacities. After Reagan won the election, more than thirty current or former Hoover Institution fellows worked for the Reagan administration in 1981.

In 1989, Campbell retired as director of Hoover and replaced by John Raisian, a change that was considered the end of an era. Raisan served as director until 2015, and was succeeded by Thomas W. Gilligan.

===21st century===
In 2001, Hoover Senior fellow Condoleezza Rice joined the George W. Bush administration, serving as National Security Advisor from 2001 to 2005 and as Secretary of State from 2005 to 2009. In 2006, President George W. Bush awarded the National Humanities Medal to the Hoover Institution.

In August 2017, the David and Joan Traitel Building was inaugurated. The ground floor is a conference facility with a 400-seat auditorium and the top floor houses the Hoover Institution&#x27;s headquarters.

At any given time, as of 2017, the Hoover Institution has as many as 200 resident scholars known as fellows. They are an interdisciplinary group studying political science, education, economics, foreign policy, energy, history, law, national security, health and politics. Some have joint appointments as lecturers on the Stanford faculty.

The first Trump administration maintained relations with the institution during his presidency, and several Hoover employees became senior advisors or were hired for jobs in his administration, including Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis, who was the Davies Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Hoover from 2013 to 2016, where he studied leadership, national security, strategy, innovation, and the effective use of military force.

In March 2019, Mattis returned to his post at Hoover. Distinguished Visiting Fellow Kevin Hassett became the first chairman of Trump&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisors (CEA). The CEA chief principal economist, Josh Rauh, took leave from his Hoover Institution fellowship. After the third CEA chairman Tyler Goodspeed resigned in 2021, he went to Hoover.

In February 2020, the Hoover board of trustees brought in senior Trump economic officials for off-the-record forecasts. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The president’s aides appeared to be giving wealthy party donors an early warning of a potentially impactful contagion at a time when Mr. Trump was publicly insisting that the threat was nonexistent.&quot; The board members spread the bad news and the stock market had a selloff.

In 2020, Condoleezza Rice succeeded Thomas W. Gilligan as director.

In November 2020, Scott Atlas, a Hoover fellow, was known for opposing public health measures as a major Trump advisor during the COVID-19 pandemic, and was condemned by a Stanford University faculty vote in November 2020.

In January 2021, during Stanford University faculty senate discussions on closer collaboration between the university and the Institution in 2021, Rice &quot;addressed campus criticism that the Hoover Institution is a partisan think tank that primarily supports conservative administrations and policy positions&quot; by sharing &quot;statistics that show Hoover fellows contribute financially to both political parties on an equal basis&quot;, according to the university&#x27;s newsletter.

According to &quot;DeSmog&quot;, the Hoover Institution accepts scientific consensus on climate change, but has long opposed climate action. Some Hoover fellows downplay climate change.

==Campus==
The Institution has libraries which include materials from both World War I and World War II, including the collection of documents of President Herbert Hoover, which he began to collect at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Thousands of Persian books, official documents, letters, multimedia pieces and other materials on Iran&#x27;s history, politics and culture can also be found at the Stanford University library and the Hoover Institution library.
==Publications==

The Hoover Institution&#x27;s in-house publisher, Hoover Institution Press, produces publications on public policy topics, including the quarterly periodicals &quot;Hoover Digest&quot;, &quot;Education Next&quot;, &quot;China Leadership Monitor&quot;, and &quot;Defining Ideas&quot;. The Hoover Institution Press previously published the bimonthly periodical &quot;Policy Review&quot;, which it acquired from The Heritage Foundation in 2001. &quot;Policy Review&quot; ceased publication with its February–March 2013 issue.

The Hoover Institution Press also publishes books and essays by Hoover Institution fellows and other Hoover-affiliated scholars.

==Funding==
The Hoover Institution receives nearly half of its funding from private gifts, primarily from individual contributions, and the other half from its endowment.

Funders of the organization include the Taube Family Foundation, the Koret Foundation, the Howard Charitable Foundation, the Sarah Scaife Foundation, the Walton Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, and the William E. Simon Foundation.

<doc id="286571" wikidata="Q134755" url="?curid=286571" title="Charnia">
<text>Charnia is an extinct genus of frond-like lifeforms belonging to the Ediacaran biota with segmented, leaf-like ridges branching alternately to the right and left from a zig-zag medial suture (thus exhibiting glide reflection, or opposite isometry). The genus &quot;Charnia&quot; was named after Charnwood Forest in Leicestershire, England, where the first fossilised specimen was found; the species was named after Roger Mason, a schoolboy who was believed to have initially discovered it. &quot;Charnia&quot; is significant because it was the first Precambrian fossil to be recognized as such.

The living organism grew on the sea floor, 570 to 550 million years ago, and is believed to have fed on nutrients in the water. Despite &quot;Charnia&quot; fern-like appearance, it is not a photosynthetic plant or alga because the nature of the fossil beds where specimens have been found implies that it originally lived in deep water, well below the photic zone where photosynthesis can occur.

==Diversity==

Several &quot;Charnia&quot; species were described but only the type species &quot;C. masoni&quot; is considered valid. Some specimens of &quot;C. masoni&quot; were described as members of genus &quot;Rangea&quot; or a separate genus &quot;Glaessnerina&quot;:
* &quot;Rangea grandis&quot; Glaessner &amp; Wade, 1966 = &quot;Glaessnerina grandis&quot;
* &quot;Rangea sibirica&quot; Sokolov, 1972 = &quot;Glaessnerina sibirica&quot;

Two other described &quot;Charnia&quot; species have been transferred to two separate genera
* &quot;Charnia wardi&quot; Narbonne &amp; Gehling, 2003 transferred to the genus &quot;Trepassia&quot; Narbonne &quot;et al.&quot;, 2009
* &quot;Charnia antecedens&quot; Laflamme &quot;et al.&quot;, 2007 transferred to the genus &quot;Vinlandia&quot; Brasier, Antcliffe &amp; Liu, 2012

A number of Ediacaran form taxa are thought to represent &quot;Charnia&quot;, &quot;Charniodiscus&quot; and other Petalonamids at varying levels of decay; these include the Ivesheadiomorphs &quot;Ivesheadia&quot;, &quot;Blackbrookia&quot;, &quot;Pseudovendia&quot;, and &quot;Shepshedia&quot;.

==Distribution==

&quot;Charnia masoni&quot; was first described from the Maplewell Group in Charnwood Forest in England and was subsequently found in Ediacara Hills in Australia, Siberia and the White Sea area in Russia, and Precambrian deposits in Newfoundland, Canada.

It lived about 570-550 million years ago.

==Discovery==

&quot;Charnia masoni&quot; was brought to the attention of scientists by Roger Mason, a schoolboy who later became a professor of metamorphic petrology. In 1957 Mason and his friends were rock-climbing in Charnwood Forest, in what is now a protected fossil site in Central England. They noticed this unusual fossil, and Mason took a rubbing of the rock. He showed the rubbing to his father, the minister of Leicester&#x27;s Great Meeting Unitarian Chapel, who also taught at Leicester University nearby and knew Trevor Ford, a local geologist. Mason took Ford to the site; Ford published the discovery in the &quot;Journal of the Yorkshire Geological Society&quot;. The holotype (the actual physical example from which the species was first described) now resides, along with a cast of the related taxon &quot;Charniodiscus&quot;, in Leicester Museum &amp; Art Gallery. 

It has also been revealed that Tina Negus, then a 15-year-old schoolgirl, had seen this fossil a year before the boys but her geography schoolteacher discounted the possibility of Precambrian fossils. Mason acknowledges, and the museum&#x27;s Charnia display explains, that the fossil had been discovered a year earlier by Negus, &quot;but no one took her seriously&quot;. She was recognised at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the official discovery.

== Significance==

&quot;Charnia&quot; is known from specimens as small as only , and as large as in length. It is a very significant fossil because it is the first fossil which was ever described to have come from undoubted Precambrian rocks. Prior to 1958, the Precambrian was thought to be completely devoid of fossils and consequently possibly devoid of macroscopic life. Similar fossils had been found during the 1930s (in Namibia) and the 1940s (in Australia) but these forms were assumed to be of Cambrian age and were therefore considered unremarkable at the time. Originally interpreted as an alga, &quot;Charnia&quot; was reinterpreted as a sea pen (a group related to the modern soft corals) from 1966 onwards. Acceptance of &quot;Charnia&quot; as a Precambrian lifeform resulted in recognition of other major Precambrian animal groups, although the sea pen interpretation of &quot;Charnia&quot; has been recently discredited, and the current &quot;state of the art&quot; is something of a &quot;statement of ignorance&quot;.

An alternative theory has developed, since the mid-1980s, from the work of Adolf Seilacher who suggested that &quot;Charnia&quot; belongs to an extinct group of unknown grade which was confined to the Ediacaran Period. This suggests that almost all the forms that have been postulated to be members of many and various modern animal groups are actually more closely related to each other than they are to anything else. This new group was termed the Vendobionta, a clade with unknown relationship to other clades, perhaps united by its construction via unipolar iterations of one cell family.

The holotype is a major attraction at the Leicester Museum &amp; Art Gallery. A day-long seminar in 2007 devoted to &quot;Charnia&quot; termed it &quot;Leicester&#x27;s fossil celebrity&quot;.

==Ecology==
Little is known about the ecology of &quot;Charnia&quot;. It was benthic and sessile, anchored to the sea floor. According to one currently popular hypothesis, it probably lived in deep waters, well below the wave base, thus placing it out of range of photosynthesis. Furthermore, it has no obvious feeding apparatus (mouth, gut, etc.) so its lifestyle remains enigmatic. Some have speculated that it survived either by filter feeding or directly absorbing nutrients, and this is currently the emphasis of considerable research.

The growth and development of the Ediacara biota is also a subject of continued research, and this has discredited the sea pen hypothesis. In contrast to sea pens, which grow by basal insertion, &quot;Charnia&quot; grew by the apical insertion of new buds.
