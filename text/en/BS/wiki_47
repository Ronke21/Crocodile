<text>Sir Rodmond Palen Roblin (February 15, 1853 – February 16, 1937) was a businessman and politician in Manitoba, Canada.

==Early life and career==
Roblin was born in Sophiasburgh, in Prince Edward County, Canada West (later Ontario). The Roblin family was established in Sophiasburgh by the Loyalist farmers Philip and Elizabeth Roblin from Smith&#x27;s Clove (now known as Monroe) in Orange County, New York. He was educated at Albert College in Belleville, arrived in Winnipeg in 1877, and worked as a grain merchant. Roblin served as reeve of Dufferin for five years and as warden for two and was also a school trustee in the community.

He entered provincial politics in the 1886 Manitoba election, running as a Liberal Party candidate against the Conservative cabinet minister David H. Wilson in the constituency of Dufferin North. He lost the race by five votes but won a subsequent by-election held on May 12, 1888.

The by-election took place shortly after Thomas Greenway had been inaugurated as Manitoba&#x27;s first Liberal premier. Roblin was then a supporter of Greenway and was re-elected by acclamation when the new premier called another provincial election for July 1888.

Although Greenway&#x27;s Liberals won the election with a landslide majority, the new premier was unable to fulfill a campaign promise for the development of local railways. The Canadian Pacific Railway had lost its formal monopoly in the region, but it remained the dominant line, and transportation costs remained high. Confronted with Greenway&#x27;s failure, Roblin abandoned the government in 1889 and caucused with the small Conservative opposition. With the death of John Norquay in the same year, Roblin emerged as the party&#x27;s leading spokesman and was the Conservative Party&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader in the legislature between 1890 and 1892.

In opposition, Roblin spoke against Greenway&#x27;s proposed education reforms. After his failure to reform the provincial railway system, Greenway repudiated an earlier pledge and withdrew state support for Manitoba&#x27;s Catholic and francophone education system. His reforms triggered a national political crisis known as the Manitoba Schools Question. Many Canadian francophones regarded Greenway&#x27;s policy as discriminatory, but it was extremely popular with Manitoba&#x27;s anglophone and Protestant majority. Greenway&#x27;s government was re-elected in the 1892 election, and Roblin was personally defeated in the rural constituency, including the town of Morden.

Greenway won another landslide victory in the 1896 election, but Roblin was this time returned to the legislature for the constituency of Woodlands. He became the parliamentary leader of the Conservatives for a second time but stood aside to allow Hugh John Macdonald to become the official leader of the party in 1897.

The 1899 provincial election was very different from the previous two campaigns. The schools question had been resolved in 1896, and Greenway was forced to defend a fairly-mediocre record on other issues against a more organized opposition. The result was a narrow victory for Macdonald&#x27;s Conservatives, who won 22 of 40 seats. Macdonald was inaugurated as premier early in 1900. Roblin, who was re-elected in Woodlands, but despite being was the main architect of the Conservative victory, he was left out of cabinet.

==Premiership==
Macdonald resigned as premier on October 29, 1900, to run for the Conservative Party of Canada against Clifford Sifton in the federal riding of Brandon. Roblin became premier in his place and also took the powerful cabinet position of Railway Commissioner. In December, he also appointed himself as Minister of Agriculture. That consolidation of power reflected Roblin&#x27;s personal authority over both the government and the provincial Conservative Party: his control over both would be unquestioned for 14 years.

While Greenway had won elections on single-issue populism, Roblin relied on machine politics for his electoral success. Despite (or because of) some coercion, he was able to effectively dispense patronage and could rely on the support of many loyal followers at the community level.

Roblin&#x27;s Conservatives won 31 seats in the 1903 election against 9 for Greenway&#x27;s Liberals. The extent of that victory may be credited to Greenway&#x27;s leadership of the Liberal Party since he was increasingly uninterested in provincial politics and was spending much of his time looking for a federal patronage appointment. Roblin&#x27;s machine also coasted to easy victories in 1907 and 1910 by winning 28 of 41 seats on both occasions.

Roblin played a crucial role in the 1911 federal election on reciprocity by putting his electoral machine at the disposal of the federal Conservative Party. Roblin thus helped to defeat Sir Wilfrid Laurier and put Robert Borden in power. Borden in turn enacted legislation to expand Manitoba&#x27;s boundaries to their current limit.

Like his counterpart James Whitney, in Ontario, Roblin expanded the role of government in Manitoba and promoted many initiatives that would be regarded today as progressive. As railway commissioner, he reached an agreement with Canadian Northern Railways to build an alternate route to the lakehead, and he put control of the rates into the hands of the province. His government also promoted significant, expansions in health, education, and road services, all of which were required to service Manitoba&#x27;s rapidly-increasing population.

Roblin created Manitoba&#x27;s first crown corporations by expropriating Bell&#x27;s telephone services to create a state-owned system, the first effective public utilities system in Canada. The government also started a state-owned system of grain elevators to assist farmers, but that was less successful. A scandal involving the elevators weakened his government&#x27;s hold on power in the early 1910s.

Roblin was more conservative on social issues. He is often remembered today for his opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage and for clashing with Nellie McClung on the issue. McClung made Roblin appear foolish in her famous &quot;parliament of women&quot; parodying the premier&#x27;s patronizing comments on traditional gender roles. Roblin also resisted demands to enact a labour code to protect workers and was sometimes reluctant to enforce the province&#x27;s existing legislation.

Roblin is also remembered for folding to pressure from Winnipeg&#x27;s business community. In 1904, he took the step of reducing the ages for child labour and increasing the maximum hours of work for women and children.

Roblin&#x27;s handling of the prohibition issue was also controversial. Macdonald&#x27;s government had passed prohibition legislation in 1900, after two separate referendums had confirmed public support for the initiative. Roblin was reluctant to enforce the legislation, however, because his government received significant revenues from the sale of alcohol. He called a third referendum in 1902. When temperance supporters boycotted the poll, prohibition was defeated by a narrow margin.

The 1914 provincial election was the start of a watershed period in Manitoba politics. Roblin&#x27;s government went into the election weakened by a scandal involving the construction of new legislative buildings. His opponents accused the government of corruption and claimed misappropriation of funds and overspending. The Conservatives were re-elected by a reduced margin by winning 28 seats against 20 for the Liberals in an expanded legislature.

When Roblin rejected calls for a formal investigation into the legislative buildings scandal, the Liberal opposition petitioned the Lieutenant Governor to take direct action. The Lieutenant-Governor convened his own commission of enquiry, popularly known as the Mathers Commission, as it was led by Chief Justice T.A. Mathers. After only two weeks, the commission had uncovered enough evidence to force the government&#x27;s resignation. Roblin formally resigned as premier on May 12, 1915, and the Liberal leader, Tobias Norris, was called to form a new administration. A new general election was called, which the Liberals won a landslide.

==Later life==
The commission&#x27;s report concluded that Roblin, Attorney General James H. Howden, and the developer Thomas Kelly had conspired to commit fraud in the contract arrangements. Roblin was indicted but was eventually discharged of criminal responsibility. He died in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1937.

He is the grandfather of another Manitoba premier, Dufferin Roblin.

<text>A breechloader is a firearm in which the user loads the ammunition from the breech end of the barrel (i.e., from the rearward, open end of the gun&#x27;s barrel), as opposed to a muzzleloader, in which the user loads the ammunition from the (muzzle) end of the barrel.

The vast majority of modern firearms are generally breech-loaders, while firearms made before the mid-19th century were mostly smoothbore muzzle-loaders. Only a few muzzleloading weapons, such as mortars, rifle grenades, some rocket launchers, such as the Panzerfaust 3 and RPG-7, and the GP series grenade launchers, have remained in common usage in modern military conflicts. However, referring to a weapon explicitly as breech-loading is mostly limited to weapons where the operator loads ammunition by hand (and not by operating a mechanism such as a bolt-action), such as artillery pieces or break-action small arms.

Breech-loading provides the advantage of reduced reloading time because it is far quicker to load the projectile and propellant into the chamber of a gun or cannon than to reach all the way over to the front end to load ammunition and then push them back down a long tube – especially when the projectile fits tightly and the tube has spiral ridges from rifling. In field artillery, the advantages were similar – crews no longer had to get in front of the gun and pack ammunition in the barrel with a ramrod, and the shot could now tightly fit the bore, greatly increasing its power, range, and accuracy. It also made it easier to load a previously fired weapon with a fouled barrel. Gun turrets and emplacements for breechloaders can be smaller since crews don&#x27;t need to retract the gun for loading into the muzzle end. Unloading a breechloader is much easier as well, as the ammunition can be unloaded from the breech end and is often doable by hand; unloading muzzle loaders requires drilling into the projectile to drag it out through the whole length of the barrel, and in some cases the guns are simply fired to facilitate unloading process.

The advent of breech-loading gave a significant increase to effective firepower by its own right, and also enabled further revolutions in firearm designs such as repeating and self-loading firearms.

==History==
Although breech-loading firearms were developed as far back as the early 14th century in Burgundy and various other parts of Europe, breech-loading became more successful with improvements in precision engineering and machining in the 19th century.

The main challenge for developers of breech-loading firearms was sealing the breech. This was eventually solved for smaller firearms by the development of the self-contained metallic cartridge in the mid-19th century. For firearms too large to use cartridges, the problem was solved by the development of the interrupted screw.

===Swivel guns===

Breech-loading swivel guns were invented in the 14th century. They were a particular type of swivel gun, and consisted in a small breech-loading cannon equipped with a swivel for easy rotation, loaded by inserting a mug-shaped chamber already filled with powder and projectiles. The breech-loading swivel gun had a high rate of fire, and was especially effective in anti-personnel roles.

===Firearms===


Breech-loading firearms are known from the 16th century. Henry VIII possessed one, which he apparently used as a hunting gun to shoot birds. Meanwhile, in China, an early form of breech-loading musket, known as the Che Dian Chong, was known to have been created in the second half of the 16th century for the Ming dynasty&#x27;s arsenals. Like all early breech-loading fireams, gas leakage was a limitation and danger present in the weapon&#x27;s mechanism.

More breech-loading firearms were made in the early 18th century. One such gun known to have belonged to Philip V of Spain, and was manufactured circa 1715, probably in Madrid. It came with a ready-to load reusable cartridge.

Patrick Ferguson, a British Army officer, developed in 1772 the Ferguson rifle, a breech-loading flintlock firearm. Roughly two hundred of the rifles were manufactured and used in the Battle of Brandywine, during the American Revolutionary War, but shortly after they were retired and replaced with the standard Brown Bess musket. In turn the American army, after getting some experience with muzzle-loaded rifles in the late 18th century, adopted the first standard breech-loading rifle in the world, M1819 Hall rifle, and in larger numbers than the Ferguson rifle.

About the same time and later on into the mid-19th century, there were attempts in Europe at an effective breech-loader. There were concentrated attempts at improved cartridges and methods of ignition.

In Paris in 1808, in association with French gunsmith François Prélat, Jean Samuel Pauly created the first fully self-contained cartridges: the cartridges incorporated a copper base with integrated mercury fulminate primer powder (the major innovation of Pauly), a round bullet and either brass or paper casing. The cartridge was loaded through the breech and fired with a needle. The needle-activated central-fire breech-loading gun would become a major feature of firearms thereafter. The corresponding firearm was also developed by Pauly. Pauly made an improved version, which was protected by a patent on 29 September 1812.

The Pauly cartridge was further improved by the French gunsmith Casimir Lefaucheux in 1828, by adding a pinfire primer, but Lefaucheux did not register his patent until 1835: a pinfire cartridge containing powder in a cardboard shell.

In 1845, another Frenchman Louis-Nicolas Flobert invented, for indoor shooting, the first rimfire metallic cartridge, constituted by a bullet fit in a percussion cap. Usually derived in the 6 mm and 9 mm calibres, it is since then called the Flobert cartridge but it does not contain any powder; the only propellant substance contained in the cartridge is the percussion cap itself. In English-speaking countries the Flobert cartridge corresponds to the .22 BB and .22 CB ammunitions.

In 1846, yet another Frenchman, Benjamin Houllier, patented the first fully metallic cartridge containing powder in a metallic shell. Houllier commercialised his weapons in association with the gunsmiths Blanchard or Charles Robert. But the subsequent Houllier and Lefaucheux cartridges, even if they were the first full-metal shells, were still pinfire cartridges, like those used in the LeMat (1856) and Lefaucheux (1858) revolvers, although the LeMat also evolved in a revolver using rimfire cartridges.

The first centrefire cartridge was introduced in 1855 by Pottet, with both Berdan and Boxer priming.

In 1842, the Norwegian Armed Forces adopted the breech-loading caplock, the Kammerlader, one of the first instances in which a modern army widely adopted a breech-loading rifle as its main infantry firearm.

The &quot;Dreyse Zündnadelgewehr&quot; (Dreyse needle gun) was a single-shot breech-loading rifle using a rotating bolt to seal the breech. It was so called because of its .5-inch needle-like firing pin, which passed through a paper cartridge case to impact a percussion cap at the bullet base. It began development in the 1830s under Johann Nicolaus von Dreyse and eventually an improved version of it was adopted by Prussia in the late 1840s. The paper cartridge and the gun had numerous deficiencies; specifically, serious problems with gas leaking. However, the rifle was used to great success in the Prussian army in the Austro-Prussian war of 1866. This, and the Franco-Prussian war of 1870–71, eventually caused much interest in Europe for breech-loaders and the Prussian military system in general.

In 1860, the New Zealand government petitioned the Colonial Office for more soldiers to defend Auckland. The bid was unsuccessful and the government began instead making inquiries to Britain to obtain modern weapons. In 1861 they placed orders for the Calisher and Terry carbine, which used a breech-loading system using a bullet consisting of a standard Minié lead bullet in .54 calibre backed by a charge and tallowed wad, wrapped in nitrated paper to keep it waterproof. The carbine had been issued in small numbers to English cavalry (Hussars) from 1857. About 3–4,000 carbines were brought into New Zealand a few years later. The carbine was used extensively by the Forest Rangers, an irregular force led by Gustavus von Tempsky that specialized in bush warfare and reconnaissance. Von Tempsky liked the short carbine, which could be loaded while lying down. The waterproofed cartridge was easier to keep dry in the New Zealand bush. Museums in New Zealand hold a small number of these carbines in good condition.

During the American Civil War, at least nineteen types of breech-loaders were fielded. The Sharps used a successful dropping block design. The Greene used rotating bolt-action, and was fed from the breech. The Spencer, which used lever-actuated bolt-action, was fed from a seven-round detachable tube magazine. The Henry and Volcanic used rimfire metallic cartridges fed from a tube magazine under the barrel. These held a significant advantage over muzzle-loaders. The improvements in breech-loaders had spelled the end of muzzle-loaders. To make use of the enormous number of war surplus muzzle-loaders, the Allin conversion Springfield was adopted in 1866. General Burnside invented a breech-loading rifle before the war, the Burnside carbine.

The French adopted the new Chassepot rifle in 1866, which was much improved over the Dreyse needle gun as it had dramatically fewer gas leaks due to its de Bange sealing system. The British initially took the existing Enfield and fitted it with a Snider breech action (solid block, hinged parallel to the barrel) firing the Boxer cartridge. Following a competitive examination of 104 guns in 1866, the British decided to adopt the Peabody-derived Martini-Henry with trap-door loading in 1871.

Single-shot breech-loaders would be used throughout the latter half of the 19th Century, but were slowly replaced by various designs for repeating rifles, first used in the American Civil War. Manual breech-loaders gave way to manual magazine feed and then to self-loading rifles.

=== Artillery ===

The first modern breech-loading rifled gun is a breech-loader invented by Martin von Wahrendorff with a cylindrical breech plug secured by a horizontal wedge in 1837.
In the 1850s and 1860s, Whitworth and Armstrong invented improved breech-loading artillery.

The M1867 naval guns produced in Imperial Russia at the Obukhov State Plant used Krupp technology.

==Breech mechanism==

A breech action is the loading sequence of a breech loading naval gun or small arm. The earliest breech actions were either three-shot break-open actions or a barrel tip-down, remove the plug and reload actions. The later breech-loaders included the Ferguson rifle, which used a screw-in/screw out action to reload, and the Hall rifle, which tipped up at 30 degrees for loading. The better breech loaders, however, used percussion caps, including the Sharps rifle, using a falling block (or sliding block) action to reload. And then later on came the Dreyse needle gun that used a moving seal (bolt) to seal and expose the breech. Later on, however, the Mauser M71/84 rifle used self-contained metallic cartridges and used a rotating bolt to open and close the breech.

<text>7, Lok Kalyan Marg (7LKM), formerly 7, Race Course Road, is the official residence and principal workplace of the Prime Minister of India. Situated on &quot;Lok Kalyan Marg&quot;, New Delhi, the official name of the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence complex is Panchavati. It is spread over of land, comprising five bungalows in Lutyens&#x27; Delhi, built in the 1980s, which are the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, residency zone and security establishment, including one occupied by Special Protection Group (SPG) and another being a guest house. However, even though there are 5 bungalows, they are collectively called 7, Lok Kalyan Marg. It does not house the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office but has a conference room for informal meetings.

The entire Lok Kalyan Marg, which lies right across the road, is closed to the public. Rajiv Gandhi was the first Prime Minister to reside at the erstwhile 7 Race Course Road, in 1984. It does not house the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO), which is located in the South Block of the Secretariat Building, on Raisina Hill nearby in New Delhi, where the Cabinet Secretariat functions. The nearest Delhi Metro station is Lok Kalyan Marg metro station. When a new Prime Minister is nominated his/her original house is for the time being given a security detail and the new office holder is then advised to move in the 7, LKM at the earliest possible date.

The residence was earlier called &quot;7, Race Course Road&quot;, which changed to &quot;7, Lok Kalyan Marg&quot;, following the renaming of the road on which the house is situated, in September 2016.

==History==
Earlier, the Prime Ministers of India lived in their own house or house allotted to them through Parliament, allotment by virtue of being an MP. Jawaharlal Nehru took up residence in Teen Murti Bhavan, which used to be the residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army in British India; it was formerly called the &quot;Flagstaff House&quot;. After Nehru&#x27;s death in 1964, the building was converted to the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in 1984.

The next Prime Minister of India Lal Bahadur Shastri chose 10 Janpath as his official residence, where he stayed 1964–1966. It was later allotted to the Congress (I) party, though a part of it became biographical museum, Lal Bhadur Shastri Memorial and Museum at 1, Motilal Nehru Place (formerly 10, Janpath), adjacent to the complex. The current resident of 10, Janpath is Former INC President, Sonia Gandhi.

After the assassination of Indira Gandhi at her 1, Safdarjung Road residence garden while going towards neighbouring 1, Akbar Road office for an interview on 31 October 1984, it was converted into the Indira Gandhi Memorial and Museum. Former Chief Justice of India Sudhi Ranjan Das had previously lived at this address before Indira Gandhi.

Rajiv Gandhi, her son and successor as prime minister, along with his wife Sonia Gandhi and children Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, became the first occupant of erstwhile 7, Race Course Road, in 1984.

When V. P. Singh became the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Urban Affairs designated 7, Race Course Road premises occupied by Rajiv Gandhi as the permanent residence and office of the Prime Minister of India to ensure that all successive prime ministers were allotted the same house on assuming office. A government notification on 30 May 1990, officially designated these bungalows as the official residence of Indian Prime Minister.

In the 1990s I. K. Gujral and some of his predecessors, used 7, Race Course Road as Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO).

The 14th and current Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, chose 5, Race Course Road as his residence as the erstwhile 7, Race Course Road was being refurbished at that time, after his predecessor Manmohan Singh had vacated it. The erstwhile 7, Race Course Road was chosen as Modi&#x27;s office.

==Construction==
The bungalows of the 7 LKM were originally designed by Robert Tor Russell, who was part of British architect Edwin Lutyens’ team, when he was designing New Delhi in the 1920s and 1930s.

==The Bungalows==
The Prime Minister&#x27;s residence was built in the 1980s. It does not have his office inside the house, but has a conference room for informal meetings. The Prime Minister&#x27;s residence and office and security spread across five bungalows: Bungalow 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. This includes 5, Lok Kalyan Marg, the Private Residential Zone for the Prime Minister, though he primarily operates from 7, Lok Kalyan Marg.

Bungalow 1 is a helipad for the service of Prime Minister which is being used as so since September 2003. It is under the control of the Special Protection Group. The entire road with bungalows numbering 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 came under Prime Minister&#x27;s residential complex.

Bungalow 3 which was earlier the residence of Dr. Manmohan Singh has now been converted into a guesthouse for Prime Minister&#x27;s guests.

Bungalow 9 is occupied by the Special Protection Group (SPG) that guards the Prime Minister. A tunnel connects the Indian prime minister&#x27;s residence to the Safdarjung Airport, where high-importance helicopters land. Constructed beyond Kemal Atatürk Marg, Golf Course and Safdarjung Tomb and then an overground drive to surface at the helicopter hangar at the airport, work on the tunnel began in 2010 and was completed by July 2014 and Modi was the first Prime Minister to use it.

Current prime minister Narendra Modi uses 5, LKM as his residence which has also been used as so by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Rajiv Gandhi.

===Panchvati===
In 2001, during the tenure of Vajpayee, a state-of-the-art auditorium was constructed at the cost of and was named as &quot;Panchvati&quot;, it has been named after the spot where Ram and Sita had built their hut during their exile. It is equipped for video conferencing and simultaneous translations This can be modelled into 2–3 conference rooms and can also act as a banquet for a gather of 200–340 people. This can be used as a cabinet meeting room and can also be arranged to form a theatre.

===Security===

While the Special Protection Group (SPG) is the primary agency in charge of the security, it is aided by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF) and the Delhi Police to provide three-rung security for the estate. There is only one entrance to 7 Lok Kalyan Marg, which is guarded by the SPG. Only those visitors whose names have been given to SPG by the prime minister&#x27;s personal secretaries are allowed in. The rule applies to everybody, including the national security adviser, top bureaucrats, relatives and guests (barring close family) and visitors are expected to carry an identity card. No outside vehicle is allowed to go beyond the checkpoint and even high-profile visitors including cabinet ministers are required to park their official vehicles by the checkpoint. Special SPG vehicles are used to carry the guests from the checkpoint to the residential office of the Prime Minister. The only exception to this rule is for the SPG protectors themselves who are allowed to take the vehicle carrying them into the complex.

The whole area is a no-fly zone and airspace usage around the area is highly restricted and monitored. Over the years, its security has gradually been increased. A bulletproof glass-tube passage was built in 2003, connecting Bungalow 3, at the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence, to &quot;Panchvati&quot; or 7 LKM, where the Prime Minister meets people and delegations and holds official meetings. A concrete wall was added on the periphery, separating the house from the main road, to render any truck bomb or a car bomb attack ineffective. However, the residence is surrounded by various high rise building and public structures, including Samrat Hotel, Ashoka Hotel, and state guesthouses on one side, to the Delhi Gymkhana Club (DCG) and Delhi Race Course which lies on the other. Accordingly, plans for a helipad within the complex were mooted for several years. By 2004, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) took over most of the rooms of Samrat Hotel overlooking the residence and watchtowers were erected inside Delhi Gymkhana. The Delhi Gymkhana can be accessed only via Safdarjung Road. The residence has a power substation, and doctors and nurses from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences are on duty round the clock. There are several ambulances on standby, one of which always accompanies the prime minister&#x27;s motorcade. The civic officials ensure that there are no traffic bottlenecks on Kemal Atatürk Marg that runs outside the bungalows.

In 2004, the road was refurbished at a cost of to make it the permanent residence of the Indian Prime Minister.

7 LKM also has massive, manicured lawns and has abundant gulmohar, semal and arjuna trees which homes several birds, including peacocks.

===Staff===

Besides the secretarial staff, it has a support staff of about 200 gardeners, servants, and electricians. They are employed after a background check.

==Workplace==
The workplace at 7 LKM has two small rooms on either side from the entrance for each of the two personal secretaries. Then there is a small corridor with a visitor&#x27;s room to the right. Further ahead is a chamber to meet guests. Adjacent to that is the living space for larger meetings, behind which is the dining room where breakfast and lunch meetings are hosted. A corridor from 7 LKM leads to &quot;Panchvati&quot; which can be segmented into two or three conference rooms or a large banquet hall.

On the walls are artworks loaned by the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA) which are often changed in consultation with the prime minister&#x27;s office. The gifts received by the Prime Minister are either displayed at 7 LKM or are sent to the &quot;toshakhana&quot; (treasure house).

<text>Jean-Baptiste Louis Claude Théodore Leschenault de La Tour (13 November 1773 – 14 March 1826) was a French botanist and ornithologist.

Born at the family seat (since 1718), Le Villard, near Chalon-sur-Saône, Leschenault de la Tour arrived in Paris after the death of his father, a judge at Lyon.

Leschenault de La Tour was chief botanist on Nicolas Baudin&#x27;s expedition to Australia between 1800 and 1803. He collected a great many new specimens in 1801 and 1802, though Baudin&#x27;s journal suggests that he did not work particularly hard; apparently the poorly educated gardener&#x27;s boy Antoine Guichenot collected more plant specimens than Leschenault did, and gave them more useful labels. In April 1803 he was so ill that he had to be put ashore at Timor. Forced to spend the next three years on Java he used the time to make the first thorough botanical investigation of the island, which had not previously been visited by naturalists except briefly by Carl Peter Thunberg. He arrived back in France in July 1807 with a large collection of plants and birds.

Leschenault&#x27;s Javanese birds were described by Georges Cuvier.

Following the Napoleonic Wars, in May 1816 Leschenault travelled to India to collect plants and establish a botanical garden at Pondicherry. He was given permission by the British to travel through Madras, Bengal and Ceylon. He sent many of the plants and seeds he discovered to the French island of Réunion to be cultivated. These included two varieties of sugar cane and six varieties of cotton. He returned to France in 1822 and was awarded the Legion d&#x27;Honneur.

Less than a year after his return Leschenault travelled to South America, visiting Brazil, Surinam and French Guiana, and introducing tea bushes to Cayenne, the capital of the French colony. He was forced to return home after only eighteen months due to ill health.

Though Leschenault published little, his collections were subsequently used by other French botanists, including Aimé Bonpland, René Louiche Desfontaines, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, Jacques Labillardière and Étienne Pierre Ventenat.

==Legacy==
A number of birds were named after Leschenault, including greater sand plover (&quot;Charadrius leschenaultii&quot; ), white-crowned forktail (&quot;Enicurus leschenaulti &quot;), sirkeer malkoha (&quot;Phaenicophaeus leschenaultii&quot; ) and chestnut-headed bee-eater (&quot;Merops leschenaulti&quot;).

Three species of lizards were named after him: &quot;Cryptoblepharus leschenault&quot;, &quot;Hemidactylus leschenaultii&quot;, and &quot;Ophisops leschenaultii&quot;.

The plant genus &quot;Lechenaultia&quot; is also named after him, as well as several Western Australian geographical features including the Leschenault Estuary, the suburb of Leschenault, and Lake Leschenaultia.

<text>The Bearded Collie, or Beardie, is a herding breed of dog once used primarily by Scottish shepherds, but now mostly a popular family companion.

Bearded Collies have an average weight of . Males are around tall at the withers while females are around tall.

==History==

The legend of the Bearded Collie&#x27;s origin is that the ancestors of what is today the Polish Lowland Sheepdog were abandoned on the shores of Scotland, and these dogs then bred with native herding dogs. A variant on this story is that Kazimierz Grabski, a Polish merchant, reportedly traded a shipment of grain for sheep in Scotland in 1514 and brought six Polish Lowland Sheepdogs to move them. A Scottish shepherd was so impressed with the herding ability of the dogs that he traded several sheep for several dogs. The Polish sheepdogs were bred with local Scottish dogs to produce the Bearded Collie.

The first written reference to the Bearded Collie occurs in 1891, when D.J. Thomson Gray describes them in his book &quot;The Dogs of Scotland&quot; as

It is generally agreed that Mrs. G. Olive Willison founded the modern show Bearded Collie in 1944 with her brown bitch, Jeannie of Bothkennar. Jeannie was supposedly a Shetland Sheepdog, but Mrs. Willison received a Bearded Collie by accident. She was so fascinated by the dog that she wanted to begin breeding, so she began searching for a dog for Jeannie. While walking along the beach, Mrs. Willison met a man who was emigrating from Scotland; she became the owner of his grey dog, David, who became Bailie of Bothkennar.

Bailie and Jeannie of Bothkennar are the founders of the modern show breed; there are only a few other registrable blood lines, preserved in large part by the perseverance of Mr. Nicolas Broadbridge (Sallen) and Mrs. Betty Foster (Bredon). These are based on Turnbull&#x27;s Blue—a Bearded Collie from pure working stock, registered in ISDS when ISDS still registered non-Border Collies. He sired three litters of registerable Bearded Collies.

While the registered breed lines can be traced to a limited number of bloodlines, there are still many unregistered Bearded Collies in Scotland, some still working as herding dogs.

The breed became popular during the last half of the 20th century—propelled, in part, by Potterdale Classic at Moonhill, a Bearded Collie who won Best in Show at Crufts in 1989. The Bearded Collie Club celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2005.

==As pets==

The Bearded Collie ranks 117 out of 175 breeds in popularity in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club&#x27;s yearly breed ranking. A Bearded Collie is best obtained from a reputable breeder or a dog rescue. There are Bearded Collie rescue associations, such as Bearded Collie Rescue and &quot;Rescue Me&quot;.

Bearded Collies make excellent pets for those willing to accommodate their high energy level - they are very enthusiastic and have a bouncy nature. They also require regular grooming; weekly brushing is mandatory for keeping their long hair mat-free. Some Bearded Collie owners opt to keep their pets in a &quot;puppy cut&quot; haircut, which reduces the need for brushing. Bearded Collies are an energetic breed, originally intended to work in the Scottish Highlands herding sheep; they also excel at treibball, dog agility and Obedience trials.

==Working life==

The Bearded Collie is used to herd both sheep and cattle. It is essentially a working dog—bred to be hardy and reliable, able to stand up to the harshest conditions and the toughest sheep. The working Bearded Collie has become less common in the last few decades and risked dying out.

Herding instincts and tractability can be assessed in noncompetitive herding tests. Bearded Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

==Health==

The size of an average litter is seven pups.

===Mortality===
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.9 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Leading causes of death amongst Bearded Collies in a 2004 Kennel Club survey were old age (26%), cancer (19%), cerebrovascular disease (9%), and chronic kidney failure (8%).

===Morbidity===
Further existing breed dispositions of the Bearded Collie include: Dermatological conditions, such as pemphigus foliaceous and black skin disease, follicular dysplasia, musculoskeletal conditions such as congenital elbow luxation, ocular conditions, such as corneal dystrophy, cataract and generalized progressive retinal atrophy (GPRA).

===Hypoadrenocorticism===

Hypoadrenocorticism (also known as Addison&#x27;s disease) is an inherited disease in Bearded Collies, although the mechanism of inheritance is not known. It occurs when the adrenal cortex produces insufficient glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid hormones. It affects approximately 2–3.4% of Bearded Collies in the USA/Canada, and causes the death of at least 1% of Bearded Collies in the UK. These are much higher percentages than for the general dog population (0.1%), and hypoadrenocorticism causes a disproportionate number of deaths among young dogs.

==In popular culture==
*The role of Nana in the original production of the James Barrie play &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was performed by a Bearded Collie.
*A Bearded Collie named Coal featured in the 2006 film &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; starring Tim Allen. This film involves Dave who turns into one after getting bitten by a sacred dog.
*Ralphie, a Bearded Collie, appears in the 2009 film &quot;Hotel for Dogs&quot;.

<text>Sandray () is one of the Barra Isles in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It never had a large population, and has been uninhabited since 1934. It is now known for its large seabird colony.

==Geography==
Sandray is half a mile due south of Vatersay, and east of Flodaigh, north east of Lingeigh and Pabaigh. Maol Domhnaigh/Muldoanich is to the north east of it. There are three main peninsulas on the south end of Sandray, they are called Meanish, Leehinish and Rubha Pabbach.

<text>The Martin AM Mauler (originally XBTM) is a single-seat carrier-based attack aircraft built for the United States Navy. Designed during World War II, the Mauler encountered development delays and did not enter service until 1948 in small numbers. The aircraft proved troublesome and remained in frontline service only until 1950, when the Navy switched to the smaller and simpler Douglas AD Skyraider. Maulers remained in reserve squadrons until 1953. A few were built as AM-1Q electronic-warfare aircraft with an additional crewman in the fuselage.

==Design and development==
In the 1930s and early 1940s, the Navy divided carrier-borne bombers into two types: the torpedo bomber and the dive bomber, each with crews of two or three men. Wartime experience showed that pilots could aim bombs and torpedoes without assistance from other crewmembers as well as navigate with the aid of radio beacons, and the development of more powerful engines meant that faster aircraft no longer needed a rear gunner for self-defense. Furthermore, the consolidation of the two types of bombers greatly increased the flexibility of a carrier&#x27;s air group and allowed the number of fighters in an air group to be increased.

In 1943, the US Navy invited proposals for a new multi-purpose bomber and selected four designs in September: the Curtiss XBTC, Douglas XBT2D Skyraider, Kaiser-Fleetwings BTK and the Martin XBTM. Martin was tasked to provide a backup to the Curtiss design which had been selected as a replacement to the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver. Due to the US Navy&#x27;s concern that the Curtiss design was overly complex and that the company&#x27;s record was particularly poor during the Helldiver&#x27;s development, Martin was instructed to create an &quot;unexperimental&quot; design that would be a reliable platform for the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major radial engine that powered both aircraft. Two prototypes were ordered from Martin on 31 May 1944 with the internal designation of Model 210.
The XBTM-1 was a low-wing, all-metal monoplane with folding wings to allow more compact storage in carrier hangar decks, and conventional landing gear. Its fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque with the single-seat cockpit and its teardrop-shaped canopy positioned just aft of the air-cooled engine. Just behind the cockpit was a fuel tank. The large wing consisted of a two-spar center section with hydraulically folded three-spar outer panels. A large dive brake was positioned on the trailing edge of the wing. When closed it could be lowered for use as a landing flap or it could be split into alternating upper and lower sections, with intermeshing &quot;fingers&quot; for use in its intended role. It was very effective in this role, mainly due to its great surface area, but this was at the cost of the width of the ailerons, which significantly reduced their efficiency. A pair of fuel tanks were positioned in the roots of the center section. All fuel tanks were self sealing and the pilot and oil cooler were protected by of armor.
The fixed armament of four T-31 autocannon was fitted in the center section, adjacent to the outer wing panels with 200 rounds per gun. A centerline hardpoint and a pair of outer hardpoints were installed on the center section and rated to take bombs, fuel tanks or torpedoes up to in weight. The outer hardpoints could also carry an AN/APS-4 search radar in a pod. A dozen hardpoints could be installed on the outer wing panels to carry bombs or High Velocity Aircraft Rockets. In service, the Mauler earned the nickname &quot;Able Mable&quot; because its &quot;AM&quot; designation and the fact that in the phonetic alphabet of the era the letter &quot;A&quot; was pronounced as &quot;Able&quot;, the name &quot;Mabel&quot; being a rhyme and representing the M, and perhaps of its remarkable load-carrying ability, once lifting of ordnance (three torpedoes, a dozen 250-pound bombs plus its 20 mm guns and their ammunition) on 30 March 1949, perhaps the heaviest load ever carried by a single-engine, piston-powered aircraft.

The first XBTM-1 made its maiden flight on 26 August 1944 and began flight testing after it reached the Naval Air Test Center on 11 December. The Navy ordered 750 more aircraft on 15 January 1945, although this was reduced to 99 aircraft after the surrender of Japan in August. The second prototype made its first flight on 20 May. Initial flight tests conducted with the first two prototypes revealed significant problems with the engine, its cowling, the vertical stabilizer and rudder. In response, the cowling was lengthened and the engine mount was canted two degrees to the right to offset the engine&#x27;s tremendous torque. The length of the carburetor airscoop was extended and the propeller spinner, rudder, and the vertical stabilizer were redesigned. In April 1946 the aircraft designation was changed to AM-1 when the Navy replaced its Bomber-Torpedo classification with Attack, well before the redesign was completed in early 1947.

First deliveries began in March 1947 and a flight test program began that month that lasted three years before the major deficiencies identified were fully corrected. Carrier landing trials revealed a structural weakness of the rear fuselage when one aircraft was broken in half during a heavy landing. Severe vibrations in the tail upon engaging the arresting wire were cured by adding a roller bearing to the tailhook to counter the sideways forces placed on the tailhook. Other necessary changes were the addition of spoiler ailerons and an elevator control boost to improve the aircraft&#x27;s poor controllability at low speeds. In addition, the cockpit layout was unsatisfactory and had to be redesigned. The NATC finally deemed the Mauler acceptable for carrier landings in August 1948 even though aircraft had been issued to one squadron earlier in the year and a new batch of 50 aircraft had been ordered in May. Despite all the modifications to the aircraft over its short life, it remained a maintenance nightmare, especially the leaky hydraulic systems.
The AM-1Q was developed for electronic countermeasures duties. The fuselage fuel tank was removed to make room for the electronics operator and his equipment in a windowless compartment. The aircraft carried several radio and radar receivers, transmitters and a signal analyzer. The operator could also drop bundles of chaff through a chute to block radar signals.

Pilots found the Mauler a heavy-handling aircraft which was difficult to fly in formation and hard to land aboard a carrier because a less-than-perfect landing often caused the aircraft to bounce over the arresting wires and into the safety barrier. It was a very stable dive bomber, more so than the Skyraider, and could carry more ordnance. Maintenance problems and the difficulty of landing aboard a carrier caused some pilots to give it the nickname of &quot;Awful Monster&quot;.

==Operational history==

With the prospect of flying the AD-1 Skyraider and AM-1 in carrier operations, the US Navy assigned the Maulers to Atlantic Fleet squadrons. Attack Squadron 17A (VA-17A) was the first unit to get the AM-1 and received its 18 aircraft in March and April 1948. It was redesignated VA-174 on 11 August and began carrier qualification trials aboard on 27–28 December and completed them aboard in January 1949 with all assigned pilots completing their day qualifications. During this latter deployment, the squadron participated in the unsuccessful search for a British South American Airways Avro Tudor airliner missing in the Caribbean. The squadron made a brief deployment aboard , one of the largest carriers in the US Navy, in early 1949. The longer flight deck of the carriers made landings easier for the AM-1 pilots and the squadron did not have a single landing accident during its deployment. Upon its return, the unit transferred its aircraft to VA-44 and VA-45, both newly assigned to &quot;Midway&quot;, and converted to the Skyraider before being disbanded in January 1950.

The two squadrons began receiving their aircraft in March 1949 and conducted their carrier qualifications from 2 to 7 May. VA-45 became the only Mauler squadron to complete qualifications without any accidents. They made a short deployment aboard the carrier from 1 to 9 September and began converting back to Skyraiders the following month.

Carrier Air Group 8 (CVG-8) was established on 15 September 1948 in response to the Berlin Blockade with newly qualified pilots and reservists who volunteered for active duty. VA-84 and VA-85, the air group&#x27;s attack squadrons, began receiving Maulers in November and the last aircraft was delivered in January 1949. Later that month the air group made a flyover of President Harry Truman&#x27;s Inauguration ceremony. The squadron conducted their qualifications aboard &quot;Midway&quot; from 3 to 6 May with ten Maulers crashing into the safety barrier between them. CVG-8 made a two-week cruise aboard &quot;Midway&quot; beginning on 27 June along the East Coast of the United States, before it was disbanded in November after the peaceful resolution of the Berlin Blockade.
Many of the AM-1Q electronic-warfare variants were assigned to Composite Squadron 4 (VC-4), based at NAS Atlantic City, and were detached in small groups for each Atlantic Fleet carrier deployment. Little is known about their service and the squadron is last known to have had Maulers assigned on 1 October 1950.

Although the Skyraider was a third smaller and carried a third less bombload, it proved more reliable in service and easier to fly and land, and Navy pilots preferred it. In 1950 the decision was made to use the Mauler only from shore-based units and later that year all but Naval Reserve units abandoned the type. The aircraft operated with reserve squadrons until 1953.

<text>The Imperial Order of the Crown of India is an order in the British honours system. The Order was established by Queen Victoria when she became Empress of India in 1878. The Order was open only to women, and no appointments have been made since the Partition of India in 1947. The Order was limited to British princesses, wives or female relatives of Indian princes (female rulers like the Nawab Begums of Bhopal counted as such) and the wife or female relatives of any person who held the office of:
*Viceroy of India
*Governor of Madras
*Governor of Bombay
*Governor of Bengal
*Commander-in-Chief India
*Secretary of State for India
*Governor-General of India

==History==
The Order of the Crown of India was established by Queen Victoria in 1878 as a companion order to the Order of Victoria and Albert. The order was intended to recognize women associated with India regardless of their social statuses. In practice, the Order of the Crown of India was mostly conferred on royalty, wives of peers, wives of members of India&#x27;s ruling classes and wives of civil servants stationed in India. It is one of the few honors which was reserved for women only, such as the Royal Red Cross, Order of Victoria and Albert and the Royal Family Order.

Queen Elizabeth II, then Princess Elizabeth, and her sister, Princess Margaret, were appointed to the Order by their father, King George VI, in June 1947, before the British Raj was dissolved three months later, making them among the last women to be presented with the Order. By the late 20th century there were only four living recipients – Queen Elizabeth II, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret, and Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, who was the last ordinary member at the time of her death in 2004. 

With the death of the last surviving holder, Queen Elizabeth II, the last active imperial Indian order became dormant in 2022.

==Description==

The members of the Order could use the post-nominal letters &quot;CI&quot;, but did not acquire any special precedence or status due to it. Furthermore, they were entitled to wear the badge of the Order, which included Queen Victoria&#x27;s Imperial Cypher, VRI (&quot;Victoria Regina Imperatrix&quot;). The letters were set in diamonds, pearls, and turquoises, and were together surrounded by a border of pearls surmounted by a figure of the Imperial Crown. The badge was worn and attached to a light blue bow, edged in white, on the left shoulder.

<text>Pabbay () is one of the Barra Isles at the southern tip of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The name comes from &quot;Papey&quot;, which is Norse for &quot;island of the &quot;papar&quot;&quot; (i.e. monks). At only , it never had a large population, and, after all the able-bodied men were killed in a fierce storm while out on a fishing trip on 1 May 1897, it was abandoned in the early twentieth century.

The National Trust for Scotland has owned the island since 2000. With only two sheep left on the island in July 2007 and few, if any, other permanent mammalian residents, Pabbay is consequently home in summer to many ground-nesting birds due to the absence of predators.

The island was the site of a Celtic hermitage, and a Pictish carved stone dates from that period. Remains of an Iron Age settlement can also been seen on Pabbay.

The name of Pabbay is used for one of the three houses of Castlebay Secondary School. The other two are Mingulay and Sandray.

==Areas of Interest==

Bàgh Bàn is the name applied to a large bay situated on the SE coast of the island. It&#x27;s the principal bay on the coast of the island and is well sheltered from the North and West - this made it the ideal area for historical settlers.

Rosinish (or Rubha Phabach) is a small peninsular headland situated on the East coast of the island. It lies in a South-Easterly direction and is only attached to the mainland of the island by a small natural arch.

Steir is the narrow rock which joins Rosinish to the mainland.

==Rock Climbing==
Composed of Lewisian gneiss, Pabbay is &quot;one of the finest climbing venues in the UK&quot;.
This includes the climbing route The Great Arch, which is graded E8 6c.

<doc id="547154" wikidata="Q423930" url="?curid=547154" title="Hydrochlorothiazide">
<text>Hydrochlorothiazide, sold under the brand name Hydrodiuril among others, is a diuretic medication used to treat hypertension and swelling due to fluid build-up. Other uses include treating diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis and to decrease the risk of kidney stones in those with a high calcium level in the urine. Hydrochlorothiazide is taken by mouth and may be combined with other blood pressure medications as a single pill to increase effectiveness. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide medication which inhibits reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions from the distal convoluted tubules of the kidneys, causing a natriuresis. This initially increases urine volume and lowers blood volume. It is believed to reduce peripheral vascular resistance.
Potential side effects include poor kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, including low blood potassium, and, less commonly, low blood sodium, gout, high blood sugar, and feeling lightheaded with standing.
Two companies, Merck &amp; Co. and Ciba Specialty Chemicals, state they discovered the medication which became commercially available in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic drug and is relatively affordable. In 2022, it was the twelfth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 38million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Hydrochlorothiazide is used for the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, symptomatic edema, diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis. It is also used for the prevention of kidney stones in those who have high levels of calcium in their urine.

Multiple studies suggest hydrochlorothiazide could be used as initial monotherapy in people with primary hypertension; however, the decision should be weighed against the consequence of long-term adverse metabolic abnormalities. Doses of hydrochlorothiazide of 50 mg or less over four years reduced mortality and development of cardiovascular diseases better than high-dose hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg or more) and beta-blockers. A 2019 review supported equivalence between drug classes for initiating monotherapy in hypertension, although thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics showed better primary effectiveness and safety profiles than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.

Low doses (50 mg or less) of hydrochlorothiazide as first‐line therapy for hypertension were found to reduce total mortality and cardiovascular disease events over a four-year study. Hydrochlorothiazide appears be more effective than chlorthalidone in preventing heart attacks and strokes. Hydrochlorothiazide is less potent but may be more effective than chlorthalidone in reducing blood pressure. More robust studies are required to confirm which drug is superior in reducing cardiovascular events. Side effect profile for both drugs appear similar and are dose dependent.

Hydrochlorothiazide is also sometimes used to prevent osteopenia and treat hypoparathyroidism, hypercalciuria, Dent&#x27;s disease, and Ménière&#x27;s disease.

A low level of evidence, predominantly from observational studies, suggests that thiazide diuretics have a modest beneficial effect on bone mineral density and are associated with a decreased fracture risk when compared with people not taking thiazides. Thiazides decrease mineral bone loss by promoting calcium retention in the kidney, and by directly stimulating osteoblast differentiation and bone mineral formation.

The combination of fixed-dose preparation such as losartan/hydrochlorothiazide has added advantages of a more potent antihypertensive effect with additional antihypertensive efficacy at the dose of 100 mg/25 mg when compared to monotherapy.

==Adverse effects==
* Hypokalemia, or low blood levels of potassium are an occasional side effect. It can be usually prevented by potassium supplements or by combining hydrochlorothiazide with a potassium-sparing diuretic
* Other disturbances in the levels of serum electrolytes, including hypomagnesemia (low magnesium), hyponatremia (low sodium), and hypercalcemia (high calcium)
* Hyperuricemia (high levels of uric acid in the blood). All thiazide diuretics including hydrochlorothiazide can inhibit excretion of uric acid by the kidneys, thereby increasing serum concentrations of uric acid. This may increase the incidence of gout in doses of ≥ 25 mg per day and in more susceptible patients such as male gender of &lt;60 years old.
* Hyperglycemia, high blood sugar
* Hyperlipidemia, high cholesterol and triglycerides
* Headache
* Nausea/vomiting
* Photosensitivity
* Weight gain
* Pancreatitis

Package inserts contain vague and inconsistent data surrounding the use of thiazide diuretics in patients with allergies to sulfa drugs, with little evidence to support these statements. A retrospective cohort study conducted by Strom et al. concluded that there is an increased risk of an allergic reaction occurring in patients with a predisposition to allergic reactions in general rather than cross reactivity from structural components of the sulfonamide-based drug. Prescribers should examine the evidence carefully and assess each patient individually, paying particular attention to their prior history of sulfonamide hypersensitivity rather than relying on drug monograph information.

There is an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In August 2020, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration required the Product Information (PI) and Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) for medicines containing hydrochlorothiazide to be updated to include details about an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In August 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated the drug label about an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer (basal cell skin cancer or squamous cell skin cancer).

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
Hydrochlorothiazide is available as a generic drug under a large number of brand names, including Apo-Hydro, Aquazide, BPZide, Dichlotride, Esidrex, Hydrochlorot, Hydrodiuril, HydroSaluric, Hypothiazid, Microzide, Oretic and many others.

To reduce pill burden and in order to reduce side effects, hydrochlorothiazide is often used in fixed-dose combinations with many other classes of antihypertensive drugs such as:
* ACE inhibitors – e.g. Prinzide or Zestoretic (with lisinopril), Co-Renitec (with enalapril), Capozide (with captopril), Accuretic (with quinapril), Monopril HCT (with fosinopril), Lotensin HCT (with benazepril), etc.
* Angiotensin receptor blockers – e.g. Hyzaar (with losartan), Co-Diovan or Diovan HCT (with valsartan), Teveten Plus (with eprosartan), Avalide or CoAprovel (with irbesartan), Atacand HCT or Atacand Plus (with candesartan), etc.
* Beta blockers – e.g. Ziac or Lodoz (with bisoprolol), Nebilet Plus or Nebilet HCT (with nebivolol), Dutoprol or Lopressor HCT (with metoprolol), etc.
* Direct renin inhibitors – e.g. Co-Rasilez or Tekturna HCT (with aliskiren)
* Potassium sparing diuretics – Dyazide and Maxzide triamterene

===Sport===
Use of hydrochlorothiazide is prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency for its ability to mask the use of performance-enhancing drugs.

<doc id="547172" wikidata="Q379874" url="?curid=547172" title="Thirty-second note">
<text>In music, a thirty-second note (American) or demisemiquaver (British) is a note played for of the duration of a whole note (or &quot;semibreve&quot;). It lasts half as long as a sixteenth note (or &quot;semiquaver&quot;) and twice as long as a sixty-fourth (or &quot;hemidemisemiquaver&quot;).

Thirty-second notes are notated with an oval, filled-in note head and a straight note stem with three flags or beams. A single thirty-second note is always stemmed with flags, while two or more are usually beamed in groups.
As with all notes with stems, thirty-second notes are drawn with stems to the right of the notehead, extending up, when they are below the middle line of the musical staff. When they are on or above the middle line, they are drawn with stems on the left of the note head, extending down. Flags are always on the right side of the stem, and curve to the right. On stems extending up, the flags start at the top and curve down; for downward extending stems, the flags start at the bottom of the stem and curve up. When multiple thirty-second notes or eighth notes (or sixteenths, etc.) are next to each other, the flags may be connected with a beam. Similar rules apply to smaller divisions such as sixty-fourth notes.

A related symbol is the thirty-second rest or demisemiquaver rest (shown to the right), which denotes a silence for the same duration as a thirty-second note.

<doc id="547176" wikidata="Q16167313" url="?curid=547176" title="Shogun Warriors (toys)">
<text>Shogun Warriors was a line of toys released by Mattel Inc. in North America from 1977 to 1980. The line consisted of several imported toys based on Japanese anime mecha.

==Overview==

The line was drawn from toys originally produced by Japanese company Popy, based on several anime and tokusatsu shows featuring giant robots. They were originally manufactured in three sizes: plastic versions, die-cast metal versions, and slightly taller but much more detailed 5-inch (127 mm) die-cast versions. Many of the robot’s original names were altered, such as Getter Dragon (Dragun) and Great Mazinger (Great Mazinga). Several vehicles were also offered, as well as a set that could be put together to form the super robot Combattler V (here renamed Combattra). Later on in the line, Mattel introduced toys of Godzilla and Rodan.

The toys featured spring-loaded launcher weapons such as missiles, shuriken and battle axes. Some were able to launch their fists, while the later die-cast versions also had the ability to transform into different shapes. Raideen (here renamed Raydeen), for example, could become a birdlike spaceship. These &quot;convertible&quot; versions were in a sense the precursors to the &quot;Transformers&quot; line of toy robots. Toward the end of production, Mattel proposed the inclusion of plastic toy vehicles for the 3.5&quot; figures to ride in exclusively in the United States, but these toys were never released for purchase.

Similar to other toy lines during the 1970s, the &quot;Shogun Warriors&quot; toys came under pressure over safety concerns regarding their spring-loaded weapons. The concern was that children might launch the weapons and hit other children or pets in the eyes. There was also a risk that small children might choke on the small plastic missiles and other parts. Toy manufacturers then faced new regulations as a result of reported injuries received while playing with these toys. Consequently, many toy companies were forced to remodel existing toy lines with child-safe variations such as spring-loaded &quot;action&quot; missiles that would remain attached to the toy. Missiles were also reshaped to have a flat head instead of a pointed one. Because of this, as well as declining sales, the &quot;Shogun Warrior&quot; toy line was discontinued by 1980.

==Tie-in media==
===Comic===

In order to promote the toys, Mattel approached Marvel Comics to produce a comic tie-in for the range, having enjoyed a fruitful relationship with the company on &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters&quot;. Only three figures would be featured in the comic - Raydeen (originally from &quot;Brave Raideen&quot;); Dangard Ace (from &quot;Wakusei Robo Danguard Ace&quot;) and Combatra (from &quot;Chōdenji Robo Combattler V&quot;). Series artist Herb Trimpe would also produce some artwork used by Mattel on toy advertisements.

===Cartoon===
Due to &quot;Shogun Warriors&quot; being based on characters drawn from a wide number of Japanese TV shows, there was no cartoon produced. However, several of the characters featured in the toy line featured in Jim Terry&#x27;s &quot;Force Five&quot; series.

==Toy line==
===Jumbo Machinders===
Jumbo Machinders were tall vinyl figures.

===Die-Cast Action Figures===
 figures.

===Two-In-Ones===
 figures that could be reconfigured between two modes.

===Collector&#x27;s===
 figures.

===Action Vehicles===
Vehicles with action features.

===U-Combine Combatra Vehicles===
Five vehicles that could be combined to form the super-robot Combattra. Sold both separately and as a boxed set.

==In popular culture==
Several Shogun Warriors appeared in the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; episode &quot;The Deadly Toys&quot; at a toy shop run by Frank Gorshin&#x27;s character.

Mazinger and Raideen (called Mazinga and Raydeen) appeared in the &quot;MAD&quot; sketch &quot;Regular Shogun Warriors&quot;, a parody of the toyline and &quot;Regular Show&quot;.

==Revival==
In 2010, Toynami revived the &quot;Shogun Warriors&quot; name with a new toy line, consisting of Jumbo Machinder toys. The first two robots in this line were GoLion and Dairugger XV, both of which were adapted in the Western world as &quot;Voltron&quot;. Subsequent entries in the line would include characters not from anime mecha, such as Bender and a stormtrooper.

<doc id="547178" wikidata="Q8030864" url="?curid=547178" title="Women's College World Series">
<text>The Women&#x27;s College World Series (WCWS) is the final portion of the NCAA Division I softball tournament for college softball in the United States. The eight teams of the WCWS play a double-elimination tournament until just two teams remain. These two teams compete in a best-of-three series to determine the Division I WCWS National Champion. Previous WCWS losses do not factor into the best-of-three championship series, and the first team to win two of three games is declared the National Champion.

Like the Men&#x27;s College World Series in baseball, the WCWS initially divides the eight teams ranked one (the top seed) thru eight and are then divided into two brackets of four teams. The teams play their first-round match up as follows: 1 v 8, 2 v 7, 3 v 6 and 4 v 5. Unique to the WCWS is that the loser of the first-round game on one side of the bracket crosses over to the loser&#x27;s bracket on the other side. Suffering a second loss eliminates said team from the WCWS. 
Round number two will feature the four winners of round-one games against each other, with the highest remaining seed vs the lowest remaining undefeated seed. In the losers bracket, the four first round losers face each other, with the two winners advancing while the losers who suffer their second loss are eliminated from tourney play. Round three features the two losing teams from round two (winners bracket) vs round two-winners (from losers bracket) while the remaining two undefeated teams get a day of rest. Once round three is complete, there will now be four teams eliminated. The remaining four teams will then play each other in round four, with one team with one loss playing one team with no losses. If a team with a loss loses again, they are eliminated. If teams with no losses suffer a (first) loss, the remaining teams will then be realigned and forced to play one last time, with the winners advancing to the best-of-three championship series. If by chance one or both unbeaten teams win in round four, then that team (or both teams) advances to the best-of-three championship series. From there games are cut to one game per day over the next three days (weather pending). This feature allows any two of the eight WCWS teams to potentially comprise the final two, unlike the MCWS, whose two halves remain separate until the championship series.

The WCWS takes place at Devon Park in Oklahoma City. From 1969 to 1981, the women&#x27;s collegiate softball championship was also known as the Women&#x27;s College World Series and was promoted as such. During 1969–1979, the series was played in Omaha, after which the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) held the series in 1980–1982 in Norman, Oklahoma. There were two competing World Series tournaments in 1982. The NCAA held its first six Division I tournaments in Omaha in 1982–1987, followed by Sunnyvale, California, in 1988–1989. The event has been held in Oklahoma City every year since then, except for 1996, when it was held at the softball venue for the &#x27;96 Olympic Games in Columbus, Georgia.

Softball was one of twelve women&#x27;s sports added to the NCAA championship program for the 1981–82 school year, as the NCAA engaged in battle with the AIAW for sole governance of women&#x27;s collegiate sports. The AIAW continued to conduct its established championship program in the same twelve (and other) sports. The 1982 softball championship tournaments of both the AIAW and the NCAA were called &quot;Women&#x27;s College World Series&quot;. However, after a year of dual women&#x27;s championships, the NCAA won out over the AIAW.

==Division I==

===NCAA===

* Nebraska&#x27;s runner-up finish in 1985 was vacated by the NCAA.

** The 1995 title by UCLA and any related records have been vacated by the NCAA due to scholarship violations. Criticism also centered on UCLA player Tanya Harding who was recruited from Queensland, Australia, midway through the 1995 season. After UCLA captured the NCAA National Championship, Harding, the MVP of the tournament, returned to her homeland without taking final exams or earning a single college credit. Despite not violating any formal rules in recruiting Harding, the incident generated heated criticism that some foreign athletes were little more than hired guns.

*** Beginning in 2005, a best-of-three series determines the national championship.

===AIAW===
From 1969 to 1972, the DGWS (forerunner organization of the AIAW) recognized the WCWS, organized by the Amateur Softball Association, as the collegiate championship tournament. The AIAW assumed responsibilities from DGWS in 1973.

===NCAA team titles by school===
*UCLA also won the 1995 title, but it has since been vacated by the NCAA; see above.

===AIAW team titles by school===
From 1969 to 1972, the DGWS (forerunner organization of the AIAW) recognized the WCWS, organized by the Amateur Softball Association, as the collegiate championship tournament. The AIAW assumed responsibilities from DGWS in 1973.

<doc id="547184" wikidata="Q639975" url="?curid=547184" title="United Center">
<text>The United Center is an indoor arena on the Near West Side of Chicago, Illinois. It is home to the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). It is named for its corporate sponsor United Airlines. With a capacity of nearly 21,000, the United Center is the largest arena by capacity in the NBA, and second largest arena by capacity in the NHL. It also has a seating capacity of 23,500 for concerts.

Opened in 1994, the United Center replaced the West Side&#x27;s Chicago Stadium, which was opened in 1929 and located across the street from the center. It is owned by the Reinsdorf and Wirtz families, owners of the teams that use the arena, and which also own much of the surrounding land. The first event held at the arena was WWF SummerSlam, and it hosts hundreds of sporting events, and concerts a year. The center has also hosted the 1996, and the 2024 Democratic National Convention. The arena served as the municipal emergency hub in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The arena is home to a statue of basketball great Michael Jordan, posed mid-air in his iconic &quot;flying&quot; jump, erected in 1994. Originally outside, it now stands inside an atrium extension and event space which was added to the Center in 2017. The Jordan statue has since been joined by statues of Blackhawks ice hockey players Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita, while a statue of various Blackhawks players is located across the street on the site of Chicago Stadium.

== United Center history ==
Both the Chicago Blackhawks and the Chicago Bulls play their home games at the arena with some of them on back-to-back nights. In the 2023-2024 edition of the NBA, the Bulls drew an average attendance of 20,624 in 41 home games, the highest in the NBA. The hardwood floor for the Bulls games is laid over the ice that the Blackhawks play on. The flooring is assembled like a puzzle and taken apart when the Blackhawks have a game.

The Bulls and Blackhawks own and operate the United Center through the United Center Joint Venture (UCJV), a 50/50 partnership. It covers on a 46-acre (19 ha) parcel, west of the Chicago Loop. The arena is the largest in the United States in size, though not in capacity. Its exterior bears a striking resemblance to that of Chicago Stadium. It seats 19,717 for hockey, 20,917 for basketball and up to 23,500 for concerts. The United Center hosts over 200 events per year and has drawn over 20 million visitors since its opening. Attendance routinely exceeds seating capacity for Bulls and Blackhawks games.

The Bulls opened their practice facility, The Advocate Center, located a block east of the United Center, in 2014. Advocate Health Care owns the naming rights to the facility.

The Blackhawks opened their practice facility, Fifth Third Arena (formerly MB Ice Arena prior to 2019), located two blocks to the south of the United Center, in 2017.

=== Design and construction ===
The original construction of the arena cost $175 million.

The United Center&#x27;s acoustics were designed to amplify noise to replicate &quot;The Roar&quot; – the din that made Chicago Stadium famous, especially during hockey games. The designers originally estimated that the United Center would be 80% as loud as the Chicago Stadium had been. To amplify noise, they placed angled steel panels around the top level in order to reflect noise back into the arena&#x27;s bowl.

During hockey season, the Blackhawks use an Allen TH323 Theatre Organ that is a replica of the Chicago Stadium&#x27;s famous Barton organ. Recreating the old organ&#x27;s notes took two years.

The building is tall, and is of concrete and steel construction, with 3,500 tons of steel being utilized in its construction. While the Blackhawks and Bulls had long planned another arena, an inflated real estate market and the early 1990s recession delayed the project until financing was secured from an international syndicate, with funding by banks from Japan, Australia and France. The arena originally had 216 luxury sky-boxes, the most of any professional hockey or basketball venue at the time of its opening. But after the 2009–10 renovation, this had been decreased to 169 executive suites spread across its three levels of suites. It also was originally constructed with 3,000 club seats.

Architects originally proposed utilizing limestone and granite for its exterior, however the owners instead decided to have a less expensive precast concrete exterior.

Per the team owners&#x27; request, the City of Chicago closed a section of Monroe Street west of the stadium, as the venue&#x27;s footprint extends into where the road&#x27;s sidewalk had previously been located. When the venue opened, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; architecture critic Blair Kamin criticized this street closure and other aspects as the venue&#x27;s design as isolating the venue from its surrounding neighborhood. He argued that the venue&#x27;s design had intentionally closed the arena off from its surroundings, which at the time included the (since-demolished) Henry Horner Homes public housing.

=== Renovations ===
==== Late 2000s club additions and 300 level renovation ====
In 2008, the United Center saw the debut of the Harris Club, private premium seating area that filled space previous occupied by several club-level suites. The Harris Club was an open lounge premium seating area with a capacity of 236 ticketholders fitted with amenities such including a Nintendo Wii, a pool table, three bars, a buffet, and multiple televisions. Another change was the addition of two bars on the 300 level with open views to the arena bowl.

In time for the 2009–10 season of its sports tenants, the United Center&#x27;s 300 level saw its concourse renovated with the addition of 144 flat screen televisions, new food and beverage stations above select seating sections and two new bars that open up to panoramic views of the arena. During the 2010 off-season, two additional bars with panoramic views of the arena were added along with the other two that had been added the previous year. Another notable addition were illuminated signs on each side of the arena&#x27;s 300 level seating bowl reading &quot;Welcome to the Madhouse&quot;. The United Center also renovated several of its club-level suites into 32 &quot;theater boxes&quot;, which were opera-style boxes seating four-people seating areas with access to an upscale restaurant-style lounge area shared with the other theater boxes. The theater boxes were built on the opposite end of the seating bowl as the Harris Club.

==== 2010s changes ====
After the 2012–13 season, a third panoramic LED bar was installed around the 300 level, which required the removal of the &quot;Welcome to the Madhouse&quot; signs.

A new court floor design was added for the Bulls&#x27; 2015–16 season and includes multiple changes. The iconic bull head logo at center court has increased in size by 75% and the image of a basketball that was previously behind the logo has been removed. The &quot;CHICAGO BULLS&quot; text on the endlines has been changed to the font used in the official Bulls logo to make the court design more consistent with the Bulls brand, and the same font has been applied to the &quot;Bulls.com&quot; and the &quot;@ChicagoBulls&quot; text on the north apron of the court. The lines on the court have been changed from red and white to all black to emphasize the bold colors of the Bulls brand. The four stars from the City of Chicago flag have been added to the south apron of the court to highlight the team&#x27;s civic pride and incorporate the &quot;Chicago Basketball&quot; branding campaign. As of the 2024-2025 Bulls season, the current court features sponsor FanDuel in on the endlines with a smaller text of &quot;CHICAGO BULLS&quot;, and Calamos replacing &quot;Bulls.com&quot; and the &quot;@ChicagoBulls&quot; text on the north apron of the court.


In March 2017, the United Center opened a new 190,000 square foot privately funded &quot;atrium&quot; addition. The addition featured office space on its second, third, and fourth floors and a gathering place on its first floor which is open to fans and visitors before, during, and after events. The statue of Michael Jordan which formerly sat outside the arena was relocated to the atrium.

In 2019, a new scoreboard manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric was added to the United Center. At its unveiling, the scoreboard was the largest and highest-resolution scoreboard in any dual-purpose NHL/NBA arena. The scoreboard has a display with 4 mm pixel spacing, six independent moving panels, and a continuous inner ring display. New audio and lighting systems were installed alongside the scoreboard upgrade.

==== Sportsbook Lounge ====
On February 1, 2022, the United Center and FanDuel Group announced a partnership to develop a sportsbook lounge located off the United Center atrium. The two-story venue was built out as a non-wagering space complete with FanDuel branding with screens featuring other live sports events. With the lounge opened in 2023, betting is still contingent on approval from the Illinois Gaming Board.

==== Neighborhood development 1901 Project ====
The Reinsdorf and Wirtz families who own the United Center and much of the surrounding land have considered development schemes for the area. In 2024, they announced plans for a potential $7 billion &quot;mega-development.&quot; Named the &quot;1901 Project&quot; for the United Center&#x27;s address number on West Madison Street, the plan includes almost 9,500 new housing units and related neighborhood amenities and business spaces. Like most mega-developments, the project would be phased and could take many years to realize. The first phase includes an auditorium planned as a music venue.

In 2025 it was announced that a new CTA Pink Line station is being explored to be built as part of the Project 1901 development. It would be located directly east of the United Center and rebuild the former Madison station that was demolished in 1951.

== Statues ==
Several statues of Bulls and Blackhawks greats exist inside and around the outside of the arena.

The most well-known of these is the statue of Michael Jordan, also known as &quot;The Spirit&quot;, on the east side of the arena in an atrium (opened in 2017) outside Gate Four. Originally installed in 1994, during Jordan&#x27;s first retirement and just after the arena&#x27;s opening, the statue features Jordan mid-dunk over an opposing player, with his tenures with the Bulls and career stats engraved on the bottom. The statue was initially located directly in front of the arena.

In 2000, in honor of the team&#x27;s 75th anniversary, a statue of various Blackhawks greats from different eras, along with the franchise&#x27;s Indian head logo, was erected on the north side of the stadium across Madison Street, near the former Chicago Stadium site. The back of the statue features the names of all Blackhawks players up to that point, along with a marble plaque commemorating Chicago Stadium. In October 2020, the statue was vandalized in protest of the team&#x27;s use of Native American iconography as a logo and was temporarily removed for repairs.

Blackhawks legends Bobby Hull and Stan Mikita received bronze statues in their honor outside of the United Center during the 2011–12 NHL season.

In 2011, a bronze bust of Bulls great Scottie Pippen was dedicated in the stadium&#x27;s first-floor concourse.

== Sponsorship ==


United Airlines paid about $1.8 million per year in 2014 for its naming rights.

In May 2010, United announced they would be merging with Continental Airlines resulting in the United name being kept but with Continental&#x27;s globe logo and corporate look being retained, eliminating the tulip emblem. This rebranding would be completed in October 2010, just before the 2010–11 NBA and NHL seasons started. Despite this change, the arena continued to use United&#x27;s previous tulip logo for the 2010–11 season and in the 2011 NHL and NBA playoffs. In the summer of 2011, all the previous United tulip signs were at last replaced with the globe logo to reflect the new identity of the combined airline in time for the 2011–12 NHL and NBA seasons and onwards, nearly a year after the merger and identity change had initially gone into effect by United themselves. Two new lit signs on the east and west ends of the arena saying &quot;United Center&quot; with the United globe in the middle were also revealed below the upper-level suites complementing the former &quot;Madhouse&quot; signs on the north and south sides.

In December 2013, it was announced that an agreement had been reached to keep United&#x27;s naming rights for the arena for another 20 years. The United Center will see a series of updates and upgrades to the interior and exterior of the building. New signage, additional LED boards, and other elements have been added after reaching this agreement. LED screens have been installed on the north side of the arena along with a panoramic LED board on the 300 level, eliminating the &quot;Welcome To The Madhouse&quot; sign.

Anheuser-Busch has also established a sponsorship. They are partners with both the Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks and have gained rights to signage inside the arena along with a pub.

PepsiCo and the United Center announced on July 12, 2023, a multi-year partnership to become the official soft drink of the United Center, Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks, replacing Coca-Cola.

<text>George Driver &quot;Pinky&quot; Nelson (born July 13, 1950) is an American physicist, astronomer, science educator, and retired NASA astronaut.

==Early life and education==
Nelson was born on July 13, 1950, in Charles City, Iowa, but considers Willmar, Minnesota, to be his hometown. He graduated from Willmar Senior High School, Willmar, Minnesota, in 1968. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Harvey Mudd College in 1972, and a Master of Science and a Doctor of Philosophy degrees in astronomy from the University of Washington in 1974 and 1978, respectively.

Nelson was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of First Class Scout.

His wife, Susie, is from Alhambra, California. They have two daughters, Aimee Tess (born April 25, 1972) and Marti Ann (born February 27, 1975). Pinky enjoys playing golf, reading, swimming, running, and music.

==Research==
Nelson performed astronomical research at the Sacramento Peak Solar Observatory, Sunspot, New Mexico; the Astronomical Institute at Utrecht (Utrecht, Netherlands) and the University of Göttingen Observatory, (Göttingen, West Germany), and at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (Boulder, Colorado). His last research was in systemic education reform and the preparation of science teachers.

==NASA career==
George was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978. He flew as a scientific equipment operator in the WB-57F earth resources aircraft and served as the Astronaut Office representative in the Space Shuttle Extravehicular Mobility Unit (space suit) development effort. During STS-1 he was the photographer in the prime chase plane. He also served as support crewman and CAPCOM for the last two OFT flights, STS-3 and STS-4, and as head of the Astronaut Office Mission Development Group. A veteran of three space flights, Nelson served aboard STS-41-C in 1984, STS-61C in 1986 and STS-26 in 1988. He has logged a total of 411 hours in space, including 10 hours of EVA flight time.

===Spaceflight experience===

====STS-41-C &quot;Challenger&quot;====
This was a seven-day (April 6–13, 1984) mission during which the crew successfully deployed the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), retrieved the ailing Solar Maximum satellite, repaired it on board the Orbiter, and replaced it in orbit. The mission also included flight testing of Manned Maneuvering Units (MMUs) in two extravehicular activities (EVAs), and operation of the Cinema 360 and IMAX Camera Systems. Nelson performed EVAs in support of the satellite retrieval and the MMU testing.

====STS-61-C &quot;Columbia&quot;====

This mission, from January 12–18, 1986, launched from the Kennedy Space Center and returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the six-day flight, the crew deployed the SATCOM KU satellite and conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials processing.

====STS-26 &quot;Discovery&quot;====

This mission (September 29–October 3, 1988) was the first flown after the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident. During the four-day flight, the crew successfully deployed the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C) and operated eleven mid-deck science experiments. The mission completed 64 orbits of the Earth and landed on October 3, 1988.

==Post-NASA career==
Nelson left NASA in June 1989, became an assistant provost at the University of Washington, and now directs the Science, Mathematics and Technology Education program at Western Washington University in Bellingham. He is also the principal investigator of the North Cascades and Olympic Science Partnership, a mathematics and science partnership grant from the National Science Foundation. Nelson served as faculty on the Fall 2013 Semester at Sea voyage, where he taught introductory astronomy and celestial navigation.

==Honors==

NASA Exceptional Engineering Achievement Medal, NASA Exceptional Service Medal, 3 NASA Space Flight Medals, AIAA Haley Space Flight Award, Fédération Aéronautique Internationale V. M. Komarov Diploma, Western Washington University Faculty Outstanding Service Award. In 2009, Nelson was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame. He is also an elected member of Washington State Academy of Science and an Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<text>James Dougal Adrianus &quot;Ox&quot; van Hoften (born June 11, 1944) is an American civil and hydraulic engineer, retired U.S. Navy officer and aviator, and a former astronaut for NASA.

==Personal data==
Van Hoften was born June 11, 1944, in Fresno, California. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout. He considers Burlingame, California, to be his hometown. He is of Dutch descent. Van Hoften is married to the former Vallarie Davis of Pasadena, with three children. He enjoys skiing, playing handball and racquetball, and jogging. In college, he was a member of the Alpha Sigma chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha.

==Education==
Graduated from Mills High School, Millbrae, California, in 1962; received a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1966; a Master of Science and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in hydraulic engineering from Colorado State University in 1968 and 1976, respectively.

==Flight experience==
From 1969 to 1974, Van Hoften was a pilot in the United States Navy. He received flight training at Pensacola, Florida, and completed jet pilot training at Beeville, Texas, in November 1970. He was then assigned to the Naval Air Station, Miramar, California, to fly F-4 Phantoms, and subsequently to VF-121 Replacement Air Group. As a pilot with VF-154 assigned to the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Ranger&quot; in 1972, Van Hoften participated in two cruises to Southeast Asia where he flew approximately 60 combat missions during the Vietnam War. He resumed his academic studies in 1974, and completed a dissertation on the interaction of waves and turbulent channel flow for his doctorate.

In September 1976, he accepted an assistant professorship of Civil Engineering at the University of Houston, and until his selection as an astronaut candidate, taught fluid mechanics and conducted research on biomedical fluid flows concerning flows in artificial internal organs and valves. Dr. Van Hoften has published a number of papers on turbulence, waves, and cardiovascular flows. From 1977 until 1980 he flew F-4N&#x27;s with Naval Reserve Fighter Squadron 201 at NAS Dallas and then three years as a member of the Texas Air National Guard with the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group at Ellington Field as a pilot in the F-4C.

He has logged 3,300 hours flying time, the majority in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==
Dr. Van Hoften was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978. He completed a 1-year training and evaluation period in August 1979.

From 1979 through the first flight, STS-1, Van Hoften supported the Space Shuttle entry and on-orbit guidance, navigation and flight control testing at the Flight Systems Laboratory at Downey, California. Subsequently, he was lead of the Astronaut Support Team at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, responsible for the Space Shuttle turn-around testing and flight preparations. He served as a mission specialist on STS-41-C in 1984, and STS-51-I in 1985. Dr. Van Hoften has logged a total 338 hours in space, including 22 hours of EVA flight time.

===Spaceflight experience===

STS-41-C: &quot;Challenger&quot; (April 6–13, 1984) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 7-day mission the crew successfully deployed the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF); retrieved the ailing Solar Maximum Mission satellite, repaired it on board the orbiting &quot;Challenger&quot; and replaced it in orbit, using the robot arm called the Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The mission also included flight testing of Manned Maneuvering Units (MMU&#x27;s) in two extra-vehicular activities (EVA&#x27;s); operation of the Cinema 360 and IMAX Camera Systems, as well as a Bee Hive Honeycomb Structures student experiment. The mission was accomplished in 107 Earth orbits in 167 hours, 40 minutes, 7 seconds.

STS-51-I: &quot;Discovery&quot; (August 27 to September 3, 1985) launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During this mission, the crew successfully deployed three communications satellites, the Navy&#x27;s Syncom IV-4, Australian AUSSAT, and American Satellite Company&#x27;s ASC-1. The crew also performed the successful salvage of the ailing Navy Syncom IV-3 satellite. These tasks included two extravehicular activities (EVA&#x27;s) in which Dr. Van Hoften attached to the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) performed the first manual grapple and manual deployment of a satellite in orbit. The mission also included the Physical Vapor Transport of Organic Solids (PVTOS), the second material processing experiment to be flown aboard a Shuttle for 3M. The mission was accomplished in 112 orbits of the Earth in 171 hours, 17 minutes, 42 seconds.

==Post-NASA career==
Dr. Van Hoften is a former senior Vice President and partner of the Bechtel Corporation. He was managing director of the global airport design and construction business and was responsible for airport developments in the Middle East, Japan, and North and South America. In the early 1990s, he was the program manager of the $23 billion Hong Kong Airport Core Programme including the new Hong Kong Airport. He later acted as Director of Projects for the UK National Air Traffic Services. In 2009 he was appointed a non-executive director of Gatwick Airport.

==Organizations==

<doc id="547201" wikidata="Q1758597" url="?curid=547201" title="Quadrupole magnet">
<text>Quadrupole magnets, abbreviated as Q-magnets, consist of groups of four magnets laid out so that in the planar multipole expansion of the field, the dipole terms cancel and where the lowest significant terms in the field equations are quadrupole. Quadrupole magnets are useful as they create a magnetic field whose magnitude grows rapidly with the radial distance from its longitudinal axis. This is used in particle beam focusing.

The simplest magnetic quadrupole is two identical bar magnets parallel to each other such that the north pole of one is next to the south of the other and vice versa. Such a configuration will have no dipole moment, and its field will decrease at large distances faster than that of a dipole. A stronger version with very little external field involves using a &quot;k&quot;=3 Halbach cylinder.

In some designs of quadrupoles using electromagnets, there are four steel pole tips: two opposing magnetic north poles and two opposing magnetic south poles. The steel is magnetized by a large electric current in the coils of tubing wrapped around the poles. Another design is a Helmholtz coil layout but with the current in one of the coils reversed.

==Quadrupoles in particle accelerators==


At the particle speeds reached in high energy particle accelerators, the magnetic force term is larger than the electric term in the Lorentz force:
:formula_1
and thus magnetic deflection is more effective than electrostatic deflection. Therefore a &#x27;lattice&#x27; of electromagnets is used to bend, steer and focus a charged particle beam. 

The quadrupoles in the lattice are of two types: &#x27;F quadrupoles&#x27; (which are horizontally focusing but vertically defocusing) and &#x27;D quadrupoles&#x27; (which are vertically focusing but horizontally defocusing). This situation is due to the laws of electromagnetism (the Maxwell equations) which show that it is impossible for a quadrupole to focus in both planes at the same time. The image on the right shows an example of a quadrupole focusing in the vertical direction for a positively charged particle going into the image plane (forces above and below the center point towards the center) while defocusing in the horizontal direction (forces left and right of the center point away from the center). 

If an F quadrupole and a D quadrupole are placed immediately next to each other, their fields completely cancel out (in accordance with Earnshaw&#x27;s theorem). But if there is a space between them (and the length of this has been correctly chosen), the overall effect is focusing in both horizontal and vertical planes. A lattice can then be built up enabling the transport of the beam over long distances—for example round an entire ring. A common lattice is a FODO lattice consisting of a basis of a focusing quadrupole, &#x27;nothing&#x27; (often a bending magnet), a defocusing quadrupole and another length of &#x27;nothing&#x27;.

== Equations of motion and focal length for charged particles ==
A charged particle beam in a quadrupole magnetic field will experience a focusing / defocusing force in the transverse direction. This focusing effect is summed up by a focusing strength formula_2 which depends on the quadrupole gradient formula_3 as well as the beam&#x27;s rigidity formula_4, where formula_5 is the electric charge of the particle and

:formula_6

is the relativistic momentum. The focusing strength is given by

:formula_7,

and particles in the magnetic will behave according to the ODE

:formula_8.

The same equation will be true for the y direction, but with a minus sign in front of the focusing strength to account for the field changing directions.

==Quadrupole ideal field==
The components of the ideal magnetic field in the plane transverse to the beam are given by the following (see also multipole magnet).

: formula_9

where formula_10 is the field gradient of the normal quadrupole component and formula_11 is the field gradient of the skew quadrupole component. The SI unit of the field gradients are formula_12. The field in a normal quadrupole is such that the magnetic poles are arranged with an angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal and vertical planes. The sign of formula_13 determines whether (for a fixed particle charge and direction) the quadrupole focuses or defocuses particles in the horizontal plane.

<text>Santa Marta (), officially the Distrito Turístico, Cultural e Histórico de Santa Marta (), is a port city on the coast of the Caribbean Sea in northern Colombia. It is the capital of Magdalena Department and the fourth-largest urban city of the Caribbean Region of Colombia, after Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Soledad. Founded on July 29, 1525, by the Spanish conqueror Rodrigo de Bastidas, it was one of the first Spanish settlements in Colombia, its oldest surviving city, and second-oldest in South America. This city is situated on a bay by the same name and as such, it is a prime tourist destination in the Caribbean region.

== History ==

=== Pre-Columbian times ===

Before the arrival of Europeans, the South American continent was inhabited by a number of indigenous groups. Due to a combination of tropical weather, significant rainfall, and the destruction and misrepresentation of many records by Spanish conquistadors, our understanding of the peoples of this region is limited.

The Tairona formed mid- to large-size population centers, consisting of stone pathways, terraces, protected waterways, and spaces dedicated to agricultural produce. Their economy was primarily agricultural, cultivating corn, pineapple, yucca, and other local foodstuffs. The Tayrona are considered quite advanced for their time period. Surviving archaeological sites consisted of formed terraces and small scale underground stone channels. They were known to actively collect and process salt, which was a significant trading commodity. 

They traded with other indigenous groups along the coast and interior. Archaeological excavations have recovered significant works in pottery, stonework and gold.

==Simón Bolívar==
Simón Bolívar, the liberator of much of South America, spent his last weeks in Santa Marta, and died of tuberculosis in 1830, at the age of 47 at Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino, Santa Marta. He was buried in the cathedral of Santa Marta, but subsequently his remains were moved to Caracas.

==University==

The Universidad del Magdalena is located in Santa Marta.

==Flag==
Santa Marta&#x27;s flag consists of two colors: white and blue. White symbolises peace, in that all are united without restriction. Blue symbolises the sky, the sea, the magic found in the horizon, and the snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountains.

==Geography==
Santa Marta is located on Santa Marta Bay of the Caribbean Sea in the province of Magdalena. It is 992 km from Bogotá and 93 km from Barranquilla. It is bordered to the north and west by the Caribbean and to the south by the municipalities of Aracataca and Ciénaga.

== Climate ==
Santa Marta experiences a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;), bordering on a hot semi-arid climate, with largely uniform temperatures year round. The dry season lasts from December to April, while the wet season lasts from May to November.



==Economy==
Santa Marta&#x27;s economy is based on tourism, trade, port activities, fishing and agriculture, in that order. The main agricultural products are: bananas, coffee, cocoa and cassava.

=== Infrastructure ===
Santa Marta is a major port. Simón Bolívar International Airport is from the city centre. Historic figure Simón Bolívar died here, a significant event for South America as a whole. His villa known as La Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino is located just outside the city centre. As the main city centre is located close to the coast, the city itself has had difficulty controlling expansion. Although, technically a separate locality, Rodadero is part of Santa Marta itself.

<doc id="547215" wikidata="Q4386885" url="?curid=547215" title="Baddesley Clinton">
<text>Baddesley Clinton () is a moated manor house, about 8 miles (13 km) north-west of the town of Warwick, in the village of Baddesley Clinton, Warwickshire, England. The house probably originated in the 13th century, when large areas of the Forest of Arden were cleared for farmland. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and the house is a Grade I listed building. The house, park and gardens are owned by the National Trust and open to the public; they lie in a civil parish of the same name.

==History==

In 1438, John Brome, Under-Treasurer of England, purchased the manor, which passed to his son, Nicholas Brome (d.1517), who rebuilt the nearby parish church dedicated to St Michael, as a penance for having murdered the parish priest, a crime reputed to have been committed inside the house. The house from this period was equipped with gun-ports, and possibly a drawbridge over the moat. When Nicholas Brome died in 1517, the house passed to his daughter, who in 1500 had married Sir Edward Ferrers, Sheriff of Warwickshire. The house remained in the Ferrers family until 1940, when it was purchased by Thomas Walker, a relative of the family who changed his name to Ferrers. His son, who inherited it in 1970, sold the estate in 1980 to the National Trust, which now manages it.

Henry Ferrers (1549–1633), &quot;The Antiquary&quot;, believed to have built the great hall, made many additions to Baddesley Clinton, including starting the tradition of installing stained glass to represent the family&#x27;s coat of arms. Such glass survives in many rooms. In the 18th century the great hall was rebuilt in brick and the east range was extended, though with great care to continue the style of the original building.

The house was inhabited in the 1860s by the novelists Georgiana Chatterton and her second husband Edward Heneage Dering, who both converted to Roman Catholicism. The house&#x27;s Catholic chapel was rebuilt, and the house was generally refurbished. Major interior changes took place up until the 1940s, with the first floor outside the chapel being completely altered. The interior comprises a great hall, parlour and library, with other rooms, and contains much 16th century carving and furniture and 19th century accessories used by later inhabitants. The house is surrounded by extensive formal gardens and ponds. Many of the farm buildings were built in the 18th century.

==Relationship with Catholicism==

The Ferrers appear to have remained Roman Catholic recusants after the Reformation, along with many other members of the Warwickshire gentry. They sheltered Catholic priests, who were under threat of a death sentence if discovered, and made special arrangements to hide and protect them. Several priest holes were built, secret passages to hide people in the event of a search by the authorities. One such priest hole is in the roof and is reputed to hold six people. A second is hidden in an old privy. Fugitives were able to slide down a rope from the first floor through the old garderobe shaft into the house&#x27;s sewers, which run the length of the building, which could hold six or seven people with their clothes and the equipment required for a Mass. These priest holes are said to have been built by Saint Nicholas Owen, a lay-brother of the Jesuits who constructed many masterful hides, notably at nearby Harvington Hall. He was eventually caught and tortured to death by the Protestant English government. A third space off the Moat Room, is simply a small room with a door hidden in the wood panelling and there is no real evidence that this is a hide. 

The priest holes came into use at least once, in 1591 when a conference of Jesuit priests was raided by local authorities. The search is described in the Autobiography of Fr John Gerard, who was hiding during the search. The hides proved effective as no-one was caught.

== Gardens and parkland ==

Parkland to the north and south-east of the house is today meadow with scattered trees, and ornamental trees south of the house. Pleasure grounds to the south-west lead down to a small lake. A formal walled garden, used in the past as a kitchen garden. lies to the south of the house; the central courtyard of the house is also laid out as a garden. The park and gardens are designated Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==Filming location==
In 1986 a number of exterior and interior shots of Baddesley Clinton were used by Granada Television for its &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; series in the episode &quot;The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual&quot;. In October 2016 the house was the venue for BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;.

Although described as &quot;Baddesley Clinton&quot; on the screen, the location used for the outdoor filming of the first episode of the 2017 BBC One miniseries &quot;Gunpowder&quot; depicting events surrounding the 1603 Main Plot raid was not actually Baddesley Clinton, but was Fountains Hall near Ripon in Yorkshire.

<doc id="547219" wikidata="Q1227285" url="?curid=547219" title="Dipole magnet">
<text>A dipole magnet is the simplest type of magnet. It has two poles, one north and one south. Its magnetic field lines form simple closed loops which emerge from the north pole, re-enter at the south pole, then pass through the body of the magnet. The simplest example of a dipole magnet is a &quot;bar magnet&quot;.

==Dipole magnets in accelerators==
In particle accelerators, a dipole magnet is the electromagnet used to create a homogeneous magnetic field over some distance. Particle motion in that field will be circular in a plane that is perpendicular to the field and collinear to the direction of particle motion, and free in the direction orthogonal to it.
Thus, a particle injected into a dipole magnet will travel on a circular or helical trajectory. By adding several dipole sections on the same plane, the bending radial effect of the beam increases.

In accelerator physics, dipole magnets are used to realize &quot;bends&quot; in the design trajectory (or &#x27;orbit&#x27;) of the particles, as in circular accelerators. Other uses include:
* Injection of particles into the accelerator
* Ejection of particles from the accelerator
* Correction of orbit errors
* Production of synchrotron radiation

The force on a charged particle in a particle accelerator from a dipole magnet can be described by the Lorentz force law, where a charged particle experiences a force of 
:formula_1 
(in SI units). In the case of a particle accelerator dipole magnet, the charged particle beam is bent via the cross product of the particle&#x27;s velocity and the magnetic field vector, with direction also being dependent on the charge of the particle.

The amount of force that can be applied to a charged particle by a dipole magnet is one of the limiting factors for modern synchrotron and cyclotron proton and ion accelerators. As the energy of the accelerated particles increases, they require more force to change direction and require larger B fields to be steered. Limitations on the amount of B field that can be produced with modern dipole electromagnets require synchrotrons/cyclotrons to increase in size (thus increasing the number of dipole magnets used) to compensate for increases in particle velocity. In the largest modern synchrotron, the Large Hadron Collider, there are 1232 main dipole magnets used for bending the path of the particle beam, each weighing 35 metric tons.

==Other uses==
Other uses of dipole magnets to deflect moving particles include isotope mass measurement in mass spectrometry, and particle momentum measurement in particle physics.

Such magnets are also used in traditional televisions, which contain a cathode-ray tube, which is essentially a small particle accelerator. Their magnets are called &quot;deflecting coils&quot;. The magnets move a single spot on the screen of the TV tube in a controlled way all over the screen.

<text>Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) is an organic substance that is involved in photosynthesis, notably as the principal acceptor in plants. It is a colourless anion, a double phosphate ester of the ketopentose (ketone-containing sugar with five carbon atoms) called ribulose. Salts of RuBP can be isolated, but its crucial biological function happens in solution. RuBP occurs not only in plants but in all domains of life, including Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.

==History==
RuBP was originally discovered by Andrew Benson in 1951 while working in the lab of Melvin Calvin at UC Berkeley. Calvin, who had been away from the lab at the time of discovery and was not listed as a co-author, controversially removed the full molecule name from the title of the initial paper, identifying it solely as &quot;ribulose&quot;. At the time, the molecule was known as &quot;ribulose diphosphate&quot; (RDP or RuDP) but the prefix was changed to to emphasize the nonadjacency of the two phosphate groups.

==Role in photosynthesis and the Calvin-Benson Cycle==

The enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (rubisco) catalyzes the reaction between RuBP and carbon dioxide. The product is the highly unstable six-carbon intermediate known as 3-keto-2-carboxyarabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate, or 2&#x27;-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (CKABP). This six-carbon β-ketoacid intermediate hydrates into another six-carbon intermediate in the form of a gem-diol. This intermediate then cleaves into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) which is used in a number of metabolic pathways and is converted into glucose.

In the Calvin-Benson cycle, RuBP is a product of the phosphorylation of ribulose-5-phosphate (produced by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) by ATP.
===Interactions with rubisco===
RuBP acts as an enzyme inhibitor for the enzyme rubisco, which regulates the net activity of carbon fixation. When RuBP is bound to an active site of rubisco, the ability to activate via carbamylation with and is blocked. The functionality of rubisco activase involves removing RuBP and other inhibitory bonded molecules to re-enable carbamylation on the active site.

==Role in photorespiration==

Rubisco also catalyzes RuBP with oxygen () in an interaction called photorespiration, a process that is more prevalent at high temperatures. During photorespiration RuBP combines with to become 3-PGA and phosphoglycolic acid. Like the Calvin-Benson Cycle, the photorespiratory pathway has been noted for its enzymatic inefficiency although this characterization of the enzymatic kinetics of rubisco has been contested. Due to enhanced RuBP carboxylation and decreased rubisco oxygenation stemming from the increased concentration of in the bundle sheath, rates of photorespiration are decreased in plants. Similarly, photorespiration is limited in CAM photosynthesis due to kinetic delays in enzyme activation, again stemming from the ratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen.

==Measurement==
RuBP can be measured isotopically via the conversion of and RuBP into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. G3P can then be measured using an enzymatic optical assay. Given the abundance of RuBP in biological samples, an added difficulty is distinguishing particular reservoirs of the substrate, such as the RuBP internal to a chloroplast vs external. One approach to resolving this is by subtractive inference, or measuring the total RuBP of a system, removing a reservoir (e.g. by centrifugation), re-measuring the total RuBP, and using the difference to infer the concentration in the given repository.

<doc id="547223" wikidata="Q143227" url="?curid=547223" title="Saint-Georges, Quebec">
<text>Saint-Georges () is a city in the province of Quebec, Canada. It is the seat of Beauce-Sartigan Regional County Municipality, part of the Chaudière-Appalaches region. The population was 32,935 as of the Canada 2021 Census. Route 173 runs through Saint-Georges Est (where it is known as Boulevard Lacroix) and heads south to the border with Maine, United States.

The name of the parish and of the city, Saint-Georges, is in homage to George Pozer, the fourth &quot;seigneur&quot; of Aubert-Gallion.

The Beauce-Etchemin School Board (&quot;Commission scolaire de la Beauce-Etchemin&quot;) has its headquarters on 118th Street. Saint-Georges is home to the Cégep Beauce-Appalaches.

In 2002, it amalgamated with Saint-Georges-Est (pop. 4,110), Aubert-Gallion (pop. 2,444) and Saint-Jean-de-la-Lande (pop. 786).

It is home to one of the few inflatable dams, introduced to raise the water level of the Chaudière River for water-based activities and to make the riverside more attractive. Pedestrian bridges were also built over the river as part of the same project.

==History==
The history of Saint-Georges goes back to the late seventeenth century, at which point the region was inhabited principally by the Algonquin people, also known as the Anishinaabe. The first European presence recorded is that of a Jesuit missionary called Father Gabriel Druillettes who made three visits in 1646, 1650, and finally in 1651, but there was no colonial settlement established at this time. By the middle of the next century, however, two colonial &quot;seigneuries&quot; had been established on the present site of Saint-Georges: these were Aubin-de-l&#x27;Isle and Aubert-Gallion. Records indicate that in 1760, one of them, Aubert-Gallion, passed into the hands of Marie-Anne Josephte de l&#x27;Estrigant de St-Martin and of her daughter Charlotte-Marie-Anne-Joseph Aubert de la Chesnaye. The two heiresses sold their inheritance in 1768 to William Grant, a Scotsman with ambitions to become a major Canadian landowner. Grant died in 1805 or 1807 (sources differ), and the estate was sold again, this time to the German (at least by birthplace) Johann Georg Pfotzer. The canonical parish of Saint-Georges was created in 1835, and the secular parish/municipality in 1856.

==Geography==
Saint-Georges is located 85 km south of Quebec City, 125 km northeast of Sherbrooke and 40 km north of the state of Maine. The other towns of some importance in the vicinity, Lévis and Thetford Mines, are located respectively 80 km to the north and 50 km to the west of Saint-Georges. Saint-Georges shares its borders with Saint-Honoré-de-Shenley to the southwest, with Saint-Benoît-Labre to the west. Notre-Dame-des-Pins, Saint-Simon-les-Mines and Saint-Benjamin are the neighboring municipalities to the north. The border is shared with Saint-Prosper, Saint-Philibert, Saint-Côme–Linière while the southeast is shared with Saint-Martin and Saint-René.

Downtown Saint-Georges extends on both banks of the Chaudière River in the center of the territory; another urban core, the neighborhood of Saint-Jean-de-la-Lande is located southwest of downtown. Saint-Georges is located north of the Beauce-Sartigan Regional County Municipality in the administrative region of Chaudière-Appalaches. The three catholic parishes, L&#x27;Assomption-de-la-Bienheureuse-Vierge-Marie, Saint-Georges and Saint-Jean-de-la-Lande, are part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec. The city is part of the Beauce tourist sub-region, which is located in the Chaudière-Appalaches tourist region.

==Economy==
Although a relatively small city, Saint-Georges is often considered the &quot;Metropolis&quot; of Beauce Region because it&#x27;s the largest city in the region. Saint-Georges is an important manufacturing centre, including textiles, steel forgings, garage doors, bicycles and truck trailers. The town is home to the headquarters of the Canam Group, a construction company, and Manac (trailers), the biggest semi-trailer manufacturer in Canada. Both these companies are under operation of the Dutil family. The city has a wide array of local and national retailers and restaurants, as well as many services including financial institutions, schools of different levels, medical clinics, a hospital and several others that are not found elsewhere in the region. Carrefour Saint-Georges is the largest shopping mall in town and in the region.

Saint-Georges is the headquarters of the intercity bus company Autocars La Chaudière, which provides bus services in the Beauce Region to Quebec City. The city also has a regional airport. The extension of Autoroute 73 from Beauceville, Quebec, approximately to the north, to Saint-Georges was discussed for almost thirty years before finally being completed in 2016.

Apparently, Licinian, who was a senator, had the support of the Roman Senate and parts of the population when he initiated an uprising against Decius, who was fighting the Goths. However, Valerian, who had been left in charge in Rome by Decius, had little trouble in suppressing the rebellion.

It is possible that Licinian was the same Valens Senior, who usurped the purple in Rome during the absence of the Emperor Decius in the war against the Goths (250), and who was quickly executed.

<text>In geography, a pole of inaccessibility is the farthest (or most difficult to reach) location in a given landmass, sea, or other topographical feature, starting from a given boundary, relative to a given criterion. A geographical criterion of inaccessibility marks a location that is the most challenging to reach according to that criterion. Often it refers to the most distant point from the coastline, implying the farthest point into a landmass from the shore, or the farthest point into a body of water from the shore. In these cases, a pole of inaccessibility is the center of a maximally large circle that can be drawn within an area of interest only touching but not crossing a coastline. Where a coast is imprecisely defined, the pole will be similarly imprecise.

==Northern pole of inaccessibility==
The northern pole of inaccessibility, sometimes known as the Arctic pole, is located on the Arctic Ocean pack ice at a distance farthest from any landmass. The original position was wrongly believed to lie at 84°3′N 174°51′W. It is not clear who first defined this point, but it may have been Sir Hubert Wilkins, who wished to traverse the Arctic Ocean by aircraft in 1927. He was finally successful in 1928. In 1968 Sir Wally Herbert came very close to reaching what was then considered to be the position by dogsled, but by his own account, &quot;Across the Top of the World&quot;, did not make it due to the flow of sea ice. In 1986, an expedition of Soviet polar scientists led by Dmitry Shparo claimed to reach the original position by foot during a polar night.

In 2005, explorer Jim McNeill asked scientists from The National Snow and Ice Data Center and Scott Polar Research Institute to re-establish the position using modern GPS and satellite technology. This was published as a paper in the &quot;Polar Record&quot;, Cambridge University Press in 2013. McNeill launched his own, unsuccessful attempt to reach the new position in 2006, while measuring the depth of sea-ice for NASA. In 2010 he and his Ice Warrior team were thwarted again by the poor condition of the sea ice.

The new position lies at , from the three closest landmasses: Henrietta Island in the De Long Islands, at Arctic Cape on Severnaya Zemlya, and on Ellesmere Island. It is over from the originally accepted position. Due to constant motion of the pack ice, no permanent structure can exist at this pole. On 12 September 2024, the French icebreaking cruise ship &quot;Le Commandant Charcot&quot; became the first ship to reach the Northern Pole of Inaccessibility.

==Southern pole of inaccessibility==

The southern pole of inaccessibility is the point on the Antarctic continent most distant from the Southern Ocean. A variety of coordinate locations have been given for this pole. The discrepancies are due to the question of whether the &quot;coast&quot; is measured to the grounding line or the edges of ice shelves, the difficulty of determining the location of the &quot;solid&quot; coastline, the movement of ice sheets and improvements in the accuracy of survey data over the years, as well as possible topographical errors.

The point commonly referred to as the pole of inaccessibility is the site of the Soviet Union research station mentioned below, which was constructed at (though some sources give ). This lies from the South Pole, at an elevation of . Using different criteria, the Scott Polar Research Institute locates this pole at .

Using recent datasets and cross-confirmation between the adaptive gridding and B9-Hillclimbing methods discussed below, Rees et al. (2021) identify two poles of inaccessibility for Antarctica: an &quot;outer&quot; pole defined by the edge of Antarctica&#x27;s floating ice shelves and an &quot;inner&quot; pole defined by the grounding lines of these sheets. They find the Outer pole to be at , from the ocean, and the Inner pole to be at , from the grounding lines.

The southern pole of inaccessibility is far more remote and difficult to reach than the geographic South Pole. On 14 December 1958, the 3rd Soviet Antarctic Expedition for International Geophysical Year research work, led by Yevgeny Tolstikov, established the temporary Pole of Inaccessibility Station (, ) at . A second Russian team returned there in 1967. Today, a building still remains at this location, marked by a bust of Vladimir Lenin that faces towards Moscow, and protected as a historical site.

On 11 December 2005, at 7:57 UTC, Ramón Hernando de Larramendi, Juan Manuel Viu, and Ignacio Oficialdegui, members of the Spanish Transantarctic Expedition, reached for the first time in history the southern pole of inaccessibility at , updated that year by the British Antarctic Survey. The team continued their journey towards the second southern pole of inaccessibility, the one that accounts for the ice shelves as well as the continental land, and they were the first expedition to reach it, on 14 December 2005, at . Both achievements took place within an ambitious pioneer crossing of the eastern Antarctic Plateau that started at Novolazarevskaya Station and ended at Progress Base after more than . This was the fastest polar journey ever achieved without mechanical aid, with an average rate of around per day and a maximum of per day, using kites as their power source.

On 4 December 2006, Team N2i, consisting of Henry Cookson, Rupert Longsdon, Rory Sweet and Paul Landry, embarked on an expedition to be the first to reach the historic pole of inaccessibility location without direct mechanical assistance, using a combination of traditional man hauling and kite skiing. The team reached the old abandoned station on 19 January 2007, rediscovering the forgotten statue of Lenin left there by the Soviets some 48 years previously. The team found that only the bust on top of the building remained visible; the rest was buried under the snow. The explorers were picked up from the spot by a plane from Vostok base, flown to Progress Base and taken back to Cape Town on the &quot;Akademik Fyodorov&quot;, a Russian polar research vessel.

On 27 December 2011, Sebastian Copeland and partner Eric McNair-Laundry also reached the southern pole of inaccessibility. They were the first to do so without resupply or mechanical support, departing from Novolazarevskaya Station on their way to the South Pole to complete the first East/West crossing of Antarctica through both poles, over .

As mentioned above, due to improvements in technology and the position of the continental edge of Antarctica being debated, the exact position of the best estimate of the pole of inaccessibility may vary. However, for the convenience of sport expeditions, a fixed point is preferred, and the Soviet station has been used for this role. This has been recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for Team N2i&#x27;s expedition in 2006–2007.

==Oceanic pole of inaccessibility==

The oceanic pole of inaccessibility, also known as Point Nemo, is located at roughly and is the place in the ocean that is farthest from land. It represents the solution to the &quot;longest swim&quot; problem. The problem entails finding such a place in the world ocean where, if a person fell overboard while on a ship at sea, they would be as far away from any land in any direction as possible. It lies in the South Pacific Ocean, and is equally distant from the three closest land vertices which are each roughly away. Those vertices are Pandora Islet of the Ducie Island atoll (an island of the Pitcairn Islands) to the north; Motu Nui (adjacent to Easter Island) to the northeast; and Maher Island (near the larger Siple Island, off the coast of Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica) to the south. The exact coordinates of Point Nemo depend on what the exact coordinates of these three islands are, since the nature of the &quot;longest swim&quot; problem means that the ocean point is equally far from each.

The area is so remote that, since no regular marine or air traffic routes are within , sometimes the closest human beings are astronauts aboard the International Space Station when it passes overhead.

The antipode of Point Nemo – the point on the surface of the Earth that is diametrically opposite of it – is located at roughly , in the Aktobe region of western Kazakhstan, roughly 50 km (30 miles) SSE of the town of Shubarkuduk.

Point Nemo is relatively lifeless; its location within the South Pacific Gyre blocks nutrients from reaching the area, and being so far from land it gets little nutrient run-off from coastal waters.

To the west the region of the South Pacific Ocean is also the site of the geographic center of the water hemisphere, at near New Zealand&#x27;s Bounty Islands. The geographic center of the Pacific Ocean lies further north-west where the Line Islands begin, west from Starbuck Island at .

===History===
Point Nemo was first identified by Croatian survey engineer in 1992. In 2022, Lukatela recalculated the coordinates of Point Nemo using OpenStreetMap data as well as Google Maps data in order to compare those results with the coordinates he first calculated using Digital Chart of the World data.

The point and the areas around it have attracted literary and cultural attention, and the point itself has become known as Point Nemo, a reference to Jules Verne&#x27;s Captain Nemo from the 1870 novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;. The novel was a childhood favorite of Lukatela&#x27;s, and such, he named it after Captain Nemo. The general area plays a major role in the 1928 short story &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot; by H. P. Lovecraft, as holding the location of the fictional city of R&#x27;lyeh, although this story was written 66 years before the identification of Point Nemo.

The wider area is also known as a &quot;spacecraft cemetery&quot; because hundreds of decommissioned satellites, space stations, and other spacecraft have been made to fall there upon re-entering the atmosphere, to lessen the risk of hitting inhabited locations or maritime traffic. The International Space Station (ISS) is planned to crash into Point Nemo in 2031.

==Continental poles of inaccessibility==
===Eurasia===

The Eurasian pole of inaccessibility (EPIA) is located in northwestern China, near the Kazakhstan border. It is also the furthest possible point on land from the ocean, given that Eurasia (or even merely Asia alone) is the largest continent on Earth.

Earlier calculations suggested that it is from the nearest coastline, located at , approximately north of the city of Ürümqi, in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China, in the Gurbantünggüt Desert. The nearest settlements to this location are Hoxtolgay Town at , about to the northwest, Xazgat Township () at , about to the west, and Suluk at , about to the east.

However, the previous pole location disregards the Gulf of Ob as part of the oceans, and a 2007 study proposes two other locations as the ones farther from any ocean (within the uncertainty of coastline definition): EPIA1 and EPIA2 , located respectively at 2,510±10 km (1,560±6 mi) and 2,514±7 km (1,562±4 mi) from the oceans. These points lie in a close triangle about the Dzungarian Gate, a significant historical gateway to migration between the East and West. EPIA2 is located near a settlement called &quot;K̂as K̂îr Su&quot; in a region named &quot;K̂îzîlk̂um&quot; (قىزىلقۇم) in the , Burultokay County.

Elsewhere in Xinjiang, the location in the southwestern suburbs of Ürümqi (Ürümqi County) was designated by local geography experts as the &quot;center point of Asia&quot; in 1992, and a monument to this effect was erected there in the 1990s. The site is a local tourist attraction.

Coincidentally, the continental and oceanic poles of inaccessibility have a similar radius; the Eurasian poles EPIA1 and EPIA2 are about closer to the ocean than the oceanic pole is to land.

===Africa===
In Africa, the pole of inaccessibility is at , from the coast, near the town of Obo in the Central African Republic and close to the country&#x27;s tripoint with South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

===North America===

In North America, the continental pole of inaccessibility is on the Pine Ridge Reservation in southwest South Dakota about north of the town of Allen, from the nearest coastline at . The pole was marked in 2021 with a marker that represents the 7 Lakota Values and the four colors of the Lakota Medicine Wheel.

===South America===
In South America, the continental pole of inaccessibility is in Brazil at , near Arenápolis, Mato Grosso, from the nearest coastline. In 2017, the Turner Twins went from coastal Chile to the South American Pole of Inaccessibility, becoming the first adventurers to go from the nearest coastline to the pole by foot. In 2019, it was discovered that there is a second South American pole of inaccessibility to the north, its position varying greatly between the two coastline datasets used.

===Australia===

In Australia, the continental pole of inaccessibility is located at from the nearest coastline, approximately 161 km (100 miles) west-northwest of Alice Springs. The nearest town is Papunya, Northern Territory, about west-southwest of the pole.

==Methods of calculation==
As detailed below, several factors determine how a pole is calculated using computer modeling.

Poles are calculated with respect to a particular coastline dataset. Currently used datasets are the GSHHG (Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database) as well as OpenStreetMap (OSM) planet dumps. The GSHHG claims 500-meter precision for 90% of identifiable coastal features, while the volunteer-build OSM give no such guarantee but nevertheless &quot;have characteristics suggesting accuracy&quot;.

Next, a distance function must be determined for calculating distances between coastlines and potential Poles. Some works tended to project data onto planes or perform spherical calculations; more recently, other works have used different algorithms and high-performance computing with ellipsoidal calculations.

Finally, an optimization algorithm must be developed. Several works use the 2007 adaptive grid method of Garcia-Castellanos and Lombardo. In this method, a rectangular grid of, e.g., 21×21 points is created. Each point&#x27;s distance from the coastline is determined and the point farthest from the coast identified. The grid is then recentered on this point and shrunk by some factor. This process iterates until the grid becomes very small (e.g. at 100-meter precision). Some authors claim this method could sink into a local minimum. A more recent method from 2019, B9-Hillclimbing by Barnes, uses a polyhedron in 3D space to find initial points evenly spaced by 100 kilometers. These points are then grouped; the more &quot;unique&quot; points are subject to numerical optimization (hill climbing, simulated annealing) for the farthest distance, accelerated by a 3D Cartesian point cloud. Rees (2021) shows that the two methods agree with each other to meter level.

To date there has been no meta-study of the various works, and the algorithms and datasets they use. However, successive works have compared themselves with previous calculations and claimed improvement. For example, the GC &amp; L article from 2007 was able to find hundred-kilometer errors in the &quot;traditional&quot; Eurasian PIA in Crane &amp; Crane, 1987. Rees using the same method updated the arctic PIA by over 200 kilometers. Barnes, which improved upon the method and the dataset used, was able to improve the GC &amp; L South American PIA by 50 kilometers, showing that bad coastline data caused an error of 57 kilometers in their reported PIA-to-coast distance.

Poles of Inaccessibility, as determined by some authors, are listed in the table below. This list is incomplete and may not capture all works done to date.

<text>The &quot;Tromp&quot; class were two frigates built for the Royal Netherlands Navy during the 1970s to replace the s as squadron flagships.

The &quot;Tromp&quot;-class frigates entered service in 1975 and 1976 and served until 1999 and 2001. Both ships were built by Royal Schelde Shipyard in Flushing (Vlissingen). The ships served as fleet flagships and area air defence vessels. Their 3D radar under a large polyester radome gave the ships the nickname &quot;Kojak&quot; in the Netherlands Navy. Originally the ships were to have the British Sea Dart missile system, but this was changed to the more compact American Standard surface-to-air missile.

The ships were replaced by the s. A total of four new frigates have been built, including two also named and .

==Design==
===Armament===
The &quot;Tromp&quot; class frigates were armed with twin (1x2) Bofors 120 mm automatic naval guns with each gun being able to fire 38 to 42 shots per minute at a maximum distance of 21.6 kilometers. Initially the British 4.5-inch naval gun and French 100 mm naval gun were also considered, alongside the Bofors guns. However, as a result of austerity measures it was decided that the Bofors guns were a better option financially. The Bofors guns were refurbished naval guns that had been removed from the HNLMS &quot;Gelderland&quot;. Before installation they were extensively modified and modernized with the help of Wilton-Fijenoord. This resulted in the naval guns becoming considerable more accurate.

==Service history==
In 1977 and 1979 the aluminium deckhouses on both ships were repaired at the shipyard of Koninklijke Maatschappij De Schelde after cracks had been found. As a result all succeeding frigates of the Royal Netherlands Navy had deckhouses made of steel.

In July 1981 the Soviet aircraft carrier &quot;Kiev&quot; entered the North Sea and was escorted by both ships of the &quot;Tromp&quot;-class.

Between 1981 and 1982 Fokker delivered 3 new large radomes for the &quot;Tromp&quot;-class frigates (one for each ship and one for reserve).

<text>Chembur (pronunciation: ) is an upmarket large suburb in central Mumbai, India. It belongs on the harbour line of suburban railways and offers the best connectivity with Mumbai Monorail, Santacruz- Chembur Link Road, Airport, Jeejamata Bhosle Marg (from Chembur-Mankhurd), Eastern Freeway, Eastern Express Highway, BKC connector, and Mumbai Satara highway (Sion-Panvel).

==History==
Before reclamation, Chembur lay on the north-western corner of Trombay Island. It is suggested that Chembur is the same place referred to as Saimur by the Arab writers(915–1137), Sibor in Cosmas Indicopleustes(535), Chemula in the Kanheri cave inscriptions(300–500), Symulla by the author of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea(247), Symulla or Timulla by Ptolemy(150), and perhaps even Perimula by Pliny (A.D. 77). This is, however, disputed. Chembur is also said to be a reference to Chevul at the mouth of the Kundalika River on mainland Maharashtra. Later, the area occupied was said to have occupied a branch of an animal home.

The Bombay Presidency Golf Club was established in 1827, and was later re-built to meet international standards. No major activity occurred until the Kurla-Chembur single railway line was built in 1906 for garbage trains. The line was opened to passenger traffic in 1924. After construction activity in the 1920s, Chembur was finally opened up in the 1930s. It was made part of Bombay City in 1945.

After independence, Chembur was one of the sites where refugee camps were set up to settle Sindhi Hindu refugees after partition. The industrialisation of Trombay during and after World War II led to the demand for housing and the growth of Chembur thereafter.

==Administration==
Chembur belongs to the Mumbai South Central parliamentary constituency. It used to be in Mumbai North-East Parliamentary constituency, prior to delimitation in 2008, where it was moved to Mumbai South Central parliamentary Constituency. The current sitting Member of Parliament of Mumbai South Central is Shiv Sena (UBT) Anil Desai.

The Current Member of the Legislative Assembly of Chembur is Mr. Prakash Vaikunth Phaterpekar of the Shiv Sena (UBT).

Chembur is the seat of the M Ward offices. The M Ward ranges from Thane Creek in the East to Tansa Pipe Line No. 2 in the West, from Somaiyya Nalla in the North to Mahul Creek in the South. Chembur lies inward numbers 141 to 149 with Councillors for each representing it in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.
==Geography==
Chembur is surrounded by the neighborhoods of Kurla, Mankhurd,Wadala, BKC, Trombay, Govandi, Chunabhatti, Vidyavihar and Ghatkopar. A marine alluvium-type of soil is observed in Chembur. It has north–south running basalt hills to its south.

==Transport==
Modes of public transport in Chembur include autorickshaws, online aggregator cabs such as Uber and Ola, taxicabs, BEST buses, NMMT buses, monorail, and trains. Buses are available from Navi Mumbai to Mumbai and vice versa. The Mumbai Metro will serve Chembur when Line 2 enters service.

===Dayanand Saraswati Marg===
Dayanand Saraswati Marg formerly called Central Avenue Road was given its current name in memory of Dayanand Saraswati. Stretches from Chembur Railway Station to Sion Panvel Highway, formerly and commonly called Central Avenue Road. It is lined on both sides mainly with residential complexes and shade trees. In 2008, the height of the road was raised and provided with a sidewalk. The Central Avenue Road is a prime locality in Chembur.

=== Ramkrishna Chemburkar Marg ===
Ramkrishna Chemburkar Marg also known as R.C Marg is located in Chembur. It is named after and a tribute to Ramkrishna Chemburkar a freedom fighter and former chembur corporator. He was elected in 1952 as the corporator of chembur. The road was originally called as Ghatkopar-Mahul road which was changed to Ramkrishna Chemburkar Marg after he died in 1966.

==Environmental problems==
Chembur had pollution problems in the past and was ranked 46th in a list of the most polluted industrial clusters in India. Studies of Chembur have also found high levels of copper, chromium, calcium, arsenic and mercury in groundwater. Effluents from oil refineries, fertilizer plants and reactors in Chembur are also said to have polluted seawater in Thane Creek and affected marine life.

The main problem was the uncontrolled release of ammonia and nitrous oxides from the Rashtriya Chemicals &amp; Fertilisers (RCF) complex. Although ammonia is easy to scrub, the problem seems to be due to improper operation of pollution control equipment and/or operation of the urea/ammonia complex way beyond the design capacity without augmentation of pollution control equipment.

The Deonar dumping ground in Deonar had caused health issues for the residents of Chembur. In 2008, around 40 residents of Chembur went on a hunger strike to protest against the frequent fires and smoke. Again in 2012, the residents complained to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on the smoke coming out of the dumping ground, which has been affecting asthma patients.

<text>Anushakti Nagar is the residential township of the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Nuclear Power Corporation of India, Directorate of Construction Services and Estate Management, Atomic Energy Education Society in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. Anu Shakti means atomic power in Sanskrit. Spread over more than 940 acres, this residential complex for the employees of Department of Atomic Energy of the Government of India in Mumbai, is situated in North-east Mumbai. Anushakti Nagar claims to be the largest scientific community (in a single area) in the world. It has the largest central library in the continent in Nuclear science and technology.

== About ==
In the early 1960s the government decided to expand the nuclear research (see BARC) facility in (what was then) a distant suburb of Mumbai. The township is about 3 km north of the research centre.

Anushakti Nagar is a well planned self-contained community with a population of about 45,000. It has residential flat, sports and recreation facilities, schools, medical clinics, a large hospital, banks, post office and transport links to many parts of Mumbai. It has 6 Shopping Centres commonly known as Markets housing local retailers &amp; supermarket:

* Sector Market
* Hastinapur Market
* Mandala Market
* Western Sector Market
* Brindavan Market
* Kamet Market

The atomic research centre and the town maintenance is funded by the central (federal) government. The complex is sprawling and lies stretched out alongside four suburbs - Govandi, Mankhurd, New Mandala and Trombay. The other facilities include two Community Centres for social occasions and gatherings, various departmental and co-operative stores, 1 restaurant and 1 creche. The electricity to the colony is provided by TATA Power and the cable (and more recently, cablenet) by ANUSAT club. For the benefits of residents, Janta Seva serves an exclusive shopping cart.

Anushakti Nagar has 17 high-rises and numerous buildings, that have grades, depending on flat-size, and are allotted on the basis of seniority to DAE employees. The nomenclature of these buildings is unique, with names taken from:

*Indian heritage (Nalanda, Hastinapur, Pataliputra, Indraprastha, Takshashila, Kapilvastu)
*Rivers (Sindhu, Saraswati, Godavari, Narmada, Saryu, Alaknanda, Bhagirathi, Ghaghra, Gomti, Ganga, Yamuna etc.)

*Himalayan peaks (Kamet, Annapurna, Kanchenjunga, Dhawalgiri, Nandadevi {Nanda Devi}, Gaurishankar {Gauri Sankar}, Everest, Kamet etc.)
*Hill-stations (Venkatgiri, Almora, Gulmarg, Mount Abu, Mussoorie etc.), Hill-ranges (Sahyadri, Vindhya, Satpura, Aravalli, Nilgiri etc.)
*Historical Places (Sanchi, Ajanta, Ellora, Shantiniketan, Sriniketan, Golconda etc.)
*Hindu pilgrimage sites (Kailash, Badrinath, Kedarnath, Dwarka, Sarnath, Bhavani etc.)
*Saints (Meera, Namdev, Jaidev, Ramdas, Tulsidas, Kabir, Tukaram, Chaitanya etc.),
*Classical Ragas (the Raagmala buildings - Mohana, Deepak, Malhar, Darbari, Ranjani, Lalit, Bhairavi etc.)
*Historical schools and colleges (ShriNikentan, Shanti Niketan)

The Mandala &quot;suburb&quot; of this township has buildings named after seasons (Hemant, Sharad, Varsha)

Some buildings of New Mandala are named after flowers like Pankaj, Kamal, Champa, Parijat, Gulmohar, Kumud etc.)

Recent additions to the high-rises are two new buildings: Udayagiri and Malayagiri, both of which are state of the art, spacious and well designed. On 31 October 2023 , Another two new buildings have been inaugurated under the names of &quot;JAINTIA&quot; &amp; &quot;PARASNATH&quot; which takes the total tally upto 19.

The Central Avenue road which divides Anushakti Nagar roughly into two halves, connects its main entrance with the BARC North Gate. It is a 2+2 lane divided by a green stretch which runs all along. The authorities have recently named roads in Anushaktinagar under famous personalities including the Central Avenue Road which was renamed as Dr.Homi.J.Bhabha Marg (Marg means Way in Hindi). Other road names include :

* Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam Marg
* Vidyarthi Marg
* Dr. Shekhar Basu Marg (erst. CISF Marg)
* Dr. Raja Rammanna Marg

Anushakti Nagar can be said to be divided into three parts:

* Anushakti Nagar

* New Mandala

* Western Sector

== Locality ==
Anushakti Nagar is located about 20 km north-east of Mumbai downtown.

It is part of the Mumbai South Central (Lok Sabha constituency) which until mid-1990s was the largest (by population) Lok Sabha constituency in India, but it was called Mumbai North-East then. It is bordered on one side by a large hill which is the highest in Mumbai.

== Education ==
The education up to XII standard for the residents is provided by Atomic Energy Education Society through Atomic Energy Central School (AECS), which are numbered 1 through 6, and a sprawling Atomic Energy Junior College (AEJC) for grades 11 and 12, on the foot of the Trombay Hill. Now the AECS School No. 4 has grade 11 and grade 12 under the CBSE.

These schools cater to about 7000 students. Admission to these schools is strictly for children whose parents or guardians are employees of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and/or the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). Despite the higher quality of education provided through these schools, the fee structure is highly subsidised and is an incentive for many employees to prefer to stay in Anushakti Nagar. Recently the AECS have started admitting grandchildren of the DAE/BARC/NPC employees as well. Non-DAE students are admitted in these schools at higher fees. The school system follows the CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education). The medium of instruction is English.

Anushakti Nagar is host to BARC Training School, established in the year 1956, along with Homi Bhabha National Institute, which is a Deemed University. The BARC Training School is running Orientation Course for Engineering graduates and Science post-graduates (OCES) and serves as in-house human resource training centre for Department of Atomic Energy.
Homi Bhabha National Institute is located near BARC Training School. The HBNI provides an academic framework for integrating basic research being done at its grant-in-aid institutions and the research centres of DAE with technology development at the research centres. The institute trains manpower in the sciences including engineering sciences for taking up a career in nuclear science and technology and related areas in the Department of Atomic Energy or elsewhere. The institute also provides continuing education for the employees of the DAE.

The Training School Hostel (TSH), and the New Bachelor&#x27;s Hostel (NBH) provide accommodation for BARC trainees, as well as for interns and students who come for various academic purposes (like training for International Mathematics Olympiad or International Physics Olympiad etc.)

<doc id="547290" wikidata="Q2542731" url="?curid=547290" title="St. Marys, Ontario">
<text>St. Marys is a town in southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is located at the confluence of the north branch of the Thames River and Trout Creek southwest of Stratford, and is surrounded by the Township of Perth South in Perth County, Ontario. St. Marys operates under its own municipal government that is independent from the county&#x27;s government. Nonetheless, the three entities &quot;enjoy a large degree of collaboration and work together to grow the region as a leading location for industry and people&quot;. Census data published for Perth County by Statistics Canada includes St. Marys and most Perth County publications also do, at least in some sections of the document.

The town is also known by its nickname, &quot;The Stone Town&quot;, due to the abundance of limestone in the surrounding area, giving rise to numerous limestone buildings and homes throughout the town. St. Marys Cement, a large cement producer founded in the town, capitalized on this close feed stock, and grew to be a major producer of cement in the province of Ontario.

St. Marys is home to the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. It is the burial place of Arthur Meighen, Canada&#x27;s ninth prime minister. Timothy Eaton, who went on to become one of Canada&#x27;s most famous retailers, opened his first businesses in Canada in nearby Kirkton, Ontario, and later St. Marys.

==History==
In 1839, the Canada Company sent a surveyor to Blanshard Township in the Huron Tract to choose a site for a town on the Thames River which would later be named St. Marys.

The first settlers arrived at the junction of the Thames River and Trout Creek, southwest of Stratford in the early 1840s, attracted by the area&#x27;s natural resources. At the new town site, the Thames River cascaded over a series of limestone ledges, providing the power to run the first pioneer mills and giving the community an early nickname: Little Falls.

The &quot;Smith&#x27;s Canadian Gazetteer&quot; of 1846 describes the settlement as follows:

It was laid out in 1844, and contains about 120 inhabitants. There is an excellent limestone quarry close to the village. Professions and Trades.—One grist mill, one saw mill, one physician and surgeon, two asheries, three stores, one tavern, one shoemaker, one tailor, one cooper, one blacksmith.

The arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway in the late 1850s increased the growth; the community became a centre for milling, grain-trading and the manufacture of agriculture-related products. In 1854 the community was incorporated as a village and in 1863 as a town. However, it did not incorporate itself into Perth County.

In the riverbed and along the banks, limestone was close to the surface and could be quarried for building materials. Many 19th century limestone structures survive: churches, commercial blocks, and private homes. They have given St. Marys its current nickname: Stonetown.

A plaque erected by the Government of Ontario provides additional details about the early days:

When opening Blanshard Township for settlement in 1839, the Canada Company made an arrangement with Thomas Ingersoll, a brother of Laura Secord, to build mills at &quot;the Little Falls&quot; of the Thames. In 1841-43 he erected a sawmill and a grist-mill and in return obtained 337 acres of land in this vicinity. The mills formed the nucleus of a settlement named St. Marys. The building of railways, 1857–60, stimulated development and in 1864, when St. Marys became a town, it was already the centre of lumber and limestone quarry industries and the adjacent prosperous agricultural region.

The first library was opened in 1857; it belonged to the local Mechanics Institute but had no permanent home and had to rent space where it could. In 1904, the Andrew Carnegie Foundation provided $10,000 for the construction of a library building. It was built and opened on August 17, 1905. By 1913 the shelves contained 4000 books. Major renovations were completed in 1988 including the addition of a new wing.

In 1908, a handle and hockey stick company was founded by Solen Doolittle in the town of St. Marys called the St. Marys Wood Specialty Company. Located on James Street in St. Marys from the early 1900s, it moved to Hespeler, Ontario in 1933. During their time in St. Marys the company made many such items as hammer handles, hockey sticks and baseball bats. After many ownership changes over the years, by 1988 the now-Cooper bat had risen to #2 in the National Baseball League after Louisville Slugger. This success subsequently inspired the town to bid for the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

On January 1, 1998, Perth County was restructured by reducing fourteen municipalities to four. However, the City of Stratford and the Town of St. Marys were unaffected, remaining independent entities.

==Municipal government==
Fully independent of the County of Perth, the Town of St. Marys has its own Mayor and six councillors including the Deputy Mayor. They meet at Town Hall on a regular basis. The Mayor for the 2018–2022 term is Al Strathdee.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, St. Marys had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Attractions==
St. Marys contains many 19th century buildings built with locally quarried limestone. Notable buildings include the Opera House built in 1880, the spired municipal Town Hall built in 1891, and the Public Library built in 1904. The Museum and Archives contains a great deal of historical information, with photographs. The Town Hall theatre offers theatrical productions and events. The Municipal Heritage Committee helps in preserving the historic stone buildings and publishes a useful brochure online, with interesting facts about those in the downtown area.

The Grand Trunk Trail is a walkway transformed from a two kilometre section of the former Grand Trunk Railway line. The trail features a walk over the restored Sarnia bridge, providing panoramic views over the town.

In 2012, the Re-Purposing of the Sarnia Bridge to part of the Grand Trunk Trail was inducted to the North America Railway Hall of Fame. The bridge was inducted in the “Community, Business, Government or Organization&quot; class in the &quot;National&quot; category.

The Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame moved to St. Marys from Toronto in 1994 and opened in 1998. It is dedicated to preserving Canada&#x27;s baseball heritage. Since opening, 75 members (46 players, 23 builders, 2 honorary, 4 honorary teams) have been inducted. It includes professional ballplayers, amateurs, builders, and honorary members who have helped popularize the sport in Canada. The facility also includes a baseball field designed by landscape architect Art Lierman of London, Ontario. There are thousands of artifacts on display in the museum &quot;including Fergie Jenkins and Larry Walker memorabilia, artifacts from Canada&#x27;s two major league franchises, the Toronto Blue Jays and the Montreal Expos, a Babe Ruth collection, a large display on all the current MLB Canadians and a tribute to the Canadian women who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.&quot;

Also on site, there are four ballfields, including the St. Marys Cement Company Field, Rotary Field, King Field and 3rd Field. All these fields were constructed between 1998 and 2014. Over 900 events are held on site each year, including Major League Baseball tryout camps and World Junior Championship exhibition games.

The Wildwood Dam is a dam located on Trout Creek, upstream of the Town of St. Marys.

The Quarries consist of two former limestone quarries located in southern St. Marys, one of which has been rehabilitated as an outdoor swimming pool. The area became a popular swimming spot with locals after filling with water between 1930 and 1935. In 1945 the town bought the quarries along with of surrounding land, and now manages it as a public recreational facility. The quarry is Canada&#x27;s largest outdoor swimming pool.

==Transportation==

St. Marys is located along Highway 7. The town is serviced by Via Rail at St. Marys railway station connecting it to a rail line between Toronto and Sarnia.

==Sports==
The St. Marys Lincolns are a member of the OHA Junior &quot;B&quot; Hockey Association and play in the Western Junior &quot;B&quot; Hockey League (now Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League). They play their home games at the Pyramid Recreation Centre. Prior Lincoln team members who played in the NHL include Terry Crisp, Don Luce, Lonnie Loach, Mark Bell, Steve Shields, J. P. Parisé and Bob Boughner.

<text>A wythe is a continuous vertical section of masonry one unit in thickness. A wythe may be independent of, or interlocked with, the adjoining wythe(s). A single wythe of brick that is not structural in nature is referred to as a masonry veneer.

A multiple-wythe masonry wall may be composed of a single type of masonry unit layered to increase its thickness and structural strength, or different masonry units chosen by function, such as an economical concrete block serving a structural purpose and a more expensive brick chosen for its appearance.

In the Eurocodes, the continuous vertical section is referred to as a &quot;leaf&quot;. A single-leaf wall is a wall without a cavity or continuous vertical joint in its plane. A double-leaf wall is a
wall consisting of two parallel leaves with the longitudinal joint between filled solidly with mortar and securely tied together with wall ties so as to result in common action under load. The difference between the leaf and the wythe is found in the leaf always being joined as one structural element, while wythes may be independent of one another.

<text>Selenite, satin spar, [[Desert rose (crystal)|desert rose]], and gypsum flower are crystal habit varieties of the mineral gypsum.

All varieties of gypsum, including selenite and alabaster, are composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate (meaning that it has two molecules of water), with the chemical formula CaSO4·2H2O. Selenite contains no selenium, the similar names both derive from Greek ( &#x27;Moon&#x27;).

Some of the largest crystals ever found are of selenite, the largest specimen found in the Naica Mine&#x27;s Cave of the Crystals being 12 meters long and weighing 12 tons.

==History and etymology==
&quot;Selenite&quot; is mostly synonymous with gypsum, but from the 15th century, it has named the transparent variety that occurs in crystals or crystalline masses. The name derives through Middle English from Latin , ultimately from Greek (, ). It got this name because people historically believed the mineral waxed and waned with the cycles of the Moon.

==Distinguishing characteristics==
The main distinguishing characteristics of crystalline gypsum are its softness (hardness 2 on Mohs scale, soft enough to scratch with a fingernail) and its three unequal cleavages. Other distinguishing characteristics include its crystal habits, pearly lustre, easy fusibility with loss of water, and solubility in hot dilute hydrochloric acid.

==Varieties==
Though sometimes grouped together as &quot;selenite&quot;, the four crystalline varieties have differences. General identifying descriptions of the related crystalline varieties are:

===Selenite===
* Selenite is most often transparent and colorless.
* If selenite crystals show opacity or color, it is caused by the presence of other minerals, sometimes in druse.

===Satin spar===
* Most often silky and fibrous; chatoyant; can exhibit some coloration
* The satin spar name has also been applied to fibrous calcite (a related calcium mineral), which can be distinguished from gypsum by its greater hardness (Mohs 3), rhombohedral cleavage, and reaction with dilute hydrochloric acid.

===Desert rose===

* -shaped gypsum with outer druse of sand or with sand throughout – most often sand colored (in all the colors that sand can exhibit)
* The desert rose name can also be applied to barite desert roses (another related sulfate mineral) – barite is a harder mineral with higher density

===Gypsum flower===
* Gypsum flowers are curved rosettes of fibrous gypsum crystals found in solution caves.

==Use and history==
Satin spar is sometimes cut into cabochons to best display its chatoyance.

==Crystal habit and properties==

Crystal habit refers to the shapes that crystals exhibit. Selenite crystals show a variety of habits, but the most common are tabular, prismatic, or acicular (columnar) crystals, often with no imperfections or inclusions. Twinned crystals are common, and often take the form of &quot;swallow tail&quot; twins.

Selenite crystals sometimes form in thin tabular or mica-like sheets and have been used as window panes as at Santa Sabina in Rome.

Selenite crystals sometimes will also exhibit bladed rosette habit (usually transparent and like desert roses) often with accompanying transparent, columnar crystals. Selenite crystals can be found both attached to a matrix or base rock, but can commonly be found as entire free-floating crystals, often in clay beds (and as can desert roses).

Satin spar is almost always prismatic and fibrous in a parallel crystal habit. Satin spar often occurs in seams, some of them quite long, and is often attached to a matrix or base rock.

Desert roses are most often bladed, exhibiting the familiar shape of a rose, and almost always have an exterior druse. Desert roses form in wet sand, unattached to a matrix or base rock.

Gypsum flowers are most often acicular, scaly, stellate, and lenticular. Gypsum flowers most often exhibit simple twinning (known as &quot;contact twins&quot;); where parallel, long, needle-like crystals, sometimes having severe curves and bends, will frequently form “ram’s horns”, &quot;fishtail&quot;, &quot;arrow/spear-head&quot;, and &quot;swallowtail&quot; twins. Selenite crystals can also exhibit “arrow/spear-head” as well as “duck-bill” twins. Both selenite crystals and gypsum flowers sometimes form quite densely in acicular mats or nets; and can be quite brittle and fragile. Gypsum flowers are usually attached to a matrix (can be gypsum) or base rock.

===Color===
Gypsum crystals are colorless (most often selenite), white (or pearly – most often satin spar), or gray, but may be tinted brown, yellow, red, or blue by the presence of impurities, such as iron oxides or clay minerals.

===Transparency===
Gypsum crystals can be transparent (most often selenite), translucent (most often satin spar but also selenite and gypsum flowers), and opaque (most often the rosettes and flowers). Opacity can be caused by impurities, inclusions, druse, and crust, and can occur in all four crystalline varieties.

===Luster===
Selenite typically shows vitreous luster, but may show pearly luster on cleavage surfaces. Satin spar shows characteristic silky luster. Luster is not often exhibited in the rosettes, due to their exterior druse; nevertheless, the rosettes often show glassy to pearly luster on edges. Gypsum flowers usually exhibit more luster than desert roses.

===Other optical properties===
Fibrous satin spar exhibits chatoyancy (cat&#x27;s eye effect).

When cut across the fibers and polished on the ends, satin spar exhibits an optical illusion when placed on a printed or pictured surface: print and pictures appear to be on the surface of the sample. It is often called and sold as the “television stone” (as is ulexite).

Some selenite and satin spar specimens exhibit fluorescence or phosphorescence.

===Tenacity===
All four crystalline varieties are slightly flexible, though will break if bent significantly. They are not elastic, meaning they can be bent, but will not bend back on their own.

All four crystalline varieties are sectile in that they can be easily cut, will peel (particularly selenite crystals that exhibit mica-like properties), and like all gypsum varieties, can be scratched by a fingernail (hardness: 2 on Mohs Scale). The rosettes are not quite as soft due to their exterior druse; nevertheless, they too can be scratched.

Selenite crystals that exhibit in either reticular or acicular habits, satin spar, in general (as fibrous crystals are thin and narrow), desert roses that are thinly bladed, and gypsum flowers, particularly acicular gypsum flowers, can be quite brittle and easily broken.

===Size===
All four crystalline varieties can range in size from minute to giant selenite crystals measuring 11 meters long such as those found in the caves of the Naica Mine of Chihuahua, Mexico. The crystals thrived in the cave&#x27;s extremely rare and stable natural environment. Temperatures stayed at 58 °C, and the cave was filled with mineral-rich water that drove the crystals&#x27; growth. The largest of those crystals weighs 55 tons, is long, and is over 500,000 years old.

==Occurrence==
Gypsum occurs on every continent and is the most common of all the sulfate minerals.

Gypsum is formed as an evaporative mineral, frequently found in alkaline lake muds, clay beds, evaporated seas, salt flats, salt springs, and caves. It is frequently found in conjunction with other minerals such as, copper ores, sulfur and sulfides, silver, iron ores, coal, calcite, dolomite, limestone, and opal. Gypsum has been dated to almost every geologic age since the Silurian Period 443.7 ± 1.5 Ma.

In dry, desert conditions and arid areas, sand may become trapped both on the inside and the outside of gypsum crystals as they form. Interior inclusion of sand can take on shapes such as an interior hourglass shape common to selenite crystals of the ancient Great Salt Plains Lake bed, Oklahoma, US. Exterior inclusion (druse) occurs as embedded sand grains on the surface such as, commonly seen in the familiar desert rose.

When gypsum dehydrates severely, anhydrite is formed. If water is reintroduced, gypsum can and will reform – including as the four crystalline varieties. An example of gypsum crystals reforming in modern times is found at Philips Copper Mine (closed and abandoned), Putnam County, New York, US where selenite micro crystal coatings are commonly found on numerous surfaces (rock and otherwise) in the cave and in the dump.

<text>Newmarket Films, LLC was an American privately owned independent film production and distribution company and a former film distribution subsidiary of Newmarket Capital Group. The company produced such films as &quot;The Mexican&quot;, &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, and the Christopher Nolan films &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;The Prestige&quot;. Newmarket distributed, in North America, such films as &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, &quot;Whale Rider&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot;, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, and &quot;God Grew Tired of Us&quot;.

==History==
Newmarket Capital Group was founded in 1994 by Chris Ball and William Tyrer, with the company&#x27;s executive team made up of Chris Calhoon, Rene Cogan, John Crye and Robert Fyvolent. The company was originally launched as a film financing company. Newmarket financed and produced films that had &quot;break-out potential&quot; and finance as small as $2 million and as large as $20 million. While financing and producing &quot;Memento&quot;, the company had trouble trying to find a distribution deal. Producer Aaron Ryder, who brought the film to Newmarket, decided to distribute it as a one-off project under Newmarket Films. &quot;Memento&quot; was a critical and commercial success, thus leading Newmarket Films to become a full theatrical distribution company.

Newmarket Films was acquired by Exclusive Media Group (which eventually became Exclusive Media) in 2009. In 2010, Newmarket made a deal with Lionsgate Home Entertainment to become the exclusive home entertainment distributor for Newmarket&#x27;s film library. Later that year, Chris Ball left the company to form the distribution company Wrekin Hill Entertainment; Rene Cogan and John Crye joined him. Exclusive Media then sold its own film library, including the Newmarket library, to AMBI Group in 2015.

<doc id="547299" wikidata="Q3024713" url="?curid=547299" title="Independent International Commission on Decommissioning">
<text>The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) was established to oversee the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons in Northern Ireland, as part of the peace process.

==Legislation and organisation==
An earlier international body, set up during the ceasefires to report on how decommissioning might be achieved, presented its report on 22 January 1996. This recommended that the decommissioning process should take place &quot;to the satisfaction of an independent commission&quot;. The Decommissioning Act, 1997 in the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act 1997 in the United Kingdom enabled such a body, which was then set up in an agreement between the British and Irish governments on 26 August 1997.

The commission was composed of:
* General (Ret.) John de Chastelain, Chairman, from Canada
* Brigadier Tauno Nieminen, from Finland, and 
* Ambassador Donald C. Johnson, from the US, 1997–99, Andrew D. Sens, from the US, 1999–2011

Its objective was to facilitate the decommissioning of firearms, ammunition and explosives, by:
* consulting with the two governments, the participants in the ongoing negotiations in Northern Ireland, and paramilitary and other relevant groups,
* devising and presenting to the governments a set of proposals on how to achieve decommissioning,
* facilitating the process by observing, monitoring and verifying decommissioning, and receiving and auditing arms, and
* reporting periodically on progress.

In the Good Friday Agreement, signed in 1998, the participants reaffirmed their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations, and confirmed their intention to continue to work constructively and in good faith with the Independent Commission, and to use any influence they may have, to achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two years following endorsement in referendums North and South of the agreement and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement.

In the event, progress on decommissioning was disappointingly slow, and the two-year target was not met. Decommissioning of Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) weaponry was often used as a necessary condition before Unionists would agree to the full implementation of the Agreement including power sharing. Negotiations between Republican representatives and the IICD were carried out eventually and these arms were put beyond use. Decommissioning of Loyalist arms started later but were also successfully concluded in 2010. See: The Final Report of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, 4 July 2011, which provides a summary history of the group and a statement of &quot;lessons Learned&quot; from the decommissioning process.

==Decommissioning of Republican paramilitary weaponry==
In 2000, Martti Ahtisaari, former President of Finland, and Cyril Ramaphosa, South African political and business leader, were appointed to inspect IRA weapons dumps. They submitted three reports over the next year.

===PIRA weaponry===
On 26 September 2005, the commission published its fourth and final report on acts of Provisional IRA (IRA) decommissioning. The decommissioning process has taken place using estimates of PIRA weaponry submitted by the British and Irish Governments. General John de Chastelain and his colleagues reported that they were &quot;...satisfied that the arms decommissioned represent the totality of the IRA&#x27;s arsenal&quot;. This was confirmed by two witnesses independent of the commission, Catholic priest Father Alec Reid, and former president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Reverend Harold Good.

Among the weaponry estimated (by &quot;Jane&#x27;s Intelligence Review&quot;) to have been destroyed as part of this entire process were:

*1,000 rifles,
*3 tonnes of Semtex,
*20–30 heavy machine guns,
*7 surface-to-air missiles (unused),
*7 flame throwers,
*1,200 detonators,
*20 rocket-propelled grenade launchers,
*100 handguns, and
*100+ grenades.

There had been three previous acts of decommissioning by the PIRA which were also overseen by the commission. The first act was in October 2001, the second in April 2002, the third in October 2003 and the fourth and final in September 2005. In the fourth and final act of decommissioning, General de Chastelain reported that he had seen rifles, particularly AK-47s, machine guns, surface-to-air missiles, explosives, explosive material, mortars, flame throwers, hand guns, timer units and blasting caps, and some weaponry that was &quot;very old&quot;, including a WWII Bren light machine gun.

The panel stated to the press:
&quot;We have observed and verified events to put beyond use very large quantities of arms which we believe include all the arms in the IRA&#x27;s possession... Our new inventory is consistent with these estimates. We are satisfied that the arms decommissioning represents the totality of the IRA&#x27;s arsenal.&quot;
and while they could not report on the quantity or types of weapons destroyed the witnesses said:&quot;The experience of seeing this with our own eyes, on a minute-to-minute basis, provided us with evidence so clear and of its nature so incontrovertible that at the end of the process [PIRA weapon decommissioning] it demonstrated to us – and would have demonstrated to anyone who might have been with us – that beyond any shadow of doubt, the arms of the IRA have now been decommissioned.&quot;

The 10th (latest as of May 2006) report from the IMC stated that it believes that the PIRA completed the process of decommissioning all the weapons &quot;under its control&quot; during the final act of decommissioning in 2005.

===Other republican weaponry===
In February 2010, days before the IICD was due to disband, both the Irish National Liberation Army and the Official Irish Republican Army announced that they had decommissioned their weapons.

==Decommissioning of Loyalist paramilitary weaponry==
The Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) decommissioned small arms and ammunition in December 1998. The three main loyalist paramilitary groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), Red Hand Commando (RHC) and the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), retained their weapons for a longer period during which their members were said by the Independent Monitoring Commission to still be engaged in criminal activities. On 12 February 2006, &quot;The Observer&quot; reported that the UVF had refused to decommission its weapons; the UVF formally decommissioned their weapons in June 2009. The UDA was confirmed to have decommissioned its weapons on 6 January 2010. The UDA&#x27;s decommissioning was confirmed by General de Chastelain, Lord Eames, the former archbishop of Armagh and Sir George Quigley, a former top civil servant. De Chastelain stated that the decommissioning included arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices and the UDA stated that the arms &quot;constitute the totality of those under their control&quot;. The dissident UDA South East Antrim Brigade completed decommissioning by February 2010.

In the study of the evolution of English, West Frisian is notable as being the most closely related foreign tongue to the various dialects of Old English spoken across the Heptarchy, these being part of the Anglo-Frisian branch of the West Germanic family.

== Name ==
The name &quot;West Frisian&quot; is only used outside the Netherlands, to distinguish this language from the closely related Frisian languages of East Frisian, including Saterland Frisian, and North Frisian spoken in Germany. Within the Netherlands, however, &quot;West Frisian&quot; refers to the West Frisian dialect of the Dutch language while the West Frisian language is almost always just called &quot;Frisian&quot; (in Dutch: for the Frisian language and for the Dutch dialect). The unambiguous name used for the West Frisian language by linguists in the Netherlands is (West Lauwers Frisian), the Lauwers being a border river that separates the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen.

==History==

===Old Frisian===
In the early Middle Ages the Frisian lands stretched from the area around Bruges, in what is now Belgium, to the river Weser, in northern Germany. At that time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. Today this region is sometimes referred to as &quot;Greater Frisia&quot; or , and many of the areas within it still treasure their Frisian heritage, even though in most places the Frisian language has been lost.

Old Frisian bore a striking similarity to Old English. This similarity was reinforced in the late Middle Ages by the Ingvaeonic sound shift, which affected Frisian and English, but the other West Germanic varieties hardly at all. Both English and Frisian are marked by the suppression of the Germanic nasal in a word like &quot;us&quot; (), &quot;soft&quot; () or &quot;goose&quot; (): see Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law. Also, when followed by some vowels, the Germanic &quot;k&quot; developed into a &quot;ch&quot; sound. For example, the West Frisian for &quot;cheese&quot; and &quot;church&quot; is and , whereas in Dutch they are and . Modern English and Frisian on the other hand have become very divergent, largely due to wholesale Old Norse and Anglo-Norman imports into English and similarly heavy Dutch and Low German influences on Frisian.

One major difference between Old Frisian and modern Frisian is that in the Old Frisian period ( – ) grammatical cases still occurred. Some of the texts that are preserved from this period are from the 12th or 13th, but most are from the 14th and 15th centuries. Generally, these texts are restricted to legal documents. Although the earliest definite written examples of Frisian are from approximately the 9th century, there are a few runic inscriptions from the region which are probably older and possibly in the Frisian language. These runic writings, however, usually do not amount to more than single- or few-word inscriptions, and cannot be said to constitute literature as such. The Middle Frisian language period ( – ) is rooted in geopolitics and the consequent fairly abrupt halt in the use of Frisian as a written language.

===Middle Frisian and New Frisian===
Until the 16th century, West Frisian was widely spoken and written, but from 1500 onwards it became an almost exclusively oral language, mainly used in rural areas. This was in part due to the occupation of its stronghold, the Dutch province of Friesland (), in 1498, by Albert III, Duke of Saxony, who replaced West Frisian as the language of government with Dutch.

This practice was continued under the Habsburg rulers of the Netherlands (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and his son Philip II, King of Spain). When the Netherlands became independent in 1585, West Frisian did not regain its former status, because Holland rose as the dominant part of the Netherlands and its language, Dutch, as the dominant language in judicial, administrative and religious affairs.

In this period the Frisian poet Gysbert Japiks (1603–1666), a schoolteacher and cantor from the city of Bolsward (), who largely fathered modern West Frisian literature and orthography, was an exception to the rule.

His example was not followed until the 19th century, when entire generations of Frisian authors and poets appeared. This coincided with the introduction of the so-called newer breaking system, a prominent grammatical feature in almost all West Frisian dialects, with the notable exception of . Therefore, the New Frisian period is considered to have begun at this time, around 1820.

== Speakers ==

Most speakers of West Frisian live in the province of Friesland in the north of the Netherlands. Friesland has 643,000 inhabitants (2005), of whom 94% can understand spoken West Frisian, 74% can speak West Frisian, 75% can read West Frisian, and 27% can write it.

For over half of the inhabitants of the province of Friesland, 55% (), West Frisian is the native language. In the central east, West Frisian speakers spill over the province border, with some 4,000–6,000 of them actually living in the province of Groningen, in the triangular area of the villages Marum (West Frisian: ), De Wilp (), and Opende ().

Also, many West Frisians have left their province in the last 60 years for more prosperous parts of the Netherlands. Therefore, possibly as many as 150,000 West Frisian speakers live in other Dutch provinces, particularly in the urban agglomeration in the West, and in neighbouring Groningen and newly reclaimed Flevoland.

A Frisian diaspora exists abroad; Friesland sent more emigrants than any other Dutch province between the Second World War and the 1970s. Frisian is still spoken by some Dutch Canadians, Dutch Americans, Dutch Australians and Dutch New Zealanders.

Apart from the use of West Frisian as a first language, it is also spoken as a second language by about 120,000 people in the province of Friesland.

West Frisian is considered by UNESCO to be a language in danger of becoming extinct, officially listed as &quot;vulnerable&quot;.

== Status ==
In 1951, Frisian language activists, protesting at the exclusive use of Dutch in the courts, caused a riot in Leeuwarden. The resulting inquiry led to the establishment of a committee of inquiry. This committee recommended that the Frisian language should receive legal status as a minority language. Subsequently, the Use of Frisian in Legal Transactions Act of 11 May 1956 was passed, which provided for the use of Frisian in transactions with the courts.

Since 1956, West Frisian has an official status along with and equal to Dutch in the province of Friesland. It is used in many domains of Frisian society, among which are education, legislation, and administration. In 2010, some sixty public transportation ticket machines in Friesland and Groningen added a West Frisian-language option.

Although in the courts of law the Dutch language is still mainly used, in the province of Friesland, Frisians have the right to give evidence in their own language. Also, they can take the oath in Frisian in courts anywhere in the Netherlands.

Primary education in Friesland was made bilingual in 1956, which means West Frisian can be used as a teaching medium. In the same year, West Frisian became an official school subject, having been introduced to primary education as an optional extra in 1937. It was not until 1980, however, that West Frisian had the status of a required subject in primary schools, and not until 1993 that it was given the same position in secondary education.

In 1997, the province of Friesland officially changed its name from the Dutch form to the West Frisian . So far 4 out of 18 municipalities (, , , ) have changed their official geographical names from Dutch to West Frisian. Some other municipalities, like Heerenveen and the 11 towns, use two names (both Dutch and West Frisian) or only a West Frisian name.

Within ISO 639 West Frisian falls under the codes codice_1 and codice_2, which were assigned to the collective Frisian languages.

==Relations with Dutch and English==
===With Dutch===
The mutual intelligibility in reading between Dutch and Frisian is poor. A cloze test in 2005 revealed native Dutch speakers understood 31.9% of a West Frisian newspaper, 66.4% of an Afrikaans newspaper and 97.1% of a Dutch newspaper. However, the same test also revealed that native Dutch speakers understood 63.9% of a spoken Frisian text, 59.4% of a spoken Afrikaans text and 89.4% of a spoken Dutch text, read aloud by native speakers of the respective languages.

===Folklore about relation to English===
The saying &quot;As milk is to cheese, are English and Fries&quot; describes the observed similarity between Frisian and English. One rhyme that is sometimes used to demonstrate the palpable similarity between Frisian and English is &quot;Bread, butter and green cheese is good English and good Fries&quot;, which does not sound very different from &quot;.

Another rhyme on this theme, &quot; (; in English, &quot;Butter, bread and green cheese, whoever can&#x27;t say that is not a proper Frisian&quot;) was used, according to legend, by the 16th century Frisian rebel and pirate Pier Gerlofs Donia as a shibboleth that he forced his captives to repeat to distinguish Frisians from Dutch and Low Germans.

== Language examples ==

Here is a short example of the West Frisian language in comparison with English, Old English, and Dutch.

== Internal classification ==
Not all Frisian varieties spoken in Dutch Friesland are mutually intelligible. The varieties on the islands are rather divergent, and &quot;Glottolog&quot; distinguishes four languages:
* Hindeloopen-Molkwerum Frisian
* Schiermonnikoog Frisian
* Westlauwers–Terschellings
** Terschelling Frisian
** Western Frisian (mainstream Mainland West Frisian)

The dialects within mainstream mainland West Frisian are all readily intelligible. Three are usually distinguished:
* Clay Frisian (Klaaifrysk dialect)
* Wood Frisian (Wâldfrysk dialect, incl. Westereendersk)
* South or Southwest Frisian (Súdhoeksk dialect)

The (&quot;South Western&quot;) dialect, which is spoken in an area called (&quot;the Southwest Corner&quot;), deviates from mainstream West Frisian in that it does not adhere to the so-called newer breaking system, a prominent grammatical feature in the three other main dialects.

The (&quot;Northern&quot;) dialect, spoken in the north eastern corner of the province, does not differ much from Wood Frisian.

By far the two most-widely spoken West Frisian dialects are Clay Frisian () and Wood Frisian (). Both these names are derived from the Frisian landscape. In the western and north-western parts of the province, the region where Clay Frisian is spoken, the soil is made up of thick marine clay, hence the name. While in the Clay Frisian-speaking area ditches are used to separate the pastures, in the eastern part of the province, where the soil is sandy, and water sinks away much faster, rows of trees are used to that purpose. The natural landscape in which Wâldfrysk exists mirrors The Weald and North Weald areas of south-eastern England – the Germanic words &quot;wald&quot; and &quot;weald&quot; are cognate.

Although and are mutually very easily intelligible, there are, at least to native West Frisian speakers, a few very conspicuous differences. These include the pronunciation of the words (&quot;me&quot;), (&quot;thee&quot;), (&quot;he&quot;), (&quot;she&quot; or &quot;they&quot;), (&quot;we&quot;) and (&quot;by&quot;), and the diphthongs and .

Of the two, probably has more speakers, but because the western clay area was originally the more prosperous part of the mostly agricultural province, has had the larger influence on the West Frisian standardised language.

===Dialectal comparison===
There are few if any differences in morphology or syntax among the West Frisian dialects, all of which are easily mutually intelligible, but there are slight variances in lexicon.

====Phonological differences====

The largest difference between the Clay Frisian and Wood Frisian dialects are the words (&quot;me&quot;), (&quot;you&quot;), (&quot;he&quot;), (&quot;she&quot; or &quot;they&quot;), (&quot;we&quot;), and (&quot;by&quot;), which are pronounced in the Wood Frisian as &quot;mi&quot;, &quot;di&quot;, &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;si&quot;, &quot;wi&quot;, and &quot;bi&quot; and in Clay Frisian as &quot;mij&quot;, &quot;dij&quot;, &quot;hij&quot;, &quot;sij&quot;, &quot;wij&quot;, and &quot;bij&quot;. Other differences are in the pronunciation of the diphthongs , , and which are pronounced &quot;ij&quot;, &quot;ai&quot;, and &quot;aai&quot; in Wood Frisian, but &quot;ôi&quot;, &quot;òi&quot;, and &quot;ôi&quot; in Clay Frisian. Thus, in Wood Frisian, there is no difference between and , whereas in Clay Frisian, there is no difference between and .

Other phonological differences include:

====Lexical differences====
Some lexical differences between Clay Frisian and Wood Frisian include:

==Orthography==
West Frisian uses the Latin alphabet. A, E, O and U may be accompanied by circumflex or acute accents.

In alphabetical listings both I and Y are usually found between H and J. When two words differ only because one has I and the other one has Y (such as and ), the word with I precedes the one with Y.

In handwriting, IJ (used for Dutch loanwords and personal names) is written as a single letter (see IJ (digraph)), whereas in print the string IJ is used. In alphabetical listings IJ is most commonly considered to consist of the two letters I and J, although in dictionaries there is an entry IJ between X and Z telling the user to browse back to I.

<doc id="547303" wikidata="Q372083" url="?curid=547303" title="Gunbound">
<text>Gunbound (stylized as GunBound; &quot;Geonbaundeu&quot;) is a free-to-play, multiplayer, turn-based artillery game developed by South Korean developer Softnyx. It has been compared to the &quot;Worms&quot; series as it shares many common gameplay features.

The original version was released in South Korea in May 2002 before being released worldwide in August 2003. A spin-off mobile game titled &quot;GunboundM&quot; was released in July 2017. A sequel titled &quot;New Gunbound&quot; was announced for mobile in September 2019 and for the PC in May 2020. The PC version was scheduled for release on Steam in July 2020. However, it remained unreleased and was removed from Steam in February, 2021. Meanwhile, during the Brasil Game Show 2024, Gravity Game Hub (GGH) and Softnyx announced their plans to relaunch Gunbound in Southeast Asia and Latin America, and prior to the game&#x27;s return in these regions, a pre-registration event and beta tests were conducted.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Gunbound&quot; has turn-based artillery gameplay, bearing properties of two-dimensional games and ballistics-simulation games. In Gunbound, players are assigned to two opposing teams which take turns firing at each other with vehicles called &quot;Mobiles&quot; in Gunbound parlance. Each Mobile has three unique weapons, labeled &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, and &quot;SS&quot; &quot;(Special Shot)&quot;.

Factors like terrain condition, wind currents and elemental phenomena force players to continuously change their aim and trajectory power setting while rethinking their strategy at the same time. Gunbound also implements a &quot;delay&quot; turn system which is influenced by the Mobile, the weapon and/or item a player uses—using items or taking time with actions results in a longer wait before the player&#x27;s next turn.

Before the start of every game, the room master has the option to disable certain items from being used during that game. All or none of the items could be disabled. Items either take up one or two slots, and each player is allowed to acquire any combination of items as long as they fit in six slots. Generally, strong items take up two slots, while weak items take up one slot. There are currently four different types of items available. They are attack items, defensive items, weather item, and other items.

===Avatars===
A user&#x27;s character can be equipped with clothing and other items, termed avatar Items, which provide additional statistical bonuses that will assist players in the game, except on specific servers where avatar bonuses are disabled. This adds an element of customization for players. Gold (the game&#x27;s currency) earned from battles can be spent on these Avatar items. Avatars can also be bought using cash which can be bought using money from a credit card or cash using PayPal or mail (Gcoins). Most common avatars can be bought by gold, and very strong avatars by G Coin, but some can be bought with both.

In Gunbound International, avatars can be leveled up by enchanting, and this can only be done with Cash. The maximum level is currently 20. Each level boosts significant stats to the avatar.

===Mobiles===
The game has twenty Mobiles in total. Every Mobile falls under one of three different defense categories: Mechanical, Shielded, and Bionic, and one of four different attack categories: Laser, Explosion, Impact, and Electrical.

Different mobiles have different defenses, attack and health levels, delay, angle ranges, bunge (land damage) ability, and moving ability. The 24 Mobiles are Armor Mobile, Mage, Nak, Lightning, JD, A. Sate, Tiburon, J. Frog, Kalsiddon, Trico, Bigfoot, Boomer, Ice, Turtle, Grub, Raon Launcher, Aduka, Maya, Wolf, Phoenix, Blue Whale, Frank, Dragon, and Knight. Choosing Random (which randomly picks a bot) is the only way to obtain the Dragon, Knight, or Phoenix (if you aren&#x27;t a Power User, Cash is used to pay for this EX Item) mobiles; the other bots can be chosen at any time prior to a battle. In the Gunbound Revolution version, Maya is bought in the Cash store. In June 2010, 4 new mobiles were introduced in Gunbound International. They are Shadower Walker, Princess, Assassin and Carrior. They&#x27;re named by regular players.

To note that some of the mobiles weren’t present during the initial release of the game. Those were only added on future updates. The list below details in which phase each mobile was added:

;Thor’s Hammer
A.Sate, Aduka, Armor Mobile, Big Foot, Boomer Laucher, Dragon, Grub, Ice, JD, Knight, Lighting, Mage, Nak Machine, Raon Launcher, Trico, Turtle;

;World Champion
J.Frog, Kalsiddon;

;Season 2
Blue Whale, Frank, Maya, Phoenix, Tiburon, Wolf;

;Season 3
Assassin, Carrior, Princess, Shadow Walker.

===Game modes===

;Solo
Each player has only one life during game play. Once dead, the deceased players access a three-in-a-row, rolling slots game in which they can gain gold, alter wind conditions (affecting the shots of still-living players), or drop randomly chosen items or bombs from the sky.

;Tag
&quot;Tag&quot; mode is similar to &quot;Solo&quot; mode with only one difference: Players are allowed two Mobiles at the beginning of a match. In this mode, players are permitted to switch once per turn between their chosen primary and secondary Mobiles, each with its own health value (Initially, secondary Mobiles only have half of its total health. This, however, can be mended using Healing items). Players cannot switch Mobiles once dead.

;Score
In &quot;Score&quot; mode, the objective is to kill or bunge opponents until the enemy life counter reaches zero. Bunging is destroying the land around an opponent&#x27;s area, causing the opponent to fall. The lives allotted in &quot;Score&quot; mode relies on the number of team players participating in a match. For a team composed of &quot;n&quot; players, there are (&quot;n&quot; + 1) lives. Lives are pooled between players in a team. A team wins if the opposition&#x27;s life counter reaches zero, or if there are no more opponents left on the field. Dead players, upon dying, have a choice of their drop location and drop at that point in the field in a set number of four turns after the point is chosen. Should a player not hit land, he or she will continue to fall and the team life counter will not go down, but instead cause the player to reselect the drop location and wait another four turns. The player&#x27;s drop location is slightly affected by wind conditions.

;Jewel
Participants are required to eliminate targets called &quot;Jewel&quot; (seen in the form of Raons). Each &quot;Jewel&quot; is assigned a point value for being destroyed. Point values include -5, 5, 10 and 25. Shots fired at the enemy will not cause damage, but can destroy land. Teams win the game by rounding up at least 100 points, or bunging (hitting the land underneath them until they drop down) their opponents until none are left.

;Powerball
Same as Score mode, except that only the &#x27;teleport&#x27; item is available. Instead, Powerballs representing the various items drop from the sky. Collecting the Powerball grants the corresponding item&#x27;s ability. Different effects can be stacked. There are five Powerballs: Thunder Ball, Dual Ball, Gold Ball, Force Ball and Bomb Ball. The Thunder Ball will cause thunder to strike where the bullet lands when it is shot as if it went through a thunder storm in other circumstances. The Dual Ball acts as if the player had used a Dual item but does not affect delay. The Gold Ball increases the gold earned from completing certain feats. The Force Ball increases the damage done when hitting another player. The Bomb Ball is the only non-beneficial Power Ball and deals 100 damage to whoever it hits. The damage can stack when multiple Bomb Balls hit a player.
Each player is allowed to have up to 4 bombs stacked at a time.

== Development ==
&quot;Gunbound&quot; was developed and is maintained by South Korean developer Softnyx. Its first major release was in 2002 as an open beta software and was subtitled &quot;Thor&#x27;s Hammer&quot;. In 2006, a World Championships was held and the game&#x27;s subtitle changed to &quot;World Champion&quot;. In subsequent major releases, the game was subtitled by seasons and it is in &quot;Season 3&quot;.

Between 2003 and 2007, &quot;Gunbound&quot; was localized and launched in various parts of the world, such as in Thailand, Brazil, Japan and Europe. It was also released in North America as &quot;Gunbound Revolution&quot; by online game portal ijji. However, the North American servers were shut down on July 24, 2009.

===&quot;GunboundM&quot;===

In July 2017, a free-to-play mobile version of &quot;Gunbound&quot; titled &quot;GunboundM&quot; was released on Google Play and the App Store (iOS). It was developed by DargomStudio in partnership with Softnyx, and features gameplay similar the original &quot;Gunbound&quot; but with modified features such as a visible bullet path for players to aim their shots, a training mode against AI-controlled opponents, and in-built microtransactions. On December 13, 2021, GunboundM was released on Steam as a free-to-play game also with microtransactions.

===&quot;New Gunbound&quot;===
In September 2019, &quot;New Gunbound&quot; was announced as a new mobile game developed in partnership with Thailand publisher Electronics Extreme, which would be released in 10 countries within Southeast Asia. A closed beta took place in 2020 between January 15 and January 22.

In May 2020, a desktop version of &quot;New Gunbound&quot; was announced and released in Latin America. A version developed by Rocket Punch Games was announced to be released on Steam in July 2020. However, it was never released and was removed from Steam in February, 2021.

==Reception==

The UK edition of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; magazine gave &quot;Gunbound&quot; a rating of 83 out of 100.

<text>Fissidens adianthoides, the maidenhair pocketmoss, is a North American moss in the family Fissidentaceae. It was first described by Johann Hedwig in 1801. The Nitinaht First Nations of Vancouver Island have used maidenhair moss to bandage wounds. It was named by the Anglo-Saxons based on its resemblance to pubic hair.

== Description ==
The plant itself is about 85 x 5mm. It is dioicous. Dioicous is defined as a plant having the male (antheridia) and female (archegonia) reproductive organs in separate individuals. An archegonium is a multicellular reproductive organ that produces female gametes. The antheridium is the male structure that holds, creates and releases sperm. It is a very robust plant and forms dark green to brown-green turfs.

=== Gametophyte ===
==== Stem ====
The stem is extremely branched. &quot;Fissidens adianthoides&quot; have a central strand. The central strand contains thin-walled cells called hydroids that conduct water and sterids which provide structural support. 

==== Leaf ====
There are about 60 pairs of leaves that are slightly undulate (wavy) in texture. The shape is oblong to lanceolate (narrow oval) and tapered to an acute point. Sometimes the leaf can be obtuse in shape. The lamina also known as the leaf blade, is round and then narrows towards the apex. The leaf margin is crenulate (finely scalloped) to regular serrulate (sawlike). The marginal cells are often thinner with thicker cell walls. There are about 2-3 cells in the costa. The leaf cells are very turgid and irregularly round-like hexagons. These leaf cells are unistratose which means they are single layered. They are also smooth and firm-walled.

=== Reproductive structures ===
==== Perigonium ====
The perigonium is the reproductive structure which holds the male organs. It is made up of an antheridia, paraphyses and perigonial leaves. Paraphyses are upright sterile filament-like structures that support the reproductive apparatus of bryophytes. 

==== Perichaetium ====
The perichaetium is reproductive structure which holds the female organs. It is made up of an archegonia, paraphyses, and perichaetial leaves. The perichaetium is located on short axillary branches.

=== Sporophyte ===
A sporophyte is the diploid multicellular stage in the life cycle of a moss which produces spores. They are commonly observed in this species. There is one sporophyte produced per perichaetium. The seta, which is a stalk that supports capsule, is relatively short and is 25 mm in length. It is red-brown in colour and inserted laterally. The operculum (lid) is about the same length as the rest of the sporangium. The capsule of the sporophyte is inclined, curved, bilaterally symmetric and about 1.5 mm. As for the calyptra, it is cucullate, smooth and about 2.5 mm. The spores are about 3-22 μm.

Since it is a member of the Bryopsida class it also has arthrodontous peristome teeth which aid in spore dispersal. &quot;Fissidens adianthoides&quot; have 16 red teeth. Arthrodontous teeth are made up of cell wall fragments. They are also hygroscopic, meaning they move according to changes in humidity. They are about 85–120 μm wide at the base of the teeth and the upper part of the teeth are finely papillose. 

== Taxonomy ==
=== Closely related species ===
&quot;Fissidens adianthoides&quot; is often confused with many similar species such as &quot;F. osmundioides&quot;. They both have similar laminal cells. Also they have a serrate leaf apex. The only feature that differentiates the two is that &quot;F. osmundioides&quot;has terminal perichaetia and rhizoids papillose in nature.

Another species that it often gets confused with is &quot;Fissidens dubius&quot;. They both have short perichaetial stems in the top of the proximal leaves and a lighter marginal laminal cell band. The difference between the two is that &quot;F. adianthoides&quot; is a lot tinier and have more obscure laminal cells that are usually double stratose and irregular. According to molecular studies by L.E. Anderson and V. S. Bryan (1956), they are not closely related.

&quot;F. serrulatus&quot; is a very similar species as well. However, it has longer leaves and grows on damp soil or gravel nearby very shady streams.

The features that distinguish &quot;Fissidens adianthoides&quot; from other similar species are by its &quot;unistratose, smooth laminal cells, a lighter band of marginal laminal cells, and its short perichaetial stems.&quot; Other distinguishing features are the pronounced teeth on the leaf margins and the tendency for this species to be soft with leaf points that curl downward when dry.

=== Family Fissidentaceae ===
Fissidentaceae is a morphologically homogeneous group that is defined by its distinct leaf structure. The leaf is made of two laminae; a dorsal lamina and an apical lamina. They are also arranged in double vertical rows on the stem in the same plane and attachment.

A molecular phylogenetic study states that the families Fissidentaceae and Dicranaceae are closely related.

=== Genus &quot;Fissidens&quot; ===

Fissidentaceae is an acrocarpous family that is made up of haplolepideous mosses and consists of one genus called &quot;Fissidens&quot;. &quot;Fissidens&quot; comprises about 440 species. However, this genus is rather poorly studied phylogenetically compared to other mosses in Bryophyta. Most of the species can be found in humid, warm and tropical areas of the globe and the number of species decreases proportionally to the decrease in latitude.

The peristome teeth of &quot;Fissidens&quot; are morphologically identical to the members of the family Dicranaceae.

In the study, &quot;Molecular phylogeny of the genus &quot;Fissidens&quot; (Fissidentaceae, Bryophyta) and a refinement of the infrageneric classification&quot;, they have constructed a phylogenetic tree of 50 &quot;Fissidens&quot; species using DNA sequence of the rbcL and rps4 gene. It was based on the ancestral similarities between the peristomal teeth, limbidium and chromosome number. Based on their findings, three subgenera were created: &quot;Pachyfissidens&quot;, &quot;Neoamblyothallia&quot;, and &quot;Fissidens&quot;. The subgenus &quot;Fissidens&quot; was made up of five sections: &quot;Fissidens, Polypodiopsis, Aloma, Areofissidens,&quot; and &quot;Semilimbidium.&quot;

== Distribution and habitat ==
=== Distribution ===
Worldwide distribution: It is vastly distributed in the forests of the Northern Hemisphere, extending from the arctic, alpine and prairie regions, often in more sheltered locations. It is widely distributed across North America.

National and state/provincial distribution of &quot;Fissidens adianthoides&quot; is as follows:

Canada: AB, BC, LB, NB, NF, NS, NT, NU, ON, QC, SK, YT

United States:  AK, AL, AR, CA, CT, DE, FL, GA, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, NJ, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, TN, TX, VA, VT, WA, WI, WV, WY

=== Habitat ===
It is found in shady sites such as nearby moving water, near waterfalls, soil, open fields of grass, around the forest floor, decaying wood, on dripping limestone and stone rocks. This moss can be commonly found on damp or wet soil and peat. It is scarcely found on decaying wood.

== Life cycle ==

&quot;Fissidens adianthoides&quot; has sporic meiosis as well as asexual reproduction. Sporic meiosis is the alternation of heteromorphic generations and is characterized by each phase having a different free-living phase: one is the gametophyte which is usually haploid while the other is a sporophyte which is often diploid. Additionally, sporic meiosis is a type of life cycle where meiosis results in spores not gametes. The haploid gametophyte makes gametes from mitosis and the two gametes combine to form a zygote (2n), which then develops into a sporophyte. The sporophyte creates spores via meiosis which are haploid and then develops into the gametophyte.

There are two forms of asexual reproduction in this species. The first is fragmentation where the bryophyte is broken into completely separate pieces and grows to become a new individual from the parent plant. The second method is regeneration from caducous organs. This is when the organs of the plant such as leaves, shoots, leaf apices, and branches detach from the parent shoot. As a result, the moss is able to regenerate from these detached areas and continues to survive.

== Uses ==
&quot;F. adianthoides&quot; was used in the past for bandaging wounds. It was noted that the First Natives of Nitinaht in Vancouver Island, Canada used this moss as well.

The genus &quot;Fissidens&quot; was used in several Asian countries like Bolivia as an antibacterial remedy for sore throats or other bacterial infections. Other usages included burning &quot;Fissidens&quot; to promote hair growth in China.

Currently, however, it serves no important economic or commercial usage.

==Response to herbicide==
In a study of the effect of the herbicide Asulam on moss growth, &quot;Fissidens adianthoides&quot; was shown to have intermediate sensitivity to Asulam exposure.

== Conservation ==
Its Nature Serve conservation status is G5 which means its secure.

<text>The New American Standard Bible (NASB, also simply NAS for &quot;New American Standard&quot;) is a translation of the Bible in contemporary English. Published by the Lockman Foundation, the complete NASB was released in 1971. New revisions were published in 1995 and 2020. The NASB relies on recently published critical editions of the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. It is known for preferring a literal translation style that generally preserves the structure of the original language when possible (formal equivalence), rather than an idiomatic style that attempts to match natural English usage.

== Translation philosophy ==
The New American Standard Bible is considered by some sources as the most literally translated of major 20th-century English Bible translations.

The NASB is an original translation from the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. It is an update of the American Standard Version (ASV) of 1901, which itself was a revision of the 1885 Revised Version (RV), which updated the King James Version (KJV). The goal of the translation was to incorporate Hebrew and Greek texts discovered since 1901, as well as render a translation in more current English than the ASV and KJV. The main alternative at the time was the Revised Standard Version (1946–1952/1971), but it was considered overly theologically liberal in parts. 

The Hebrew text used for this translation was the 3rd edition of Rudolf Kittel&#x27;s &quot;Biblia Hebraica&quot; as well as the Dead Sea Scrolls. The &quot;Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia&quot; was consulted for the 1995 revision. For the Greek text, Eberhard Nestle and Kurt Aland&#x27;s &quot;Novum Testamentum Graece&quot; was used; the 23rd edition in the 1971 original, and the 26th in the 1995 revision.

Desiring to create a literal, modern translation of the Bible into English, the translators sought to produce a contemporary English Bible while maintaining a formal equivalence translation style. There remain cases where word-for-word literalness was determined to be unacceptable or impossible, and there, changes were made in the direction of more current idioms. In some such instances, the more literal renderings were indicated in footnotes.

=== YHWH ===
One notable area where the NASB differs from the ASV is in how to render the Tetragrammaton, YHWH. The ASV rendered it as &quot;Jehovah&quot;. The ASV translators defended the decision by calling the avoidance of the Divine Name a &quot;Jewish superstition&quot;. Most later translations, including the NASB, have generally not agreed with it, and the NASB renders it as LORD or GOD in capital letters. The committee stated the reason as:

== Revisions ==
The Lockman Foundation published NASB text, modifications, and revisions in the following order:
* Gospel of John (1960)
* The Gospels (1962)
* New Testament (1963)
* Psalms (1968)
* Complete Bible (Old Testament and New Testament; 1971)
* Minor text modifications (1972, 1973, 1975)
* Major text revisions (1977, 1995, 2020)

=== 1995 revision ===
In 1992, the Lockman Foundation commissioned a limited revision of the NASB. In 1995, the Lockman Foundation reissued the NASB text as the &quot;NASB Updated Edition&quot; (more commonly, the &quot;Updated NASB&quot; or &quot;NASB95&quot;). Since then, it has become widely known as simply the &quot;NASB&quot;, supplanting the 1977 text in current printings, save for a few (Thompson Chain Reference Bibles, Open Bibles, Key Word Study Bibles, et al.).

In the updated NASB, consideration was given to the latest available manuscripts with an emphasis on determining the best Greek text. Primarily, the 26th edition of Nestle-Aland&#x27;s &quot;Novum Testamentum Graece&quot; is closely followed. The &quot;Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia&quot; is also employed together with the most recent information from lexicography, cognate languages, and the Dead Sea Scrolls.

The updated NASB represents recommended revisions and refinements, and states that it incorporates thorough research based on current English usage. Vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structure were meticulously revised for greater understanding and smoother reading, hence increasing clarity and readability. Terms found in Elizabethan English such as &quot;thy&quot; and &quot;thou&quot; have been modernized, while verses with difficult word ordering are restructured. Punctuation and paragraphing have been formatted for modernization, and verbs with multiple meanings have been updated to better account for their contextual usage.

=== 2020 revision ===
Starting in 2018, the Lockman Foundation posted some passages from &quot;NASB 2020&quot;, an update of the 1995 revision. Key differences from the 1995 revision include an effort to improve &quot;gender accuracy&quot; (for example, adding &quot;or sisters&quot; in italics to passages that reference &quot;brothers&quot;, to help convey the mixed-gender meaning of a passage that might otherwise be misunderstood as only speaking of men), a shift (where applicable) from the common construct &quot;let us&quot; when proposing action to the more-contemporary construct &quot;let&#x27;s&quot; (to disambiguate a sort of &quot;imperative&quot; encouragement rather than a seeking of permission that could otherwise be misunderstood from a given passage), and a repositioning of some &quot;bracketed text&quot; (that is, verses or portions of verses that are not present in earliest Biblical manuscripts, and thus printed in brackets in previous NASB editions) out from inline-and-in-brackets down instead to footnotes.

== Translators ==
The translation work was done by a group sponsored by the Lockman Foundation. According to the Lockman Foundation, the committee consisted of people from Christian educational institutions of higher learning and from Evangelical Protestant, predominantly conservative, denominations (Presbyterian, Methodist, Southern Baptist, Church of Christ, Nazarene, American Baptist, Fundamentalist, Conservative Baptist, Free Methodist, Congregational, Disciples of Christ, Evangelical Free, Independent Baptist, Independent Mennonite, Assembly of God, North American Baptist, and &quot;other religious groups&quot;).

The Lockman Foundation&#x27;s website indicates that among the translators and consultants who contributed are Biblical scholars with doctorates in Biblical languages, Christian theology, &quot;or other advanced degrees&quot;, and come from a variety of denominational backgrounds. More than 20 individuals worked on modernizing the NASB in accord with the most recent research.

*The writers and journalists Francisco Bulnes (1847–1924) and Emilio Rabasa (1856–1930), co-founders of the newspaper (in 1888), both considered spokesmen for the Científicos.
*Enrique Creel (1854–1931), a wealthy businessman and landowner, an influential member of the powerful Creel-Terrazas Family that dominated the northern state of Chihuahua, of which he was governor from 1904 until the fall of the Díaz regime in 1911.
*Luis Terrazas (1829–1923), Founder of the Creel-Terrazas Family, father-in-law of Enrique Creel, and one of the richest landowners in the Republic of Mexico; he helped to bankroll the faction.
*The lawyers and Joaquín Casasús.

<text>The Saab Catherina is a 1964 prototype automobile, commissioned by the Swedish automaker Saab, designed by Sixten Sason and made at the workshops of the &quot;Aktiebolaget Svenska Järnvägsverkstäderna&quot; (ASJ - the Swedish Railroad Works) in Katrineholm, Sweden (hence the name). It is a red, two-seat sports car with a targa top.

Sason, who was working as a freelancer for Saab, made some drawings of a small sports coupé in the early 1960s. As Saab was planning to introduce a sports car model, the company commissioned him to adopt the design for mass production. The project began in January 1963 and in May the assembly of the prototype started at the ASJ. The prototype was first displayed, however, only on 24 April 1965, at the Linköping Sports Centre.

For economy reasons, the Catherina utilised many components of the contemporary Saab 96 and shared the same wheelbase, which was longer than the finally accepted design. Its unique feature was its targa top, which could be stowed in the luggage compartment of the car. Stemming from the design of an integral &#x27;roll bar&#x27;, it was still a new concept in the automotive industry, preceding the 1966 Porsche 911 Targa, which popularized it (and established the name). Sason also designed some other unusual features for the Catherina, such as the roof-mounted headlamps (for longer range), which were not included in the prototype because of the need to make the car fit for mass production. 

After test drives on the prototype it was concluded that some more development work was needed. Meanwhile, another prototype, known as Saab MFI13, was prepared by the &quot;Malmö Flygindustri&quot; (MFI) and Saab chose it as a basis for its sports car, the Saab Sonett II. The Catherina ended up on display in the SAAB museum in Trollhättan, but Sason used some of the design cues previewed in the Catherina in his later design, the mass-market Saab 99.

In each book and newspaper article since the 60&#x27;s this prototype has been referred to as &#x27;Catherina&#x27;, but the document from ASJs archive where Sixten Sason suggested the name of the car, it states &quot;Catharina&quot;. The same name is also found on the original name badge on the dashboard that since 2008 once again was re-fitted to the car at the Saab museum.

<text>The Garda Síochána College is the education and training college of the Garda Síochána (Irish police service). It is located at McCan Barracks, Templemore, County Tipperary in Ireland. The college has been in Templemore since 1964.

==History==
The training role was previously undertaken at Garda Headquarters (in the Phoenix Park, Dublin). When in February 1964 training moved to McCan Barracks, it became known as the &quot;Garda Training Centre&quot;, or locally as &quot;the depot&quot;.
In 1992 the Garda College was designated an Institute of Higher Education by the National Council for Education Awards (NCEA). More recently the BA in Applied Policing is awarded by the University of Limerick.

==Training approach development==

The training programme for Recruit Gardaí initially offered at Templemore remained similar to that conducted in the Phoenix Park, which provided for 18 weeks training before being allocated to a Garda Station. After one year &quot;on the job&quot; each Recruit Garda returned to Templemore for a one-month &quot;refresher course&quot;. The training was extended to 22 weeks in the late 1970s. The subjects studied were Police Duties, Irish, and Physical Studies (consisting of Physical Training, Drill, Swimming, and First Aid).

Following a major examination of all training in the Garda Síochána, a new two-year Student/Probationer Education/Training Programme was introduced for trainee Gardaí in April 1989. A major building programme saw the facilities developed and modernised and the name of the institution changed from the Garda Training Centre to the Garda College.

In 1992, the Garda College was designated by the Minister for Education as an institution which the National Council for Educational Awards (NCEA) could accredit. The following year, the two-year Student/Probationer Education/Training Programme was accredited by the NCEA with the award of a National Diploma in Police Studies. A more recent initiative saw the development of a Bachelor of Arts (Police Management) degree for Garda Officers of Superintendent rank upwards.

==Courses offered==
Two main courses are available, both conferred by the &quot;Higher Education and Training Awards Council&quot;:
:* Bachelor of Arts (in Police Studies): for fresh recruits. The entry requirements are mainly age, character, citizenship, education and health-based, and competitions for entry are advertised periodically, usually annually.
:* Bachelor of Arts (in Police Management): for senior officers. The entry requirement is to be a senior manager at superintendent or officer grade. The course&#x27;s main function is to develop those members with additional skills. For a period this course was delivered off-campus, at a hotel in Nenagh, County Tipperary, due to more space being needed for the training of new recruits.

Candidates with other qualifications, particularly technical, may be considered for specific positions where a technical skill set is a prerequisite. This is usually for computer, finance and fraud-based branches and investigations.

Various other specialist courses are available for serving force members.

==College Facilities==
Following a major building programme in 2001, the college has the capacity to accommodate 520 persons. The college has expanded its education facilities and included in the new development are three lecture theatres.

The Garda College has its own nine-hole golf course with a clubhouse and leisure facility. It also has three tennis courts – designed and floodlit to meet international championship standards. In addition the sports field complex comprises full size Gaelic games, soccer and rugby pitches as well as a modern pavilion with changing Rooms, first aid room, weights room and facilities for officials.

Campus facilities include a social club, indoor sports hall with two squash courts and a separate handball alley, a 25-metre swimming pool, fully equipped gymnasium with accompanying leisure facilities.

The Education Block is purpose-built to provide for the education/training requirements of a modern police service. In addition to the technological facilities available, there is also a &#x27;Scenes of Crime Room&#x27;, a &#x27;Mock&#x27; Garda Station, courtroom, language laboratory, classroom facilities and a library containing over 12,000 books.

==Awards==
Probationer Gardaí are recognised for effort and endeavour throughout the two-year programme and on graduation day the following medals are awarded:

:The Gary Sheehan Memorial Medal

:The Gary Sheehan Memorial Medal commemorates Recruit Garda Gary Sheehan, killed on duty at Ballinamore, County Leitrim on 16 December 1983, and is awarded to the best all-round probationer. The recipient will have contributed significantly to life at the Garda College, distinguished himself/herself in the academic field and will have made a significant contribution to the stations and communities in which he/she served. Additionally, the winner will have, by the initiative shown, and leadership qualities so obviously displayed during the training period, won the respect of his/her peers and authorities.

:The Commissioner&#x27;s Medal

:The Commissioner&#x27;s Medal is awarded to the Student achieving the highest aggregate marks in academic subjects over Phase I, III and V Education/Training. The winner will have excelled in Legal, Policing and Technical Studies, the Social Sciences, Communications, Physical Education Studies, Gaeilge and Dissertation.

:The Templemore Town Council Medal

:The Templemore Town Council Medal is awarded to the student who throughout the Student/Probationer Education/Training Course has demonstrated insight and imagination in his/her approach to the Social Science Studies Course and has displayed, through innovative and practical involvement in the social affairs of the communities, within which he/she serves, an appreciation of the key social role of the Gardaí at local and/or national level. The winner will also have distinguished himself/herself academically in the Social Science Studies course.

==Entry==
The recruitment process is by means of a competition where the highest ranked applicants progress to the next stage. The first step is registration with the Public Appointments Service. When the recruitment campaign begins, the applicant is notified and requested to complete an online application form. The applicant will then be invited to book a time and date for the Stage I Aptitude Test. This test consists of three parts: a Skills/Experience Questionnaire, an Analytical Reasoning test and a Job Simulation Exercise. Successful applicants from Stage I will be asked to fill in an application form for Stage II. They will then be given a date and time for interview. The interview stage will consist of three parts: an Interview, a Report Writing Exercise and a Verbal Evaluation Test. Successful applicants will then be requested to fill in a form for their Background checks. Applicants if successful will be asked to participate in a Medical Examination and finally a PCT (Physical Competence Test). Applicants who pass all stages and who are deemed to be acceptable by the Garda Commissioner, will be offered a position as a member of the Garda Síochána.

==Access==

The main artery to the town of Templemore is the N62 National route. Travelling north on this route from Templemore connects to the main Dublin-Limerick motorway (M7 – Junction 22) and Roscrea. Travelling south on the route connects to Thurles and then the main Dublin-Cork motorway (M8 / N8 – Junction 6 Horse and Jockey). The N62 originates in Athlone. The college is accessible off N62 in Templemore at southern end of Templemore (towards Thurles).

To the east, the R433 connects Templemore to the M8 / N8 at a more northerly point (Junction 3) via the villages of Clonmore and Errill and the town of Rathdowney in County Laois. Alternatively, the motorway may be accessed via the village of Templetuohy. To the west, the R501, tracking the Devil&#x27;s Bit mountain range, goes to Borrisoleigh.

Templemore railway station is on the Dublin-Cork railway line operated by Iarnród Éireann. There are direct trains to and from stations like Dublin Heuston railway station (8 trains avg), Thurles (9 trains avg) Cork (4 trains avg) and Limerick (4 trains avg) daily. The college is approximately 2 km from Templemore railway station.

<text>The West Siberian Plain () is a large plain that occupies the western portion of Siberia, between the Ural Mountains in the west and the Yenisei River in the east, and the Altai Mountains on the southeast. Much of the plain is poorly drained and consists of some of the world&#x27;s largest swamps and floodplains. Important cities include Chelyabinsk, Novosibirsk, Omsk, and Tomsk, as well as Surgut and Nizhnevartovsk.

Winters on the West Siberian Plain are harsh and long. The climate of most of the plain areas is either subarctic or continental. The plain had large petroleum and natural gas reserves. Most of Russia&#x27;s oil and gas production was extracted from this area during the 1970s and 80s.

==Geography==

The West Siberian Plain is located east of the Ural Mountains mostly in the territory of Russia. It is one of the Great Russian Regions and has been described as the world&#x27;s largest unbroken lowland – more than 50 percent is less than above sea level—and covers an area of about 2.6– which is about one third of Siberia. It extends from north to south for , reaching its maximum width of in its southern part. from the Arctic Ocean to the foothills of the Altai Mountains, and from east to west for from the Yenisei River to the Ural Mountains. Besides the Yenisei, other main rivers in the West Siberian Plain are from west to east the Irtysh, Ob, Nadym, Pur and Taz. There are many lakes and swamps and large regions of the plains are flooded in the spring.

The long Yenisei River flows broadly south to north, a distance of to the Arctic Ocean, where it discharges more than 20 million litres (5 million gallons) of water per second at its mouth. Together with its tributary Angara, the two rivers flow . The valley formed by the Yenisei acts as a rough dividing line between the West Siberian Plain and the Central Siberian Plateau. The Siberian Uvaly is a low hilly region stretching from east to west across the plain. Glacial deposits extend as far south as the Ob-Irtysh confluence, forming occasional low hills and ridges, including the Ob Plateau in the south, but otherwise the plain is exceedingly flat and featureless. The Ishim Plain and the Baraba Lowland in the south are important agricultural areas. There are salt lakes in the Kulunda Plain, which extends southwards into Kazakhstan and is limited to the south by the Kokshetau Hills.

The West Siberian Plain is very swampy and soils are mostly peaty Histosols and, in the treeless northern part, Histels. is one of the world&#x27;s largest areas of peatlands, which are characterized by raised bogs. Vasyugan Swamp, one of the world&#x27;s largest single raised bogs, covers approximately . There are numerous lakes in the vast interfluve swamps of the Ob-Taz floodplain.

==Flora and fauna==
The plain has eight distinct vegetation regions: tundra, forest-tundra, northern taiga, middle taiga, southern taiga, sub-taiga forest, forest-steppe, and steppe. The number of animal species in the West Siberian Plain ranges from at least 107 in the tundra to 278 or more in the forest-steppe region. In the south of the plain, where permafrost is largely absent, rich grasslands that are an extension of the Kazakh Steppe formed the original vegetation, which had almost all been cleared by the early 21st century.

==Geology==

The West Siberian Plain consists mostly of Cenozoic alluvial deposits and is extraordinarily flat. A rise of fifty metres in sea level would cause all land between the Arctic Ocean and the Ob-Irtysh confluence near Khanty-Mansiysk to be inundated (see also Turgai Straits, West Siberian Glacial Lake). It is a region of the Earth&#x27;s crust that has undergone prolonged subsidence and is composed of horizontal deposits from as much as 65 million years ago. Many of the deposits on this plain result from ice dams that reversed the flow of the Ob and Yenisei rivers, redirecting them into the Caspian Sea, and perhaps the Aral Sea as well.

<doc id="547325" wikidata="Q4175306" url="?curid=547325" title="Air Battalion Royal Engineers">
<text>The Air Battalion Royal Engineers (ABRE) was the first flying unit of the British Armed Forces to make use of heavier-than-air craft. Founded in 1911, the battalion in 1912 became part of the Royal Flying Corps, which in turn evolved into the Royal Air Force.

==Establishment==
In 1911, following the growth in early aviation activity, the War Office issued instructions for the School of Ballooning, which had originally been formed in 1888, to be expanded into a battalion. An order was issued on 28 February 1911 for the formation of the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers effective 1 April the same year. The initial establishment was 14 officers and 150 other ranks. Officers could be selected from any branch of the service whereas other ranks were selected from the Corps of Royal Engineers.

Pilots had to already have earned a Royal Aero Club certificate from a private flying school. The GBP 75 charge for flight training was reimbursed only if the student passed the course.

==Structure and activities==
The battalion comprised two companies and a headquarters located at Farnborough. The commander of the Air Battalion was Major Sir Alexander Bannerman.

No. 1 Company, at Farnborough, was equipped with airships and was under the command of Captain Edward Maitland, an experienced balloon and airship pioneer. He also helped pioneer the parachute and in 1913 made the first parachute jump from an airship.

No. 2 Company, at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain, was equipped with aeroplanes and was commanded by Captain John Fulton. A mechanical engineer from the Royal Field Artillery, Fulton had been an early enthusiast of military flying and had attended the world&#x27;s first air show at Rheims in 1909. He had earned his pilot&#x27;s certificate, number 27, on 15 November 1910.

On 17 September 1911, Lt. R.A. Cammell, RE was killed in the crash of a Valkyrie monoplane at Hendon airfield; a 1922 account of the formation of the RAF states this was the only fatal accident in the Air Battalion.

On 14 February 1912, Lt. Barrington-Kennet flew a government-bought aeroplane – a two-seater Nieuport monoplane with a 50 hp Gnome engine – 249.5 miles in 4 hours and 32 minutes, setting a record.

==Creation of the Royal Flying Corps==
In October 1911, Italy&#x27;s use of aircraft in combat against the Ottoman Empire in Tripoli, Libya led to the formation of a sub-committee of the British Imperial Defence Staff to recommend policy for the future of British military flying. The committee recommended the formation of a separate flying corps and on 13 April 1912 the Royal Flying Corps was created, with the Air Battalion becoming its Military Wing on 13 May.

No. 1 Company became No. 1 Squadron RFC on 1 April 1911.

No. 2 Company became No. 3 Squadron RFC on 1 April 1911 and a detachment of No. 2 Company became No. 2 Squadron RFC on 13 May 1912.

<text>JMC, or Jim Melton Cyclery was a bicycle company in the 1970s and 1980s. It started as a bicycle shop in 1969. It began manufacturing bicycle components in 1974, mostly to make a bicycle look more like a motocross motorcycle, including fenders and false fuel tanks. In 1977 JMC began manufacturing BMX bicycles. During the 1970s and 80&#x27;s, it sponsored such notable BMX racers, such as Harry Leary, Clint Miller, Tinker Juarez, and Darrell Young, Andy Patterson, Solan Foster, Gary DeBacker, Melanie Cline, Carl Butler and Sam Arellano. 

By 1979 the bicycle shop was sold and the company owned just the factory. Sales peaked in 1981 when it was number two of the American Bicycle Association title for top BMX factory team three years in a row. Jim Melton closed the company in July 1985 because of his wife Vera&#x27;s poor health, and the company faced tough competition from cheap BMX-bikes made in Taiwan, and he did not want to move production abroad. Jim Melton died in late July, 2014.

==Models==
The JMC Black Shadow was a desirable of their models with a reputation for light weight and an excellent black finish. The most sought after models today are the Darrell Young pro model and the Andy Patterson pro model.

<text>Tiverton is a community in the Municipality of Kincardine, Bruce County, Ontario, Canada. It is near the shore of Lake Huron on Highway 21 between Port Elgin and Kincardine.

== History ==

The name of a town in Devon, England. It is said that Norman McInnis and the other petitioners, when applying for a post-office, suggested the name &quot;St. Andrews.&quot; This the department would not agree to, there being another post-office of that name. Of several names offered &quot;Tiverton&quot; was chosen, it being the name of the borough for which Lord Palmerston, the English Prime Minister, sat in Parliament, and this no doubt had something to do with the choice made.

It was in the fall of 1850 that the primeval forest that covered the present site of Tiverton was entered by its first settler, Timothy Allan. The survey of the north part of Kincardine Township had just been completed, but that part of the township of Bruce in which Tiverton lies had not been commenced. For several years the work of clearing the bush went steadily on before the idea of a village at that spot was thought of. It was the fortune of the author, in the spring of 1857, to tramp along the &quot;Boundary Line&quot; from Inverhuron east to the fifteenth side-road, but he cannot recall of then seeing any evidence of the village that subsequently was developed.

It was, however, in the same year that Norman McInnis there opened a store, and it is probably the year which Tiverton may claim as that when it commenced to take form; but it was 1860 before it became known by the name it now bears, that is, when &quot;Tiverton&quot; was given as the name of the post-office then opened. The one store was the most suitable place for the office, so naturally the postmastership was given to Norman McInnis, of whom it may be said in passing, he, as much as anyone else, deserves the honor of being called the founder of the village.

He it was who opened the first store and also the first manufacturing industry of the place, which was a pot and pearl-ash factory, which he commenced to operate in September, 1860. The next industry added to this was a wool-carding mill run by A. McBain, which mill at a later date passed into the hands of James McLeod. About the end of the sixties a grist mill was added to the industries of the village, John McLeod being the miller. John Dewar, also, about the same time, opened a store, the second in Tiverton.

From this time, and for the next ten or twelve years Tiverton became somewhat of a market. The grain there purchased used to be delivered at one of the warehouses at Inverhuron; this business ceased with the burning of these warehouses in 1882, as they never were rebuilt. It was during these years the village attained to its highest notch as a business centre, and new industries were started, among which were a sawmill, a planing-mill and machine shop, but the largest and most prominent of them was John McDonald&#x27;s tannery, which employed about twenty-five hands and had an output of about $20,000 worth of leather per annum.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Tiverton had a population of 717 living in 313 of its 382 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 725. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Economy==
Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, the largest nuclear facility in North America in terms of output, is located in Tiverton.

Tiverton was home to the Steelback Brewery, which closed in 2010. There is a public Library, an arena and sports facility, and a fire department.

<doc id="547335" wikidata="Q5581626" url="?curid=547335" title="Gone to Texas">
<text>Gone to Texas (often abbreviated GTT), was a phrase used by Americans emigrating to Texas in the 19th century. During the Panic of 1819, many left the United States and moved there to escape debt. Moving to Texas, which at the time was part of Mexico, was particularly popular among debtors from the South and West.

Emigrants or their abandoned neighbors often wrote the phrase on doors of abandoned houses or posted as a sign on fences.

While speaking in Nacogdoches, Texas in early 1836, shortly before his death at The Alamo, Davy Crockett is quoted regarding his last campaign for Congress:
A gentleman from Nacogdoches, in Texas, informs us, that, whilst there, he dined in public with col. Crockett, who had just arrived from Tennessee. The old bear-hunter, on being toasted, made a speech to the Texians, replete with his usual dry humor. He began nearly in this style: &quot;I am told, gentlemen, that, when a stranger, like myself, arrives among you, the first inquiry is—what brought you here? To satisfy your curiosity at once as to myself, I will tell you all about it. I was, for some years, a member of congress. In my last canvass, I told the people of my district, that, if they saw fit to re-elect me, I would serve them faithfully as I had done; but, if not, they might all go to , and I would go to Texas. I was beaten, gentlemen, and here I am.&quot; The roar of applause was like a thunder-burst.

In the 21st-century, The phrase &quot;Gone to Texas&quot; can still be used as Texas is currently the second most populous state in the United States and is experiencing strong population growth by migration with an estimated July 2019 population of 28.996 million.

<doc id="547337" wikidata="Q2366126" url="?curid=547337" title="Sixty-fourth note">
<text>In music notation, a sixty-fourth note (North American), or hemidemisemiquaver or semidemisemiquaver (British), sometimes called a half-thirty-second note, is a note played for half the duration of a thirty-second note (or demisemiquaver), hence the name. It first occurs in the late 17th century and, apart from rare occurrences of hundred twenty-eighth notes (semihemidemisemiquavers) and two hundred fifty-sixth notes (demisemihemidemisemiquavers), it is the shortest value found in musical notation.
Sixty-fourth notes are notated with a filled-in oval notehead and a straight note stem with four flags. The stem is drawn to the left of the notehead going downward when the note is above or on the middle line of the staff. When the notehead is below the middle line the stem is drawn to the right of the notehead going upward. A single 64th note is always stemmed with flags, while two or more are usually beamed in groups.
A similar, but rarely encountered symbol is the sixty-fourth [[rest (music)|rest]] (or hemidemisemiquaver rest, shown in figure 1) which denotes silence for the same duration as a sixty-fourth note.

Notes shorter than a sixty-fourth note are very rarely used, though the hundred twenty-eighth note—otherwise known as the &quot;semihemidemisemiquaver&quot;—and even shorter notes, are occasionally found.

<doc id="547346" wikidata="Q266119" url="?curid=547346" title="James McHenry">
<text>James McHenry (November 16, 1753 – May 3, 1816) was a Scotch-Irish American military surgeon, statesman, and a Founding Father of the United States. McHenry was a signer of the United States Constitution from Maryland, initiated the recommendation for Congress to form the Navy, and was the eponym of Fort McHenry. He represented Maryland in the Continental Congress. He was a delegate to the Maryland State Convention of 1788, to vote whether Maryland should ratify the proposed Constitution of the United States. He served as United States Secretary of War from 1796 to 1800, bridging the administrations of George Washington and John Adams. At the time of his death, McHenry owned 10 slaves, most of whom either worked as household servants or maintained his estate.

==Early life and education==
McHenry was born into a Presbyterian Scots-Irish/Ulster Scots family in Ballymena, County Antrim, Ireland, in 1753. Alarmed that he was becoming sick from excessive studying, his family in 1771 sent him to North America to recuperate. Recent scholarship suggests that the family may have also sent him to the colonies as an &quot;advanced scout&quot; to see if the entire family would wish to relocate, which they did a year later. Upon arrival, McHenry lived with a family friend in Philadelphia before finishing his preparatory education at Newark Academy in Delaware. Afterward, he returned to Philadelphia, where he apprenticed under Benjamin Rush and became a physician.

==Medical career==
McHenry served as a skilled and dedicated surgeon during the American Revolutionary War. On August 10, 1776, he was appointed surgeon of the Fifth Pennsylvania Battalion, stationed at Fort Washington (New York). He was taken prisoner the following November when the fort was taken by Sir William Howe. While in British custody, he observed that prisoners were given very poor medical attention and initiated reports to that effect, to no avail.

He was paroled in January 1777, then released from parole in March 1778. Having sufficiently impressed George Washington, he was appointed aide as secretary to the commander-in-chief in May 1779. McHenry was present at the Battle of Monmouth. In August 1780, he was transferred to Lafayette&#x27;s staff, where he remained until he retired from the army in the autumn of 1781.

Although eligible, McHenry did not join The Society of the Cincinnati as an original member when it was established in 1783. His son John was admitted as a member in the state of Maryland in 1816, representing his father.

==Political career==

He was elected by the legislature to the Maryland Senate on September 17, 1781, and as delegate to Congress on December 2, 1784. In 1787, he was a Maryland delegate to the Constitutional Convention, which drafted the United States Constitution. After a controversial campaign, he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates on October 10, 1788. Two years later he retired from public life and spent a year actively engaged in mercantile business. On November 15, 1791, he accepted a second term in the Maryland Senate and served five years.

During Washington&#x27;s second term as president (1793–97), political events created a number of vacancies in his cabinet. After several other candidates had declined the office, Washington appointed McHenry secretary of war in 1796 and immediately assigned him the task of facilitating the transition of Western military posts from Great Britain&#x27;s control to that of the United States under the terms of the Jay Treaty.

McHenry advised the Senate committee against reducing military forces. He was instrumental in reorganizing the United States Army into four regiments of infantry, a troop of dragoons, and a battery of artillery. He is credited with establishing the United States Department of the Navy, based on his recommendation that the &quot;War Department should be assisted by a commissioner of marine&quot; on March 8, 1798.

During President John Adams&#x27;s administration (1797–1801), McHenry continued as Secretary of War, as Adams had decided to keep the newly established institution of the presidential cabinet intact. Adams gradually found that three members of the cabinet repeatedly opposed him: McHenry, Secretary of State Timothy Pickering, and Treasury Secretary Oliver Wolcott Jr. They appeared to listen more to Alexander Hamilton than to the president and publicly disagreed with Adams about his foreign policy, particularly with regard to France. Instead of resigning, they stayed in office to work against his official policy. It is unknown if Adams knew they were being disloyal. Although many liked McHenry personally, Washington, Hamilton, and Wolcott were said to have complained of his incompetence as an administrator.

McHenry attributed Adams&#x27;s troubles as chief executive to his long and frequent absences from the capital, leaving business in the hands of secretaries who bore responsibility without the power to properly conduct it. After a stormy meeting with his cabinet in May 1800, Adams requested McHenry&#x27;s resignation, which he submitted on May 13. To succeed McHenry, Adams named Samuel Dexter. During the election of 1800, McHenry goaded Hamilton into releasing his indictment against the president, which questioned Adams&#x27;s loyalty and patriotism, sparking public quarrels over the major candidates and eventually paving the way for Thomas Jefferson to be elected as the next president. The pamphlet leaked past its intended audience, giving the people reason to oppose the Federalists, since that group seemed to be dividing into bitter factions.

==Later life==

In 1792, McHenry had purchased a 95-acre tract from Ridgely&#x27;s Delight and named it Fayetteville in honor of his friend, the Marquis de Lafayette; he spent his remaining years there. During that time, McHenry continued frequent correspondence with his friends and associates, in particular Pickering and Benjamin Tallmadge, with whom he maintained Federalist ideals and exchanged progress of the War of 1812.

An attack of paralysis in 1814 left him with severe pain and complete loss of the use of his legs. He died two years later. Upon the death of her beloved husband, Mrs. McHenry wrote:

Here we come to the end of a life of a courteous, high-minded, keen-spirited, Christian gentleman. He was not a great man, but participated in great events and great men loved him, while all men appreciated his goodness and purity of soul. His highest titles to remembrance are that he was faithful to every duty and that he was the intimate and trusted friend of Lafayette, of Hamilton, and of Washington.

<doc id="547347" wikidata="Q7489957" url="?curid=547347" title="Sharon, Ontario">
<text>Sharon (formerly Hope) is a former village now incorporated into the municipality of the Town of East Gwillimbury, Ontario, Canada, formerly the Township of East Gwillimbury. The municipal offices of the town are in Sharon.

The community&#x27;s most historic building is the Sharon Temple, once the meeting house of the Children of Peace (or Davidites). It is part of the musical, political, religious and architectural heritage of Ontario and is now a museum and National Historic Site of Canada. The museum hosts a number of concerts and educational programs, and has hosted the Words Alive Literary Festival since 2007.

In the mid to late 1980s, housing developments were built in the area around Sharon. Further developments have continued slowly around Sharon since 2002.

==History==
The village of Sharon grew around the farm of David Willson (Lot 10, Second Conc.), the leader of the Quaker denomination known as the Children of Peace. The Children of Peace constructed a series of meeting houses on Willson&#x27;s farm, which became the core of the utopian community they called Hope. They changed the name to Sharon in 1841 (after the Sharon Temple) to acquire a post office.

<text>The British West Indies dollar (BWI$) was the currency of British Guiana and the Eastern Caribbean territories of the British West Indies from 1949 to 1965, when it was largely replaced by the East Caribbean dollar, and was one of the currencies used in Jamaica from 1954 to 1964. The monetary policy of the currency was overseen by the British Caribbean Currency Board (BCCB). It was the official currency used by the West Indies Federation. The British West Indies dollar was never used in British Honduras, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas, or Bermuda.

==History==
Queen Anne&#x27;s proclamation of 1704 introduced the pound sterling currency system to the British West Indies; however it failed to displace the existing Spanish dollar currency system right up until the late 1870s. In 1822, the British government coined , , and fractional &#x27;Anchor dollars&#x27; for use in Mauritius and the British West Indies (but not Jamaica). A few years later copper fractional dollars were coined for Mauritius, Sierra Leone, and the British West Indies.

The next move to introduce British sterling silver coinage to the colonies came with an imperial order-in-council dated 1825. This move was inspired by a number of factors. The United Kingdom was now operating a very successful gold standard in relation to the gold sovereign that was introduced in 1816, and there was a desire to extend this system to the colonies. In addition to this, there was that the supply of Spanish dollars (pieces of eight) had been cut off as a result of the revolutions in Latin America where most of the Spanish dollars were minted. The last Spanish Dollar was in fact minted at Potosi in 1825. There was now a growing desire to have a stable and steady supply of British shillings everywhere where the British drum was beating. The 1825 order-in-council was largely a failure because it made sterling silver coinage legal tender at the unrealistic rating in relation to the Spanish dollar of = 4 shillings and 4 pence. It did succeed in Jamaica, Bermuda, and British Honduras because the authorities in those territories set aside the official ratings and used the more realistic rating of = 4 shillings. The reality of the rating between the dollar and the pound was based on the silver content of the Spanish pieces of eight as compared to the gold content of the British gold sovereign.

A second imperial order-in-council was passed in 1838 with the correct rating of = 4 shillings 2 pence. In the years following the 1838 order-in-council, the British West Indies territories began to enact local legislation for the purposes of assimilating their monies of account with the British pound sterling. Gold discoveries in Australia in 1851 drove the silver dollar out of the West Indies, but it returned again with the great depreciation in the value of silver that followed with Germany&#x27;s transition to the gold standard between 1871 and 1873. In the years immediately following 1873, there was a fear that the British West Indies might return to a silver standard. As such, legislation was passed in the individual territories to demonetize the silver dollars. Even though the British coinage was also silver, it represented fractions of the gold sovereign and so its value was based on a gold standard. 
During this period, and into the nineteenth century, accounts could be kept in either dollars or sterling. Jamaica, Bermuda, and the Bahamas preferred to use sterling accounts whereas British Guiana used dollar accounts. British Guiana used dollar accounts for the purpose of assisting in the transition from the Dutch guilder system of currency to the British pound sterling system. In the Eastern Caribbean territories the private sector preferred to use dollar accounts whereas the government preferred to use sterling accounts. In some of the Eastern Caribbean territories, notes were issued by various private banks, denominated in dollars equivalent to 4 shillings 2 pence. See Antigua dollar, Barbadian dollar, Dominican dollar, Grenadan dollar, Guyanese dollar, Saint Kitts dollar, Saint Lucia dollar, Saint Vincent dollar and Trinidad and Tobago dollar.

In 1946, a West Indian Currency Conference saw Barbados, British Guiana, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago and the Windward Islands agree to establish a unified decimal currency system based on a West Indian dollar to replace the current arrangement of having three different Boards of Commissioners of Currency (for Barbados (which also served the Leeward and Windward Islands), British Guiana and Trinidad &amp; Tobago).

In 1949, the British government formalized the dollar system of accounts in British Guiana and the Eastern Caribbean territories by introducing the British West Indies dollar (BWI$) at the already existing conversion rate of per pound sterling (or = 4 shillings 2 pence). It was one of the many experimental political and economic ventures tested by the British government to form a uniform system within their British West Indies territories. The currency was known verbally as the &quot;Beewee&quot; (slang for British West Indies) dollar. In 1950, the British Caribbean Currency Board (BCCB) was set up in Trinidad with the sole right to issue notes and coins of the new unified currency and given the mandate of keeping full foreign exchange cover to ensure convertibility at per pound sterling. In 1951, the British Virgin Islands joined the arrangement, but this led to discontent because that territory was more naturally drawn to the currency of the neighbouring US Virgin Islands. In 1959, the British Virgin Islands withdrew from the arrangement and adopted the US dollar.

Until 1955, the BWI$ existed only as banknotes in conjunction with sterling fractional coinage. Decimal coins replaced the sterling coins in 1955. These decimal coins were denominated in cents, with each cent being worth one halfpenny in sterling.

In 1958, the West Indies Federation was established and the BWI$ was its currency. However, although Jamaica (including the Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands) was part of the West Indies Federation, it retained the Jamaican pound, despite adopting the BWI$ as legal tender from 1954. Jamaica, the Cayman Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands were already long established users of the sterling accounts system of pounds, shillings, and pence.

In 1964 Jamaica ended the legal tender status of the BWI$ and Trinidad and Tobago withdrew from the currency union (adopting the Trinidad and Tobago dollar) forcing the movement of the headquarters of the BCCB from Trinidad to Barbados and soon the &quot;BWI$&quot; dollar lost its regional support.

In 1965, the British West Indies dollar of the now defunct West Indies Federation was replaced at par by the East Caribbean dollar and the BCCB was replaced by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority or ECCA (established by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Agreement 1965). British Guiana withdrew from the currency union the following year. Grenada rejoined the common currency arrangement in 1968 having utilized the Trinidad and Tobago dollar from 1964. Barbados withdrew from the currency union in 1972, following which the ECCA headquarters were moved to St. Kitts.

Between 1965 and 1983, the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority issued the EC$, with banknotes from 1965 and coins from 1981. The EC$ is now issued by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, based in the city of Basseterre, in Saint Kitts and Nevis. The bank was established by an agreement (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Agreement) signed at Port of Spain on 5 July 1983.

The exchange rate of = £1 sterling (equivalent to the old = 4s 2d) continued right into up until 1976 for the new Eastern Caribbean dollar.

For a wider outline of the history of currency in the region see Currencies of the British West Indies.

==Coins==
Coins were introduced in 1955 in denominations of , 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents, minted under the name of &quot;British Caribbean Territories, Eastern Group&quot;. The , 1, and 2 cent coins were bronze and of the same weight and diameter as British farthing, halfpenny, and one penny coins. The 5 cents coin was brass while the 10, 25, and 50 cents were cupro-nickel. These coins remained in circulation until 1981, with the exception of the cent, which was withdrawn in 1965. All coins bore the image of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse.

==Banknotes==
The first banknotes in the British West Indies were issued by private banks, including the Colonial Bank, Barclays Bank (which took over the Colonial Bank) and the Royal Bank of Canada. Issues were made at Antigua, Barbados, British Guiana, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Trinidad and Tobago. The main feature of interest about these banknotes was that they displayed the dual accountancy system by stating the amount in both pounds sterling and in Spanish dollars at the automatic conversion rate of $1 = 4 shillings and 2 pence sterling.

There were also government issues for Barbados and British Guiana.

In 1950, the first issues made for all the participating colonies, in the name of the &quot;British Caribbean Territories, Eastern Group&quot;. These were in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 100 dollars. These notes replaced all earlier issues in 1951. The 1950-1951 issues bore the portrait of King George VI, with those between 1953 and 1964 bearing that of Queen Elizabeth II.

The serial number prefixes are located on the front of the note, and those of the King George VI series are fractional while those of the Queen Elizabeth II series are alphanumeric. The backs of all notes of both series are identical except for the color. Depicted are the Coat of Arms of the Leeward Islands and the Colonial Badges of British Guiana, Barbados, Windward Islands, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago.

In March 1965, the East Caribbean Currency Authority (ECCA) was founded following the withdrawal from the British Caribbean Currency Board of British Guiana and Trinidad and Tobago to establish their respective central banks.

<text>Saterland Frisian, also known as Sater Frisian, Saterfrisian or Saterlandic ( ), spoken in the Saterland municipality of Lower Saxony in Germany, is the last living dialect of the East Frisian language. It is closely related to the other Frisian languages: North Frisian, spoken in Germany as well, and West Frisian, spoken in the Dutch province of Friesland.

==Classification==
From a diachronical perspective, Saterland Frisian is an &quot;Emsfrisian&quot; dialect of the East Frisian language. Emsfrisian used to be spoken in the western half of the East Frisian peninsula and in the Ommelanden. The other East Frisian dialect group was the &quot;Weserfrisian&quot;, formerly spoken from the eastern half of the East Frisian peninsula to beyond the Weser.

Together with West Frisian and North Frisian it belongs to the Frisian branch of the Germanic languages. The three Frisian languages evolved from Old Frisian. Among the living Frisian dialects, the one spoken in Heligoland (called Halunder) is the closest to Saterland Frisian. The closest language other than Frisian dialects is English.

Frisian and English are often grouped together as Anglo-Frisian languages. Today, English, Frisian and Lower German, sometimes also Dutch, are grouped together under the label North Sea Germanic. Low German, which is closely related to Saterland Frisian, lacks many North Sea Germanic features already from the Old Saxon period onward. In turn, Saterland Frisian has had prolonged close contact with Low German.

==History ==
Settlers from East Frisia, who left their homelands around 1100 A.D. due to natural disasters, established the Frisian language in the Saterland. Since the sparse population at the time of their arrival spoke Old Saxon, the Frisian language of the settlers came into close contact with Low German.

In East Frisia, the assimilation of Frisian speakers into the Low German speaking population was well under way in the early 16th century. The dialect of the Saterland persisted mostly due to geography: As the Saterland is surrounded by bogland, its inhabitants had few contacts with adjacent regions. The villages built on sandy hills were basically like islands. Until the 19th century, the settlement area was almost exclusively reachable by boat via the river Sagter Ems (), the exception being walking on frozen or dried out bogland during times of extreme weather.

Politically, the land did not belong to the County of East Frisia, which came into existence in the 15th century, but changed hands frequently until it became part of County of Oldenburg. The resulting border was not merely political, but also denominational, as the Saterland was recatholicized. The Saterland was linguistically and culturally different from Oldenburg, too. This led to further isolation.

Colonialization of the bogland, the construction of roads and railways led to the Saterland being less isolated. Still, Saterfrisian managed, because most of the community living in the Saterland continued to use the language. This common linguistic area was disturbed following World War II. German repatriates from Eastern Europe were settled in the Saterland, leading to Standard German gradually replacing Saterfrisian. While the predicted language death in the late 20th century did not happen, and the number of speakers being stable, the Saterfrisian speaking community nowadays make up only a minority of those living in the Saterland.

== Geographic distribution==

Today, estimates of the number of speakers vary slightly. Saterland Frisian is spoken by about 2,250 people, out of a total population in Saterland of some 10,000; an estimated 2,000 people speak the language well, slightly fewer than half of those being native speakers. The great majority of native speakers belong to the older generation; Saterland Frisian is thus a seriously endangered language. It might, however, no longer be moribund, as several reports suggest that the number of speakers is rising among the younger generation, some of whom raise their children in Saterlandic.
=== Current revitalization efforts ===
Since about 1800, Sater Frisian has attracted the interest of a growing number of linguists. Media coverage sometimes argues that this linguistic interest, particularly the work of Marron Curtis Fort, helped preserve the language and revive interest among speakers in transmitting it to the next generation. During the last century, a small literature developed in it. Also, the New Testament of the Bible was translated into Sater Frisian by Fort, who was himself a Christian.

Children&#x27;s books in Saterlandic are few, compared to those in German. Margaretha (Gretchen) Grosser, a retired member of the community of Saterland, has translated many children&#x27;s books from German into Saterlandic. A full list of the books and the time of their publication can be seen on the German Wikipedia page of Margaretha Grosser.

Recent efforts to revitalize Saterlandic include the creation of an app called &quot; (Little Sater Frisians) on Google Play. According to the app&#x27;s description, it aims at making the language fun for children to learn, as it teaches them Saterlandic vocabulary in many different domains (the supermarket, the farm, the church). There have been more than 500 downloads of the app since its release in December 2016, according to statistics on Google Play Store.

The language remains capable of producing neologisms as evidenced by a competition during the Covid-19 pandemic to create a Saterfrisian word for anti-Covid face masks held in late 2020 / early 2021 which resulted in the term &quot; being adopted with face masks having the Saterfrisian sentence &quot;&quot; (&quot;Under this face mask, Saterfrisian is spoken&quot;) written on them gaining some local popularity.

=== Official status ===
The German government has not committed significant resources to the preservation of Sater Frisian. Most of the work to secure the endurance of this language is therefore done by the &quot;Seelter Buund&quot; (&quot;Saterlandic Alliance&quot;). Along with North Frisian and five other languages, Sater Frisian was included in Part III of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages by Germany in 1998.

=== Dialects ===
There are three fully mutually intelligible dialects, corresponding to the three main villages of the municipality of Saterland: Ramsloh (Saterlandic: ), Scharrel (), and Strücklingen (). The Ramsloh dialect now somewhat enjoys a status as a standard language, since a grammar and a word list were based on it.

== Phonology ==
The phonology of Saterland Frisian is regarded as very conservative linguistically, as the entire East Frisian language group was conservative with regards to Old Frisian. The following tables are based on studies by Marron C. Fort.

=== Vowels ===

==== Monophthongs ====
The consonant is often realised as a vowel in the syllable coda depending on its syllable structure.

Short vowels:
Semi-long vowels:
Long vowels:
==== Diphthongs ====

=== Consonants ===

Today, voiced plosives in the syllable coda are usually terminally devoiced. Older speakers and a few others may use voiced codas.

====Plosives====

====Fricatives====
====Other consonants====
== Morphology ==
=== Personal pronouns ===
The subject pronouns of Saterland Frisian are as follows:
The numbers 1–10 in Saterland Frisian are as follows:

Numbers one through three in Saterland Frisian vary in form based on the gender of the noun they occur with. In the table, &quot;m.&quot; stands for masculine, &quot;f.&quot; for feminine, and &quot;n.&quot; for neuter.

For the purposes of comparison, here is a table with numbers 1–10 in 4 West Germanic languages:
== Vocabulary ==
The Saterlfrisian language preserved some lexical peculiarities of East Frisian, such as the verb replacing the equivalent of in all contexts (e.g. , German: Doch gibt es Leute, die da sprechen; &#x27;Yet there are people, who speak&#x27;) or (&#x27;to say&#x27;) compare English &#x27;quoth&#x27;. In Old Frisian, and existed (, &#x27;Augustinus said and said&#x27;). Another word, common in earlier forms of Western Germanic, but survived only in East Frisian is meaning &#x27;knife&#x27; (comp. Seax).

== Orthography ==
Saterland Frisian became a written language relatively recently. German orthography cannot adequately represent the vowel rich Frisian language. Until the mid-20th century, scholars researching it developed their own orthography. The poet Gesina Lechte-Siemer, who published poems in Saterfrisian since the 1930s, adopted a proposal by the cultural historian Julius Bröring.

In the 1950s Jelle Brouwer, professor in Groningen, an orthography based on the Dutch one, which failed to gain widespread acceptance. The West Frisian Pyt Kramer, who did research in Saterfrisian, developed a phonemic orthography. The American linguist Marron Curtis Fort used Brouwer&#x27;s Dutch-based orthography as a basis for his own proposal. The most notable difference between the two orthographies is the way long vowels are represented. Kramer proposes that long vowels always be spelled with a double vowels ( &#x27;to speak&#x27;), while Fort maintains, that long vowels in open syllables be spelled with a single vowels, as Frisian vowels in open syllables are always long ( &#x27;to speak&#x27;). Both proposals use almost no diacritics, apart from Fort&#x27;s use of acutes to differentiate long vowels from semi-long ones.

So far, no standard has evolved. Those projects tutored by Kramer use his orthography while Fort published his works in his orthography, which is also recognized by the German authorities. Others use a compromise. This lack of standards leads to the village Scharrel being spelled on its town sign instead of the currently used .

== In the media ==
, a German-language regional daily newspaper based in Oldenburg, Germany, publishes occasional articles in Saterland Frisian. The articles are also made available on the newspaper&#x27;s Internet page, under the headline .

As of 2004, the regional radio station &quot;Ems-Vechte-Welle&quot; broadcasts a 2-hour program in Saterland Frisian and Low German entitled &quot;Middeeges&quot;. The program is aired every other Sunday from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. The first hour of the program is usually reserved for Saterland Frisian. The program usually consists of interviews about local issues between music. The station can be streamed live though the station&#x27;s Internet page.

== Sample text ==

<text>North Frisian is a minority language of Germany, spoken by about 10,000 people in North Frisia. The language is part of the larger group of the West Germanic Frisian languages. The language comprises 10 dialects which are themselves divided into an insular and a mainland group.

North Frisian is closely related to the Saterland Frisian language of Northwest Germany and West Frisian which is spoken in the Netherlands. All of these are also closely related to the English language forming the Anglo-Frisian group.

The phonological system of the North Frisian dialects is strongly being influenced by Standard German and is slowly adapting to that of the German language. With a number of native speakers probably even less than 10,000 and decreasing use in mainland North Frisia, the North Frisian language is endangered. It is protected as a minority language and has become an official language in the Nordfriesland district and on Heligoland island.

==Classification==
The closest relatives of North Frisian are the two other Frisian languages, the Saterland Frisian of north-western Lower Saxony, Germany, and the West Frisian language spoken in the northern Netherlands. Together, the three sub-groups form the group of Frisian languages.

English is also closely related to Frisian. The two are classified in a common Anglo-Frisian group, which is grouped among the Ingvaeonic languages, together with Low German. The related Low German has developed differently since Old Saxon times and has lost many Ingvaeonic characteristics.

==Dialects==
===Overview===
The North Frisian dialects can be grouped into two main dialectal divisions: mainland and insular dialects. Altogether, both groups have 10 dialects. Since the beginning of Frisian linguistic studies in the 19th century, the following ten dialects have typically been noted as distinct:

====Insular North Frisian====
* Sylt Frisian (Söl&#x27;ring)
* Föhr-Amrum Frisian (Fering, Öömrang)
* Heligolandic Frisian (Halunder)

====Mainland North Frisian====
* Wiedingharde Frisian (Wiringhiirder)
* Bökingharde Frisian (Mooringer)
* Karrharde Frisian (Karrharder)
* Goesharde Frisian (Gooshirder)
** Northern Goesharde Frisian (incl. Hoorninger Fräisch &amp; Hoolmer Freesch)
** Central Goesharde Frisian
** Southern Goesharde Frisian (extinct since early 1980s)
* Halligen Frisian (Halifreesk)

The mainland and insular dialects clearly differ from each other because they were shaped by Frisian immigrants in different centuries. The islands of Sylt, Föhr and Amrum were colonised in around AD 800, and the mainland was settled by Frisians in AD 1100.

There are also various influences of neighbouring languages on the dialects. On Sylt, Föhr and Amrum and in parts of the northern mainland such as Wiedingharde, there is a strong Danish (South Jutlandic) influence, but on Heligoland and the rest of mainland North Frisia, the Low German influence is predominant. Moreover, there has historically been little exchange between the dialects and so hardly any lingua franca could develop and there was no cultural centre in North Frisia for which the dialect could have had a leading role.

=== Samples ===
The sentence displayed below in many variants reads, Shine, old moon, shine!&#x27;, cried Häwelmann, but the moon was nowhere to be seen and the stars neither; they had all already gone to bed&quot; (based on Theodor Storm&#x27;s &quot;Der kleine Häwelmann&quot;).

; Insular
Söl&#x27;ring (dialect of Sylt)

Fering-Öömrang (dialect of Föhr and Amrum)

Heligolandic (dialect of Helgoland)

; Mainland
Northern Goesharde Frisian, Hoorninger Fräisch variety of Langenhorn

Wiedingharde Frisian

Halligen Frisian (although it is spoken on the Halligen islands, it is linguistically grouped with the mainland dialects)

Mooring (dialect of Bökingharde)

Despite the differences between the dialects, the Fering and Öömrang are highly similar; in this example nearly identical.

Another source that highlights the differences between all of the main dialects of North Frisian (even extinct ones) are translations of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer.

The following table further demonstrates the similarities and differences between the various dialects.
===Extinct dialects===
The Eiderstedt Frisian on the Eiderstedt peninsula were abandoned in favour of Low German during the 17th and 18th centuries. In contrast to the northern hundreds, Eiderstedt was economically strong and wealthy and was oriented towards the southern, Low German parts of Schleswig-Holstein. Moreover, there was a strong Dutch immigration during the 16th century.

A similar situation was to be found on the island of Strand, which was destroyed during the Burchardi flood. The population of the eastern, remaining part of Strand, the modern Nordstrand, did not succeed in rebuilding the dikes on their own. Therefore, many Frisian speaking people left their homeland on Strand or were otherwise not able to maintain their native language against mostly Dutch-speaking immigrants. On Pellworm, the western remainder of Strand, the repair of the dikes was quickly accomplished and so the Frisian language was still spoken in the 18th century, until it also vanished due to changes in population structure. The old Strand Frisian was presumably closest to Halligen Frisian.

Likewise close to Halligen Frisian was the Wyk Frisian that used to be spoken in Wyk auf Föhr until the town completely shifted to Low German. The Wyk dialect is thought to have developed from the dialects of immigrants from the Halligen and Strand island.

The dialect that most recently died out is Southern Goesharde Frisian which became extinct with the death of its last speaker in the early 1980s. Other mainland dialects are also facing extinction.

North of the German-Danish border North Frisian was spoken only in some marsh-farms, located directly at the border.

===Self-designation===
Due to the large number of dialects there is no original native name for the North Frisian language as such. E.g. the Wiedingharde and Halligen Frisians call their language , in the Bökingharde it is called , and in the Goesharde likewise or . While these names all translate to &quot;Frisian&quot; the native names of the insular dialects refer to the particular islands as in &quot;Fering&quot;, &quot;Öömrang&quot;, &quot;Söl&#x27;ring&quot; or &quot;Halunder&quot;. E.g. &quot;Frisian&quot; would mean &quot;fresk&quot; in the Föhr dialect.

The North Frisians eventually agreed upon the inter-dialectal name &quot;friisk&quot; which corresponds to the West Frisian native name &quot;frysk&quot;. This designation is today mostly used when the North Frisian collectivity is addressed or in the names of official institutions such as Nordfriisk Instituut, Friisk Foriining or Friisk Gesäts. The northern section of the Interfrisian Council has however kept its name &quot;Frasche Rädj&quot; in the Mooring dialect.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
*
*The Föhr (Weesdring) dialect contrasts dental /, , , , , / with alveolar /, , , , , /.
*// is replaced with a non-sibilant sound // in the Sylt dialect.
*The alveolar trill // is replaced with the uvular // in the Bökingharde (Mooring) dialect.

===Vowels===


* One triphthong sound // only occurs in the Föhr dialect.
* // and // do not occur in the Bökingharde (mainland) dialect.
* // and // only occur in the Föhr dialect.
* //, //, //, and // only occur in the Bökingharde dialect.

Despite the strong differences among the North Frisian dialects, there are still some traits of phonology that are more or less common to all dialects. Among them is the lowering from to , which is mostly complete in the central dialects but is only at the stage or in the periphery. For example, the word &quot;fish&quot; translates to Mooring and Fering-Öömrang but Söl&#x27;ring (cf. Low German: , , , ).

The distribution of the lenition of the unvoiced plosives &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot; is similar as they have become voiced plosives and partially even developed to fricatives in the central dialects. That can be demonstrated from the verb &quot;to know&quot;: Mooring , Fering-Öömrang , Sölring , Halunder (cf. West Frisian , Low German , German ).

The North Frisian dialects differ from modern Standard German by a more diverse system of diphthongs and consonants. All of the dialects have an additional line of palatalizations, which is uncommon for a Germanic language. Until recently, an additional number of dental consonants contrasted phonemically with their alveolar counterparts in the dialect of Föhr. In general, the insular dialects feature a relatively complicated consonantal system, but the mainland dialects have more diverse vowels.

Recently, the phonological system of the North Frisian dialects has been strongly influenced by Standard German and is slowly adapting to its system.

==Current situation==
Officially, the number of North Frisian speakers ranges from 8,000 to 10,000 but linguists propose significantly lower numbers. In 2007, Århammar estimated a total of 5,000 speakers inside and 1,500 to 2,000 speakers outside North Frisia proper. Exact surveys do not exist.

North Frisian is an endangered language, as in most places, children no longer learn it. In UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot;, North Frisian is classified as &quot;severely endangered&quot;. Exceptions are a few villages on the islands of Föhr and Amrum and the Risum-Lindholm area. Especially in the western parts of Föhr, the language community is still relatively common. The number of speakers on Föhr and Amrum alone is estimated to around 3,500. The other dialects are, in fact, seriously endangered, like Karrharde Frisian, Central Goesharde and Halligen Frisian.

The elementary and grammar school on Amrum is called &quot;Öömrang Skuul&quot; and, among other subjects, focuses on teaching the local dialect. Fering is also taught in schools on Föhr and the &quot;Risum Skole/Risem Schölj&quot; in Risum-Lindholm on the mainland is a combined Danish-North Frisian elementary school.

All speakers of North Frisian are at least bilingual (North Frisian and German). Many are trilingual (North Frisian, German and Low German) and, especially along the Danish border, quadrilingualism used to be widespread (North Frisian, Standard German, Low German and South Jutlandic).

In Schleswig-Holstein, North Frisian is protected by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages as a minority language. On 24 December 2004 a state law became effective in Schleswig-Holstein that recognises the North Frisian language for official use in the Nordfriesland district and on Heligoland.

<doc id="547374" wikidata="Q1284782" url="?curid=547374" title="Wawa, Ontario">
<text>Wawa is a township in the Canadian province of Ontario in the Algoma District. Formerly known as the Township of Michipicoten, named after a nearby river of that name, the township was officially renamed in 2007 for its largest and best-known community of Wawa, located on the western shores of Wawa Lake.

This area was first developed for fur trading. In the late 19th century, both gold and iron ore were found and mined, leading to the region&#x27;s rise as the steel industry developed in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. From 1900 to 1918 the Helen Mine had the highest production of iron ore of any mine in Canada.

==History==

===Fur trade days===
Fort Michipicoten was constructed at the mouth of the Michipicoten River. It was at the junction of the main fur trade route from Montreal westward and the route to James Bay via the Missinaibi River.

French explorers reached the area by the mid 17th century, and a post was built early in the next century. The site was on the south bank of the river, opposite the mouth of the Magpie River. By 1729, it was an outpost of Fort Kaministiquia under command of Vérendrye&#x27;s &quot;Postes du Nord&quot;. When the British conquered Canada in 1763, this post was abandoned.

Four years later, it was re-opened on the same site by fur traders Alexander Henry the elder and Jean Baptiste Cadotte. The route from James Bay was explored by Edward Jarvis (1775) and Philip Turnor (1781). In 1783, it was taken over by the North West Company, based in Montreal. In 1797, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company built a rival post on the north bank.
With the union of the two companies in 1821, the Lake Superior trade was diverted from Montreal to Hudson Bay via Michipicoten. From 1827, the fort was the headquarters of the Superior Division, and several annual meetings were held here. It was a centre for fishing, boatbuilding and small-scale manufacture and repair. It also served as a base for missionaries and surveyors. This lasted until 1863, when the arrival of steamboats and railways made it unnecessary. It was closed in 1904 and gradually taken apart. In 1982, the site became the Michipicoten Provincial Park.

===Modern===
Mining attempts began as early as the late 1660s.

William Teddy discovered gold on Wawa Lake in 1897. The population of Wawa village quickly grew with 1,700 claims staked in 1898. However, most gold production stopped by 1906. Beginning in 1914 with the completion of the Algoma Central Railway, gold production commenced again from 22 prospects.

In 1898, the town site at what is now called &quot;the Mission&quot; was registered as &quot;Michipicoten City.&quot; In 1899, Wawa was surveyed and plotted as a town and registered as Wawa City. In the latter half of the 1950s, the town&#x27;s name was temporarily changed to Jamestown in honour of Sir James Hamet Dunn, but it was later returned to Wawa at the request of the community&#x27;s residents.

Gold production had slowed by 1906, but as mining technology improved, additional amounts began to be extracted from the area. Gold mining in the Wawa area prospered and receded several times in the 20th century, and it continues today. Notable producers include the Grace Mine (1902–1944), which produced 15,191 ounces, the Minto Mine (1929–1942), which produced 37,678 ounces, the Parkhill Mine (1902–1944), which produced 54,301 ounces, and the Renabie Mine (1920–1991), which produced 1.1 million ounces.

Iron ore extraction has also been an important industry in the area. The search for gold during the Michipicoten boom led to the unexpected discovery in 1897 of iron ore. Francis Hector Clergue, an American entrepreneur, immediately recognized the iron ore for its potential; he established a steel company at Sault Ste. Marie. Wawa was served by the Algoma Central Railway to ship ore for processing.

The first supply of ore extracted from the Helen Mine was shipped to Midland, Ontario, in July 1900; this was the &quot;first boat shipment of Canadian iron ore to a Canadian port.&quot; The mine produced high-grade iron ore until 1903, when operations shut down due to financial difficulties encountered by Clergue and his company. By 1904, the mine had returned to full production capabilities and was mining one thousand tons of hematite ore a day. From 1900 to 1918, the Helen Mine had the largest production of any iron mine in Canada.

In 1909, a second hematite ore deposit was uncovered near the Magpie River, twelve miles north of the Helen Mine. The Algoma Steel Corporation, organized between 1904 and 1909 in Sault Ste. Marie, bought up the claims and operated both the Magpie and Helen mines for the next decade. The Helen Mine continued ore production until 1918, when the company felt the reserve of hematite ore was finally depleted. The same fate followed the Magpie Mine in 1921. The Census of Canada records that the population of the Michipicoten region in 1921 experienced a drop from 1,001 in 1911 to 101 just ten years later.

It was not until 1937, with the threat of war in Europe and the emergence of a profitable market for Canadian iron ore, that the Helen Mine was reopened. A sintering plant was constructed on the northern bank of the Magpie River, two miles west of the mine. It was used to treat the siderite ore before it was shipped to the blast furnaces at Algoma Steel in Sault Ste. Marie. The plant became the centre for a small community called Sinterville, composed of workers and their families.

The Helen Mine remained an open pit operation until 1950, from which point on all production came from underground mining. In 1960, the new George W. MacLeod Mine went into production adjacent to the Helen Mine. The ore was transported on an aerial tramline that consisted of over 280 steel three-ton buckets traveling underground and then emerging three-quarters of a mile west of the 2,066-foot vertical MacLeod Shaft. The tramline continued the remaining two miles to the sinter plant on overhead cables. This system was replaced in 1979 by the latest in underground mining technology, the highest-lift single-drive conveyor in the world.

During the summer of 1971, Wawa hosted an archaeological field camp known as the Wawa Drop-In Project or the Big Dig, for young hitchhikers traveling along Highway 17. The project was directed by Professor K.C.A. Dawson and supported by the federal government as part of its youth employment program. The results of this fieldwork at several important sites were never published. The records are currently held by the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa.

Throughout the 1990s, Wawa and the Algoma Ore Division continued to be challenged by international market problems that plagued both the gold and iron mining industries. In December 1997, Algoma Steel announced that it could no longer support the high cost of extracting low-grade iron at Algoma Ore Division. Although Wawa&#x27;s mountain of iron ore had more to give, operations were shut down in June 1998, one hundred years after iron was first discovered in this remote corner of northern Algoma.

Wawa suffered a population decline after the closures of Helen Mine and the sinter plant. Its main industries have been forestry and tourism. In recent years, diamond prospecting and proposals to create a trap rock mine on the shore of Lake Superior have been developed; however, no mining activities of any kind have yet been established.

In October 2007 Weyerhauser, which operated an oriented strandboard mill 30 kilometres east of the town, announced an indefinite shutdown of its mill. The final production shift ran at the end of December 2007. Given low demand for wood products, the likelihood of the mill reopening was marginal at best. Since the shutdown, Wawa&#x27;s economy has suffered a near complete collapse, as the closure resulted in over 135 lost jobs, and more residents left the area. This has had a spinoff effect on other businesses and on the town&#x27;s population. It peaked at close to 5,600 in the 1990s but has since dropped to under 3,000, according to the 2011 Canadian census.

The collapse of the forestry industry in the first decade of the 2000s also adversely affected the neighbouring communities of Dubreuilville and White River. Wawa, the area&#x27;s largest settlement, has faced difficulties in attracting new industry to the community and region.

== Geography ==

The township includes the main population centre of Wawa, as well as the smaller communities of Michipicoten and Michipicoten River, which are small coastal settlements on the shore of Lake Superior. These names are derived from the Ojibwe term for the river.

===Climate===
Wawa has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) that is significantly moderated by Lake Superior. Winters are cold and snowy with a January high of and a low of and temperatures below occur 45 days per year. Snowfall totals are heavy, averaging over due to lake effect snow from Lake Superior as cold air from the northwest passes over the warmer lake. Summers are cool and mild due to cool, dry air masses from the northwest and the cooling of warm air from the south as it passes Lake Superior. As a result, temperatures above are rare. August is the warmest month with a high of and a low of , showing a slight seasonal lag. The average annual precipitation is , which is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year though the months of July to October see a peak in precipitation.
== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Wawa had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Tourism and attractions==

The community is known for its 8.5-metre (28-foot) metal statue of a Canada goose, which was built in 1960, and dedicated to the community in 1961. Wawa takes its name from the Ojibwe word for &quot;wild goose&quot;, &quot;wewe&quot;. Wawa was defined as wild goose in &quot;The Song of Hiawatha.&quot; On July 5, 2010, Canada Post made a commemorative stamp of the Wawa Goose as part of its Roadside Attractions collection. On July 1, 2017, a new Wawa Goose was unveiled to replace the second aging goose.

The town is also known for snowmobiling and sport fishing. The Voyageur Hiking Trail passes through the town. One notable shopping location is Young&#x27;s General Store, home of the locally famous Pickle Barrel.

==Politics==
The municipal council is composed of one mayor and four councillors. The current mayor is Melanie Pilon. Councillors Cathy Cannon, Micheline Hatfield, Joseph Opato and Jim Hoffmann were elected on October 24, 2022, for a four-year term.

==Transportation==
Highway 17, the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway, passes through the township, although the primary townsite is located on Highway 101, east of the junction with Highway 17. Sault Ste. Marie is located to the south. Lake Superior Provincial Park is located just south of the town.

In October 2012, the town was forced to declare a state of emergency after severe flooding washed out several roads within the municipality, including sections of both Highway 17 and Highway 101.

Wawa is located west of Canadian National Railway&#x27;s Hawk Junction station on the rail line from Sault Ste. Marie to Hearst. The line, formerly known as the Algoma Central Railway, provides tourist operations, as well as passenger and freight service to communities in northern Ontario.

A dial-in/demand response transit system has been available since February 2006. The service is provided by a single bus that can accommodate 12 passengers plus up to two wheelchairs.

Wawa has Ontario Northland motor coach service on its Sault Ste. MarieThunder Bay route.

==Education==
Wawa is home to English and French language schools. The Algoma District School Board is responsible for offering English language instruction and operates Sir James Dunn Public School, offering kindergarten to Grade 8 classes, while Michipicoten High School offers Grades 9 to 12. The Huron-Superior Catholic District School Board provides French immersion language instruction for junior kindergarten to Grade 7 at St. Joseph French Immersion School. In the 2014–2015 school year St. Joseph School will expand its French immersion program to include Grade 8.

Exclusive French-language instruction is offered by two school boards. According to the 2011 Census, 19% of Wawa&#x27;s population claimed French as their mother tongue. The Conseil scolaire du Grand Nord offers public school instruction at École publique l&#x27;Escalade for students in kindergarten to Grade 8. The Conseil scolaire catholique du Nouvel-Ontario offers Catholic instruction at École élémentaire et secondaire catholique St-Joseph.

<text>Along Came Polly is a 2004 American romantic comedy film written and directed by John Hamburg and starring Ben Stiller and Jennifer Aniston alongside Philip Seymour Hoffman, Debra Messing, Hank Azaria, Bryan Brown and Alec Baldwin. The story follows Reuben Feffer who finds his life taking a different turn when he reconnects and falls in love with his old classmate, Polly. Chaos ensues when his former wife, Lisa, returns to reconcile with him. The film was released on January 16, 2004. It received mixed reviews and grossed $178 million worldwide.

==Plot==
Reuben Feffer, a risk-averse actuary for a large life insurance company, is celebrating his honeymoon with his new wife, Lisa Kramer, on the island of St. Barts, but catches her having sex with Claude, a French scuba instructor. Lisa claims to be in love with Claude and chooses to stay in St. Barts with him. Reuben returns home to New York alone and attempts to piece his life back together. While at an art gallery with his friend, Sandy Lyle, he runs into former middle school classmate Polly Prince.

Reuben asks Polly out and she invites him to dinner at a Moroccan restaurant, which he agrees to despite having irritable bowel syndrome. The date ends badly when Reuben clogs Polly&#x27;s toilet, but she gives him a second chance, and the two go salsa dancing together. Polly dances provocatively with her friend Javier, and Reuben admits to being uncomfortable, explaining that he actually hates spicy food and generally avoids &quot;risky&quot; behaviors that she clearly enjoys. Despite this, Polly takes him home and they have sex.

Polly and Reuben continue to see each other regularly, and Reuben finds himself challenged by Polly to experience new things as well as by Leland Van Lew, an adventurous CEO who wants Reuben&#x27;s company to insure him so that he can maintain control of his company. Reuben also asks Javier to teach him to dance salsa, which allows him to surprise and charm Polly when they return to the salsa club.

When Lisa returns hoping to reconcile with Reuben, Polly is spooked by Reuben referring to her as his girlfriend. Reuben is torn between the free-spirited but noncommittal Polly and the safe and familiar Lisa. He enters information about them both into a computer insurance program which measures risk but tilts the program toward Polly. The computer tells him that, despite his numerous blunders with her, she is the least risky choice for Reuben.

Van Lew brings Reuben and Polly along on a sailing trip. As the two take shelter below deck during a storm, Polly discovers the risk assessment and argues with Reuben. She rejects his proposal to move in together, telling him that he would be better off going back to Lisa.

Back home, Reuben is despondent over losing Polly and invites Lisa to Sandy&#x27;s opening show, where he learns that Polly is leaving New York in a few hours and at the same time is urgently called into work to give his risk analysis presentation on Van Lew.

After a speech given by his father, Irving, to Sandy about not living in the past, Reuben realizes he wants to be with Polly and not Lisa, and he rushes to her apartment to stop her from leaving. Meanwhile, Sandy fills in for Reuben for his risk analysis presentation on Leland and successfully convinces the board to insure him.

Reuben catches up with Polly and tries to persuade her to stay. She still isn&#x27;t sure they&#x27;re compatible, so he eats food off the ground to prove he is capable of taking risks. Polly is finally convinced and ends up dating Reuben, but they both agree they will take their relationship step-by-step and not rush into marriage.

A year later, Reuben and Polly vacation on the same beach in St. Bart&#x27;s. He has loosened up more, while Polly has become more comfortable with commitment. They encounter Claude, but instead of being angry, he thanks him for setting off the course of events that led him here before heading nude into the water with Polly to join Leland on his new boat.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Along Came Polly&quot; opened at #1 at the box office in the United States, earning US$27,721,185 in its opening weekend, ending the month-long reign of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. The film was released in the United Kingdom on February 27, 2004, and topped the country&#x27;s box office for the next two weekends. The film was a financial success, making $178 million at the box office worldwide off a $42 million budget.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 27% based on 163 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Though the supporting actors are funny, Stiller and Aniston don&#x27;t make a believable couple, and the gross-out humor is gratuitous.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 44 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<doc id="547380" wikidata="Q2424330" url="?curid=547380" title="Thomas Greenway">
<text>Thomas Greenway (25 March 1838 – 30 October 1908) was a Canadian politician, merchant and farmer. He served as the seventh premier of Manitoba from 1888 to 1900. A Liberal, his ministry formally ended Manitoba&#x27;s non-partisan government, although a &quot;de facto&quot; two-party system had existed for some years.

==Early life==
Greenway was born in Kilkhampton, UK, emigrating to Canada with his family in 1846. He was a Methodist in religion. His eldest child John Wesley Greenway was born on 27 August 1861. Greenway moved his family west in 1878 to a 1000-acre stead in Manitoba.

==Political career==
Greenway began his political career in Ontario, contesting Huron South for the Conservative Party in 1872. He narrowly lost to Liberal candidate Malcolm Colin Cameron, and suffered the same result in 1874. Cameron&#x27;s 1874 victory was overturned for illegal campaign activities, however, and Greenway was elected unopposed the following year. He entered parliament as an &quot;Independent Conservative&quot;, in opposition to Alexander Mackenzie&#x27;s Liberal government. He was also an active Methodist lay preacher.

Greenway&#x27;s affiliation with the Conservative Party was always tenuous. He opposed protectionism, and in 1876 voted for the budget of Liberal Finance Minister Richard John Cartwright. He generally favour the Liberals for the remainder of his time in parliament (though continuing to sit as an Independent), and stood aside in favour of Cameron in 1878.

Greenway moved to Manitoba in 1879, having acquired a large tract of land in the province&#x27;s southwestern corner (with financial backing from Cameron). He was the founder of Crystal City, Manitoba. When a provincial election was held on 16 December of that year, he was elected unopposed in the riding of Mountain. Greenway again referred to himself as an &quot;Independent Conservative&quot;, and sought to represent his constituents in the manner of an independent country politician; however, he soon became known as a leading opponent of John Norquay&#x27;s government.

When Prime Minister John A. Macdonald disallowed Manitoba&#x27;s local railway legislation in 1882, Greenway formed an opposition group known as the Provincial Rights Party, which ran 15 candidates in the provincial election of 1883. Although it did not achieve immediate success (Norquay&#x27;s government won 21 of 30 seats), it emerged as the most powerful voice on the opposition side. Greenway had to fend off a personal challenge from premier Norquay, who ran as a candidate in Mountain as well as his own riding of St. Andrew&#x27;s. If Norquay hoped to silence the strongest opposition voice by this tactic, he was unsuccessful: Greenway won the riding by 330 votes to 244.

The Provincial Rights group subsequently consolidated the non-government MLAs into the Manitoba Liberal Party — rather to the chagrin of some Winnipeg Liberals, who were suspicious of Greenway&#x27;s rural base. Some ex-parliamentary &quot;Provincial Rights&quot; groups merged in the same period. These faded away after a few public protests, but Greenway&#x27;s control over the provincial Liberal organization soon became unchallengeable.

The Liberals believed they had a chance to win the provincial election of 1886, and in fact, received about as many votes as Norquay&#x27;s Conservatives. A personal visit from John A. Macdonald boosted Conservative strength, however, and Norquay&#x27;s government won roughly 21 seats compared to 14 for the opposition. Greenway himself faced a surprisingly strong challenge in Mountain, defeating Conservative candidate R. Rogers by 385 votes to 370.

===Premier of Manitoba===

Norquay was unable to maintain his alliance with John A. McDonald and resigned after losing the support of his ministers in December 1887. When his successor David Howard Harrison proved unable to command a parliamentary majority, Greenway was asked by the Lieutenant Governor to form a new administration in January 1888. Through by-election wins and defections, he was able to sustain a stable administration before calling new elections in mid-year.

Greenway&#x27;s Liberal administration was tolerated by John A. Macdonald, who once claimed in private correspondence that he preferred Greenway to Norquay. The Premier&#x27;s commitment to &quot;liberalism&quot; in the Canadian context was no stronger than his commitment to &quot;conservatism&quot; ten years earlier. As an administrator, he remained an independent figure unbothered by questions of ideology. Perhaps the only thing that Greenway unambiguously stood for in 1888 was provincial railway rights: when he assumed power, he promised to be more successful in securing these rights than the Norquay administration had been.

Greenway was extremely fortunate, in this sense, that his term began just as the Canadian Pacific Railway voluntarily ended its provincial monopoly over rail travel, subject to hefty compensation from the federal government. He rode a wave of popular support to a landslide election victory in the 1888 campaign, taking 33 seats against 5 for the Conservatives. No Conservative even challenged Greenway in Mountain.

Greenway, however, was unable to resolve the railway issue. His administration mishandled negotiations for a new connection to the United States, and the CPR&#x27;s continued to dominate the region. Transportation rates remained high, and provincial development suffered accordingly. One of Greenway&#x27;s legislative supporters, Rodmond Palen Roblin, bolted to the Conservative opposition in disgust.

After failing in railway reform, Greenway turned his attention to education. His controversial reforms of Manitoba&#x27;s school system provoked a national crisis in the 1890s, and are still regarded as his administration&#x27;s most notable accomplishment.

When Manitoba was created in 1870, the provincial government established a dual school system to reflect the province&#x27;s demographic balance. The Manitoba Act of 1870 and School Act of 1871 provided for separate and equally funded Catholic and Protestant school boards. These boards were divided by language as well as religion: the province&#x27;s original Catholic population was predominantly francophone, while its Protestant population was almost exclusively anglophone.

The demographics of Manitoba changed considerably between 1870 and 1888. Protestants came to outnumber Catholics by a significant margin, and the dual system was regarded by many new settlers as an anachronism. Many anglophones, both Conservative and Liberal, resented the continued state funding for French-language education. Greenway sought to appeal to these voters in 1890 by abolishing the dual system and setting up a single Department of Education. Also in 1890, Greenway&#x27;s Liberals enacted legislation to unilaterally abolish the province&#x27;s obligation to ensure all its law were bilingual, doing away with French-language legislation. This was declared illegal by two lower court decisions, which the Province ignored. In 1984, the federal Government referred the question to the Supreme Court of Canada, which held Greenway&#x27;s actions had been unconstitutional. The Court forced Manitoba to translate all its legislation into French, a job that took seven years to complete.

Under Greenways&#x27;s anti-French and anti-Catholic education legislation of 1890, while Catholic schools were allowed, but they were denied state funding; parents who sent their children to Catholic schools were required to contribute to their secular board as well. These reforms were popular with Protestants, particularly among the evangelical faiths. Greenway&#x27;s government was re-elected in the 1892 election, winning 28 seats to approximately 12 for the opposition. Greenway personally defeated Rogers for the second time in Mountain.

This election did not bring an end to the education issue. Greenway&#x27;s legislation brought about a complex series of legal cases, as well as threats of disallowance from various levels of government. The resulting controversy (known as the Manitoba Schools Question) dominated Canadian politics in the mid-1890s, and divided both the Conservatives and Liberals on the national level.

In 1895, after the Privy Council refused to decide the matter, Conservative Prime Minister Mackenzie Bowell passed remedial legislation defending Catholic rights. Greenway responded by calling another election and again presented himself as the champion of provincial rights against federal intrusion. The result, on 15 January 1896, was another Liberal landslide victory — Greenway&#x27;s Liberals won 31 seats, compared with 6 for the still-leaderless Conservatives (the Patrons of Industry, an upstart third party, were sidelined by the education controversy and won only 2 seats). These results were a significant blow to the federal Conservatives, who soon withdrew their remedial legislation. Bowell stood aside as national Conservative leader, leaving a weakened and badly divided party in his wake.

Shortly thereafter, the federal Liberals under Wilfrid Laurier won a national election, and resolved the Schools Questions with a mild compromise (providing minimal state support for Catholic and French education on a case-by-case basis). Greenway&#x27;s efforts to introduce secular education into the province were successful, and the Laurier government&#x27;s bid for further concessions in later years came to nothing.

The resolution of the education issue did not benefit Greenway&#x27;s chances for re-election, however. No longer able to benefit from protest votes, the Liberals were defeated by the Conservatives under Hugh John Macdonald (son of the former Prime Minister) in late 1899. Many voters were apprehensive about recent East European immigration into the province, and were offended by even the minor concessions which Greenway had made on the education question; the Conservative Party was able to tap into this xenophobia, and won 22 seats out of 40. Greenway reluctantly returned to the leadership of the opposition, and sought a patronage appointment to cap off his career. An attempt for an early Senate promotion came to nothing, and he continued to lead the Liberals in a desultory fashion through the election of 1903 (wherein his party won only 9 of 40 seats).

===Post-premiership, federal politics, and death===

Greenway returned to federal politics in 1904, winning election for the Manitoba riding of Lisgar. Although his loyalty to the Liberal Party was now unquestioned, he accomplished very little in Ottawa and continued to spend most of his time seeking out a comfortable sinecure. In 1908, he finally received an appointment to the expanded Board of Railway Commissioners. However, he suffered a fatal heart attack on the day that he was scheduled to be sworn in.

==Legacy==

Greenway remained a controversial figure for much of the twentieth century. Some regarded his education reforms as discriminatory toward minority groups; others (including some in the social gospel and secular left) saw him as a champion of the public school system in western Canada. Since the rise of official bilingualism in the 1960s, Greenway&#x27;s reputation has fallen somewhat.

Notwithstanding this, Greenway was certainly responsible for bringing a mature party system into Manitoba politics. Following his departure from the provincial scene, no one doubted that partisan politics had become an established part of Manitoba&#x27;s cultural landscape.

<text>The Central Siberian Plateau (; ) is a vast mountainous area in Siberia, one of the Great Russian Regions.

==Geography==
The plateau occupies a great part of central Siberia between the Yenisei and Lena rivers. It is located in the Siberian Platform and extends over an area of , between the Yenisei in the west and the Central Yakutian Lowland in the east. To the south it is bound by the Altai Mountains, Salair Ridge, Kuznetsk Alatau, the Eastern and Western Sayan Mountains and other mountains of Tuva, as well as the North Baikal Highlands and Baikal Mountains. To the north of the plateau lie the North Siberian Lowland and to the east the plateau gives way to the Central Yakutian Lowland and the Lena Plateau.

The surface of the Central Siberian Plateau is characterized by the alternation of wide plateaus and ridges, some of the latter sharply jagged. The Central Siberian Plateau covers one-third of Siberia. 

===Subplateaus and subranges===
The system of the Central Siberian Plateau comprises a number of smaller plateaus and subranges, including, among others, the following:

*Putorana Plateau, the northwesternmost, highest point Mount Kamen (highest of the plateau system) 
*Anabar Plateau at the northern end, highest point 
*Vilyuy Plateau, highest point 
*Syverma Plateau, highest point Nakson, 
*Tunguska Plateau, highest point 
*Lena Plateau, highest point 
*Lena-Angara Plateau, highest point Namai, 
*Yenisei Range, highest point 
*Angara Range, highest point 

==Climate==
The climate is continental with short warm summers and long and severely cold winters. Most of the territory is covered with conifer forests (larch is especially abundant). The plateau&#x27;s major river is the Lower Tunguska. Known geologically as the Siberian Traps, mineral resources here are very rich and include coal, iron ore, gold, platinum, diamonds and natural gas.

<doc id="547384" wikidata="Q459830" url="?curid=547384" title="Steven Gerrard">
<text>Steven George Gerrard (born 30 May 1980) is an English professional football manager and former player. Widely regarded as one of Liverpool&#x27;s greatest ever players and also as one of the greatest midfielders of all time, Gerrard spent the majority of his playing career as a central midfielder for Liverpool and the England national team. Gerrard has captained both Liverpool and the England national team.

Born in Merseyside, Gerrard played for his local club Liverpool for most of his professional career, from 1998 to 2015; here he won nine trophies, including one UEFA Champions League (2005), two FA Cups and three League Cups. He was Man of the Match in the 2005 UEFA Champions League final, in which Liverpool overturned a 3–0 deficit to defeat AC Milan on penalties, and the 2006 FA Cup final, which has been termed &quot;The Gerrard Final&quot; in homage to his performance. Despite success in cup competitions, he never won the Premier League. Gerrard won 114 England caps between 2000 and 2014, captaining the team 38 times and scoring 21 goals. He played at three UEFA European Championships, in 2000, 2004 and 2012 (where he was named in the Team of the Tournament) and three FIFA World Cups, in 2006, 2010 and 2014. He spent two years at Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy and retired in 2016.

Gerrard began his managerial career managing the Liverpool Youth Academy&#x27;s under-18 team, before starting his senior managerial career in 2018 with Scottish Premiership club Rangers. In his third full season in charge, Gerrard&#x27;s side went unbeaten in the league to win Rangers&#x27; first league title in ten years. In November 2021, he became the manager of Aston Villa, but after just eleven months in charge, he was dismissed due to a poor run of results.

As a player, his individual awards include UEFA Club Footballer of the Year in 2005, PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year in 2006, FWA Footballer of the Year in 2009, appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2007 and induction into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021. He was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year a record eight times. As a manager, he was named as Manager of the Year for 2021 by PFA Scotland and the SFWA.

==Early life==
Steven George Gerrard was born on 30 May 1980 at Whiston Hospital in Whiston, Merseyside, the second son of Julie Ann and Paul Gerrard. He started out playing for his hometown team, Whiston Juniors, where he was noticed by Liverpool scouts; he joined the Liverpool Academy in 1989, aged nine. His childhood football heroes were Liverpool&#x27;s John Barnes and Ian Rush and England&#x27;s Paul Gascoigne. As a child, he suffered an incident in which a garden fork was embedded in the big toe of his right foot; later, in his autobiography, he credited his father and Liverpool Academy director Steve Heighway for preventing unnecessary surgery to amputate his toe.

Despite not being a Catholic and living outside the school&#x27;s catchment area, Gerrard attended Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School in Liverpool&#x27;s West Derby suburb after it was recommended by his primary school teacher (whose husband was a PE teacher there) due to its superior football reputation over other schools in the area. He had trials with various clubs at age 14, but his success was not immediate and he never made it into the England schoolboys&#x27; team. His trials included one with Manchester United, which he admitted in his autobiography was solely &quot;to pressure Liverpool into giving [him] a Youth Training Scheme contract&quot;. He signed his first professional contract with Liverpool on 5 November 1997.

==Club career==

===Liverpool===
====1998–2004: Beginnings, cup treble and club captaincy====
Gerrard made his first-team debut for Liverpool on 29 November 1998 as a late substitute in a Premier League match against Blackburn Rovers. He made thirteen appearances in his debut season, replacing injured captain Jamie Redknapp in central midfield. He also occasionally played on the right wing, but scarcely contributed in the short match time he received, which he attributed to nerves. Gerrard recalled in a 2008 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;I was out of position and out of my depth.&quot; Nonetheless, Liverpool&#x27;s coaching staff remained convinced that he would improve. Gerrard saw himself as a defensive player primarily, looking to make key tackles rather than push the team forward.

Replacing Paul Ince, Gerrard regularly partnered Redknapp in midfield for the 1999–2000 season. After starting the Merseyside derby on the bench, he replaced Robbie Fowler in the second half, receiving his first career red card for a challenge to the upper leg of Everton&#x27;s Kevin Campbell. Later that season, Gerrard scored his first senior goal in a 4–1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday. However, he began to suffer from persistent back problems, which sports consultant Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt later diagnosed as a result of accelerated growth, coupled with excessive playing, during his teenage years. He was then beset by groin injuries that required four separate operations.

In the 2000–01 season, Gerrard made fifty starts in all competitions, scoring ten goals. That season, he won his first major honours with Liverpool—the FA Cup, Football League Cup, and the UEFA Cup—scoring in the final of the last competition. He was named PFA Young Player of the Year by his peers. The following season, he won the UEFA Super Cup, but missed the 2001 FA Charity Shield through injury. In March 2003, Gerrard scored the opening goal in the club&#x27;s 2–0 win over Manchester United in the Football League Cup final, held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. After a year as vice-captain, Gerrard replaced Sami Hyypiä as Liverpool captain in October 2003. Manager Gérard Houllier said that he had recognised Gerrard&#x27;s leadership qualities early on, but that he needed time to mature.

In June 2005, Gerrard extended his contract at the club, signing a four-year deal. Houllier resigned as Liverpool manager after a trophy-less 2003–04 campaign, and Gerrard was linked with a move to Chelsea during the off-season. Gerrard admitted that he was not &quot;happy with the progress Liverpool has made&quot;, and that &quot;for the first time in my career I&#x27;ve thought about the possibility of moving on.&quot; Ultimately, Gerrard turned down a £20 million offer from Chelsea, staying with Liverpool under new coach Rafael Benítez.

====2004–2007: Champions League and FA Cup success====
Liverpool had many injuries early in the 2004–05 season, and a broken toe suffered in a September league match against Manchester United sidelined Gerrard until late November. On 8 December, Gerrard scored a crucial 25-yard half volley in the 86th minute of Liverpool&#x27;s final Champions League group stage match against Olympiacos to send the club through to the knockout round. A strike that saw Sky Sports co-commentator Andy Gray exclaim, &quot;Oh, you beauty!! What a hit son! What a hit!&quot;, Gerrard claimed that this was his most important, if not his best, goal for Liverpool to date. However, Gerrard netted an own goal during the 2005 League Cup final on 27 February, which proved decisive in Liverpool&#x27;s 3–2 loss to Chelsea after extra time at the Millennium Stadium.

During a six-minute stretch in the second half of the 2005 Champions League final against AC Milan, Liverpool came back from a three-goal deficit to tie the match at 3–3 after extra time; Gerrard scored the first for his side, a header from a John Arne Riise cross. Liverpool&#x27;s third goal was gained as a penalty from a foul awarded to Liverpool when Gennaro Gattuso was judged to have pulled down Gerrard in Milan&#x27;s penalty area. Xabi Alonso&#x27;s penalty was saved by Dida but the rebound was scored. Gerrard did not participate in the penalty shoot-out (he was the designated fifth penalty taker) which Liverpool won 3–2 as they claimed their first Champions League trophy in twenty years. Dubbed the &quot;Miracle of Istanbul&quot;, the match is widely regarded as one of the greatest finals in the competition&#x27;s history, and Gerrard was lauded as the catalyst for the second half comeback. Gerrard was named the Man of the Match, and later received the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year award.

In regards to his contract issues with Liverpool, Gerrard told the press after the final, &quot;How can I leave after a night like this?&quot; but negotiations soon stalled and on 5 July 2005, after Liverpool turned down another lucrative offer from Chelsea, Gerrard&#x27;s agent Struan Marshall informed Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry that Gerrard was rejecting a club-record £100,000-a-week offer. Parry conceded the club had lost Gerrard, saying, &quot;Now we have to move on. We have done our best, but he has made it clear he wants to go and I think it looks pretty final.&quot; The next day, Gerrard signed a new four-year deal as Parry blamed the earlier breakdown of talks on miscommunication between the two sides. Gerrard stated upon signing the contract that he would rather win one Premier League title with Liverpool than win multiple titles at Chelsea as it would mean more to him.

Gerrard scored 23 goals in 53 appearances in 2005–06, and in April became the first Liverpool player since John Barnes in 1988 to be voted the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year. He scored twice in the 2006 FA Cup final against West Ham United, including an injury time 35-yard equalizer that sent the match into extra time, and Liverpool won their second consecutive major trophy on penalties. A match called &quot;The Gerrard Final&quot;, the goals made him the only player to have scored in the FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Cup and Champions League finals. Liverpool eliminated Chelsea in the 2006–07 Champions League semi-finals on penalties, to return to their second final in three seasons, which they lost 2–1 to Milan in Athens.

====2007–2012: Continued success and stardom====
Gerrard suffered a toe fracture in an August 2007 Champions League qualifier against Toulouse, but returned four days later to play the entirety of a 1–1 league draw against Chelsea. On 28 October 2007, Gerrard played his 400th game for Liverpool in a league match against Arsenal, in which he scored. He scored in all but one of Liverpool&#x27;s domestic and European matches during the month of November, and after scoring the only goal in a Champions League away tie against Marseille on 11 December, he became the first Liverpool player since John Aldridge in 1989 to score in seven consecutive games in all competitions. In December 2007, Gerrard was voted sixth (after Kaká, Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Didier Drogba and Ronaldinho) for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year.

Gerrard made his 300th Premier League appearance on 13 April 2008 in a match against Blackburn Rovers, scoring the opening goal in a game which Liverpool won 3–1, and finished the season with twenty-one goals in all competitions, surpassing his total from the 2006–07 season. Gerrard was selected for the PFA Team of the Year and he was also one of the nominees or the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year, alongside teammate Fernando Torres.

Gerrard needed to undergo groin surgery at the beginning of the 2008–09 season, but the problem was not serious and he quickly returned to training. He scored what appeared to be his hundredth career Liverpool goal against Stoke City on 20 September, but it was disallowed after Dirk Kuyt was ruled offside. He achieved the milestone eleven days later in a 3–1 Champions League group stage win over PSV.

He made his 100th appearance in European club competition for Liverpool on 10 March 2009 against Real Madrid and scored twice in a 4–0 win. Four days later, when Liverpool faced Manchester United, Gerrard won a penalty after he had been fouled by Patrice Evra. With the scoreline at 1–1, Gerrard scored the resulting spot-kick, his first goal at Old Trafford, to give Liverpool the lead en route to a 4–1 victory. Following these results, three-time FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane hailed Gerrard as possibly the best player in the world. On 22 March 2009, Gerrard scored his first ever hat-trick in the Premier League, against Aston Villa, in a 5–0 victory.

On 13 May 2009, Gerrard was named as the 2009 Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year, beating Ryan Giggs by just 10 votes and becoming the first Liverpool player to win the award in nineteen years. Gerrard was delighted and &quot;a little bit surprised&quot; to win the award. On 5 December 2009, Gerrard made his 500th appearance for Liverpool at Blackburn. He ended the 2009–10 season with 12 goals and nine assists from 46 matches.

Following the 2009–10 season, Rafael Benítez departed Liverpool after six years and was succeeded as manager by Roy Hodgson, who quickly assured fans that Gerrard would not be sold. To further eliminate any speculation surrounding his future at the club, Gerrard made a statement emphasizing his excitement at the coming season with Liverpool and praising the signing of Joe Cole. Gerrard soon played his first pre-season match of the 2010–11 season against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 1 August 2010 alongside new signing Joe Cole.

Gerrard scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season from the penalty spot in a Europa League qualifier against Macedonian side FK Rabotnički on 5 August 2010. His next two goals came on 19 September at Old Trafford in a 3–2 loss against Manchester United; he scored from a penalty kick in the 64th minute and a free-kick six minutes later to level the game at 2–2. He followed this up one week later with the second equaliser in a 2–2 home draw with Sunderland. Eleven days later, Gerrard came off the bench to score a second-half hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Napoli in the Europa League.

Gerrard missed the start of the 2011–12 season due to a groin injury, which had also kept him out of action for large parts of the previous season. Gerrard later went on to reveal he rejected the chance to join Bayern Munich in the summer to focus on getting Liverpool back in the Champions League, saying &quot;... a traditional club like Liverpool still has a value, that&#x27;s the reason why I have stuck around for so long ... it is more important to win a couple of trophies and achieve something that is a lot more difficult than go down the easy road and move to a club where it becomes easier.&quot;

On 29 October, Gerrard underwent treatment to clear an infection in his right ankle, which was placed in a protective plaster cast. He was forced to miss Liverpool&#x27;s league match against West Bromwich Albion that day and was ruled out for at least the match against Swansea City the following week and England&#x27;s friendly matches against Sweden and Spain the week after that. On 30 December, Gerrard came off the bench against Newcastle United and scored a fine goal.

Gerrard went on to help Liverpool to reach their first cup final in 6 years, and their first at Wembley Stadium in 18 years, as Liverpool beat Manchester City 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals. Gerrard scored a penalty in both legs to send Liverpool to the 2012 Football League Cup final against Cardiff City on 26 February 2012, which Liverpool won on penalties. On his 400th Premier League appearance for Liverpool, Gerrard scored a hat-trick to give Liverpool a 3–0 victory over rivals Everton in the Merseyside derby on 13 March.

====2012–2015: Final seasons with Liverpool====

On 18 August 2012, Gerrard played his 250th match as Liverpool captain. He scored his first Premier League goal of the season on 23 September, opening the scoring in a 2–1 defeat against Manchester United.

On 15 July 2013, Gerrard signed a contract extension with Liverpool. On 3 August 2013, Liverpool played Olympiacos, against whom Gerrard scored arguably his most celebrated goal, at Anfield for Gerrard&#x27;s charity fund-raising testimonial match. Liverpool won the match 2–0, in a game where past players such as Jamie Carragher and Robbie Fowler made appearances. Alder Hey Children&#x27;s Charity, of which Gerrard is a founding partner, received £500,000 from the proceeds. On 5 October, Gerrard scored in a 3–1 win over Crystal Palace, becoming Liverpool&#x27;s first ever player to score in 15 successive league campaigns, overtaking the record previously set by Billy Liddell in 1959. Also in October 2013, he became the longest-serving Liverpool captain, 10 years after his appointment by Gérard Houllier on 15 October 2013, breaking the previous record held by Alex Raisbeck, who captained Liverpool from 1899 to 1909.

On 19 October 2013, Gerrard scored his 100th Premier League goal, a penalty against Newcastle United in a 2–2 draw. On 16 March 2014, Gerrard scored two penalties and missed another in Liverpool&#x27;s 3–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. With nine career goals against arch rivals Manchester United he is Liverpool&#x27;s highest goalscorer in the fixture. On 6 April, he scored another two penalties as Liverpool beat West Ham United 2–1 to go top of the Premier League table with five matches to play. These goals took him above Kenny Dalglish as Liverpool&#x27;s sixth-top goalscorer of all time.

On 27 April 2014, Gerrard was involved in what was later labelled as a defining moment of the 2013–14 Premier League season; where Liverpool would ultimately finish second. Liverpool originally topped the league when they faced Chelsea in their third last match of the season. Gerrard slipped while receiving a pass which allowed Demba Ba to score the opening goal for Chelsea; Chelsea went on to win 2–0, which meant that Liverpool&#x27;s title hopes were no longer in their own hands. Gerrard finished the season with 13 goals and the League&#x27;s most assists at 13. Gerrard was a nominee for the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award that year, while he won the 2014 Liverpool Echo Sports Personality Award. Gerrard would later refer to this period as &quot;the worst three months of my life&quot;.

In October 2014, Gerrard ruled out retiring at the end of the 2014–15 season and said that he could join another club if he were not offered a new contract at Liverpool. On 1 January 2015, Gerrard announced that he would leave Liverpool at the end of the season. Gerrard said he would have signed a new contract had it been offered in the offseason, but said the club did not make an offer until November. By that time, Brendan Rodgers had spoken to him about managing his playing time and he had been left out of the starting line-up against Real Madrid in the Champions League, contributing to his decision to leave Liverpool. His goal against Basel in the final group stage game of the Champions League was Gerrard&#x27;s 30th goal in the competition, a club record until it was surpassed by Mohamed Salah in 2021. On 5 January 2015, Gerrard scored two goals in his first game after announcing his departure in the FA Cup 3rd round tie in a 2–1 win at AFC Wimbledon. This followed another two-goal performance in the previous match against Leicester, the first time he scored two or more goals in consecutive games since July 2005. On 4 February 2015, he made his 700th appearance for Liverpool, in an FA Cup tie against Bolton.

On 22 March, Gerrard was sent off 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute in a match against Manchester United for stamping on Ander Herrera. Gerrard made his 500th league appearance for Liverpool in a goalless draw against West Brom on 25 April; he became only the third player ever to achieve 500 or more Premier League appearances for one club, after Ryan Giggs and former teammate Jamie Carragher. His final appearance for Liverpool at Anfield was on 16 May against Crystal Palace in a 3–1 loss. His final appearance for the club was eight days later in a 6–1 defeat at Stoke, with Gerrard scoring Liverpool&#x27;s only goal of the game.

===LA Galaxy: Final years and retirement===

On 7 January 2015, the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer (MLS) announced the signing of Gerrard to an 18-month Designated Player contract, reportedly worth $9 million. He joined the team in July, following the end of the 2014–15 Premier League season. On 11 July, Gerrard made his debut for LA, coming on at half time for Ignacio Maganto in a 1–0 loss at Real Salt Lake in the U.S. Open Cup quarter-finals. He made his MLS debut on 17 July, scoring once, while assisting one goal of his former Liverpool teammate Robbie Keane&#x27;s hat-trick, during a 5–2 defeat of fellow Californians the San Jose Earthquakes at the StubHub Center. That month, Gerrard was one of the 22 players to be named to the 2015 MLS All-Star Game roster. He made 13 appearances across the regular season, scoring one more goal, the team&#x27;s last of a 3–2 home win over FC Dallas on 27 September.

After the Galaxy were eliminated from the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs by Seattle Sounders FC, Gerrard announced that he may retire in 2016, saying that he found unexpected difficulty in the long journeys to away matches in the United States, and the diverse altitude and weather across the country.

Gerrard played his final game for the Galaxy on 6 November 2016 in a MLS Cup Playoff penalty shoot-out loss to Colorado Rapids. Gerrard took and scored Los Angeles&#x27; first spot-kick but the club were eliminated after Giovani dos Santos and Ashley Cole failed to convert. Nine days later, he stated he would be leaving on the expiration of his contract. He announced his retirement from professional football on 24 November, at age 36.

==International career==
===2000–2004: Beginnings and early call-ups===
Gerrard made his international debut against Ukraine on 31 May 2000. That summer, he was called up for UEFA Euro 2000, making only one appearance as a substitute in a 1–0 win over Germany before England were eliminated in the group stage. He scored his first international goal in the famous 5–1 victory over Germany in a 2002 World Cup qualifier in September 2001, and while England qualified, Gerrard was forced to pull out of the squad due to his ongoing groin problems after pulling up in Liverpool&#x27;s final match of the season against Ipswich.

===2004–2006: FIFA World Cup debut===
Gerrard scored his second goal for the national team in the Euro 2004 qualifier against Macedonia on 16 October 2002 in a 2–2 draw, his third goal was the opener in a 2–1 win over Serbia and Montenegro on 3 June 2003.

Before the Euros, Gerrard won the only trophy with the national team in his career – the friendly 2004 FA Summer Tournament.

He was a regular starter in Euro 2004, scoring once to make it 3–0 in England&#x27;s win over Switzerland in the second Group game of the tournament but England would be eliminated by the tournament hosts Portugal in the quarter-finals losing 6–5 on penalties in a match when Gerrard was substituted off in the 81st minute for Owen Hargreaves.

He participated in his first World Cup in 2006 and scored two goals, both in the group stage, against Trinidad and Tobago and Sweden, although his spot-kick was one of three saved by goalkeeper Ricardo as England again bowed out to Portugal in the quarter-finals on penalties. He was England&#x27;s top scorer in the tournament.

===2006–2010: Vice-captaincy and &quot;Golden Generation&quot;===
Gerrard was made vice-captain of the England team by coach Steve McClaren, and while he filled in for John Terry as captain, England suffered back-to-back losses to Russia and Croatia that ended their Euro 2008 qualifying hopes. After new coach Fabio Capello took over the team in early 2008, Gerrard was given a trial run as captain but Capello settled on Terry for the role. Gerrard was subsequently replaced as England vice-captain by Rio Ferdinand.

Gerrard helped England qualify for the 2010 World Cup, scoring two goals in England&#x27;s 5–1 win over Croatia. John Terry was replaced by Rio Ferdinand as captain in 2010, following revelations about the former&#x27;s private life, and Gerrard subsequently became vice-captain again. When the England team left for the 2010 World Cup, Gerrard was the most experienced player in the squad with 80 caps. During preparations for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, however, Rio Ferdinand was injured, meaning that Gerrard was appointed by Capello as captain for the tournament. During the tournament, he scored in England&#x27;s 1–1 draw against the USA, during the group stages of the tournament. Unfortunately, England exited the tournament with a 4–1 loss against Germany.

After the tournament Gerrard, part of a group of England players dubbed the &quot;Golden Generation&quot;, confirmed that he would continue to be available for selection, despite suggestions from Capello that he would seek to rebuild the team.

===2010–2014: Captaincy and international retirement===

In August 2010, Gerrard scored twice in a friendly match against Hungary and helped England to a 2–1 win. Due to Ferdinand&#x27;s continued absence through injury, Gerrard retained the captaincy for the opening match of the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign against Bulgaria, which England won 4–0. He was later named permanent captain by new coach Roy Hodgson, in time for the tournament finals.

This was the first time that he was named directly the captain of England and not in place of an injured or unavailable captain. He provided three assists and won two man of the match awards to help England finish top of their group at Euro 2012. Despite their quarter-final exit on penalties to Italy, Gerrard was later the only England player to be named in the UEFA Team of the Tournament. On 14 November 2012, Gerrard won his 100th cap for England in a friendly match against Sweden.

For the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Gerrard captained England to their first group stage elimination since 1958 and their first elimination after only two matches, after two straight 1–2 defeats against Italy and Uruguay. Gerrard had played a part in both goals conceded against Uruguay courtesy of his club-mate, Luis Suárez. For England&#x27;s final game against Costa Rica, Gerrard was replaced as captain by Frank Lampard and used as a substitute.

On 21 July 2014, Gerrard announced his retirement from international football. He represented England 114 times (currently the fourth most capped player), scoring 21 goals. Jordan Henderson described Gerrard as &quot;probably the best player this country has ever seen – not only as a player, but also as a leader and a captain.&quot;

==Style of play==
Regarded by several pundits and footballing figures as one of the greatest players of his generation, in 2009, Zinedine Zidane and Pelé considered Gerrard to be possibly the best footballer in the world. Known for his versatility and wide range of skills, he was capable of playing in many positions. A hardworking box-to-box player with great endurance, Gerrard was usually deployed as a central midfielder, but he had also been used as a second striker, a holding midfielder, an attacking midfielder, a right-back, and a right winger.

Gerrard began his professional career as a wide midfielder on the right, although he did not excel in this position as he had a tendency to commit careless fouls in his youth. Nevertheless, Liverpool retained their faith in the youngster, and he was later shifted to a defensive midfield position as he matured, where he excelled as a ball-winner rather than as a playmaker.

He continued to evolve tactically, coming into his own in a box-to-box central midfield role, which allowed him to be effective both offensively and defensively; indeed, at his peak, he was known for his ability to make late runs from behind into the penalty area. Under Benítez, he was also used in a supporting and creative role, as an attacking midfielder behind the strikers, or even as a deep-lying playmaker; he was increasingly deployed in the latter position in his later career, in order to compensate for his physical decline, and due to his ability to dictate play in midfield with his vision and passing range.

Besides that, Gerrard, naturally right footed, was able to score goals from distance due to his ball striking ability—he scored many key goals from long range throughout his career, including in three Cup finals. As he entered his mid 30s and his physical capability to get forward and join the attack declined, the number of long range strikes at goal decreased, with most of his goals coming from free kicks and penalty kicks.

In particular, his tactical intelligence and ability to read the game allowed him to break down the opposition&#x27;s attacking plays. In addition to his footballing attributes, Gerrard was highly regarded for his leadership, determination, and influence on the pitch throughout his career. Despite being vocal in his criticism of diving, Gerrard was accused of diving himself by certain pundits throughout his career.

Former Spanish striker and Liverpool teammate Fernando Torres hailed Gerrard as the best player he has ever played with. He stated that, &quot;He&#x27;s as creative as a Xavi at Barcelona, with something extra as well. When you add his energy, toughness, leadership and goalscoring ability and the result is a fantastic all-round player. He is without doubt the greatest player I have ever played with, he has everything.&quot;

In 2015, a decade after the iconic 2005 champions league final in Istanbul, former Italy defender and AC Milan great, Paolo Maldini, recalled memories of the final and heaped praise on Gerrard claiming that, &quot;I think Steven has been, and is, an absolutely complete player, because he had personality, technique, he could set the play and also defend, and he could score goals – penalty-kicks, free-kicks. So really a modern, complete player,&quot; said the former Italy defender.

He also stated that, &quot;I have a very clear memory of the final we lost in Istanbul, when he was helping his teammates with difficulties in defence. He started playing at the back and tackled every single player of Milan. It was a very special game during which we actually dominated Liverpool for 110 minutes out of 120. But I must say that what probably made the difference was his example for all his teammates, especially after reaching a draw, in being able to defend and resist, and at the end reach a result that was sincerely and absolutely unexpected after the first 45 minutes.&quot;

==Managerial career==
In November 2016, days before retiring as a player, Gerrard had an interview for the vacant managerial post at League One club Milton Keynes Dons, but said that he was not ready for the job.

===Liverpool Academy===
In January 2017, he was appointed youth coach at Liverpool, effective from February. On 11 April, it was reported that Gerrard would be taking charge of the Liverpool Under-18 side ahead of the 2017–18 season after impressing Jürgen Klopp and Alex Inglethorpe with his work ethic, knowledge and attitude towards academy coaching. However, before he took the next step on the path to receive his coaching credentials, Gerrard pulled on the Liverpool shirt one last time in a friendly against Australian club Sydney FC at the end of this Premier League campaign. On 7 September 2017, the club announced Gerrard would manage the Under-19 team in the 2017–18 UEFA Youth League.

===Rangers===
In late April 2018, Gerrard entered talks to become the new manager of Scottish Premiership club Rangers. On 1 May, incumbent manager Graeme Murty was dismissed, with the club confirming three days later that Gerrard would succeed him from 1 June, ahead of the 2018–19 season, signing a four-year contract. He made his senior managerial debut on 12 July, when he led Rangers to a 2–0 UEFA Europa League win over Macedonian team Shkupi. Gerrard&#x27;s first game in charge in the domestic league was a 1–1 draw against Aberdeen, away from home. Under Gerrard&#x27;s management, Rangers went twelve matches unbeaten in all competitions from the start of the season before finally suffering defeat on 2 September, losing 1–0 to rivals Celtic in the Old Firm derby. On 29 December, in the reverse fixture, Gerrard guided Rangers to their first win over Celtic since 2012, in a game that ended with a 1–0 scoreline.

Ahead of the 2019–20 season, Gerrard was linked with a return to the Premier League, after the managerial position at Newcastle United became vacant. The move would have seen him replace his former Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez, who left the club at the end of his contract. Gerrard reportedly turned down the opportunity to take over as the club&#x27;s manager, because he was comfortable at Rangers.

During the 2020–21 season, Gerrard led Rangers through a record-breaking season, claiming back-to-back derby wins over rivals Celtic, and topping their Europa League group. On 7 March 2021, Rangers won the Scottish Premiership title without losing a single league match, receiving 102 points and conceding only 13 goals across 38 matches. It was also Gerrard&#x27;s first trophy as a manager.

===Aston Villa===
On 11 November 2021, Gerrard was appointed as head coach at Premier League club Aston Villa on a three-and-a-half-year contract, succeeding Dean Smith, who was dismissed four days earlier. Villa paid Rangers compensation of around £4 million to release him from his contract. He led the club to a 2–0 home win against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the Premier League in his first game in charge. Results under Gerrard were generally mixed and the team finished the season in 14th place, three places lower than the previous campaign.

After winning just two of their opening 12 league games of the 2022–23 season, Gerrard was dismissed by Villa on 20 October 2022.

===Al-Ettifaq===
On 3 July 2023, Gerrard became the manager of Saudi Pro League club Al-Ettifaq. On 18 January 2024, it was reported that Gerrard had signed a two-year contract extension with the club, with his contract now ending in 2027. He left by mutual consent on 29 January 2025.

==Outside football==
===Personal life===
Gerrard&#x27;s cousin, Anthony Gerrard, became a professional centre-back. He came through at Everton, where he did not make the first team, and spent most of his career in the Football League. The two faced each other in a professional match for the first time in the 2012 Football League Cup final, when Steven&#x27;s Liverpool defeated Anthony&#x27;s Cardiff City in a penalty shoot-out in which both Gerrards missed.

One of Gerrard&#x27;s other cousins, Bobby Duncan, played for Liverpool&#x27;s Academy team.

Gerrard and his wife, Alex Curran, married on 16 June 2007, the same day as the weddings of his England teammates: Gary Neville, and Michael Carrick. The ceremony took place at Cliveden House Hotel in Taplow, Buckinghamshire. They have four children together.

Councillors of Knowsley voted to make Gerrard a Freeman of the Borough on 13 December 2006, and two weeks later, he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2007 New Year Honours for services to sport. He received an honorary fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University on 26 July 2008 as recognition for his contribution to sport.

In 2018, Amazon produced a documentary called &quot;Make Us Dream&quot; detailing the life of Gerrard from a young boy up until his post as Liverpool youth coach.

===Autobiography===
In September 2006, Gerrard published his first autobiography, &quot;Gerrard: My Autobiography&quot;, ghost-written by journalist Henry Winter, which went on to win the Sports Book of the Year honour at the British Book Awards. Gerrard&#x27;s second volume of autobiography, &quot;My Story&quot;, written with Donald McRae, was published in September 2015. The autobiography ends with &quot;I play for Jon-Paul&quot;. Gerrard&#x27;s cousin, Jon-Paul Gilhooley, was killed in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, when Gerrard was eight. Jon-Paul, who was 10 when he died, was the youngest of the 97 victims of the tragedy. &quot;It was difficult knowing one of your cousins had lost his life&quot;, Gerrard said. &quot;Seeing his family&#x27;s reaction drove me on to become the player I am today.

Gerrard released a second book in 2012, &quot;Steven Gerrard: My Liverpool Story&quot;.

In his third and latest autobiography, 2015&#x27;s &quot;My Story&quot;, he opined the four best players to have played alongside him are former Liverpool teammates Xabi Alonso, Fernando Torres and Luis Suárez and England teammate Wayne Rooney.

===Legal problems===
On 1 October 2007, Gerrard was involved in a low-speed collision in Southport when the car he was driving hit a ten-year-old cyclist, who had shot into the street and inadvertently crossed Gerrard&#x27;s path. He later visited the boy in the hospital and presented him with a pair of boots signed by Wayne Rooney, the boy&#x27;s favourite player, after which he stayed to sign autographs for other young patients.

On 29 December 2008, Gerrard was taken into custody outside the Lounge Inn in Southport on suspicion of a section 20 assault. He and two other men were later charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray, relating to an incident which left the bar&#x27;s disc jockey with a broken tooth and cuts to his forehead. The three were given police to court bail and were required to appear at North Sefton Magistrates&#x27; Court on 23 January 2009, where they all pleaded not guilty. The case was adjourned until 20 March when the assault charge was dropped but Gerrard was required to attend Liverpool Crown Court to face trial for affray. On 3 April, Gerrard again pleaded not guilty.
The case went to trial in Liverpool Crown Court. Gerrard&#x27;s co-defendants pleaded guilty before the trial but Gerrard maintained his innocence. Gerrard admitted hitting Marcus McGee but claimed it was in self-defence and on 24 July, Gerrard was found not guilty by the jury. Following the verdict, Gerrard said he was looking forward to getting back to playing football and putting the experience behind him.

===Entertainment===
In 2011, Gerrard appeared in the film &quot;Will&quot;, about an orphaned young Liverpool fan who hitchhikes to Istanbul for the 2005 UEFA Champions League final. In August 2014, Gerrard participated in the ALS Association&#x27;s Ice Bucket Challenge and went on to challenge Cardiff City winger, Craig Noone.

===Sponsorship===
Gerrard has had several different sponsorships in his career including current deals with Adidas, Jaguar Cars and Lucozade. In 2014, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed his combined income from salaries, bonuses and off-field earnings at $17.2 million for the previous 12 months. While Gerrard has worn several football boots during his career, he first wore a pair of Nike boots on his Liverpool debut, but soon signed a deal with Adidas in 1998 and has gone on to appear in many Adidas commercials with the likes of Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Lionel Messi and Kaká. Gerrard has worn ten versions of the Adidas Predator boot, with the Accelerator being the first, and throughout his career, he has been one of the brand&#x27;s major boot endorsees. In 2013, Gerrard switched boot silos to the Nitrocharge 1.0 first wearing the boots in the League Cup clash against rivals Manchester United on 25 September 2013.

<text>Bayswater is a residential and industrial suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Knox local government area. Bayswater recorded a population of 12,262 at the 2021 census.

==History==

The first Post Office in the area was Scoresby North, which opened on 8 May 1882 and renamed Macauley in 1884. When the railway arrived in 1889, a Bayswater office near the station replaced Macauley. In 1998 Bayswater Village (at the shopping centre of that name) office replaced Bayswater.

In the late 1940s, a number of German Templers (just released from the Tatura Internment Camp) settled in Bayswater and Boronia. Part of the Temple Society Australia, they built a Community Centre (1961) in Elizabeth Street and a Retirement Village, as well as Nursing Home Tabulam, in partnership with the Australian German Welfare Society (AGWS).

The Bayswater Wine Cellar is the oldest building in the region, erected in the mid 19th century to service loggers that travelled between the city and the Dandenongs. It was sold to a developer in late 2017.

===Bayswater CFA Fire Brigade===
On 17 November 1969, Bayswater Fire Brigade was registered with CFA. The Brigade became operational in January 1970 and attended its first fire call on 22 January. However, a site for the Fire Station had not yet been established so the Brigade vehicle was parked under a tarp at the rear of a service station on the corner of Mountain Highway and Highmoor Avenue, Bayswater. On Good Friday 1970 a tin shed was erected to house the Brigade vehicle and other operational equipment.

In 1973, the tin shed was relocated to a site adjacent to the Scoresby Road railway crossing until the present Fire Station was built in 1976.
In 2008, the Brigade leased an additional building on the same site to be used for administration, meetings and indoor training.

==Education==
Schools currently in Bayswater include Our Lady of Lourdes Primary School, Bayswater Primary School, Bayswater South Primary School, Bayswater West Primary School and Bayswater Secondary College (formerly Bayswater High School).

The Bayswater library is located inside the Mountain High Shopping Centre.

==Transport==
===Train===
Bayswater Station is located near the Mountain Highway, and is on the Belgrave line.

===Bus===
Bayswater is serviced by the following bus routes:
* 664 Chirnside Park - Knox City via Croydon &amp; Bayswater

==Sport and recreation==
Its most well-known reserve is Bayswater Park, where football and cricket is played on the two ovals, as well as netball and tennis, on surrounding courts. The adjacent playground, known by the locals as the &#x27;Train Park&#x27;, contains a disused steam engine, which has been altered for children to play on.

The suburb has an Australian Rules football team, Bayswater Football Netball Club, known as The Waters, who compete in the Eastern Football League.

The suburb is also the home of the Bayswater Cricket Club, of which they are a member of the Victorian Sub District Cricket Association.

Guy Turner Reserve hosts both the Bayswater Park Cricket Club; known as The Sharks who compete in the Ringwood District Cricket Association during summer and The Bayswater Strikers Soccer Club during winter.

The suburb also had the Bayswater Netball Club that competed in the Mountain District Netball Association located in Ferntree Gully, the club folded due to waning participation in the early 2010’s.

The Knox Little Athletics Centre also hosted the Bayswater Bullets Little Athletics Club which was established in 1968/69 unfortunately a similar fate befitted BBLAC as they disbanded around 2018/19.

<doc id="547400" wikidata="Q1344441" url="?curid=547400" title="Molecular mechanics">
<text>Molecular mechanics uses classical mechanics to model molecular systems. The Born–Oppenheimer approximation is assumed valid and the potential energy of all systems is calculated as a function of the nuclear coordinates using force fields. Molecular mechanics can be used to study molecule systems ranging in size and complexity from small to large biological systems or material assemblies with many thousands to millions of atoms.

All-atomistic molecular mechanics methods have the following properties: 
* Each atom is simulated as one particle
* Each particle is assigned a radius (typically the van der Waals radius), polarizability, and a constant net charge (generally derived from quantum calculations and/or experiment)
* Bonded interactions are treated as &quot;springs&quot; with an equilibrium distance equal to the experimental or calculated bond length

Variants on this theme are possible. For example, many simulations have historically used a &quot;united-atom&quot; representation in which each terminal methyl group or intermediate methylene unit was considered one particle, and large protein systems are commonly simulated using a &quot;bead&quot; model that assigns two to four particles per amino acid.

==Functional form==
The following functional abstraction, termed an interatomic potential function or force field in chemistry, calculates the molecular system&#x27;s potential energy (E) in a given conformation as a sum of individual energy terms.
:formula_1

where the components of the covalent and noncovalent contributions are given by the following summations:

:formula_2

:formula_3

The exact functional form of the potential function, or force field, depends on the particular simulation program being used. Generally the bond and angle terms are modeled as harmonic potentials centered around equilibrium bond-length values derived from experiment or theoretical calculations of electronic structure performed with software which does &quot;ab-initio&quot; type calculations such as Gaussian. For accurate reproduction of vibrational spectra, the Morse potential can be used instead, at computational cost. The dihedral or torsional terms typically have multiple minima and thus cannot be modeled as harmonic oscillators, though their specific functional form varies with the implementation. This class of terms may include &quot;improper&quot; dihedral terms, which function as correction factors for out-of-plane deviations (for example, they can be used to keep benzene rings planar, or correct geometry and chirality of tetrahedral atoms in a united-atom representation).

The non-bonded terms are much more computationally costly to calculate in full, since a typical atom is bonded to only a few of its neighbors, but interacts with every other atom in the molecule. Fortunately the van der Waals term falls off rapidly. It is typically modeled using a &quot;6–12 Lennard-Jones potential&quot;, which means that attractive forces fall off with distance as &quot;r&quot;−6 and repulsive forces as &quot;r&quot;−12, where r represents the distance between two atoms. The repulsive part &quot;r&quot;−12 is however unphysical, because repulsion increases exponentially. Description of van der Waals forces by the Lennard-Jones 6–12 potential introduces inaccuracies, which become significant at short distances. Generally a cutoff radius is used to speed up the calculation so that atom pairs which distances are greater than the cutoff have a van der Waals interaction energy of zero.

The electrostatic terms are notoriously difficult to calculate well because they do not fall off rapidly with distance, and long-range electrostatic interactions are often important features of the system under study (especially for proteins). The basic functional form is the Coulomb potential, which only falls off as &quot;r&quot;−1. A variety of methods are used to address this problem, the simplest being a cutoff radius similar to that used for the van der Waals terms. However, this introduces a sharp discontinuity between atoms inside and atoms outside the radius. Switching or scaling functions that modulate the apparent electrostatic energy are somewhat more accurate methods that multiply the calculated energy by a smoothly varying scaling factor from 0 to 1 at the outer and inner cutoff radii. Other more sophisticated but computationally intensive methods are particle mesh Ewald (PME) and the multipole algorithm.

In addition to the functional form of each energy term, a useful energy function must be assigned parameters for force constants, van der Waals multipliers, and other constant terms. These terms, together with the equilibrium bond, angle, and dihedral values, partial charge values, atomic masses and radii, and energy function definitions, are collectively termed a force field. Parameterization is typically done through agreement with experimental values and theoretical calculations results. Norman L. Allinger&#x27;s force field in the last MM4 version calculate for hydrocarbons heats of formation with a RMS error of 0.35 kcal/mol, vibrational spectra with a RMS error of 24 cm−1, rotational barriers with a RMS error of 2.2°, bond lengths within 0.004 Å and angles within 1°. Later MM4 versions cover also compounds with heteroatoms such as aliphatic amines.

Each force field is parameterized to be internally consistent, but the parameters are generally not transferable from one force field to another.

==Areas of application==

The main use of molecular mechanics is in the field of molecular dynamics. This uses the force field to calculate the forces acting on each particle and a suitable integrator to model the dynamics of the particles and predict trajectories. Given enough sampling and subject to the ergodic hypothesis, molecular dynamics trajectories can be used to estimate thermodynamic parameters of a system or probe kinetic properties, such as reaction rates and mechanisms.

Molecular mechanics is also used within QM/MM, which allows study of proteins and enzyme kinetics. The system is divided into two regions—one of which is treated with quantum mechanics (QM) allowing breaking and formation of bonds and the rest of the protein is modeled using molecular mechanics (MM). MM alone does not allow the study of mechanisms of enzymes, which QM allows. QM also produces more exact energy calculation of the system although it is much more computationally expensive.

Another application of molecular mechanics is energy minimization, whereby the force field is used as an optimization criterion. This method uses an appropriate algorithm (e.g. steepest descent) to find the molecular structure of a local energy minimum. These minima correspond to stable conformers of the molecule (in the chosen force field) and molecular motion can be modelled as vibrations around and interconversions between these stable conformers. It is thus common to find local energy minimization methods combined with global energy optimization, to find the global energy minimum (and other low energy states). At finite temperature, the molecule spends most of its time in these low-lying states, which thus dominate the molecular properties. Global optimization can be accomplished using simulated annealing, the Metropolis algorithm and other Monte Carlo methods, or using different deterministic methods of discrete or continuous optimization. While the force field represents only the enthalpic component of free energy (and only this component is included during energy minimization), it is possible to include the entropic component through the use of additional methods, such as normal mode analysis.

Molecular mechanics potential energy functions have been used to calculate binding constants, protein folding kinetics, protonation equilibria, active site coordinates, and to design binding sites.

==Environment and solvation==

In molecular mechanics, several ways exist to define the environment surrounding a molecule or molecules of interest. A system can be simulated in vacuum (termed a gas-phase simulation) with no surrounding environment, but this is usually undesirable because it introduces artifacts in the molecular geometry, especially in charged molecules. Surface charges that would ordinarily interact with solvent molecules instead interact with each other, producing molecular conformations that are unlikely to be present in any other environment. The most accurate way to solvate a system is to place explicit water molecules in the simulation box with the molecules of interest and treat the water molecules as interacting particles like those in the other molecule(s). A variety of water models exist with increasing levels of complexity, representing water as a simple hard sphere (a united-atom model), as three separate particles with fixed bond angle, or even as four or five separate interaction centers to account for unpaired electrons on the oxygen atom. As water models grow more complex, related simulations grow more computationally intensive. A compromise method has been found in implicit solvation, which replaces the explicitly represented water molecules with a mathematical expression that reproduces the average behavior of water molecules (or other solvents such as lipids). This method is useful to prevent artifacts that arise from vacuum simulations and reproduces bulk solvent properties well, but cannot reproduce situations in which individual water molecules create specific interactions with a solute that are not well captured by the solvent model, such as water molecules that are part of the hydrogen bond network within a protein.

<text>Bayswater North is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, east from Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Maroondah local government area. Bayswater North recorded a population of 9,014 at the 2021 census.

Bayswater North is part of a significant industrial and commercial precinct, which accommodates over 35,000 employees.

==Suburb features==

Bayswater North shares its postcode of 3153 with the adjacent suburb of Bayswater and the suburb is often referred to by residents without the &quot;North&quot; part of the name. Many local businesses also drop this reference in advertising their location (e.g. large retailer Bunnings Warehouse is located in Bayswater North but refers to its location as &quot;Bayswater&quot;). The official distinction between the two is that Bayswater North is the portion of the postcode area located in the City of Maroondah, whereas Bayswater is located in the City of Knox.

There is a small local shopping centre, Canterbury Gardens, which is anchored by a Woolworths supermarket. The majority of facilities for residents are located in Bayswater and nearby major shopping centres Westfield Knox and Eastland. A Bayswater North Post Office was open from 1962 until 1964.

===Public transport===
The nearest railway station is Bayswater railway station, on the Belgrave railway line. It is a Premium station and is located in Myki zone 2. Buses from several companies also service the area, linking residents directly with Bayswater station, surrounding suburbs and the retail and commercial precincts of Ringwood, Croydon and Westfield Knox.

For instance, copyleft licenses impose a duty on licensees to share their modifications to the work with the user or copy owner under some circumstances. No such duty would apply had the software in question been in the public domain.

==National and supranational laws==
===Canada===
In Canada, software is protected as a literary work under the Copyright Act of Canada. Copyright is acquired automatically when an original work is generated; the creator is not required to register or mark the work with the copyright symbol in order to be protected. The rights holder is granted: the exclusive right of reproduction, the right to rent the software, the right to restrain others from renting the software and the right to assign or license the copyright to others. Exceptions to these rights are set out by the terms of Fair Dealing; these exempt users from copyright liability covering usage and reproduction when performed for research, private study, education, parody or satire. Changes to the Copyright Act in regard to digital copyright were debated in the Canadian Parliament in 2008. Bill C-61 proposed alterations of the breadth and depth of exemptions for uses such as personal back-ups, reverse engineering and security testing.
===China===

===East Germany===
A 1979 East German court ruling found that software was &quot;neither a scientific work nor a creative achievement&quot; and ineligible for copyright protection, legalizing software copying in the country.

===European Union===
===India===
Software can be copyrighted in India. Copyright in software, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, vests in the author of the software, even for commissioned works. Copyright can be assigned or licensed through a written document, but under the Indian Copyright Act, in case the period of assignment is not specified, the period is deemed to be 5 years from the date of assignment (section 19(5) of the Copyright Act). In a recent judgement in the case of Pine Labs Private Limited v. Gemalto Terminals India Private Limited the Delhi High Court has laid down that the copyright belongs to the author (in this case, Pine Labs) and as the period of assignment was not specified in the document of assignment (the master service agreement), the copyright in the software reverted to Pine Labs after 5 years. See Assignment of Copyright in Software.

===Pakistan===
Under the provision of Copyright Ordinance 1962, works which fall into any of the following categories: literary, musical, or artistic are protected by Copyright law. The definition of literary work was amended by Copyright Amendment 1992 to include computer software. Section 2(p) of the ordinance defines a computer program as &quot;that is to say programmes recorded on any disc, tape, perforated media or other information storage devices, which, if fed into or located in a computer or computer based equipment is capable of reproducing any information&quot;. In event of infringement, civil and/or criminal proceedings can be carried out. According to Chapter XIV of Copyright Ordinance, a person can face a prison of up to 3 years and/or a penalty of up to one hundred thousand rupees if he is found guilty of renting computer software without permission of the owner. According to a study of Business Software Alliance, 84% of software in Pakistan is being used in violation of the Copyright law of Pakistan.

===United States===
Copyright protection attaches to “original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.” (17 U.S.C.A. § 102). Copyright functions by granting the author the right to exclude others. Copyright protects:

* literary works
* musical works (&amp; accompanying words)
* dramatic works (&amp; accompanying music)
* pantomimes and choreographed works
* pictorial, graphic, &amp; sculptural works
* motion pictures &amp; other audiovisual works
* sound recordings
* architectural works
+ compilations and derivative works 17 USC § 103(a).

In the United States, computer programs are literary works, under the definition in the Copyright Act, .

There is a certain amount of work that goes into making copyright successful and just as with other works, copyright for computer programs prohibits not only literal copying, but also copying of &quot;nonliteral elements&quot;, such as program&#x27;s structure, sequence and organization. These non-literal aspects, however, can be protected only &quot;to the extent that they incorporate authorship in programmer&#x27;s expression of original ideas, as distinguished from the ideas themselves.&quot; In &quot;Computer Associates vs Altai&quot;, the Second Circuit proposed the Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison test for identifying these protected elements. This test attempts to distinguish copyrightable aspects of a program from the purely utilitarian and the public domain.

Copyright attaches only to original works. A work is “created” when it is fixed in a “tangible medium of expression” for the first time. 17 U.S.C. § 101. Circuits differ on what it means for a work to be fixed for the purposes of copyright law and infringement analysis. The graphics, sounds, and appearance of a computer program also may be protected as an audiovisual work; as a result, a program can infringe even if no code was copied.
The set of operations available through the interface is not copyrightable in the United States under &quot;Lotus v. Borland&quot;, but it can be protected with a utility patent. The law is unclear as to whether transient copies such as those cached when transmitting digital content, or temporary copies in a computer&#x27;s RAM are “fixed” for the purposes of copyright law. The Ninth Circuit has held that “A derivative work must be fixed to be protected under the Act, but not to infringe.” In &quot;Apple v. Microsoft&quot;, the courts established that a look and feel copyright claim must demonstrate that specific elements of a user interface infringe on another work. A program&#x27;s particular combination of user interface elements is not copyrightable.

==== History ====
Historically, computer programs were not effectively protected by copyrights because computer programs were not viewed as a fixed, tangible object: object code was viewed as a utilitarian good produced from source code rather than as a creative work. Due to lack of precedent, this outcome was reached while deciding how to handle copyright of computer programs. The Copyright Office attempted to classify computer programs by drawing an analogy: the blueprints of a bridge and the resulting bridge compared to the source code of a program and the resulting executable object code. This analogy caused the Copyright Office to issue copyright certificates under its Rule of Doubt.

In 1974, the Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) was established. CONTU decided that &quot;computer programs, to the extent that they embody an author&#x27;s original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright.&quot; In 1980, the United States Congress added the definition of &quot;computer program&quot; to and amended to allow the owner of the program to make another copy or adaptation for use on a computer.

This legislation, plus court decisions such as &quot;Apple v. Franklin&quot; in 1983 clarified that the Copyright Act gave computer programs the copyright status of literary works. Many companies began to claim that they &quot;licensed&quot; but did not sell their products, in order to avoid the transfer of rights to the end-user via the doctrine of first sale (see &quot;Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology&quot;). These software license agreements are often labeled as end-user license agreements (EULAs). Another impact of the decision was the rise of the shrink-wrap closed source business model, where before a source code driven software distribution schema dominated.

In 1998, The United States Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) which criminalizes evasion of copy protection (with certain exceptions), destruction or mismanagement of copyright management information, but includes a clause to exempt ISPs from liability of infringement if one of their subscribers infringes. In addition, the DMCA extends protection to those who copy a program for maintenance, repair or backup as long as these copies are &quot;destroyed in the event that continued possession of the computer program should cease to be rightful.&quot;

====EULAs and rights of end users====
The Copyright Act expressly permits copies of a work to be made in some circumstances, even without the authorization of the copyright holder. In particular, &quot;owners of copies&quot; may make additional copies for archival purposes, &quot;as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program&quot;, or for maintenance purposes. Furthermore, &quot;owners of copies&quot; have the right to resell their copies, under the first sale doctrine and .

These rights only apply to &quot;owners of copies.&quot; Most software vendors claim that their products are &quot;licensed, not sold&quot;, thus sidestepping . American courts have taken varying approaches when confronted with these software license agreements. In &quot;MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Triad Systems Corp. v. Southeastern Express Co.&quot;, and &quot;Microsoft v Harmony&quot;, various Federal courts held that &quot;licensed, not sold&quot; language in an EULA was effective. Other courts have held that &quot;no bright-line rule distinguishes mere licenses from sales...The label placed on a transaction is not determinative&quot;. The Ninth Circuit took a similar view (in the specialized context of bankruptcy) in Microsoft Corp. v. DAK Industries, Inc.

By contrast, in the European Union the European Court of Justice held that a copyright holder cannot oppose the resale of a digitally sold software, in accordance with the rule of copyright exhaustion on first sale as ownership is transferred, and questions therefore the &quot;licensed, not sold&quot; EULAs in the EU.

====Fair use====
Fair use is a defense to an allegation of copyright infringement under section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976. This section describes some of the uses of copyrighted software that courts have held to be fair.

In &quot;Galoob v. Nintendo&quot;, the 9th Circuit held that modification of copyrighted software for personal use was fair. In &quot;Sega v. Accolade&quot;, the 9th Circuit held that making copies in the course of reverse engineering is a fair use, when it is the only way to get access to the &quot;ideas and functional elements&quot; in the copyrighted code, and when &quot;there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access&quot;.

The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.&quot; (2021) that the reuse of application programming interfaces (APIs) including representative source code can be transformative and fall within fair use, though did not rule if such APIs are copyrightable.

====Copyleft====

A copyleft is a type of copyright license that allows redistributing the work (with or without changes) on condition that recipients are also granted these rights.

<text>Club de Fútbol Monterrey Rayados, A.C., simply known as Monterrey or by its nickname Rayados, is a Mexican professional football club based in the Monterrey metropolitan area, Nuevo León, that plays in Liga MX, the top division of Mexican football. Founded in 1945, it is the oldest active professional club from the northern part of Mexico. Since 1999 the club has been owned by FEMSA, Latin America&#x27;s largest bottling company. Its home games have been played in Estadio BBVA since 2015. The team&#x27;s nickname of &quot;Rayados&quot; (The Striped-Ones) stems from the club&#x27;s traditional navy blue striped uniform. The uniform is reflected in the club&#x27;s current crest, which is also decorated with stars above the crest representing the club&#x27;s league titles and stars below representing continental.

Monterrey has won five league titles, three domestic cups, and five CONCACAF Champions League titles (notably, three consecutive tournaments in 2011, 2012 and 2013). In 2020, Monterrey became the second Mexican club to complete the continental treble.

The club&#x27;s oldest rival is Tigres UANL of the Autonomous University of Nuevo León. The derby between the two, known as the &quot;Clásico Regiomontano&quot;, is considered to be one of the most heated and intensely competed rivalries in Mexican football; both teams consistently rank among the highest in attendance and regularly feature among the most expensively assembled squads in the country.

==History==

===1940s–50s===

Club de Football Monterrey was founded on 28 June 1945, near the end of World War II by a group of industrial businessmen headed by Ramón Cárdenas Coronado, Enrique Ayala Medina, Paul C. Probert, Rogelio Cantú Gómez and Miguel Margáín Zozaya.

The team&#x27;s nickname was popularly accepted, after the team&#x27;s uniform, which is traditionally white with navy blue vertical stripes. Although the original uniform was white with a diagonal blue upper shoulder, the stripes were inspired in 1965, when the &quot;Tampico Madero&quot; (nicknamed &quot;Jaibas Bravas&quot;, or Brave crabs) football team wore them, and the Monterrey team adopted them. Since then, the home uniform consists of vertical blue and white striped jerseys with blue shorts.

In its first professional game, played on 19 August 1945 against San Sebastián de León, Monterrey won 1–0, with José &quot;Che&quot; Gómez scoring the winner. That joy quickly came to an end, first by losing 6–0 to Montezuma, and then having the club&#x27;s travelling bus involved in a tragic accident in the San Juan de los Lagos roads that would take the lives of many of the club&#x27;s players and had a big impact on the surviving players. The other Mexican clubs in solidarity loaned players to Monterrey in order to continue playing the tournament, but the club struggled nevertheless; they lost 21 games in a row and conceded 121 goals that year, finishing last in the league. Due to these events, the club decided to stop playing in the league in 1946 in honor of the players who died.

It was not until 1952 when the club resumed action thanks to Dr. Carlos Canseco, president of the Asociación de Fútbol de Nuevo León. The club enrolled in the second division and just 4 years later the club earned promotion to the top division. Once again the joy was short-lived, when the club finished last in their first year back and was relegated once again to the second division after finishing with a record of 4 wins, 7 draws and 13 losses for a total of 15 points, just 1 short of Zacatepec who earned their permanence in the category. The club would once again earn the promotion in the 1959–60 season, and haven&#x27;t been relegated since then. 

===1960s===
The club started off the 1960s in bad shape, barely avoiding relegation with only 2 more points than Club Celaya, who had 19 points, in the 1960–61 season.

In the 1961–62 season the club was again close to relegation, finishing second to last for the second year in a row just one point ahead of Zacatepec, who had 18 points and was relegated. In the following season the club finally managed to have a decent campaign in the first division, finishing 5th in the league. 

In the 1963–64 season the club improved their performance and would finish 3rd in the league just 5 points behind champions Guadalajara who had 37 points. In the following two seasons the club would finish third and fourth respectively, narrowly missing out on clinching titles by only a few points. The 1966–67 season was mediocre, as the club finished tied for 8th in the league with Irapuato on 30 points each. This season is also remembered for Jabatos de Nuevo Leon&#x27;s promotion to the first division, which meant 2 clubs from Monterrey would be participating in the first division for the first time. However, the following season was even worse, with the club finishing 14th, only four points from relegation. 

===1970s===
In 1970 the tournament was split into 2 short tournaments, due to the 1970 World Cup that was taking part in Mexico. In the first stage, the club was placed in group 1 where they managed to finish 2nd with 17 points, one less than group leader Toluca. In the second stage the club finished 7th of eight teams. The following year Monterrey finished runner up to Club América who went on to win the league title that year against Toluca.

In the 1971–72 tournament the club qualified for the play-offs which had been introduced a few years back. The club would lose in quarterfinals to Club América 2–1 on aggregate. The following year the club missed out on the playoffs, finishing tied for 5th with Veracruz and Guadalajara each with 32 points. The following season the club managed to qualify for the quarterfinals where they once again were eliminated, this time by Atlético Español 5–6 on aggregate.

Monterrey played its first match in international tournaments on 5 July 1975 in the 1975 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup when they defeated Canadian club Serbian White Eagles FC by a score of 2–0.

In the 1975–76 tournament the club finished in first place with a total of 44 points by means of 16 wins, 12 draws and 10 losses. In quarterfinals the club played Cruz Azul and won 7–2 on aggregate. In the semifinals the club played against Guadalajara who eliminated them, 2–3 on aggregate. During 1975, the Portuguese superstar Eusébio played for the club.

In the 1976–77 and 1977–78 seasons, the club failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing 4th both times. In the 1978–79 tournament the club once again qualified to the playoffs finishing 1st in group one with a total of 40 points by means of 14 wins 12 draws and 12 losses. This time a short tournament was played by the best 8 teams in the league who were then split into 2 groups. Monterrey was placed in group 2 along with Pumas, Tigres and Zacatepec. After 6 rounds of play the club finished in 3rd place with 6 points, just 2 points behind Pumas who went on to lose against Cruz Azul, the winners of the other group. 

In the following season the club finished 3rd in group 1 with 34 points but failed to qualify for the playoffs again. The decade came to an end with &quot;Rayados&quot; having shown great effort, as they qualified a couple times for the playoffs, but failed to win their first league title.

===1980s===
In the year 1989, the anthem of Rayados was created by composer Luis Aguilé. It is considered by Monterrey&#x27;s fans as one of the symbols of identity of the team.

===1990s===
At the beginning of the decade, Monterrey signed two notable players, Carlos Hermosillo and Manuel Negrete, for the 1990–91 season. The next season, they won their first Copa MX after defeating Juarez 4–2 in the Estadio Tecnológico and then went on to reach the league final of the 1992–93 season, losing to Atlante.

While the early years of the decade seemed promising for Monterrey, the latter half of the decade would prove to be a disappointing one, as financial problems started to become a problem for the club. During this period, the club sold many players who would go on to have successful careers with other teams like Ramón Morales and Sinha. Young talent Jesus Arellano was sold to Guadalajara in 1997, though he returned to the club in 2000 and spent the next eleven years as captain before retiring in 2011.

One of the most memorable moments of this decade was the so-called &quot;Clasico del Descenso&quot; in the 1995–96 season. On 24 March 1996, Monterrey defeated their arch-rivals Tigres 2–1 at Estadio Universitario. Tigres were facing a relegation battle after years of poor results, and needed a victory to avoid being relegated; the defeat meant that Tigres would be relegated for the first and so far only time in their history to the Segunda División.

In 1999, Monterrey was facing a fierce relegation battle of its own against Puebla, culminating on May 9, 1999, when the teams faced each other at the Estadio Tecnológico to decide which team would get relegated. Monterrey only needed a draw to stay in the Primera División, and with a memorable performance from Francisco Javier &quot;El Abuelo&quot; Cruz who had played a vital role in Monterrey&#x27;s first title win thirteen years before, Monterrey managed to draw 1–1 and stay in Mexico&#x27;s top flight.

===21st century===

In 2002, Monterrey hired Argentinian coach Daniel Passarella and started to form a strong and competitive side featuring the likes of Guillermo Franco, Walter Erviti, Jesus Arellano and Luis Perez. In the Clausura 2003 tournament, they won their first official title. In the semi-finals, they faced their arch-rivals Tigres for the first time ever in a Liguilla. In the first leg, they won 4–1 at the Estadio Universitario, and despite losing 2–1 at their home ground in the second leg, they managed to advance to the finals with an aggregate victory of 5–3. On June 14, 2003, they defeated Monarcas Morelia 3–1 on aggregate to claim their second league title after 17 years.

Pasarella left in 2004, and afterwards, Monterrey hired Miguel Herrera to be their head coach. He led them to the finals of the Apertura 2004, but the club lost against Pumas. He would lead them to the finals again in the Apertura 2005 tournament, this time losing to Toluca by an aggregate of 6–3. After the loss, Guillermo Franco left the club to play for Spanish club Villarreal. Herrera would remain their head coach until 2007, when he was fired after a poor string of results in the Apertura 2007. For the Clausura 2008, Monterrey hired Ricardo La Volpe to be their head coach, and they managed to reach the semi-finals. This team featured new players such as Humberto Suazo and newly acquired league veteran striker Jared Borgetti. However, the next tournament was a poor one for Rayados, as they finished in 14th place.

====The Vucetich Era (2009–13)====

In 2009, Monterrey hired coach Víctor Manuel Vucetich and formed a team that would become one of the strongest in the league, with an attack led by Humberto Suazo and new acquisition Aldo de Nigris, a midfield featuring veteran players Luis Ernesto Perez and Jesus Arellano along with Walter Ayovi and a defence led by Jose Maria Basanta, Duilio Davino and goalkeeper Jonathan Orozco. They won their third league title, the Apertura 2009 tournament, with an aggregate 6–4 victory against Cruz Azul in the finals. The first leg was played at the Estadio Tecnológico, where Monterrey overcame a 3–1 deficit to win the game 4–3. The second leg was played at the Estadio Azul, with Monterrey winning 2–1. Thus, after a six-year wait Monterrey lifted their third league title.
In the next tournament, Humberto Suazo left to play for Spanish club Real Zaragoza, but nonetheless, Monterrey managed to finish on top of the table for the first time in their history. However, they would be eliminated in the quarter-finals by Pachuca. Suazo returned to Rayados for the Apertura 2010 tournament, and they managed to win their fourth league title when they defeated Santos Laguna in the finals. Although they lost 3–2 in the first leg, they were able to make a comeback and win 3–0 in the second leg at the Estadio Tecnológico, with Humberto Suazo and Jose Basanta scoring two and one goals, respectively. With an aggregate score of 5–3, Monterrey claimed their fourth title.

Monterrey secured a place in the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League and won the tournament for the first time in their history. They faced Real Salt Lake in the Finals and won 3–2 on aggregate to claim their first CONCACAF Champions League title and the third title in the Vucetich Era.

The following year, they reached the finals of the Clausura 2012 league tournament and the 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League. Both finals were against the same opponent, Santos Laguna. Rayados were seeking to win their fifth league title and their second Champions League title. They lost the Clausura 2012 finals against Santos, but won the finals of the Champions League against them to claim their second consecutive CONCACAF title.

Monterrey reached the finals of the 2012–13 CONCACAF Champions League for the third consecutive time, and faced Santos Laguna in a repeat of the previous year&#x27;s final. The first leg finished in a 0–0 draw. In the second leg, Santos built a 2–0 lead with goals from Darwin Quintero and former Rayados player Felipe Baloy. However, Monterrey managed to make a dramatic comeback and scored four goals within 30 minutes, starting with a brace from Aldo de Nigris and a goal each from Humberto Suazo and Neri Cardozo, which gave Monterrey their third consecutive CONCACAF Champions League title and the fifth overall title in the Vucetich Era. This solidified them as the best Mexican soccer team of all time. Although they enjoyed tremendous success in the CONCACAF Champions League, they did not return to the following tournament as they could not reach any league finals during the 2012–13 Liga MX season and thus could not get a chance to try to become the first team to win the tournament four times in a row.

Monterrey started the 2013–14 season with a lot of changes. Aldo de Nigris left the club to join Chivas, and Walter Ayovi joined Pachuca. By now, players like Jesus Arellano and Duilio Davino had retired, and long-time club players like Luis Ernesto Perez had left the club. With the arrival of new players like Dorlan Pabon and Leobardo Lopez, Monterrey was ready for the Apertura 2013 tournament. However, a string of poor results and the shock early departure of Pabon would prove to be a threat as Monterrey started the tournament poorly. On August 25, 2013, Rayados announced that Vucetich had stepped down as coach, and thus the Vucetich Era, which earned the club a total of five titles in four years, came to an end.
====Post-Vucetich period (2013–15)====

Rayados hired José Guadalupe Cruz to become the new manager of the team, and although they managed to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup, the Copa MX, they failed to qualify to the playoffs of the Apertura 2013 tournament. After a bad start to the Clausura 2014, they fired Cruz on February 18, 2014, after only 17 league games coached.
Monterrey replaced Cruz with Carlos Barra, who had worked as an assistant coach for Vucetich. Although they failed to reach the playoffs for the second consecutive tournament, the team kept Barra for the 2014–15 season. Colombian striker Dorlan Pabon re-joined the team, and with new signings such as Stefan Medina and Pablo Barrera, Monterrey started the Apertura 2014 tournament with high expectations. They managed to secure 6th place and returned to the playoffs for the first time since Vucetich had managed the club. The club had a strike partnership of Dorlan Pabon and Humberto Suazo, with Pabon scoring 11 goals. The club reached the semi-finals but lost 3–0 on aggregate against the eventual champions Club América in what would prove to be Suazo&#x27;s last games with the club before returning to Colo-Colo. Suazo had scored over 102 league goals in a seven-year span and became the all-time top scorer for the club at the time.
The team started the Clausura 2015 tournament in poor form, losing four of their first six games, and on February 15, the team fired Barra and replaced him with two-time Liga MX champion Antonio Mohamed, who had led Club América to the league championship the previous tournament. Mohamed had played for Rayados during his years as a player. He was part of the squad that managed to avoid relegation in 1999. Monterrey did not qualify to the playoffs under Mohamed, but the club were keen on keeping him for the 2015–16 season. That season would prove to be a special one as the team were moving to a new home ground, the Estadio BBVA Bancomer. In the summer, Rayados made new signings, including midfielder Walter Gargano, striker Rogelio Funes Mori and re-signed Jose Maria Basanta, who had left for Italian side Florentina after the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Former club veterans Aldo de Nigris and Luis Ernesto Pérez also returned to the club, along with the promotion to the first team of promising young center back Cesar Montes. Rayados had a formidable attacking trio of Dorlan Pabon, Rogelio Funes Mori and Edwin Cardona, who had signed with Monterrey during the winter of 2015. They narrowly missed the playoffs of the Apertura 2015 tournament, but their offense was lauded by many as one of the best in the league.

====Tenure of Antonio Mohamed (2015–2018)====
After failing to qualify for the playoffs in 2015, the club loaned several players to other clubs in the league. Players such as Stefan Medina and Severo Meza were loaned to Pachuca and Sinaloa, respectively. In the winter of 2016, the team acquired club veteran Walter Ayovi who had left the club in 2013 and River Plate midfielder Carlos Sánchez who had won the Copa Libertadores a few months prior. The team began the Clausura 2016 tournament in great form by winning their first three games. They went on to have their best regular season in years by finishing on top of the league with 37 points, seven points ahead of second place Pachuca. The team&#x27;s success was primarily due to their attacking trio composed of Pabon, Funes Mori and Cardona, with midfielder Carlos Sanchez providing several goals and assists.

The team entered the playoffs as favourites to win the title. In the quarterfinals, they faced their arch-rivals and defending league champions Tigres UANL, the first leg was played at the Estadio Universitario where Monterrey won 3–1. The away leg was played at the BBVA Bancomer, where Tigres won 2–1 despite several penalties that were controversially awarded to Monterrey. Monterrey advanced to the semi-finals with a 4–3 aggregate victory and extended their record of never being eliminated by Tigres in the playoffs. In the semi-finals, they faced América, losing the first leg at the Estadio Azteca 1–0. In the second leg, they faced them at home and pulled off a dramatic 4–2 victory, in what was described by some pundits as one of the best games in the history of the playoffs. They advanced to the league finals where they would face Pachuca. Controversy arose when it was confirmed that Carlos Sanchez would not be able to play the finals as the Uruguay national team had called him up for the upcoming Copa América Centenario. In the league finals against Pachuca, Monterrey lost the first leg 1–0 at the Estadio Hidalgo, with the sole goal coming from striker Franco Jara. The second leg took place at the Estadio BBVA Bancomer in what was its first ever final since it was inaugurated the year before. On May 29, in front of 53,000 spectators, the final was played. Monterrey opened the scoring in the 39th minute with a shot from Dorlan Pabon to level the aggregate 1–1. Veteran goalkeeper Óscar Pérez had several key saves for Pachuca, and in the closing minutes of the game, a header from Victor Guzman in the 93rd minute gave the title to Pachuca in what was described by the Mexican media as a heart-breaking defeat for Monterrey.

The following tournament ended in disappointment as the team narrowly failed to qualify to the playoffs of the Apertura 2016. However, it also saw the return of Rayados to the CONCACAF Champions League after a three-year absence, having won the tournament three times in a row under Vucetich. The team had high hopes to redeem itself after their league title loss; however, the team was shockingly eliminated in the group stage after finishing second in their group behind Panamanian club Arabe Unido.

In the Apertura 2017 season, Monterrey finished the regular season in first place with 37 points and advanced to playoffs. In quarterfinals, Monterrey beat Atlas 2–1 in the first leg and 4–1 in the second, a 6–2 aggregate. Monterrey faced Morelia in semifinals, winning 1–0 in the away leg and 4–0 in the home leg, a 5–0 aggregate. Monterrey advanced to the final against arch rival Tigres, In the first leg, the teams tied 1–1 at the Estadio Universitario. In the second leg at the Estadio BBVA Bancomer, Tigres beat Monterrey 2–1 with goals from Eduardo Vargas and Francisco Meza. In May 2018, Mohamed resigned from his position shortly after being eliminated from the Clausura 2018 playoffs by Club Tijuana. He left the club having won two titles and breaking the club record amount of points for short seasons, but was criticized for various playoff failures.

==== Appointment of Diego Alonso (2018–2019) ====

After announcing the appointment of Diego Alonso in July 2018, the club would have a great run in the Copa MX. Despite beating Querétaro 1–0 in the quarter-finals and Pachuca on penalties in the semi-finals, the club would fall short, losing 2–0 to Cruz Azul in Copa MX Apertura final. Monterrey would finish third in the Liga MX Clausura and fifth in the Liga MX Apertura, giving them a playoff spot in both competitions. They would advance to the semifinals in the Clausura playoffs, beating Necaxa but losing to Tigres on a league position decider after a 1–1 draw. In the Apertura playoffs they would have to face the same faith, going on to the semi-finals of the competition, beating Santos Laguna 3–0 on aggregate in the quarter-finals until facing Cruz Azul and falling short on a league position decider after a 1–1 draw. In the CONCACAF Champions League, they would go on to win the continental tournament after convincingly beating Sporting Kansas City 10–2 on aggregate in the semi-final and finally beating rivals Tigres in the CONCACAF Champions League final. This championship was significant to the city, and seen as a kind of revenge for the domestic final lost to Tigres, and is known in the city as &quot;the star that shines the most&quot;.

In the Apertura 2019 season, Diego Alonso would be dismissed from his post having more defeats than victories in the Apertura.

==== Reappointment of Antonio Mohamed (2019–2020) ====
On 14 October, Antonio Mohamed was reappointed as the manager of Monterrey. The club would find themselves in a good run in the Club World Cup, advancing to the semi-finals after beating Al Sadd 3–2, but were eventually eliminated by losing to Liverpool after a stoppage time winner from Roberto Firmino. The club would beat Al Hilal on penalties, earning a third place medal in the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup. That same month, despite the club finishing 8th on the Apertura general table, they would go on to reach the championship finals against América and defeat them in penalties, winning 4–2 and securing their 5th championship league trophy.

==Culture==

===Colours===

Since the club&#x27;s founding in 1945, the colours used by the club have been white and blue, with varied use from the usual stripes. The shade of the blue itself has been in constant change, ranging from navy and cobalt to slightly lighter tones. The third colour has also been inconsistent, sometimes presented as being red, orange and cyan, and recently, violet, purple or green.

=== Youth development ===
The club has constantly emphasized home-grown (&quot;cantera&quot;) players and has produced international players such as Francisco Javier Cruz, Héctor Becerra, Missael Espinoza, Jesús Arellano, Antonio de Nigris, Severo Meza, Jonathan Orozco, Jesús Zavala, Hiram Mier, Jesús Manuel Corona, César Montes, Jonathan González, and Carlos Rodríguez among others.

===Rivalry===

Rayados&#x27; biggest rival is Tigres UANL. This rivalry is called the Clásico Regiomontano. Monterrey and Tigres are both known to sell out all of their home games regardless of weather conditions and the teams&#x27; status. For Clásico matches, the stadium is sold out as soon as tickets go on sale. The rivalry has been labeled as the most intensely competed rivalry in Mexican football.

As of August 2022, there have been a total of 128 official Clásico games, Tigres has been victorious in 47 of them, while Monterrey has won 42, and a total of 39 games have been draws. Monterrey and Tigres played their first Clásico on 13 July 1974 in the Estadio Universitario, with the match ending in a 1–1 draw. Monterrey would be the first team to win the Clásico in their second confrontation, 2–1. Almost all their first encounters were played in the Estadio Universitario, with averages of 70,000 fans attending these games, which were before the stadium renovation. In addition, there were also another six &quot;non-official&quot; games before the first official Clásico, in five of which Rayados were victorious. 

Monterrey has recently held somewhat of a regional rivalry with state neighbors Santos Laguna, whom they have played a total of four finals, with Monterrey winning three of them and Santos one. It is known by many as La Nortena.

===Fan base===
Los Rayados supporters constantly fill the Estadio BBVA Bancomer. They had the highest average Liga MX attendance (50,000 per game) in 2016. The city of Monterrey claims and does have Mexico&#x27;s most loyal supporting crowds for their teams, due to the city having the only venues that regularly sell-out in the Primera División. There is a rivalry between the &quot;La Adicción&quot;, a C.F. Monterrey support crowd, and the &quot;Libres y Lokos&quot;, a Tigres UANL support crowd, each time a &quot;Clásico&quot; takes place. 

===Rayados Kids===

In 2017 Rayados C.f. launched its YouTube and YouTube Kids original series, Rayados Kids, dedicated to creating content for children who love the team, in interview style format with the team players and original stories revolving around the teams actual positioning on soccer leagues. The web garnered around six thousand subscriptions and one million views in its first year.

===Rayados Christmas Campaign===

Since 2010 Rayados teammates have joined to wish a merry Christmas to its fans, by filming their annual holiday campaign. It has become a tradition to include a new rendition of their famous crowd chant song &quot;corrido de monterrey&quot; each year on their holiday video, showing their fans how their passion lives &quot;en la vida y en la cancha&quot; ( in life and on the field).

==Grounds==
Monterrey played their home matches at the Estadio Tecnológico from 1950 to 2015, though for a period of time from 1973 to 1980 they played at the Estadio Universitario, the stadium was opened on July 17, 1950, by Mexican president Miguel Alemán Valdés, it was the second oldest football stadium in Mexico, after Estadio Azul. The stadium was a part of the 1986 Mexico FIFA World Cup which could hold 38,000 people, and served 4 matches within the tournament but, in July 2017 the stadium began to be demolished.

In 1977–78, with preparations for the 1977 CONCACAF Championship underway at the Estadio Universitario, both Tigres and Rayados played at the Estadio Tecnológico, including the first &quot;Clásico Regio&quot; derby held in the stadium; it would be the first of 42 meetings between the two clubs venue, with the final fixture being a 2–2 draw in October 2014.
Monterrey won league titles in 1986 (Mexico 1986) and Apertura 2010 in the venue, as well as the Copa MX in 1991 and the CONCACAF Champions League in 2012–13.In July 2015, Monterrey moved to a new stadium called Estadio BBVA, located in Guadalupe, Nuevo León, in Greater Monterrey. The new stadium currently has a capacity of 53,500 people. The stadium has similar features of those incorporated within the design of England&#x27;s Wembley Stadium and the Aviva Stadium in Ireland. The stadium was inaugurated on 2 August 2015 in a friendly match for the eighth edition of the Eusébio Cup, where Monterrey defeated Benfica 3–0 hosting in front of a sold-out crowd.

Estadio BBVA, designed by Christopher Lee of Populous, started its development in October 2011, and included plans for reforestation and environmental healing for the decaying area that surrounds the construction site. The stadium was developed by FEMSA which costed around US$200 million. It is seen as one of the most beautiful stadiums in Mexico, it has the fourth largest capacity crowd in Mexico. It has an authentic grass surface, suites, a club-themed Restaurant, a club lounge, and high-end interior and exterior design. The inclination of the grandstand is 34 degrees and with the minimum distance allowed by FIFA to provide unsurpassed closeness to the action.

On 29 May 2016, Monterrey played their first final in their new stadium in front of 50,000 fans against Pachuca for the Clausura 2016 championship, which they tied 1–1, but lost 2–1 on aggregate.

==Kits and sponsorship==

===Kit evolution===

The original uniform was a shirt that was split diagonally across the chest with blue and white at each side, with white shorts and navy blue socks. In 1955 after winning the second division the club used a white shirt with two horizontal blue lines across the chest. In the 1960s the club wore a different kit inspired by the one used by Jaibos Tampico Madero with vertical baby blue lines with white shorts and socks. It was in 1962 when D. José Ramón Ballina introduced the kit that the club still uses to date, inspired by Asturias FC, a club he had played in Mexico City.

In the 1970s, many models emerged, some with broad, thicker stripes, and blue and black combinations, but the most significant change occurred in the mid-1980s when the color of the T-shirt changed from royal blue to navy blue, a colour that is still in use today.

Atletica was the kit manufacturer from 1999 to 2007, followed by American company Nike which manufactured the kits from 2007 to 2014. Afterwards, Monterrey signed a contract with German sportswear manufacturer Puma which has been making the team&#x27;s kit ever since.

<text>David Howard Harrison (June 1, 1843 – September 8, 1905) was a politician, farmer and physician. He was born in the township of London, Canada West, and moved to Manitoba in 1882. He and his family soon established themselves as substantial landowners.

Harrison&#x27;s political fortunes went through a remarkable rise and fall between 1882 and 1888. He forged an alliance with Premier John Norquay soon after moving to Manitoba, and in the election of 1883 was elected for the riding of Minnedosa as a Liberal-Conservative, easily defeating his Liberal opponent David Glass. On August 27, 1886, Harrison was appointed Minister of Agriculture, Statistics and Health, and was touted as a possible successor to Norquay. He was re-elected for the new riding of Minnedosa West later in the year, this time defeating Liberal J.W. Shanks.

Norquay was forced to resign in early December 1887, after a financial crisis involving railway transfers cost him the support of his ministers. Harrison became Premier on December 26, 1887, and attempted to form an administration from the remnants of Norquay&#x27;s alliance.

Harrison&#x27;s ministry never got off the ground. He was unable to win the support of a clear majority of MLAs, and lost a vital by-election on January 12, 1888. He resigned one week later, at which time the Lt. Governor called on Liberal Thomas Greenway to form a new administration.

Harrison was technically a &quot;non-partisan&quot; Premier, but his ministry was closely aligned with the national Conservative Party of John A. Macdonald and was dominated by local Conservatives. An official Conservative Party was formed in the province soon after his resignation.

After resigning as Premier, Harrison seems to have abandoned active political life. He allowed Norquay to retake the leadership of the &quot;Conservative Party&quot;, and did not seek re-election in 1888. Achieving success in Neepawa as a banker, he moved to British Columbia in 1900. He died of a lingering illness five years later.

<text>Ferntree Gully is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, at the foothills of the Dandenong Ranges, 30 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Knox local government area. Ferntree Gully recorded a population of 27,398 at the 2021 census.

Ferntree Gully, The Basin, Boronia and Upper Ferntree Gully are the only Dandenong Ranges towns or suburbs in the City of Knox (although some parts of Upper Ferntree Gully are within the Shire of Yarra Ranges). The City of Knox is one of the few cities not broken-up during the Kennett government review of councils and had its area expanded to include parts of Upper Ferntree Gully that were previously in the Shire of Sherbrooke (now part of the Yarra Ranges Shire).

Ferntree Gully and Belgrave are closely linked in many ways. Ferntree Gully is younger than Belgrave (Belgrave being established in 1851 and Ferntree Gully in 1880).

Ferntree Gully has many Eucalyptus trees (gum trees) and lies at the foothills of the Dandenong Ranges. Its boundaries meet Upper Ferntree Gully, a separate but similarly named suburb with the same postcode, Boronia to the North, Scoresby to the West and Lysterfield to the South. The eastern boundary coincides with the Ferntree Gully National Park which is a National Park administered by the Federal Government. Ferntree Gully is in a high fire risk area in the vicinity of the Ferntree Gully National Park, however the majority of the suburb is considered low risk.

==Environment==

Natural features include a large part of the Dandenong Ranges National Park which forms a picturesque backdrop to Ferntree Gully, especially the Ferntree Gully village part of the suburb. Important features of that national park include One Tree Hill (formerly a fire-lookout, but now covered with trees, the lookout has been removed), and the Kokoda Trail, a memorial walk dedicated to the Kokoda Trail of WW2 (includes interpretive signage)—this part of the National Park (which is well known as &quot;1000 steps&quot;, where many tourists go) is located in the neighbouring suburb of Upper Ferntree Gully—and accessed via the Mt Dandenong Tourist Road. It is also a place for picnics and exercise, where many community groups meet.

==History==

Ferntree Gully, was home to the Wurundjeri Aboriginal tribe prior to European settlement. The abundance of Tree Ferns stretched from the Township to the National Park and picturesque scenery and lush flora started attracting recreational visitors from the 1870s. In 1882, the gully was set aside for public use. Throughout the 1880s the township began to grow, shops were established, as well as hotels, churches, and a primary school. With the arrival of the railway line (extended from Ringwood) in 1889, the area became more accessible to visitors. Initially the line terminated at Upper Ferntree Gully, with a narrow-gauge line extending to Gembrook in 1900. Between 1958 and 1962, the narrow-gauge 2&#x27; 6&quot; line was upgraded to broad-gauge 5&#x27; 3&quot; and electrified to Belgrave which is where the narrow-gauge line (now better known as Puffing Billy) operates from today. Up until the mid-1970s the old Puffing Billy Railway shed was located below Quarry Road just west of Upper Ferntree Gully railway station.

The Shire of Fern Tree Gully also was proclaimed in 1889. One of the Buildings from the old shire offices, on the corner of Selman Avenue and Burwood Highway, Ferntree Gully, has been preserved under a heritage listing and now houses a community health service (entry via Selman Avenue). It was also used as the local library for many years. On 4 July 1969, the Shire of Knox was proclaimed a &quot;City&quot; and new offices were built on Burwood Highway Wantirna South where the offices are today. The Ferntree Gully cemetery is the resting place of a number of historically significant local people as well as world-renowned artists, authors and poets.

Ambleside Homestead, in Olivebank Road, Ferntree Gully, was built in the 1890s and is now the base for the Knox Historical Society and a local history museum. It holds extensive collections of historic documents and photographs dating back to the 1800s and is also the custodian of all old school photographs from the City and Shires of Knox schools maintaining an accurate collection up to today. Old school photos from FTG and Boronia High, Knox Tech and primary schools are on display and available for copy for a fee. Period furnishings and artefacts and vintage farm equipment reflect the pioneer life and development of the area.
W. Kennedy-Ross, a Scot, secured the title to the triangular section bounded by Ferntree Gully Road, Scoresby Road and Burwood Highway, in 1872. About 1886, Ross erected the Hunting Tower Hotel, which was replaced a few years later by the Club Hotel. The owner of this hotel, one W. Town, gave the name Kent Park to the area west of Dobson Street.

In the early 1900s, the of Kent Park were used for general grazing, farming, growing oats and keeping a variety of livestock.

A John Aitken bought Kent Park in 1913, selling most of the original purchase to a Mr Powell in 1921. The latter then sold to a Brigadier Knox, who in turn sold all except to Alex Creswick. In 1968/69, Hooker-Rex Estates purchased from the Creswick family, some for the current housing estate. The Education Department bought the land on which Kent Park primary school now stands; the school opened in February 1975.

Ferntree Gully Post Office opened on 1 January 1873. It was renamed Ferntree Gully South when the Lower Ferntree Gully Office opened (open since 1948) and was renamed Ferntree Gully. This office closed in 1997 through privatisation but opened next door soon after. The present Mountain Gate office opened in 1972 but was known as Ferntree Gully West for some months. Upper Ferntree Gully office opened in 1890.

==Community==

There is the Ferntree Gully library and community centre, where the Knox Festival is held in March every year (the alternative venue being in Rowville). Each December, the Knox Christmas Carols are held on the grounds of the Ferntree Gully football/Cricket club in Brenock Park Drive (now known as Wally Tew Reserve).

Notable community and retail sites in Ferntree Gully include the Coolstore on Dorset Road (which was owned and run by local orchardist Ken Dobson and his family for over 40 years until 2007), Woolworths Supermarket, Brennock Park Drive is one of the busiest in Australia, the Knox Environment Society (based at the rear of Ferntree Gully Secondary College, which closed at the end of 2006) and the Knox Historical Society (based at Ambleside Historical homestead). There are two pubs in Ferntree Gully, both on Burwood Highway—The Ferntree Gully Hotel (or &quot;The Middle&quot;) and the Club Hotel (the former Vass&#x27;s Pub).

Retirement villages include Amaroo on Burwood Highway and Glengollan on Underwood Road.

==Places of worship==
There are a number of groups providing for the local community. These include the Ferntree Gully Seventh Day Adventist Church in Upper Ferntree Gully, Hills Christian Life Church, Ferntree Gully Baptist Church, Ferntree Gully Independent Baptist Church, Armenian Catholic Church, Saint John the Baptist Catholic Church, Foothills Community Church, Olive Branch Fellowship, Salvation Army, Ferntree Gully Uniting Church and the Upper Gully Christadelphians
The former Churches of England, Methodist and Presbyterian were located in the Ferntree Gully Village in Station Street (C of E), at the intersection of Selman Avenue, The Avenue (M) and Francis Crescent (P). The Church of England moved to a new site on Burwood Highway near Burke Rd and recently merged with the Rowville church with the land being sold for housing.

==Sport==

There are a number of sports represented in Ferntree Gully including cricket, netball (the Mountain Districts Netball Association courts are based in Ferntree Gully), basketball (Knox City Basketball Centre &amp; Club ), Australian rules football (Ferntree Gully Eagles and Fairpark Lions compete in the Eastern Football League), tennis, swimming (Knox-Sherbrooke Swimming Centre), table tennis, lawn bowls and gymnastics (Knox Gymnastics Centre). A baseball complex is located in nearby Upper Ferntree Gully (Kings Park, Willow Road, Upper Ferntree Gully).

==Emergency services==

Ferntree Gully has one Ambulance Victoria station it holds up to three ambulances. In 2016, works started on upgrades at the time all Ambulance Victoria staff and Ambulances were moved to the CFA station. In 2017, the new station opened.

Ferntree Gully is home to a fully volunteer Country Fire Authority Fire Brigade established in 1942. Boasting two engine bays and four appliances and a services building at the rear it is one of the busiest volunteer stations in the state. It is backed up by other volunteer CFA Brigades in The Basin, Scoresby and Upper Ferntree Gully and including two permanent/volunteer stations in Boronia and Rowville.

==Schools==

In the immediate vicinity of Ferntree Gully Railway station is an abundance of schools. St John&#x27;s Primary School and St Josephs Secondary College and Ferntree Gully North Primary School are all within 10 minutes walk. There are also primary schools at Mountain Gate and Wattleview Primary school and Kent Park Primary School. It also has pre schools in the area.

===Education===

There are several primary schools — Wattleview Primary School, Eastern Ranges School, Ferntree Gully North Primary School, Kent Park Primary School, Mountain Gate Primary School, St John the Baptist Primary School, and Fairhills Primary School. The site of the former Ferntree Gully Primary school (Burwood Highway, Ferntree Gully) houses a number of buildings of historical significance for the area. The school itself closed at the end of the 2005 school year and has been developed as social housing.

There is one secondary school in Ferntree Gully—St Joseph&#x27;s College (A Catholic boys college in the care of the Salesians of Don Bosco for students in Years 7 – 12). There was another secondary school—Ferntree Gully Secondary College (for students in Years 7–12)—which closed at the end of the 2006 school year. The U3A (University of the Third Age) for retired persons is a co-operative education setting located in Ferntree Gully.

There are a number of kindergartens in Ferntree Gully including Bena Angliss Pre-school.

==Community groups==

Community groups include Ferntree Gully CFA volunteer fire brigade, Scouts at 1st Ferntree Gully and 4th Knox, Girl Guides and Rotary.

==Transport==

Ferntree Gully has a railway station located on Station Street, near the shopping district, which was previously known as Lower Ferntree Gully, followed by Fern Tree Gully, having been changed to the latter on 29 February 1972. The suburb is on the Belgrave railway line and it takes between 42 minutes (stopping all stations and then express service from Box Hill) to 60 minutes (all stations service) to Flinders Street, CBD.

A number of Melbourne bus routes also service the suburb which is run by Ventura bus lines and use the Ferntree Gully Railway station located on Station Street as a Terminus. The Railway station is a Premium fully staffed Metro station with PSOs after 6pm. There are 1000 car parking spaces. 108 trains pass through Ferntree Gully per day between Belgrave and the CBD with many running express from Box Hill to the city and express to Box hill on the way to Belgrave.

<doc id="547426" wikidata="Q318057" url="?curid=547426" title="Paolo Ruffini">
<text>Paolo Ruffini (22 September 1765 – 10 May 1822) was an Italian mathematician and philosopher.

== Education and career ==
By 1788 he had earned university degrees in philosophy, medicine/surgery and mathematics. His works include developments in algebra:
* an incomplete proof (Abel–Ruffini theorem) that quintic (and higher-order) equations cannot be solved by radicals (1799). Abel would complete the proof in 1824.
* Ruffini&#x27;s rule, which is a quick method for polynomial division.
* contributions to group theory.

He also wrote on probability and the quadrature of the circle.

He was a professor of mathematics at the University of Modena and a medical doctor including scientific work on typhus.

==Group theory==
In 1799 Ruffini marked a major improvement for group theory, developing Joseph-Louis Lagrange&#x27;s work on permutation theory (&quot;Réflexions sur la théorie algébrique des équations&quot;, 1770–1771). Lagrange&#x27;s work was largely ignored until Ruffini established strong connections between permutations and the solvability of algebraic equations. Ruffini was the first to assert, controversially, the unsolvability by radicals of algebraic equations higher than quartics, which angered many members of the community such as Gian Francesco Malfatti (1731–1807). Work in that area was later carried on by those such as Abel and Galois, who succeeded in such a proof.

==Publications==
* 1799: &quot;Teoria Generale delle Equazioni, in cui si dimostra impossibile la soluzione algebraica delle equazioni generali di grado superiore al quarto&quot; (&quot;General Theory of equations, in which the algebraic solution of general equations of degree higher than four is proven impossible&quot;)
* 1802: &quot;Riflessioni intorno alla rettificazione ed alla quadratura del circulo&quot; (&quot;reflections on the rectification and the squaring of the circle&quot;)
* 1802: &quot;Della soluzione delle equazioni algebraiche determinate particolari di grado superiore al quarto&quot; (&quot;on the solution of certain determined algebraic equations of degree higher than four&quot;)
* 1804: &quot;Sopra la determinazione delle radici nelle equazioni numeriche di qualunque grado&quot; (&quot;about the determination of the roots in the numerical equations of any degree&quot;)
* 1806: &quot;Della immortalità dell’anima&quot; (&quot;on the immortality of the soul&quot;)
* 1807: &quot;Algebra elementare&quot; (&quot;elementary algebra&quot;)
* 1813: &quot;Riflessioni intorno alla soluzione delle equazioni algebraiche generali&quot; (&quot;reflections on the algebraic solutions of equations&quot;)
* 1820: &quot;Memoria sul tifo contagioso&quot; (&quot;essay on contagious typhoid&quot;)
* 1821: &quot;Riflessioni critiche sopra il saggio filosofico intorno alle probabilità del signor conte Laplace&quot; (&quot;critical reflections on the philosophical essay about probability by Count Laplace&quot;)

<text>The Yukaghir languages ( or ; also &quot;Yukagir, Jukagir&quot;) are a small family of two closely related languages—Tundra and Kolyma Yukaghir—spoken by the Yukaghir in the Russian Far East living in the basin of the Kolyma River. At the 2002 Russian census, both Yukaghir languages taken together had 604 speakers. More recent reports from the field reveal that this number is far too high: Southern Yukaghir was reported to have had a maximum of 60 fluent speakers in 2009, while the Tundra Yukaghir language had around 60–70. The entire family, as such, is regarded as moribund. The Yukaghir have experienced a politically imposed language shift in recent times, resulting in a majority of speakers also speaking Russian and Yakut.

In the Russian 2020-2021 census, 516 people reported speaking a Yukaghir language as their native language.

==Classification and grammatical features==
The relationship of the Yukaghir languages with other language families is uncertain, though it has been suggested that they are distantly related to the Uralic languages, thus forming the putative Uralic–Yukaghir language family.

Michael Fortescue argued that Yukaghir is related to the Eskimo-Aleut languages along with Uralic languages, forming the Uralo-Siberian language family. 

Tundra and Kolyma Yukaghir are the only two remnants of what used to be one of the dominant languages/language families of northeastern Siberia, spreading from the River Anadyr in the east to the River Lena in the west. On the basis of the evidence of early sources, it can be assumed that there existed a Yukaghir dialect continuum, with what is today Tundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir at the extremes.

These two languages share only a relatively small part of the vocabulary and are not mutually intelligible. The basic grammatical structures, however, are very similar. Both languages have residual vowel harmony and a complex phonotactics of consonants. Both have rich agglutinative morphology and are strictly head-final. There is practically no finite subordination and very few coordinate structures. The most spectacular feature of TY and KY grammar is the split intransitive alignment system based on discourse-pragmatic features. In absence of narrow focus, the system is organised on the nominative–accusative basis; when focused, direct objects and subjects of intransitive verbs are co-aligned (special focus case, special focus agreement).

==Members==
The two extant varieties of Yukaghir are:
*Tundra Yukaghir (Northern Yukaghir, also known as Wadul): 30 to 150 speakers in 1989. Last spoken in the tundra belt extending between the lower Indigirka to the lower Kolyma basin (). Formerly spoken in a much wider area extending to the Lena basin in the west.
*Kolyma Yukaghir (Forest Yukaghir, Southern Yukaghir, also known as Odul): 5 to 10 speakers in 2009. Last spoken in the forest zone near the sources of the Kolyma, divided between the Sakha Republic and the Magadan Oblast (around ), previously in the wider area of the upper Kolyma region.

Extinct varieties include Omok and Chuvan, which survived until the 19th century.

<doc id="547435" wikidata="Q5154074" url="?curid=547435" title="William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy">
<text>William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy (8 November 1534), KG, of Barton Blount, Derbyshire, was an extremely influential English courtier, a respected humanistic scholar and patron of learning. He was one of the most influential and perhaps the wealthiest English noble courtier of his time. Mountjoy was known internationally as a humanist writer and scholar and patron of the arts.

==Origins==
William Blount was born circa 1478 in Barton Blount, Derbyshire, the eldest son of John Blount, 3rd Baron Mountjoy (c. 14501485) by his wife Lora Berkeley (died 1501), daughter of Edward Berkeley (died 1506) of Beverston Castle, Gloucestershire. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1485, Lora Berkeley remarried first Sir Thomas Montgomery (died 1495), and secondly Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond (died 1515), grandfather of Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire, father of Queen Anne Boleyn, second wife of King Henry VIII.

==Biography==
Blount was a pupil of Erasmus, who called him &quot;inter nobiles doctissimus&quot; (&quot;The most learned amongst the nobles&quot;). His friends included John Colet, Thomas More and William Grocyn.

In 1497 he commanded part of a force sent to fight and suppress the rebellion of Perkin Warbeck. Mountjoy was appointed and served as King Henry VIII&#x27;s boyhood tutor. In 1509 he was appointed Master of the Mint. In 1513 he was appointed Governor of Tournai (1513–1519), and his letters to Cardinal Wolsey and King Henry VIII describing his vigorous government of the town are preserved in the British Library.

In 1520 he was present with Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, and in 1522 at the king&#x27;s meeting with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. Having served since 1512 as Chamberlain to Queen Katherine of Aragon, it fell to him in that office to announce to her the intention of Henry VIII to divorce her. He also signed the letter to the Pope conveying the King&#x27;s threat to repudiate papal supremacy unless the divorce was granted. Mountjoy was one of the most influential and perhaps the wealthiest English noble courtier of his time. Sir William Blount, 4th Lord Mountjoy died on 8 November 1534 at Sutton-on-the-Hill, Derbyshire, England. Mountjoy was never disgraced, nor out of royal favour. His son Charles Blount, 5th Baron Mountjoy (1516–1544), was also a patron of learning.

==Family==
Mountjoy married four times:
*Firstly, about Easter 1497, Elizabeth Saye (died before 1506), daughter and co-heiress of Sir William Saye of Essenden, Hertfordshire, by whom he had a daughter:
**Gertrude Blount, later a lady in waiting to Queen Mary I (1553–1558), who on 25 October 1519 married Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter (1538), KG, PC, the eldest son of William Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon by his wife Katherine of York, daughter of King Edward IV. 
*Secondly, before the end of July 1509, Mountjoy married Inés de Venegas, one of the Spanish attendants or chamberers of Katherine of Aragon while she was Princess of Wales.
*Thirdly, before February 1515, Mountjoy married Alice Keble (died 8 June 1521), daughter of Henry Keble, Lord Mayor of London in 1510 and widow of Sir William Browne (died 1514), Lord Mayor of London in 1513. She died in 1521 and was buried at the Greyfriars, London. By Alice, he had children as follows:
**Charles Blount, 5th Baron Mountjoy (28 June 151610 October 1544), eldest son and heir, like his father also a successful English courtier and patron of learning.
**Katherine Blount (c. 1518 25 February 1559), who married firstly Sir John Champernowne of Modbury, Devon, and secondly Sir Maurice Berkeley (died 1581) of Bruton, Somerset. 
*Fourthly, before 29 July 1523, Mountjoy married Dorothy Grey (daughter of Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset by his wife, Cecily Bonville) and widow of Robert Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby de Broke. Dorothy Grey was the sister of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset (1477–1530), grandfather of Lady Jane Grey (1536/1537–1554). Dorothy, Lady Mountjoy, left a will proved 17 November 1553 (P.C.C. 20 Tasche). By Dorothy, Blount had the following children, all first-cousins-once-removed to Lady Jane Grey:
**John Blount
**Mary Blount, who married (as his first wife) Sir Robert Dennis, Knight (died 1592), of Holcombe Burnell in Devon.
**Dorothy Blount, who married John Blewett, Esq. (died 1585) of Holcombe Rogus in Devon.

Wantirna South is a border suburb to City of Whitehorse and City of Monash.

==History==

Wantirna South was mostly orchards until around 80 years ago. Demand for housing grew in the 1920s and Wantirna South and surrounding communities became a new place for housing development. One of the first buildings was Wantirna South Post Office, opened on 1 December 1936, but was renamed Studfield in 1990, being at the Studfield Shopping Centre. Wantirna South Primary School had a significant impact on the growth and housing around the Knox City area.

Several new residential estates have expanded residential dwelling capacity in Wantirna South. New facilities including a lake, shopping centre and various parks and community gardens have been established as a result. Like many suburbs around Melbourne, Knox has seen an increase in dwelling density with the construction of the new apartment complexes which is forecast to continue into the future.

==Facilities==

Wantirna South serves as the headquarters of the Knox City Council. The Knox City Council&#x27;s building was burnt down in 1994, and took a few years to be rebuilt. 

Another Wantirna South attraction is the Westfield Knox shopping centre, which was first built in the 1970s. It had a major refurbishment in 2002 to make it a more popular area for young people. This area is now known as Knox O-Zone, a popular night spot containing a pub, restaurants, clubs and cinema.

Knox Police Complex is situated on Burwood highway opposite Westfield Knox.

Another important building, across the road from the Knox Council headquarters, was the Rembrandts building. Rembrandts was a ballroom and formal eating place where social life took place, including over-28s and debutant balls from various schools. The building is now currently a part of St. Andrews Christian College.

There is also a skatepark in Wantirna South, which is located near Knox City Shopping Centre.

1st Wantirna South Scout Group has been a part of the community since the early 1950s. Wantirna South is also home to the Knox District Scout Centre, a popular venue for parties.

==Education==

Schools in Wantirna South include Knox Gardens Primary School, Knox Central Primary School, Knox Park Primary School, St Andrews Christian College, Waverley Christian College, Wantirna South Primary School and The Knox School. A campus of the Swinburne University of Technology is also located in Wantirna South.

==Sport==

The Wantirna WASPS Basketball club is the local basketball club. WASPS were established in 1988, and with over 70 boys and girls teams has grown to be the largest club competing in the Knox Basketball Association.

The Wantirna South Football Club, The Devils, competes in the Eastern Football League. The Knox Football Club, The Falcons, is situated next to Knox Gardens Primary School and also competes in the Eastern Football League.

<text>Starsky &amp; Hutch is a 2004 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Todd Phillips. The film stars Ben Stiller as David Starsky and Owen Wilson as Ken &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson and is a film adaptation of the original television series of the same name from the 1970s.

Two streetwise undercover cops in the fictional city of Bay City, California in 1975 bust drug criminals with the help of underworld boss Huggy Bear. The film is a prequel to the television series, as it portrays Starsky and Hutch first being partnered. The film also switches the personalities of the title characters. While in the television show, Starsky was curious and streetwise, and Hutch was by-the-book, in the film, Starsky is the serious cop, and Hutch is laid-back. There are four Frat Pack members in this film, although not all are in major roles.

The film was released on March 5, 2004, received mixed reviews from critics and was commercially successful, earning $170 million worldwide on a $60 million budget.

==Plot==
In 1975, two Bay City Police detectives, the macho David Starsky (who loves his 1974 Ford Gran Torino and recklessly pursues minor offenders) and the easy-going Ken &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson (who often works alongside criminals to investigate their activity) are forced to become partners as punishment for recent antics. Meanwhile, drug kingpin Reese Feldman and his right-hand man Kevin develop a new type of cocaine that is untraceable in scent and taste. When one of his dealers botches an operation, Feldman shoots him and dumps him in the bay.

The body washes ashore a few days later, and Starsky and Hutch investigate the scene. A clue leads them to Feldman, who denies any knowledge of the crime, but his wife mentions that the dealer had been dating a cheerleader. After meeting (and flirting with) cheerleaders Stacey and Holly, the detectives are given a jacket from cheerleader Heather (who disrobes in front of them, causing an embarrassing situation). Their street-wise informant Huggy Bear directs the pair to Big Earl&#x27;s motorcycle bar. Disguised as &quot;Captain America&quot; and &quot;Billy&quot; from &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, Starsky and Hutch learn that Big Earl is in jail, where they question him on his connection to Feldman&#x27;s illicit dealings. Big Earl forces the detectives into humiliating acts in exchange for information and a packet of what they believe is cocaine. However, Captain Doby, angered by their wild interrogation, takes them off the case, revealing that the packet was analyzed and found to contain only artificial sweetener.

The duo invite Stacey and Holly to Starsky&#x27;s place, where Starsky puts the “sweetener” in his coffee while Hutch sings &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up on Us&quot;. Starsky soon discovers that the contents of the packet were actually Feldman&#x27;s untraceable cocaine, and begins to feel the effects. The four visit a disco where Starsky, high on cocaine, loses a dance-off and tries to arrest his opponent. Hutch defuses the situation, takes Starsky home and puts him to bed, then proceeds to have a threesome with Stacey and Holly.

The duo are then attacked by another of Feldman&#x27;s dealers, causing damage to the Gran Torino, which a hungover Starsky is furious about. They visit the dealer&#x27;s apartment, only to be attacked again, this time by his knife-wielding young son. After they interrogate the dealer (and Starsky almost shoots himself in a game of Russian Roulette), they deduce that Feldman stores the drugs in his garage. They go undercover as mimes at his daughter&#x27;s Bat Mitzvah; confronting Feldman, Starsky shoots the lock off his garage door, inadvertently killing a pony inside that had been a gift for his daughter. Feldman hopes the botched operation will take heat off him, but Doby indefinitely suspends both detectives and reveals a complaint Starsky filed against Hutch weeks ago. Starsky tries to explain himself to Hutch, but an argument leads to a split in their friendship.

A bomb meant for Hutch instead injures his young neighbor Willis. Visiting him in the hospital, Starsky and Hutch reconcile and decide to shut down Feldman&#x27;s drug business. Aided by Huggy Bear, who grudgingly goes undercover as Feldman&#x27;s golf caddy, they learn that Feldman plans to sell the drugs at a charity ball by hiding them in Volkswagen Karmann Ghias to be given away to other dealers.

The duo enter the party in disguise with Stacey and Holly as their dates. Deducing Feldman&#x27;s plan, they shoot open the trunk of a Karmann Ghia on stage, revealing the large stash of cocaine. Feldman takes Hutch hostage, and Starsky, attempting to rescue him, accidentally shoots Captain Doby in the shoulder, though Hutch blames Reese. In the confusion, Feldman and his girlfriend Kitty escape with the money from the cocaine deal, leading Starsky and Hutch on a car chase through a golf course.

As Feldman and Kitty take off aboard a yacht, Starsky and Hutch pursue them to the end of the docks and jump the Gran Torino off a loading ramp, hoping to land it on the yacht. Instead, they overshoot and land in the water. The two manage to escape to safety, but the car sinks to the bottom of the bay and is lost. Meanwhile, Huggy, hiding on board the yacht, knocks Feldman out with a golf club and takes one of Feldman&#x27;s briefcases of money (and his sunglasses).

At a party celebrating the capture of Feldman, Starsky mourns the loss of his car. Huggy surprises him with another, identical Gran Torino (bought from the original Starsky and Hutch duo, David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser). The two partners roll out on another case in their new ride, driving triumphantly through the L.A. River as the credits roll.

<text>Wantirna is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 24 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Knox local government area. Wantirna recorded a population of 14,237 at the 2021 census.

Its name is derived from the local Aboriginal people’s expression for, &quot;a gurgling stream&quot;.

The Knox Private Hospital, Westfield Knox shopping centre, and Kieran are located in Wantirna.

The EastLink tollway runs through Wantirna with interchanges at Boronia Road and Burwood Highway.

Wantirna was first settled by Australians of European descent in 1840 when Mrs. Madeline Scott established the &quot;Bushy Park&quot; cattle run on the banks of the Dandenong Creek. During the 1870s other pioneers opened up the area to settlement. In 1912 the need for a school to serve the local area soon became apparent in this small but fast-growing area; the Finger family donated two acres of land on the southern side of Mountain Hwy (then known as Wantirna-Sassafras Rd) and a timber schoolhouse was opened. The Finger and Fankhauser families were prime movers in the erection of the Methodist Church opened opposite the school in May 1914, and a parish hall was built on Burwood Highway in 1924. Wantirna Post Office opened on 1 November 1913, closed in 1977, and reopened in 1983. The Wantirna Reserve was provided by the council in 1925 and a tennis court was built there shortly afterwards. In December 1939, after the outbreak of World War II, West Prussia Road was renamed Wantirna Road.

Locations in Wantirna, especially Westfield Knox, are occasionally used to shoot the soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Koomba Park is a large native bushland park spanning the area between Dandenong Creek and the Eastlink Tollway. It is run by Parks Victoria and was opened in 1982. The Victorian Jazz Archive is located in Koomba Park.

==Schools==

Schools in Wantirna include Wantirna Primary School, Wantirna College, Regency Park Primary School, Templeton Primary School and St Luke&#x27;s Primary School.

==Churches==
* Hills Bible Church

<doc id="547452" wikidata="Q1546270" url="?curid=547452" title="Gridiron football">
<text>Gridiron football ( ), also known as North American football, or in North America as simply football, is a family of team sports derived from rugby football (and football, by extension) primarily played in the United States and Canada.

American football, which uses 11 players, is the form played in the United States and the best known form of gridiron football worldwide, while Canadian football, which uses 12 players, predominates in Canada. Other derivative varieties include arena football, flag football and amateur games such as touch and street football. Football is played at professional, collegiate, high school, semi-professional, and amateur levels.

These sports originated in the 19th century out of older games related to modern rugby football, more specifically rugby union football. Early on, American and Canadian football developed alongside (but independently from) each other; the root of the game known as &quot;football&quot; today originates with an 1874 game between Harvard and McGill Universities, following which the American school adopted the Canadian school&#x27;s more rugby-like rules.

Over time, Canadian teams adopted features of the American variant of the game and vice versa. Both varieties are distinguished from other football sports by their use of hard plastic helmets and shoulder pads, the forward pass, the system of downs, a number of unique rules and positions, measurement in customary units of yards (even in Canada, which largely metricated in the 1970s), and a distinctive brown leather ball in the shape of a prolate spheroid with pointed ends.

The international governing body for the sport is the International Federation of American Football (IFAF); although the organization plays all of its international competitions under American rules, it uses a definition of the game that is broad enough that it includes Canadian football under its umbrella, and Football Canada (the governing body for Canadian football) is an IFAF member.

==Etymology==

The sport is typically known as simply &quot;football&quot; in the countries where it originated, regardless of the specific variety. In Europe, the sport is commonly known as &quot;American football&quot; as football usually refers to association football (&quot;soccer&quot;). Various sources use the term &quot;North American football&quot; when discussing the American and Canadian games together, but this term is quite rare. The International Federation of American Football (IFAF), uses &quot;American football&quot; inclusive of Canadian football and other varieties.

The two sports are also sometimes known as &quot;gridiron football&quot;. The name originated with the sport&#x27;s once-characteristic playing field: the original American football and Canadian football fields were marked by a series of parallel lines along both the width and length of the field, which produced a grid pattern resembling a cross-hatched cooking gridiron. The ball would be snapped in the grid in which it was downed on the previous play. By 1920, the grid system was abandoned in favor of the system of yard lines and hash marks used today. In Australia, American football is often referred to as &quot;gridiron&quot; or (in more formal contexts) &quot;American football&quot;, as &quot;football&quot; usually refers to Australian rules football, rugby league, or rugby union, similar to how association football is usually called &quot;soccer&quot; in Australian English. The governing body for American football in Australia is Gridiron Australia.

==History==
The sport developed from informal games played in North America during the 19th century. Early games had a variety of local rules and were generally similar to modern rugby union and soccer. The earliest recorded instance of gridiron football occurred at University of Toronto&#x27;s University College in November 1861.

Later in the 1860s, teams from universities were playing each other, leading to more standardized rules and the creation of college football. While several American schools adopted rules based on the soccer rules of the English Football Association, Harvard University held to its traditional &quot;carrying game&quot;. Meanwhile, McGill University in Montreal used rules based on rugby union. In 1874, Harvard and McGill organized two games using each other&#x27;s rules. Harvard took a liking to McGill&#x27;s rugby-style rules and adopted them. In turn, they were used when Harvard and Yale University played their first intercollegiate sports game in 1875, after which the rugby-style Canadian game was adopted by Yale players and spectators from Yale and Princeton University. This version of the game was subsequently played with several other U.S. colleges over the next several years.

American football teams and organizations subsequently adopted new rules which distinguished the game from rugby. Many of these early innovations were the work of Walter Camp, including the sport&#x27;s line of scrimmage and the system of downs. Another consequential change was the adoption of the forward pass in 1906, which allowed the quarterback to throw the ball forward over the line of scrimmage to a receiver. Canadian football remained akin to rugby for decades, though a progressive faction of players, chiefly based in the western provinces, demanded changes to the game based on the innovations in American football. Over the years, the sport adopted more Americanized rules, though it retained some of its historical features, including a field, 12-player teams, and three downs instead of four. Around the same time Camp devised the rules for American football, the Canadian game would develop in the same way (but separately) from the American game; the Burnside rules were instrumental in establishing many of the rules for the modern game.

==Versions==
* American football is the most common and widely known of these sports. It was originally more closely related to rugby, until various rule changes created by Camp were implemented in 1880, such as the system of downs, and the two sports diverged irreversibly after the forward pass was introduced to the American game in 1906. It is played with eleven players to a side, four downs and a field. The major professional league, the National Football League (NFL), has its own rule book. College football programs generally play under the code defined in the NCAA Football Rules and Interpretations; within the college football structure is sprint football, a variant of the game played solely by players who weigh less than the average college student at a small number of northeastern and midwestern universities in the United States. High schools generally follow the rules and interpretations published by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS), although some states follow the NCAA code for high school play. Youth games (below high school age) generally follow NFHS code with modifications. Adult semi-pro, alternative and minor professional, amateur, touch, flag, etc. may follow any one of these codes or use their own rules. While the vast majority of the game is the same among these three codes, subtle variations in rules can lead to large differences in play. Many of the differences are in penalty enforcement and the definitions of fouls.

* Canadian football is played almost exclusively in Canada. Like its American cousin, it was originally more closely related to rugby, until the Burnside rules were adopted in 1903 (as such, despite their similarities, the modern American and Canadian forms of football were developed separately from each other); the forward pass was adopted in Canada in 1929. The game is played on a field, has three downs, and twelve players to a side. The Canadian game also features a one-point &quot;single&quot; (formally called a &quot;rouge&quot;) for a ball kicked into or through the end zone and not returned by the receiving team. Like the American game, the Canadian Football League and U Sports both have their own rulebooks, although there are generally fewer differences than between their American counterparts.
* Nine-man football, eight-man football and six-man football are varieties of gridiron football played with fewer players. They are played with the same number of downs (often with a requirement for a new set of downs, as opposed to 10 in other codes), fewer offensive linemen, and an field. These games are generally based on the high school rulebooks, which have an addendum devoted to the play of these codes, and are generally played by teams from high schools with very small student bodies, usually in rural areas of the United States. Similar small-roster versions of Canadian football are played in rural Canada. Seven-man football formats have seen occasional adaptations, including the semi-professional American 7s Football League and the indoor Fan Controlled Football.
* Indoor football is played with special rules to accommodate smaller indoor facilities, usually sharing arenas with basketball or ice hockey teams. It is played on a field with, usually, eight players to a side. Prototype games were played in 1902 and 1932, both of which used the shortened field but followed the outdoor standard 11 to a side. However, indoor football did not gain popularity until James F. Foster&#x27;s proprietary version, arena football, debuted in 1986, and set most of the standards for indoor leagues today. As almost all indoor leagues are for-profit professional leagues, each league has its own proprietary code.
* Flag football is a variant of American football where, instead of tackling players to the ground, the defensive team must remove a flag or flag belt from the ball carrier (&quot;deflagging&quot;) to end a down, and contact is limited between players. The specific rules of flag football vary widely by the league, though all share in common their replication of the rules of traditional American football with tackling replaced by flag-pulling. Flag football will be an Olympic sport at the 2028 Summer Olympics.
* Touch football and backyard football are informal varieties of the game, played primarily at an amateur and recreational level. No specific rulebooks are universally recognized for these variants, where house rules usually apply.
* Wheelchair football is an adapted version of touch football for those with mobility-related disabilities. Rules vary based on organization but generally use a reduced number of players (six or seven) on a reduced size field (ranging from a basketball court to a 60-yard long field).
* Women&#x27;s American football is the organized play of the sport by women. Most organized leagues play by rules identical to male-dominated leagues. The former Lingerie Football League earned notoriety for its indoor, seven-on-seven variety of women&#x27;s football with minimal protective equipment and uniforms resembling women&#x27;s underwear; the Lingerie Football League was later reorganized and renamed Extreme Football League. Informal and amateur varieties of female-only games such as powderpuff, also exist. Given the popularity of gridiron football in North America yet the rarity of female-only teams at the high school level and above, female players have also played on men&#x27;s teams on rare occasions.

==Gameplay==

This is a minimal description of the game in general, with elements common to all or almost all variants of the game. For more specific rules, see each code&#x27;s individual articles.

Prior to the start of a game, a coin toss determines which team will decide if they want to kick off the ball to their opponent, or receive the ball from their opponent. Each team lines up on opposite halves of the field, with a minimum ten yards of space between them for the kickoff. The team receiving the ball can make a fair catch (which stops the play immediately), catch the ball and run it back until the ball carrier is tackled, or, if the ball is kicked out of bounds, let the ball go dead on its own (the last case usually happens when the ball is kicked all the way into or through the opponent&#x27;s end zone, resulting in a touchback and the ball being brought several yards out of the end zone to begin play). A kicking team can, under special circumstances, attempt to recover its own kick, but the rules of the game make it very difficult to do so reliably, and so this tactic is usually only used as a surprise or desperation maneuver.

At this point, play from scrimmage begins. The team in possession of the ball is on &quot;offense&quot; and the opponent is on &quot;defense&quot;. The offense is given a set amount of time (up to forty seconds, depending on the governing body), during which the teams can set up a play in a huddle and freely substitute players to set into a formation, in which the offense must remain perfectly still for at least one second (the formation requirement does not apply to Canadian football). At least half of the players (seven in standard American and Canadian football, four in standard indoor ball) on the offense must line up on the line of scrimmage in this formation, including the snapper, who handles the ball before play commences; the rest can (and almost always do) line up behind the line. Neither the offense nor the defense can cross the line of scrimmage before the play commences. Once the formation is set, the snapper snaps the ball to one of the players behind him. (A snapper must snap the ball within 20 to 25 seconds of the official setting the ball back into position after the previous play, and a play clock is kept to enforce the measure.) Once the ball is snapped, the play has commenced, and the offense&#x27;s goal is to continue advancing the ball toward their opponent&#x27;s end zone. This can be done either by running with the ball or by a rule unique to football known as the &quot;forward pass&quot;. In a forward pass, a player from behind the line of scrimmage throws the ball to an eligible receiver (another back or one player on each end of the line), who must catch the ball before it touches the ground. The play stops when a player with the ball touches any part of their body other than hand or foot to the ground, runs out of the boundaries of the field, is obstructed from making further forward progress, or a forward pass hits the ground without being caught (in the last case, the ball returns to the spot it was snapped). To stop play, players on defense are allowed to tackle the ball carrier at any time the ball is in play, provided they do not grab the face mask of the helmet or make helmet-to-helmet contact when doing so. At any time, the player with the ball can attempt a backward, or lateral, pass to any other player in order to keep the ball in play; this is generally rare. Any player on defense can, at any time, attempt to intercept a forward pass in flight, at which point the team gains possession; they can also gain possession by recovering a fumble or stripping the ball away from the ball carrier (a &quot;forced fumble&quot;). A typical play can last between five and twenty seconds.

If any illegal action happens during the play, then the results of the previous play are erased and a penalty is assessed, forcing the offending team to surrender between five and fifteen yards of field to the opponent. Whether this yardage is measured from the original spot of the ball before the play, the spot of the illegal action, or the end of the play depends on the individual foul. The most common penalties include &quot;false start&quot; (when an offensive player jumps to begin the play before the ball is snapped, a five-yard penalty), &quot;holding&quot; (the grabbing of a player other than the ball carrier to obstruct their progress; a ten-yard penalty against offensive players and a five-yard penalty against defensive ones), and &quot;pass interference&quot; (when either a receiver or the defending player pushes or blocks the other to prevent them from catching the pass). A team on offense cannot score points as the direct result of a penalty; a defensive foul committed in the team&#x27;s own end zone, if the penalty is assessed from the spot of the foul, places the ball at the one-yard line. In contrast, a defensive team can score points as a direct result of a penalty; if the offense commits a foul under the same scenario, the defensive team receives two points and a free kick. In all other circumstances (except for the open-ended and extremely rare unfair act clause), a penalty cannot exceed more than half the distance to the end zone. If the penalty would be less advantageous than the result of the actual play, then the team not committing the penalty can decline it.

In order to keep play moving, the offense must make a certain amount of progress (10 yards in most leagues) within a certain number of plays (3 in Canada, 4 in the United States), called downs. If the offense does indeed make this progress, a &quot;first down&quot; is achieved, and the team gets 3 or 4 more plays to achieve another 10 yards. If not, the offense loses possession to their opponent at the spot where the ball is. More commonly, however, the team on offense will, if they have a minimal chance of gaining a first down and have only one play left to do it (&quot;fourth down&quot; in the U.S., &quot;third down&quot; in Canada), attempt a &quot;scrimmage kick&quot;. There are two types of scrimmage kick: a punt is when the ball is released from the punter&#x27;s hand and kicked downfield as close to the opponent&#x27;s end zone as possible without entering it; the kicking team loses possession of the ball after the kick and the receiving team can attempt to advance the ball or call a fair catch. The other scrimmage kick is a field goal attempt. This must be attempted by place kick or (more rarely) drop kick, and if the kicked ball passes through the goal set at the edge of the opponent&#x27;s end zone, the team scores three points. (Four-point field goals have been offered in a few variations of the game under special rules, but the NFL, college and high school football only offer three-point field goals.) In Canada, any kick that goes into the end zone and is not returned, whether it be a punt or a missed field goal, is awarded one single point.

If the team in possession of the ball, at any time, advances (either by carrying or catching) the ball into the opponent&#x27;s end zone, it is a touchdown, and the team scores six points and a free play known as a try. In a try, a team attempts to score one or two points (rules vary by each league, but under standard rules, a field goal on a try is worth one point while another touchdown is worth two). At the college and professional levels, the defense can also score on a try, but only on the same scale (thus a botched try the defense returns for a touchdown scores only two points and not six). Kickoffs occur after every touchdown and field goal.

If a team is in its own end zone and commits a foul, is tackled with the ball, or bats, fumbles, kicks or throws the ball backward out of the field of play through the same end zone, the defense scores a safety, worth two points.

After a try, safety or field goal, the team that had possession of the ball goes back to the middle of the field and kicks the ball off to their opponent, and play continues as it did in the beginning of the game.

Play continues until halftime. (Each team switches their side of the field with the other halfway through each half, at the end of a quarter.) After the halftime break, a new kickoff occurs. Whichever team has more points at the end of the game is declared the winner; in the event of a tie, each league has its own rules for overtime to break the tie. Because of the nature of the game, pure sudden-death overtimes have been abolished at all levels of the game as of 2012.

At all adult levels of the game, a game is 60 timed minutes in length, split into four 15-minute quarters. (High school football uses 12-minute quarters, and the general rule is that the younger the players, the shorter the quarters typically are.) Because of the halftime, quarter breaks, time-outs, the minute warnings (two minutes before the end of a half in the NFL, three minutes in Canadian football), and frequent stoppages of the game clock (the clock stops, for example, after every incomplete pass and any time a ball goes out of bounds), the actual time it takes for a football game to be completed is typically over three hours in the NFL and slightly under three hours in the CFL.

==Injuries==

According to 2017 study on brains of deceased gridiron football players, 99% of tested brains of NFL players, 88% of CFL players, 64% of semi-professional players, 91% of college football players, and 21% of high school football players had various stages of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

Other common injuries include injuries of legs, arms and lower back.
