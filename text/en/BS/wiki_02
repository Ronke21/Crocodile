<text>DePaul University is a private Catholic research university in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Founded by the Vincentians in 1898, the university takes its name from the 17th-century French priest Saint Vincent de Paul. In 1998, it became the largest Catholic university in terms of enrollment in North America. Following in the footsteps of its founders, DePaul places special emphasis on recruiting first-generation students and others from disadvantaged backgrounds.

DePaul&#x27;s two campuses are located in Lincoln Park and the Loop. DePaul is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The university enrolls around 14,500 undergraduates and about 7,900 graduate/law students. In 2017, about 90% of DePaul&#x27;s students commuted or lived off campus. The student body represents a wide array of religious, ethnic, and geographic backgrounds, including over 118 foreign countries.

DePaul&#x27;s intercollegiate athletic teams, known as the DePaul Blue Demons, compete in the Big East Conference. DePaul&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team has made 18 NCAA tournament appearances and appeared in two Final Fours. DePaul&#x27;s softball team in 2019 had their third consecutive Big East Tournament title and 21st NCAA Tournament appearance in program history under head coach Tracie Adix-Zins.

==History==

===Early years===

Originally named St. Vincent&#x27;s College, DePaul University was founded in 1898 by the Congregation of the Mission priests and brothers, known as the Vincentians. Followers of 17th-century French priest Saint Vincent de Paul, they founded the university to serve children of Catholic immigrants. Student enrollment grew from 70 in 1898 to 200 in 1903 in what is now the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago.

In that year, James Quigley, Archbishop of Chicago, announced plans to create a preparatory seminary, now Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary, for the archdiocese and allow the Jesuit Saint Ignatius College, now Loyola University Chicago to move its collegiate programs to the north side, threatening St. Vincent College&#x27;s survival.

In response, the Vincentians re-chartered in 1907 as DePaul University, expressly offering all of its courses of study to men and women of any religious background. DePaul began admitting women in 1911 and awarded degrees to its first female graduates in 1912. It was one of the first Catholic universities to admit female students in a co-educational setting.

DePaul established the School of Music and the College of Commerce, the latter becoming one of the oldest business schools in the nation. In 1914, the college began offering courses in Chicago&#x27;s Loop, the precursor of DePaul&#x27;s second primary campus. In 1915, the Illinois College of Law completed its affiliation with the university and became the DePaul University College of Law. Enrollment totaled more than 1,100. 

Although finances were rocky, the university continued to grow and build in the 1920s. In 1926, the university was first accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Universities. When DePaul&#x27;s first sports teams were formed in the early 1900s, the monogram &quot;D&quot; was selected for the uniforms. From this originated the sports_nickname &quot;D-men&quot; which evolved into &quot;Demons&quot;. The color blue, which signifies loyalty and was chosen in 1901 by a vote of the student body, was added to the name to create the &quot;Blue Demons&quot;.

By 1930 more than 5,000 students were enrolled in eight colleges and schools on two campuses. The Great Depression led to fluctuations in enrollment and tuition as well as cutbacks, including the elimination of the football team in 1939. In 1938, the Department of Elementary Education was established, reportedly the only one in the Midwest and one of six in the United States.

===DePaul during the World Wars===
With the entry of the United States into World War I in 1918, DePaul formed a unit of the US Army Reserve Officer Training Corps and converted its College Theatre into Army barracks. DePaul also mobilized for World War II, offering its facilities for war training and free courses to train people for industry work. The G.I. Bill, which paid the tuition of veterans enrolled in college, turned the financial tide for DePaul. Enrollment in 1945 skyrocketed to 8,857 students, twice as many as the previous year, and totaled more than 11,000 in 1948. Although a consulting firm recommended relocating from its deteriorating Lincoln Park neighborhood to the suburbs, trustees voted to remain and support the revitalization of the neighborhood.

===1940s–1970s===

In 1942, DePaul named Ray Meyer as head basketball coach. Meyer coached for DePaul until he retired in 1984, leading the 1945 team to the championship of the National Invitation Tournament and earning numerous honors, including election to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1979, the fourth active coach to be so honored. The university would also go on to honor Ray Meyer by naming its fitness center after him.

In 1946, the Chicago-based American School of Physical Education merged into DePaul University.

In 1954, DePaul adopted its current armorial seal with coat of arms and motto: &quot;Viam sapientiae monstrabo tibi&quot; (&quot;I will show you the way of wisdom&quot;, Proverbs, IV, 11). In 1955, the Frank J. Lewis Foundation donated the 18-story Kimball Building, rechristened the Lewis Center, at 25 East Jackson Boulevard, to the university. The building, still used today, was the hub of the Loop campus until 1993 when the DePaul Center opened at 1 East Jackson Boulevard (at State Street).

In 1968, the Black Student Union (BSU) was formed. In 1969, while in ongoing negotiations with DePaul administrators, members of the group occupied a campus building for two days and led several related rallies. The actions helped bring concerns of black students, and later those of Latino, Muslim, and other student groups, to the fore. The university now sponsors a wide range of student organizations, including BSU, the DePaul Conservative Alliance, the DePaul Irish Society, the DePaul Alliance for Latino Empowerment, United Muslims Moving Ahead, Hillel, the Asian Cultural Exchange, the African Student Organization, the Hellenic-American Student Association, and the Activist Student Union.

In 1972, DePaul created the School for New Learning, one of the first colleges in the nation for adult students. In 1976 and 1977, the university acquired the land and buildings of the McCormick Theological Seminary, which increased its presence in Lincoln Park. In 1978, DePaul acquired the 47-year-old Goodman School of Drama from the Goodman Theatre and transformed it into The Theatre School.

===Renovation and expansion===
Following renovations in the 1980s and the expansion of academic programs to promote research and social engagement, the university launched a six-year strategic plan in 1989. The plan included raising the national profile, expanding enrollment from 13,500 to 18,500, and completing an extensive building campaign at the Loop and Lincoln Park campuses. Major construction included the renovation of the DePaul Center in 1993 and the acquisition of the Blackstone Theatre, rechristened the Merle Reskin, in 1992. At Lincoln Park, projects included the John T. Richardson Library, completed in 1992, several new residence halls, and the quadrangle. It was named after the university&#x27;s ninth president John T. Richardson.

DePaul&#x27;s 1994 enrollment was 16,700. Under the next six-year strategic plan, the university expanded enrollment to 23,000 students, reclaiming its status as the nation&#x27;s largest Catholic university while maintaining admission standards, increasing diversity (as of June 2006, one-third of the student population is of color), and maintaining access to first-generation college students and those from low-income circumstances (about one-fourth of incoming freshmen qualify for Pell grants for low-income families). Additional new facilities included the William G. McGowan Biological and Environmental Sciences Center (McGowan North) in 1999, the Ray Meyer Fitness and Recreation Center in 1999, the Student Center in 2001 and the Sullivan Athletic Center in 2000, and the Monsignor Andrew J. McGowan Environmental Science and Chemistry Building (McGowan South) in 2009.

A privately owned and operated building, 1237 West, was built one block off campus as a student apartment community for over 580 DePaul University students with retail businesses on the first floor. This building is now named Ion Lincoln Park.

DePaul entered into a merger with Barat College in 2001, from which it withdrew in 2005 after continued low enrollment and rising maintenance costs made the campus nonviable. The former Barat College had its final graduation on June 11, 2005. It sold the grounds of the 147-year-old college to a condominium developer Barat Woods LLC, who pledged to maintain the historic Old Main building, yet demolished the Thabor Wing with its Italianate-style Sacred Heart Chapel. The remaining students, tenured and tenure-track faculty, and some staff were absorbed into DePaul&#x27;s other campuses. Barat Woods LLC went into foreclosure and the property was auctioned and the lender, Harris Bank, won. The former Barat College campus was donated by an anonymous donor to Woodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart.

In 2012, a group of trustees and administrators of DePaul University was asked by the Archdiocese of Chicago and the priests and brothers of the Congregation of the Resurrection to assist Gordon Tech High School. As the academic partnership with the university progressed, the school became DePaul College Prep in 2014.

DePaul opened Wintrust Arena in October 2017 after using Allstate Arena for previous basketball games. The arena has a capacity of 10,387 seats and is the home court for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. DePaul University split the cost with Chicago taxpayers, with contributions of $82.5 million respectively. The predicted attendance to the arena was 370,000 people annually for games and other events. However, from August 2017 to May 2018, fewer than 168,100 people attended Wintrust Arena for their events.

===Controversies===
In 2005, the university limited fliers protesting a visit of Ward Churchill, which included the term &quot;hatemonger&quot;, declaring them &quot;propaganda&quot;. A bomb threat prompted the university to limit attendance at the event.

In the Dershowitz–Finkelstein affair of 2007, Norman Finkelstein, an outspoken political science professor, was denied tenure. This followed a highly public and rancorous evaluation process in which an opponent of Finkelstein, Alan Dershowitz, took the highly unorthodox step of sending unsolicited letters and dossiers to Finkelstein&#x27;s peers at DePaul urging them to deny him tenure. DePaul&#x27;s president, Dennis H. Holtschneider, denied that the outside pressure affected the university&#x27;s position. Finkelstein&#x27;s supporters claim he was denied tenure due to his writings on the Holocaust and on the state of the Palestinians under Israeli occupation. Detractors such as Dershowitz challenged Finkelstein&#x27;s research methods and confrontational approach. On September 5, 2007, Finkelstein resigned after he and the university reached a settlement; they released a joint statement.

In June 2009, the university removed the dean of the College of Law, Glen Weissenberger. The recommendation to remove Weissenberger was made by DePaul&#x27;s provost, Helmut Epp, who stated in an e-mail to College of Law faculty and staff that &quot;the working relationship between the dean and the administration had deteriorated to the point where it had become difficult to accomplish the college&#x27;s work&quot;. Two days previous, Weissenberger had reported to the American Bar Association (ABA) that DePaul&#x27;s administration had failed to redistribute law school tuition income appropriately, in violation of express agreements between the college and university. Weissenberger&#x27;s termination caused some DePaul faculty and students, as well as several independent observers in the law school community, to speculate that Weissenberger&#x27;s unexpected removal was directly related to his report to the ABA. The law school faculty apprised the ABA of irregularities in the removal of Weissenberger and the appointment of an interim dean, but the ABA did not find any violations that would warrant the rescission of the school&#x27;s accreditation.

In May 2016, activists disrupted the speech of right-wing political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos. The event was subsequently cancelled. Later that year, the university required a campus Republican group to redesign posters reading &quot;Unborn Lives Matter&quot; before granting permission to post them on the campus. University administrators said they objected to the poster because it was provocative toward the Black Lives Matter movement but that they were open to the group posting other pro-life flyers at DePaul.

In May 2024, the university fired adjunct professor Anne d’Aquino on the basis of an optional assignment on the human biology impacts of Palestinian genocide in the context of the Rafah offensive. The university later told &quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot; that the termination was related to an email d&#x27;Aquino sent students that was shared widely over social media. Representatives from the American Association of University Professors and Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression have suggested that the termination may violate academic freedom.

==Campuses==
DePaul&#x27;s two campuses are in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago and in the downtown Loop area. Owing largely to its compact urban form and its free public transportation passes for students, DePaul had the second lowest reported carbon footprint of any college and university submitting inventories under the College Sustainability Report Card program.

===Lincoln Park Campus===
DePaul&#x27;s Lincoln Park Campus (main campus) is the older and larger of the university&#x27;s two campuses. Located on in Chicago&#x27;s historic Lincoln Park neighborhood, this campus offers a traditional university environment. Approximately 2,400 students live on campus in DePaul&#x27;s twelve residence halls. Resident Halls Located at the Lincoln Park Campus include Belden-Racine Hall, Ozanam Hall (formerly Clifton-Fullerton), Corcoran Hall, Munroe Hall, Seton Hall, and University Hall. DePaul&#x27;s Lincoln Park Campus also offers other on-campus housing such as apartment-style living for upperclassmen.

The Lincoln Park Campus is home to the college of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences, The Theatre School, the School of Music, the College of Education, the College of Science and Health, the Schmitt Academic Center, Wish Field, and the John T. Richardson Library. Opened in 1992, the library features study and small-group spaces, an automated reference center, a technological help center, and a high-tech Resource Center for Career Development. The DePaul Art Museum, founded in 2011, is housed in a 15,000-square-foot building and features a collection of over 3000 objects, including works by Chicago and regional artists, North American and Latin American photography, WPA-era prints, contemporary and traditional West African objects, and Eastern European graphic arts. The museum is free to visit and open to the public.

In September 2013, DePaul opened its new Theatre School building, which includes the Watts Theatre, a 250-seat thrust theater, as well as the Sondra &amp; Denis Healy Theatre, a 100-seat flexible theater on the fourth floor. The building was designed by Pelli Clarke Pelli. In the fall of 2011, DePaul opened the four-story Arts &amp; Letters Hall, which earned a Gold LEED-certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. The three-level Student Center, which opened in 2002, houses student services, dining facilities, the Saint Louise de Marillac Chapel, a cyber cafe, a Wintrust Bank, and offices for organizations including special-interest clubs.

Other recent additions include the Sullivan Athletic Center containing McGrath-Phillips Arena, and the Ray Meyer Fitness and Recreation Center. The Monsignor Andrew J. McGowan Environmental Science and Chemistry Building (McGowan South) is a four-story building completed in January 2009. It is connected to the William G. McGowan Biological and Environmental Sciences Center (McGowan North). The Lincoln Park campus also contains the remnants of the former McCormick Theological Seminary; these buildings (those remaining) are located east of the elevated tracks. This expansion was completed in the 1970s when McCormick moved its campus to the Hyde Park neighborhood. The McCormick Row Houses along the south side of Fullerton Avenue east of the elevated station, though now privately owned, were originally constructed for the Seminary. Also, until its destruction in 2006, the gothic architecture Hayes-Healy Athletic Center adjacent to the Fullerton &#x27;L&#x27; station (similar in design to the still-present Cortelyou Commons next to Wish Field at Cacciatore Stadium) was also part of the Seminary campus. The gymnasium was demolished as part of the renovation/expansion of the Fullerton &#x27;L&#x27; stop to accommodate higher ridership levels on the Brown Line, despite being on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Loop Campus===
DePaul&#x27;s Loop campus is located in downtown Chicago&#x27;s Loop along Jackson Boulevard from State Street to Michigan Avenue. It is close to the financial district, and the Art Institute of Chicago. The DePaul Center (DPC), an 11-story building fully renovated in 1993 to include modern classrooms, high-tech student services, and a business library, is located in the building that formerly housed the A. M. Rothschild &amp; Company Store and the Goldblatt&#x27;s Department Store. It is home to the Driehaus College of Business.

The College of Law is based in the Lewis Center and O&#x27;Malley Place at the southwest corner of Wabash and Jackson. Kitty-corner across the street is the College of Computing and Digital Media. In 2008, DePaul purchased the 18-story 14 East Jackson Boulevard Building at State and Jackson, formerly the Lytton Building, across the street from the DePaul Center. The College of Communication, the School of Continuing and Professional Studies, and the School of Public Service were the first academic tenants of 14 East Jackson Boulevard, now the Richard M. and Maggie C. Daley Building.

DePaul partnered with Roosevelt University and Columbia College Chicago to build the University Center of Chicago, an 18-story residence hall two blocks south of DPC housing 1,700 students, which opened in 2004 at the intersection of State and Congress Streets. Robert Morris University later joined and also houses students in the University Center of Chicago.

==Academics==
DePaul operates on a quarter system, with the exception of the College of Law operating on a semester system.
===Undergraduate admissions===
In 2024, DePaul University accepted 73.5% of undergraduate applicants, with admission standards considered difficult, applicant competition considered low, and with those enrolled having an average 3.8 high school GPA.

The school&#x27;s only national championship came in 1945 after winning the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). DePaul has been to the NCAA tournament 22 times (two Final Four appearances) and the NIT tournament 16 times. The team played at the Allstate Arena from 1980 until 2017. Beginning in the 2017–2018 season, the team has played at Wintrust Arena. The men&#x27;s team has never won a conference championship since joining the Big East in 2005.

The school&#x27;s women&#x27;s basketball program has made the NCAA tournament 25 times, making them the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball team with the most appearances without ever reaching the Final Four. Even making it 18 times in a row between 2003 and 2022. They have been the Big East Conference tournament champions six times. Doug Bruno has been the team&#x27;s head coach for 39 seasons as of 2025 and is ranked #24 in terms of wins in NCAA womens basketball history.

<doc id="534128" wikidata="Q272197" url="?curid=534128" title="Æthelheard of Wessex">
<text>Æthelheard (meaning roughly &quot;Noble Stern&quot;), also spelled Ethelheard, Edelard or Æþelheard, was King of Wessex from 726 to 740. There is an unreliable record of Æthelheard having been the brother-in-law of his predecessor, Ine, but his ancestry is unknown, perhaps making him the first King of Wessex not to be descended from Cynric by blood.

Some sources identify him as the brother of Queen Æthelburg of Wessex, the wife of his predecessor, King Ine. His own successor Cuthred is identified in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; as &#x27;his relative&#x27;.

When Ine abdicated and went to Rome in 726, he left behind no obvious heir, and according to Bede simply left his kingdom &quot;to younger men&quot;. In the wake of his departure, the West Saxon throne was disputed between Æthelheard and a rival claimant, Oswald. Oswald may have had the better claim, as the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; calls him a descendant of the early king Ceawlin, but it was Æthelheard who prevailed. It is possible that his success was due to the support of Æthelbald of Mercia since he seems to have been subject to Æthelbald afterward. However, Æthelheard&#x27;s lack of independence does not seem to have prevented Æthelbald from taking considerable territory from Wessex in 733, including the royal manor of Somerton.

Æthelheard married Frithugyth in 729 or before and she is recorded in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; as making a pilgrimage to Rome in 737.

Æthelheard was succeeded by Cuthred, possibly a brother or other relative.

<text>In anatomy, a nasal concha (; : conchae; ; Latin for &#x27;shell&#x27;), also called a nasal turbinate or turbinal, is a long, narrow, curled shelf of bone that protrudes into the breathing passage of the nose in humans and various other animals. The conchae are shaped like an elongated seashell, which gave them their name (Latin &quot;concha&quot; from Greek &quot;κόγχη&quot;). A concha is any of the scrolled spongy bones of the nasal passages in vertebrates.

In humans, the conchae divide the nasal airway into four groove-like air passages, and are responsible for forcing inhaled air to flow in a steady, regular pattern around the largest possible surface area of nasal mucosa. As a ciliated mucous membrane with shallow blood supply, the nasal mucosa cleans, humidifies and warms the inhaled air in preparation for the lungs.

A rapidly dilating arteriolar circulation to these bones may lead to a sharp increase in the pressure within, in response to acute cooling of the body core. The pain from this pressure is often referred to as &quot;brain freeze&quot;, and is frequently associated with the rapid consumption of ice cream. The shallowness of the venous blood supply of the mucosa contributes to the ease with which nosebleed can occur.

==Structure==
Conchae are composed of pseudostratified columnar, ciliated respiratory epithelium with a thick, vascular, and erectile glandular tissue layer. The conchae are located laterally in the nasal cavities, curling medially and downward into the nasal airway. Each pair is composed of one concha in either side of the nasal cavity, divided by the septum.

The &quot;superior conchae&quot; are smaller structures, connected to the middle conchae by nerve-endings, and serve to protect the olfactory bulb. The superior conchae attach to the ethmoid bone. The openings to the posterior ethmoidal sinuses exist under the superior meatus. The sphenoid sinus ostium exists medial to the superior turbinate.

The &quot;middle conchae&quot; are smaller but have the most complex anatomy of the nasal turbinates. They originate from the lateral edge of the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone. They insert anteriorly into the frontal process of the maxilla and posteriorly into the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone. There are three mutually perpendicular segments of the middle turbinate: from proximal to distal, there is the horizontal segment (axial plane), the basal lamella (coronal plane), and the vertical segment (sagittal plane). They project downwards over the openings of the maxillary and anterior and middle ethmoid sinuses, and act as buffers to protect the sinuses from coming in direct contact with pressurized nasal airflow. Most inhaled airflow travels between the inferior concha and the middle meatus. In humans, they are usually as long as the little finger.

The &quot;inferior conchae&quot; are the largest turbinates, can be as long as the index finger in humans, and are responsible for the majority of airflow direction, humidification, heating, and filtering of air inhaled through the nose.

The &quot;inferior conchae&quot; are graded 1–4 based on the inferior concha classification system (known as the &quot;inferior turbinate classification system&quot;) in which the total amount of the airway space that the inferior concha takes up is estimated. Grade 1 is 0–25% of the airway, grade 2 is 26–50% of the airway, grade 3 is 51–75% of the airway and grade 4 is 76–100% of the airway.

There is sometimes a pair of &quot;supreme conchae&quot; superior to the superior conchae. When present, these usually take the form of a small crest.

==Function==
The conchae comprise most of the mucosal tissue of the nose and are required for functional respiration. They are enriched with airflow pressure and temperature-sensing nerve receptors (linked to the trigeminal nerve route, the fifth cranial nerve), allowing for tremendous erectile capabilities of nasal congestion and decongestion, in response to the weather conditions and changing needs of the body. In addition, the erectile tissue undergoes an often unnoticed cycle of partial congestion and decongestion called the nasal cycle. The flow of blood to the nasal mucosa in particular the venous plexus of the conchae is regulated by the pterygopalatine ganglion and heats or cools the air in the nose.

The nasopulmonary and nasothoracic reflexes regulate the mechanism of breathing through deepening of inhalation. Triggered by the flow of the air, the pressure of the air in the nose, and the quality of the air, impulses from the nasal mucosa are transmitted by the trigeminal nerve to the breathing centres in the brainstem, and the generated response is transmitted to the bronchi, the intercostal muscles, and the diaphragm.

The conchae are also responsible for filtration, heating, and humidification of air inhaled through the nose. Of these three, filtration is achieved mostly by other more effective means such as mucus and cilia. As air passes over the conchae, it is heated to 32–34 °C (89–93 °F), humidified (up to 98% water saturation) and filtered.

===Immunological role===
The respiratory epithelium that covers the erectile tissue (or lamina propria) of the conchae plays a major role in the body&#x27;s first line of immunological defense. The respiratory epithelium is partially composed of mucus-producing goblet cells. This secreted mucus covers the nasal cavities, and serves as a filter, by trapping air-borne particles larger than 2 to 3 micrometers. The respiratory epithelium also serves as a means of access for the lymphatic system, which protects the body from being infected by viruses or bacteria.

===Smell===
The conchae provide, first and foremost, the humidity needed to preserve the delicate olfactory epithelium, which in turn is needed to keep the olfactory receptors healthy and alert. If the epithelial layer gets dry or irritated, it may cease to function. This is usually a temporary condition but, over time, may lead to chronic anosmia. The turbinates also increase the surface area of the inside of the nose, and, by directing and deflecting airflow across the maximum mucosal surface of the inner nose, they are able to propel the inspired air. This, coupled with the humidity and filtration provided by the conchae, helps to carry more scent molecules towards the higher, and very narrow regions of the nasal airways, where olfaction nerve receptors are located.

The superior conchae completely cover and protect the nerve axons piercing through the cribriform plate (a porous bone plate that separates the nose from the brain) into the nose. Some areas of the middle conchae are also innervated by the olfactory bulb. All three pairs of conchae are innervated by pain and temperature receptors, via the trigeminal nerve (or, the fifth cranial nerve). Research has shown that there is a strong connection between these nerve endings and activation of the olfactory receptors, but science has yet to fully explain this interaction.

==Clinical significance==

===Dysfunction===
Large, swollen conchae, often referred to clinically as turbinates, may lead to blockage of nasal breathing. Allergies, exposure to environmental irritants, or a persistent inflammation within the sinuses can lead to turbinate swelling. Deformity of the nasal septum can also result in enlarged turbinates.

Treatment of the underlying allergy or irritant may reduce turbinate swelling. In cases that do not resolve, or for treatment of deviated septum, turbinate surgery may be required.

===Surgery===
Turbinate reduction is a surgery to reduce the size of the turbinates (typically inferior turbinates). There are different techniques, including bipolar radiofrequency ablation (also known as somnoplasty), electrocautery, and use of cold steel instruments (e.g. microdebrider).

In the case of turbinate reduction, only small amounts of turbinate tissue are removed because the turbinates are essential for respiration. Turbinectomy is usually reserved for patients who have persistent symptoms despite previous turbinate reduction surgery. Risks of reduction of the inferior or middle turbinates include empty nose syndrome. As Steven M. Houser suggested, &quot;this is especially true in cases of anterior inferior turbinate (IT) resection because of its important role in the internal nasal valve.&quot;

Concha bullosa is an abnormal pneumatization of the middle turbinate, which may interfere with normal ventilation of the sinus ostia and can result in recurrent sinusitis. In some cases, the concha bullosa may be resected to help resolve persistent symptoms.

==Other animals==
Generally, in animals, nasal conchae are convoluted structures of thin bone or cartilage located in the nasal cavity. These are lined with mucous membranes that can perform two functions. They can improve the sense of smell by increasing the area available to absorb airborne chemicals, and they can warm and moisten inhaled air, and extract heat and moisture from exhaled air to prevent desiccation of the lungs. Olfactory turbinates are found in all living tetrapods, and respiratory turbinates are found in most mammals and birds.

Animals with respiratory turbinates can breathe faster without drying out their lungs, and consequently can have a faster metabolism. For example, when the emu exhales, its nasal turbinates condense moisture from the air and absorbs it for reuse. Dogs and other canids possess well-developed nasal turbinates. These turbinates allow for heat exchange between small arteries and veins on their (turbinates positioned on maxilla bone) surfaces in a counter-current heat-exchange system. Dogs are capable of prolonged chases, in contrast to the ambush predation of cats, and these complex turbinates play an important role in enabling this (cats only possess a much smaller and less-developed set of nasal turbinates). This same complex turbinate structure help conserve water in arid environments. The water conservation and thermoregulatory capabilities of these well-developed turbinates in dogs may have been crucial adaptations that allowed dogs (including both domestic dogs and their wild prehistoric gray wolf ancestors) to survive in the harsh Arctic environment and other cold areas of northern Eurasia and North America, which are both very dry and very cold.

Reptiles and more primitive synapsids have olfactory turbinates that are involved in sensing smell rather than preventing desiccation. While the maxilloturbinates of mammals are located in the path of airflow to collect moisture, sensory turbinates in both mammals and reptiles are positioned farther back and above the nasal passage, away from the flow of air. &quot;Glanosuchus&quot; has ridges positioned low in the nasal cavity, indicating that it had maxilloturbinates that were in the direct path of airflow. The maxilloturbinates may not have been preserved because they were either very thin or cartilaginous. The possibility has also been raised that these ridges are associated with an olfactory epithelium rather than turbinates. Nonetheless, the possible presence of maxilloturbinates suggests that &quot;Glanosuchus&quot; may have been able to rapidly breathe without drying out the nasal passage, and therefore could have been an endotherm.

The bones of nasal turbinates are very fragile and seldom survive as fossils. In particular none have been found in fossil birds. But there is indirect evidence for their presence in some fossils. Rudimentary ridges like those that support respiratory turbinates have been found in advanced Triassic cynodonts, such as &quot;Thrinaxodon&quot; and &quot;Diademodon&quot;. This suggests that they may have had fairly high metabolic rates. The paleontologist John Ruben and others have argued that no evidence of nasal turbinates has been found in dinosaurs. All the dinosaurs they examined had nasal passages that they claimed were too narrow and too short to accommodate nasal turbinates, so dinosaurs could not have sustained the breathing rate required for a mammal-like or bird-like metabolic rate while at rest, because their lungs would have dried out. However, objections have been raised against this argument. Nasal turbinates are absent or very small in some birds, such as ratites, Procellariiformes and Falconiformes. They are also absent or very small in some mammals, such as anteaters, bats, elephants, whales and most primates, although these animals are fully endothermic and in some cases very active. Furthermore, ossified turbinate bones have been identified in the ankylosaurid dinosaur &quot;Saichania&quot;.

<text>John Clemens Ryan (born October 6, 1959) is an American businessman, former investment banker and politician who was a candidate in the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois. In 2000, he retired as an active partner at Goldman Sachs to teach at Hales Franciscan High School, a private Catholic high school in Chicago&#x27;s Bronzeville neighborhood.

His 2004 campaign for the Senate, against Barack Obama, received widespread media attention for the disclosure of sealed custody documents stemming from his divorce from actress Jeri Ryan. The unsealing of those documents detailed allegations that Ryan wanted his wife to perform sexual acts in public which in turn led to Ryan&#x27;s withdrawal from the campaign.

In March 2005, Ryan launched 22nd Century Media, a news media company dedicated to providing hyper-local news in both print and digital media formats. In 2015, Ryan left 22nd Century Media to launch REX, a technology-based real estate services company that works outside the MLS to sell homes. The value proposition of REX was to reduce the cost of real estate commissions from the customary 6% to 3.3%. This led to a legal battle with Zillow and the National Association of Realtors that responded by dismantling their commission structure to move away from the market-dominating 6% commission structure which CNN called &quot;seismic&quot; in its implications.

==Early life==
Ryan spent his childhood in Wilmette, Illinois, the son of Helen Marie (Bruns) and Donald Robert Ryan, a managing partner at a trade and clearing house. One of six siblings, he attended New Trier High School. He graduated from high school in 1977 and went on to receive his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College. Ryan later earned his MBA from Harvard Business School and his JD from Harvard Law School. 

==Professional history==
Ryan worked at Casa Juan Diego, a refugee camp for Latinos fleeing the Central American civil wars in 1981. He worked for Goldman Sachs as an investment banker and eventual partner, first in New York City, and then in the Chicago branch. During his tenure there he took on a client acquisition role, contacting prominent CEOs about hiring his firm to examine the internal numbers of a company&#x27;s business, subsidiaries, and divisions down to the most minute detail.

In 2000, after Goldman Sachs went public, Ryan&#x27;s net worth was in the tens of millions. He retired from Goldman as a partner and taught for three years at Hales Franciscan High School in Chicago. He left his teaching position to run for the Senate in 2004.

=== Local Journalism - 22nd Century Media ===
Starting in 2005, he ran 22nd Century Media, which published 15 separate localized newspapers and websites in the Chicago area. Following his political career, Ryan resumed his newspaper business. On February 27, 2014, he launched the &quot;Highland Park Landmark&quot;, the 12th hyper-local news publication published by his company, 22nd Century Media, and the fifth hyper-local product to serve Chicago&#x27;s North Shore suburbs. When asked why he chose to enter the news media industry, Ryan told the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, &quot;I was committed to improving the communities in which we live, and our profession seemed like a very good way to do so.&quot; Ryan also related that while at Goldman Sachs, he had observed how large retailer chains lost business to &quot;category killers&quot; whose specialization in specific products allowed them dominate those markets, as Best Buy and Toys R Us, for example, did with electronics and toys, respectively. Feeling that a similar process would take place with the various sections of traditional newspapers, Ryan believed that he was suited for work in local journalism. He believed that the way the media handled the scandal that ended his political career showed that there were ways in which that profession could be improved.

=== Real Estate Industry ===
He runs REX, a technology-based real estate services company that works outside the MLS to sell homes. At its launch in 2015 it advertised transaction commissions of 1% instead of the 6% industry standard. Ryan has dedicated the wealth created from the venture to building homes and schools for children. As part of its social mission, for every 50 homes it sells, REX builds a home for someone who doesn&#x27;t have one.

In 2021, REX filed an antitrust lawsuit against Zillow, Trulia, and the National Association of Realtors seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief for alleged anti-competitive practices. 

==2004 U.S. Senate race==

Ryan hoped to succeed retiring Republican Peter Fitzgerald in the United States Senate. On March 16, 2004, he won the Republican primary, pitting him against Democrat Barack Obama. However, after his divorce records containing damaging allegations were unsealed and made public, he announced his decision to withdraw his candidacy on June 25, 2004, and officially filed the documentation to do so on July 29. During his Senate campaign, Ryan supported across-the-board tax cuts, tort reform, and reductions in federal spending, and was a proponent of equal opportunity in education.

In 2004, Ryan&#x27;s staff had Justin Warfel (a campaign worker) follow Barack Obama throughout the day and record everything he did in public on videotape. The tactic backfired when Barack Obama and others, including Ryan&#x27;s supporters, criticized this activity. Ryan&#x27;s spokesman apologized and promised that Warfel would give Obama more space. Obama said he was satisfied with Ryan&#x27;s decision.

===Campaign demise===
Ryan married actress Jeri Ryan (née Zimmerman) in 1991; together they have a son, Alex Ryan, born 1994. They divorced in 1999 in California, and the records of the divorce were open but their custody documents were sealed at their joint request. Five years later, when Ryan&#x27;s Senate campaign began, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper and WLS-TV, the local ABC affiliate, sought to have the records released. On March 3, 2004, several of Ryan&#x27;s GOP primary opponents urged release of the records. Both Ryan and his wife had agreed to make their divorce records public but keep the custody records sealed, claiming that their release could be harmful to their son. On March 16, 2004, Ryan won the GOP primary with 36 percent to 23 percent against businessman and perennial political candidate Jim Oberweis, who came in second. Obama won the Democratic primary, with 53 percent to 23 percent against Dan Hynes, who came in second.

On March 29, 2004, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert Schnider ruled that several of the Ryans&#x27; custody records should be opened to the public despite the parties&#x27; mutual agreement to keep the records sealed. The following week, on April 2, 2004, Barack Obama called on Democrats not to inject them into the campaign. The Ryan campaign characterized Obama&#x27;s stance as hypocritical because people they alleged to be Obama&#x27;s backers had been emailing reports about the divorce records before Judge Schnider&#x27;s decision and urging the press to seek to open them.

In May 2004, a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; poll found Ryan trailing Obama 52% to 30%. On June 22, 2004, after receiving a report from the referee, Judge Schnider released the files that were deemed consistent with the interests of Ryan&#x27;s young child. In those files, Jeri Ryan alleged that Jack Ryan had wanted her to perform sexual acts with him in public in sex clubs in New York City, New Orleans, and Paris, but no sex occurred. Jeri Ryan described one as &quot;a bizarre club with cages, whips and other apparatus hanging from the ceiling.&quot; The decision to release these files generated much controversy because it went against both parents&#x27; direct request, and because it reversed the earlier decision to seal the papers in the best interest of the child, who had special needs. On the same day, Jim Oberweis, Ryan&#x27;s defeated opponent in the GOP primary, commented that if the allegations were true, &quot;it would end the candidacy.&quot;

Ryan&#x27;s campaign indeed ended less than a week after the custody records were opened, and Ryan officially filed the documentation to withdraw on July 29, 2004. The same party leaders who called for Ryan&#x27;s resignation chose Alan Keyes as Ryan&#x27;s replacement in the race; Keyes lost to Obama, 27% to 70%.

===Ryan&#x27;s response===
Subsequent to his withdrawal from the U.S. Senate race in Illinois, Jack Ryan has characterized what happened to him as a &quot;new low for politics in America.&quot; According to Ryan, it was unprecedented in American politics for a newspaper to sue for access to sealed custody documents. Ryan opposed unsealing the divorce records of Senator John Kerry during Kerry&#x27;s race against George W. Bush in 2004, and Kerry&#x27;s divorce records remained sealed. Ryan subsequently made a statement requesting &quot;Let me be the only person this has happened to. Don&#x27;t ask for Ted Kennedy&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t ask for John McCain&#x27;s. Don&#x27;t ask for Joe Lieberman&#x27;s. Just stop. This is not a good precedent for American society if you really want the best and brightest to run.&quot;

<doc id="534152" wikidata="Q33025" url="?curid=534152" title="Beja language">
<text>Beja ( or ) is an Afroasiatic language of the Cushitic branch spoken on the western coast of the Red Sea by the Beja people. Its speakers inhabit parts of Egypt, Sudan and Eritrea. In 2022 there were 2,550,000 Beja speakers in Sudan, and 121,000 Beja speakers in Eritrea according to Ethnologue. As of 2023 there are an estimated 88,000 Beja speakers in Egypt. The total number of speakers in all three countries is 2,759,000.
==Name==
The name &quot;Beja&quot;, derived from , is most common in English-language literature. Native speakers use the term (indefinite) or (definite).

==Classification==
Beja is held by most linguists to be part of the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic family, constituting the only member of the Northern Cushitic subgroup. As such, Beja contains a number of linguistic innovations that are unique to it, as is also the situation with the other subgroups of Cushitic (e.g. idiosyncratic features in Agaw or Central Cushitic). The characteristics of Beja that differ from those of other Cushitic languages are likewise generally acknowledged as normal branch variation.

The relation of the Northern Cushitic branch of Cushitic to the other branches is unknown. Christopher Ehret proposes, based on the devoicing of Proto-Cushitic voiced velar fricatives, that Northern Cushitic is possibly more closely related to South Cushitic than to the other branches.

The identification of Beja as an independent branch of Cushitic dates to the work of Enrico Cerulli between 1925 and 1951. Due to Beja&#x27;s linguistic innovations, Robert Hetzron argued that it constituted an independent branch of Afroasiatic. Hetzron&#x27;s proposal was generally rejected by other linguists, and Cerulli&#x27;s identification of Beja as the sole member of a North Cushitic branch remains standard today across otherwise divergent proposals for the internal relations of the Cushitic language family.

==History==
Christopher Ehret proposes the following sequence of sound changes between Proto-Cushitic and Beja:
# PC * → * (alveolar ejective affricate becomes palatal ejective stop)
# PC * → * (dental ejective stop becomes alveolar ejective affricate)
# *C&#x27; → C (ejectives become their non-ejective voiceless counterparts)
# [+lateral/+obstruent] → [+retroflex/+obstruent] (that is, and become and , respectively)
# PC * → * (voiced alveolar affricate becomes voiceless)
# * → ; * → (voiceless alveolar affricate becomes a fricative, voiceless palatal plosive becomes a postalveolar fricative
# PC * → * (labialized voiced velar fricative becomes voiceless)
# * → * (velar fricatives become plosives)
# PC * → /V_V (lateral fricative becomes alveolar tap between vowels)
# PC * → /#_ (lateral fricative becomes lateral approximant word-initially)
# PC *z → /V_ (a consonant of unknown value becomes palatal approximant after vowels)
# PC *z → /#_ (the same consonant of unknown value becomes voiced alveolar stop word-initially)
# PC *, * → (all nasals but collapse into alveolar nasal)

Ehret&#x27;s reconstructed Proto-Cushitic /z/ is not a voiced alveolar fricative, but a consonant of unknown value. Ehret proposes that it might be a voiced palatal plosive .

Some linguists and paleographers believe that they have uncovered evidence of an earlier stage of Beja, referred to in different publications as &quot;Old Bedauye&quot; or &quot;Old Beja.&quot; Helmut Satzinger has identified the names found on several third century CE ostraca (potsherds) from the Eastern Desert as likely Blemmyan, representing a form of Old Beja. He also identifies several epigraphic texts from the fifth and sixth centuries as representing a later form of the same language. Nubiologist Gerald Browne, Egyptologist Helmut Satzinger, and Cushiticist Klaus Wedekind believed that an ostracon discovered in a monastery in Saqqarah also represents the Old Beja language. Browne and Wedekind identified the text as a translation of Psalm 30.

==Phonology==
Nasals other than and are positional variants of . The consonants and only appear in Arabic loanwords in some speakers&#x27; speech; in others&#x27;, they are replaced by or and . Some speakers replace in Arabic loanwords with .

Beja has the five vowels , , , , and . and only appear long, while , , and have long and short variants.

Beja has pitch accent.

==Orthography==
Both Roman and Arabic script have been used to write Beja. The Roman orthography below is that used by the Eritrean government and was used in a literacy program at Red Sea University in Port Sudan from 2010 to 2013. Three Arabic orthographies have seen limited use: The first below was that used by the now defunct Website Sakanab; the second was devised by Muhammad Adaroob Muhammad and used in his translation of E.M. Roper&#x27;s Beja lexicon; the third was devised by Mahmud Ahmad Abu Bikr Ooriib, and was employed briefly at Red Sea University in 2019. No system of writing has gained wide support. The only system to have been employed in publications by more than one writer is the Latin script.

In the Roman orthography, the vowels are written with the letters corresponding to the IPA symbols (i.e., ). Long vowels are written with doubled signs. As and cannot be short vowels, they only appear as and , respectively.

The single sign, however, does have a use: To distinguish between and , is used for the former and for the latter. Similarly, is , is , is . Single is not used.

In all Arabic orthographies, short vowels are written with the same diacritics used in Arabic: fatḥah for (), kasrah for (), ḍammah for (). &#x27;Alif (ا) is used as the seat for these diacritics at the beginning of a word. Long is written with &#x27;alif () preceded by fatḥah, or alif maddah () when word-initial. Long is written with yā&#x27; preceded by kasrah. Long is written with wāw preceded by ḍammah. The systems vary on the representation of long and long . In the Usakana system, is written with a modified Kurdish yā&#x27; ; in the system devised by Muhammad Adaroob Muhammad it is represented by yā&#x27; with a shaddah ; in the Red Sea University system, it is not distinguished from the yā&#x27; for or . In the Usakana system, is written with a modified Kurdish wāw ; in the system devised by Muhammad Adaroob Muhammad it is represented by wāw with a shaddah ; in the Red Sea University system, it is not distinguished from the wāw for or .

Pitch accent is not marked in any orthography. In Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa (2006 and 2007), stressed syllables are indicated in boldface.

In addition to these two systems and several academic systems of transcribing Beja texts, it is possible that Beja was at least occasionally written in the Greek alphabet-based Coptic script during the Middle Ages.

==Grammar==
===Nouns, articles, and adjectives===
Beja nouns and adjectives have two genders: masculine and feminine, two numbers: singular and plural, two cases: nominative and oblique, and may be definite, indefinite, or in construct state. Gender, case, and definiteness are not marked on the noun itself, but on clitics and affixes. Singular-plural pairs in Beja are unpredictable.

====Plural forms====
Plurals may be formed by:
* the addition of a suffix to the singular stem: &#x27;house&#x27;, &#x27;houses&#x27; (the final -b is an indefinite suffix)
* the shortening of the final syllable of the singular stem (or Ablaut in this syllable): &#x27;camel&#x27;, &#x27;camels&#x27;
* shift of the accent from the ultimate to the penultimate syllable: &#x27;lion&#x27;, &#x27;lions&#x27; (orthographically identical)
* a combination of these.
A small number of nouns do not distinguish between singular and plural forms. Some nouns are always plural. A few nouns have suppletive plurals.

====Case and definiteness====
A noun may be prefixed by a clitic definite article, or have an indefinite suffix. Definite articles indicate gender, number, and case. The indefinite suffix marks gender only, and does not appear in the nominative case. For feminine common nouns, the indefinite suffix is ; for masculine nouns and feminine proper nouns, . The indefinite suffixes only appear after vowels. The definite article is proclitic. It has the following forms with masculine monosyllabic nouns that do not begin with or (note that an initial glottal stop is usually omitted in writing, and that all words that appear to be vowel-initial actually begin with a glottal stop):

The feminine definite articles begin with but are otherwise identical (, , , ). With nouns longer than one syllable and with nouns that begin with or , reduced forms of the definite article are used which do not distinguish between cases, but maintain gender distinctions. In some dialects (e.g. that described by Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa for Port Sudan) the reduced forms maintain number distinctions; in others (e.g. that described by Vanhove and Roper for Sinkat) they do not.

====Possession====
Possessive relationships are shown through a genitive suffix (singular possessed) or (plural possessed) which attaches to the possessing noun. If the possessing noun is feminine, the genitive marker will begin with ; if the possessed is feminine, the suffix will end with . When the suffix does not end with the feminine marker , it reduces to , whether singular or plural (that is, the singular/plural distinction is only marked for feminine possessa). Because this suffix adds a syllable to the noun, full forms of articles cannot be used; thus, the article on the noun itself does not indicate case. However, agreeing adjectives will be marked for oblique case. No article or indefinite suffix may be applied to the possessed noun. The possessed noun follows the possessor. Examples:

* &#x27;the man&#x27;s friend (m)&#x27;
* &#x27;the man&#x27;s friend (f)&#x27;
* &#x27;the woman&#x27;s friend (m)&#x27;
* &#x27;the woman&#x27;s friend (f)&#x27;
* &#x27;the men&#x27;s friends (f)&#x27;
(The noun &#x27;man&#x27; has the suppletive plural &#x27;men&#x27;; &#x27;friend&#x27; has the shortened plural &#x27;friends&#x27;.)

Postpositions follow nouns in the genitive. Examples:

* &#x27;The man came toward the chief/elder.&#x27; (: &#x27;toward&#x27;)
* &#x27;The boy is with the girls.&#x27; (: &#x27;with&#x27;)

====Adjectives====
Adjectives follow the nominal heads of noun phrases. They agree in gender, number, case, and definiteness, and carry case and definiteness markers of the same form as nouns.

===Copula===
Clauses may be composed of two noun phrases or a noun phrase and a predicative adjective followed by a copular clitic. The copula agrees in person, gender, and number with the copula complement (the second term), but the first- and third-person forms are identical. The copular subject will be in the nominative case, the copular complement in the oblique. Oblique becomes before . Copular complements that end in a vowel will employ an epenthetic between the final vowel and any vowel-initial copular clitic.

Examples:

* &quot;I am strong.&quot;
* &quot;You are strong.&quot;
* &quot;He is a lion.&quot;
* &quot;This is a five-piastre piece.&quot;
* &quot;We are Amirab.&quot;
* &quot;They are the donkeys.&quot;
* &quot;They are the thieves.&quot;

===Verbs===
Beja verbs have two different types, first noted by Almkvist: &quot;strong verbs,&quot; which conjugate with both prefixes and suffixes and have several principal parts; and &quot;weak verbs,&quot; which conjugate with suffixes only and which have a fixed root. Verbs conjugate for a number of tense, aspect, modality, and polarity variations, which have been given different names by different linguists:

(Roper analyzes additional subjunctive forms where Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa, and Vanhove see a conditional particle.)

Each of the above forms has a corresponding negative. (Vanhove refers to the imperative negative as the &quot;prohibitive&quot;.) The past continuous and past share a past negative. Negative forms are not derived from corresponding positive forms, but are independent conjugations.

Every verb has a corresponding deverbal noun, which Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa refer to as a &quot;noun of action&quot;, Vanhove calls an &quot;action noun&quot;, and Roper a &quot;nomen actionis&quot;. Numerous serial verb constructions exist which connote different aspectual and potential meanings.

====Imperative====
The third person masculine singular positive imperative is the citation form of the verb. Weak verbs have a long final suffix while strong verbs have a short final suffix . For both weak and strong verbs, the negative imperative is formed by an identical set of prefixes (for masculine singular and common plural) and (for feminine singular). Strong verbs use a negative imperative root which has a lengthened vowel.



====Deverbal and dependent forms====
=====Deverbal noun=====
Every Beja verb has a corresponding deverbal noun (Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa: &quot;noun of action&quot;; Vanhove: &quot;action noun&quot;; Roper: &quot;nomen actionis&quot;). For weak verbs, the deverbal noun is formed by a suffix attached to the imperative root (see above). For strong verbs, deverbal nouns are not entirely predictable.

Examples:
* Weak verbs: &quot;to sleep&quot; → &quot;sleeping&quot;; &quot;to forgive&quot; → &quot;forgiving&quot;
* Strong verbs: &quot;to hobble&quot; → &quot;hobbling&quot;; &quot;to be pregnant&quot; → &quot;being pregnant&quot;

There are patterns in strong verb deverbal nouns related to the structure of the citation form of the verb. However, these are not consistent.

=====Deverbal adjective=====
A further derived form is a suffix attached to the citation root, and then followed by for masculine nouns and for feminine. Examples:

This form may be used as an adjective, but it is also employed in the construction of multiple conjugated negative forms. Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa analyse this form as a participle. Martine Vanhove analyses it as a manner converb .

====Tense-conjugated forms====
=====Past continuous/aorist=====
The past continuous stem for strong verbs is not derivable from any other verb stem. The negative of the past continuous is identical to that of the past: There is only one past tense negative form. For both weak and strong verbs, the past negative is formed through a deverbal participial or converbal form (see above) followed by the present negative of the irregular verb &quot;to be&quot;.

Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa describe the past continuous as being used for &quot;habitual, repeated actions of the (more distant) past.&quot; It is the verb conjugation used for counterfactual conditionals, which leads to Roper&#x27;s identifying this tense as the &quot;conditional&quot;. It is also frequently used in narratives.



=====Past/perfective=====
The past or perfective stem for strong verbs is identical to the citation form (imperative) stem, with predictable phonetic modifications. The negative is identical to that of the past continuous/aorist (above).



=====Present/imperfective=====
The present or imperfective has two stems for positive strong verbs, while the negative strong stem is identical to that used for the imperative (and thus also for past/perfective verbs). Weak negative verbs add the prefix to positive past/perfective forms.



=====Future=====
The strong future stem is described differently by Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa and by Vanhove. Both agree that it is a fixed stem followed by a present/imperfective conjugated form of the verb &quot;to say.&quot; Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa&#x27;s strong stem is similar to the past continuous/aorist stem (next section), and identical for all numbers, genders, and persons, except the first person plural, which has a prefixed . For Vanhove, there are distinct singular and plural stems which are identical to the past continuous/aorist first person singular and plural, respectively. Similarly, for weak verbs, Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa have a future stem ending in with a first person plural , followed by a present tense/imperfective conjugation of . Vanhove sees the as a singular future, and the as a general plural. For negative verbs, the negative present/imperfective of is used as the conjugated auxiliary.



(NB: Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa see verbs of the form CiCiC as having identical past continuous [aorist] and future stems. Some verbs of other forms have different stems, which would lead to a greater divergence between the forms described by them and those described by Vanhove.) E.M. Roper, describing the same dialect as Vanhove, identifies the stem employed as being identical to the past continuous/aorist (for him, &quot;conditional&quot;—see above), just as Vanhove does. However, he understands the form with as being used only with the first person plural, as Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa do.

======Intentional/desiderative======
In addition to the future, Bidhaawyeet has a similar form expressing desire to undertake an act or intention to do so. The citation root takes a suffix for all persons, genders, and numbers, and is followed by a present tense/imperfective conjugated form of the verb &quot;to say&quot;, as the future is.

====Jussive, optative, potential====
There is distinct disagreement between the major grammars of the past century on the modal conjugation or conjugations referred to as &quot;jussive,&quot; &quot;optative,&quot; and &quot;potential.&quot;

Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa describe a &quot;jussive&quot; with the following paradigm. For strong verbs, the first person is based on the past/perfective stem, and the persons are based on the future stem; no negative jussive is given:



They give various examples of the jussive with translations into English, in order to give a sense of the meaning:
* &quot;Let me ask!&quot;
* &quot;What would you (m) like to drink?&quot;
* &quot;Please let us look for it!&quot; (Atmaan dialect)

Vanhove identifies a complex &quot;potential&quot; form composed of a nominalizing suffix followed by a present/imperfective reduced conjugation of the verb &#x27;come&#x27; ( in the non-reduced present/imperfective).



Vanhove describes the potential as expressing &quot;epistemic modalities of inference or near-certainty.&quot; Examples below, with the potential verbs in bold:
* I am really exhausted, so I should rest a while,&#x27; he says.&quot;

Additionally, she recognizes an optative with positive and negative polarity. The positive optative is formed from a prefix to the past continuous/aorist. The negative construction is more complex. In some dialects, the final of most forms of the weak negative is a short :



Vanhove gives no explanation for the use of the optative positive. The optative negative is used in conditional clauses with meanings of incapacity and necessity:
* Don&#x27;t let it come from behind me!&#x27; I told myself.&quot;
* &quot;The donkey stopped in a place where nothing can arrive.&quot;
* &quot;I thought he would not be able to run.&quot;
* &quot;Oh, man, hit the leopard! I don&#x27;t need to shout at you and…&quot;

==Lexicon==
Through lexicostatistical analysis, David Cohen (1988) observed that Beja shared a basic vocabulary of around 20% with the East Cushitic Afar and Somali languages and the Central Cushitic Agaw languages, which are among its most geographically near Afroasiatic languages. This was analogous to the percentage of common lexical terms that was calculated for certain other Cushitic languages, such as Afar and Oromo. Václav Blažek (1997) conducted a more comprehensive glottochronological examination of languages and data. He identified a markedly close ratio of 40% cognates between Beja and Proto-East Cushitic as well as a cognate percentage of approximately 20% between Beja and Central Cushitic, similar to that found by Cohen.

A fairly large portion of Beja vocabulary is borrowed from Arabic. In Eritrea and Sudan, some terms are instead Tigre loanwords. Andrzej Zaborski has noted close parallels between Beja and Egyptian vocabulary.

The only independent Beja dictionary yet printed is Leo Reinisch&#x27;s 1895 &quot;Wörterbuch der Beḍauye-Sprache&quot;. An extensive vocabulary forms an appendix to E.M. Roper&#x27;s 1928 &quot;Tu Beḍawiɛ: An Elementary Handbook for the use of Sudan Government Officials&quot;, and this has formed the basis for much recent comparative Cushitic work. Klaus and Charlotte Wedekind and Abuzeinab Musa&#x27;s 2007 &quot;A Learner&#x27;s Grammar of Beja (East Sudan)&quot; comes with a CD which contains a roughly 7,000-word lexicon, composed mostly of one-word glosses. Klaus Wedekind, Abuzeinab Muhammed, Feki Mahamed, and Mohamed Talib were working on a Beja-Arabic-English dictionary, but publication appears to have been stalled by Wedekind&#x27;s death. Martine Vanhove announced a forthcoming Beja-Arabic-English-French dictionary in 2006. It has not yet been published. The Beja scholar Muhammed Adarob Ohaj produced a Beja-Arabic dictionary as his masters thesis in 1972. It has not yet been published.

===Swadesh List===
The following list is drawn from Wedekind, Wedekind, and Musa&#x27;s 2007 grammar and Roper&#x27;s 1928 handbook. Nouns are given in indefinite accusative forms (the citation form); unless marked otherwise, forms that end in are feminine and all others are masculine. Verbs are given in the singular masculine imperative.

#Beja handles negation through distinct negative polarity conjugation. There is no lexical &quot;not.&quot;
# In some dialects means &quot;pupil.&quot;
# refers to the foot and leg.
# This is a rare suppletive imperative. Other forms of the verb have no and are constructed around a consonantal root .
# covers the blue-green range.

===Numbers===

&quot;Ten&quot; has combining forms for the production of teens and products of ten. Numbers from 11 to 19 are formed by followed by the units. E.g., &quot;fourteen&quot; is . Combining ones use the form ; e.g., &quot;eleven&quot; is . &quot;Twenty&quot; is . &quot;Twenty-one&quot; is . &quot;Thirty&quot; is ; &quot;forty&quot; is ; &quot;fifty&quot; is ; etc. &quot;One hundred&quot; is . For higher numbers, Beja-speakers use Arabic terms.

Ordinal numbers are formed by the addition of a suffix . &quot;First&quot; is , borrowed from Arabic.

&quot;Half&quot; is . Other fractions are borrowed from Arabic.

==Literature==
Beja has an extensive oral tradition, including multiple poetic genres. A well-known epic is the story of the hero Mhamuud Oofaash, portions of which have appeared in various publications by Klaus Wedekind. An edition appears in Mahmud Mohammed Ahmed&#x27;s &quot;Oomraay&quot;, published in Asmara. In the 1960s and &#x27;70s, the Beja intellectual Muhammed Adarob Ohaj collected oral recordings of poetic and narrative material which are in the University of Khartoum Institute of African and Asian Studies Sound Archives. Didier Morin and Mohamed-Tahir Hamid Ahmed have used these, in addition to their own collections, for multiple academic publications in French on Beja poetics. Red Sea University and the NGO Uhaashoon worked with oral story-tellers to produce a collection of 41 short readers and a longer collection of three short stories in Beja between 2010 and 2013.

<text>The Pascagoula (also Pascoboula, Pacha-Ogoula, Pascagola, Pascaboula, Paskaguna) were an indigenous group living in coastal Mississippi on the Pascagoula River.

The name &quot;Pascagoula&quot; is a Choctaw term meaning &quot;bread eater&quot;. Choctaw native Americans using the name Pascagoula are named after the words for &quot;bread eaters&quot;.
==History==

Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville encountered the tribe in 1699 and was impressed by the beauty of Pascagoula women.
According to local Euro-American legend, the peace-loving tribe walked single file into the river because the local Biloxi tribe were planning to attack. Anola, a Biloxi &quot;princess&quot;, eloped with the Pascagoula chief Altama, although she was engaged to a Biloxi chieftain. Anola&#x27;s angry would-be husband led his soldiers into battle with the Pascagoula. Outnumbered and fearing enslavement by the Biloxi, the tribe joined hands and walked into the river singing a death song. The river became known as the &quot;Singing River&quot; because of this death song, which reportedly can still be heard at night.

==Language==

John Sibley reported that they spoke their own language which was different from neighboring languages in addition to Mobilian Jargon. Their language is undocumented.

<doc id="534206" wikidata="Q407967" url="?curid=534206" title="Airai">
<text>Airai, located on the southern coast of Babeldaob island, is the second-most populous state of Palau. It contains the country&#x27;s chief airport, Roman Tmetuchl International Airport, and is connected by the Koror–Babeldaob Bridge to nearby Koror Island.
== Geography ==
The state has an area of 44 km2 (17 mi2), and a total population of 2,455 Census, the second largest in the country.

Airai, located in the southeast corner of Babeldaob, includes a large area in the interior, a thick fringe of mangroves, and several limestone rock islands extending out of the mangroves into the lagoon. At the southeast corner is the large and shallow Airai Bay. The interior and southeast part of the state is drained by the Ngerikiil River, with its tributaries including the Kmekumer and Chedeng. This drainage is one of the largest in Palau. The Ngerimel River, which supplies water for Airai and Koror from a reservoir, occupies a small drainage on the west side of Rois Tungd in the south central part of the state. The drainages along the east and west coast are generally short and steep. A line of low hills parallels the coast. Inland from these hills are rolling hills which rise to the Rael Kedam, the central ridge system on Babeldaob. The Rael Kedam begins at Ngetkib village and extends north through Rois Tungd and Rois Ngesibang to the boundary with Aimeliik. From here, the Rael Kedam extends north through Rois Ngetechum to the corner of Aimeliik, Ngatpang and Airai, and then extends on to Rois Ormuul and the boundary with Ngchesar. From here, the northern boundary of Airai extends southeast across Rois Beng to the east coast. The inland hills are predominantly covered by forest, while much of the coastal ridge is covered by savanna and short, scrubby vegetation.

The modern villages of Airai include Ngetkib, Ngeruluobel, Ngerusar, Yelch, Airai, and Oikull. In addition, several homes and farms are located along the coastal road in the Ocholochol area and between Ngerusar and Yelch in Ngersung and Ngerullak. Yelch is a modern settlement surrounding the Airai Elementary School and Airai Community Center buildings. With the exception of Koror, Airai is the most densely populated state in Palau. Most of the population is located on the low, natural bench along the coast. The soil here is rich and supports a variety of vegetation and other resources.

Several different kinds of land use in Airai include private gardens, commercial gardens, commercial business, and municipal enterprises. Commercial business range in size from small stores to the large scale quarry operation near Ngeruluobel. Private gardens surround residences and villages, and interspersed with these are stands of agroforest which include coconut, betelnut, breadfruit, almond trees, and banana plants . Also, located along drainages are taro swamp gardens. According to informants, except for occasional forays to hunt pigeon or harvest special plants, there is little active use of most of the interior of Airai.

Airai is most notable for its &quot;bai&quot; (men&#x27;s meeting house), the oldest one in existence, dating back 200 years. The turbulent rains of Palau did not treat ancient Palauan architecture kindly. Airai is more inland/mountainous-jungle and therefore more of a bedroom community of Koror.

==Demography==
The population of the state was 2,455 in the 2015 census and median age was 33 years. Airai is also the name of the biggest town in the state, with a population of 920 people . The town of Airai is the largest town in Palau outside of the state of Koror. The official languages of the state are Palauan and English. Ngiraked is the title of the traditional high chief from the state.

In June 1972, the resident population was 693.

==Political system==
Airai has its own constitution, adopted in 1990. The state government was established in 1981. The state of Airai has an elected chief executive, governor. The state also has a legislature elected every four years. The state population elects one of the members in the House of Delegates of Palau.

== Villages ==

There are at least eleven traditional village sites in Airai: Ngetkib, Ngeruluobel, Ngerkedam, Ngerusar, Ngersung, Ngerullak, Ngerdiull, Airai, Oikull, Ngchesechang, and Ngerchemel. Ngerchemel is a village north of Ngetkib on the west side of Rois Tungd . It was destroyed by plantation operation during the Japanese era. These settlements were focused on the rich soil and mixed forest on a narrow strip of land along the coast and around Airai Bay. Within villages are numerous stone features with historical and traditional importance. Many of the stone platforms, odesongel, serve as clan cemeteries, and other stone features serve as shrines. The lagoon and Airai Bay are important resource areas, and were probably intensively exploited prehistorically. Important resources include mangrove and many fish species. In and around the traditional villages are areas of taro gardens and garden plots, and terraced hill sides are frequently found around village sites.

== Transport ==
Airai is connected to Koror by the Koror Babeldaob Bridge which crosses the Toach el Mid (channel) from Ngetkib to Ngermereues north of Ngerbodel. At the base of the hill on the Airai side of the bridge, the main road turns east and continues along the coastal bench to Airai Village. A second road extends north along the coast through the Ocholochol area following the route of a Japanese era road. The main road winds through the modern villages of Ngetkib, Ngeruluobel, Ngerusar, Yelch, and finally Airai, its terminus. At Ngerusar, the road branches north into the interior past the airport and the reservoir. This was the main road to Aimeliik until the coastal road opened in the mid 1980s. Just north of the airport, a side branch of this road extends east past the Palau Mission Academy, across the Ngerikiil River, and across rolling hills north of Airai Bay to Oikull. The airport, with its 7700-foot runway, is Palau&#x27;s main link to the outside world. The airport was started during the Japanese administration, apparently near the end of the 1930s, and has been expanded considerably during the American administration.

== Education==
The Ministry of Education operates public schools.

Airai Elementary School opened circa September 1945. It initially used the former Japanese Communications building.

Palau High School in Koror is the country&#x27;s only public high school, so children from this community go there.

<doc id="534225" wikidata="Q5183905" url="?curid=534225" title="Creemore">
<text>Creemore () is a former village, now part of Clearview Township, located in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada. It lies approximately north of Toronto, 40 minutes west of Barrie, and 20 minutes south of Collingwood and Georgian Bay. It sits on the eastern boundary of the Niagara Escarpment. 

Creemore purportedly has North America&#x27;s smallest jail. Coboconk and Tweed make similar claims of their jails.

==History==

French explorer Samuel de Champlain first visited the Creemore area in 1616 to promote trade with the Petun, a First Nations tribe. He was the first to write a description of the area: “The country is full of hill-slopes and little level stretches, which make it a pleasant country.’

Before explorers arrived in the early 17th century, indigenous people lived in the general area of Creemore. Some of these native tribes included: Petun, Wyandot (Wendat), Iroquois, and Algonquin. Soon, early white explorers arrived to trade with these native tribes. Along with the arrival of the explorers, English civilization was soon imported into the area that we now know as Creemore. The settlement of Creemore began in 1842, and by the turn of the century it was a thriving village of about 800 people with a vibrant business community.

Creemore&#x27;s name and town origins have strong Irish roots – the name is derived from the Irish “cron mor,” which means “big heart” and it was the village&#x27;s founder, Irish entrepreneur Edward Webster who coined the name in the year 1845. He paid tribute to his family by naming the original streets after them: Elizabeth (for his wife and daughter), Francis and Wellington (for his sons), and Alice and William (for his parents).

In 1993, the amalgamation of Sunnidale, Nottawasaga, Village of Creemore and the Town of Stayner took place and it became Clearview Township.

==Economy==

Creemore has a vibrant small business community and is the home to Creemore Springs Brewery. The microbrewery was acquired by Molson on April 22, 2005.
Each year the Copper Kettle festival attracts thousands, closing the entire main street with activities and antique automobile displays, bands, Farm animals and many other attractions for young and old.

<text>Creemore Springs is a brewery in Creemore, Ontario, Canada, which first opened in 1987. It was founded by John Wiggins, and its flagship brew was a premium amber lager brewed with specialty malts, fire brewed in a copper kettle. In 2005, it was acquired by Molson, a subsidiary of the seventh largest (at the time) brewery corporation in the world, Molson Coors Brewing Company.

The brewery is known for not using preservatives during the brew process or pasteurizing afterwards. Because of this, it recommends perpetual refrigeration. The brewery states that it uses only four ingredients in its brewing process: malted barley, hops, water, and yeast. These are the four ingredients allowed to be in beer according to the Bavarian Purity Law, which all Creemore Springs beers follow. The brewery uses water exclusively from an artesian well in its brewing process. The water comes from the Creemore Spring located on one of the founder&#x27;s property. It is trucked from the source to the brewery daily in 10,000 L truckloads; each truckload contains enough water to brew one batch. The beer is brewed in small batches.

Its flagship premium lager is an American amber with affinities to a Czech pilsener.

It was the second Ontario brewer – after Hockley Valley – to offer its product for sale in cans.

In March 2016, Creemore Springs opened Batch, a 2,500-square-foot &#x27;gastrobrewery&#x27; (serving beer and food); this location is making six small-batch beers on site.

In 2009, Creemore Springs applied for planning permission to expand its plant by 60% to triple its brewing capacity to 150,000 hL per year. The location of such a large industrial plant in downtown Creemore generated debate. Subsequently, the company loss its status as a member of the Ontario Craft Brewers Association. Considering that aspect, and the ownership by a multi-national, the expansion into Quebec (marketing but not brewing in that province, since 2013), as well as the volume of beer produced, Creemore Springs may no longer be categorized as a craft brewery.

In 2019, Creemore Springs introduced a new logo and package design, its first major branding change since the brewery was founded. The change was controversial, and even received criticism from John Wiggins, the brewery&#x27;s founder.

<text>eFSH is a follicle-stimulating hormone obtained from equine species, used to stimulate fertility.

== Clinical studies ==
The effects of eFSH on mares is observed by creating a treatment group that received 12.5 milligrams of eFSA injections twice a day when the follicle of the mare was 25 mm in diameter then received human chorionic gonadotropin(hCG) at 35 mm follicle diameter while a control group only receives hCG at 35 mm follicle diameter.

=== Embryo transfer ===
The application of utilizing eFSH to increase the efficiency of equine embryo transfer was tested at the University of Saskatchewan. Embryos from 12 donor mares at 8 days of ovulation were recovered, scored, then transferred to 37 recipients mares who were tested for pregnancy after 7-10 days. 5 pregnancies resulted from the 15 embryos were recovered from the eFSA treatment group and 4 pregnancies occurred from the 6 embryos collected from the control. The usage of eFSA in the study had a correlation with a lower score.

=== Equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) production ===
The study conducted by the Department of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Kentucky has found that eFSH injections increase the probability superovulation occurring in mares and that carried twin result in a greater eCG concentration than one. Weekly blood samples were examined for eCG levels and the mares were compared gestation, twin pregnancy, and test grouping. 9 of the 10 mares in the eFSH group carried twin pregnancies and 1 of the 9 mares in the control groups carried twins. The mares carrying twins averaged around twice the eCG concentration of a regular pregnancy.

=== Effects of progesterone and estradiol ===
The aim of this experiment was to determine whether administration of progesterone and estradiol for 10 days eFSH would enhance the response to eFSH administration. The experiment was carried out with two groups. Group 1 was the control and group were injected with progesterone and estradiol. From this experiment it was concluded that there is no benefit to treating mare with progesterone and estradiol before eFSH treatment.

<text>This is a list of hybrid vehicles. A hybrid could theoretically have any two power sources, but hybrid vehicles have typically combined an internal combustion engine with a battery and electric motor(s).

This list includes both regular hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, in chronological order of first production. Since Porsche made the first hybrid car in 1899 there have been a number of hybrid vehicles; but there was a marked increase in interest in, and development of, hybrid vehicles for personal transport in the late 1990s.

==Automobiles==
===Overview by decade===
===Early designs: 1899–1917===
* 1899: Carmaker Pieper of Belgium introduced a vehicle with an under-seat electric motor and a gasoline engine. It used the internal combustion engine to charge its batteries at cruise speed and used both motors to accelerate or climb a hill. Auto-Mixte, also of Belgium, built vehicles from 1906 to 1912 under the Pieper patents.
* 1900: Ferdinand Porsche, then a young engineer at Jacob Lohner &amp; Co. creates the first gasoline–electric hybrid vehicles.
* 1901: Jacob Lohner &amp; Co. produces the first Lohner–Porsche, a series of gasoline–electric hybrid vehicles based on employee Ferdinand Porsche&#x27;s novel drivetrain. These vehicles had a driveline that was either gas or electric, but not both at the same time.
* 1905 or sooner: Fischer Motor Vehicle Co., Hoboken, NJ produces and sells a petrol–electric omnibus in the United States and in London, including battery storage.
* 1907: AL (French car)
* 1917: Woods Dual Power Car had a driveline similar to the current GMC/Chevrolet Silverado hybrid pickup truck.

==Buses==

<text>Egungun, Yoruba language: Egúngún, also known as Ará Ọ̀run (The collective dead) in the broadest sense is any Yoruba masquerade or masked, costumed figure. More specifically, it is a Yoruba masquerade for ancestor reverence, or the ancestors themselves as a collective force. &quot;Eégún&quot; is the reduced form (abbreviation through syllable elision) of the word &quot;egúngún&quot; and has the same meaning. There is a misconception that Eegun/Egun (Yoruba language: Eégún) is the singular form, or that it represents the ancestors while Egúngún is the masquerade or the plural form. This misconception is common in the Americas by Orisa devotees that do not speak Yorùbá language as a vernacular. Egungun is a visible manifestation of the spirits of departed ancestors who periodically revisit the human community for remembrance, celebration, and blessings.
==Classification of Egungun types==
The classification of Egun or Egungun types, might appear to be a fairly straightforward task, but in fact it is extremely complex deciphering the comprehension of indigenous taxonomies.
The difficulties include: the problem of distinguishing between personal Egun names and generic terms for types; the problem of determining &quot;sets&quot; where one masquerade may be regarded as several type of categories simultaneously; the practice of &quot;layering,&quot; in which a masquerade wears one costume type over another and changes these during performance; and the variety of criteria used to classify Egungun as well as the range of variations within type of categories. Such factors demonstrate the complexity of the analysis of indigenous taxonomies and the classification of masquerade types. These same difficulties arise in the definition and use of the term Egungun itself. However, from cultural affinities, especially in the Yoruba land, Southwest, Nigeria, the following egungun names can be identified: Danafojura and Awodagbese in Ogbomoso, Alapansanpa in Ibadan, and Feleru in Ibobu, Osun State.

== Role of the family ==
In the Yoruba religion, the annual ceremonies in honor of the dead serve as a means of assuring their ancestors a place among the living. They believe the ancestors have the responsibility to compel the living to uphold the ethical standards of the past generations of their clan, town or family. The Egungun are celebrated in festivals, known as Odun Egungun, and in family ritual through the masquerade custom.

In family situations, a family elder known either formally or informally as &quot;Alagba&quot; presides over ancestral rites. He may or may not be initiated into the local Egungun society. In matters that deal with whole communities, Egungun priests and initiates who are trained in ancestral communication, ancestral elevation and funerary rites are assigned to invoke and bring out the ancestors. They wear elaborate costumes as masquerades. Through drumming and dance, the Egungun robed performers are believed to become possessed by the spirits of the ancestors, as manifested as a single entity. The Egungun spiritually cleans the community; through the dramatic acting and miming of the robed priests, they demonstrate both ethical and amoral behavior that have occurred since their last visit. In this way, they expose the strengths and weaknesses of the community to encourage behavior more befitting of their descendants. When this performance is completed, the performers as Egungun give messages, warnings and blessings to the assembled spectators.

Important Egungun include the Oloolu and Alapansanpa, both of Ibadanland. Elewe of the Ìgbómìnà Yoruba clan, which is common in the towns of Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún, Ìlá Òràngún, and Arandun, is also of particular prominence.

In Brazil, the main cult of the Egungun is found on the island of Itaparica, in the State of Bahia. Houses of worship dedicated to the Egungun also exist in other states.

==Egungun ensembles==

Cloth plays an important role in the world of the Yoruba. Their beliefs equate nakedness with infancy, insanity, or the lack of social responsibility. More elaborate dress reflects social power and prestige. In performances honoring ancestors, exquisite cloth is the major medium for the masker&#x27;s transformation. An Egungun costume is composed of multiple layers of cloth lappets made from expensive and prestigious textiles, expressing the wealth and status of a family as well as the power of the ancestor.

The composition of an Egungun ensemble has several distinctive features. The layer worn closest to the masker&#x27;s skin, the under sack, must be made of Aso-Oke, the indigo and white strip-cloth (Fig. 6). It closely resembles the shroud in which the dead are wrapped. This sack, along with the netting for the face and hands, must completely seal the masker&#x27;s body. The netting effectively disguises facial and hand features that might disclose his identity.

On top of this base are placed the layers of lappets. As the masker whirls, the lappets are sent flying, creating a &quot;breeze of blessing.&quot; The design of the costume is therefore closely related to the choreography of the performance. Henry Drewal hypothesizes that the breeze of blessing created by the Egungun may also relate to Oya, the wife of Shango, the deified fourth king of Oyo and the god of thunder. Oya is the whirlwind, considered a wind of blessing, that precedes Shango, the storm.

To make the costume beautiful, and thus powerful, the lappets are decorated with patchwork patterns, braids, sequins, tassels, and amulets. The amulets hold medicinal preparations which have performative power (ase), providing protection against enemies at a time when the transformed person is vulnerable. The main protective amulets, however, are on the inside of the costume, not the outside. Metallic objects are also sewn onto the garment. These catch the light as the wearer moves, creating flashes that suggest connection to the spirit world, orun.

The multiple hidden and visible layers of fabric used to create an Egungun costume signify the sacred and the worldly, respectively. The layers, used in combination, suggest the reunion of the departed and the living.

An ensemble is repaired and refurbished for use year after year, with layers of new lappets and amulets added to express remembrance and honour. Through divination, however, an ancestor might request a new costume altogether. The owner and the patron, the priest of divination, the tailor, the herbalist who prepares the packets of medicines, and the entire lineage collaborate in creating the ensemble. Depending upon its wealth, a family may own several types of Egungun costumes, which may represent specific or collective ancestors of the lineage.

The Egungun ensemble acts as the medium for the masker&#x27;s transformation into his ancestors. An Egungun society is composed of men and women whose lineages have the right to present the masquerade. Men do the masking. Women never wear the costume, although they participate in the chorus that sings the oriki praise poems and histories of the families. Elder women of high title also perform invocations, prayers, and offerings. At annual festivals, each of the numerous lineages is given a separate day to perform. The masker is kept at a distance from the surrounding crowd with the help of attendants dressed in masquerade costumes of different types. After all the Egungun have danced, the ensembles are stored until the next performance.

==Festival==
Egungun Festival is a festival that is celebrated amongst the Yoruba people, which is celebrated annually and has been passed successively down to generations. &quot;The ensuing festival goes on for several days and strengthens the bonds that unite families and communities with departed ancestors.&quot; It is believed to help develop trade and commerce and generally bond the people of Yorubaland together regardless of their religious beliefs. Members of the society dance to marketplaces, wearing their masks to represent the deceased spirits of their ancestors, the spirit to be worshipped is solely decided by Ifa Oracle.

== Women&#x27;s role in Egungun ==
Egungun masquerades are male-dominated within the performance aspect and only men are allowed to connect with the spirits in Egungun by transforming into the masked figure. Women are prevalent in creating the materials, dramatizing the performance, singing, dancing and watching. Elders say that separation is necessary because of the dangers of women&#x27;s power.

According to the Ifa corpus, women were once in control of Egungun. The ritual originates from women&#x27;s religious experience in Yoruba. It is also argued that women were the sustainers of Egungun and according to the &quot;Odu Irantegbe&quot; &quot;chapter&quot; of the Ifa corpus, they were tricked by men and their powers over the Egungun cult were taken away.

<text>Dos mujeres, un camino (English title: &quot;Two women, one path&quot;) is a Mexican neo-noir telenovela produced by Emilio Larrosa for Televisa in 1993–1994. This production was exhibited in 47 countries, including Indonesia, had high viewer ratings, and has been described as one of Televisa&#x27;s most successful telenovelas.

Erik Estrada, Laura León and Bibi Gaytán starred as protagonists, while Enrique Rocha, Claudio Báez, Luz María Jerez, Elizabeth Dupeyrón, Lorena Herrera, Eduardo Liceaga and Rodrigo Vidal starred as antagonists. Tejano singer Selena appeared in two episodes.

==Plot==
The series tells the story of Juan Daniel, known as Johnny, a U.S.-born Mexican truck driver and family man who falls in love with a woman he meets in his travels, and of the complications as a consequence of his new love. &quot;Dos Mujeres...&quot; used the then-new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a backdrop to the story; Johnny transported merchandise from Mexico to the United States.

Johnny had enemies in Tijuana, where he was blamed for the death of Bernardo Montegarza (Eduardo Liceaga), son of the Montegarza family. Johnny is still very much in love with his wife (Laura León) when he falls for a young waitress, Tanya (Bibi Gaytán), whose mother owns a restaurant that Johnny frequents.

Tanya does not know he is married, and Raymundo, a police officer in love with Tanya, is working with fellow officer Ángel to pursue the head of the family that blames Johnny for the young man&#x27;s death. It is later discovered that Johnny did not cause Bernardo&#x27;s death (his own sister Alejandra, who was secretly in love with Johnny, had sabotaged a truck thinking that Johnny would use it), and while he was struggling to decide whether he wants to stay with his wife or his girlfriend, Tanya dies taking a knife thrust intended for her rival – Johnny&#x27;s wife – Ana Maria.

A side story involves Tanya&#x27;s friend Graciela being pursued by Bernardo&#x27;s younger brother Ricardo, and egged on by her mother, but preferring Ángel, who along with Raymundo are pursuing a drug trafficker known simply as Medusa, who turns out to be Bernardo, who was taken in by a drug cartel and changed his identity. Graciela becomes pregnant with Ricardo&#x27;s child, but she begins to like Ángel more as a potential husband. It is also revealed that Tanya&#x27;s real father was in fact Ismael Montegarza, patriarch of the Montegarza family and father of Bernardo, Alejandra and Ricardo; Ismael refuses to have anything to do with Bernardo after realizing what he had been doing, and decides to support Ricardo, the only son who was truly loyal to him.

Johnny and Ana Maria seem to reconcile after Tanya&#x27;s death. The final scene shows the couple retiring for the evening; Johnny, however, in the middle of the night, has a nightmare about Tanya&#x27;s death, and calls her name in his sleep. When he awakes in the morning, Ana Maria and the children are gone, but in a letter, she promises that he will see the children, but not her.

<text>The New York Shipbuilding Corporation (or New York Ship for short) was an American shipbuilding company that operated from 1899 to 1968, ultimately completing more than 500 vessels for the U.S. Navy, the United States Merchant Marine, the United States Coast Guard, and other maritime concerns. At its peak during World War II, NYSB was the largest and most productive shipyard in the world. Its best-known vessels include the destroyer , the cruiser , the aircraft carrier , the nuclear-powered cargo ship , and a quartet of cargo-passenger liners nicknamed the &quot;4 Aces&quot;.

==History==
It was founded in 1899 by Henry G. Morse (1850–2 June 1903), an engineer noted in connection with bridge design and construction and senior partner of Morse Bridge Company. The original plan was to build a shipyard on Staten Island, thus the name of the company, but plans to acquire a site there failed. The company then explored other potential sites as far south as Virginia, particularly in the Delaware River area, and ultimately chose a location in the southern part of Camden, New Jersey. Site selection considered the needs of the planned application of bridge-building practices of prefabrication and assembly-line production of ships in covered ways. Construction of the plant began in July 1899; the keel of the first ship was laid in November 1900. That ship, contract number 1, was &quot;M. S. Dollar&quot;, which was later modified as an oil tanker and renamed &quot;J. M. Guffey&quot;. Two of the first contracts were for passenger ships that were among the largest then being built in the United States: #5 for and #6 for . Morse died after securing contracts for 20 ships. He was followed as president by De Coursey May.

On November 27, 1916, a special meeting of the company&#x27;s stockholders ratified sale of the &quot;fifteen million dollar plant&quot; to a group of companies composed of American International Corporation, International Mercantile Marine Co., W. R. Grace and Company and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. From about 1933 to 1937 the shipyard was part of Errett Lobban Cord&#x27;s business empire.

New York Ship&#x27;s unusual covered ways produced everything from aircraft carriers, battleships, and luxury liners to barges and car floats.
 

During World War I, New York Ship expanded rapidly to fill orders from the U.S. Navy and the Emergency Fleet Corporation. A critical shortage of worker housing led to the construction of Yorkship Village, a planned community of 1,000 brick homes designed by Electus Darwin Litchfield and financed by the War Department. Yorkship Village is now the Fairview section of the City of Camden.

New York Ship&#x27;s World War II production included all nine light carriers (CVL), built on light cruiser hulls; the 40,000-ton battleship ; all three of the six 30,000-ton Alaska-class cruisers that were built (, , and ), four 15,000-ton Baltimore-class heavy cruisers, and 98 LCTs (Landing Craft, Tank), many of which took part in the D-Day landings at Normandy.

After World War II, a much-diminished New York Ship subsisted on a trickle of contracts from the United States Maritime Administration and the U.S. Navy. In 1959, the yard launched the NS &quot;Savannah&quot;, the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered merchant ship. The yard launched its last civilian vessel () in 1960, and its last naval vessel, , was ordered in 1967. The company&#x27;s final completed submarine was , which had been ordered in the early 1960s, but construction was halted from 1963 to 1965 because of the loss of the . &quot;Guardfish&quot; was commissioned in December 1967.

In 1968, lacking new naval orders, NYS ceased operations. , then under construction, was towed to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi, for completion.

The yard&#x27;s site is now part of the Port of Camden. The caisson previously used in NYS’s graving dock is still in use today in the former Philadelphia Navy Yard’s dry dock number 3.

<doc id="534313" wikidata="Q125749307" url="?curid=534313" title="Long-tailed weasel">
<text>The long-tailed weasel (Neogale frenata), also known as the bridled weasel, masked ermine, or big stoat, is a species of weasel found in North, Central, and South America. It is distinct from the short-tailed weasel (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;), also known as a &quot;stoat&quot;, a close relation in the genus &quot;Mustela&quot; that originated in Eurasia and crossed into North America some half million years ago; the two species are visually similar, especially the black tail tip. 

Long-tailed weasels exhibit scale-dependent patterns of habitat selection, favoring forest patches, fencerows, and drainage ditches while avoiding agricultural fields, suggesting sensitivity to habitat fragmentation due to agricultural practices. 

== Taxonomy ==
The long-tailed weasel was originally described in the genus &quot;Mustela&quot; with the name &quot;Mustela frenata&quot; by Hinrich Lichtenstein in 1831. In 1993, the classification, &quot;Mustela frenata&quot;, was accepted into the second edition of the &quot;Mammal species of the world: a taxonomic and geographic reference&quot;, which was published by the &quot;Smithsonian Institution Press&quot;. The species, with classification and name &quot;Mustela frenata&quot;, was accepted into the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Later, in a study published in 2021 in the &quot;Journal of Animal Diversity&quot;, Bruce Patterson &quot;et al.&quot; reclassified the long-tailed weasel into the genus &quot;Neogale&quot; along with two other former &quot;Mustela&quot; species, as well as the two species formerly classified in &quot;Neovison&quot;.

==Evolution==

The long-tailed weasel is the product of a process begun 5–7 million years ago, when northern forests were replaced by open grassland, thus prompting an explosive evolution of small, burrowing rodents. The long-tailed weasel&#x27;s ancestors were larger than the current form, and underwent a reduction in size to exploit the new food source. The long-tailed weasel arose in North America 2 million years ago, shortly before the stoat evolved as its mirror image in Eurasia. The species thrived during the Ice Age, as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow, as well as hunt in burrows. The long-tailed weasel and the stoat remained separated until half a million years ago, when falling sea levels exposed the Bering land bridge, thus allowing the stoat to cross into North America. However, unlike the latter species, the long-tailed weasel never crossed the land bridge, and did not spread into Eurasia.

==Description==
The long-tailed weasel is one of the larger weasels (comprising both &quot;Neogale&quot; and &quot;Mustela&quot;) in North America. There is substantial disagreement both on the upper end of their size and difference in size by sex by source: one indicates a body length of and a tail comprising 40–70% of the head and body length. It adds that in most populations, females are 10–15% smaller than males, thus making them about the same size as large male stoats, according to a second source. A third states they range from 11 to 22 inches (280–560 mm) in length, with the tail measuring an additional 3 to 6 inches (80–150 mm). It maintains the long-tailed weasel weighs between 3 and 9 ounces (85-267 g) with males being about twice as large as the females.

The eyes are black in daylight, but glow bright emerald green when caught in a spotlight at night. The dorsal fur is brown in summer, while the underparts are whitish and tinged with yellowish or buffy brown from the chin to the inguinal region. The tail has a distinct black tip. Long-tailed weasels in Florida and the southwestern US may have facial markings of a white or yellowish colour. In northern areas in winter, the long-tailed weasel&#x27;s fur becomes white, sometimes with yellow tints, but the tail retains its black tip. The long-tailed weasel moults twice annually, once in autumn (October to mid-November) and once in spring (March–April). Each moult takes about 3–4 weeks and is governed by day length and mediated by the pituitary gland. Unlike the stoat, whose soles are thickly furred all year, the long-tailed weasel&#x27;s soles are naked in summer. The long-tailed weasel has well-developed anal scent glands, which produce a strong and musky odour. Analysis of a dichloromethane extract of the anal gland secretion showed it contained 2,2-dimethylthietane, 2,4-dimethylthietane, 2,3-dimethylthietane, 2-propylthietane, 3,3-dimethyl-1,2-dithiolane, 3-ethyl-1,2-dithiolane, indole and 2-aminoacetophenone. Unlike skunks, which spray their musk, the long-tailed weasel drags and rubs its body over surfaces in order to leave the scent, to mark their territory and, when startled or threatened, to discourage predators.

==Identification==

===Tracks and scat===
The footprint of a long-tailed weasel is about 1 inch (25 mm) long. Although they have five toes, only four of them can be seen in their tracks. The only exception to this is when walking in the snow or mud, all five of their toes are shown. Their footprints will also appear heavier if the weasel is carrying food. Another way to determine the presence of a weasel is by looking for wavy indents made by their tails in the snow.

The long-tailed weasel uses one spot to leave their feces. This spot is usually near where they burrow. They&#x27;ll continuously use this spot for their droppings until it gets covered by environmental changes.

===Distinguishing features===
A black-tipped tail, yellowish-white belly fur, and brown fur on its back and sides are distinguishing for the long-tailed weasel. Additionally, the long-tailed weasel has long whiskers, a long narrow body, and a long tail that is approximately half the length of the body and head of the weasel. Compared to the short-tailed weasel the long-tailed weasel lacks a white line on the insides of its legs.

==Behaviour==

===Reproduction and development===
The long-tailed weasel mates in July–August, with implantation of the fertilized egg on the uterine wall being delayed until about March. The gestation period lasts 10 months, with actual embryonic development taking place only during the last four weeks of this period, an adaptation to timing births for spring, when small mammals are abundant. Litter size generally consists of 5–8 kits, which are born in April–May. The kits are born partially naked, blind and weighing , about the same weight of a hummingbird. The long-tailed weasel&#x27;s growth rate is rapid, as by the age of three weeks, the kits are well furred, can crawl outside the nest and eat meat. At this time, the kits weigh . At five weeks of age, the kit&#x27;s eyes open, and the young become physically active and vocal. Weaning begins at this stage, with the kits emerging from the nest and accompanying the mother in hunting trips a week later. The kits are fully grown by autumn, at which time the family disbands. The females are able to breed at 3–4 months of age, while males become sexually mature at 15–18 months.

===Denning and sheltering behaviour===
The long-tailed weasel dens in ground burrows, under stumps or beneath rock piles. It usually does not dig its own burrows, but commonly uses abandoned chipmunk holes. The diameter nest chamber is situated around from the burrow entrance, and is lined with straw and the fur of prey.

===Defense===
The enemies of the long-tailed weasel are usually coyotes, foxes, wildcats, wolves, and the Canadian lynx. The weasel will give off its musky odor, however, this is not primarily used when encountering other creatures. When leaving an area they were just in, they will leave their odor behind. This is done by the weasels taking themselves and hauling their bodies across surfaces they just interacted with. The long-tailed weasel does this to &quot;discourage predators&quot; from coming back to the area, possibly indicating that the weasel considers this a safe haven for return. This type of reaction is also reserved for when the weasel feels it is in danger, or when it is looking for a mate. Tree-climbing is another type of defense mechanism that long-tailed weasels utilize against predators on the ground. These weasels will climb up a reasonable height of a tree when they sense that they are in danger. They will then sit silent and &quot;motionless&quot;, while looking at their presumed predator. These weasels keep their guard up like this until the predator leaves, and when the weasel considers itself no longer in danger.

Another common defense of long-tailed weasels is its black-tipped tail, which differs in color from the rest of the body. When the long-tailed weasel becomes more white in the winter, this defense mechanism is especially used. The black-tipped tail distracts predators from the rest of the body, as it is more visible to the eye of a predator. This causes the visibility of the actual weasel to be rather difficult and makes the predator attack the tail instead of the weasel. The weasel is allowed to escape the predator because of this.

===Diet===
The long-tailed weasel is a fearless and aggressive hunter which may attack animals far larger than itself. When stalking, it waves its head from side to side in order to pick up the scent of its prey. It hunts small prey, such as mice, by rushing at them and killing them with one bite to the head. With large prey, such as rabbits, the long-tailed weasel strikes quickly, taking its prey off guard. It grabs the nearest part of the animal and climbs upon its body, maintaining its hold with its feet. The long-tailed weasel then manoeuvres itself to inflict a lethal bite to the neck.

The long-tailed weasel is an obligate carnivore which prefers its prey to be fresh or alive, eating only the carrion stored within its burrows. Rodents are almost exclusively taken when they are available. Its primary prey consists of mice, rats, squirrels, chipmunks, shrews, moles and rabbits. Occasionally, it may eat small birds, bird eggs, reptiles, amphibians, fish, earthworms and some insects. The species has also been observed to take bats from nursery colonies. It occasionally surplus kills, usually in spring when the kits are being fed, and again in autumn. Some of the surplus kills may be cached, but are usually left uneaten. Kits in captivity eat from a quarter to half of their body weight in 24 hours, while adults eat only one fifth to one third. After killing its prey, the long-tailed weasel laps up the blood, but does not suck it, as is popularly believed. With small prey, also the fur, feathers, flesh and bones are consumed, but only some flesh is eaten from large prey. When stealing eggs, the long-tailed weasel removes each egg from its nest one at a time, then carries it in its mouth to a safe location where it bites off the top and licks out the contents or if they have babies in the den they may hold it in their mouth all the way back to them.

==Subspecies==
, 42 subspecies are recognised.

== Cultural meanings ==
In North America, Native Americans (in the region of Chatham County, North Carolina) deemed the long-tailed weasel to be a bad sign; crossing its path meant a &quot;speedy death&quot;.

<text>Daniel Jacob Stern (born August 28, 1957) is an American actor, artist, director, comedian, and screenwriter. He is best known for his roles as Marv Murchins in &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990) and &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992), Phil Berquist in &quot;City Slickers&quot; (1991) and &quot;City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1994), the voice of adult Kevin Arnold on the television series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, and the voice of Dilbert on the animated series of the same name. Other notable films of his include &quot;Breaking Away&quot; (1979), &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; (1980), &quot;Diner&quot; (1982), &quot;Blue Thunder&quot; (1983), &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), &quot;The Milagro Beanfield War&quot; (1988), &quot;Coupe de Ville&quot; (1990), and &quot;Very Bad Things&quot; (1998). He made his feature-film directorial debut with &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; (1993).

==Early life==
Stern was born in Bethesda, Maryland to Cynthia and Leonard Stern. His father was a social worker while his mother managed a day care center. He is Jewish. His brother is television writer David M. Stern. During his years at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, Stern starred in several theater productions, including playing Chuck Baxter in &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; and Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. Stern applied for a job as a lighting engineer for a Shakespeare Festival in Washington, D.C., but was hired as a walk-on in their production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, starring Glenn Close. He dropped out of high school in his senior year and soon moved to New York. After taking acting lessons at HB Studio with Austin Pendleton and Herbert Berghof, Stern began his acting career in Off Broadway and Broadway productions, including &quot;True West&quot; with Gary Sinise and &quot;How I Got That Story&quot; at Second Stage Theatre with Bob Gunton. He acted in numerous productions at The Public Theater, Ensemble Studio Theater, Cherry Lane Theater, and Manhattan Theater Club.

==Career==

In 1979, Stern made his film debut as Cyril in &quot;Breaking Away&quot;. The following year he played a student who raised objections during Jill Clayburgh&#x27;s proof of the snake lemma in the film &quot;It&#x27;s My Turn&quot;. He was the novice observer Richard Lymangood in the 1983 action thriller film &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;. He had another early film role in the 1984 horror film &quot;C.H.U.D.&quot;, as the soup kitchen C.H.U.D. hunter. His breakthrough role as Laurence &quot;Shrevie&quot; Schreiber came in Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Diner&quot;. He appeared in two films with Woody Allen, &quot;Stardust Memories&quot; and &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;.
Stern has played characters in a number of comedic roles, such as Phil Berquist in &quot;City Slickers&quot; and &quot;City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly&#x27;s Gold&quot;, and Marv the burglar in the first two &quot;Home Alone&quot; films, &quot;Home Alone&quot; and &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;, with Joe Pesci. However, he declined to play the character once again in the fourth installment of the franchise, believing the script to be a disgrace to the original motion picture. He also starred as Max in &quot;Bushwhacked&quot;. He provided the voice of the narrator on the TV series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, which starred Fred Savage as Kevin Arnold. As narrator, Stern played the adult Kevin Arnold, remembering his youth. Stern and Savage were also featured together in &quot;Little Monsters&quot;, in which Stern played the father of Savage&#x27;s character. In 1998, Stern took on a more serious role in the black comedy &quot;Very Bad Things&quot; with Christian Slater, Cameron Diaz and Jon Favreau. Stern provided the voice for the main character of the &quot;Dilbert&quot; animated TV series, based on the comic strip by Scott Adams.

Stern directed several episodes of &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; and the 1993 feature film &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot;, and in recent years directed two episodes of the TV series, &quot;Manhattan&quot;.

Stern created, wrote, and starred in the CBS television show &quot;Danny&quot;.

He wrote the off-Broadway hit &quot;Barbra&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, which was produced by The Dodgers and Manhattan Theater Club. It starred John Pankow and Julie White and ran for six months. Stern also appeared in the play at Garry Marshall&#x27;s Falcon Theater.

Stern was originally offered the role of Dale Gribble in &quot;King of the Hill&quot; but he was replaced by Johnny Hardwick when his salary agreement went low. He starred in &quot;Game Over, Man!&quot; (2018) as well as the Hulu original series, “Shrill”, as the main character’s (Aidy Bryant) father.

==Personal life==
Stern works as an artist, specializing in bronze sculpture. He has created sculptures for California public art projects in San Diego, Pasadena, Palm Desert, Temple City, Monrovia, and Agoura Hills. He is an artist in residence at Studio Channel Islands Art Centre in Camarillo. He has also done many private commissions, gallery exhibitions and art fairs. He married actress Laure Mattos in 1980, and together they have three children, one of whom is California State Senator Henry Stern.

<text>Barack Hussein Obama II (born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who was the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American president. Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.

Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. In 1996, Obama was elected to represent the 13th district in the Illinois Senate, a position he held until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In the 2008 presidential election, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama selected Joe Biden as his running mate and defeated Republican nominee John McCain.

Obama was awarded the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize for efforts in international diplomacy, a decision which drew both criticism and praise. During his first term, his administration responded to the 2007–2008 financial crisis with measures including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a major stimulus package to guide the economy in recovering from the Great Recession; a partial extension of the Bush tax cuts; legislation to reform health care; and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, a major financial regulation reform bill. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He oversaw the end of the Iraq War; and ordered Operation Neptune Spear, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the September 11 attacks. Obama downplayed Bush&#x27;s counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces, while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. He also ordered the 2011 military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.

Obama defeated Republican opponent Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. In his second term, Obama advocated for gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, took steps to combat climate change, signing the Paris Agreement, a major international climate agreement, and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term. He initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL following the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, negotiated the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (a nuclear agreement with Iran), and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan decreased during Obama&#x27;s second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout the remainder of his presidency. Obama promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to publicly support same-sex marriage.

Obama left office in 2017 with high approval ratings both within the United States and among foreign advisories. He continues to reside in Washington D.C. and remains politically active, campaigning for candidates in various American elections, including in Biden&#x27;s successful presidential bid in the 2020 presidential election. Outside of politics, Obama has published three books: &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot; (1995)&quot;, The Audacity of Hope&quot; (2006), and &quot;A Promised Land&quot; (2020). His presidential library began construction in the South Side of Chicago in 2021. Historians and political scientists rank Obama among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents.

==Early life and career==


Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states. He was born to an 18-year-old American mother and a 27-year-old Kenyan father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas, and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the U.S. in 1850. In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century. Obama&#x27;s father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–1982), was a married Luo Kenyan from Nyang&#x27;oma Kogelo. His last name, Obama, was derived from his Luo descent. Obama&#x27;s parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship. The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.

In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack&#x27;s father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned a Master of Arts in economics. Obama&#x27;s parents divorced in March 1964. Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the senior economic analyst in the Ministry of Finance. He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971, before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old. Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: &quot;That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.&quot; He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.

In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965. After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet district of South Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng district of Central Jakarta.

===Education===
At the age of six, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he was registered in school as &quot;Barry&quot; and attended local Indonesian-language schools: &quot;Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi&quot; (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and &quot;Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01&quot; (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of his four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama&#x27;s stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him &quot;a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works&quot;.

In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School—a private college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In high school, Obama continued to use the nickname &quot;Barry&quot; which he kept until making a visit to Kenya in 1980. Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo Soetoro in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.

Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: &quot;The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.&quot; Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to &quot;push questions of who I was out of my mind&quot;. Obama was also a member of the &quot;Choom Gang&quot; (the slang term for smoking marijuana), a self-named group of friends who spent time together and smoked marijuana.

 College and research jobs 

After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation&#x27;s policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA. After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.

 Community organizer and Harvard Law School 

Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project, a faith-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988. He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants&#x27; rights organization in Altgeld Gardens. Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute. In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.
Despite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts. He was selected as an editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; at the end of his first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard. During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins &amp; Sutter in 1990. Obama&#x27;s election as the first black president of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot;. Obama graduated from Harvard Law in 1991 with a Juris Doctor &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

 University of Chicago Law School 

In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book. He then taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.

From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois&#x27;s Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading &quot;Crain&#x27;s Chicago Business&quot; to name Obama to its 1993 list of &quot;40 under Forty&quot; powers to be.

===Family and personal life===
In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: &quot;It&#x27;s like a little mini-United Nations,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;ve got relatives who look like Bernie Mac, and I&#x27;ve got relatives who look like Margaret Thatcher.&quot; Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father&#x27;s family, six of them living. Obama&#x27;s mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham, until her death on November 2, 2008, two days before his election to the presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011. In &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot;, Obama ties his mother&#x27;s family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, among others.

Obama lived with anthropologist Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s. He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down. The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.
In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed at Sidley Austin. Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama&#x27;s adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date. They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children. The couple&#x27;s first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998, followed by a second daughter, Natasha (&quot;Sasha&quot;), in 2001. The Obama daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School. The Obamas had two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy. In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female. Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.

Obama is a supporter of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator. In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president. In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school&#x27;s varsity team, and he is left-handed.

In 2005, the Obama family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6million house (equivalent to $million in ) in neighboring Kenwood, Chicago. The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko&#x27;s subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.

In December 2007, &quot;Money Magazine&quot; estimated Obama&#x27;s net worth at $1.3million (equivalent to $million in ). Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5million—up from about $4.2million in 2007 and $1.6million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books. On his 2010 income of $1.7million, he gave 14 percent to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans&#x27; families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments. Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10million.

===Religious views===
Obama is a Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life. He wrote in &quot;The Audacity of Hope&quot; that he &quot;was not raised in a religious household.&quot; He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet &quot;in many ways the most spiritually awakened person... I have ever known&quot;, and &quot;a lonely witness for secular humanism.&quot; He described his father as a &quot;confirmed atheist&quot; by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as &quot;a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.&quot; Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand &quot;the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.&quot;
In January 2008, Obama told &quot;Christianity Today&quot;: &quot;I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.&quot; On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views, saying:

Obama met Trinity United Church of Christ pastor Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992. During Obama&#x27;s first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after some of Wright&#x27;s statements were criticized. Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.

In 2016, Obama said that he gets inspiration from a few items that remind him &quot;of all the different people I&#x27;ve met along the way&quot;, adding: &quot;I carry these around all the time. I&#x27;m not that superstitious, so it&#x27;s not like I think I necessarily have to have them on me at all times.&quot; The items, &quot;a whole bowl full&quot;, include rosary beads given to him by Pope Francis, a figurine of the Hindu deity Hanuman, a Coptic cross from Ethiopia, a small Buddha statue given by a monk, and a metal poker chip that used to be the lucky charm of a motorcyclist in Iowa.

==Legal career==
From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the Woods Fund of Chicago—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the Joyce Foundation. He served on the board of directors of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999. Obama&#x27;s law license became inactive in 2007.

==Legislative career==
===Illinois Senate (1997–2004)===


Obama was elected to the Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic state senator Alice Palmer from Illinois&#x27;s 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn. Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican governor George Ryan&#x27;s payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.

He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002. In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.

In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate&#x27;s Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations. During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms. Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.

===2004 U.S. Senate campaign in Illinois===

In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.

Obama was an early opponent of the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s 2003 invasion of Iraq. On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the Iraq War, Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago anti-Iraq War rally, and spoke out against the war. He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd &quot;it&#x27;s not too late&quot; to stop the war.

Decisions by Republican incumbent Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor Carol Moseley Braun not to participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot;. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.

Obama&#x27;s expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004. Six weeks later, Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan. In the November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70 percent of the vote, the largest margin of victory for a Senate candidate in Illinois history. He took 92 of the state&#x27;s 102 counties, including several where Democrats traditionally do not do well.

===U.S. Senate (2005–2008)===

Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005, becoming the only Senate member of the Congressional Black Caucus. He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons; and the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending. On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators Tom Carper, Tom Coburn, and John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008. He also cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.

In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor. In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.

Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges. This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran&#x27;s oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.

Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for Foreign Relations, Environment and Public Works, and Veterans&#x27; Affairs through December 2006. In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. He also became Chairman of the Senate&#x27;s subcommittee on European Affairs. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa. He met with Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became President of the Palestinian National Authority and gave a speech at the University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government. Obama resigned his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.

==Presidential campaigns==
===2008===


On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois. The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic, as it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his &quot;House Divided&quot; speech in 1858. Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system.

Numerous candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process, but Obama gained a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules. 
On June 2, 2008, Obama had received enough votes to clinch his nomination. After an initial hesitation to concede, on June 7, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama. On August 23, 2008, Obama announced his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate. Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine. At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support. Obama delivered his acceptance speech at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium to a crowd of about eighty-four thousand; the speech was viewed by over three million people worldwide. During both the primary process and the general election, Obama&#x27;s campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations. On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.

John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected Sarah Palin as his running mate. Obama and McCain engaged in three presidential debates in September and October 2008. On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by McCain. Obama won 52.9 percent of the popular vote to McCain&#x27;s 45.7 percent. He became the first African-American to be elected president. Obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park. He is one of the three United States senators moved directly from the U.S. Senate to the White House, the others being Warren G. Harding and John F. Kennedy.

===2012===

On April 4, 2011, Obama filed election papers with the Federal Election Commission and then announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled &quot;It Begins with Us&quot; that he posted on his website. As the incumbent president, he ran virtually unopposed in the Democratic Party presidential primaries, and on April 3, 2012, Obama secured the 2778 convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination. At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.

On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president. With 51.1 percent of the popular vote, Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice. Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago&#x27;s McCormick Place after his reelection and said: &quot;Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.&quot;

==Presidency (2009–2017)==

===First 100 days===

The inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee. Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. He also revoked President George W. Bush&#x27;s restoration of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Mexico City policy which prohibited federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.

===Domestic policy===
The first bill signed into law by Obama was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits. Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program to cover an additional four million uninsured children. In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop &quot;strict guidelines&quot; on the research.

Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his presidency. He nominated Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009, to replace retiring associate justice David Souter. She was confirmed on August 6, 2009, becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of Hispanic descent. Obama nominated Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010, to replace retiring Associate Justice John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three for the first time in American history.

On March 11, 2009, Obama created the White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls. The council was chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett. Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States. The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett. The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994 Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden.

In July 2009, Obama launched the Priority Enforcement Program, an immigration enforcement program that had been pioneered by George W. Bush, and the Secure Communities fingerprinting and immigration status data-sharing program.

In a major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the Ares I rocket, Ares V rocket and Constellation program, in favor of funding earth science projects, a new rocket type, research and development for an eventual crewed mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the International Space Station.

On January 16, 2013, one month after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control. He urged Congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006. On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers. In a 2016 editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed &quot;common-sense gun reform&quot; to women&#x27;s suffrage and other civil rights movements in American history.

In 2011, Obama signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act. Following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic, but called for increased restrictions on the National Security Agency (NSA) to address violations of privacy. Obama continued and expanded surveillance programs set up by George W. Bush, while implementing some reforms. He supported legislation that would have limited the NSA&#x27;s ability to collect phone records in bulk under a single program and supported bringing more transparency to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).

====Racial issues====
In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.

Following Obama&#x27;s election, many pondered the existence of a &quot;post-racial America&quot;. However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent, and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as an intense racial animosity directed at Obama. The acquittal of George Zimmerman following the killing of Trayvon Martin sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he said that &quot;Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.&quot; The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri sparked a wave of protests. These and other events led to the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people. Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups.

Several incidents during Obama&#x27;s presidency generated disapproval from the African-American community and with law enforcement, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists, with mixed results. Some in law enforcement criticized Obama&#x27;s condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama&#x27;s expressions of empathy for the police. In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried &quot;a great deal&quot; about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001.

====LGBT rights====
On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim&#x27;s actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with HIV. The lifting of the ban was celebrated by Immigration Equality. On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign to end the don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces. In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military.

===== Same-sex marriage =====
As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama stated he favored legalizing same-sex marriage. During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages. In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating &quot;I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.&quot; On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so. During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013, Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word &quot;gay&quot; in an inaugural address. In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; (regarding same-sex marriage) and &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).

====Economic policy====
On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession. The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals. In March 2009, Obama&#x27;s Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to $2trillion in depreciated real estate assets.

Obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry in March 2009, renewing loans for General Motors (GM) and Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms&#x27; bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company. In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment. He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as &quot;Cash for Clunkers&quot;, which temporarily boosted the economy.

The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. These guarantees totaled about $11.5trillion, but only $3trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation&#x27;s debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.

The unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0 percent and averaging 10.0 percent in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7 percent in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6 percent in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year. Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8 percent, which was less than the average of 1.9 percent experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries. By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent, decreasing to 6.7 percent in the last month of 2013. During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3 percent in the first quarter. GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6 percent, followed by a 5.0 percent increase in the fourth quarter. Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year. In July 2010, the Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was &quot;unusually uncertain&quot;. Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9 percent in 2010.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama&#x27;s stimulus plan for economic growth. The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1million, while conceding that &quot;it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.&quot; Although an April 2010, survey of members of the National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73 percent of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of World War II. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the U.S. and the austerity measures in the European Union.

Within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes. The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858billion (equivalent to $ trillion in ) Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.

In December 2013, Obama declared that growing income inequality is a &quot;defining challenge of our time&quot; and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and Pope Francis&#x27; criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics. Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

====Environmental policy====

On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the Macondo Prospect in the Gulf of Mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government. Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the East Coast of the United States and along the coast of northern Alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.

In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he &quot;would reject the Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution [or] greenhouse emissions.&quot; On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline. It was the third veto of Obama&#x27;s presidency and his first major veto.

In December 2016, Obama permanently banned new offshore oil and gas drilling in most United States-owned waters in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act.

Obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the Antiquities Act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.

====Health care reform====
Obama called for Congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, cap premium increases, and allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.

On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009. After public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals. In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.

On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House. On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39. On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, colloquially &quot;Obamacare&quot;) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212. Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.

The ACA includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133 percentof the federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014, subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400 percentof the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum &quot;out-of-pocket&quot; payment for annual premiums will be from 2 percent to 9.5 percent of income, providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.

The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143billion over the first decade.

The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in &quot;National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius&quot; that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress&#x27;s taxing authority. In &quot;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby&quot; the Court ruled that &quot;closely-held&quot; for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in &quot;King v. Burwell&quot; that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans &quot;established by the State&quot;, as the statute reads.

===Foreign policy===

In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a &quot;new era&quot; in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms &quot;break&quot; and &quot;reset&quot; to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration. Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network, Al Arabiya. On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year&#x27;s video message to the people and government of Iran. On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at Cairo University in Egypt calling for &quot;A New Beginning&quot; in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace. On June 26, 2009, Obama condemned the Iranian government&#x27;s actions towards protesters following Iran&#x27;s 2009 presidential election.

In 2011, Obama ordered a drone strike in Yemen which targeted and killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American imam suspected of being a leading Al-Qaeda organizer. al-Awlaki became the first U.S. citizen to be targeted and killed by a U.S. drone strike. The Department of Justice released a memo justifying al-Awlaki&#x27;s death as a lawful act of war, while civil liberties advocates described it as a violation of al-Awlaki&#x27;s constitutional right to due process. The killing led to significant controversy. His teenage son and young daughter, also Americans, were later killed in separate US military actions, although they were not targeted specifically.
In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their military intervention in Yemen, establishing a &quot;Joint Planning Cell&quot; with Saudi Arabia. In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115billion. Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in Yemen&#x27;s capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.

In September 2016 Obama was snubbed by Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party as he descended from Air Force One to the tarmac of Hangzhou International Airport for the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit without the usual red carpet welcome.

====War in Iraq====
On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop&#x27;s levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces. On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over. On October 21, 2011, President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be &quot;home for the holidays.&quot;

In June 2014, following the capture of Mosul by ISIL, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing. In August 2014, during the Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIL. By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots. In early 2015, with the addition of the &quot;Panther Brigade&quot; of the 82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq increased to 4,400, and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.

====Afghanistan and Pakistan====
In his election campaign, Obama called the war in Iraq a &quot;dangerous distraction&quot; and that emphasis should instead be put on the war in Afghanistan, the region he cites as being most likely where an attack against the United States could be launched again. Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan. He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to &quot;stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan&quot;, an area he said had not received the &quot;strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.&quot; He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, with former Special Forces commander Lt. Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal&#x27;s Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war. On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date; this took place in July 2011. David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal&#x27;s staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article. In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014. In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.

Regarding neighboring Pakistan, Obama called its tribal border region the &quot;greatest threat&quot; to the security of Afghanistan and Americans, saying that he &quot;cannot tolerate a terrorist sanctuary.&quot; In the same speech, Obama claimed that the U.S. &quot;cannot succeed in Afghanistan or secure our homeland unless we change our Pakistan policy.&quot;

=====Death of Osama bin Laden=====

Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area from Islamabad. CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011. Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a &quot;surgical raid&quot; to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs. The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound. DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden&#x27;s corpse, which was buried at sea several hours later. Within minutes of the President&#x27;s announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City&#x27;s Ground Zero and Times Square. Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
====Relations with Cuba====

Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and Vatican City. The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. On December 10, 2013, Cuban President Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the Nelson Mandela memorial service in Johannesburg.

In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente. Popularly dubbed the Cuban Thaw, &quot;The New Republic&quot; deemed the Cuban Thaw to be &quot;Obama&#x27;s finest foreign policy achievement.&quot; On July 1, 2015, President Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and Havana. The countries&#x27; respective &quot;interests sections&quot; in one another&#x27;s capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively. Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to arrive since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.

====Israel====
During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the U.S.–Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries. The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the Iron Dome program in response to the waves of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem. In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so. Obama supports the two-state solution to the Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.

In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama&#x27;s view, &quot;with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.&quot; In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the civil rights movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples, explaining: &quot;To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I&#x27;ve been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.&quot; Obama expressed support for Israel&#x27;s right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;bad.&quot;

On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass. Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama administration&#x27;s actions, and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6million, on January 6, 2017. On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.

====Libya====
In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate. In response to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, the Foreign Minister of Libya Moussa Koussa announced a ceasefire. However Gaddafi&#x27;s forces continued to attack the rebels.

On March 19, a multinational coalition led by France and the United Kingdom with Italian and U.S. support, approved by Obama, took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government&#x27;s air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone, including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets. Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector. Some members of Congress questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath. In 2016 Obama said &quot;Our coalition could have and should have done more to fill a vacuum left behind&quot; and that it was &quot;a mess&quot;. He has stated that the lack of preparation surrounding the days following the government&#x27;s overthrow was the &quot;worst mistake&quot; of his presidency.

====Syrian civil war====
On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian civil war, Obama issued a written statement that said: &quot;The time has come for President Assad to step aside.&quot; This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015. In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels. The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.

In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the &quot;red line&quot; he had pledged and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued. In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL.

====Iran nuclear talks====

On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The &quot;Complex Modernization&quot; initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the &quot;Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action&quot; saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In addition, the transfer of $1.7billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the &quot;effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.&quot; In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration&#x27;s Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency.
On a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House.

====Russia====

In March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third. Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010. In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. In August 2013, he criticized Russia&#x27;s law that discriminates against gays, but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

After Russia&#x27;s invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had &quot;allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West&quot;, adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.

Obama&#x27;s family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who rose to prominence in the 1960s through their involvement in the civil rights movement. Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is &quot;black enough&quot;, Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that &quot;we&#x27;re still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.&quot; Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, remarking: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.&quot; Additionally, Obama has frequently been referred to as an exceptional orator. During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly video addresses on YouTube.

=== Job approval ===
According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating, the fifth highest for a president following their swearing in. His ratings remained above the majority level until November 2009 and by August 2010 his approval was in the low 40s, a trend similar to Ronald Reagan&#x27;s and Bill Clinton&#x27;s first years in office. Following the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011, Obama experienced a small poll bounce and steadily maintained 50–53 percent approval for about a month, until his approval numbers dropped back to the low 40s.

His approval rating fell to 38 percent on several occasions in late 2011 before recovering in mid-2012 with polls showing an average approval of 50 percent. After his second inauguration in 2013, Obama&#x27;s approval ratings remained stable around 52 percent before declining for the rest of the year and eventually bottoming out at 39 percent in December. In polling conducted before the 2014 midterm elections, Obama&#x27;s approval ratings were at their lowest with his disapproval rating reaching a high of 57 percent. His approval rating continued to lag throughout most of 2015 but began to reach the high 40s by the end of the year. According to Gallup, Obama&#x27;s approval rating reached 50 percent in March 2016, a level unseen since May 2013. In polling conducted January 16–19, 2017, Obama&#x27;s final approval rating was 59 percent, which placed him on par with George H. W. Bush and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose final Gallup ratings also measured in the high 50s.

Obama has maintained relatively positive public perceptions after his presidency. In Gallup&#x27;s retrospective approval polls of former presidents, Obama garnered a 63 percent approval rating in 2018 and again in 2023, ranking him the fourth most popular president since World War II.

===Foreign perceptions===
Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency. In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful. In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.

On October 9, 2009—only nine months into his first term—the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples&quot;, which drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures. He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office. He himself called it a &quot;call to action&quot; and remarked: &quot;I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations&quot;.

=== Thanks, Obama ===

In 2009, the saying &quot;thanks, Obama&quot; first appeared in a Twitter hashtag, &quot;#thanks Obama&quot;, and was later used in a demotivational poster. It was later adopted satirically to blame Obama for any socio-economic ills. Obama himself used the phrase in video in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, the phrase was used by Stephen Colbert to express gratitude to Obama on his last day in office. In 2022, President Joe Biden&#x27;s Twitter account posted the phrase.

==Post-presidency (2017–present)==
Obama&#x27;s presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon the inauguration of his successor, Donald Trump. The family moved to a house they rented in Kalorama, Washington, D.C. On March 2, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the Profile in Courage Award to Obama &quot;for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.&quot; His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics. On September 7, Obama partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities. From October 31 to November 1, Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation, which he intended to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.

Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018, to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for Netflix under the Obamas&#x27; newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions. Higher Ground&#x27;s first film, &quot;American Factory&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2020. On October 24, a pipe bomb addressed to Obama was intercepted by the Secret Service. It was one of several pipe-bombs that had been mailed out to Democratic lawmakers and officials. In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard from Wyc Grousbeck. On October 29, Obama criticized &quot;wokeness&quot; and call-out culture at the Obama Foundation&#x27;s annual summit.

Obama was reluctant to make an endorsement in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries because he wanted to position himself to unify the party, regardless of the nominee. On April 14, 2020, Obama endorsed Biden, the presumptive nominee, for president in the presidential election, stating that he has &quot;all the qualities we need in a president right now.&quot; In May, Obama criticized President Trump for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling his response to the crisis &quot;an absolute chaotic disaster&quot;, and stating that the consequences of the Trump presidency have been &quot;our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.&quot; On November 17, Obama&#x27;s presidential memoir, &quot;A Promised Land&quot;, was released.

In February 2021, Obama and musician Bruce Springsteen started a podcast called &quot;&quot; where the two talk about &quot;their backgrounds, music and their &#x27;enduring love of America. Later that year, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix, in a venture with his and Michelle&#x27;s Higher Ground to develop comedy projects.

On March 4, 2022, Obama won an Audio Publishers Association (APA) Award in the best narration by the author category for the narration of his memoir &quot;A Promised Land&quot;. On April 5, Obama visited the White House for the first time since leaving office, in an event celebrating the 12th annual anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act. In June, it was announced that the Obamas and their podcast production company, Higher Ground, signed a multi-year deal with Audible. In September, Obama visited the White House to unveil his and Michelle&#x27;s official White House portraits. Around the same time, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator for his narration in the Netflix documentary series &quot;Our Great National Parks&quot;.

In 2022, Obama opposed expanding the Supreme Court beyond the present nine Justices.

In March 2023, Obama traveled to Australia as a part of his speaking tour of the country. During the trip, Obama met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and visited Melbourne for the first time. Obama was reportedly paid more than $1 million for two speeches.

In October 2023, during the Israel–Hamas war, Obama declared that Israel must dismantle Hamas in the wake of the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. Weeks later, Obama warned Israel that its actions could &quot;harden Palestinian attitudes for generations&quot; and weaken international support for Israel; any military strategy that ignored the war&#x27;s human costs &quot;could ultimately backfire.&quot;

In July 2024, Obama expressed concerns about Biden&#x27;s campaign viability after his critically maligned debate performance against former president Trump. On July 21, Biden withdrew his candidacy and swiftly endorsed Vice President Harris right after to run as the Democratic nominee. Obama endorsed Harris alongside his wife Michelle five days later and delivered a speech at the 2024 Democratic National Convention formally endorsing her. He joined Harris on the campaign trail in October, traveling to various swing states and emphasizing her record as a prosecutor, Senator, and Vice President and advocating for increased voter turnout, and his criticisms of Donald Trump and the Republican Party were widely reported by various media outlets. After Trump was declared the winner of the election on November 6, Obama and Michelle congratulated him and Vice President-elect JD Vance while praising the Harris campaign and calling on liberal voters to continue supporting democracy and human rights.

==Legacy and recognition ==
Obama has been described as one of the most effective campaigners in American history (his 2008 campaign being particularly highlighted) as well as one of the most talented political orators of the 21st century. Historian Julian Zelizer credits Obama with &quot;a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals.&quot; Zeitzer notes Obama&#x27;s policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the Great Recession and the Dodd-Frank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the Affordable Care Act. Zeitzer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama&#x27;s term, saying that the consensus among historians is that Obama &quot;turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder.&quot; Zeitzer calls this the &quot;defining paradox of Obama&#x27;s presidency&quot;.

The Brookings Institution noted that Obama passed &quot;only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)—and a fragile one at that—the legacy of Obama&#x27;s presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions.&quot; David W. Wise noted that Obama fell short &quot;in areas many Progressives hold dear&quot;, including the continuation of drone strikes, not going after big banks during the Great Recession, and failing to strengthen his coalition before pushing for Obamacare. Wise called Obama&#x27;s legacy that of &quot;a disappointingly conventional president&quot;.

Obama&#x27;s most significant accomplishment is generally considered to be the Affordable Care Act (ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a &quot;skinny repeal&quot;, have thus far failed. However, in 2017, the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019. Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system&#x27;s most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.

Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his second term. In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

In 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States, and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.

As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights. In 2010, he signed the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGBT people; the law went into effect the following year. In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces. A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama&#x27;s term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama&#x27;s eight years in office.

Obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban. In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries. Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.

According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody since Democratic President Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) called Obama&#x27;s human rights record &quot;mixed&quot;, adding that &quot;he has often treated human rights as a secondary interest—nice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed.&quot;

Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating. He gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked him the 18th-greatest American president. In Gallup&#x27;s 2018 job approval poll for the past 10 U.S. presidents, he received a 63 percent approval rating.

Obama received the Norwegian Nobel Committee&#x27;s Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, The Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education&#x27;s Ambassador of Humanity Award in 2014, the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in 2017, and the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights Ripple of Hope Award in 2018. He was named &quot;TIME&quot; Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year in 2008 and 2012. He also received two Grammy Awards for Best Spoken Word Album for &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Audacity of Hope&quot; (2008) as well as two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Narrator for &quot;Our Great National Parks&quot; (2022), and &quot;&quot; (2023). He also won two Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Awards.

<doc id="534386" wikidata="Q1276360" url="?curid=534386" title="Polo Grounds">
<text>The Polo Grounds was the name of three stadiums in Upper Manhattan, New York City, used mainly for professional baseball and American football from 1880 to 1963. The original Polo Grounds, opened in 1876 and demolished in 1889, was built for the sport of polo. Bound on the south and north by 110th and 112th streets and on the east and west by Fifth and Sixth (Lenox) avenues, just north of Central Park, it was converted to a baseball stadium when leased by the New York Metropolitans in 1880.

The third Polo Grounds, built in 1890, and renovated after a fire in 1911, was in Coogan&#x27;s Hollow and was noted for its distinctive bathtub shape, with very short distances to the left and right field walls and an unusually deep center field.

The original Polo Grounds was home to the New York Metropolitans from 1880 to 1885, and the New York Giants from 1883 to 1888. The Giants played in the second Polo Grounds for part of the 1889 season and all of the 1890 season, and at the third Polo Grounds from 1891 to 1957. The Polo Grounds was also the home of the New York Yankees from 1913 to 1922 and New York Mets in their first two seasons (1962, 1963). Each version of the ballpark held at least one World Series. The final version also hosted the 1934 and 1942 All-Star Games.

In American football, the third Polo Grounds was home to the New York Brickley Giants for one game in 1921 and the New York Giants from 1925 to 1955. The New York Titans/Jets of the American Football League played at the stadium from the league&#x27;s inaugural season of 1960 until 1963.

Other sporting events held at the Polo Grounds included soccer, boxing, and Gaelic football. Its final sporting event was a pro football game between the Jets and Buffalo Bills. Shea Stadium opened in 1964 and replaced the Polo Grounds as the home of the Mets and Jets. The Polo Grounds was demolished and a public housing complex, Polo Grounds Towers, built on the site.

==Polo Grounds I==
The original Polo Grounds stood at 110th Street between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, directly across 110th Street from the northeast corner of Central Park. The venue&#x27;s original purpose was for the sport of polo. Its name was initially merely descriptive, not a formal name, often rendered as &quot;the polo grounds&quot; in newspapers. The Metropolitans, an independent team of roughly major-league caliber, was the first professional baseball team to play there, beginning in September 1880, and remained the sole professional occupant through the 1882 season. At that time the Metropolitans&#x27; ownership had the opportunity to bring it into the National League, but elected instead to organize a new team, the New York Gothams — who soon came to be known as the Giants — mainly using players from the Metropolitans and the newly defunct Troy Trojans, and entered it in the National League, while bringing what remained of the Metropolitan club into the competing American Association. For this purpose the ownership built a second diamond and grandstand at the park, dividing it into eastern and western fields for use by the Giants and Metropolitans respectively. Polo Grounds I thus hosted its first Major League Baseball games in 1883 as the home stadium of two teams, the American Association Metropolitans and the National League Gothams. The dual-fields arrangement proved unworkable because of faulty surfacing of the western field, and after various other arrangements were tried, the Metropolitans and Giants alternated play on the eastern field in later years until the Metropolitans moved to the St. George Cricket Grounds on Staten Island in 1886.

Although the Giants would soon become the team of choice in the city, the &quot;Mets&quot; had a good year in 1884. They had started the season in a new facility called Metropolitan Park, which proved to be such a poor venue that they moved back to the Polo Grounds within a few weeks. Despite that bit of drama, the Mets went on to win the American Association pennant. Their good fortune ran out when they faced the Providence Grays in the World Series, in which Providence pitcher Old Hoss Radbourn pitched three consecutive shutouts against them. All three games had been staged at the Polo Grounds.

An early highlight of Giants&#x27; play at the Polo Grounds was Roger Connor&#x27;s home run over the right-field wall and into 112th Street; Connor eventually held the record for career home runs that Babe Ruth would break July 8, 1921.

The original Polo Grounds was used not only for Polo and professional baseball, but often for college baseball and football as well – even by teams outside New York. The earliest known surviving image of the field is an engraving of a baseball game between Yale University and Princeton University on Decoration Day, May 30, 1882. Yale and Harvard also played their traditional Thanksgiving Day football game there on November 29, 1883 and November 24, 1887. (See Football below)

===Demolition and forced relocation===
New York City was in the process of extending its street grid into uptown Manhattan in 1889. Plans for an extended West 111th Street ran through the Polo Grounds. City workers are said to have shown up suddenly one day and begun cutting through the fence to lay out the new street. With the Giants having won the National League pennant the year before, as well as the World Series there was significant sentiment in the city against the move; a bill was even passed by the state legislature giving the Giants a variance which would allow the park to stand. Governor David B. Hill, who had campaigned for office on a &quot;home rule&quot; pledge, vetoed it on the grounds that whatever he might think of the forced destruction of the park, the will of the city government was to be respected. The loss of their park forced the Giants to look quickly for alternative grounds.

==Polo Grounds II==

The Giants opened the 1889 season at Oakland Park in Jersey City, New Jersey, playing their first two games there. Four days later, they moved to the St. George Cricket Grounds (where the Metropolitans had continued to play until their demise following the 1887 season).
After closing out a homestand at the St. George Grounds on June 14, the Giants went on the road. Upon their return on July 8 they had relocated again, to a &quot;New Polo Grounds&quot; site within Manhattan at the far terminus of the then Ninth Avenue Elevated at 155th Street and 8th Avenue (now Frederick Douglass Boulevard). Newspaper accounts indicate that the seats from the original Polo Grounds were moved to the new Polo Grounds stands. Despite their vagabond existence during the first half of the 1889 season, the Giants began their stay at the new ballpark just 4 games behind the league-leading Boston club. They rallied to win the pennant for the second consecutive year, as well as that year&#x27;s World Series against Brooklyn.

The new site was overlooked to the north and west by a steep promontory known as Coogan&#x27;s Bluff. Because of its elevation, fans frequently watched games from the Bluff without buying tickets. The ballpark itself was in bottomland known as Coogan&#x27;s Hollow. The grandstand had a conventional curve around the infield, but the shape of the property made the center field area actually closer than left center or right center. This was not much of an issue in the &quot;dead ball era&quot; of baseball. The land remained in the Coogan estate, and the Giants were renters for their entire time at Polo Grounds II, III and IV. The Brooklyn Dodgers played a pair of home series at this ballpark in late July and early August 1890.
After the National League version of the New York Giants moved into Polo Grounds III in 1891, Polo Grounds II was sub-leased to the Manhattan Athletic Club and was referred to ever after as Manhattan Field. It was converted for other sports such as football and track-and-field.

The New York Giants leased Manhattan Field to the Columbia University football team for $14,000 in 1899 and $15,000 in 1900.

The superstructure of Manhattan Field was demolished in 1911 following the fire that destroyed Polo Grounds III, but the site still existed as a field for 20 more years. Babe Ruth&#x27;s first home run as a Yankee, on May 1, 1920, was characterized by &quot;The New York Times&quot; reporter as a &quot;sockdolager&quot; (i.e. a decisive blow), and was described as traveling &quot;over the right field grand stand into Manhattan Field&quot;. Bill Jenkinson&#x27;s modern research indicates the ball traveled about in total, after clearing the Polo Grounds double decked right field stand. Manhattan Field continued to be an occasional site for amateur sports reported in local newspapers as late as spring of 1942. In June 1948, the Giants again leased the Manhattan Field property, and had it paved over to serve as a parking lot for the Polo Grounds.

==Polo Grounds III and IV==
===Polo Grounds III===

Polo Grounds III was the stadium that made the name nationally famous. Built in 1890, it initially had a completely open outfield bounded by just the outer fence, but bleachers were gradually added. By the early 1900s, some bleacher sections encroached on the field from the foul lines about halfway along left and right field. Additionally, there were a pair of &quot;cigar box&quot; bleachers on either side of the &quot;batter&#x27;s eye&quot; in center field. The expansive outfield was cut down somewhat by a rope fence behind which carriages (and early automobiles) were allowed to park. By 1910, bleachers enclosed the outfield, and the carriage ropes were gone. The hodge-podge approach to the bleacher construction formed a multi-faceted outfield area. There were a couple of gaps between some of the sections, and that would prove significant in 1911.

Known as Brotherhood Park when it opened in 1890, Polo Grounds III was the home of a second New York Giants franchise in the Players&#x27; League. The latter was a creation of Major League Baseball&#x27;s first union, the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players. After failing to win concessions from National League owners, the Brotherhood founded its own league in 1890. The Players&#x27; League Giants built Brotherhood Park in the northern half of Coogan&#x27;s Hollow, next door to Polo Grounds II, otherwise bounded by rail yards and the bluff. Brotherhood Park hosted its first game on April 19, 1890, the same day the National League&#x27;s Giants played their first home game of the season. For the full 1890 season the two editions of the Giants were neighbors. When the teams played on the same day, fans in the upper decks could watch each other&#x27;s games, and home run balls hit in one park might land on the other team&#x27;s playing field. After the one season the Players&#x27; League folded, and the Brotherhood&#x27;s members went back to the National League. The National League Giants then moved out of Polo Grounds II and into Brotherhood Park, which was larger. They took their stadium&#x27;s name with them once again, turning Brotherhood Park into the new-new Polo Grounds. Between Polo Grounds II and III-IV, they would remain in Coogan&#x27;s Hollow for 69 seasons.

===Fire and reconstruction as Polo Grounds IV===

In the very early morning hours of Friday, April 14, 1911, a fire of uncertain origin swept through the stadium&#x27;s horseshoe-shaped grandstand, consuming wood and leaving only steel uprights in place. The gaps between some sections of the stands saved a good portion of the outfield seating and the clubhouse from destruction. Giants owner John T. Brush decided to rebuild the Polo Grounds with concrete and steel, renting Hilltop Park from the Highlanders during reconstruction.

Progress was sufficient to allow the stadium to reopen just 2½ months later, June 28, 1911, the date some baseball guides date the structure. As configured, it was the ninth concrete-and-steel stadium in the Majors and fourth in the National League. Unfinished seating areas were rebuilt during the season while the games went on. The new structure stretched in roughly the same semicircle from the left field corner around home plate to the right field corner as prior but was extended into deep right-center field. The surviving wooden bleachers were retained basically as is, with gaps remaining on each side between the new fireproof construction.
The Giants rose from the ashes along with their ballpark, winning the National League pennant in 1911 (as they also would in 1912 and 1913). As evidenced from the World Series programs, the team renamed the new structure Brush Stadium in honor of their then-owner John T. Brush, but the name did not stick, and by the late 1910s it was passé. The remaining old bleachers were demolished during the 1923 season when the permanent double-deck was extended around most of the rest of the field and new bleachers and clubhouse were constructed across center field. This construction gave the stadium its familiar horseshoe or bathtub style shape, as well as a new nickname, &quot;The Bathtub&quot;.
This version of the ballpark had its share of quirks. The &quot;unofficial&quot; distances (never marked on the wall) down the left and right field lines were respectively, but there was a overhang in left field, which often intercepted fly balls that would otherwise have been catchable and turned them into home runs. Contrasting with the short distances down the foul lines were the 450-foot distances to deepest left and right center (the gaps); the base of the straightaway centerfield clubhouse stood 483 feet from home plate, up a 58-foot runway from the grandstand corners on either side of the clubhouse (these corners were themselves from home plate). The famous photo of The catch made by Willie Mays in the 1954 World Series against Vic Wertz of the Cleveland Indians occurred immediately in front of the &quot;batter&#x27;s eye&quot;, a metal screen atop the grandstand wall directly to the right of the centerfield runway. It would have been a home run in several other ballparks of the time as well as in most of today&#x27;s modern ballparks. The bullpens were actually in play, in the left and right center field gaps. The outfield sloped downward from the infield, and people in the dugouts often could only see the top half of the outfielders.

The New York Yankees sublet the Polo Grounds from the Giants during 1913–1922 after their lease on Hilltop Park expired. After the 1922 season, the Yankees built Yankee Stadium directly across the Harlem River from the Polo Grounds, which spurred the Giants to expand their park to reach a comparable seating capacity to stay competitive. Since nearly all the new seating was in the outfield, Yankee Stadium still had more desirable seats than did the Polo Grounds for watching baseball. However, the Polo Grounds became better suited for football due to the new seating placement.

The Giants&#x27; first night game at the stadium was played on May 24, 1940.

The Polo Grounds was the site of one of the most iconic moments in baseball history – the historic &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot; walk-off home run on October 3, 1951 that decided the hard-fought National League pennant playoff series between the Giants and their cross-town rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers.

===Deaths at the Polo Grounds===

On August 16, 1920, Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray Chapman was hit in the head by a pitch thrown by the Yankees&#x27; Carl Mays. At the time, batters did not wear helmets. Chapman died 12 hours after he was hit, at 4:30 a.m. on August 17. He remains the only player to die from an injury sustained in a Major League Baseball game.

On July 4, 1950, Bernard Doyle, a resident of Fairview, New Jersey, in his 50s, originally from Dublin, Ireland, was struck and killed by a stray bullet while in his seat at the Polo Grounds. Doyle had brought a neighbor&#x27;s son with him to see a doubleheader between the Dodgers and the Giants. Doyle was killed about an hour prior to the start of the first game. A 14-year-old boy later confessed to having shot a .45 caliber pistol into the air from his rooftop at 515 Edgecombe Avenue, located from where Doyle was seated.

===Giants&#x27; final years===
The Polo Grounds&#x27; end was somewhat anticlimactic, especially compared to other &quot;Jewel Box&quot; parks.

Part of the problem was that the stadium was not well maintained from the late 1940s onward: while the baseball Giants owned &quot;the stadium&quot;, the Coogan heirs still owned &quot;the parcel of land&quot; on which it stood, while the neighborhood around the stadium had begun to go to seed in the late 1940s. These, along with other factors, combined to restrict ticket sales, even when the Giants played well.

In 1954, for example, the baseball Giants only drew 1.1 million fans (compared to over two million for the Milwaukee Braves) despite winning the World Series.

The football Giants left for Yankee Stadium across the Harlem River following the 1955 NFL season, and the baseball Giants&#x27; disastrous 1956 season – most of which they spent in last place before a late-season surge moved them up to sixth – caused a further decline on ticket sales. The Giants&#x27; 1956 attendance was less than half of that for the Giants&#x27; World Series-winning 1954 season, and also ranked last in Major League Baseball.

Along with the departure of the football Giants and the consequental loss of their rent, this collapse of the baseball Giants&#x27; gate financially devastated franchise owner Horace Stoneham, who was not nearly as wealthy as his fellow owners – the Giants were his sole source of income. To make matters worse, Stoneham was left with no money for stadium upkeep, and he was forced to lay off the stadium&#x27;s maintenance staff in order to stay afloat.

The stadium also had very little parking; its final form had opened two years after the Model T was introduced. Due to the manner in which the stadium was designed, fans had to pour onto the field to exit via the center field gates, making for a problematic situation whenever attendance was anywhere near capacity.
Frustrated with the Polo Grounds being obsolete and dilapidated, and with no maintenance staff or prospect of the stadium being renovated, Stoneham seriously considered having the Giants become tenants of the Yankees in the Bronx, or moving to a proposed stadium that would have been owned by the city. 

After both of those plans fizzled, the Giants announced on August 19, 1957 that after 74 years of professional baseball in New York, they would relocate to San Francisco, California at the end of the season, following their long-time rivals Dodgers to the West Coast. The Giants had won five World Series titles in the Polo Grounds.

===The final years of the Polo Grounds===
The ballpark then sat largely vacant for nearly three years, until the newly formed Titans of New York (present-day New York Jets) began play in 1960, followed by the newly formed Mets in 1962, using the Polo Grounds as an interim home while Shea Stadium was being built. As a 1962 baseball magazine noted, &quot;The Mets will have to play in the Polo Grounds, hardly the last word in 20th Century stadia.&quot;

In 1961, the city of New York decided to claim the land under eminent domain, for the purpose of condemning the stadium and building a high-rise housing project on the site. The Coogan family, which still owned the property, fought this effort until it was finally settled in the city&#x27;s favor in 1967.

On September 18, 1963, 1,752 fans went to see the New York Mets play their last game at the Polo Grounds against the Philadelphia Phillies with a 5–1 Philadelphia win. The game&#x27;s highlights were later shown on Universal&#x27;s Universal International Newsreel. On October 12, the Polo Grounds played host to one last exhibition contest, as Latin American All-Stars of the National League, managed by Roberto Clemente and behind the pitching of Juan Marichal and Al McBean, defeated Hector Lopez&#x27;s AL Stars, 5–2.

The final sporting event played at the Polo Grounds was on December 14, 1963 when the now renamed AFL team New York Jets lost to the Buffalo Bills 19–10.

In the 1992 book &quot;The Gospel According to Casey&quot;, by Ira Berkow and Jim Kaplan, it is reported (p. 62) that in 1963, Mets manager Casey Stengel, who had bittersweet memories of his playing days at the Polo Grounds, had this to say during a rough outing to pitcher Tracy Stallard, whose greatest claim to fame had been giving up Roger Maris&#x27; 61st homer in 1961: &quot;At the end of this season, they&#x27;re gonna tear this joint down. The way you&#x27;re pitchin&#x27;, the right field section will be gone already!&quot;

===Demolition===
The final iteration of the Polo Grounds was demolished in 1964, beginning on April 10 with a wrecking ball bomb painted to look like a baseball, the same one that had been used four years earlier on Ebbets Field.

The wrecking crew wore Giants jerseys and tipped their hard hats to the historic stadium as they began dismantling it, with a crew of 60 workers taking 4½ months to level the stadium. Stephen McNair, a Dodger fan, grabbed a sledge hammer as easily as Johnny Mize picked up a bat, marked off the left field fence beneath Section 33, and vowed, &quot;I&#x27;m going to take that place down myself.&quot; It was the fence over which Bobby Thomson hit the home run that kept the Dodgers out of the World Series in 1951 and put the Giants in.

The foreman on the job, Abe Gach, shouted, &quot;No, you don&#x27;t. Be gentle over there. History was made there.&quot;

The Indians&#x27; bus passed the site in the midst of demolition while Cleveland was playing the Yankees: Dick Donovan, eyeing the rubble, remarked, &quot;Boy, they must have had a helluva game there last night.&quot;

The site is now home to the Polo Grounds Towers, a public housing project opened in 1968, and managed by the New York City Housing Authority.

==Sports other than baseball==

===Football===
The various incarnations of the Polo Grounds were well-suited for football, and hundreds of football games were played there over the years.

The first professional football game played in New York City was played at the Polo Grounds on December 4, 1920. The game featured the Buffalo All-Americans against the Canton Bulldogs in the first year of the American Professional Football Association. The Buffalo All-Americans won the game, 7–3. Some argue that the Buffalo All-Americans are tied with the Akron Pros for the first championship of the American Professional Football Association, which soon came to be known as the National Football League. In 1921 the NFL&#x27;s New York Brickley Giants played the final game of their 1921 season against the Cleveland Indians at the Polo Grounds. The game ended in a 17–0 Giants loss. Shortly afterwards, the team folded. The Brickley Giants were originally formed with the intent of competing in 1919, and having all of their home games held at the Polo Grounds. However, after the team&#x27;s first practice, the 1919 schedule, that began with an opening day game against the Massillon Tigers, was scratched because of conflict with New York&#x27;s blue laws. In 1919, the city allowed professional baseball on Sunday and the Giants thought the law would also apply to football. However, it was ruled that professional football was still outlawed on Sundays, so the team disbanded until 1921.

Other than the name, there is no relation between the Brickley Giants and the modern New York Giants franchise.

Both the New York Giants of the National Football League and the New York Jets (then known as the New York Titans) of the American Football League used the Polo Grounds as their home field before moving on to other sites. The Giants moved initially to Yankee Stadium in 1956 while the Jets, founded in 1960, followed the New York Mets to Shea Stadium in 1964.
The football Giants hosted the 1934, 1938, 1944, and 1946 NFL Championship Games at the Polo Grounds, while the 1936 NFL Championship Game, originally scheduled for Fenway Park, was moved to the Polo Grounds by mutual agreement of Boston Redskins franchise owner George Preston Marshall, the Green Bay Packers, and the NFL due to low ticket sales in Boston; the Redskins would relocate to Washington in 1937.

====College Football====

Columbia University and Yale University, two of American football&#x27;s oldest teams, played football in the original 110th Street Polo Grounds in the 19th century, for some games which were expected to draw large crowds, including the Thanksgiving contests in 1883 and 1887. (See also &quot;List of Harvard-Yale football games&quot;).

The grounds were also used for many games by New York-area college football teams such as Fordham and Army. An upset victory by the visiting University of Notre Dame over Army in 1924 led to Grantland Rice&#x27;s famous article about the Irish backfield, which he called &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;. The field was also the site of several Army–Navy Games in the 1910s and 1920s.

===Soccer===
The Polo Grounds held its fair share of international soccer matches as well over the years. In 1926, Hakoah, an all-Jewish side from Vienna, Austria, &quot;drew the largest crowds ever to watch soccer in America up to that time: three successive games drew 25,000, 30,000, and 36,000 spectators. The highlight of the tour was a May 1, 1926 exhibition game between Hakoah and an American Soccer League all-New York team which drew 46,000 fans to the Polo Grounds in New York.&quot; (The ASL team won 3–0.)

On 1927, Club Nacional de Football played 3 matches in his tour of North America. They played Flooring Indiana, Brooklyn Wanderers and an American League All-Star.

The first soccer played at the Polo Grounds was in 1894 when the owners of major baseball clubs formed the American League of Professional Football to fill their stadiums during baseball&#x27;s off-season. Six famous baseball franchises of the era formed Association Football sections and fans were told that many would be fielding their baseball stars on the football field in the opening season. The New York Giants soccer team took the field in all-white uniforms with black socks and played six games before the threat of a rival baseball league being formed diverted the owner&#x27;s attention away from their new venture and caused it to be suspended mid-season. The Giants lay third in the league after six games with two victories, having played their matches in midweek in front of attendances in the high hundreds paying 25 cents a game. Although the owners remained positive about the venture and wanted to run it again the following season this never happened and the Giants&#x27; soccer team was no more.

On May 19, 1935, the Scotland national team toured the United States, and in their first game played against an ASL All-Star squad which was unofficially representing the United States. Scotland won 5–1 in front of 25,000 people at the Polo Grounds. In 1939, the Scots returned to America for another tour, and played at the Polo Grounds twice. In their first game at the Polo Grounds on May 21, 1939, Scotland tied the Eastern USA All-Stars 1–1 in front of 25,072 fans. In their second game at the Polo Grounds on June 18, 1939, Scotland beat the American League Stars 4–2.

Following World War II, on September 26, 1948, the USA beat Israel 3–1 in their first ever game since independence before 25,000 fans at the Polo Grounds. On June 9, 1950, a crowd of 21,000 fans came to the Polo Grounds to watch an &#x27;International Dream Double Header&#x27;. Beşiktaş J.K. of Turkey defeated the American Soccer League All-Stars 3–1, and then Manchester United defeated Jönköping (the top amateur team in Sweden) 4–0. On May 17, 1960, Birmingham City of England played Third Lanark of Scotland and lost 4–1 at the Polo Grounds in New York City. On August 6 of the same year, 25,440 patrons showed up at the Polo Grounds to watch the inaugural International Soccer League Final which saw Bangu of Brazil edge out Kilmarnock FC of Scotland 2–0. Bangu&#x27;s six games on Polo Ground had a total attendance of 104,274. The following year, 1961, may have been the last year documented that soccer was played at the Polo Grounds. The second edition of the International Soccer League held most of its game at the Polo Grounds, with a few games held in Montreal. On July 16, 1961 Shamrock Rovers beat Red Star Belgrade 5–1, on August 9, Dukla Prague beat Everton 7–0, and four days later on August 13, Dukla Prague beat Everton again 2–0, thus winning the Dwight D. Eisenhower Trophy. The combined attendance for both games at the Polo Grounds was 31,627. In domestic league soccer, the Polo Grounds was the home to the New York Nationals of the American Soccer League in 1928.

===Gaelic football===
The New York GAA occasionally played major Gaelic games matches in the Polo Grounds. In Gaelic football, the 1947 All-Ireland final between Cavan and Kerry was held at the Polo Grounds on September 14 of that year. The only time an All-Ireland Senior Final has been played outside Ireland, it was the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA)&#x27;s commemoration of &quot;Black &#x27;47&quot;, the worst year of the Great Famine. New York was chosen as a center for Irish Americans, many descended from Famine exiles. Cavan emerged victorious in the game itself, fondly remembered for Radio Éireann commentator Michael O&#x27;Hehir&#x27;s successful pleas for the broadcast line to be extended as the game had run late. The last Gaelic games match at the Polo Grounds was on June 1, 1958 when another Cavan side beat New York in Gaelic football.

===Boxing===
The Polo Grounds was the site of many famous boxing matches. These included the legendary 1923 heavyweight championship bout between Jack Dempsey and Luis Ángel Firpo, Harry Greb&#x27;s defense of the middleweight championship title against reigning World Welterweight Champion Mickey Walker in July 1925, and Billy Conn&#x27;s near-upset over heavyweight champion Joe Louis in June 1941. It was also the venue for the rematch between World Heavyweight Champion Ingemar Johansson and former champion Floyd Patterson on June 20, 1960. In what turned out to be the last major boxing match at the Polo Grounds, Patterson became the first heavyweight boxer to regain the championship over the Swedish-born Johansson, who almost one year to the day took the crown from Patterson at Yankee Stadium.

===Motorsports===
The Polo Grounds were the site of three different oval tracks. The first track, a ¼ mile dirt oval, was used for midget racing in 1940 and 1941. The second, a 1/5 mile board track, was used briefly in 1948. The final track, a ¼ mile paved oval, was used for stock car racing in 1958 and 1959, after the Giants moved to San Francisco.

==Open-air concert==

A performance of Verdi&#x27;s Requiem took place at the Polo Grounds on June 4, 1916, presented by the National Open Air Festival Society. It was given by a chorus of 1,200 singers (chorus master, Arnaldo Conti), selected from among the leading choral societies of New York; and an augmented New York Philharmonic Orchestra of 120 players. The soloists were Maria Gay, Louise Homer (under the assumed name of &#x27;Lucile Lawrence&#x27;), Giovanni Zenatello (Gay&#x27;s partner) and Leon Rothier, and the performance was conducted by Louis Koemmenich.

==Features for baseball==
===Center field===

One of the oddest features at the Polo Grounds were the deep dimensions in straight away center field. The wall was so far away from home plate, at , that no batter ever hit home runs over it. Before its 1923 reconstruction, only Babe Ruth ever reached the centerfield stands; after 1923 only five players would reach the distant centerfield bleachers. The entire wall in dead center field was considered &quot;in play&quot;, as were the clubhouse windows on the in-play side of the wall. The ground rules of the Polo Grounds were set up so that if a ball went through an open window in the clubhouse, it was a ground rule double, rather than a home run. Since no ball ever reached that area in the life of the stadium, that rule was never tested.

In Game 1 of the 1954 World Series, Giants outfielder Willie Mays made a sensational catch of a fly ball hit by the Cleveland Indians&#x27; Vic Wertz into deep center field, a catch which, in the words of NBC television sports announcer Jack Brickhouse, &quot;must have looked like an optical illusion to a lot of people&quot;, and which turned the tide of that Series in the Giants&#x27; favor.

On October 2, 1936, in Game 2 of the 1936 World Series, Yankees centerfielder Joe DiMaggio made a similar, though far less crucial, catch (his team being ahead 18–4) for the final out of the game. The Giants&#x27; Hank Leiber hit a long fly ball to deep center field that DiMaggio caught in the runway, perhaps 430–440 from the plate, and his momentum carried him partway up the clubhouse steps. He then stopped and turned around, as the crowd stood and acknowledged the departure of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was in attendance that day.

Babe Ruth hit many of his early signature blasts at the Polo Grounds, reaching the center field seats on several occasions. His longest blast at the grounds, over the right-center upper deck in 1921, was estimated at over 550 feet. He also hit several centerfield home runs at other ballparks which exceeded 500 feet. Had Ruth played regularly in the remodeled Polo Grounds, theoretically he would have been capable of hitting the clubhouse if conditions were right. Neither he nor anyone else ever did, but a few came close.

After the 1923 remodeling, only five players ever hit a home run into the center field stands:
* Schoolboy Rowe, while taking batting practice before a pre-season exhibition game on April 8, 1933.
* Luke Easter in a Negro leagues game on July 18, 1948.
* Joe Adcock on April 29, 1953.
* Hank Aaron and Lou Brock on consecutive days (June 17 and 18) in 1962.

===Right field===
The deep center field was complemented by the short right-field fence. Its foul pole was from home, one of the shortest ever used in the major leagues. Since the early 20th century, home runs that just cleared a field&#x27;s shortest fence had been known as &quot;Chinese home runs&quot;, from a stereotype of Chinese immigrant workers as doing the bare minimum required for the low wages they received for menial labor. Within baseball, by the 1940s those home runs were largely associated with the short right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. The 511 career homers hit by Giants outfielder Mel Ott, whose physique and batting technique were not those associated with power hitting, have often been downplayed because a significant number were hit to right at home, a criticism he often responded to by asking why few other hitters in the league were making that hit if it were so easy.

Bobby Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World&quot; that won the 1951 National League pennant for the Giants was hit over the left field fence. But arguably the best-remembered home run hit to the right side was the walk-off three-run shot by Dusty Rhodes, batting for Monte Irvin in the 10th inning of Game 1 of the 1954 Series, after Mays&#x27; catch had kept the Giants tied. It just barely cleared the fence, above the outstretched glove of the leaping outfielder Dave Pope, leading Al López, manager of the heavily favored Indians, to attribute the Giants&#x27; stunning victory in the Series opener to the ballpark&#x27;s unusual dimensions.

===Bullpens===
Both the home and visitors&#x27; bullpens resided on the outfield warning track, situated, respectively, in the right-center and left-center power alleys, each roughly 450 feet from home plate. Anyone seated on the bench was offered some measure of protection from the elements by what has been variously described as an awning, a canopy, or simply the top of the bullpen, as Pittsburgh sportswriter Les Biederman put it when, two years after the ballpark&#x27;s demolition, he reminded readers that this had been the landing spot for Roberto Clemente&#x27;s first major league home run.

===John T. Brush Stairway===
The only part of the Polo Grounds that still remains is the &quot;John T. Brush Stairway&quot;, which runs down Coogan&#x27;s Bluff from Edgecombe Avenue to Harlem River Driveway at about 158th Street. The stairway, named for John T. Brush—the then-recently deceased owner of the Giants—opened in 1913 and led to a ticket booth overlooking the stadium. The stairway reportedly offered a clear view of the stadium for fans who did not purchase tickets to a game. A marker on the stairway reads: &quot;The John T. Brush Stairway Presented By The New York Giants.&quot;

Donations from the New York Giants, Jets, Yankees, Mets, San Francisco Giants, and Major League Baseball enabled a $950,000 restoration project that began in 2011. The restoration was scheduled to be completed in September 2012, but after numerous delays, the restored steps opened finally in early August 2014.

===Polo Grounds light poles===
The light poles from the Polo Grounds remain in use at Phoenix Municipal Stadium, Arizona State University&#x27;s baseball field in Phoenix, Arizona, built in 1964. When the stadium was built, Horace Stoneham, owner of the San Francisco Giants, had the original Polo Grounds light poles shipped there. The Giants held spring training at the stadium&#x27;s predecessor since 1947 and played at the new ballpark during spring training in 1964. The poles were installed in the stadium where they currently remain standing.

==Statistics==

===Dimensions===
Compiled from various photos, baseball annuals, &quot;The Official Encyclopedia of Baseball&quot; (Turkin &amp; Thompson, 1951) and &quot;Green Cathedrals&quot; by Phil Lowry.

The disparities in some of the posted distances, notably straightaway center, have not been fully reconciled by researchers. The closest object in straight center field was the Grant Memorial, followed by the post supporting the overhang of the clubhouse (above which the 483 or 475 signs were posted), and a roll-up door several feet behind the overhang at ground level. The roof of the protruding part of the clubhouse sloped back and met the vertical wall of the larger part of the clubhouse. The exact objects referred to by the numbers 475, 483, and 505 can be speculated but remain unconfirmed. In 1931, additional box seats were built and the infield was moved 8 feet toward center field, while the 483 sign remained as-is. That at least accounts for the 483/475 (and also 433/425) discrepancies, though not identifying precisely what object the 483/475 signs referred to.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-124 (NATO reporting name: Cookpot) is a 56-passenger short-range twin-jet airliner built in the Soviet Union. It was the Soviet Union&#x27;s first operational airliner powered by turbofan engines.

==Design and development==

Developed from the medium-range Tupolev Tu-104 jetliner , the Tu-124 was meant to meet Aeroflot&#x27;s requirement for a regional airliner/jetliner to replace the Ilyushin Il-14 on domestic routes. Resembling a 75% scaled-down Tu-104, the two were hard to tell apart at a distance but it was not a complete copy of the Tu-104. The Tu-124 had a number of refinements, including double-slotted flaps, a large center-section airbrake and automatic spoilers. Unlike the Tu-104, the wing trailing edge inboard of the undercarriage was unswept.

The Tu-124 had a drogue parachute similar to those on military jets like the Lockheed Martin F-16, Chengdu J-10, Avro Vulcan, and Lockheed Martin SR-71 to be used in an emergency landing or landing on a slippery surface and had low pressure tires for operation from unpaved airfields. As on the Tu-104 the engines were installed in the wing roots, but the turbofan engines used less fuel. The installation of the engines close to the fuselage allowed vibrations to be more readily transmitted to the cabin, which reduced passenger comfort, and also reduced the fatigue life of the wing assembly.

The standard seating of the basic version was 44 seats. The first of two prototype, SSSR-45000 (C/N 0350101) made its first flight from Zhukovsky airfield on 24 March 1960. The second prototype, SSSR-45001 (C/N 0350102), followed in June 1960. Two other airframes served as a static test cells. Testing was successful, and the aircraft entered production at Factory 135 at Kharkiv, Ukraine, replacing the Tu-104 in production. Deliveries to Aeroflot began in August 1962, with the type operating its first scheduled passenger service, between Moscow and Tallinn in Estonia, on 2 October 1962.

==Operational history==
Aeroflot was impressed with the flight performance of the Tu-124 and used it on domestic routes from the end of 1962.

The improved Tu-124V, which could seat 56 passengers instead of the 44 of the original model, and which had increased range and maximum takeoff weight, came into service in 1964. An Aeroflot Tu-124V was exhibited at the 1965 Paris Air Show. Despite the aircraft&#x27;s low purchase price (stated as $1.45 million in 1965) and low operating costs, few were exported, with &quot;Československé Státní Aerolinie&quot; (ČSA) and the East German airline Interflug being the only airlines other than Aeroflot that bought the Tu-124 new, although ČSA sold its surviving Tu-124s to Iraqi Airways for use on VIP flights in 1973. Interflug used its three Tu-124s as an alternative to the Ilyushin Il-62, when the Il-62s were grounded due to mechanical issues. All three were sold back to the Soviet Union in 1975.

Three airframes were completed in 1966 in a VIP configuration, and designated Tu-124K. However, Aeroflot never placed them into service, and they were purchased by the Indian Air Force.

A number were also sold to military users, including the Soviet Air Force, which used them as navigational trainers, and to the Chinese Air Force.

A total of 164 Tu-124s were built. Issues with the safety of the Tu-104 affected the fate of the Tu-124, although the reliability of the Tu-124 was slightly better. Production ended in 1965 and Aeroflot decommissioned its last twelve Tu-124s on 21 January 1980. The Tu-124 continued in operation for some years with the Soviet Air Force and in Iraq, but all aircraft were withdrawn before and in 1990, The ones in Iraq military and Iraqi Airways were destroyed in early 1990s during the Gulf War.

Several Tu-124s have been preserved. One is in the museum of the Kharkiv State Aircraft Manufacturing Company (formerly the Tu-124 manufacturer Factory 135), another is in the China Aviation Museum in Beijing, another at the Central Air Force Museum at Monino outside Moscow. A Tu-124K is on display at New Delhi Airport and next to the State Museum at Lucknow Zoo.

<text>The American Numismatic Association (ANA) is an organization founded in 1891 by George Francis Heath. Located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, it was formed to advance the knowledge of numismatics (the study of coins) along educational, historical, and scientific lines, as well as to enhance interest in the hobby.

The ANA has more than 24,000 individual members who receive many benefits, such as discounts, access to website features, and the monthly journal &quot;The Numismatist&quot;. The ANA&#x27;s Colorado Springs headquarters houses its administrative offices, library, and money museum. The ANA received a federal charter from the United States Congress in 1912.

A board of governors is in charge of the ANA. Numerous advisory committees help to operate it properly. The ANA has a Young Numismatists program intended to promote interest among youth. The ANA has held annual conventions throughout the nation in most years since 1891, with two per year since 1978. The Chester L. Krause Memorial Distinguished Service Award is bestowed upon the most dedicated members. The ANA also maintains a Numismatic Hall of Fame.

==History==
Dr. George F. Heath of Monroe, Michigan, gained knowledge of world history by studying his collection of coins. The obscurity of his community was an obstacle towards obtaining certain specimens, and made meeting fellow numismatists difficult. In 1888, he printed, published and distributed a four-page leaflet, NUMISMATIST, in which he listed his coin needs, advertised duplicates for sale, and discussed numismatic topics.

The nascent publication found many friends among other isolated collectors. As Heath&#x27;s subscription list increased, a need for a national organization of numismatists was evident. The February 1891 edition of &quot;The Numismatist&quot; printed a question, &quot;What is the matter with having an American Numismatic Association?&quot; A follow-up statement was included: &quot;There is nothing like the alliance of kindred pursuits to stimulate growth and interest.&quot;

On October 7 and October 8, 1891, five men—Heath, William G. Jerrems, David Harlowe, J.A. Heckelman and John Brydon—holding 26 proxies, met in Chicago with 61 charter members. The result was the founding of the ANA, which has since become the largest non-profit numismatic organization in the world. Heath then introduced the idea of a numismatic convention, where members could make personal contact with other numismatists. The first convention was held in 1891, then annually until 1895, and then in 1901 and 1904. After the 1907 convention in Columbus, Ohio, it was decided to hold annual conventions thereafter.

On June 16, 1908, Dr. Heath suddenly died. Farran Zerbe, then president, assumed the task of editing and publishing &quot;The Numismatist&quot;, and soon purchased the publication from Heath&#x27;s heirs. In 1911, W.C.C. Wilson of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, purchased &quot;The Numismatist&quot; from Zerbe and presented it to the ANA. Since then, the magazine has been owned and published monthly by the ANA.

On May 9, 1912, the ANA attained national prominence as it was granted a Federal Charter signed by President William Howard Taft. In 1962, an amendment to make the Charter permanent and allow for a larger Board was introduced and passed by Congress and signed into law by John F. Kennedy on April 10. The amendment was presented by Congressman Wilbur Mills and Senator John L. McClellan, both of Arkansas.

An ANA national headquarters building fund was established on April 29, 1961. A site in Colorado Springs, Colorado was selected as the headquarter&#x27;s location and a ground breaking ceremony was held on September 6, 1966. On December 20, the $250,000 building fund goal was reached and the new headquarters was dedicated and officially opened on June 10, 1967.

==Headquarters==
The ANA&#x27;s administration operates from its Colorado Springs headquarters. The ANA&#x27;s monthly journal, &quot;The Numismatist&quot;, is produced here. Many articles are contributed by ANA members. The facility houses the largest circulating numismatic library in the world. Books, educational slide programs and instructional videotapes are loaned to members without charge other than costs to cover postage and insurance. The ANA has many affiliate club members throughout the United States, such as the Beverly Hills Coin Club and the Chicago Coin Club.

ANA headquarters contains the ANA Money Museum, which includes over 250,000 objects encompassing the history of numismatics from the earliest invention of money to modern day.

The Harry W. Bass Collection, a feature of the museum from 2000-2022, featured American gold coins, experimental pattern coins and paper money. The collection includes a complete set of three dollar gold coins, including the unique 1870-S specimen, a complete type set of U.S. gold coin designs from 1834 to 1933, and a collection of pattern coins from the United States Mint. In April 2022, the museum announced that the foundation was auctioning off the collection, with the proceeds going to various Dallas-area charities.

The museum also offers changing exhibits about money in history, art, archeology, banking and economics, and coin collecting. Members may study the items on display and, by prearrangement, can use other museum materials for research purposes.

==Membership==
The ANA has nearly 24,000 individual members. Memberships last one year, three years, five years, or a lifetime. The cost of the latter differs, depending on a member&#x27;s age and whether the ANA&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Numismatist&quot;, is mailed or read digitally. Membership is classified into five levels: silver, gold, or platinum, with a &quot;life membership&quot; option available for a one-time payment, and a youth option for kids under 18.

===Dr. George F. Heath Society===
In September 2022, the Association announced the launch of the Dr. George F. Heath Society, a donor recognition guild &quot;devoted to supporting the mission of the ANA and its programming needs, while expanding, educating and inspiring the collecting community&quot;.

==Board of governors==
The ANA is run by a nine-member board of governors composed of the President, Vice-President, and seven Governors, each elected by ANA members in odd-numbered years. Governor candidates must have been ANA members for at least three years. President and Vice President candidates must have served at least one term as a Governor. Total service on the Board is limited to 10 years.

The incumbent board of governors was elected in 2023. The election results were as follows:

==Advisory committees==
The ANA is also served by various advisory committees. There are temporary advisory committees for searches, and one formed for forming a Strategic Vision for the board in 2012. There are several more permanent advisory committees.

==Young Numismatists==
The ANA has many programs for Young Numismatists (YNs). There are currently three programs in which YNs can earn free coins by completing coin-related activities. These programs are the Early American Copper Project, the David R. Cervin Ancient Coin Project, and The Dollar Project. Another program, Coins For A&#x27;s, allows kids to get free coins, plus a basic-level ANA membership by getting A&#x27;s in school. The ANA also has a YN Dollars program in which YNs earn YN Dollars for different activities. They can spend these YN Dollars at the ANA Summer Convention at the annual YN auction. The Young Numismatist of the Year award has been given by the ANA every year since 1968. Many former winners of the award are now prominent numismatic professionals, or have distinguished themselves in other areas.

The Young Numismatists of America (YNA) was a worldwide coin organization founded in 1990 at the ANA Summer Seminar. In its early days, the YNA was an attractive way for young numismatists (YNs) to submit articles for publication. However, by late 1996, many of the YNA founders were in college and could no longer help out. The YNA slowly faded away because of lack of interest. In 2001 at the ANA Summer Seminar, the young collectors decided to reform YNA. Within several years, the YNA once again ceased to exist.

==Events==
The ANA has held conventions annually most years since 1891, and expanded to two annual shows in 1978. The ANA offered a third show in 2011 and 2012, but announced on May 4, 2012 that it will not continue this in 2013. The features of these conventions include the offering of a large bourse room, along with exhibits, educational programs, junior member activities, auctions, and meetings of affiliated specialty organizations. The National Money Show and the ANA World&#x27;s Fair of Money are the brands for shows that have been held on an Annual Basis by the ANA. The National Money Show is traditionally held in the Spring while the World&#x27;s Fair is held in the Summer. The Fall shows in 2011 and 2012 also used the National Money Show brand.

The annual ANA Summer Seminar is an assortment of classes held in Colorado Springs mid-summer (generally the last week of June and first week of July). Most classes are one week long but some weeks have half-week classes available. Classes are taught by numismatic experts. Students are of all ages and divided between collectors and numismatic professionals. There are special programs for Young Numismatists. The ANA and many local coin clubs sponsor a few scholarships to defer some costs for a few students.

==Chester L. Krause Memorial Distinguished Service Award==
The Chester L. Kraause Distinguished Service Award, (formerly the Farran Zerbe Memorial Award) is the highest honor conferred by the ANA. It is given in recognition of numerous years of outstanding, dedicated service to numismatics. The criteria for the nominee should be that the individual is considered someone who has rendered numerous years of outstanding service to the ANA as well as the field of numismatics. An additional qualification is that the nominee should be a former Medal of Merit and Glenn Smedley Memorial Award recipient. The award is limited only to members of the ANA.

*&quot;For a list of winners, please see Chester L. Krause Memorial Distinguished Service Award&quot;

==Hall of Fame==
To enshrine the most important numismatists of all time, the ANA established the Numismatic Hall of Fame at its Colorado Springs headquarters in 1964. The Hall&#x27;s constitution and bylaws were drafted that year, and the first inductees enshrined in 1969 and the next group in 1970, with subsequent honorees inducted every two years thereafter. The Hall was the brainchild of Jack W. Ogilvie, a Hollywood film writer and editor who served as ANA historian from 1950 to 1970.

Prior to each induction year, nominations are accepted from the membership. After review by a five-member Hall of Fame council, the names and qualifications of the nominees are passed on to a 25-member elector panel. Candidates receiving 13 or more votes are inducted; those receiving six to 12 votes are reconsidered in the next election. Members of the council, the ANA board of governors, and ANA appointed officers and staff are ineligible to serve as electors.

The nominees are considered in alternating annual cycles. &quot;Historic Era&quot; nominees (deceased more than 25 years prior to induction) are considered in odd numbered years, and &quot;Modern Era&quot; nominees (living or deceased less than 25 years) are considered in even-numbered years.

<doc id="534396" wikidata="Q501613" url="?curid=534396" title="BMW 5 Series">
<text>The BMW 5 Series is an executive car manufactured and marketed by BMW since 1972. It is the successor to the BMW New Class sedans and is currently in its eighth generation. The car is sold as either a sedan or, since 1991, a station wagon (marketed as &quot;Touring&quot;). A 5-door fastback (marketed as &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;) was sold between 2009 and 2017. Each successive generation has been given an internal &quot;G-code&quot; designation since 2017. Previously, a &quot;F-code&quot; designation was used between 2010 and 2016, while an &quot;E-code&quot; designation was used between 1972 and 2010. These are used to distinguish each model and generation from each other.

The first generation of the 5 Series was powered by naturally aspirated four-cylinder and six-cylinder petrol engines. Following generations have been powered by four-cylinder, six-cylinder, V8 and V10 engines that are either naturally aspirated or turbocharged. Since 1982, diesel engines have been included in the 5 Series range.

The 5 Series is BMW&#x27;s second-best-selling model after the 3 Series. On 29 January 2008, the 5 millionth 5 Series was manufactured, a 530d sedan in Carbon Black Metallic. It is BMW’s oldest nameplate still in production and the first model line to use &quot;Series&quot; in the name, debuting the three-digit model naming convention still used today. Since the E28, all generations of 5 Series have included an &quot;M&quot; model, called the BMW M5.


==First generation (E12; 1972)==

The E12 is the first generation of 5 Series, and was manufactured for model years 1972–1981. It replaced the New Class sedans and was produced in the sedan body style. The initial models were powered by four-cylinder engines, with a six-cylinder engine introduced a year later.

There was no M5 model for the E12, however the E12 M535i is considered the predecessor to the M5.

The E12 was replaced by the E28 in 1981, with South African production continuing until September 1985. The later South African models received the E28&#x27;s interior; this model is called the E12/8.

==Second generation (E28; 1981)==


The E28 is the second generation of 5 Series, manufactured for model years 1981-1988 as a sedan. It was initially offered with petrol four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines.

In 1983, a diesel engine became available for the first time in a 5 Series. The E28 was the first 5 Series with the centre console angled towards the driver and the option of anti-lock brakes (ABS).

The E28 M5 began a line of M5 high performance models that has continued through every generation since. It was powered by the S38B35 and the M88/3 six-cylinder engines.
==Third generation (E34; 1988)==


The E34 is the third generation of the 5 Series, manufactured for model years 1988–1996. It was launched in the sedan body style, with the range expanded in 1990 to include the &quot;Touring&quot; wagon/estate body style.

The E34 was the first 5 Series to be available with the wagon body style, all-wheel drive and V8 engines. It also saw the introduction of stability control (ASC), traction control (ASC+T), a 6-speed manual transmission and adjustable damping (EDC) to the 5 Series range.

Nine different engine families were used over its lifetime, consisting of four-cylinder, six-cylinder and V8 petrol engines, and six-cylinder diesel engines.

The E34 M5 is powered by the S38 six-cylinder engine and was produced in sedan and wagon body styles.

==Fourth generation (E39; 1995)==

The E39 is the fourth generation of 5 Series, which was manufactured for model years 1995–2004. It was launched in the sedan body style, with the wagon/estate body style (marketed as &quot;Touring&quot;) introduced in 1996.

The E39 was the first 5 Series to use aluminium components in the front suspension. The proportion of chassis components using aluminium significantly increased for the E39, in order to reduce weight. It was also the first 5 Series where a four-cylinder diesel engine was available.

V8 models used recirculating ball steering (as per previous 5 Series generations), however rack and pinion steering was used for the first time, in the four-cylinder and six-cylinder models. Unlike its E34 predecessor and E60 successor, the E39 was not available with all-wheel drive.

The E39 M5 sedan was introduced in 1998, powered by the 4.9-litre S62 V8 engine.
==Fifth generation (E60/E61; 2003)==

The E60/E61 is the fifth generation of the 5 Series, which was sold from 2003 to 2010. The body styles of the range are:
* 4-door sedan/saloon (E60 model code)
* 5-door estate/wagon (E61 model code, marketed as &quot;Touring&quot;)

The E60 generation introduced various electronic features to the 5 Series, including iDrive, head-up display, active cruise control, active steering and voice control. The E60 also was the first 5 Series available with a turbocharged petrol engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission and regenerative braking. New safety features for the E60 included adaptive headlights, night vision, active headrests, Lane Departure Warning, and high intensity emergency brake lights. Unlike the three previous generations of 5 Series and the F10 successor, the E60/E61 centre console is not angled towards the driver.

The E60/E61 M5 was released in 2005 and was powered by the S85 V10 engine. It was sold in the sedan and wagon body styles, with most cars using a 7-speed automated manual transmission (&quot;SMG III&quot;). However, in the North American Markets, there was the option to buy the BMW M5 in a manual version. 
==Sixth generation (F10/F11/F07/F18; 2010)==

The BMW F10/F11/F07/F18 is the sixth generation of the BMW 5 Series, which was manufactured for model years 2010–2017. The body styles of the range are:
* 4-door sedan/saloon (F10)
* 5-door estate/wagon (F11, marketed as &quot;Touring&quot;)
* 5-door fastback (F07, marketed as &quot;Gran Turismo&quot;)
* 4-door long wheelbase sedan (F18, sold only in China and the Middle East)

The F07 Gran Turismo was the only 5 Series to date produced as a fastback. The F10 was also the first 5 Series to offer a hybrid drivetrain, a turbocharged V8 engine, an 8-speed automatic transmission, a dual-clutch transmission, active rear-wheel steering (called &quot;Integral Active Steering&quot;), electric power steering, double-wishbone front suspension, an LCD instrument cluster (called &quot;Black Panel Display&quot;) and automatic parking (called &quot;Parking Assistant&quot;).
The F10 M5 was powered by the S63 twin-turbo V8 engine with a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. It was the first M5 to use a turbocharged engine. Like the previous generation, the F10 M5, in North America was sold with a manual transmission.

== Seventh generation (G30/G31/G38; 2017) ==
The BMW G30/G31/G38 is the seventh generation of the 5 Series. It was officially announced in October 2016, and sales began in February 2017. 

Body styles included:
* 4-door sedan/saloon (G30)
* 5-door wagon/estate (G31)
* 4-door long-wheelbase saloon (G38)
The fastback 5 Series GT model from the previous generation is no longer offered, and was moved to the 6 Series range.

The G30 is based on the same modular platform as the 7 Series (G11). The G30 is the first 5 Series to be offered with a plug-in hybrid powertrain, the &quot;530e iPerformance&quot;, which would have the advanced driver-assistance systems found in the 7 Series.
The F90 M5 is the M5 performance model for the G30 generation, and is the first M5 to employ an all-wheel drive powertrain. The X-Drive system allowed for the front differential to disconnect and provide a rear-wheel drive experience to the vehicle. It is powered by an upgraded version of the S63 twin-turbo V8 engine used in the previous generation F10 M5. The 5 Series received a face lift in 2020, retaining the same mechanics and engines. 

== Eighth generation (G60/G61/G68; 2024) ==

The BMW G60/G61/G68 is the eighth generation of the 5 Series. It was revealed on May 24, 2023, and will commence production in summer at BMW&#x27;s Dingolfing Plant in 2023, with first deliveries beginning around October 2023.

Body styles included:
* 4-door sedan/saloon (G60)
* 5-door wagon/estate (G61)
* 4-door long-wheelbase saloon (G68)
The fastback 6 Series Gran Turismo model has been discontinued. The 5-series will be offered in 530i, 540i, and 550e trims, with the 530i containing a 255-hp turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder, offered with rear or all wheel drive. The 540i is standard with all-wheel drive as well as a 375-hp turbocharged inline-six engine. All variants—excluding the plug-in hybrid variants—feature a 48-volt mild hybrid system; this system consists of a 20 Ah lithium-ion and an electric motor/integrated starter-generator rated at and . The 5 Series is claimed to be powerful enough to hit 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds by BMW.

The eighth generation BMW 5 Series is also offered with a battery electric powertrain, dubbed the &quot;i5&quot;. Three models are offered; the entry-level, rear-wheel-drive eDrive40 model, the mid-range, all-wheel-drive xDrive40, and the range topping M60 xDrive model.
==Deliveries and Sales==

Current production is located in Dingolfing, Germany, Shenyang, China and Magna Steyr, Austria.

<text>Semantic memory refers to general world knowledge that humans have accumulated throughout their lives. This general knowledge (word meanings, concepts, facts, and ideas) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. New concepts are learned by applying knowledge learned from things in the past.

Semantic memory is distinct from episodic memory—the memory of experiences and specific events that occur in one&#x27;s life that can be recreated at any given point. For instance, semantic memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of stroking a particular cat.

Semantic memory and episodic memory are both types of explicit memory (or declarative memory), or memory of facts or events that can be consciously recalled and &quot;declared&quot;. The counterpart to declarative or explicit memory is implicit memory (also known as nondeclarative memory).

== History ==
The idea of semantic memory was first introduced following a conference in 1972 between Endel Tulving and W. Donaldson on the role of organization in human memory. Tulving constructed a proposal to distinguish between episodic memory and what he termed semantic memory. He was mainly influenced by the ideas of Reiff and Scheers, who in 1959 made the distinction between two primary forms of memory. One form was titled &quot;remembrances&quot;, and the other &quot;memoria&quot;. The remembrance concept dealt with memories that contained experiences of an autobiographic index, whereas the &quot;memoria&quot; concept dealt with memories that did not reference experiences having an autobiographic index.

Semantic memory reflects the knowledge of the world, and the term &quot;general knowledge&quot; is often used. It holds generic information that is more than likely acquired across various contexts and is used across different situations. According to Madigan in his book titled &quot;Memory&quot;, semantic memory is the sum of all knowledge one has obtained—vocabulary, understanding of math, or all the facts one knows. In his book titled &quot;Episodic and Semantic Memory&quot;, Tulving adopted the term &quot;semantic&quot; from linguists to refer to a system of memory for &quot;words and verbal symbols, their meanings and referents, the relations between them, and the rules, formulas, or algorithms for influencing them&quot;.

The use of semantic memory differs from episodic memory: semantic memory refers to general facts and meanings one shares with others, while episodic memory refers to unique and concrete personal experiences. Tulving&#x27;s proposal of this distinction was widely accepted, primarily because it allowed the separate conceptualization of world knowledge. Tulving discusses conceptions of episodic and semantic memory in his book titled &quot;Précis of Elements of Episodic Memory&quot;, in which he states that several factors differentiate between episodic memory and semantic memory in ways that include

# the characteristics of their operations,
# the kind of information they process, and
# their application to the real world as well as the memory laboratory.

In 2022, researchers Felipe De Brigard, Sharda Umanath, and Muireann Irish argued that Tulving conceptualized semantic memory to be different from episodic memory in that &quot;episodic memories were viewed as supported via spatiotemporal relations while information in semantic memory was mediated through conceptual, meaning-based associations&quot;.

Recent research has focused on the idea that when people access a word&#x27;s meaning, sensorimotor information that is used to perceive and act on the concrete object the word suggests is automatically activated. In the theory of grounded cognition, the meaning of a particular word is grounded in the sensorimotor systems. For example, when one thinks of a pear, knowledge of grasping, chewing, sights, sounds, and tastes used to encode episodic experiences of a pear are recalled through sensorimotor simulation.

A grounded simulation approach refers to context-specific re-activations that integrate the important features of episodic experience into a current depiction. Such research has challenged previously utilized amodal views. The brain encodes multiple inputs such as words and pictures to integrate and create a larger conceptual idea by using amodal views (also known as amodal perception). Instead of being representations in modality-specific systems, semantic memory representations had previously been viewed as redescriptions of modality-specific states. Some accounts of category-specific semantic deficits that are amodal remain even though researchers are beginning to find support for theories in which knowledge is tied to modality-specific brain regions. The concept that semantic representations are grounded across modality-specific brain regions can be supported by episodic and semantic memory appearing to function in different yet mutually dependent ways. The distinction between semantic and episodic memory has become a part of the broader scientific discourse. For example, researchers speculate that semantic memory captures the stable aspects of our personality while episodes of illness may have a more episodic nature.

== Empirical evidence==
=== Jacoby and Dallas (1981) ===

This study was not created to solely provide evidence for the distinction of semantic and episodic memory stores. However, they did use the experimental dissociation method which provides evidence for Tulving&#x27;s hypothesis.

In the first part, subjects were presented with a total of 60 words (one at a time) and were asked different questions.

* Some questions asked were to cause the subject to pay attention to the visual appearance: Is the word typed in bold letters?
* Some questions caused the participants to pay attention to the sound of the word: Does the word rhyme with ball?
* Some questions caused the subjects to pay attention to the meaning of the word: Does the word refer to a form of communication?
* Half of the questions were &quot;no&quot; answers and the other half &quot;yes&quot;

In the second phase of the experiment, 60 &quot;old words&quot; seen in stage one and 20 &quot;new words&quot; not shown in stage one were presented to the subjects one at a time.

The subjects were given one of two tasks:

* Perceptual identification task: The words were flashed on a video-screen for 35 milliseconds and the subjects were required to say what the word was.
* Episodic recognition task: Subjects were presented with each word and had to decide whether they had seen the word in the previous stage of the experiment.
Results showed that the percentage of correct answers in the semantic task (perceptual identification) did not change with the encoding conditions of appearance, sound, or meaning. The percentage of correct answers for the episodic task increased from the appearance condition (.50), to the sound condition (.63), to the meaning condition (.86). The effect was also greater for the &quot;yes&quot; encoding words than the &quot;no&quot; encoding words, which suggested a strong distinction of performance of episodic and semantic tasks, supporting Tulving&#x27;s hypothesis.

== Models ==
Semantic memory&#x27;s contents are not tied to any particular instance of experience, as in episodic memory. Instead, what is stored in semantic memory is the &quot;gist&quot; of experience, an abstract structure that applies to a wide variety of experiential objects and delineates categorical and functional relationships between such objects. There are numerous sub-theories related to semantic memory that have developed since Tulving initially posited his argument on the differences between semantic and episodic memory; an example is the belief in hierarchies of semantic memory, in which different information one has learned with specific levels of related knowledge is associated. According to this theory, brains are able to associate specific information with other disparate ideas despite not having unique memories that correspond to when that knowledge was stored in the first place. This theory of hierarchies has also been applied to episodic memory, as in the case of work by William Brewer on the concept of autobiographical memory.

=== Network models ===
Networks of various sorts play an integral part in many theories of semantic memory. Generally speaking, a network is composed of a set of nodes connected by links. The nodes may represent concepts, words, perceptual features, or nothing at all. The links may be weighted such that some are stronger than others or, equivalently, have a length such that some links take longer to traverse than others. All these features of networks have been employed in models of semantic memory.

====Teachable language comprehender====
One of the first examples of a network model of semantic memory is the teachable language comprehender (TLC). In this model, each node is a word, representing a concept (like &quot;bird&quot;). Within each node is stored a set of properties (like &quot;can fly&quot; or &quot;has wings&quot;) as well as links to other nodes (like &quot;chicken&quot;). A node is directly linked to those nodes of which it is either a subclass or superclass (i.e., &quot;bird&quot; would be connected to both &quot;chicken&quot; and &quot;animal&quot;). Properties are stored at the highest category level to which they apply; for example, &quot;is yellow&quot; would be stored with &quot;canary&quot;, &quot;has wings&quot; would be stored with &quot;bird&quot; (one level up), and &quot;can move&quot; would be stored with &quot;animal&quot; (another level up). Nodes may also store negations of the properties of their superordinate nodes (i.e., &quot;NOT-can fly&quot; would be stored with &quot;penguin&quot;).

Processing in TLC is a form of spreading activation. When a node becomes active, that activation spreads to other nodes via the links between them. In that case, the time to answer the question &quot;Is a chicken a bird?&quot; is a function of how far the activation between the nodes for &quot;chicken&quot; and &quot;bird&quot; must spread, or the number of links between those nodes.

The original version of TLC did not put weights on the links between nodes. This version performed comparably to humans in many tasks, but failed to predict that people would respond faster to questions regarding more typical category instances than those involving less typical instances. Allan Collins and Quillian later updated TLC to include weighted connections to account for this effect, which allowed it to explain both the familiarity effect and the typicality effect. Its biggest advantage is that it clearly explains priming: information from memory is more likely to be retrieved if related information (the &quot;prime&quot;) has been presented a short time before. There are still a number of memory phenomena for which TLC has no account, including why people are able to respond quickly to obviously false questions (like &quot;is a chicken a meteor?&quot;) when the relevant nodes are very far apart in the network.

====Semantic networks====
TLC is an instance of a more general class of models known as semantic networks. In a semantic network, each node is to be interpreted as representing a specific concept, word, or feature; each node is a symbol. Semantic networks generally do not employ distributed representations for concepts, as may be found in a neural network. The defining feature of a semantic network is that its links are almost always directed (that is, they only point in one direction, from a base to a target) and the links come in many different types, each one standing for a particular relationship that can hold between any two nodes. 

Semantic networks see the most use in models of discourse and logical comprehension, as well as in artificial intelligence. In these models, the nodes correspond to words or word stems and the links represent syntactic relations between them.

===Feature models===
Feature models view semantic categories as being composed of relatively unstructured sets of features. The semantic feature-comparison model describes memory as being composed of feature lists for different concepts. According to this view, the relations between categories would not be directly retrieved, and would be indirectly computed instead. For example, subjects might verify a sentence by comparing the feature sets that represent its subject and predicate concepts. Such computational feature-comparison models include the ones proposed by Meyer (1970), Rips (1975), and Smith &quot;et al.&quot; (1974).

Early work in perceptual and conceptual categorization assumed that categories had critical features and that category membership could be determined by logical rules for the combination of features. More recent theories have accepted that categories may have an ill-defined or &quot;fuzzy&quot; structure and have proposed probabilistic or global similarity models for the verification of category membership.

===Associative models===
The set of associations among a collection of items in memory is equivalent to the links between nodes in a network, where each node corresponds to a unique item in memory. Indeed, neural networks and semantic networks may be characterized as associative models of cognition. However, associations are often more clearly represented as an &quot;N&quot;×&quot;N&quot; matrix, where &quot;N&quot; is the number of items in memory; each cell of the matrix corresponds to the strength of the association between the row item and the column item.

Learning of associations is generally believed to be a Hebbian process, where whenever two items in memory are simultaneously active, the association between them grows stronger, and the more likely either item is to activate the other. See below for specific operationalizations of associative models.

====Search of associative memory====
A standard model of memory that employs association in this manner is the search of associative memory (SAM) model. Though SAM was originally designed to model episodic memory, its mechanisms are sufficient to support some semantic memory representations. The model contains a short-term store (STS) and long-term store (LTS), where STS is a briefly activated subset of the information in the LTS. The STS has limited capacity and affects the retrieval process by limiting the amount of information that can be sampled and limiting the time the sampled subset is in an active mode. The retrieval process in LTS is cue dependent and probabilistic, meaning that a cue initiates the retrieval process and the selected information from memory is random. The probability of being sampled is dependent on the strength of association between the cue and the item being retrieved, with stronger associations being sampled before one is chosen. The buffer size is defined as &quot;r&quot;, and not a fixed number, and as items are rehearsed in the buffer the associative strengths grow linearly as a function of the total time inside the buffer. In SAM, when any two items simultaneously occupy a working memory buffer, the strength of their association is incremented; items that co-occur more often are more strongly associated. Items in SAM are also associated with a specific context, where the strength of that association determined by how long each item is present in a given context. In SAM, memories consist of a set of associations between items in memory and between items and contexts. The presence of a set of items and/or a context is more likely to evoke some subset of the items in memory. The degree to which items evoke one another—either by virtue of their shared context or their co-occurrence—is an indication of the items&#x27; semantic relatedness.

In an updated version of SAM, pre-existing semantic associations are accounted for using a semantic matrix. During the experiment, semantic associations remain fixed showing the assumption that semantic associations are not significantly impacted by the episodic experience of one experiment. The two measures used to measure semantic relatedness in this model are latent semantic analysis (LSA) and word association spaces (WAS). The LSA method states that similarity between words is reflected through their co-occurrence in a local context. WAS was developed by analyzing a database of free association norms, and is where &quot;words that have similar associative structures are placed in similar regions of space&quot;.

====ACT-R: a production system model====
The adaptive control of thought (ACT) (and later ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational)) theory of cognition represents declarative memory (of which semantic memory is a part) as &quot;chunks&quot;, which consist of a label, a set of defined relationships to other chunks (e.g., &quot;this is a _&quot;, or &quot;this has a _&quot;), and any number of chunk-specific properties. Chunks can be mapped as a semantic network, given that each node is a chunk with its unique properties, and each link is the chunk&#x27;s relationship to another chunk. In ACT, a chunk&#x27;s activation decreases as a function of the time from when the chunk was created, and increases with the number of times the chunk has been retrieved from memory. Chunks can also receive activation from Gaussian noise and from their similarity to other chunks. For example, if &quot;chicken&quot; is used as a retrieval cue, &quot;canary&quot; will receive activation by virtue of its similarity to the cue. When retrieving items from memory, ACT looks at the most active chunk in memory; if it is above threshold, it is retrieved; otherwise an &quot;error of omission&quot; has occurred and the item has been forgotten. There is also retrieval latency, which varies inversely with the amount by which the activation of the retrieved chunk exceeds the retrieval threshold. This latency is used to measure the response time of the ACT model and compare it to human performance.

===Statistical models===
Some models characterize the acquisition of semantic information as a form of statistical inference from a set of discrete experiences, distributed across a number of contexts. Though these models differ in specifics, they generally employ an (Item × Context) matrix where each cell represents the number of times an item in memory has occurred in a given context. Semantic information is gleaned by performing a statistical analysis of this matrix.

Many of these models bear similarity to the algorithms used in search engines, though it is not yet clear whether they really use the same computational mechanisms.

====Latent semantic analysis====
One of the more popular models is latent semantic analysis (LSA). In LSA, a T × D matrix is constructed from a text corpus, where T is the number of terms in the corpus and D is the number of documents (here &quot;context&quot; is interpreted as &quot;document&quot; and only words—or word phrases—are considered as items in memory). Each cell in the matrix is then transformed according to the equation:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the probability that context formula_3 is active, given that item formula_4 has occurred (this is obtained simply by dividing the raw frequency, formula_5 by the total of the item vector, formula_6).

====Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL)====
The Hyperspace Analogue to Language (HAL) model considers context only as the words that immediately surround a given word. HAL computes an NxN matrix, where N is the number of words in its lexicon, using a 10-word reading frame that moves incrementally through a corpus of text. Like SAM, any time two words are simultaneously in the frame, the association between them is increased, that is, the corresponding cell in the NxN matrix is incremented. The bigger the distance between the two words, the smaller the amount by which the association is incremented (specifically, formula_7, where formula_8 is the distance between the two words in the frame).

== Location of semantic memory in the brain ==
The cognitive neuroscience of semantic memory is a controversial issue with two dominant views.

Many researchers and clinicians believe that semantic memory is stored by the same brain systems involved in episodic memory, that is, the medial temporal lobes, including the hippocampal formation. In this system, the hippocampal formation &quot;encodes&quot; memories, or makes it possible for memories to form at all, and the neocortex stores memories after the initial encoding process is completed. Recently, new evidence has been presented in support of a more precise interpretation of this hypothesis. The hippocampal formation includes, among other structures: the hippocampus itself, the entorhinal cortex, and the perirhinal cortex. These latter two make up the parahippocampal cortices. Amnesiacs with damage to the hippocampus but some spared parahippocampal cortex were able to demonstrate some degree of intact semantic memory despite a total loss of episodic memory, which strongly suggests that information encoding leading to semantic memory does not have its physiological basis in the hippocampus.

Other researchers believe the hippocampus is only involved in episodic memory and spatial cognition, which raises the question of where semantic memory may be located. Some believe semantic memory lives in the temporal cortex, while others believe that it is widely distributed across all brain areas.

== Neural correlates and biological workings ==
The hippocampal areas associate semantic memory with declarative memory. The left inferior prefrontal cortex and the left posterior temporal areas are other areas involved in semantic memory use. Temporal lobe damage affecting the lateral and medial cortexes have been related to semantic impairments. Damage to different areas of the brain affect semantic memory differently.

Neuroimaging evidence suggests that left hippocampal areas show an increase in activity during semantic memory tasks. During semantic retrieval, two regions in the right middle frontal gyrus and the area of the right inferior temporal gyrus similarly show an increase in activity. Damage to areas involved in semantic memory result in various deficits, depending on the area and type of damage. For instance, Lambon Ralph, Lowe, &amp; Rogers (2007) found that category-specific impairments can occur where patients have different knowledge deficits for one semantic category over another, depending on location and type of damage. Category-specific impairments might indicate that knowledge may rely differentially upon sensory and motor properties encoded in separate areas (Farah and McClelland, 1991).

Category-specific impairments can involve cortical regions where living and nonliving things are represented and where feature and conceptual relationships are represented. Depending on the damage to the semantic system, one type might be favored over the other. In many cases, there is a point where one domain is better than the other (such as the representation of living and nonliving things over feature and conceptual relationships or vice versa).

Different diseases and disorders can affect the biological workings of semantic memory. A variety of studies have been done in an attempt to determine the effects on varying aspects of semantic memory. For example, Lambon, Lowe, &amp; Rogers studied the different effects semantic dementia and herpes simplex virus encephalitis have on semantic memory. They found that semantic dementia has a more generalized semantic impairment. Additionally, deficits in semantic memory as a result of herpes simplex virus encephalitis tend to have more category-specific impairments. Other disorders that affect semantic memory, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, has been observed clinically as errors in naming, recognizing, or describing objects. Whereas researchers have attributed such impairment to degradation of semantic knowledge.

Various neural imaging and research points to semantic memory and episodic memory resulting from distinct areas in the brain. Other research suggests that both semantic memory and episodic memory are part of a singular declarative memory system, yet represent different sectors and parts within the greater whole. Different areas within the brain are activated depending on whether semantic or episodic memory is accessed.

== Disorders==
=== Category-specific semantic impairments ===
Category-specific semantic impairments are a neuropsychological occurrence in which an individual ability to identify certain categories of objects is selectively impaired while other categories remain undamaged. This condition can result in brain damage that is widespread, patchy, or localized. Research suggests that the temporal lobe, more specifically the structural description system, might be responsible for category specific impairments of semantic memory disorders.

Theories on category-specific semantic deficits tend to fall into two different groups based on their underlying principles. Theories based on the correlated structure principle, which states that conceptual knowledge organization in the brain is a reflection of how often an object&#x27;s properties occur, assume that the brain reflects the statistical relation of object properties and how they relate to each other. Theories based on the neural structure principle, which states that the conceptual knowledge organization in the brain is controlled by representational limits imposed by the brain itself, assume that organization is internal. These theories assume that natural selective pressures have caused neural circuits specific to certain domains to be formed, and that these are dedicated to problem-solving and survival. Animals, plants, and tools are all examples of specific circuits that would be formed based on this theory.

==== Impairment categories ====
Category-specific semantic deficits tend to fall into two different categories, each of which can be spared or emphasized depending on the individual&#x27;s specific deficit. The first category consists of animate objects, with animals being the most common deficit. The second category consists of inanimate objects with two subcategories: fruits and vegetables (biological inanimate objects), and artifacts being the most common deficits. The type of deficit does not indicate a lack of conceptual knowledge associated with that category, as the visual system used to identify and describe the structure of objects functions independently of an individual&#x27;s conceptual knowledge base.

Most of the time, these two categories are consistent with case-study data. However, there are a few exceptions to the rule. Categories like food, body parts, and musical instruments have been shown to defy the animate/inanimate or biological/non-biological categorical division. In some cases, it has been shown that musical instruments tend to be impaired in patients with damage to the living things category despite the fact that musical instruments fall in the non-biological/inanimate category. However, there are also cases of biological impairment where musical instrument performance is at a normal level. Similarly, food has been shown to be impaired in those with biological category impairments. The category of food specifically can present some irregularities though because it can be natural, but it can also be highly processed, such as in a case study of an individual who had impairments for vegetables and animals, while their category for food remained intact.

=== The role of modality ===
Modality refers to a semantic category of meaning that has to do with necessity and probability expressed through language. In linguistics, certain expressions are said to have modal meanings. A few examples of this include conditionals, auxiliary verbs, adverbs, and nouns. When looking at category-specific semantic deficits, there is another kind of modality that looks at word relationships which is much more relevant to these disorders and impairments.

For category-specific impairments, there are modality-specific theories that are based on a few general predictions. These theories state that damage to the visual modality will result in a deficit of biological objects, while damage to the functional modality will result in a deficit of non-biological objects (artifacts). Modality-based theories assume that if there is damage to modality-specific knowledge, then all the categories that fall under it will be damaged. In this case, damage to the visual modality would result in a deficit for all biological objects with no deficits restricted to the more specific categories. For example, there would be no category specific semantic deficits for just &quot;animals&quot; or just &quot;fruits and vegetables&quot;.

==== Category-specific semantic deficit causes ====

===== Semantic dementia =====
Semantic dementia is a semantic memory disorder that causes patients to lose the ability to match words or images to their meanings. It is fairly rare for patients with semantic dementia to develop category specific impairments, though there have been documented cases of it occurring. Typically, a more generalized semantic impairment results from dimmed semantic representations in the brain.

Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is a subcategory of semantic dementia which can cause similar symptoms. The main difference between the two is that Alzheimer&#x27;s is categorized by atrophy to both sides of the brain, while semantic dementia is categorized by loss of brain tissue in the front portion of the left temporal lobe. With Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in particular, interactions with semantic memory produce different patterns in deficits between patients and categories over time which is caused by distorted representations in the brain. For example, in the initial onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, patients have mild difficulty with the artifacts category. As the disease progresses, the category specific semantic deficits progress as well, and patients see a more concrete deficit with natural categories. In other words, the deficit tends to be worse with living things as opposed to non-living things.

===== Herpes simplex virus encephalitis =====
Herpes simplex virus encephalitis (HSVE) is a neurological disorder which causes inflammation of the brain. Early symptoms include headache, fever, and drowsiness, but over time symptoms including diminished ability to speak, memory loss, and aphasia develop. HSVE can also cause category-specific semantic deficits to occur. When this happens, patients typically have temporal lobe damage that affects the medial and lateral cortex as well as the frontal lobe. Studies have also shown that patients with HSVE have a much higher incidence of category-specific semantic deficits than those with semantic dementia, though both cause a disruption of flow through the temporal lobe.

==== Brain lesions ====
A brain lesion refers to any abnormal tissue in or on the brain, most often caused by a trauma or infection. In one case study, a patient underwent surgery to remove an aneurysm, and the surgeon had to clip the anterior communicating artery which resulted in basal forebrain and fornix lesions. Before surgery, this patient was completely independent and had no semantic memory issues. However, after the operation and the lesions developed, the patient reported difficulty with naming and identifying objects, recognition tasks, and comprehension. The patient had a much more significant amount of trouble with objects in the living category which could be seen in the drawings of animals which the patient was asked to do and in the data from the matching and identification tasks. Every lesion is different, but in this case study researchers suggested that the semantic deficits presented themselves as a result of disconnection of the temporal lobe. The findings led to the conclusion that any type of lesion in the temporal lobe, depending on severity and location, has the potential to cause semantic deficits.

==== Semantic differences in gender ====
The following table summarizes conclusions from the &quot;Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology&quot;.

These results give a baseline for the differences in semantic knowledge across gender for healthy subjects. Experimental data observes that males with category-specific semantic deficits are mainly impaired with fruits and vegetables while women with category specific semantic deficits are mainly impaired with animals and artifacts. It has been concluded that there are significant gender differences when it comes to category-specific semantic deficits, and that the patient will tend to be impaired in categories that had less existing knowledge to begin with.

===Modality-specific impairments===
Semantic memory is also discussed in reference to modality. Different components represent information from different sensorimotor channels. Modality specific impairments are divided into separate subsystems on the basis of input modality. Examples of different input modalities include visual, auditory, and tactile input. Modality-specific impairments are also divided into subsystems based on the type of information. Visual vs. verbal and perceptual vs. functional information are examples of information types.

===Semantic memory disorders===
Semantic memory disorders fall into two groups. Semantic refractory access disorders are contrasted with semantic storage disorders according to four factors: temporal factors, response consistency, frequency, and semantic relatedness. A key feature of semantic refractory access disorders is temporal distortions, where decreases in response time to certain stimuli are noted when compared to natural response times. In access disorders there are inconsistencies in comprehending and responding to stimuli that have been presented many times. Temporal factors impact response consistency. In storage disorders, an inconsistent response to specific items is not observed. Stimulus frequency determines performance at all stages of cognition. Extreme word frequency effects are common in semantic storage disorders while in semantic refractory access disorders word frequency effects are minimal. The comparison of close and distant groups tests semantic relatedness. Close groupings have words that are related because they are drawn from the same category, such as a list of clothing types. Distant groupings contain words with broad categorical differences, such as unrelated words. Comparing close and distant groups shows that in access disorders semantic relatedness had a negative effect, which is not observed in semantic storage disorders. Category-specific and modality-specific impairments are important components in access and storage disorders of semantic memory.

== Present and future research ==
Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allow cognitive neuroscientists to explore different hypotheses concerning the neural network organization of semantic memory. By using these neuroimaging techniques researchers can observe the brain activity of participants while they perform cognitive tasks. These tasks can include, but are not limited to, naming objects, deciding if two stimuli belong in the same object category, or matching pictures to their written or spoken names.

A developing theory is that semantic memory, like perception, can be subdivided into types of visual information—color, size, form, and motion. Thompson-Schill (2003) found that the left or bilateral ventral temporal cortex appears to be involved in retrieval of knowledge of color and form, the left lateral temporal cortex in knowledge of motion, and the parietal cortex in knowledge of size.

Neuroimaging studies suggest a large, distributed network of semantic representations that are organized minimally by attribute, and perhaps additionally by category. These networks include &quot;extensive regions of ventral (form and color knowledge) and lateral (motion knowledge) temporal cortex, parietal cortex (size knowledge), and premotor cortex (manipulation knowledge). Other areas, such as more anterior regions of temporal cortex, may be involved in the representation of nonperceptual (e.g. verbal) conceptual knowledge, perhaps in some categorically-organized fashion.&quot;

<doc id="534405" wikidata="Q247164" url="?curid=534405" title="John of Tobolsk">
<text>John of Tobolsk (; 1651–1715) was born as Ioann Maksimovich Vasilkovskiy () in Nieżyn, in the Czernihow Voivodeship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was the only one of the seven sons of Maksym Wasylkowski Maksymowicz to enter the service of the Eastern Orthodox Church, in which he was appointed &quot;manager&quot; of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra by 1678. As Bishop Theodore of Uglich wanted someone to succeed him of Chernigov, he appointed John as Archimandrite of the Eletsky Monastery in 1695. Bishop Theodore of Uglich reposed in 1696 and John became Archbishop of Chernigov.

During his pastorate in Chernigov, John distinguished himself by operating a spiritual academy, writing prose and poetry inspired by faith, and inspiring faith in others. His most famous work is &quot;Iliotropion&quot;, which he translated and adapted into Slavonic and Russian from the original Latin of the German Jesuit priest Jeremias Drexel. In the early 21st century, it remains the standard work on theodicy among the Eastern Orthodox.

In 1711, he was made Metropolitan of the Siberian city of Tobolsk, taking the place of Metropolitan Philotheos who wished to carry out missionary work among pagan tribes in remote places.

John died peacefully in 1715, inside his quarters while at prayer. John was honoured as a saint in Siberia by longstanding local veneration. His canonization was supported by Rasputin. In 1916 the Russian Orthodox Church officially glorified (canonized) him for veneration throughout the church. His feast day is June 10, the anniversary of his death.

John of Tobolsk is the namesake of John of Shanghai and San Francisco.

<text>Wigwag is a nickname for a type of railroad grade crossing signal once common in North America, referring to its pendulum-like motion that signaled a train&#x27;s approach. The device is generally credited to Albert Hunt, a mechanical engineer at Southern California&#x27;s Pacific Electric (PE) interurban streetcar railroad, who invented it in 1909 for safer railroad grade crossings. The term should not be confused with its usage in Britain, where &quot;wigwag&quot; generally refers to alternate flashing lights, such as those found at modern level crossings.

==Rationale==
Soon after the advent of the automobile, travel speeds were increasing and the popularity of enclosed cars made the concept of &quot;stop, look, and listen&quot; at railroad crossings difficult. Fatalities at crossings were increasing. Though the idea of automatic grade crossing protection was not new, no one had invented a fail-safe, universally recognized system. In those days, many crossings were protected by a watchman who warned of an oncoming train by swinging a red lantern in a side-to-side arc, used universally in the United States to signify &quot;stop&quot;. This motion is still used today by railroad workers to indicate stop per the General Code of Operating Rules (GCOR) Rule 5.3.1. It was presumed that a mechanical device that mimicked that movement would get the attention of approaching motorists and give an unmistakable warning.

==Design==

The earliest wigwags used by Pacific Electric, built in the railroad&#x27;s shops, were gear-driven, but proved difficult to maintain. The final design, first installed in 1914 at a busy crossing near Long Beach, California, utilized alternating electromagnets pulling on an iron armature. A red steel target disc, slightly less than in diameter was attached, which served as a pendulum. There was a red light in the center of the target, and with each swing of the target a mechanical gong sounded.

The new model, combining sight, motion and sound, was dubbed the &quot;magnetic flagman&quot;, and was manufactured by the Magnetic Signal Company of Los Angeles, California, though it is unclear exactly when production began. After the distinctive signals were installed, train and car collisions decreased at PE grade crossings. The signs became so common throughout the area that they were near-icons of Southern California motoring. Their popularity led to Magnetic Signal wigwags appearing at railroad crossings across the United States—including on Alaska&#x27;s Copper River and Northwestern Railway and on several Hawaiian railroads—and across Canada, Mexico, and as far away as Australia. There are also photographs of the Magnetic Flagman in use in Europe.
Three mechanically-identical versions were produced. The &quot;upper-quadrant&quot; model was mounted directly atop a steel pole and waved the target above the motor box. It was intended for use where space was limited. Since the target could not serve as the pendulum, a cast iron counterweight opposite the target was used. Accurate computer-generated animation of that type of signal can be seen in the 2006 movie, &quot;Cars&quot;. The &quot;lower-quadrant&quot; version waved the target below the motor box and was intended to be cantilevered from a pole, over road traffic. Some railroads, especially in the north-western US, mounted their lower quadrant versions directly on top of a tall steel pole similar to the upper quadrant signal. They were placed on one side of the road, or on an island in the center of the road, and often had crossbucks fastened on top of the motor box. A lower quadrant signal of that kind is seen in the 2004 film &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;.

Though Magnetic Signal manufactured a steel pole and cast-iron base for the purpose (which served as a cabinet for backup batteries and relays), PE often mounted the cantilevers on the wooden poles that also supported the overhead catenary providing power for streetcars. That rendered batteries unnecessary, since any failure of PE&#x27;s generators resulted in a shutdown of the railway. It also permitted the relays to be housed in a separate, inexpensive cabinet, reducing the cost of the installation.
The third and least common version was a pole-mounted lower-quadrant signal, with the motor box fixed to the top of an octagonal steel frame that surrounded the target, presumably to protect both banner and motor box from being damaged by road vehicles. Dubbed the &quot;peach basket&quot; because of the protective framework, the apparatus was crowned by another visual warning, the traditional X-shaped &quot;RAILROAD CROSSING&quot; sign, or crossbucks. The majority of peach baskets were used by the Union Pacific Railroad. One version of the signal had the lower stripe on the banner replaced with the word stop that was lighted. When the signal was at rest, the words were hidden behind a screen that was painted to look like the missing stripe. They were either mounted on an island in the center of the road or on the side of the road.

The Magnetic Flagman wigwag waves its target using large, black electromagnets pulling against an iron armature. Sliding contacts switch the current from one magnet to the other. Each Magnetic Flagman includes a builder&#x27;s plate (bottom center) detailing patent dates and power requirements.

There were a few other models that were either manufactured by Magnetic Signal or customized by the different railroads. Some examples included two signals on the same pole for different traffic approaches, a circular upper quadrant signal in which the target swung in a circular frame, and three-position signals where the target was hidden behind a sign when the signal was inactive. The Norfolk and Western Railway decided to make a change in which the motion-limiting bumpers were placed on the front of the signal instead of inside at the rear, so that the torque on the armature was reduced. They also had unique lights on their banners.
Any version could be ordered to operate using the railroad signal standard of 8 volts DC (VDC) current, or the 600 VDC used to power streetcars and electric locomotives, with little more than a change in the electromagnets. Most, if not all, of the 600 VDC units were used by PE. With the conversion to diesel power after PE sold its passenger operations in 1953, those 600 VDC wigwags were gradually converted to 8 VDC units. There were also some 110 volt AC models of Magnetic Flagman used on several railroads, including Norfolk and Western, Winston-Salem Southbound, and the Milwaukee Road. Since AC power did not generate good torque, a coil cutoff device was installed that utilized all four magnets until full motion of the banner was obtained, then two of the magnets went off line and movement was maintained by the remaining two magnets.

Various options were available. One was a round, counterbalancing &quot;sail&quot; for use in windy areas and which was sometimes painted in the same scheme as the main target. A warning light with adjustable housing was offered, as was an &quot;OUT OF ORDER&quot; warning sign that dropped into view if power to the signal was interrupted. There was a rare adjustable turret-style mount for properly aiming the signal if space did not allow the cantilever to fully extend over the roadway. The last known example of the turret-mounted wigwag was removed from service in Gardena, California in 2000, while the versions with the warning signs were mostly shipped to Australia. One surviving example is on display at the Newport Railway Museum in Melbourne, Victoria, and one has been restored and now operates on the Puffing Billy Railway. An example or two of each signal still survive with collectors.

A ruling by the United States Interstate Commerce Commission mandated a change in the target in the early 1930s. It required a change in the paint scheme from solid red to a black cross and border on a white background, but there was no other change until a ruling that required the alternating red lights in use today. That, along with other rules about grade crossing signaling that the wigwags were unable to meet due to their power requirements, rendered them obsolete for new installations after 1949, but grandfathering laws allowed them to remain until the crossings they protected were upgraded. The Magnetic Signal Company was sold to the Griswold Signal Company of Minneapolis shortly after World War II. Production of new signals continued until 1949, and replacement parts until 1960.

The symbol of a black cross on a white background was adopted in the US as the traffic sign warning drivers about an unprotected grade crossing and was incorporated into the corporate logo of the Santa Fe Railroad. It remains in use today, although with a yellow background and the cross rotated 45 degrees into an &quot;X&quot;. Some railroads, among them the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, used a concentric black circle on a white background, resembling a bullseye, but that scheme was rare, partly because the L&amp;N used few wigwags.

== In modern America and elsewhere ==
Few wigwag signals currently remain in place, and the number dwindles as crossings are upgraded and spare parts become scarce. Once broken down and sold (or given away) as scrap as modern flashers took their place, they are now railroad collectibles, commanding a hefty price and winding up in personal collections of railroad officials, train spotters, and other individual collectors. Magnetic Flagman made in Minneapolis, Minnesota after production was moved from Los Angeles are especially rare and are valued by collectors.
Although many wig wags are still used by heritage railroads and railroad museums, there are only 14 railroad crossings with at least one wigwag remaining in use for regular railroads in the United States as of 2022. All 14 are in California. There is also a non-working example located in Pullman, Washington. This is stark contrast from Federal Railroad Administration data from 2004, showing there were 1,098 railroad crossings in the United States having one or more wigwags as their warning device. Of those 1,098 crossings having wigwags, 398 were in California, 117 in Wisconsin, 97 in Illinois, 66 in Texas and 45 in Kansas. The 2004 data showed a total of 44 states have at least one railroad crossing having a wigwag as its warning device. A previous FRA publication from 1983 showed 2,618 crossings equipped with wigwags.

The last wigwag on a main rail line, a Magnetic Flagman upper-quadrant at a rural crossing in Delhi, Colorado on the BNSF Railway, was removed in March 2021 and now resides at the Colorado Railroad Museum. Until destroyed by a truck in April 2004, a lower-quadrant Magnetic Flagman wigwag protected a private crossing of a BNSF line hidden from public view by a sound barrier in Pittsburg, California. The wigwag, the last &quot;Model 10&quot; in active use, was replaced by standard highway flashers. The Model 10 was distinguished by its short, low-hanging cantilever and use of crossbucks mounted higher than the cantilever. They were almost exclusively used by the Santa Fe, although there were also a few of this model on the Southern Pacific. In 2011–12, working replica wigwags were installed at Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim, California along the Red Car Trolley as well as show wigwags that were placed in Radiator Springs Racers.

Anaheim had a working signal along the Union Pacific Costa Mesa branch at Lemon and Santa Ana Streets before being removed on February 25, 2019. This same signal may have been featured in the 1922 Magnetic Flagman catalog.

Collector and notable film director, Chris M. Allport owns and operates a restored, lower-quadrant Magnetic Flagman (made in Minneapolis) wigwag at his studio in Los Angeles, California.

A single lower-quadrant wigwag in the industrial city of Vernon, California, once protected a crossing on 49th Street with eight separate tracks on the BNSF Harbor Subdivision. A link between downtown Los Angeles and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, this line currently sees less traffic since the completion of the more direct Alameda Corridor between downtown and the harbor. This project eliminated many at-grade crossings along Alameda Street and a number of Southern Pacific wigwags remaining from the PE era. Those remaining protect crossings of lightly used spur lines primarily in California and Wisconsin, the latter state featuring a different signal produced by Bryant-Zinc purchased by the Railroad Supply Company, which later became the Western Railroad Supply Company (WRRS).

The signal was removed sometime in late April 2020. Its removal and that of the Anaheim signal the previous year marked the end of Southern California wigwags still in revenue service.

Wigwags manufactured by WRRS and its predecessors were once numerous in the Midwest, with almost every town using them to protect their main crossings. The most common model was called the Autoflag #5. They functioned in much the same way as the Magnetic Flagmen. They utilized alternating electromagnets to swing a shaft with an attached illuminated banner. Bells were not integral to the devices as with the Magnetic Flagmen. They employed standard bells that were used on other types of signals, and mounted either to the mast or to a bracket on the top of the center harp style, as in the Devil&#x27;s Lake, WI photo.
Autoflag #5s were widely used on the Chicago &amp; North Western (C&amp;NW), Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy (CB&amp;Q), Illinois Central, Soo Line and the Milwaukee Road Railroads. A few were also used on the Louisville &amp; Nashville and the Gulf, Mobile &amp; Ohio (GM&amp;O) as well as other roads in the US and Canada. Most of these wigwags were removed in the 1970-1980s as crossings were updated. They were made in both a lower quadrant style and a center harp style similar to the Magnetic Flagman&#x27;s peachbasket style. Early on, there were Autoflag #5s that would hold the banner behind a shield much like the Magnetic Flagman disappearing banner-style. These were replaced as time went on with the standard two-position banner that hung vertically when not energized. Several railroad, such as the GM&amp;O and CB&amp;Q, had a second light below the main light on the banner. This served as a second reserve light in case of failure of both bulbs in the main light and as a signal maintainers&#x27; warning of a burned-out bulb without having to climb up and open the main light to check each bulb. If the secondary light was illuminated, there was an issue with burned out bulbs in the main light.

Wigwags were also manufactured by Union Switch and Signal (US&amp;S). They were primarily used in the northeastern US, with a few in Florida, although the Frisco had some in the Great Plains. An example was also pictured in a review of Hawaiian sugar cane railroads from the 1940s. They were manufactured in both a disappearing banner style in the East and standard two-position in the Great Plains. While there are a few examples in museums, the sole surviving US&amp;S wigwag in service in the US is a two-position style in Joplin, MO on an ex-Frisco industrial spur. It was not destroyed in the May, 2011 Joplin tornado, being a few blocks outside the damage path. These were a bit different in design from the Autoflag #5 and the Magnetic Flagman. The swing of the banner was produced through a drive shaft. Some of them, particularly on the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, had chase lights mounted above the banner that simulated the movement of the banner. The last one of this type with the chase lights was removed in 1985 and US&amp;S wigwags were thought to have disappeared from the USA until the discovery of the specimen in Joplin. There are a number of US&amp;S wigwags that have been preserved and restored by museums.

US&amp;S and WRRS wigwags were also used by the CPR on its Canadian lines. There were two wig-wags in service in Canada, located on the CN CASO sub near Tilbury, Ontario. Both were WRRS Autoflag #5s with disappearing banners. Disappearing banners were the only style of wigwag approved for use in Canada. They were slated to be removed in early 2009, although they were still in place as of November 2009. In 2011, the CASO sub was abandoned and the wigwags were removed.
The wigwags at the crossing that mark the location of the western terminus of the BNSF Railway (successor to the Santa Fe) on West Richmond Avenue in Point Richmond, CA became pawns in a fight over local control in 2001 when BNSF said it was going to remove them once they installed more modern devices, after the state&#x27;s transportation authority pressured it to upgrade the crossing. Nevertheless, in July 2019 the two upper wig wags were put operative again after the Richmond community raised funds ($2,000) to restore the devices, which had been out of use for 18 years. The two upper-quadrant wigwags are the last of their kind paired together in active use. Both wigwags remain as non-operative decorations at the crossing, coexisting with the modern gates, red lights and bells. In the interest of safety, information signs were posted at the wigwags stating that the wigwags are non-operational. The ability to be activated by trains was retained, but only for special events.

On the episode of &quot;American Restoration&quot; aired on April 16, 2013, a pair of WRRS Autoflag #5 wigwag signals were restored for the Nevada Northern Railway Museum in Ely, Nevada.

In Australia, a wigwag is left preserved along the abandoned Victor Harbor railway line in Mount Barker, South Australia. 
In the Netherlands there was one wigwag; at a portal on the Damlaan in Leidschendam (the famous blue tramway line)(1924-1961)
There are at least 5 wigwags left in Chile; one in Padre Hurtado, one outside San Felipe, and three in Llaillay. Unknown if they are in use. There have also been some in France, Italy, and Switzerland.

<text>Kill and Kill Again is a 1981 action film directed by Ivan Hall. The film stars James Ryan as Steve Chase who is hired to save the scientist Horatio Kane, who has been kidnapped by the villain Marduk. Chase gathers together a team of mercenaries who find their way to the villain&#x27;s stronghold and then find themselves fighting for their lives as they are captured.

&quot;Kill and Kill Again&quot; is a sequel to the film &quot;Kill or Be Killed&quot; and began filming in June 1980. The film was shot in Europe and the United States with the cast predominantly being from South Africa. It was released in New York on May 8, 1981. It received negative reviews from &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; who found the film &quot;unexciting&quot; and with a &quot;horrible plot&quot;, respectively.

==Plot==
Martial arts champion Steve Chase is hired by Kandy Kane to rescue her father, Dr. Horatio Kane, who had accidentally discovered a mind-control drug while researching potatoes as an energy source. The government offers Steve $2 million to find him, but he gets $5 million and is allowed to select his own team. He recruits four of his old friends: a mystic known as the Fly, a reclusive former martial arts champ named Gypsy Billy, a large former wrestler named Gorilla, and a goofy cheerful fellow called Hot Dog.

The government officials brief them on their mission: Wellington Forsyth III, a billionaire who supposedly disappeared years ago, now calls himself Marduk (MAR-dook); they believe he kidnapped Kane for his mind-control drug to create an army with the intention of totalitarianism. Having seized control of a town called Ironville, Marduk is now a warlord with many followers under his control from Kane&#x27;s drug (which has to be re-administered when it wears off). They want Steve and his team to stop Marduk&#x27;s plans and rescue Kane. When Kandy insists on joining them, Steve eventually relents when she reveals that she too can fight.

In his fortress, Marduk seeks a challenger for his undefeated champion, the Optimus, a large man who fights with raw power. Steve and his group wrangle their way into Ironville only to be captured by Marduk&#x27;s guards, and are each forced to fight members of his army. They all best their respective opponents, including Steve who defeats the Optimus. Marduk then forces Steve to drink a new serum and orders him to kill his friends, but the serum fails (Steve having received an antidote to the drug in advance from Dr. Kane, who had been concealing the fact of his own resistance from Marduk) and Steve forces Marduk to declare everyone free and destroy him instead. Chaos erupts, and Steve eventually saves Kane from being shot by Marduk&#x27;s top guard. Marduk tries to escape via helicopter, but cannot take off with Gorilla holding one of the rotors. The remaining guards open fire on Gorilla, but end up hitting the helicopter, which explodes with Marduk still on board.

Kandy later reveals that she was actually an undercover government agent, and the real Kandy Kane, formerly under Marduk&#x27;s control, has been reunited with her father, who decides to stay behind to give his antidote to everyone else affected, and the heroes head for home.

==Cast==
==Production==
In an article on February 11, 1980, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; stated that Film Ventures International would produce a sequel to the film &quot;Kill or Be Killed&quot; titled &quot;Kill or Be Killed, Part II&quot; to be scheduled to start filming in June 1980. The film was being referred to &quot;Kill or Be Killed II&quot; by July 24, 1980 in the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; and later referred to as &quot;Kill and Kill Again&quot; in a November 4, 1980 article of the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

The cast of the film was predominantly from South Africa. &quot;Variety&quot; reported on September 24, 1980 that Diane Newman had been cast in the film, but she does not appear in the film&#x27;s credits. Filming ended in the United States on July 24, 1980 and was set to move to locations in Europe.

==Release==
&quot;Kill and Kill Again&quot; was released in New York on May 8, 1981. On August 12, 1980, the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that a third film in the series was planned. As of December 2013, no follow-up film has gone into production.

==Proposed Third Film==
During his commentary on the Blu-Ray edition of &quot;Kill and Kill Again&quot;, James Ryan gave full details on the proposed third film of the franchise. The film was to be titled &quot;Most Dangerous Man&quot; and would feature Ryan returning as Steve Chase as now a secret agent. The film was to be in a James Bond-manner with karate sequences. He even said that a female lead was chosen in the form of a young Sharon Stone. However, the collapse of Film Ventures International ended up derailing the plans for the film and Ryan returned full-time to South Africa.

==Reception==
From contemporary reviews, &quot;Variety&quot;″s &quot;Lor.&quot; found that the fight scenes were &quot;unexciting&quot;, as the &quot;choreography is too pat and lacks danger.&quot; while concluding the film to be a &quot;good-natured karate actioner for genre fans&quot;
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated the film had a &quot;horrible plot&quot; that &quot;contains a lot of action, but most of the violence is in the grunting and groaning that accompanies the various karate chops.&quot;

<text>A law degree is an academic degree conferred for studies in law. 

Some law degrees are professional degrees that are prerequisites or serve as preparation for legal careers. These generally include the Bachelor of Civil Law, Bachelor of Laws, and Juris Doctor. Law degrees that are not part of a professional pathway to legal practice include the Master of Laws (LLM) and Doctor of Laws (LLD or JSD). 

These degrees are usually obtained through a combination of coursework, research, and practical experiences, such as internships or clinical legal education. Law degrees are recognized as a necessary step towards becoming a licensed lawyer in many jurisdictions, and they also provide a foundation for various other career paths such as academia, policy, or consultancy.

== List of common degrees ==

* Bachelor of Laws (LLB)
* Master of Laws (LLM)
* Doctor of Laws (LLD)
* Juris Doctor (JD)
* Doctor of Juridical Science (SJD)
* Master of Studies in Law (MSL)

==History==
The first academic degrees were law degrees, and the first law degrees were doctorates. The foundations of the first universities in Europe were the glossators of the 11th century, which were schools of law. The first European university, Bologna, was founded by four legal scholars in the 12th century. The first academic title of &quot;doctor&quot; applied to scholars of law. The degree and title were not applied to scholars of other disciplines until the 13th century. 

The University of Bologna served as the model for other law schools of the medieval age. While it was common for students of law to visit and study at schools in other countries, that was not the case with England. This was because of the English rejection of Roman law. Although the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge did teach canon law up until the English Reformation, its importance was always superior to civil law in those institutions.

=== Types of degrees ===
The type of law degree conferred differs according to the jurisdiction. 

=== Austria ===

&quot;Magister iuris (Mag. iur.)&quot; (&quot;Master of Law&quot;) in Austria. It is a master&#x27;s level degree and the first academic title within both systems. After three years of practice, students can take the &quot;Anwaltsprüfung,&quot; an equivalent of the bar exam.

=== Brazil ===

&quot;Bacharel em Direito&quot; (Bachelor of Laws) or &quot;Bacharel em Ciências Jurídicas e Sociais&quot; (Bachelor of Laws and Social Sciences), in Brazil. It is an undergraduate degree. To be a lawyer and be admitted at the Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil (Brazilian Bar Association), the Bachelor must be approved at the Brazilian Bar Exam. If the Selection and Registration Committee accept the new member, they will be considered an Advogado (Attorney at Law/Advocate).

=== Canada ===

Canada&#x27;s legal system is composed of both common law and civil law elements. As of 2019, the professional degree required to become a common law lawyer is a &quot;Juris Doctor&quot; (J.D.). Formerly, this degree was called a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B., &quot;Legum Baccalaureatus&quot; in Latin), but the name was phased out. LL.B. holders were often given the chance to convert their degrees to the new designation. Despite having the word &quot;Doctor&quot; in the name, the J.D. remains a second-entry undergraduate programme, requiring some years of undergraduate study before applicants are eligible. For Quebec, where provincial law is a hybrid of French-heritage civil law for civil matters and common law for public, criminal, and federal law matters, the professional degree is often called the Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) in English, and has other designations at various institutions in Quebec. Prior to getting called to the bar in one of Canada&#x27;s provinces or territories, degree-holders must complete bar exams and articling terms (professional apprenticeships with practising lawyers) or the equivalent thereof.

For graduate academic study in law, the master&#x27;s level designation is the Master of Laws (LL.M., &quot;Legum Magister&quot; in Latin). Doctoral-level legal research degrees vary in title by institution, but the designations include the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D., &quot;Scientiae Juridicae Doctor&quot; in Latin), Doctor of Philosophy in Law (Ph.D., &quot;Philosophiae Doctor&quot; in Latin), or Doctor of Laws (LL.D., &quot;Legum Doctor&quot; in Latin) for common law-based doctorates and the Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) for civil law-based doctorates.

The degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D., &quot;Legum Doctor&quot; in Latin) is reserved at some universities for honorary use.

=== Croatia ===

&quot;Magister iuris (Mag. iur.)&quot; (&quot;Master of Law&quot;) in Croatia. It is a master&#x27;s level degree and the first academic title within the system. After three years of practice, students can take the &quot;Pravosudni ispit,&quot; an equivalent of the bar exam.

===Finland===
Having a Master&#x27;s degree in law is the basic qualification for the legal profession.

=== Germany ===

&quot;Erstes Juristisches Staatsexamen&quot; is partially equivalent to the Bar exam, since the second part &quot;(Zweites Juristisches Staatsexamen),&quot; is the German equivalent to the Bar exam in the U.S. At some universities you either become a &quot;Lizentiat des Rechts (Licentiatus iuris)&quot;, a &quot;Magister iuris,&quot; or a &quot;Diplom-Jurist&quot;. It is a master&#x27;s-level degree.

=== Italy ===

&quot;Laurea di Dottore in Giurisprudenza&quot; for graduates before the Bologna Process reforms, or &quot;Laurea Magistrale in Giurisprudenza&quot; after the Bologna Process reforms (&quot;Juris Doctor&quot;), in Italy. It is a masters level degree, however all graduates of Italian universities are authorized to use the title of &quot;dottore&quot; (Italian for doctor).

===Mexico===

&quot;Licenciatura en Derecho&quot; (&quot;Bachelor in Law&quot;) in Mexico.

=== Russia ===

In Russia, students attend university to earn a Specialist degree in law. A Russian law degree is graduate-level degree, which allows for PhD research after admission to the PhD department (aspirantura), though formally it is not at the master&#x27;s level.

=== Spain ===

Spanish universities confer a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Law. At one time, students earned law degrees as a part of the five-year Bologna Process. The modern Spanish law program consists of four years, with internship and to specialize and it has a graduate level (it is necessary to study a master&#x27;s degree).

=== Switzerland ===

&quot;Lizentiat der Rechtswissenschaften&quot; (German) / &quot;Licence en droit&quot; (French) until 2004 and &quot;Master of Law (MLaw)&quot; since 2004 (as a result of the Bologna Process) in Switzerland. It is a masters level degree.

===Ukraine===

Since 2017 the main degree in law in Ukraine is a &quot;Master of Laws&quot; degree (&quot;mahistr prava&quot;, 1.5 or 2 years of study after obtaining a Bachelor of Laws degree). 

It may be obtained only after obtaining a &quot;Bachelor of Laws&quot; degree (&quot;bakalavr prava&quot;, 4 years of study after graduation from high school).

Until 2017 Ukrainian universities also conferred a &quot;Specialist in Law&quot; degrees (&quot;spetsialist prava&quot; or &quot;iuryst&quot;). Until 2002 it required 5 years of study after graduation from high school (according to the system of education inherited from the Soviet era). In 2002–2017, a Specialist in Law degree existed alongside the Master of Laws; in these years Specialist in Law programs lasted 1 year after obtaining Bachelor of Laws degree). In 2016, students were enrolled on the specialist&#x27;s programs for the last time.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===

Universities in the United Kingdom generally award a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) for undergraduate legal studies, although some award a Bachelor of Arts as their standard undergraduate law degree, as with the B.A. in jurisprudence at the University of Oxford and the B.A. Tripos in Law at the University of Cambridge. The Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) degree awarded by the University of Oxford is in fact a postgraduate degree, similar to an LL.M. elsewhere.

In the Republic of Ireland, undergraduate law degrees are offered in the same fashion as in the United Kingdom. While the constituent universities of the National University of Ireland award a Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) degree as their primary undergraduate law degree, it is in fact a common law degree that is directly equivalent to an LL.B. degree elsewhere. The Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree is the degree generally awarded by other universities and colleges in Ireland.

Many universities also offer a Master of Laws. Also referred to as an LL.M. from its Latin name, Legum Magister. It is an advanced academic degree pursued by those holding a professional law degree or a degree in a relevant field.

===Others===

&quot;Juris Doctor&quot; (J.D.) in the United States and Japan (also offered at some schools in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Hong Kong). It is a professional degree.

&quot;Legum Doctor&quot; (known as the LL.D., or in some jurisdictions Doctor of Laws) is in some jurisdictions the highest academic degree in law and is equivalent to a Ph.D., and in others is an honorary degree only.

&quot;Doctor of Juridical Science&quot; (S.J.D.) is a research doctorate in law awarded mostly in the United States and Canada.

<text>Liberty! The Saga of Sycamore Shoals, formerly known as The Wataugans, is an outdoor historical drama that takes place in Elizabethton, Tennessee, at the Sycamore Shoals Historic Area. Designated the official outdoor drama of the state of Tennessee, it is presented by the Friends of Sycamore Shoals every June each night of the first four weekends (Fri-Sat the first two weeks and Thurs-Sat the second two weeks). Employing a mixed cast of volunteering professional and amateur local actors and re-enactors engaged through an open casting call, Liberty depicts the early history of the area that is now northeast Tennessee.

== Plot ==

===Act I===
The early settlers along the Holston and Watauga Rivers in modern East Tennessee find themselves outside the jurisdiction of North Carolina and Virginia, and, in 1772, form a government of their own, the Watauga Association, described by such historians as Theodore Roosevelt as the first free and independent government (at least by men of European descent) on the American continent. At the time, it was regarded by John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, royal governor of Virginia, as an attempt to set up a &#x27;Separate State,&#x27; which made it &#x27;a dangerous example&#x27; to other disaffected colonists.

In 1775, Judge Richard Henderson&#x27;s Transylvania Purchase, buying most of modern Kentucky and Middle Tennessee from the Cherokee Indians is opposed by the young warrior Dragging Canoe. He and his followers also oppose the purchase by the Watauga Association of the land they currently occupy. Although most of the older chiefs, including Dragging Canoe&#x27;s father Atta-culla-culla, favour peace with the white settlers, the younger warriors attack the settlements in the area, bringing the act to a climax with the 1776 attack on the reproduction of Fort Watauga (more properly known as Fort Caswell) that has stood in the park since the 1970s. In the battle, John Sevier, who would later be the only governor of the State of Franklin and the first governor of the State of Tennessee, meets his second wife, the high-spirited and athletic Catherine Sherrill, pulling her over the wall of the fort after her running leap made while fleeing from the Cherokees.

Act I concludes with the breaking of the siege and news of the Declaration of Independence.

===Act II===
The 1780 wedding of John Sevier and &#x27;Bonnie Kate&#x27; Sherrill is interrupted by a messenger with news of the war being fought against the British on the other side of the Appalachian Mountains. Major Patrick Ferguson, a British officer assigned to lead American Loyalist Militia in pacifying the rebellion in the west, has threatened to march over the mountains, hang the leaders, and lay waste to the country with fire and sword. Local leaders attending the wedding agree to muster the local militia on September 25, 1780, and march over the mountains to meet Ferguson before he can endanger their families. The ensuing march, culminating in the Battle of Kings Mountain, earned the participants the nickname &quot;Overmountain Men,&quot; and their victory over the British is sometimes referred to as the turning point of the American Revolution in the South.

The drama depicts the battle in the distance on a small hill beside the fort that serves as a backdrop for the entire performance. The distant battle is accompanied by narration and exciting (yet loud) fireworks and gunfire.

During the absence of the militia, the women of the settlement and the few remaining men (one out of seven were drafted to stay behind) defend themselves from the Cherokee and British Indian agents.

The drama concludes with the return of the Overmountain Men and a brief narration of the later accomplishments of some of their more prominent members, like Landon Carter.

== History ==
Due to legal problems, &quot;The Wataugans&quot; was rewritten, and obtained a new name. After the change, the drama was performed in Nashville for one weekend.

For its twenty ninth Season, 2007, the title &quot;The Wataugans&quot; was changed to &quot;Liberty! The Saga of Sycamore Shoals.&quot; The Watauga Historical Association is no longer in existence, replaced as the primary backer for the play by the Friends of Sycamore Shoals State Historic Park.

&quot;Liberty!&quot; was made Tennessee&#x27;s official outdoor drama by the Tennessee General Assembly in 2009.

<doc id="534416" wikidata="Q45784" url="?curid=534416" title="Wozzeck">
<text>Wozzeck () is the first opera by the Austrian composer Alban Berg. Composed between 1914 and 1922, it premiered in 1925. It is based on the drama &quot;Woyzeck&quot;, which German playwright Georg Büchner left incomplete at his death. Berg attended the first production in Vienna of Büchner&#x27;s play on 5 May 1914, and knew at once that he wanted to base an opera on it. (At the time, the play was still known as &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, due to an incorrect transcription by Karl Emil Franzos, who was working from a barely-legible manuscript; the correct title would not emerge until 1921.) From the fragments of unordered scenes left by Büchner, Berg selected 15 to form a compact structure of three acts with five scenes each. He adapted the libretto himself, retaining &quot;the essential character of the play, with its many short scenes, its abrupt and sometimes brutal language, and its stark, if haunted, realism...&quot;

The plot depicts the everyday lives of soldiers and the townspeople of a rural German-speaking town. Prominent themes of militarism, callousness, social exploitation, and casual are brutally and uncompromisingly presented. Toward the end of act 1, scene 2, the title character (Wozzeck) murmurs, &quot;Still, all is still, as if the world died,&quot; with his fellow soldier Andres muttering, &quot;Night! We must get back!&quot; seemingly oblivious to Wozzeck&#x27;s words. A funeral march begins, only to transform into the upbeat song of the military marching band in the next scene. Musicologist Glenn Watkins considers this &quot;as vivid a projection of impending world doom as any to come out of the Great War&quot;.

==Historical background==
Berg began writing &quot;Wozzeck&quot; in 1914, shortly before World War I began and delayed his work. He was never stationed on the front line and sought the rank of (), which he obtained in 1916, for its shorter term of service. His pained determination to complete the opera is documented in letters and notebooks. He wrote his wife , &quot;For months I haven&#x27;t done any work on &quot;Wozzeck&quot;. Everything suffocated. Buried!&quot;

Berg had more time to work on regiment leave (1917–1918). Much of the opera was composed at the piano in Helene&#x27;s Trahütten family cottage during . He nurtured his creativity there by reading books, walking through the forests, collecting mushrooms, and admiring the mountains, lakes, and springs—habits of a &quot;love of nature&quot; that Helene identified in Berg&#x27;s music, including that of &quot;Wozzeck&quot;.

Berg&#x27;s experience of the war shaped the opera in many ways. News of the ongoing war troubled him. He wrote Schoenberg of a reportedly &quot;&#x27;successful&#x27; ruse&quot; in which the sound of a bell, perhaps reminding soldiers of a &quot;past time&quot; or &quot;beloved place&quot;, was used to bait and kill them: Berg also wrote Helene in 1918 that he identified with Wozzeck: The war also separated Berg from Schoenberg and their social circles in Vienna, affording him not only solitude, but also independence despite the trying and unusual circumstances. He finished act 1 by summer 1919, act 2 in August 1921, and act 3 over the next two months. Finalizing orchestration over the following six months, he completed &quot;Wozzeck&quot; in April 1922.

==Drama==

===Roles===

===Synopsis===

====Act 1====
&quot;Scene 1 (Suite)&quot;

Wozzeck shaves the Captain, who lectures him on the qualities of a &quot;decent man&quot; and taunts him for living an immoral life. Wozzeck dutifully replies, (&quot;Yes sir, Captain&quot;) to these repeated insults. When the Captain scorns Wozzeck&#x27;s having a child &quot;without the blessing of the Church&quot;, Wozzeck argues that poverty makes virtue difficult and quotes Mark 10:14, (&quot;Allow the little children to come to me&quot;). Confused, the Captain asks for clarification. Wozzeck grows agitated as he explains, crying out that if the poor ever &quot;got to Heaven, we&#x27;d all have to manufacture thunder!&quot; to tumultuous, crackling music. The Captain abruptly tries to calm Wozzeck, conceding that he is &quot;a decent man, only you think too much!&quot; The tired Captain exits.

&quot;Scene 2 (Rhapsody and Hunting Song)&quot;
Wozzeck and Andres cut sticks at sunset. Andres sings a hunting song. Wozzeck experiences frightening visions and grows agitated. Andres tries to calm him.

&quot;Scene 3 (March and Lullaby)&quot;

Marie admires a military parade when Margret mocks her for her interest in the soldiers. Marie shuts the window. She sings a self-soothing lullaby to her son. Wozzeck arrives, sharing his troubling visions. He leaves without even seeing their child, much to Marie&#x27;s dismay. She laments their poverty.

&quot;Scene 4 (Passacaglia)&quot;

The Doctor scolds Wozzeck for not following his strict orders, involving a restrictive diet and urine collection. He is delighted when Wozzeck&#x27;s mental illness becomes apparent.

&quot;Scene 5 (Rondo)&quot;

Marie admires the Drum Major from her doorway. He makes advances, which she first rejects but then accepts after a short struggle.

====Act 2====
&quot;Scene 1 (Sonata-Allegro)&quot;

Marie admires her earrings, a gift from the Drum Major. She bids her son to sleep. Wozzeck arrives, startling her. He asks about the earrings, and she claims she found them. He doubts that, but gives her money and leaves. Marie is wracked with guilt.

&quot;Scene 2 (Fantasia and Fugue on Three Themes)&quot;

Echoing the opening scene, the Captain urges the Doctor to slow down as they pass. The Doctor taunts the Captain with a list of frightening diagnoses for his ailments. As Wozzeck passes, they hint that Marie is unfaithful to him.

&quot;Scene 3 (Largo)&quot;

Wozzeck confronts Marie. She does not deny it. Enraged, he nearly strikes her. She stops him. &quot;Better a knife in my belly than your hands on me,&quot; she says. Wozzeck repeats this after her, considering it.

&quot;Scene 4 (Scherzo)&quot;

Wozzeck spots Marie out dancing with the Drum Major. While soldiers sing a hunter&#x27;s chorus, Andres notices Wozzeck sitting alone and asks why. An Apprentice is drunkenly preaching when an Idiot stumbles toward Wozzeck, crying, (&quot;Joyful, ... but it reeks ... I smell blood!&quot;)

&quot;Scene 5 (Rondo)&quot;

In the barracks at night, Wozzeck cannot sleep without thinking about Marie, disturbing Andres. Wozzeck prays while everyone snores. The Drum Major enters and beats Wozzeck, who is humiliated. Some watch. Wozzeck dissociates.

====Act 3====
&quot;Scene 1 (Invention on a Theme)&quot;

In her room at night, Marie reads from the Bible, crying out for mercy.

&quot;Scene 2 (Invention on a Single Note (B))&quot;

Wozzeck and Marie walk along a pond in the forest. Wozzeck grabs her when she tries to flee. He stabs her, declaring that if he can&#x27;t have her, no one else can. A blood-red moon rises.

&quot;Scene 3 (Invention on a Rhythm)&quot;

In a tavern, Wozzeck dances with Margret. He pulls her onto his lap, insults her, and demands that she sing. As she does, people notice blood on Wozzeck. They raise alarm. Agitated and terrified, Wozzeck flees.

&quot;Scene 4 (Invention on a Hexachord)&quot;

Wozzeck tries to retrieve the knife from the pond. Hallucinating, he speaks to Marie. He has paranoid delusions about the blood-red moon telling the world about his crime. He becomes frantic and drowns in what he imagines is blood. Nearby, the Captain and Doctor are enjoying a slow walk. They shudder at the sound of someone drowning and quickly leave.

&quot;Interlude (Invention on a Key (D minor))&quot;

This interlude leads to the finale.

&quot;Scene 5 (Invention on an Eighth-Note moto perpetuo, &quot;quasi toccata)&quot; &quot;

The next morning, children play and sing in the sunny street outside Marie&#x27;s door. News spreads that she is dead. They all run off to see the body. Marie&#x27;s son is unaffected by the news, even after it is shouted at him. After some delay, he follows the others, oblivious.

==Music==

A typical performance of the work takes slightly over an hour and a half.

===Instrumentation===
&quot;Wozzeck&quot; uses a fairly large orchestra and has three onstage ensembles in addition to the pit orchestra (a marching band in act 1, scene 3; a chamber orchestra in act 2, scene 3; and a tavern band in act 2, scene 4; an upright piano is also played in act 3, scene 3). The instrumentation is:

====Pit orchestra====

;Woodwinds
: 4 flutes (all double piccolos)
: 4 oboes (4th doubles English horn)
: 1 bass clarinet in B
: 3 bassoons
: 1 contrabassoon

;Brass:
: 4 horns in F
: 4 trumpets in F
: 4 trombones (1 alto, 2 tenor, 1 bass)
: 1 tuba

;Percussion:
: 4 timpani
: 2 bass drums (one with rute)
: snare drum
: 2 tam-tams (one smaller than the other)
: triangle
: xylophone

;Keyboards:
: celesta

;Strings:
: harp
: violins I and II
: violas
: cellos
: double basses
====Special groups====

Marching band (act 1, scene 3):

;Woodwinds:
: 1 piccolo
: 2 flutes
: 2 oboes
: 2 clarinets in E
: 2 bassoons

;Brass:
: 2 horns in F
: 2 trumpets in F
: 3 trombones
: 1 tuba

;Percussion:
: bass drum with cymbals
: snare drum
: triangle
Berg notes that marching band members may be taken from the pit orchestra, indicating exactly where the players can leave with a footnote near the end of act 1, scene 2.

Tavern band (act 2, scene 4):

;Woodwinds:
: 1 clarinet in C

;Brass:
: 1 bombardon in F (or tuba, if it can be muted)

;Keyboard:
: accordion

;Strings:
: guitar
: 2 fiddles (violins with steel strings)
In addition, for the Tavern scene in act 3, scene 3, Berg calls for an out-of-tune upright piano.

Chamber orchestra (act 2, scene 3):

;Woodwinds:
: 1 flute (doubling piccolo)
: 1 oboe,
: 1 English horn
: 1 clarinet in E
: 1 clarinet in A
: 1 bass clarinet in B
: 1 bassoon
: 1 contrabassoon

;Brass:
: 2 horns

;Strings:
: 2 violins
: 1 viola
: 1 violoncello
: 1 double bass
The instrumentation matches that of Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Chamber Symphony No. 1&quot;.

===Classic forms===
Berg decided not to use classic operatic forms such as aria or trio. Instead, each scene is given its own inner coherence by the use of forms more commonly associated with abstract instrumental music. The second scene of act 2 (during which the Doctor and Captain taunt Wozzeck about Marie&#x27;s infidelity), for instance, consists of a prelude and triple fugue. The fourth scene of act 1, focusing on Wozzeck and the Doctor, is a passacaglia.

The scenes of the third act move beyond these structures and adopt novel strategies. Each scene is a set of variations, but not necessarily on a melody. Thus, scene two is a variation on a single note, B, which is heard continuously in the scene, and the only note heard in the powerful orchestral crescendos at the end of act 3, scene 2. Scene 3 is a variation on a rhythmic pattern, with every major thematic element constructed around this pattern. Scene 4 is a variation on a chord, used exclusively for the whole scene. The following orchestral interlude is a freely composed passage firmly grounded in D minor. Finally, the last scene is a &quot;moto perpetuo&quot;, a variation on a single rhythm (the quaver).

The table below summarizes the dramatic action and forms as prepared by Fritz Mahler.

===Leitmotifs===
The opera uses a variety of musical techniques to create unity and coherence. The first is leitmotifs. As with most examples of this method, each leitmotif is used in a much subtler manner than being directly attached to a character or object. Still, motifs for the Captain, the Doctor and the Drum Major are very prominent. Wozzeck is clearly associated with two motifs, one often heard as he rushes on or off stage, the other more languidly expressing his misery and helplessness in the face of the pressures he experiences. Marie is accompanied by motifs that express her sensuality, as when she accepts a pair of earrings from the Drum Major. A motif not linked to a physical object is the pair of chords that close each act, used in an oscillating repetition until they almost blur into one another.

The most significant is the &quot;anguish&quot; motif first sung by Wozzeck in the first scene with the Captain, to the words (&quot;we poor folks&quot;). Tracing out a minor chord with added major seventh, it is frequently heard as the signal of the characters&#x27; inability to transcend their situation.

Berg also reuses motifs from set pieces heard earlier in the opera to give insight into characters&#x27; thoughts. For example, the reappearance of military band music in the last scene of act 1 informs the audience that Marie is musing on the Drum Major&#x27;s attractiveness.

An almost imperceptible leitmotif is the single pitch B, symbolizing the murder. It is first heard at the very end of act 2, after Wozzeck&#x27;s humiliation, after his words &quot;&quot; (&quot;one after another&quot;), and grows increasingly insistent during the murder scene, with Marie&#x27;s last cry for help a two-octave jump from B5 to B3, until after the murder, when the whole orchestra explodes through a prolonged crescendo on this note, first in unison on B3, then spread across the whole range of the orchestra in octaves.

===Expressionism and other elements===
Berg&#x27;s expressionist music emphasized Wozzeck&#x27;s and other characters&#x27; emotions and thought processes, particularly Wozzeck&#x27;s madness and alienation. Though atonal, it was not always without conventional function in its voice leading, extended tonicizations, or arguably tonal passages. He used pitch and harmony among elements of the music&#x27;s formal structure to portray the drama. Some pitch sets recur at crucial moments, establishing continuity and contributing to coherence. B–F tritonal dyads represent Wozzeck and Marie, tense and struggling. B–D minor-third dyads represent Marie&#x27;s bond with her child.

Berg adapted some of his tonal juvenilia for use in &quot;Wozzeck&quot;. In Marie&#x27;s Bible scene, he reworked an early sonata fragment in F minor, which Christopher Hailey described as Schumannesque in its abiding melancholy. In an interlude adapted from a Mahlerian student piece in D minor, Berg brings the opera to a climax with a dominant-functioning aggregate sonority marked , which crescendos into a potent statement of the &quot;anguish&quot; leitmotif (act 3, mm. 364–365). The dramatic effect is cathartic after Wozzeck&#x27;s final mad scene Then Wozzeck&#x27;s and Marie&#x27;s unnamed orphan son plays among children singing in a brief epilogue. They are interrupted by the news that a peer shouts at him: 

Berg&#x27;s notes and sketches for &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (and for the March from his Three Orchestral Pieces, 1913–1915) were mingled with disjointed fragments of military ordinances and terminology. In a draft page of the act 1, scene 2 libretto, he sketched Austrian army bugle calls. He modified them in the final score, where they appeared in a recognizably atonal form. He also included modified folk elements, particularly in the open field and tavern scenes. Berg&#x27;s war experience also informed his word painting of snoring soldiers in barracks (act 2, scene 5): &quot;this polyphonic breathing, gasping, and groaning is the most peculiar chorus I&#x27;ve ever heard. It is like some primeval music that wells up from the abysses of the soul&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Wozzeck&quot; is one of the most famous 20th-century modernist operas. John Deathridge called it &quot;one of the undisputed masterpieces of modern opera&quot;. It has also been compared to Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Erwartung&quot; in its dissonant, psychological idiom. The inner turmoil and self-destructive trajectory of its outcast antihero has also prompted comparison to other major operas with similar male title roles, including Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Nabucco&quot;, Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, and Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;.

===Cultural context===
&quot;Wozzeck&quot; comes from the same expressionist milieu, with its origins in symbolism, as novelist Franz Kafka, painters Oskar Kokoschka and Emil Nolde, and poets Gottfried Benn, Rainier Maria Rilke, and Franz Werfel. In German opera, Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Elektra&quot; is an early example, followed by Schoenberg&#x27;s more radical &quot;Erwartung&quot; and &quot;Die glückliche Hand&quot;. Among the operas premiered within a year of &quot;Wozzeck&quot; were Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Cardillac&quot;, Krenek&#x27;s &quot;Zwingburg&quot; and &quot;Sprung&quot;, and Weill&#x27;s &quot;Protagonist&quot;.

Schoenberg and Webern influenced Berg most, but his operas show other influences, David Schroeder suggests, emphasizing Viennese coffee house culture as facilitating Berg&#x27;s early contact with a mix of innovative personalities across disciplines. Among these were more popular composers like Franz Lehár and Oscar Straus, or Erich Korngold and Strauss at establishments like the Café Museum. John L. Stewart suggests that &quot;Wozzeck&quot; was influenced not only by Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Erwartung&quot; but also by Schreker&#x27;s &quot;Der ferne Klang&quot;, the piano-vocal score of which Berg prepared in 1911. Schroeder agrees, cautioning that Berg thought less of Schreker than he did of Mahler, Schoenberg, or himself, and that Schreker&#x27;s operas were more Wagnerian.

====Wagner====
In his 1929 lecture on &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, Berg said he rejected &quot;the Wagnerian recipe of &#x27;through-composing&#x27;&quot; in opting for traditional forms. At the time, this prompted comparisons to Busoni&#x27;s &quot;Doktor Faust&quot; and Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Cardillac&quot;. Deathridge and Hailey wrote that the intense emotional depth of Berg&#x27;s music still linked it to (post-)Wagnerian . Hailey contended that Berg always highlighted this formal approach partly to subvert his reputation for quasi-Romanticism. Werfel, perhaps the Bergs&#x27; closest literary friend, disparaged Wagner&#x27;s &quot;bloated excess&quot; and &quot;garrulous monotony&quot; in favor of Verdi, and may have influenced Berg&#x27;s 1920s opinion of Wagner as &quot;antiquated&quot;.

====Gurlitt====
The much delayed discovery and staging of Büchner&#x27;s incomplete &quot;Woyzeck&quot; inspired not only Berg, but also Manfred Gurlitt. Premiered only four months after Berg&#x27;s, Gurlitt&#x27;s opera was also entitled &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and published by Universal Edition, discomfiting Berg. They worked without any knowledge of one another.

When Berg examined Gurlitt&#x27;s piano-vocal score, he considered it &quot;not bad or unoriginal&quot;, but a weak &quot;broth ... even for (poor folks)&quot;. Hailey agreed, noting its simpler musical textures and describing its polystylism as closer to Hindemith or Weill. Hailey praised Gurlitt&#x27;s more frequent, socially oriented use of chorus, and wrote that Gurlitt&#x27;s approach may have been more faithful to Büchner&#x27;s original conception. Gurlitt&#x27;s work has remained in the shadow of Berg&#x27;s.

===Performance history===
The 1924 Frankfurt premiere of the Three Fragments from &quot;Wozzeck&quot; at the annual festival, along with Webern&#x27;s premiere of the and from the Three Orchestral Pieces during an Austrian Music Week in 1923 Berlin, initiated Berg&#x27;s regional reputation as a considerable figure in music.

Erich Kleiber conducted the world premiere of the entire work at the Berlin State Opera on 14 December 1925, having personally decided on it. Hailey writes that it was &quot;the event of the season&quot;, achieving a noted combination of coherence and expressivity over a substantial length of time despite its post-tonal musical language. Walsh writes that it was a &quot;succès de scandale&quot; with audience disruptions and mixed reaction in the press. Many productions followed throughout Germany and Austria until after 1933, when the Nazis forbade degenerate music.

&quot;Wozzeck&quot; was then taken to Prague by Otakar Ostrčil at the National Theatre in 1926. It provoked a &quot;scandal&quot;, Berg wrote his pupil Theodor W. Adorno, staged by &quot;Czech Nationalists (virtually Nazis)&quot; and &quot;clerical lobbies&quot;. Berg emphasized that this was The Bohemian State Committee forbade further performances. Brian S. Locke called the &quot;&quot;Wozzeck&quot; Affair&quot; the &quot;most important event at the Czechs&#x27; National Theater in the interwar period&quot;.

At its third premiere (1927) in Leningrad, the Association for Contemporary Music and Nikolai Roslavets staged &quot;Wozzeck&quot; at the Mariinsky Theatre with Berg and Shostakovich in attendance. Berg wired Helene, &quot;huge, tumultuous success&quot;, though critical reception was mixed. (Amid Stalinism and deteriorating Germany–Soviet Union relations, &quot;Wozzeck&quot; had yet to be restaged in the Soviet Union, George Perle observed in 1980.)

On 19 March 1931, Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company gave the United States premiere of &quot;Wozzeck&quot; on 19 March at the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia.

Henry Wood and the BBC Symphony Orchestra gave a studio concert of the Three Fragments from &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, which Edward Clark, a pupil of Arnold Schoenberg, produced for broadcast on 13 May 1932. On 14 March 1934, Adrian Boult conducted a complete concert performance of &quot;Wozzeck&quot;, again produced by Edward Clark, in the Queen&#x27;s Hall. (The opera was not staged there until 22 January 1952 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.)

====Effect on Berg====
The success of &quot;Wozzeck&quot; transformed Berg&#x27;s life. It brought him international renown, and he was able to live comfortably off the royalties nearly until his death in 1935. He traveled not only to Germany, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and England, but also to Switzerland, Belgium, Holland, France, and Italy for performances of and talks about the opera.

Busy attending to his newfound success and enjoying financial independence, Berg declined Schreker&#x27;s offers of an appointment at the Berlin Musikhochschule as well as subsequent vacations with Schoenberg, though the two remained committed friends. He benefited from new relationships with Karl Böhm, Erich Kleiber, and Gian Francesco Malipiero, among others, and was appointed to serve on the jury of the ADMV.

===Influence===

====Krenek====
Hans Hartleb saw many parallels between &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and Krenek&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus und Eurydike&quot;. He cited the composers&#x27; use of violent scenes and saw the music of both Eurydike and Marie as evocative of &quot;fatalism, melancholy, and sensuality&quot;. Stewart agrees, writing that Berg&#x27;s music for Marie raised her from a &quot;stock character&quot; to one of more substance. Berg and Krenek knew each other from the salons of Alma Mahler. (Alma was a close friend of the Bergs and the wife or lover of Gustav Mahler, Kokoschka, and Werfel.)

Krenek began studying the piano-vocal score of &quot;Wozzeck&quot; in early 1923, while visiting Kokoschka, the librettist of &quot;Orpheus&quot;. Krenek wrote Berg to praise &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and ask about Berg&#x27;s vocal writing. Berg responded at length, citing (and transcribing) examples from Wagner, Mozart, and Bach to support what he said was his treatment of the human voice as &quot;the supreme instrument&quot;. He said he adapted the music with respect to the voices&#x27; limitations and dramatic function. Berg also used () for dramatic effect. Krenek later said he did not use &quot;Wozzeck&quot; as a model for &quot;Orpheus&quot;, but Stewart suggests that he at least adhered to Berg&#x27;s advice about vocal writing.

====Later music====
In &quot;Sinfonia&quot; (1968–69), Luciano Berio quotes the rising orchestral chords Berg uses in the word painting of Wozzeck&#x27;s drowning.

==Arrangements==
Working with Berg, Erwin Stein made an arrangement of &quot;Wozzeck&quot; for smaller theaters, reducing the orchestra to about 60 players. John Rea&#x27;s arrangement is for 22 singer and 21 instrumental parts.

<text>The Rath Packing Company was a meatpacking company located in Waterloo, Iowa, between 1891 and 1985.

==Background==
George John Rath (variously referred to as George Rath and John George Rath) was born in 1821 in Breitenau, Württemberg province, Germany. He came to the United States in the late 1840s and eventually settled in Dubuque, Iowa. In Dubuque, Rath began a merchant business, making and selling soap and tallow candles. He also began a pork packing operation. By 1873 he had a new partner in both endeavors: His son, E. F. (Edward Frederick) Rath, doing business under the name George Rath and Son.

In February 1891, the Rath&#x27;s small pork packing plant and retail market in Dubuque was destroyed by fire. The fire came at a time when many growing towns in Iowa were trying to attract meat packers to relocate or open operations in their communities. A packing plant was a major acquisition for a small but ambitious town. Such a business meant locally-available fresh meat, employment, and typically created a livestock market, all adding to local commerce and prosperity.

The Raths were approached by the Waterloo, Iowa, Board of Trade (a Chamber of Commerce forerunner) and were eventually won over. Incentives included $10,000 in capital, land for a plant, and tax concessions. At some point during this process, George J. Rath decided not to leave Dubuque and not to continue in the meat packing business, rather to stay with his mercantile business. His son E. F. Rath, and John W. Rath, a cousin from Ackley, Iowa, began the Waterloo venture.

==The Rath Packing Company==
The Rath Packing Company (Rath) of Waterloo (Iowa) opened for business on November 24, 1891, on the Cedar River. Initially, the company concentrated on hogs, but by 1908 the company was also slaughtering beef and soon lamb as well. Business thrived; lucrative contracts to supply meat to the Armed Forces during both World Wars helped the company grow. Growth and profitability were also spurred between the 1930s and 1950s by innovations such as the fancy dry curing of bacon and the vacuum canning of meats. By the company&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary in 1941, the small regional packing house in Waterloo had grown into the nation&#x27;s single largest meatpacking facility with branch facilities in 12 states. By the end of World War II, Rath was the fifth largest meatpacker in the U.S. Through two world wars, stock market panics, depression, and drought, the company had failed to show a profit in only four of its years.

The years following World War II brought labor troubles. A 1948 strike at the Waterloo plant resulted in the death of a striking union member and a riot. Iowa National Guard troops were called in to restore order. Holding firm, Rath management eventually outlasted the union in negotiations, but labor relations remained sour.

==Decline of the company==
The 1960s and 1970s were difficult times for the meat packing industry. Competition was fierce and the industry had become high volume, low margin. Profitability was hurt by a decline in per capita pork consumption beginning in 1960. By the mid 1970s, Rath&#x27;s 50-year-old four-story plant was obsolete. The new model for packing houses called for single-level plants with continually moving automated disassembly lines. In addition, Rath&#x27;s workforce was predominantly middle-aged, older than the industry average for packing houses, and thus burdened with higher than average wage and benefit costs.

In 1980, Local 41 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union which represented most of the labor force, negotiated a plan that, in exchange for wage and benefit concessions from the workers, gave them control of Rath&#x27;s board of directors.

The employee-owned Rath operated at a loss in 1981-1983. After a series of further financial setbacks, Rath ceased operations in December, 1984 and was liquidated in 1985.
==Notable employees==
Boxer and future actor Al Hoosman worked at the plant in the late 1930s.

<text>The least weasel (Mustela nivalis), little weasel, common weasel, or simply weasel is the smallest member of the genus &quot;Mustela,&quot; family Mustelidae and order Carnivora. It is native to Eurasia, North America and North Africa, and has been introduced to New Zealand, Malta, Crete, the Azores, and São Tomé. It is classified as least concern by the IUCN, due to its wide distribution and large population throughout the Northern Hemisphere.

The least weasel varies greatly in size over its range. The body is slender and elongated, and the legs and tail are relatively short. The colour varies geographically, as does the pelage type and length of tail. The dorsal surface, flanks, limbs and tail of the animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white. The line delineating the boundary between the two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and in the northern part of its range, the coat becomes pure white in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.

Small rodents form the largest part of the least weasel&#x27;s diet, but it also kills and eats rabbits, other mammals, and occasionally birds, birds&#x27; eggs, fish and frogs. Males mark their territories with olfactory signals and have exclusive home ranges which may intersect with or include several female ranges. Least weasels use pre-existing holes to sleep, store food and raise their young. Breeding takes place in the spring and summer, and there is a single litter of about six kits which are reared exclusively by the female. Due to its small size and fierce nature, the least weasel plays an important part in the mythology and legend of various cultures.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The least weasel was given its scientific name &quot;Mustela nivalis&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in his 12th edition of Systema Naturae in 1766; its epithet &quot;nivalis&quot; comes from the Latin word &quot;nix&quot; meaning &quot;snow&quot; because it grows a white coat during the winter season. The type locality was Västerbotten in Sweden. As an animal with a very wide distribution, the morphology of the least weasel varies geographically. The species was reviewed by Reichstein in 1957 and again by van Zyll de Jong in 1992 and Reig in 1997. Youngman (1982) placed it in the subgenus &quot;Mustela&quot; while Abramov (1999) considered it should be included in the subgenus &quot;Gale&quot;. Based on skull characteristics, Reig (1997) proposed that the taxon should be split into four species, &quot;M. subpalmata&quot;, &quot;M. rixosa&quot;, &quot;M. vulgaris&quot; and &quot;M. eskimo&quot;. Abrimov and Baryshinikov (2000) disagreed, recognising only &quot;M. subpalmata&quot; (the Egyptian weasel) as a separate species. However, Rodrigues &quot;et al&quot;. (2016) recognized &quot;M. subpalmata&quot; as a distinct population of &quot;nivalis&quot; rather than a distinct species.

Within the genus &quot;Mustela&quot;, the least weasel is a relatively unspecialised form, as evidenced by its pedomorphic skull, which occurs even in large subspecies. Its direct ancestor was &quot;Mustela praenivalis&quot;, which lived in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene and Villafranchian. &quot;M. praenivalis&quot; itself was probably preceded by &quot;M. pliocaenica&quot; of the Pliocene. The modern species probably arose during the Late Pleistocene. The least weasel is the product of a process begun 5–7 million years ago, when northern forests were replaced by open grassland, thus prompting an explosive evolution of small, burrowing rodents. The weasel&#x27;s ancestors were larger than the current form, and underwent a reduction in size to exploit the new food source. The least weasel thrived during the Ice Age, as its small size and long body allowed it to easily operate beneath snow, as well as hunt in burrows. It probably crossed to North America through the Bering land bridge 200,000 years ago.

===Subspecies===
The least weasel has a high geographic variation, a fact which has historically led to numerous disagreements among biologists studying its systematics. The least weasel&#x27;s subspecies are divided into three categories:

* The &quot;pygmaea–rixosa&quot; group (small least weasels): Tiny weasels with short tails, pedomorphic skulls, and pelts that turn pure white in winter. They inhabit northern European Russia, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Finland, the northern Scandinavian Peninsula, Mongolia, northeastern China, Japan and North America.
* The &quot;boccamela&quot; group (large least weasels): Very large weasels with large skulls, relatively long tails and lighter coloured pelts. Locally, they either do not turn white or only partially change colour in winter. They inhabit Transcaucasia, from western Kazakhstan to Semirechye and in the flat deserts of Middle Asia. They are also found in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.
* The &quot;nivalis&quot; group (medium-sized least weasels): Medium-sized weasels, with tails of moderate length, representing a transitional form between the former two groups. They inhabit the middle and southern regions of European Russia, Crimea, the Ciscaucasus, western Kazakhstan, the southern and middle Urals and the montane parts of Middle Asia, except the Kopet Dag.

==Description==

The least weasel has a thin, greatly elongated and extremely flexible body with a small, yet elongated, blunt-muzzled head which is no thicker than the neck. The eyes are small in relation to their head size and are bulging and dark colored. The legs and tail are relatively short, the latter constituting less than half the body length. The feet have sharp, dark-coloured claws, and the soles are heavily haired. The skull, especially that of the small &quot;rixosa&quot; group, has an infantile appearance when compared with that of other members of the genus &quot;Mustela&quot; (in particular, the stoat and kolonok). This is expressed in the relatively large size of the cranium and shortened facial region. The skull is, overall, similar to that of the stoat, but smaller, though the skulls of large male weasels tend to overlap in size with those of small female stoats. There are usually four pairs of nipples but these are only visible in females.

The baculum is short, , with a thick, straight shaft. Fat is deposited along the spine, kidneys, gut mesentries and around the limbs. The least weasel has muscular anal glands under the tail, which measure , and contain sulphurous volatiles, including thietanes and dithiacyclopentanes. The smell and chemical composition of these chemicals are distinct from those of the stoat. The least weasel moves by jumping, the distance between the tracks of the fore and hind limbs being .
Dimensions vary geographically, to an extent rarely found among other mammals. Least weasels of the &quot;boccamela&quot; group, for example, may outweigh the smaller races by almost four times. In some large subspecies, the male may be 1.5 times longer than the female. Variations in tail length are also variable, constituting 13 to 30 percent of the length of the body. Average body length in males is , while females average . The tail measures in males and in females. Males weigh , while females weigh .
The winter fur is dense, but short and closely fitting. In northern subspecies, the fur is soft and silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. There is often a brown spot at the corner of the mouth. The dividing line between the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the tip is a little darker but it is never black. In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances.

==Distribution and habitat==
The least weasel has a circumboreal, Holarctic distribution, encompassing much of Europe and North Africa, Asia and parts of northern North America. It has been introduced to New Zealand, Malta, Crete, the Azore Islands and also São Tomé off West Africa. It occurs throughout Europe, except Ireland, and on all major Mediterranean islands. It also occurs on Honshu and Hokkaido Islands in Japan and on Kunashir, Iturup, and Sakhalin Islands in Russia.

The least weasel inhabits fields, open woodland, bushy and rocky areas, parks and gardens at elevations of up to about .

Fossilised remains of the least weasel are known from Denisova Cave.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
===Reproduction and development===
The least weasel mates in April–July and there is a 34- to 37-day gestation period. In the Northern Hemisphere, the average litter size consists of 6 kits and these reach sexual maturity in 3 to 4 months. Males may mate during their first year of life, though this is usually unsuccessful. They are fecund in February–October, though the early stages of spermatogenesis do occur throughout the winter months. Anestrus in females lasts from September until February.

The female raises her kits without help from the male. They are in weight at birth. Newborn kits are born pink, naked, blind and deaf, but gain a white coat of downy fur at the age of 4 days. At 10 days, the margin between the dark upper parts and light under parts becomes visible. The milk teeth erupt at 2 to 3 weeks of age, at which point the young start to eat solid food, though lactation can last 12 weeks. The eyes and ears open at 3 to 4 weeks of age, and by 8 weeks, killing behaviour is developed. The family breaks up after 9 to 12 weeks. There is a single litter each year and least weasels can live for 7 or 8 years.

===Territorial and social behaviours===

The least weasel has a typical mustelid territorial pattern, consisting of exclusive male ranges encompassing multiple female ranges. The population density of each territory depends greatly on food supply and reproductive success, thus the social structure and population density of any given territory is unstable and flexible. Like the stoat, the male least weasel extends his range during spring or during food shortages. Its scent marking behaviour is similar to that of the stoat; it uses faeces, urine and anal and dermal gland secretions, the latter two of which are deposited by anal dragging and body rubbing. The least weasel does not dig its own den, but nests in the abandoned burrow of another species such as a mole or rat. The burrow entrance measures about across and leads to the nest chamber located up to below ground. The nest chamber (which is used for sleeping, rearing kits and storing food) measures in diameter, and is lined with straw and the skins of the weasel&#x27;s prey.

The least weasel has four basic vocalisations; a guttural hiss emitted when alarmed, which is interspersed with short screaming barks and shrieks when provoked. When defensive, it emits a shrill wail or squeal. During encounters between males and females or between a mother and kits, the least weasel emits a high-pitched trilling. The least weasel&#x27;s way of expressing aggression is similar to that of the stoat. Dominant weasels exhibit lunges and shrieks during aggressive encounters, while subdominant weasels will emit submissive squeals.

===Diet===
The least weasel feeds predominantly on mouse-like rodents, including mice, hamsters, gerbils and others. It usually does not attack adult hamsters and rats. Frogs, fish, small birds and bird eggs are rarely eaten. It can deal with adult pikas and gerbils, but usually cannot overcome brown rats and sousliks. Exceptional cases are known of least weasels killing prey far larger than themselves, such as capercaillie, hazel hen and hares. In England, a favoured prey item is the field vole (&quot;Microtus agrestis&quot;). These have fluctuations in population size, and in years of abundance may form up to 54% of the weasel&#x27;s diet. In years of scarcity, birds form a greater proportion of the diet and female least weasels may fail to breed.

Despite its small size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable of killing a rabbit five to 10 times its own weight. Although they are commonly taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take a higher proportion of rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety of prey. This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity of prey.

The least weasel forages undercover, to avoid being seen by foxes and birds of prey. It is adapted for pursuing its prey down tunnels, though it may also bolt prey from a burrow and kill it in the open. The least weasel kills small prey, such as voles, with a bite to the occipital region of the skull or the neck, dislocating the cervical vertebrae. Large prey typically dies of blood loss or circulatory shock. When food is abundant, only a small portion of the prey is eaten, usually the brain. The average daily food intake is , which is equivalent to 30–35% of the animal&#x27;s body weight.

===Predators and competitors===

The least weasel is small enough to be preyed upon by a range of other predators. Least weasel remains have been found in the excrement of red foxes, sables, steppe and forest polecat, stoats, eagle owls and buzzards. The owls most efficient at capturing least weasels are barn, barred, and great horned owls. Other birds of prey threatening to the least weasel include broad-winged and rough-legged buzzards. Some snake species may prey on the least weasel, including the black rat snake and copperhead. Aside from its smaller size, the least weasel is more vulnerable to predation than the stoat because it lacks a black predator deflection mark on the tail.

In areas where the least weasel is sympatric with the stoat, the two species compete with each other for rodent prey. The weasel manages to avoid too much competition by living in more upland areas, feeding on smaller prey and being capable of entering smaller holes. It actively avoids encounters with stoats, though female weasels are less likely to stop foraging in the presence of stoats, perhaps because their smaller size allows them to quickly escape into holes.

=== Diseases and parasites ===
Ectoparasites known to infest weasels include the louse &quot;Trichodectes mustelae&quot; and the mites &quot;Demodex&quot; and &quot;Psoregates mustela&quot;. The species may catch fleas from the nests and burrows of its prey. Flea species known to infest weasels include &quot;Ctenophthalmus bisoctodentatus&quot; and &quot;Palaeopsylla m. minor&quot;, which they get from moles, &quot;P. s. soricis&quot;, which they get from shrews, &quot;Nosopsyllus fasciatus&quot;, which they get from rodents and &quot;Dasypsyllus gallinulae&quot; which they get from birds.

Helminths known to infest weasels include the trematode &quot;Alaria&quot;, the nematodes &quot;Capillaria&quot;, &quot;Filaroides&quot; and &quot;Trichinella&quot; and the cestode &quot;Taenia&quot;. Least weasels are commonly infected with the nematode &quot;Skrjabingylus nasicola&quot;, adults of which are found in the nasal sinuses and can damage the skull. There is no evidence that this has serious detrimental effects on even heavily infested animals.

==Conservation==
The least weasel is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, because of its wide global distribution and large population that is thought to be not in decline.

== In folklore and mythology ==
=== Macedonian and Greek culture ===

The Ancient Macedonians believed that to see a least weasel was a good omen. In some districts of Macedon, women who suffered from headaches after having washed their heads in water drawn overnight would assume that a weasel had previously used the water as a mirror, but they would refrain from mentioning the animal&#x27;s name for fear that it would destroy their clothes.

Similarly, a popular superstition in southern Greece had it that the least weasel had previously been a bride, who was transformed into a bitter animal which would destroy the wedding dresses of other brides out of jealousy. According to Pliny the Elder, the least weasel was the only animal that was capable of killing the basilisk:

To this dreadful monster the effluvium of the weasel is fatal, a thing that has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this struggle of nature against its own self.

=== Ojibwe and Inuit culture ===
The Ojibwe believed that the least weasel could kill the dreaded wendigo by rushing up its anus.

In Inuit mythology, the least weasel is credited with both great wisdom and courage, and whenever a mythical Inuit hero wished to accomplish a valorous task, he would generally change himself into a least weasel.

<text>The San Joaquin Valley ( ) is the southern half of California&#x27;s Central Valley. Famed as a major breadbasket, the San Joaquin Valley is an important source of food, producing a significant part of California&#x27;s agricultural output.

San Joaquin Valley draws from eight counties of Northern and one of Southern California, including all of San Joaquin and Kings counties, most of Stanislaus, Merced, and Fresno counties, and parts of Madera and Tulare counties, along with a majority of Kern County in Southern California. Although the valley is predominantly rural, it has three densely populated urban centers: Stockton/Modesto, Fresno/Visalia, and Bakersfield.

==Geography==

The San Joaquin Valley is the southern half of California&#x27;s Central Valley. It extends from the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta in the north to the Tehachapi Mountains in the south, and from the California coastal ranges (Diablo and Temblor) in the west to the Sierra Nevada in the east.

The valley contains two large river systems, divided north and south. The northern portion of San Joaquin Valley is called the San Joaquin Basin: the watershed of the San Joaquin River and its tributaries including parts of the Kings River, all of which drain northwest into the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta and eventually out to the Pacific Ocean. The somewhat larger southern portion is the Tulare Basin, an endorheic basin centered on Tulare Lake. Historically, Tulare Lake was fed by the Tule River, the Kings River, the Kaweah River, the White River and the Kern River, but much of this water has been diverted for agricultural uses and the watershed is mostly dry in its lower reaches.

===Geological history===

The San Joaquin Valley began to form about 66 million years ago during the early Paleocene era. Broad fluctuations in the sea level caused various areas of the valley to be flooded with ocean water for the next 60 million years. About 5 million years ago, the marine outlets began to close due to uplift of the coastal ranges and the deposition of sediment in the valley. Starting 2 million years ago, a series of glacial episodes periodically caused much of the valley to become a fresh water lake. Lake Corcoran was the last widespread lake to fill the valley about 700,000 years ago. At the beginning of the Holocene there were three major lakes remaining in the southern part of the Valley, Tulare Lake, Buena Vista Lake and Kern Lake. In the late 19th and in the 20th century, agricultural diversion of the Kern River eventually dried out these lakes. Today, only a fragment of Buena Vista Lake remains as two small lakes Lake Webb and Lake Evans in a portion of the former Buena Vista Lakebed.

===Climate===
The San Joaquin Valley has extremely hot, dry summers and pleasantly mild winters characterized by dense tule fog. Its rainy season normally runs from November through April. The valley has experienced a severe and intensifying megadrought since the early 2010s. This drought is not only affecting humans, with farmland taking much of the impact, but also the wildlife as well.

In August 2015, the Director of the California Department of Water Resources stated, &quot;Because of increased pumping, groundwater levels are reaching record lows—up to 100 feet lower than previous records.&quot; 
Research from NASA shows that parts of the San Joaquin Valley sank as much as in a four-month period, and land near Corcoran sank in 8 months. The sinking has destroyed thousands of groundwater well casings and has the potential to damage aqueducts, roads, bridges, and flood-control structures. In the long term, the subsidence caused by extracting groundwater could irreversibly reduce the underground aquifer&#x27;s water storage capacity, although immediate and short term needs are given higher priority and sense of urgency than long term sustainability.

The National Weather Service Forecast Office for the San Joaquin Valley is located in Hanford and includes a Doppler weather radar. Weather forecasts and climatological information for the San Joaquin Valley are available from its official website.

==Early human settlement==
The San Joaquin Valley was originally inhabited by the Yokuts and Miwok peoples. The first European to enter the valley was Pedro Fages in 1772.

The Tejon Indian Tribe of California is a federally recognized tribe of Kitanemuk, Yokuts, and Chumash indigenous people of California. Their ancestral homeland is the southern San Joaquin Valley, San Emigdio Mountains, and Tehachapi Mountains. Today they live in Kern County, California, headquartered in Wasco and Bakersfield, California.

The Picayune Rancheria of Chukchansi Indians of California is a federally recognized tribe of indigenous people of California, Chukchansi or Foothills Yokuts, now located in Madera County in the San Joaquin Valley. The Santa Rosa Rancheria belongs to the federally recognized Tachi Yokuts tribe and is located southeast of Lemoore, California, in the San Joaquin Valley. Since 2010, statewide droughts in California have further strained both the San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s and the Sacramento Valley&#x27;s water security.

==Demographics==
The total population of the eight counties comprising the San Joaquin Valley at the time of the 2011-2015 American Community Survey 5-year Estimates by United States Census Bureau reported a population of 4,080,509. The racial composition of San Joaquin Valley was 1,428,978 (35.0%) Non-Hispanic White, 2,048,280 (50.2%) Hispanic or Latino, 310,557 (7.6%) Asian, 193,694 (4.7%) Black or African American, 40,911 (1.0%) American Indian and Alaska Native, and 13,000 (0.32%) Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander.

The educational attainment of high school graduate or higher is 72.7%.

===Poverty===
According to the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s American Community Survey, six San Joaquin Valley counties had the highest percentage of residents living below the federal poverty line in 2006 of any counties in California. The report also showed that the same six counties were among the 52 counties with the highest poverty rate in the United States. The median income for a household in the valley was $46,713. The poverty rate for individuals below the poverty level is 23.7%. In 2005 U.S. congressional researchers compared the economically distressed Valley to the traditionally impoverished Appalachia region, resulting in the appellation New Appalachia.

In 2011 &quot;Forbes,&quot; after taking the fluctuation of median home values, five of the top twenty &quot;most miserable cities&quot; were located in the San Joaquin Valley. Aside from the collapse of median home values, persistent crime, unemployment and poverty were common factors between Bakersfield, Fresno, Merced, Modesto and Stockton – every major city of the San Joaquin Valley.

==== Medical access ====
Insufficient access to medicine in the United States, in particular prenatal and preventive care, is typified by both rural and inner city communities. Early and adequate access to prenatal care is important to maternal and child health and is another comparative indicator of community health. According to the California Department of Health Services, 37% of births in Merced County occurred with no or late prenatal care and the San Joaquin Valley average was 19.5% of births with no or late prenatal care. By comparison, the California average was 13.6% of births and the national average was 10% of births

Likewise, the counties of the San Joaquin Valley have relatively high ratios of population to physicians, suggesting relatively low access, with the highest in Kings County at 1,027 patients per a physician, the San Joaquin Valley average at approximately 671 patients per a physician and the California average of 400 patients per a physician. Another measure of access is licensed acute care hospital beds per thousand population, where the Kings County average of 1.1 beds per a thousand and the San Joaquin Valley average of 1.8 beds per a thousand were again less than the state average of 2.1 bed per a thousand. Consequently, the age adjusted death rate is significantly higher than the rest of California.

In response the University of California with the University of California, Merced is exploring opening a research medical school specializing in rural care, in hopes that some graduates will settle in the San Joaquin Valley and provide better healthcare.

===Ethnic and cultural groups===

====Latinos/Hispanics, Chicanos and Mexicans====

Currently, the Latino and Mexican descendants are a large percentage of the demographics in the San Joaquin Valley. Since not long after the onset of the &quot;bracero&quot; program during World War II, all but a minor percentage of the farmworkers in the region have been of Mexican ancestry. Ethnic and economic friction between Mexican-Americans and the valley&#x27;s predominantly white farming elite manifested itself most notably during the 1960s and 1970s, when the United Farm Workers, led by César Chávez, went on numerous strikes and called for boycotts of table grapes. The UFW generated enormous sympathy throughout the United States, even managing to terminate several agricultural mechanization projects at the United States Department of Agriculture. Consequently from the 1970s onward, landlords and large corporations have hired undocumented immigrants. This has allowed them to increase their profits due to low overhead on wages.

====European groups====
The San Joaquin Valley has—by California standards—an unusually large number of European, Middle Eastern, and Asian ethnicities in the heritage of its citizens. These communities are often quite large and, relative to Americans immigration patterns, quite eclectic: for example, there are more Azorean Portuguese in the San Joaquin Valley than in the Azores. Many groups are found in majorities in specific cities, and hardly anywhere else in the region. For example, Assyrians are concentrated in Turlock, Dutch in Ripon, and Croats in Delano. Kingsburg is famous for its distinctly Swedish air, having been founded by immigrants from that country. Ethnic groups found in a broader area are Portuguese, Germans, Armenians, Basques, and the &quot;Okies&quot; of primarily English and Scots-Irish descent who migrated to California from the Midwest and South. Mennonite groups descended from Russian Germans settled in the areas of Reedley and Dinuba, as well as Lutheran and Catholic Volga Germans who settled in the broader Fresno area.

==== Asian Americans ====
The San Joaquin Valley has a large and exceptionally diverse Asian American population; primarily from the regions of Punjab in India and Pakistan, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia, especially Laos and Cambodia.

Punjabi Sikh Americans have immigrated to the San Joaquin Valley since the early 1900s and 1910s, and remain a very large presence in the area. To this day, Punjabi is the third most spoken language in the San Joaquin Valley region, after English and Spanish, and the first Sikh Gurdwara was founded in Stockton in 1915. Following abolition of immigration restrictions from Asia in the 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of Pakistanis and Indians from Punjab, Gujarat, and Southern India have settled in these valley communities including Modesto, Livingston, Fresno, Stockton, and Lodi.

In addition, the late 1970s and &#x27;80s saw an influx of immigrants from Indochina following the War in Vietnam. These immigrants, the majority of whom are Hmong, Laotian, Cambodian, and Vietnamese, have largely settled in the communities of Stockton, Modesto, Merced, and Fresno. Hmongs, Laotians, and Cambodians are the largest communities of Southeast Asians in the San Joaquin Valley, and the valley has some of the largest populations of these groups in the nation. Fresno has the second-largest Hmong population of any American metropolitan area after Minneapolis–Saint Paul, and Stockton is believed to have the largest percentage of Cambodian Americans of any major American metropolitan area. Merced, Modesto, Fresno, Visalia, and Stockton have some of the largest populations of Laotian Americans in the United States.

The Filipino American population is concentrated in Delano and Lathrop. Filipinos have a strong history in Stockton. Filipino organizations in Stockton are reflected in various commercial buildings identified as Filipino. Filipinos fought for the U.S. against Japan in WWII, in exchange for favorable immigration status. Stockton has been an adjunct to the San Francisco Bay Area, which was a major military production and transit area during WWII. Filipino emigration to Stockton followed.

====African Americans====
Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park marks the location of the only California town to be founded, financed and governed by African Americans. The small farming community was founded in 1908 by Lt. Colonel Allen Allensworth, Professor William Payne, William Peck, a minister, John W. Palmer, a miner, and Harry A. Mitchell, a real estate agent, dedicated to improving the economic and social status of African Americans. Uncontrollable circumstances, including a drop in the area&#x27;s water table, resulted in the town&#x27;s demise.

====Okies and Arkies====
The Depression-era migrants to the San Joaquin Valley from the South and Midwest are one of the more well-known groups in the Central Valley, in large part due to the popularity of John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and the Henry Fonda movie made from it. By 1910, agriculture in the southern Great Plains had become nearly unviable due to soil erosion and poor rainfall. Much of the rural population of states such as Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas left at this time, selling their land and moving to Chicago, Kansas City, Detroit, Denver, Phoenix, Las Vegas and fast-growing Los Angeles. Those who remained experienced continuing deterioration of conditions, which reached their nadir during the drought that began in the late 1920s and created the infamous Dust Bowl. (Small cotton farmers, many of them Black, in states such as Mississippi and Alabama suffered similar problems from the first major infestation of the boll weevil.) When the onset of the Great Depression created a national banking crisis, family farmers—usually heavily in debt—often had their mortgages foreclosed by banks desperate to shore up their balance sheets. In response, many farmers loaded their families and portable possessions into their automobiles and drove west.

Many of the Okies and Arkies left the San Joaquin Valley during World War II, most of them going to Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego to work in war-related industries. Many of those who stayed ended up in Bakersfield and Oildale, as the southern San Joaquin Valley became an important area of oil production after major Southern California oil fields such as Signal Hill began to dry up. Country music legends Buck Owens (from Texas) and Merle Haggard came out of Bakersfield&#x27;s honky-tonk scene and created a hard-driving sound that is still deeply associated with the city.

==Economy==
===Agriculture===
The San Joaquin Valley produces 12.8% of California&#x27;s agricultural production (as measured by dollar value). Often called a breadbasket region, the valley farms emphasize fruits, vegetables and nuts more than grain for bread. Major crops include grapes (wine grapes, table grapes and raisins), cotton, almonds, pistachios, citrus, and vegetables. Walnuts, oranges, peaches, garlic, tangerines, tomatoes, kiwis, hay, alfalfa and numerous other crops have been harvested with great success. Certain places are identified quite strongly with a given crop: Stockton produces the majority of the domestic asparagus consumed in the United States, and Fresno County is the largest producer of raisins.

Cattle and sheep ranching are also vitally important to the valley&#x27;s economy. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, the Miller &amp; Lux corporation built an agricultural monopoly centered around cattle. The corporation can be characterized as a precursor to corporate farming transforming the yeoman farmer into wage workers. The success of the business can be attributed to founder Henry Miller&#x27;s direct management style which is reflected in his detailed correspondences to his subordinates. During recent years, dairy farming has greatly expanded in importance. As areas such as Chino and Corona have become absorbed into the suburban sprawl of Los Angeles, many dairy farmers have cashed out and moved their herds to Kings, Tulare, and Kern counties.

Between 1990 and 2004, 28,092 hectares (70,231 acres) of agricultural land was lost to urban development in the San Joaquin Valley. Although there have been some token efforts at confronting the problems of (sub)urban sprawl, the politically conservative climate of the Valley generally prefers traditional suburban sprawl type of growth such as low density housing and strip malls anchored by so-called big box stores and opposes measures such as &quot;Smart Growth&quot;, &quot;Transit Oriented Development&quot;, &quot;High Density Housing&quot;, and increased public transit such as light and commuter rail. By August 2014, a three-year drought was prompting changes to the agriculture industry in the valley. Farmers began using complex irrigation systems and using treated waste water to feed crops, while many were switching from farming cotton to other commodities, chief among them, almonds.

===Petroleum===
California has long been one of the nation&#x27;s most important oil-producing states, and the San Joaquin Valley has long since eclipsed the Los Angeles Basin as the state&#x27;s primary oil production region. Scattered oil wells on small oil fields are found throughout the region, and several enormous extraction facilities – most notably near Lost Hills and Taft, including the enormous Midway-Sunset Oil Field, the third-largest oil field in the United States – are veritable forests of pumps.

Shell operated a major refinery in Bakersfield; it was sold in 2005 to Flying J, a Salt Lake-based firm that operates truck stops and refineries. Flying J&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2009 resulted in the refinery being shut down.

The oil and gas fields in Kern County are receiving increased attention since the July 2009 announcement by Occidental Petroleum of significant discovery of oil and gas reserves Even prior to this discovery the region retains more oil reserves than any other part of California. Of California fields outside of the San Joaquin Valley, only the Wilmington Oil Field in Los Angeles County has untapped reserves greater than , while six fields in the San Joaquin Valley (Midway-Sunset, Kern River, South Belridge, Elk Hills, Cymric, and Lost Hills) each have reserves exceeding of oil.

===Other major industries and employers===
The isolation and vastness of the San Joaquin Valley, as well as its poverty and need for jobs, have led the state to build numerous prisons in the area. The most notable of these is Corcoran, whose inmates have included Charles Manson and Juan Corona. Other correctional facilities in the valley are at Avenal, Chowchilla, Tracy, Delano, Coalinga, and Wasco.

The only significant military base in the region is Naval Air Station Lemoore, a vast air base located WSW of Hanford. Unlike many of California&#x27;s other military installations, NAS Lemoore&#x27;s operational importance has increased in the 1990s and 2000s. The other, Castle Air Force Base, located near Atwater was closed during the Base Realignment and Closure of the 1990s. Although both are in Kern County, Edwards Air Force Base and China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station are located in the High Desert area of that county.

===Recent changes===
The California real estate boom that began in the late 1990s has significantly changed the San Joaquin Valley. Once distinctly and fiercely independent of Los Angeles and San Francisco, the area has seen increasing exurban development as the cost of living forces young families and small businesses further and further away from the coastal urban cores. Stockton, Modesto, Tracy (as well as the nearby city of Mountain House), Manteca, and Los Banos are increasingly dominated by commuters to San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and the small farming towns to the south are finding themselves in the Bay Area&#x27;s orbit as well. Bakersfield, traditionally a boom-bust oil town once described by urban scholar Joel Kotkin as an &quot;American Abu Dhabi,&quot; has seen a massive influx of former Los Angeles business owners and commuters, to the extent that gated communities containing million-dollar homes are going up on the city&#x27;s outskirts. Wal-Mart, IKEA, Target, Amazon, CVS Pharmacy, Restoration Hardware, and other various large shipping firms have built huge distribution centers both in the southern end of the valley and northern part of the valley because of quick access to major interstates and low local wages. Further integration with the rest of the state is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transportation ===

==== Roads ====

Interstate 5 (I-5) and State Route 99 (SR 99) each run nearly the entire length of the San Joaquin Valley. I-5 runs in the western part of the valley, bypassing the major population centers (including Fresno, currently the largest U.S. city without an Interstate highway), while SR 99 runs through them. Both highways then merge at the southern end of valley en route to Los Angeles. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, the decision was made to build I-5 as an entirely then-new freeway bypass instead of upgrading the then-existing U.S. 99. Since then, state and federal representatives have pushed to convert SR 99 to an Interstate, although this cannot occur until all of the portions of SR 99 between I-5 and the U.S. 50 junction in Sacramento are upgraded to Interstate standards.

State Route 58 (SR 58), which is a freeway in Bakersfield and along most of its route until its terminus in Barstow, is an extremely important and very heavily traveled route for truckers from the valley and the Bay Area who want to cross the Sierra Nevada and leave California (by way of Interstate 15 or Interstate 40) without having to climb Donner Pass or brave the traffic congestion of Los Angeles. Proposals have also been made to designate this highway as a western extension of I-40 once the entirety of the route between Mojave and Barstow has been upgraded to a freeway. This would provide an Interstate connection for Bakersfield, currently the second-largest U.S. city without an Interstate. The most recent additions to this system are State Routes 168 and 180. Route 168 begins in Fresno on Route 180 linking to Huntington Lake in the mountains through Clovis and many smaller communities. This route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System. State Route 180 is a state highway which runs through the heart of the San Joaquin Valley from Mendota through Fresno to Kings Canyon National Park. A short piece near the eastern end, through the Grant Grove section of Kings Canyon National Park, is not state-maintained. The part east of unbuilt State Route 65 near Minkler is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System; the road east of Dunlap is the Kings Canyon Scenic Byway, a Forest Service Byway.

Other important highways in the valley include State Route 46 (SR 46) and State Route 41 (SR 41), which respectively link the California Central Coast with Bakersfield and Fresno; State Route 33 (SR 33), which runs south to north along the valley&#x27;s western rim and provides a connection to Ventura and Santa Barbara over the Santa Ynez Mountains; and State Route 152 (SR 152), an important commuter route linking Silicon Valley with its fast-growing exurbs such as Los Banos.

==== Air ====

The major airport in San Joaquin Valley is the Fresno Yosemite International Airport, which offers scheduled passenger flights to several major airline hubs in the United States and international service to Mexico. Additionally, there are three non primary airports in the region: Meadows Field Airport near Bakersfield, Stockton Metropolitan Airport and Merced Municipal Airport.

==== Rail ====

The &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service handles passenger traffic between Bakersfield and Stockton with extensions to either Sacramento or Oakland. Amtrak rail service does not continue south of Bakersfield, as the Union Pacific Railroad does not currently allow the San Joaquins trains to run on the highly congested rail route over Tehachapi Pass, which is the only route between Bakersfield and Los Angeles. Passengers between these towns must travel on Amtrak Thruway buses. The San Joaquin Valley is also the location of the planned initial operating segment of the California High-Speed Rail (CAHSR) project, which will run 171 miles from Bakersfield in the south to Merced in the north.

Freight service is provided by BNSF Railway, Union Pacific Railroad and San Joaquin Valley Railroad.

=== Electricity ===
The valley is served by the Western Area Power Administration. Western owns and operates its own equipment here and so performs its own weed management. Rotating and mixing herbicide modes of action are employed to preserve efficacy.

==Public health==
=== Air pollution ===
Located between mountains, and rarely having strong winds to disperse smog, the San Joaquin Valley has some of the United States&#x27; worst air pollution, with a PM2.5 measure of 17 micrograms per cubic meter of air, compared to the California&#x27;s Ambient Air Quality Standard of 12 micrograms per cubic meter, and the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 9 micrograms per cubic meter. Some of the San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s sources of air pollution are vehicle emissions, agricultural practices, and crop and wildfires. The use of diesel and gasoline fueled vehicles produces an excess of nitrogen oxides (NOx), eventually forming nitric acid that reacts with ammonia gas from cow manure and urine to create the ammonium nitrate that “accounts for more than half of the region’s PM2.5 on the area’s most polluted days.” Exacerbated by stagnant weather and the temperature drop of the cooler seasons, much of the air pollution becomes trapped beneath a layer of warmer air, resulting in a phenomenon known as temperature inversion and condensing the accumulation of pollutants within the valley.

Population growth has caused the San Joaquin Valley to rank with Los Angeles and Houston in most measures of air pollution. Only the Inland Empire region east of Los Angeles has worse overall air quality, and the San Joaquin Valley led the nation in 2004 in the number of days with quantities of ozone considered unhealthy by the Environmental Protection Agency. The San Joaquin Valley has been deemed an &quot;extreme non-attainment zone&quot; by the Environmental Protection Agency, meaning residents are exposed to air quality that is confirmed to be hazardous to human health.

==== Crop loss ====
The region of the San Joaquin Valley has some of the richest soil that allows for the production of many crops.  Crops in this region include: grapes, oranges, cotton, vegetables and nuts. The plethora of crop land allows for the valley to benefit from the income of crop sales. About sixty percent of California&#x27;s crops come from the land in this area. However, the unhealthy air levels that arise from smog lead to the destruction of many crops. According to the California Air Resources Board the San Joaquin Valley loses about one billion dollars every year due to the pollution in the air destroying these crops. When crops die off, farmers sometimes burn the waste as a convenience and inexpensive way to clear land and dispose of waste. Crop burning worsens the air quality, and contribes roughly 4% of the San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s fine particle pollution.

==== Negative effects on public health ====
The San Joaquin Valley suffers from extremely high ozone levels that tend to increase even more on hot days. Kids are more inclined to play outdoors during summer when the weather is warmer. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency this could lead to health issues such as asthma because these children are not fully developed yet. According to the American Lung Association, roughly one in six children in this region suffer from asthma due to the poor air quality. The elderly population is also vulnerable to air pollution and could even suffer from heart attacks due to decreased lung functions.  Reports state that the residents in this community suffer from high rates of asthma and experience many related symptoms. The American Lung Association attributes the noxious gas in the San Joaquin Valley to roughly 1,300 premature deaths every year, including public impacts such as lost days of school or work and emergency room visits. Due to the frequency of these extreme cases, the San Joaquin Valley has lost as much as $11 billion each year.

=== Nitrates in groundwater ===
San Joaquin Valley is a major agricultural center of California. The agricultural demand for water far outstrips the urban and industrial demand. Overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and irrigated agriculture is common, and according to Thomas Harter, the chair for Water Resources Management and Policy at UC Davis, “more than 80 pounds of nitrogen per acre per year may leach into groundwater beneath irrigated lands, usually as nitrates”. Between the 1950s and 1980s, when nitrogen fertilizer use grew sixfold, nitrate concentrations in groundwater increased 2.5 times. Fertilizer runoffs contributes roughly 90% of all nitrate inputs to the alluvial groundwater system. Within agriculture, the two major factors are &quot;High-Intensity Crop Production&quot; and &quot;Large Dairy Herds.&quot; Because these communities are cut off from larger water distribution, they are dependent on wells, making groundwater a source of drinking water for 90% of San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s residents.

Nitrates have found their way into the aquifers around the San Joaquin Valley, affecting over 250,000 people in communities that are poor and rural. In 2006, the State Water Resources Board took samples from domestic wells in Tulare County; they found that 40% of 181 domestic wells had nitrate levels above the 10 mg/L legal limit. Though locals have typically used filters for their water, the filters need to be installed correctly and replaced frequently, which may not be economically feasible for the residents in Orosi. Table 2 on page 20 from Pacific Institute&#x27;s &quot;The Human Costs of Nitrate-contaminated Drinking Water in the San Joaquin Valley&quot; indicates the water systems that were contaminated with nitrates over the legal limit, the percentage of the population affected that are non-white and that are below or near poverty-level, and the year since the violations began.
The Turlock Basin is a sub-basin of the San Joaquin Valley groundwater basin found within Stanislaus County and Merced County in the Central Valley. In California&#x27;s Groundwater Bulletin 118, a chart, linked below, illustrates the number of non-compliant public supply wells with nitrates over the MCL. According to this chart, there were eight wells which had nitrate levels above the 10 mg/L MCL, out of 90 sampled for nitrates in 2006.

Nitrates are of concern because it interferes with the blood&#x27;s ability to carry oxygen, and can have severe health effects on pregnant women, infants under 6 months, and children using tap water for their formula. Because nitrates interfere with blood&#x27;s capacity to carry oxygen, infants are at high risk of death from blue-baby syndrome, which can occur when there are high nitrate levels in the blood that are untreated.

==== High-intensity crop production ====
Within the past century, farmers have been increasing their production to meet high demand. To increase output and efficiency, farmers have increased the amount of fertilizers used, including nitrates. Because only a fraction of the nitrogen in fertilizers is efficiently used to help produce crops, this has led to a greater concentration of nitrates and phosphates in the waters, causing eutrophication and contamination of possible drinking water.

==== Large dairy herds ====
Before the rapid rise in demand for meat products and dairy, roaming dairy herds had contributed an insignificant amount of nitrate pollution to the underlying groundwater systems. However, within the past few decades, the increasing amount of cattle has been one of the main contributors of nitrate contamination in the groundwater systems of California. Roughly around 1960, cattle were openly grazing pastures, and because of the large amount of lands which they roamed manure was not intensively managed. However, even though manure was not closely managed, &quot;Nitrogen excretion and deposition in pastures likely did not exceed pasture buffering capacity and had no significant leaching to groundwater&quot;. Since the transition to dry-lot and free stall-based dairy farming in the mid-1970s, coupled with irrigated forage crops, dairy herds have contributed to nitrogen contamination.

==== Possible solutions and alternatives ====
The large dairy herds create manure, which is used to create the fertilizers that is applied to the crop fields. As demand for crops increases, farmers look to lower the costs of production. Using manure-based fertilizers is cost effective since manure is a by-product of large dairy farms and herds. The alternative to manure, which contains a high level of nitrates, is composting. Composting however is relatively expensive compared to using manure as fertilizer, since it is not as effective and is more timely/costly to make because of the large amount of aeration needed.

===Non-fluoridation of tap water ===
Fluoridation is adding an element of fluoride to drinking water to reduce the occurrence of dental issues like tooth decay. Cal Water requires fluoride in water systems if public funding is available. In 2011, the Stockton city council asked its waterworks for grants and other sources of funding of $4.6 million to add fluoride to water that will serve approximately 280,000 people. 

=== Valley Fever ===
Valley Fever, or coccidioidomycosis, is a fungal infection caused by &quot;Coccidioides immitis&quot; through the inhalation of airborne dust or dirt. The valley is just one of the areas in the southwestern United States where the illness is endemic due to C. immitis residing in the soil.

<text>The Sacramento Valley is the area of the Central Valley of the U.S. state of California that lies north of the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta and is drained by the Sacramento River. It encompasses all or parts of ten Northern California counties. Although many areas of the Sacramento Valley are rural, it contains several urban areas, including the state capital, Sacramento.

Comparatively water-rich relative to the other segment of the Central Valley to the south, the San Joaquin Valley, there are slight differences in the crops typically grown in the Sacramento Valley. Much wetter winters (averaging between of annual precipitation in the nearby foothills) and an extensive system of irrigation canals allows for the economic viability of water-thirsty crops such as rice and &quot;Juglans hindsii&quot;-rootstock walnuts. Since 2010, statewide droughts in California (combined with unprecedented summer heat) have strained both the Sacramento Valley&#x27;s and the Sacramento metropolitan region&#x27;s water security.

==Geography==
The Sacramento River and its tributaries are a significant part of the geography of the Sacramento Valley. Rising in the various mountain ranges (the various Northern Coast Ranges to the west, the southern Siskiyou Mountains to the north, and the northern Sierra Nevada to the east) that define the shape of the valley, they provide water for agricultural, industrial, residential, and recreation uses. Most of the rivers are heavily dammed and diverted. In more recent years, statewide droughts in California have further strained the Sacramento Valley&#x27;s water security.

The terrain of the Sacramento Valley is primarily flat grasslands that become lusher as one moves east from the rain shadow of the Coast Ranges toward the Sierra. Unlike the San Joaquin Valley, which in its pre-irrigation state was a vegetation-hostile desert, the somewhat less arid Sacramento Valley had significant tracts of forest prior to the arrival of settlers of European ancestry. Most of it was cut down during the California Gold Rush and the ensuing wave of American settlement, although there are still some heavily tree-populated areas, such as the greater Sacramento area.

Foothills become more common from just south of Corning to Shasta Lake City. These are known as the Valley Hills and begin south of the Tehama-Glenn County line near Corning. There are also a few hills in Red Bluff and Corning. There is one major range of foothills between Cottonwood and Red Bluff known as the Cottonwood Hills (a.k.a. 9-mile Hill), and there is the Cottonwood Ridge between Anderson and Cottonwood. There are some hills in Redding, a few more than Red Bluff, and north of Redding it is mainly foothills.

One distinctive geographic feature of the Sacramento Valley is the Sutter Buttes. Nicknamed the smallest mountain range in the world, it consists of the remnants of an extinct volcano and is located just outside Yuba City, 44 miles north of Sacramento.

==Agriculture==

Citrus and nut orchards and cattle ranches are common to both halves of the Central Valley. The Sacramento Valley&#x27;s agricultural industry also resembles that of the San Joaquin Valley to the south. Nuts, such as almonds and walnuts, are of greater importance north of the Delta, and rice, nonviable in the drier San Joaquin Valley, is a major crop. While the region is wetter, soils are somewhat poorer in the Sacramento Valley; this means some crops, particularly vegetables, are less profitable compared to the San Joaquin Valley. The Sacramento Valley is also not as extensively cultivated; there are many more smallholdings and more uncultivated arable land compared to south of the Delta.

The town of Corning produces olives for oil extraction and for consumption as fruit. The Sunsweet Growers Incorporated headquarters are in Yuba City. The valley controls more than two-thirds of the worldwide prune market through the over 400 growers in California.

==Climate==
Weather patterns in the Sacramento Valley are very similar to those in the San Joaquin Valley to the south, although the humidity and precipitation tend to be a bit higher. Summers are the dry season, with average daytime temperatures in the low to high 90s °F (low to mid 30s °C) but triple digits (38 °C and above) are a common occurrence, especially in Chico, Redding, Red Bluff, and Sacramento. Redding in particular has been notorious for having extremely hot summers despite its northern latitude within the United States, with temperatures often matching and even exceeding that of Phoenix, Arizona in its hottest years; the city&#x27;s annual high temperature averages at .

In the summer, the &quot;Delta Breeze&quot;, which comes in from the San Francisco Bay Area, is known for bringing cooler temperatures and higher humidity to the southern parts of the valley. While it brings comparative relief for residents of Sacramento and Roseville, it often results in somewhat muggy conditions, with dew points sometimes reaching above and occasionally pushing the heat index above on the hottest days. At times the Breeze is gusty with wind speeds up to 30 mph (50 km/h) in the valley and 45 mph (75 km/h) in the windy delta region. This Breeze can also bring morning low clouds at times into the region, but the clouds generally burn off quickly and temperatures stay cool. Summer-like conditions continue into early to mid-September but weather starts to change to cooler, wetter, foggier weather during October which gives trees vibrant autumn foliage.

Winters, also known as the rainy season, are generally mild to cool, foggy and wet. The valley and lower foothills are completely snowless outside of exceptional years where some flurries may occur. The rainy season runs from November to early-April, with some rainfall in September, October, and May. Up north, the temperature averages in the mid-40s °F (mid-to-high single digits °C) and lows reaching to the low-10s °F (-10 to -12 °C), colder in the northern part of the valley and colder still in the foothills and frost can occur almost anywhere. Farther south near Sacramento, temperatures tend to stay between the low-50s and high-60s °F (10-20 °C), with nighttime temperatures dropping to the mid-30s and 40s °F (1-7 °C). Lower-elevation snowfall (in a relative sense) is more consistent in the foothills immediately above Sacramento and Folsom than anywhere else in California; Pollock Pines at , gets an average of of snow every winter, nearly double that of Yosemite Valley and more than triple that of Lucerne, Switzerland.

During the rainy season, the Sacramento Valley is prone to strong thunderstorms and tornadoes, mostly of EF0 or EF1 intensity, especially in Colusa County and areas around Corning and Orland. Flooding does occur at times during wetter periods, usually November to March. Snow in the valley is rare, although Redding and Red Bluff, being at the north end of the valley, often experience a light dusting or two per year. Chico may get a rain-snow mix every few years, but, on the average, only snows about every 5 years. Farther south in Sacramento, snow rarely occurs. During the autumn and winter months, the entire Central Valley is susceptible to dense tule fog that makes driving hazardous, especially at night and especially south of Corning. The fog can last for weeks depending on how weak the wind is. In more recent years, statewide droughts in California have further strained both the Sacramento Valley&#x27;s and the San Joaquin Valley&#x27;s water security.


==Transportation==

Interstate 5 is the primary route through the Sacramento Valley, traveling north–south roughly along the valley&#x27;s western edge. Interstate 80 cuts a northeast-to-southwest swath through the southern end of the valley, mostly through Sacramento and Yolo Counties, and ends at the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Several secondary routes connect the two roads, including Interstate 505 and State Route 113. The Sacramento area has a web of urban freeways.

Other principal routes in the region include State Route 99, which runs along the valley&#x27;s eastern edge, roughly parallel to I-5, from Sacramento until its northern terminus in Red Bluff; State Route 20, which traverses the valley from west to east on its route from State Route 1 in Mendocino County to the Donner Pass; State Route 49, named in honor of the California Gold Rush and running through many old mining towns in the foothills of the valley; and State Route 45, which runs along the course of the Sacramento River roughly ten miles (20 km) east of I-5.

The Union Pacific Railroad serves the valley, with its principal north–south line from Oakland, California to Portland, Oregon, via Sacramento, Marysville, Chico, and Redding. This is also the route of Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; passenger train. The Union Pacific also has two east–west lines, through Donner Pass (the former Central Pacific Railroad), and through the Feather River gorge (the former Western Pacific Railroad). Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;California Zephyr&quot; uses the Donner Pass route. The BNSF Railway has a line from Klamath Falls, Oregon, to a junction with the Union Pacific Feather River line at Keddie. The BNSF has trackage rights on both the UP east–west routes. In addition, the California Northern Railroad operates the former Southern Pacific Railroad line on the west side of the valley from Davis to Tehama (near Red Bluff).

In the story, the small town of Bridgton, Maine is shrouded in a dense mist that conceals otherworldly creatures. The protagonist and narrator David Drayton, who has taken refuge with his young son in a supermarket, tries to survive against not only the creatures of the mist, but also fanatical aggression from other survivors. In &quot;The Mist&quot;, King addresses the themes of man-made fears and religious fundamentalism.

King was inspired to write &quot;The Mist&quot; by a trip to his local supermarket following a thunderstorm, during which he imagined prehistoric animals and giant insects besieging the building. &quot;The Mist&quot; was nominated for a World Fantasy Award and a Locus Award in 1981, and critics have considered it to be one of King&#x27;s iconic works and a classic in its genre. Some reviewers lamented the superficial explanation of the mist&#x27;s nature, while others were pleased with the cinematic presentation. A film adaptation directed by Frank Darabont was released in 2007, and a television series based on the novella&#x27;s premise aired on Spike in 2017.

==Plot==
The morning after a severe thunderstorm leaves the town of Bridgton, Maine without electrical power, an unnaturally thick mist gradually envelopes the area. Commercial artist David Drayton, along with his young son Billy and neighbor Brent Norton (whose prized vintage car has been smashed by a fallen tree), go to the local supermarket for groceries, leaving David&#x27;s wife Stephanie behind at their home. Upon arrival, their suspicions are aroused by the sound of a siren. The mist completely covers the supermarket and conceals strange and hostile creatures. The situation is aggravated by an earthquake, which damages communications and leaves the store without electricity. When a young bagger, Norm, goes outside to fix a clogged vent in the store&#x27;s generator, he is dragged into the mist by a mass of giant tentacles. 

David and assistant manager Ollie Weeks witness Norm&#x27;s death and try to convince the remaining survivors of what has happened, imploring that no one leave the store. Norton and a small group of people accuse David of lying and go outside for help, only to be killed by unnatural predatory creatures. Ollie is given a revolver by the young Amanda Dumfries. Large &quot;insects&quot; begin crawling over the outside of the store, attracting pterosaur-like creatures, one of which squirms inside through a broken window and is killed with an improvised torch amidst a general panic. Searching for an escape and needing to treat an elderly woman who was injured in the panic, David leads a group of people to retrieve medical supplies from an adjacent pharmacy, where they encounter huge spider-like creatures. Only half the expedition returns alive, heavily demoralizing everyone else inside the store. 
Two soldiers from a nearby military base are soon found to have committed suicide in the stockroom, leading Ollie and David to speculate about what they knew, and the much-rumored &quot;Arrowhead Project&quot; experiments conducted at the base where the soldiers were stationed.
In the wake of mass hysteria among the survivors, religious fanatic Mrs.Carmody gradually convinces them that the current events fulfill a biblical prophecy of the end times, and that human sacrifice is required to save themselves from God&#x27;s wrath.

When David, Billy, Ollie, Amanda and a few other survivors attempt to escape to David&#x27;s car, they are confronted by Mrs.Carmody, who calls on the crowd to offer Billy and Amanda as sacrifices. Ollie shoots and kills Mrs.Carmody, and her &quot;congregation&quot; dissolves in confusion. En route to the car, Ollie and one other survivor are killed, while another flees back to the store. The rest attempt to reach David&#x27;s house to determine Stephanie&#x27;s fate, but the driveway is hopelessly blocked by fallen trees. They drive south through a devastated and mist-shrouded New England, witnessing further signs of catastrophe and more mysterious creatures. While stopped for the night, David searches the radio bands and, through the mist&#x27;s interference, possibly hears someone say &quot;Hartford&quot;, giving him a last shred of hope.

==Influences==
King, in the Notes section in &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;, says &quot;The Mist&quot; was inspired by a real-life experience, when a massive thunderstorm much like the one that opens the story occurred where King lived at the time. The day after the storm, he went to a local supermarket with his son. While looking for hot dog buns, King imagined a &quot;big prehistoric flying reptile&quot; flapping around in the store. By the time the two were in line to pay for their purchases, King had the basis for his story: survivors trapped in a supermarket surrounded by unknown creatures.

While experiencing the unusual spring weather which precedes the storm, some characters make reference to the real-life Great Blizzard of 1888, which devastated much of the northeastern United States.

==Influence in other media==

===Film===
*A film adaptation of the novella, titled &quot;The Mist&quot; (2007), was directed by Frank Darabont and starred Thomas Jane. This adaptation adds information about the &quot;Arrowhead Project&quot; and the origins of the mist being scientists looking for portals to other worlds and dimensions. It also alters the ending: after running out of fuel, the survivors agree to commit suicide after seeing the mist seemingly overrun New England. David Drayton kills the others, including his son. However, he does not have enough bullets to kill himself. As he steps out of the car to await his fate, the mist begins to disperse to reveal a US Army convoy approaching, destroying the remaining creatures and assisting survivors. David falls to his knees, realizing that they were only moments from rescue.

===Games===
* In 1985, Mindscape released an interactive fiction computer game based on the novella.
*The developers of the &quot;Half-Life&quot; video game series, which also deals with creatures from parallel dimensions breaking through to ours, have listed &quot;The Mist&quot; among their primary influences for the game plot. The first game in the series was originally going to be called &quot;Quiver&quot;, as a reference to the Arrowhead Project from &quot;The Mist&quot;.
*The &quot;Silent Hill&quot; video game series bears many similarities to &quot;The Mist&quot;. Series composer and producer Akira Yamaoka has cited the novella as a &quot;great source of inspiration&quot; for the development of the original Silent Hill game.

===Television adaptation===
* &quot;The Mist&quot;, a television series based on the novel, premiered on Spike on June 22, 2017. The series features cast members Morgan Spector, Alyssa Sutherland, Gus Birney, Danica Curcic and Frances Conroy. Spike cancelled the series on September 27, 2017, after just one season.

<doc id="534426" wikidata="Q7923600" url="?curid=534426" title="Veterans' affairs">
<text>Veterans&#x27; affairs is an area of public policy concerned with relations between a government and its communities of military veterans. Some jurisdictions have a designated government agency or department, a Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs, Ministry of Veterans&#x27; Affairs, Department of Veterans Services, or the like, which oversees issues relating to veterans&#x27; affairs. These departments provide a variety of services for veterans.

==Functions==
The particular services provided can vary by jurisdiction, but can include things such as:

* Resolving issues regarding compensation due following service
* Provision of military pensions
* Assistance with housing
* Assistance obtaining post-service employment
* Provision of treatment for service-related injuries
* Arranging for burial in cemeteries designated for veterans

In a survey of benefits and services offered to Veterans in four English-speaking countries, Veterans Affairs Canada noted that &quot;[w]hile each country&#x27;s suite of programs is very different, there is general consistency in the services and benefits available to support a Veteran&#x27;s re-establishment&quot;.

<doc id="534429" wikidata="Q2915358" url="?curid=534429" title="Frank Dux">
<text>Frank William Dux (; born April 6, 1956) is a Canadian-American martial artist and fight choreographer. According to Dux, a ninjutsu expert named Senzo Tanaka trained him as a ninja when he was a teenager. He established his own school of ninjutsu called Dux Ryu Ninjutsu, and has said he won a secret martial arts tournament called the Kumite in 1975. His alleged victory at the Kumite served as the inspiration for the 1988 film &quot;Bloodsport&quot; starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Dux&#x27;s victory at the Kumite has been disputed, as has the existence of both the Kumite he described and Senzo Tanaka.

Dux served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from 1975 to 1981, and claims he was sent on covert missions to Southeast Asia and awarded the Medal of Honor. He also asserts he was recruited by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director William J. Casey to work as a covert agent. His military records, however, show he was never sent overseas and has not received any awards; Dux states the military sabotaged his records to discredit him. He has been accused of falsifying his military service by authors B.G. Burkett, Ralph Keyes and Nigel West, and his claim to have worked for the CIA has been dismissed by Director of Central Intelligence Robert Gates, General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr., Major General John K. Singlaub, and &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; magazine.

Dux worked as a fight choreographer for &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, &quot;Lionheart&quot; (1990) and &quot;Only the Strong&quot; (1993). He detailed his alleged work for the CIA in the book &quot;The Secret Man&quot; in 1996, and that same year co-wrote the story for the film &quot;The Quest&quot; alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme. He sued Van Damme for breach of contract over the film, but lost the suit in 1998. He also lost a lawsuit against &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; for libel the following year, over their claims he had falsified his military and CIA service.

==Early life==
Dux was born on April 6, 1956, in Toronto, Canada. His family relocated from Ontario to Los Angeles, California when he was seven, and he later attended Grant High School. Dux states that he was introduced to and trained in ninjutsu by Senzo &quot;Tiger&quot; Tanaka, whom he described as a &quot;world-famous&quot; teacher and the descendant of 40 generations of warriors. Dux says that Tanaka brought him to Masuda, Japan, when he was 16, to train him as a ninja.

==Career==
Dux served in the United States Marine Corps Reserve from 1975 to 1981, and claimed he was sent on covert missions in Southeast Asia during this time. He also claimed he was awarded the Medal of Honor. Dux wrote articles for the September and October 1980 issues of &quot;Black Belt&quot; magazine, giving advice on martial arts techniques including knife fighting. He was described as being &quot;decorated for his blade fighting techniques in actual combat in Southeast Asia&quot; and as holding black belts in &quot;Taekwondo and other arts&quot;. He also co-authored an article on knife fighting for &quot;Inside Kung Fu&quot; magazine in 1987.

In 1980, Dux was interviewed by John Stewart from &quot;Black Belt&quot;, stating that he participated in a 1975 martial arts competition in The Bahamas called the Kumite, describing the event as a 60-round single-elimination tournament held in secret every five years. According to Dux, he was the first person to be given permission to speak publicly about the event, and was the first Westerner to win the tournament, achieving several world records there including the most consecutive knock-outs (56) and the fastest knockout punch (0.12 seconds). The 1988 film &quot;Bloodsport&quot; is based on his alleged Kumite victory. At the time of the film&#x27;s release, he was operating martial arts schools in Woodland Hills and North Hollywood, Los Angeles, teaching his own martial art style, Dux Ryu ninjutsu, which is based on the Koga Ninja root principles of Ko-ryū, &quot;adaptability and consistent change&quot;. Dux worked as the fight coordinator for &quot;Bloodsport&quot; and also for the 1990 film &quot;Lionheart&quot; and the 1993 film &quot;Only the Strong&quot;.

In 1993, Dux attended the 2nd annual Draka Martial Arts Trade Show in Los Angeles, where he had a confrontation with kickboxer Zane Frazier. Dux had previously hired Frazier to teach classes for him, though Frazier alleges that Dux never paid him. A fight ensued, with Frazier proving victorious. Rorion Gracie and Art Davie witnessed the fight and subsequently offered Frazier a position in the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Dux states that Frazier sucker punched him while wearing brass knuckles, in contradiction to multiple sources, including mixed martial arts (MMA) referee John McCarthy, who make no mention of this in their accounts of the fight.

Dux released the book &quot;The Secret Man: An American Warrior&#x27;s Uncensored Story&quot; in 1996. In the book, Dux states that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director William J. Casey arranged to meet him in a restroom, and recruited him to work on covert missions, including destroying a fuel depot in Nicaragua and a chemical weapons plant in Iraq.

Alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dux was a co-author of the 1996 film &quot;The Quest&quot;. Dux sued Van Damme after the film&#x27;s release for breach of contract, on the grounds the finished film was too similar to the manuscript &quot;Enter the New Dragon&quot;, which the two had also written. In 1998, Dux lost the case, with the jury foreman stating jurors found Dux&#x27;s testimony &quot;less than credible&quot;, including his assertion that audiotapes of his agreement with Van Damme were destroyed in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Dux appealed the verdict, though his appeal was dismissed in 1999.

==Disputed claims==

===Military service and Medal of Honor===

Contrary to his claims, Dux&#x27;s military records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act show that he never served overseas, that he has not been given the Medal of Honor or any other award, and that in January 1978 he was referred for psychiatric evaluation after he expressed &quot;flighty and disconnected ideas&quot;. Dux states that the military sabotaged his service record to discredit him. A photograph of Dux in military uniform shows service ribbons being displayed in an incorrect order, and the Medal of Honor he is wearing is the version given to members of the United States Army, rather than the Marine Corps. Questioned about the photograph in 1988, Dux told John Johnson from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; he was not able to get the military to explain why he was awarded a medal from the wrong service, though in later years he changed his story to say the uniform was just a Halloween costume. 

In his book &quot;Stolen Valor&quot;, which won the Colby Award in 2000, B.G. Burkett says that Dux fabricated his military history and awards, and had not served in Vietnam, noting the war had ended before he enlisted. Dux responded to the allegations by saying he never claimed to have served in Vietnam, only in covert missions in Southeast Asia, though, in 1980, he was described in &quot;Black Belt&quot; as having &quot;a distinguished military record during the Vietnam conflict&quot;, and an interview with him in a 1987 issue of &quot;Inside Kung Fu&quot; describes him as a Vietnam veteran. Authors Ralph Keyes and Nigel West have also disputed Dux&#x27;s military service, as has &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; magazine. In 2012, Sheldon Lettich, co-writer of &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, said that Dux originally showed him a Medal of Honor he claimed to have been awarded, though years later, after people began questioning if he had &quot;won&quot; the medal, Dux then tried to convince him he had never made such a claim.

===Kumite===
When interviewed by John Johnson in 1988, John Stewart expressed regret for writing the &quot;Black Belt&quot; article on Dux&#x27;s alleged Kumite victory. He described himself as naive for believing Dux, saying that after the story was published he received information that &quot;raised questions about Dux&#x27;s military career&quot;. Jim Coleman, then editor of &quot;Black Belt&quot;, added that Dux&#x27;s story was &quot;based on false premises&quot; and there was no evidence of the Kumite. Kenneth Wilson from the Ministry of Sports in The Bahamas disputed the existence of the Kumite, saying it was impossible a martial arts tournament of that scale could have been kept a secret. According to Johnson, an invoice for the organization that allegedly staged the Kumite listed Dux as its only point of contact, and the base of the trophy he claims to have won was bought by him at a local trophy store. Dux told Johnson to speak to a man named Richard Robinson, whom he said he had met at the Kumite. Robinson initially confirmed Dux&#x27;s story, saying that he was invited to the Kumite as he was an undefeated wrestler at Lower Merion High School. Johnson later uncovered that Robinson had not attended that school, and had actually gone to school with Dux. Confronted with this information, Robinson responded &quot;All right. I don&#x27;t know what to say ... Frank was a buddy of mine when I was in L.A.&quot; 

Sheldon Lettich said that he got the idea for &quot;Bloodsport&quot; after listening to Dux&#x27;s &quot;tall tales&quot; regarding the Kumite. Dux introduced him to a man named Richard Bender who claimed to have been at the Kumite and verified the story, though a few years later confessed to Lettich that he had been lying and that Dux had instructed him on what to say. Lettich described Dux as a &quot;delusional day-dreamer&quot;. Citing his Kumite claims, MMA website Fightland includes Dux among their list of martial arts frauds. Both John Johnson and Fightland believe Dux faked his story to help promote his martial arts schools.

===Senzo &quot;Tiger&quot; Tanaka===
John Johnson reported he could find no evidence of Dux&#x27;s alleged teacher Senzo &quot;Tiger&quot; Tanaka in history books or from other martial arts experts. Dux told Johnson he did not know the whereabouts of Tanaka or even if he was still alive, though in later years changed his story to say it was Tanaka&#x27;s dying wish for him to compete in the Kumite. When Johnson pointed out that Dux&#x27;s teacher has the same name as a ninja commander from Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond novel &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, Dux responded by saying that Fleming &quot;used to base his characters on real people&quot;. In March 2017, Dux wrote an article saying he had found Tanaka&#x27;s death certificate, which showed he had died in Los Angeles in 1975, though as of 2016 Dux&#x27;s website said that Tanaka died in Japan.

===Fight record===
In 1980, Dux told &quot;Black Belt&quot; that his fight record so far was 321 wins, one loss and seven draws, though in 2014 he told AXS TV that he had retired with a fight record of 329 wins, zero losses. Curtis Wong, an editor of &quot;Inside Kung Fu&quot;, doubted whether Dux&#x27;s alleged 56 consecutive knockout record was possible. Others observe the difficulty in proving or disproving Dux&#x27;s &quot;impossibly impressive&quot; records, as &quot;the only person able to verify any of this information is Dux himself&quot;.

===CIA work and &quot;The Secret Man&quot;===
Several notable figures refuted Dux&#x27;s claims in his book &quot;The Secret Man&quot; to have worked for the CIA. Robert Gates, William J. Casey&#x27;s deputy and successor, said he had never heard of Dux, nor had anyone else he knew in the CIA. Dux named General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Major-General John K. Singlaub as other people he had worked for, both of whom denied Dux&#x27;s assertions. Singlaub called the book, &quot;virtually a complete fabrication.&quot; He had his lawyer write to HarperCollins, the company that owned the imprint ReganBooks which published the book, asking for it to be recalled. &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; opined there were at least ten logical inconsistencies in the book, such as Dux&#x27;s &quot;preposterous&quot; claim that Casey personally handled his operations and ensured that no one else in the CIA would know of his existence, yet contradicts this by describing receiving documents and support from other personnel on numerous occasions. A CIA spokesman said the book was, &quot;sheer fantasy,&quot; adding that it was unusual for the CIA to comment on such matters though Dux&#x27;s claims were, &quot;so preposterous that we thought it was necessary,&quot; also stating that it was convenient for Dux that Casey was dead and unable to refute the book himself. Reviewing the book, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to tell whether the author is merely posturing or expressing his fantasy life in a memoir that reads as if patterned on the early paperback Avenger series.&quot;

Dux also alleged in the book that his father Alfred had worked for Mossad before the Second World War and also joined the Jewish Brigade in 1939. Nigel West says that Dux&#x27;s family history does not &quot;withstand much scrutiny&quot;, noting that Mossad was not formed until after the Second World War and that the Jewish Brigade was not formed until several years after Alfred is said to have joined it. Lieutenant Commander Larry Simmons, a novelist who formerly commanded SEAL Team 5 and who had the same literary agent as Dux, posed with Dux for a photograph. Dux featured the photo in the book, with the caption saying he was &quot;talking shop&quot; with the SEAL Team leader. Simmons denied &quot;talking shop&quot; with him, adding that Dux was &quot;not an American warrior. He is a con man.&quot;

===Other claims and reactions===

Writing in the book &quot;Action Speaks Louder&quot;, Eric Lichtenfield said that, when his exploits are questioned, Dux counters by &quot;actually exploiting his lack of substantiating evidence, and spinning it&quot; into even wilder stories. Dux says that the reason he no longer has a sword he was presented with at the Kumite is that he sold it in a failed attempt to buy the freedom of a boat of orphans whom he later rescued from pirates, that he stopped a plot to assassinate Steven Seagal, and that discrepancies in his martial arts history are the work of fabrications by his rivals including ninjutsu master Stephen K. Hayes.

While many sources dismiss Dux&#x27;s claims entirely, others believe there may be some truth to his stories. Dux sued &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; publisher Robert K. Brown for libel following the publication of their articles about him. While he eventually lost the case, during the hearing, John Johnson presented a photocopy of the receipt which he said proved that Dux had purchased his Kumite trophy, though the judge refused to allow it as evidence, noting several discrepancies such as the date on the receipt being after Dux was photographed with his trophy. Dariel Figueroa from &quot;Uproxx&quot; opined that there were several holes in both Dux&#x27;s claims, as well as those of some of his critics, &quot;leading to a mess of false evidence, lies, and, somewhere in the middle, the truth.&quot; Hugh Landman from &quot;Ranker&quot; has stated that while Dux &quot;lies about, or at least greatly exaggerates, many aspects of his career,&quot; that does not necessarily mean his story is entirely false, speculating he may have won a Kumite that was significantly different from the one that appears in &quot;Bloodsport&quot;.

<doc id="534430" wikidata="Q1040783" url="?curid=534430" title="Carl &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Switzer">
<text>Carl Dean Switzer (August 7, 1927 – January 21, 1959) was an American child actor, comic singer, dog breeder, and guide. He was best known for his role as Alfalfa in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series of short-subject comedies.

Switzer (rhyming with &quot;Schweitzer&quot;, as referenced in the 1939 film &quot;Alfalfa&#x27;s Aunt&quot;) began his career as a child actor in 1934. He appeared in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts as Alfalfa, one of the series&#x27; most popular and best-remembered characters. After outgrowing the series in 1940, Switzer struggled to find substantial roles, but was typecast as a juvenile actor. As an adult, he appeared mainly in bit parts and B-movies. He later became a dog breeder and hunting guide.

Switzer married heiress Diantha Collingwood in 1954 and they had one son. He was shot and killed by Moses &quot;Bud&quot; Stiltz in 1959 due to a disagreement regarding a business arrangement.

==Early life and family==
Carl Switzer was born in Paris, Illinois on August 7, 1927, the youngest of four children born to Gladys Carrie Shanks (1904–1997) and George Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; Switzer (1905–1960). Gladys and Fred&#x27;s first child, a brother, died in 1922, an hour and a half after being born. Carl&#x27;s sister Janice Switzer was born in 1923 and his brother Harold Switzer was born in 1925. He and Harold became famous in their hometown for their musical talent and performances. Both sang and could play a number of instruments.

==Career==

===&quot;Our Gang&quot;===
In 1934, the Switzers traveled to California to visit family. While sightseeing, they went to Hal Roach Studios. Following a public tour, eight-year-old Harold and six-year-old Carl entered the Hal Roach Studio&#x27;s open-to-the-public cafeteria, the &quot;Our Gang&quot; Café, and began an impromptu performance. Producer Hal Roach was present and was impressed. He signed both brothers to appear in &quot;Our Gang&quot;. Harold was given two nicknames, &quot;Slim&quot; and &quot;Deadpan&quot;, while Carl was dubbed &quot;Alfalfa&quot;.

The brothers first appeared in the 1935 &quot;Our Gang&quot; short &quot;Beginner&#x27;s Luck&quot;. By the end of the year, Alfalfa was one of the main characters, with a distinctive cowlick hairstyle, while Harold had been relegated to the background. Although Carl was an experienced singer and musician, his character Alfalfa was often called upon to sing popular songs for comic effect, most often those of Bing Crosby and Pinky Tomlin. The comic effect was achieved by playing the musical accompaniment slightly beyond the young singer&#x27;s range, so Switzer would struggle to reach the high notes -- resulting in squeaky, off-key tones.

By the end of 1937, Switzer&#x27;s &quot;Alfalfa&quot; had surpassed the series&#x27; nominal star, George &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarland, in popularity. While the boys got along, their fathers argued constantly over their sons&#x27; screen time and salaries. Switzer&#x27;s best friend among the &quot;Our Gang&quot; actors was Tommy Bond, who played his on-screen nemesis &quot;Butch&quot;. In Bond&#x27;s words, he and Switzer became good friends because &quot;neither of us could replace the others&quot;.

===Adult years===
Switzer&#x27;s tenure in &quot;Our Gang&quot; ended in 1940, when he was twelve. His first role after leaving the series was as a boy scout in &quot;I Love You Again&quot; (1940) starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. He then co-starred in the 1941 comedy &quot;Reg&#x27;lar Fellers&quot;. The next year, he had a supporting role in &quot;Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch&quot;. Switzer continued to appear in films in various supporting roles, including in &quot;Johnny Doughboy&quot; (1942), &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; (1943), &quot;Going My Way&quot; (1944), and &quot;The Great Mike&quot; (1944).

Switzer&#x27;s last starring roles were in a brief series of imitation &quot;Bowery Boys&quot; films. He reprised his &quot;Alfalfa&quot; character, complete with comically sour vocals, in PRC&#x27;s Gas House Kids comedies in 1946 and 1947. The Gas House Kids might have continued indefinitely, but the PRC studio was absorbed by the Eagle-Lion company in August 1947, ending the series. By this time Switzer was downplaying his earlier &quot;Our Gang&quot; work. In his 1946 resumé, he referred to the films generically as &quot;M-G-M short product&quot;.

Switzer had small parts in both the 1946 Christmas film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; as Donna Reed&#x27;s date at a high school dance, and again in the 1948 film &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot; as the mayor&#x27;s trumpet-playing son in a fixed musical talent contest. In 1952, he played a busboy in the film &quot;Pat and Mike&quot; starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. In the 1954 musical film &quot;White Christmas&quot;, only his photograph was used: he appeared in costume as &quot;Freckle-Faced Haynes, the Dog-Faced Boy&quot;, an army buddy of Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye).

In the 1950s, Switzer returned to television. Between 1952 and 1955, he made six appearances on &quot;The Roy Rogers Show&quot;. He also guest-starred in an episode of the American science fiction anthology series &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot; and &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;. In 1953 and 1954, Switzer co-starred in three William A. Wellman-directed films: &quot;Island in the Sky&quot; and &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;, both starring John Wayne, and &quot;Track of the Cat&quot;, starring Robert Mitchum. Switzer himself was impressed by the &quot;Track of the Cat&quot; assignment, in which he played a white-haired Native American: it was the first time he had been called upon to play an adult character role. In 1955 he was featured (but not credited) in the Bowery Boys comedy &quot;Dig That Uranium&quot;, reuniting him with former Gas House Kids teammate Bennie Bartlett. Switzer had a bit part as a Hebrew slave in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;. Switzer&#x27;s final film role was in the 1958 drama &quot;The Defiant Ones&quot;.

==Personal life==
Offscreen, Switzer bred and trained hunting dogs and guided hunting expeditions. Among his notable clients were Roy Rogers and Dale Evans (godparents of Switzer&#x27;s son), James Stewart, and Henry Fonda.

In early 1954, Switzer went on a blind date with Diantha Collingwood (1930–2004), also known as Dian or Diana. She was the daughter of Lelo and Faye Collingwood, and an heiress to the grain elevator empire Collingwood Grain. Collingwood had moved with her mother and sister to California in 1953 because her sister wanted to become an actress. Switzer and Collingwood got along well and married in Las Vegas three months later.

In 1956, with his money running out and Diantha pregnant, his mother-in-law offered them a farm near Pretty Prairie, Kansas. Their son, Justin Lance Collingwood Switzer (later Justin Lance Collingwood Eldridge) was born that year. They divorced in 1957. Diantha married Richard Rosswell &quot;Ross&quot; Eldridge (1933–2007), who adopted and raised Lance as his own, and had two other children by him, sons Chris and Lee Eldridge.

In 1987, former &quot;Our Gang&quot; co-star George &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarland recalled a meeting with Switzer when they spoke about the farm:

On January 26, 1958, Switzer was getting into his car in front of a bar in Studio City, when a bullet smashed through the window and struck him in the upper right arm. However, the gunman was never caught. Later that December, Switzer was arrested in Sequoia National Forest for cutting down 15 pine trees he had intended to sell illegally as Christmas trees. He was sentenced to one year&#x27;s probation. Switzer was also ordered to pay a $225 fine (more than $ today).

==Death==
Sometime in 1959, Switzer agreed to train a hunting dog, a Treeing Walker Coonhound, for Moses Samuel &quot;Bud&quot; Stiltz. Stiltz was Switzer&#x27;s longtime friend and sometime business partner, whom Switzer had met while working with Roy Rogers on various productions at the Corriganville Movie Ranch. The dog, while in Switzer&#x27;s possession, ran off to chase after a bear and disappeared. After learning that the dog had been lost while in Switzer&#x27;s care, Stiltz demanded that Switzer had to either return his dog or pay him the equivalent of the dog&#x27;s value.

Switzer was then working as a bartender. Unable to produce the money to settle the debt, Switzer took out ads in newspapers and put up fliers, offering a reward for the safe return of the animal. Eventually, the dog was located and brought to the bar where Switzer was working. Switzer rewarded the rescuer with $35 in cash and $15 in drinks (). Switzer was annoyed by the cash outlay; a few days later, in an emotional conversation with his friend Jack Piott, a 37-year-old unit still photographer, the two decided that Stiltz should reimburse Switzer the finder&#x27;s fee. Their argument was that the dog was Stiltz&#x27;s and not Switzer&#x27;s.

The two arrived at Stiltz&#x27;s home in Mission Hills, at 10400 Columbus Avenue. Stiltz shared the home with his wife, Rita Corrigan, and his stepchildren. Switzer and Piott intended to demand money from Stiltz. Though differing accounts of the event exist, all agree that Stiltz was struck over the left side of his head with a glass clock. He later retreated to his room to retrieve a .38-caliber revolver, and Switzer tried to wrestle the gun from him. Their struggle caused the gun to discharge and almost shot Tom Corrigan, Stiltz&#x27;s 14-year-old stepson. Stiltz regained the weapon and shot Switzer.

Stiltz&#x27;s account of the event was one of self-defense, testifying that Switzer had banged on his front door, yelling &quot;Let me in, or I&#x27;ll kick in the door.&quot; The threat was followed by a struggle that began with one of the men, Switzer or Piott, striking Stiltz with the clock. This prompted Stiltz to retrieve his firearm. According to Stiltz, Switzer threatened him with a knife and yelled, &quot;I&#x27;m going to kill you!&quot; Stiltz fired and shot Switzer in the groin, damaging an artery that caused massive internal bleeding. Switzer was pronounced dead on arrival at 7:27 pm at the hospital at the age of 31.

Tom Corrigan&#x27;s account differed significantly from his stepfather&#x27;s. He told investigators that Stiltz shot Switzer as he and Piott were leaving. After the gun&#x27;s accidental discharge that almost hit Corrigan, Switzer turned to Piott and said they needed to leave. The two were headed for the door when Stiltz then fired the fatal shot. Switzer never drew a knife, as Stiltz had claimed he had.

Corrigan was never called to testify at the coroner&#x27;s inquest, and Stiltz testified in his own favor. His testimony was taken to be truthful, despite physical evidence that contradicted his account and his past perjury conviction. Years later, Corrigan stood by what he told officers had happened that night, and said his stepfather did not have to kill Switzer.

===Later accounts===
The shooting was judged to be self-defense. During the inquest regarding Switzer&#x27;s death, it was revealed that what was reported as a &quot;hunting knife&quot; was in fact a penknife. It had been found by crime scene investigators under his body.

Over 42 years later, in January 2001, Tom Corrigan told reporters &quot;It was more like murder&quot;. He said he heard the knock on the front door, and Switzer said &quot;Western Union for Bud Stiltz.&quot; Corrigan&#x27;s mother, Rita Corrigan, opened the door to find a drunk Switzer, complaining about a perceived month-old debt and demanding repayment. Corrigan said Switzer entered the house first, followed by Jack Piott. Switzer said he was going to beat up Stiltz, and Stiltz confronted Switzer with a .38-caliber revolver in his hand.

Corrigan said that Switzer grabbed the revolver and Stiltz and Switzer struggled over it. He said Piott broke a glass-domed clock over Stiltz&#x27;s head, causing Stiltz&#x27;s eye to swell shut. During the struggle, a shot was fired into the ceiling and Corrigan was struck in the leg by a fragment. Corrigan said his two younger sisters ran to a neighbor&#x27;s house to call for help. &quot;Well, we shot Tommy, enough of this,&quot; he said he recalled Switzer saying, just before Switzer and Piott started to leave the house.

Corrigan said he had just stepped out the front door when he heard, but did not witness, a second shot behind him. He said he then turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with a surprised look on his face after Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer&#x27;s side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He said he then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. Corrigan said they heard emergency sirens as Piott begged for his life, and that he thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner&#x27;s jury.

Corrigan said a Los Angeles Police Department detective interviewed him and asked if he would testify before the judge. Corrigan said he agreed to, but he was never called before the court.

Moses Stiltz died in 1983 at the age of 62.

===Burial===
Carl Switzer was interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California on January 27, 1959. Because he died the same day as Cecil B. DeMille, his death received only minor notice in most newspapers, as DeMille&#x27;s obituary dominated the columns. Switzer had appeared as a slave (uncredited) in one of the last films for which DeMille was credited as a producer, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.

Switzer&#x27;s gravestone features the square and compasses of Freemasonry and an image of a hunting dog.

<text>Peleliu (or Beliliou) is an island in the island nation of Palau. Peleliu, along with two small islands to its northeast, forms one of the sixteen states of Palau. The island is notable as the location of the Battle of Peleliu in World War II.

== History ==
Beliliou was traditionally divided into five villages. Teliu is located on the southwest coast bordered on the north by Ngerkeiukl on the west coast, Ngesias in the central portion of the island, and Ngerdelolk on the east coast. Ngerchol occupies the northern part of the island on the west side of Bloody Nose Ridge. Most of the surface remains of the traditional villages have been obliterated. However, the locations of the villages and the locations of features within the villages, including odesongel, are known and preserved in the oral tradition. These traditional features are important symbols giving identity to families, clans and regions.

The lagoon and adjacent rock islands are important resource areas, and probably were intensively exploited prehistorically. Important resources include many different species of trees and other plants and many different species of fish and shellfish. On the islands, traditional gardens would have been located in areas where sufficient soil had accumulated in low lying pockets and marshes.

First sighting of Peleliu, Babeldaob, and Koror recorded by Westerners was by the Spanish expedition of Ruy López de Villalobos at the end of January 1543. They were then charted as &quot;Los Arrecifes&quot; (&quot;The Reefs&quot; in Spanish). In November and December 1710 these three islands were again visited and explored by the Spanish missionary expedition commanded by Sargento Mayor Francisco Padilla on board of the patache &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;. Two years later they were explored in detail by the expedition of Spanish naval officer Bernardo de Egoy.
Following its defeat in the Spanish–American War, Spain sold Palau (including Peleliu) to Germany in 1899. Control passed to Japan in 1914.

During World War II, the Battle of Peleliu was a major battle between units of the United States Marine Corps and United States Army against the Imperial Japanese Army in 1944. The battle for the island was particularly brutal because by this time the Japanese military had evolved island defense tactics with strong fortifications in the island&#x27;s caves and rock formations within the Umurbrogol Mountains (Bloody Nose Ridge), which enabled a defense in depth which maximized casualties on the attacking force. On both sides involved in the fighting there were high losses with more than 2,000 Americans and 10,000 Japanese killed, but, remarkably, there were no casualties among the local civilians because they were evacuated from the fighting to other islands of Palau.

The ruins of many of the military installations of the era, such as the airstrip, are still intact, and shipwrecks from the battle remain visible underwater just off the coast. There are war memorials on the island to both the American and the Japanese dead. Peleliu and Angaur were the only islands in the Palau archipelago to be occupied by the Americans during the war. The capital of Koror remained in Japanese hands to the end of the war.

Peleliu was formally placed under the control of the United States under United Nations auspices in 1947 as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. In 1947, two and a half years after Japanese surrender, there were over 30 Japanese still hiding in caves, believing the war was not over. The Americans sent a senior Japanese military official into the caves and convinced them to surrender. The last Japanese survivor, Keiji Nagai, died in 2019. 

Palau became independent in 1978, and Peleliu was organized as a state within the new republic. In August 2014, Peleliu hosted the &quot;leader&#x27;s retreat&quot; at the 45th Pacific Islands Forum, featuring representatives from the forum&#x27;s 15 member states.

==Geography==

Peleliu is approximately northeast of the island of Angaur and southwest of the island of Koror. The state of Beliliou includes the islands of Beliliou, Ngedbus, Olngeuaol, Ngercheu, Belualasmau, Ruruid, Ngebad, Ngurungor, Ngesuall, and several islets. The total area for the state is approximately . Beliliou Island, like Angaur, is a raised platform coralline island with an area of . Located at the southern tip of the lagoon which encircles the main group of islands, Beliliou is surrounded by a thick fringe of mangrove forest comprising more than a quarter of its total area. On the island&#x27;s west side is a steep spine named Bloody Nose Ridge during the Battle for Peleliu in World War II - rising to an elevation of . A second raised area, Rois ra Sang and Roischemiangel, rises to elevations of just over 50 m at the northern tip of the island. The rest of the island generally lies below in elevation. Along this ridge, jagged spires of coralline limestone jut skyward in a tangled maze.

Much of Beliliou is covered by a limestone island forest with stands of Casuarina forest along sandy beach berms. With the exception of Ngercheu, the rest of the islands in the state are low, flat islands with large areas of sandy deposits covered by coconut or Casuarina forests. Ngercheu, located in the northern part of the state, has a typical rock island profile with steep cliffs of uplifted reef covered by a rock island forest.

The geography of Beliliou has been dramatically reshaped by the events of World War II. In preparation for the anticipated American invasion, the Japanese defenders transformed Beliliou into a defensive fortress. The build up, which was underway by 1943, began with the evacuation of Palauans from Beliliou to Babeldaob. As many as 10,000 Japanese defenders dug into the natural caves and fissures of the coralline limestone formations, reinforcing these positions with concrete bunkers. So well established were the Japanese defenders that they withstood a massive naval bombardment and met the American invasion force at nearly full strength on September 5, 1944. The Battle of Peleliu, which proved in hindsight to be a costly miscalculation by the Americans, dragged on for weeks of bitter fighting at a terrible cost of lives.

Most of the land use in Beliliou today is for private gardens located in and around residential areas. There are no commercial enterprises active today, and municipal use is limited to a few small facilities. A large coconut plantation is on Ngedbus Island.

== Demography ==
The population of the state was 484 in the 2015 census and median age was 34.5 years. The official languages of the state are Palauan and English.

In June 1972, the resident population was 843. , its population was about 571, making it the third most populous state of Palau. Most of the island&#x27;s population lives in the village of Kloulklubed which is the state capital on the northwestern coast. Including the capital, there are a total of four villages:

* Kloulklubed (northwest)
* Imelechol (northeast)
* Lademisang (southernmost, in the central part of the island)
* Ongeuidel (northernmost)
Today, the major concentration of people live in Kloulklubed near the northern tip of the island.

=== Islands of the state ===
The state consists of the following islands:

=== Phosphate ===
As at Angaur, phosphate mining in the Bloody Nose Ridge area of Beliliou began during the German administration and continued into the Japanese administration. The phosphate was loaded onto ships at a small harbor facility located at the northern tip of the island.

==Environment==
===Important Bird Areas===
The island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of most of Palau&#x27;s endemic birds, including Micronesian megapodes, Palau ground doves, Micronesian imperial pigeons, Palau fruit doves, swiftlets, owls and kingfishers, Micronesian myzomelas, morningbirds, Palau fantails, flycatchers and bush warblers, giant, dusky and citrine white-eyes, and Micronesian starlings.

The sandflats, mangroves, seagrass beds and islets just off the northern end of Peleliu provide feeding and roosting habitat for various wader species, as well as being home to megapodes. The site is an IBA for the megapodes, Far Eastern curlews, ruddy turnstones, great knots, red-necked stints, and grey-tailed tattlers.

==Political system==
Peleliu has its own constitution, adopted in 1982. The state government was established in 1983. The state of Peleliu has an elected chief executive with a 3-year term length, known as the governor. The state also has a legislature elected every three years. The state population elects one of the members of the House of Delegates of Palau. Obak is the title of the traditional high chief from the state.

==Transport==
Peleliu Airfield, created by the Japanese in World War II, has the longest and widest runway in Palau (), but was used only by small chartered aircraft after Palau&#x27;s domestic flights were discontinued in late 2005. The landing strip was built during the Japanese era and originally consisted of a 6,600-foot runway oriented SW to NE with a smaller perpendicular runway intersecting the main run way about 2,200 feet from the SW. Additional taxiways connected the runways to airport facilities located to the north of the runways. The landing strips were unimproved, but still served for the daily flight from the Airai airport by a single engine plane. A third landing strip was built on Ngedbus Island, just north of Beliliou, during the Japanese administration. It was abandoned after the Battle of Peleliu and today is overgrown with a coconut plantation. In any event, in mid-2024 after months of work, U.S. Marine engineers reactivated the Peleliu airfield to enhance US military capability in the Pacific region.

A regular boat service connects the island twice a week to Koror and Angaur. Travel time by boat from Koror is over an hour. The small harbor in the far north of the island is shallow and suitable only for yachts with shallow draft.

The main road lies on the west side of Bloody Nose Ridge and extends from Kloulklubed to the landing strip. Secondary roads extend to all parts of the island.

==Peleliu Battlefield==

The entire island has been listed in the United States on the National Register of Historic Places as the Peleliu Battlefield, and has been designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark.

== Education==
The Ministry of Education operates public schools.

Peleliu Elementary School opened in 1946, and had its second building open in 1966, with the first still in use.

Palau High School in Koror is the country&#x27;s only public high school, so children from this community go there.

<doc id="534433" wikidata="Q2373760" url="?curid=534433" title="Kenneth D. Taylor">
<text>Kenneth Douglas Taylor (October 5, 1934 – October 15, 2015) was a Canadian diplomat, educator and businessman, best known for his role in the 1979 covert operation called the &quot;Canadian Caper&quot; when he was the Canadian ambassador to Iran. With the cooperation of the American Central Intelligence Agency, Taylor helped six Americans escape from Iran during the Iran hostage crisis by procuring Canadian passports for the Americans to deceive the Iranian Revolutionary guard by posing as a Canadian film crew scouting locations. Had the IRG known, every Canadian in the embassy would have been executed. Before the escape, the six Americans spent several weeks hiding in the homes of Taylor and another Canadian diplomat, John Sheardown.

Taylor is portrayed by Gordon Pinsent in the Canadian 1981 television film, &quot;Escape from Iran: The Canadian Caper&quot; which dramatizes the cover story for the operation. The later 2012 American film, &quot;Argo&quot;, focuses more on the CIA and Hollywood&#x27;s role, with Taylor played by Canadian actor Victor Garber.

After his death, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Taylor as the &quot;main hero&quot; of the Iran hostage escape &quot;who orchestrated the entire process&quot;, quoting former president Jimmy Carter in doing so. In 1981, Taylor was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by President Ronald Reagan. Nonetheless, the significance of his role was downplayed in the film &quot;Argo&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Taylor was born in Calgary, Alberta. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree at Victoria College at the University of Toronto and his Master of Business Administration degree at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a brother of the Sigma Chi fraternity and was later honoured with its highest award, Significant Sigma Chi.

==Iran hostage crisis==
Iranian students invaded the United States embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979. During the riot, six Americans managed to escape. They hid for four days before reaching the Canadian embassy, where they met Taylor, who devised the plan to get them out of Iran safely. On January 20, 1981, as Ronald Reagan was being sworn in as President, the remaining 52 American hostages were released by Iran into US custody, having spent 444 days in captivity.

Taylor played a crucial role in providing intelligence on the hostage crisis to Canadian and American intelligence agencies. Reportedly, he helped scout out landing sites for the abortive Delta Force rescue attempt, Operation Eagle Claw. 

A made-for-TV movie of the events, &quot;Escape from Iran: The Canadian Caper&quot;, was produced in 1981. In 2012, Ben Affleck produced and starred in a movie titled &quot;Argo&quot;, which is based on the book &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; by Tony Mendez, a CIA agent involved in the incident. After the film was previewed at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, criticism arose that the film unfairly minimized the participation of the Canadian government, and Taylor in particular, in the extraction operation. This included the addition to the film of several fictional events for dramatic reasons, as well as a postscript text indicating that the CIA let Taylor take the credit for political purposes, implying that he did not deserve the accolades he received. Affleck noted, &quot;Because we say it&#x27;s based on a true story, rather than this is a true story, we&#x27;re allowed to take some dramatic license. There&#x27;s a spirit of truth.&quot; However, Affleck did respond by changing the postscript text to read, &quot;The involvement of the CIA complemented efforts of the Canadian embassy to free the six held in Tehran. To this day the story stands as an enduring model of international co-operation between governments.&quot; Historical news footage discussing Canada&#x27;s role in the rescue was also added near the end of the film. Taylor himself said that the film was &quot;fun, it&#x27;s thrilling, it&#x27;s pertinent, it&#x27;s timely,&quot; but noted that &quot;Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place. The CIA was a junior partner.&quot;

==Later life and death==
After returning from Iran, Taylor was appointed Canadian Consul-General to New York City. In 1980, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada along with his wife Pat and other Canadian personnel involved in the escape, and was also awarded the United States Congressional Gold Medal that same year. He also received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1980.

He returned to the University of Toronto for several years as the Chancellor of Victoria College.

Taylor left the foreign service in 1984 and served as Senior Vice-President of Nabisco (RJR Nabisco after 1986) from 1984 to 1989.

Taylor moved to the United States and resided in New York City until his death at the age of 81 on October 15, 2015. Taylor died at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, where he had been treated for Stage 4 colon cancer. Taylor&#x27;s funeral service was held at Timothy Eaton Memorial Church in Toronto on October 27, 2015. He was survived by his wife, Patricia, his son, Douglas, and two grandchildren, Tristan and Kassia.

== Notes and references ==
a. Taylor did not present credentials because of the Canadian government&#x27;s decision to change residency and accreditation from Iran to Kuwait, with the opening of a Canadian Embassy in Kuwait.

<doc id="534435" wikidata="Q280969" url="?curid=534435" title="Lateral line">
<text>The lateral line, also called the lateral line organ (LLO), is a system of sensory organs found in fish, used to detect movement, vibration, and pressure gradients in the surrounding water. The sensory ability is achieved via modified epithelial cells, known as hair cells, which respond to displacement caused by motion and transduce these signals into electrical impulses via excitatory synapses. Lateral lines play an important role in schooling behavior, predation, and orientation. 

Early in the evolution of fish, some of the sensory organs of the lateral line were modified to function as the electroreceptors called ampullae of Lorenzini. The lateral line system is ancient and basal to the vertebrate clade, as it is found in fishes that diverged over 400 million years ago.

== Function ==

The lateral line system allows the detection of movement, vibration, and pressure gradients in the water surrounding an animal. It plays an essential role in orientation, predation, and fish schooling by providing spatial awareness and the ability to navigate in the environment. Analysis has shown that the lateral line system should be an effective passive sensing system able to discriminate between submerged obstacles by their shape. The lateral line allows fish to navigate and hunt in water with poor visibility.

The lateral line system enables predatory fishes to detect vibrations made by their prey, and to orient towards the source to begin predatory action. Blinded predatory fishes remain able to hunt, but not when lateral line function is inhibited by cobalt ions.

The lateral line plays a role in fish schooling. Blinded &quot;Pollachius virens&quot; were able to integrate into a school, whereas fish with severed lateral lines could not. It may have evolved further to allow fish to forage in dark caves. In Mexican blind cave fish, &quot;Astyanax mexicanus&quot;, neuromasts in and around the orbit of the eye are bigger and around twice as sensitive as those of surface-living fish.

One function of schooling may be to confuse the lateral line of predatory fishes. A single prey fish creates a simple particle velocity pattern, whereas the pressure gradients of many closely swimming (schooling) prey fish overlap, creating a complex pattern. This makes it difficult for predatory fishes to identify individual prey through lateral line perception.

== Anatomy ==


Lateral lines are usually visible as faint lines of pores running along each side of a fish&#x27;s body. The functional units of the lateral line are the neuromasts, discrete mechanoreceptive organs that sense movement in water. There are two main varieties: canal neuromasts and superficial neuromasts. Superficial neuromasts are on the surface of the body, while canal neuromasts are along the lateral lines in subdermal, fluid-filled canals. Each neuromast consists of receptive hair cells whose tips are covered by a flexible jellylike cupula. Hair cells typically possess both glutamatergic afferent connections and cholinergic efferent connections. The receptive hair cells are modified epithelial cells; they typically possess bundles of 40–50 microvilli &quot;hairs&quot; which function as the mechanoreceptors. Within each bundle, the hairs are organized in a rough &quot;staircase&quot; from shortest to longest.&#x27;

== Signal transduction ==

The hair cells are stimulated by the deflection of their hair bundles in the direction of the tallest &quot;hairs&quot; or stereocilia. The deflection allows cations to enter through a mechanically gated channel, causing depolarization or hyperpolarization of the hair cell. Depolarization opens Cav1.3 calcium channels in the basolateral membrane. 

Hair cells use a system of transduction with rate coding to transmit the directionality of a stimulus. The hair cells produce a constant, tonic rate of firing. As mechanical motion is transmitted through water to the neuromast, the cupula bends and is displaced according to the strength of the stimulus. This results in a shift in the cell&#x27;s ionic permeability. Deflection towards the longest hair results in depolarization of the hair cell, increased neurotransmitter release at the excitatory afferent synapse, and a higher rate of signal transduction. Deflection towards the shorter hair has the opposite effect, hyperpolarizing the hair cell and producing a decreased rate of neurotransmitter release. These electrical impulses are then transmitted along afferent lateral neurons to the brain. 

While both varieties of neuromasts utilize this method of transduction, their specialized organization gives them different mechanoreceptive capacities. Superficial organs are exposed more directly to the external environment. The organization of the bundles within their organs is seemingly haphazard, incorporating various shapes and sizes of microvilli within bundles. This suggests coarse but wide-ranging detection. In contrast, the structure of canal organs allow canal neuromasts more sophisticated mechanoreception, such as of pressure differentials. As current moves across the pores, a pressure differential is created, inducing a flow in the canal fluid. This moves the cupulae of the neuromasts in the canal, resulting in a deflection of the hairs in the direction of the flow.

== Electrophysiology ==

The mechanoreceptive hair cells of the lateral line structure are integrated into more complex circuits through their afferent and efferent connections. The synapses that directly participate in the transduction of mechanical information are excitatory afferent connections that utilize glutamate. Species vary in their neuromast and afferent connections, providing differing mechanoreceptive properties. For instance, the superficial neuromasts of the midshipman fish, &quot;Porichthys notatus&quot;, are sensitive to specific stimulation frequencies. One variety is attuned to collect information about acceleration, at stimulation frequencies between 30 and 200 Hz. The other type obtains information about velocity, and is most receptive to stimulation below 30 Hz.

The efferent synapses to hair cells are inhibitory and use acetylcholine as a transmitter. They are crucial participants in a corollary discharge system designed to limit self-generated interference. When a fish moves, it creates disturbances in the water that could be detected by the lateral line system, potentially interfering with the detection of other biologically relevant signals. To prevent this, an efferent signal is sent to the hair cell upon motor action, resulting in inhibition which counteracts the excitation resulting from reception of the self-generated stimulation. This allows the fish to detect external stimuli without interference from its own movements. Some efferent projections to lateral line hair cells use dopamine as a transmitter, likely enhancing the activity of hair cell presynaptic calcium channels and thereby increasing neurotransmission. 

Signals from the hair cells are transmitted along lateral neurons to the brain. The area where these signals most often terminate is the medial octavolateralis nucleus (MON), which probably processes and integrates mechanoreceptive information. The deep MON contains distinct layers of basilar and non-basilar crest cells, suggesting computational pathways analogous to the electrosensory lateral line lobe of electric fish. The MON is likely involved in the integration of excitatory and inhibitory parallel circuits to interpret mechanoreceptive information.

== Evolution ==

The use of mechanosensitive hairs is homologous to the functioning of hair cells in the auditory and vestibular systems, indicating a close link between these systems. Due to many overlapping functions and their great similarity in ultrastructure and development, the lateral line system and the inner ear of fish are often grouped together as the octavolateralis system (OLS). Here, the lateral line system detects particle velocities and accelerations with frequencies below 100 Hz. These low frequencies create large wavelengths, which induce strong particle accelerations in the near field of swimming fish that do not radiate into the far field as acoustic waves due to an acoustic short circuit. The auditory system detects pressure fluctuations with frequencies above 100 Hz that propagate to the far field as waves.

The lateral line system is ancient and basal to the vertebrate clade; it is found in groups of fishes that diverged over 400 million years ago, including the lampreys, cartilaginous fishes, and bony fishes. Most amphibian larvae and some fully aquatic adult amphibians possess mechanosensitive systems comparable to the lateral line. The terrestrial tetrapods have secondarily lost their lateral line organs, which are ineffective when not submerged.

The electroreceptive organs, called ampullae of Lorenzini, appearing as pits in the skin of sharks and some other fishes, evolved from the lateral line organ. Passive electroreception using ampullae is an ancestral trait in the vertebrates, meaning that it was present in their last common ancestor.

<text>Wesel () is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is the capital of the Wesel district.

==Geography==
Wesel is situated at the confluence of the Lippe River and the Rhine.

===Division of the city===
Suburbs of Wesel include Lackhausen, Obrighoven, Ginderich, Feldmark, Fusternberg, Büderich, Flüren and Blumenkamp.

==History==

===Origin===
The city originated from a Franconian manor that was first recorded in the 8th century.
In the 12th century, the Duke of Clèves took possession of Wesel. The city became a member of the Hanseatic League during the 15th century. Wesel was second only to Cologne in the lower Rhine region as an entrepôt. It was an important commercial centre: a clearing station for the transshipment and trading of goods.

===Early modern===

In 1590 the Spanish captured Wesel after a four-year siege. The city changed hands between the Dutch and Spanish several times during the Eighty Years War. In 1672 a French force under Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé captured the city. Wesel was inherited by the Hohenzollerns of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1609 but they were unable to take control of Wesel until the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678. Although the city had been heavily fortified the Prussians evacuated the city during the Seven Years&#x27; War and it was occupied by the French. It was returned to Prussia at the end of the war. Friedrich Wilhelm von Dossow was the Prussian Governor of Wesel during the 18th century. Wesel was ceded to the French in 1805 under the Treaty of Schönbrunn. The French heavily fortified the city constructing a rectangular fort called the Citadelle Napoleon at Büderich and the Citadelle Bonaparte on an island in the Rhine off Wesel. Though blockaded by the Allies in 1813 the city remained in French hands until after the Battle of Waterloo. After the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century, the city became part of the Prussian Rhine Province and the Citadelle Napoleon was renamed Fort Blücher.

===World War II===
During World War II, as a strategic depot, Wesel became a target of Allied bombing. Air raids, using impact and air-burst bombs, on 16, 17, 18 and 19 February 1945, destroyed 97% of the town. The Wehrmacht blew up bridges along the Rhine and Lippe to prevent Allied forces from advancing. The Wehrmacht also destroyed the 1,950m-long railway bridge, the last Rhine bridge remaining in German hands, on 10 March. On 23 March, Wesel came under the fire of over 3,000 guns when it was bombarded anew, in preparation for Operation Plunder. The shelling was assisted by a raid of RAF bombers and a larger raid that night, during which ten individual bombers each dropped a 10,000 kg bomb on Wesel at 2100 hours. Before the town was finally taken by Allied troops, 97% of its structures were destroyed. In the ensuing attacks by Allied forces, the town was taken with minimal casualties. Operation Varsity the largest airborne landings of the war in one day and one location dropped 18,000 troops into the area to take the hills behind Wesel. The British 1st Commando Brigade was already attacking Wesel, carried into action by LVT Buffalos. The remainder of the Allied force crossed the Rhine in more amphibious vehicles.

From almost 25,000 in 1939, the population was reduced to 1,900 by May 1945. In 1946 Wesel became part of the new state North Rhine-Westphalia of West Germany.

<text>Unit 777 (), also known as Task Force 777, is a tier two special force in the Egyptian Army, falling under the El-Sa&#x27;ka Force. They specializes in black operations, commando style raids, counterterrorism, executive protection, hostage rescue, irregular warfare, manhunting, and special operations in behind enemy lines. It was created in 1978 by the government of Anwar Sadat in response to concerns of increased terrorist activity following the expulsion of Soviet military advisors from the country by Sadat and his efforts to achieve peace with Israel.

==Creation==
In 1978, Egyptian Army Special Forces were dispatched to Larnaca International Airport, Larnaca, Cyprus in response to the hijacking of a Cyprus Air passenger aircraft by operatives of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). Cairo merely informed Cypriot president Kyprianou that &quot;people are on the way to help rescue the hostages&quot; and did not reveal who was on board nor what their intentions were. Upon landing in Cyprus, the Egyptian force immediately launched an all-out assault, dispatching a single Jeep all-terrain vehicle with three men to race ahead of an estimated 58 troops (another report has this figure at 74) moving towards the hijacked aircraft on foot. As the Egyptian troops advanced quickly towards the hijacked DC-8 aircraft and the Cypriot special forces who surrounded it, the Cypriot special forces reportedly issued a single verbal warning to halt and submit, though in other reports, the Cypriots issued two verbal warnings, the second demand for the Egyptians to return to their aircraft. As this occurred, the occupants of the Jeep and the Cypriot operators exchanged gunfire, and the Egyptian Jeep was struck by a rocket propelled grenade (RPG), as well as gunfire, killing all three occupants. As the vehicle came to a halt, the Cypriots and the main Egyptian force confronted each other at a range of less than 300 metres (330 yd), and it is variously reported that the Egyptians, who lacked any form of cover, dropped down onto the tarmac in prone firing positions. At this moment, the two forces engaged each other with heavy gunfire, and the Cypriots opened fire on the Egyptian C-130H aircraft with a 106 mm anti-tank missile, striking it in the nose and killing the three crew on board.

With their aircraft destroyed, the Egyptian force and the Cypriot special forces exchanged heavy gunfire for nearly an hour in sporadic fighting on the open tarmac. Some of the Egyptian troops took cover in a nearby empty Air France aircraft.

Kyprianou, who was watching the events unfolding from the airport control tower, was forced to withdraw from the windows and take cover as Egyptian commandos shot at the tower with automatic gunfire. Of the Egyptian commando force, 15 men were killed, in addition to three crew of the C-130H Hercules transport aircraft who were killed when it was struck by a missile. An estimated 15 more Egyptian commandos were reported to have been taken injured to Larnaca General Hospital with gunshot wounds. No fatalities of Cypriot commandos were recorded. Following the assault, it emerged that the surrender of the two hostage-takers had already been secured at the time of the failed Egyptian attack, and the two men were taken prisoner by the Cypriots and later extradited to Egypt, where they received death sentences, later commuted to life sentences.The aftermath of the failed night-time incident and the need of a professional counter-terrorism unit in Egypt resulted in the creation of Unit 777.

==EgyptAir Flight 321==

On August 23, 1976, three armed terrorists claiming to be from the Abd Al-Nasir Movement hijacked the EgyptAir Flight 321, a Cairo-Luxor flight, and asked the pilot to land in Tripoli. One of the three hijackers was a 21-year-old Palestinian, Mohammed Naguid, who was working in Kuwait. They demanded the release of five Libyans imprisoned in Cairo in connection with two assassination attempts. The context was the deterioration of relations between Egypt and Libya after the Yom Kippur War due to Libyan opposition to Sadat&#x27;s peace policy. There had been a breakdown in unification talks between the two governments, which subsequently led to the Libyan-Egyptian War. Fifteen minutes after takeoff from Cairo International Airport, an Italian pilot called the airport to report that he had received a beam aerial from the Egyptian aircraft heading to Luxor that it had been hijacked and the flight was under terrorist control.

President Sadat ordered the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense to make the necessary decisions to protect the passengers and arrest the terrorists. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Defense quickly flew to Luxor International Airport where they started a secret meeting in the airport&#x27;s tower, while Major General Abdul Hafiz Al-Bagori, Governor of Qena started negotiations with the three terrorists in order to gain time. During a call between the cockpit and the airport, the pilot complained about a problem in the aircraft - that it had not shown that the aircraft needing refuelling - and that the aircraft needed maintenance. The terrorists were persuaded to allow the aircraft to land in Luxor for refuelling. Negotiations continued until 3 p.m., when the governor told the terrorists that engineers were ready. The engineers were two disguised Sa&#x27;ka officers, who went inside and outside the aircraft several times in order to appear to be maintenance workers. Minutes later three officers stormed the aircraft and captured the hijackers.

The force that stormed the aircraft was later announced to be a special unit within the Sa&#x27;ka Forces and further information was classified, the same force which was later named 777.

==EgyptAir Flight 648, 1985==
In 1985, Unit 777 was dispatched again to deal with a hijacking, this time to Malta. An Egypt Air Boeing 737 (EgyptAir Flight 648) had landed in Luqa Airport under the control of Abu Nidal faction terrorists, purportedly as retaliation for Egypt&#x27;s failure to protect the terrorists that had hijacked the MS &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; earlier that year. Although the operation was planned more carefully this time, the TF 777 operators committed several mistakes that would eventually prove fatal to many of the hostages. As explosives were detonated to attempt to blow a hole on the top of the airframe, the explosion ripped through the cabin area, immediately killing 20 passengers. Using the same hole, the operators gained entry to the plane but in the confusion opened fire indiscriminately and killed and injured more passengers. In the ensuing chaos, passengers that managed to flee the plane were then gunned down by snipers in positions around the airport who mistook them for terrorists attempting to escape. The total number of passengers killed was 57, out of 88 total.

==Op-Global Sky==

On June 3, 1998, in response to the departure of the ship &quot;Global Sky&quot; from Suez without paying port fees it owed, the Suez Canal Authority asked the Egyptian Armed Forces to intervene. The Egyptian Armed Forces decided to send Unit 777 along with naval forces to deal with the ship in international waters. Unit 777 used a Commando helicopter to descend on the main deck, capturing the whole crew without damaging the vessel.

==Current status==
After the outcomes of their first two major operations, Unit 777 was temporarily disbanded, and formed again later to deal with internal threats. The unit is currently located in southern Cairo and is equipped with Mi-8 helicopters. The unit actively trains with a number of Western special operations groups, including the United States Army&#x27;s Delta Force, United States Navy&#x27;s SEAL Team Six, and the French GIGN.

<text>The Mun River (, , ; , ), sometimes spelled &quot;Moon River&quot;, is a tributary of the Mekong River. It carries approximately of water per year.

==Geography==
The river begins in the Khao Yai National Park area of the Sankamphaeng Range, near Nakhon Ratchasima in northeast Thailand. It flows east through the Khorat Plateau in southern Isan (Nakhon Ratchasima, Buriram, Surin, and Sisaket Provinces) for , until it joins the Mekong at Khong Chiam in Ubon Ratchathani. The Mun River&#x27;s main tributary is the Chi River, which joins it in the Kanthararom District of Sisaket Province.

==History==
Thanks to the Andy Williams hit song, the Mun River was called &quot;Moon River&quot; by US Air Force personnel stationed at Ubon Ratchathani airbase during the Vietnam War. The spelling is still fairly common.

The controversial Pak Mun Dam, which is charged with causing environmental damage, is near the river&#x27;s confluence with the Mekong.

<text>William Robert Laughlin (July 5, 1932 – August 31, 1948) was an American child actor. He is best known for playing the character Froggy in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short films from 1940 to 1944, the films′ final years of production.

==Early life==
Laughlin was born on July 5, 1932, in San Gabriel, California, to Robert Vine Laughlin (August 28, 1901 – September 30, 1972) and Charlotte C. Cruikshank (March 11, 1903 – June 4, 1992). According to &quot;Our Gang&quot; actor Robert Blake, Laughlin was &quot;dearly loved&quot;.
==Career==
Laughlin rose to fame at the age of eight when he appeared in his first &quot;Our Gang&quot; film, &quot;The New Pupil&quot;, as &quot;Harold&quot; in 1940. He worked in support of Alfalfa Switzer in his first three films and then replaced the now-too-old Switzer as the comic lead of the group with the 1941 films. His character was known for his strange, guttural voice, which was reminiscent of a frog&#x27;s croak. Laughlin&#x27;s last &quot;Our Gang&quot; short film was the last film of the series in 1944 called &quot;Dancing Romeo&quot;. Laughlin did the voice himself without dubbing, basing it on a Popeye impersonation he had been doing for friends.

When &quot;Our Gang&quot; stopped production in 1944, Laughlin appeared in a cameo in Monogram&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Any More&quot;, his only non-&quot;Our Gang&quot; film, speaking in his natural voice for the only time on film.

==Death==
Laughlin died at a hospital on August 31, 1948, after colliding with a speeding truck while riding with a friend on a Cushman motor scooter. He was delivering newspapers near his home in La Puente, California. The 16-year-old friend who was operating the scooter, John Wilbrand, made a U-turn in front of the truck, but survived with minor injuries. The scooter was given to Laughlin by his parents two weeks prior to the accident. Laughlin is interred in a grave at the Rose Hills Memorial Park Cemetery in Whittier, California, next to his parents.

<text>&quot;Moon River&quot; is a song composed by Henry Mancini with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. It was originally performed by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, winning an Academy Award for Best Original Song. The song also won the 1962 Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. In 1999, Mancini&#x27;s recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The song has been recorded by many other artists. It became the theme song for Andy Williams, who first recorded it in 1962 (and performed it at the Academy Awards ceremony that year). He sang the first eight bars of the song at the beginning of each episode of his eponymous television show and named his production company and venue in Branson, Missouri, after it; his autobiography is called &quot;&quot;Moon River&quot; and Me&quot;. Williams&#x27; version was never released as a single, but it charted as an LP track that he recorded for Columbia on a hit album of 1962, &quot;Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes&quot;. In 2022, Williams&#x27; rendition of the song was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress.

The song&#x27;s success was responsible for relaunching Mercer&#x27;s career as a songwriter, which had stalled in the mid-1950s because rock and roll had replaced jazz standards as the popular music of the time. The song&#x27;s popularity is such that it has been used as a test sample in a study on people&#x27;s memories of popular songs. Comments about the lyrics have noted that they are particularly reminiscent of Mercer&#x27;s youth in the southern United States and his longing to expand his horizons. Robert Wright wrote in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;This is a love sung [&quot;sic&quot;] to wanderlust. Or a romantic song in which the romantic partner is the idea of romance.&quot; An inlet near Savannah, Georgia, Johnny Mercer&#x27;s hometown, was named Moon River in honor of him and this song.

==Versions==
===Original===
Mercer and Mancini wrote the song for Audrey Hepburn to sing in the film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;. The lyrics, written by Mercer, are reminiscent of his childhood in Savannah, Georgia, including its waterways. As a child, he had picked huckleberries in summer, and he connected them with a carefree childhood and Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Mercer&#x27;s original title for the song was &quot;Blue River&quot;, reflecting the color of huckleberries. Although an instrumental version is played over the film&#x27;s opening titles, the lyrics are first heard in a scene where Paul &quot;Fred&quot; Varjak (George Peppard) discovers Holly Golightly (Hepburn) singing the song, accompanying herself on the guitar while sitting on the fire escape outside their apartments.

There was an eruption of behind-the-scenes consternation when a Paramount Pictures executive, Martin Rackin, suggested removing the song from the film after a tepid Los Angeles preview. Hepburn&#x27;s reaction was described by Mancini and others in degrees varying from her saying, &quot;Over my dead body!&quot; to her using more colorful language to make the same point.

An album version was recorded by Mancini and his orchestra and chorus (without Hepburn&#x27;s vocal) on December 8, 1960. It was released as a single in 1961 and became a number 11 hit in December of that year. Due to unpublished charts in &quot;Billboard&quot;, Joel Whitburn&#x27;s &quot;Top Adult (Contemporary) Songs&quot; variously reported the song as a number 3 or number 1 easy listening hit. Mancini&#x27;s original version was also featured in the film &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989). In 1993, following Hepburn&#x27;s death, her version was released on an album titled &quot;Music from the Films of Audrey Hepburn&quot;. In 2004, Hepburn&#x27;s version finished at number 4 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema.

===Early recordings===
&quot;Moon River&quot; was a hit single for Jerry Butler in late 1961. Released simultaneously with Mancini&#x27;s, it reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number 3 Easy Listening in December, two weeks before Mancini&#x27;s recording reached the same chart ranking. In Canada the song reached number 14, co-charting with the Mancini version. British singer Danny Williams had a hit version of the song that reached number one in the UK in the final week of 1961.

Although Andy Williams never released the song as a single, his LP &quot;Moon River and Other Great Movie Themes&quot; (1962), was certified gold in 1963 for selling one million units. The album reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200, eventually selling more than two million copies by 1967. In 2002, a 74-year-old Andy Williams sang the song at the conclusion of the live NBC special telecast celebrating the network&#x27;s 75th anniversary. In 2018, Andy Williams&#x27; version on Columbia Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2022, Andy Williams&#x27; recording of the song was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

==Later versions==
Hundreds of versions of the song have been recorded and it has been featured in many media. Mercer recorded the song in 1974 for his album &quot;My Huckleberry Friend&quot;. In 2007, saxophonist Dave Koz recorded a version from his standards music album, &quot;At the Movies&quot;, sung by Barry Manilow. In 2013, Neil Finn and Paul Kelly performed the song on their Goin&#x27; Your Way Tour, during which their performance at the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall was recorded for the live album, &quot;Goin&#x27; Your Way&quot;, released the same year. The title of the album comes from a phrase in the song&#x27;s chorus: &quot;Wherever you&#x27;re goin&#x27;, I&#x27;m goin&#x27; your way&quot;. Lawrence Welk&#x27;s 1961 instrumental version was featured in &quot;Mad Men&quot; season 6, episode 13, &quot;In Care Of&quot; (2013). A version of the song was featured in Asif Kapadia&#x27;s documentary film, &quot;Amy&quot; (2015), about Amy Winehouse. Winehouse&#x27;s version, sung at age 16 with the National Youth Jazz Orchestra in 2000, is the opening song in the film.

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; listed, among prominent covers of the song, those by Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Sarah Vaughan, Louis Armstrong, Sarah Brightman and Chevy Chase (in the comedy film &quot;Fletch&quot;). Other stars who have covered the song include Rod Stewart in &quot;Fly Me to the Moon... The Great American Songbook Volume V&quot; (2010), which charted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Barbra Streisand in &quot;The Movie Album&quot; (2003), a Grammy-nominated gold album, and Frank Ocean, who released a cover on Valentine&#x27;s Day 2018 that debuted in the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B chart. Diffuser.fm named these the &quot;Top 5 Alt-Rock&quot; versions of the song: Morrissey, Glasvegas, R.E.M., The Killers and Josh Ritter. Jacob Collier&#x27;s &quot;a capella&quot; cover won the 2020 Grammy Award for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella.
