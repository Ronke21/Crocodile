<text>Theodore William &quot;Ted&quot; Waitt (born January 18, 1963) is an American billionaire businessman and philanthropist. Waitt is a co-founder of Gateway, Inc.

==Career==
On September 5, 1985, Waitt, his brother Norm Jr., and Mike Hammond started &quot;Gateway 2000&quot; with a $10,000 loan secured by Waitt&#x27;s grandmother. The company began on Waitt&#x27;s father&#x27;s cattle ranch in Sioux City, Iowa, moved to Sergeant Bluff, Iowa and later to North Sioux City, South Dakota, where they continued to develop their &quot;down-home&quot; branding, complete with computer boxes printed in a black and white Holstein cow pattern.

Waitt led a move of the company&#x27;s headquarters from South Dakota to Poway, California in 1998. Waitt relinquished his post as CEO of Gateway in late 1999 to Jeffrey Weitzen, but returned to the post in January 2001.

In 2004, after the acquisition of eMachines, Waitt turned over day-to-day operations of Gateway and the title of CEO to Wayne Inouye, the former CEO of eMachines. In May 2005, he resigned as chairman of the company, ending a near 20-year run with the company he co-founded.

Waitt has been featured on numerous lists by Forbes magazine. He has held a spot on both the Forbes 400 Richest in America as well as Forbes list of the World&#x27;s Billionaires. He has also been listed on Fortune Magazines &quot;40 Richest Under 40&quot;, a list of the 40 wealthiest self-made Americans under the age of 40 in the United States. The 2008 Forbes 400 List listed Waitt with a net worth estimated at $1.4 billion. Waitt fell off the Forbes 400 list in 2009 with a net worth estimate of $900 million. Forbes speculated that the drop from the previous year was as a result of &quot;souring real estate&quot; and a divorce settlement.

According to the September 2002 issue of Fortune Magazine, Waitt sold $1.1 billion in Gateway stock during the dot-com era. In August 2007, Gateway was acquired by Acer Inc. for $1.90 per share or $710 million.

Labeled a maverick by national business and technology publications, he has gone on to form four enterprises that are his chief interests: Avalon Capital Group, Inc., a wholly owned, billion-dollar private investment company with diverse interests in technology, health care, energy, finance, and real estate; and the Waitt Foundation, Waitt Institute and Waitt Institute for Violence Prevention, nonprofit organizations dedicated to the improvement of mankind&#x27;s knowledge through historical and scientific exploration.

Waitt served as chairman of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies Board of Trustees from November 28, 2016, until November 20, 2017. He originally joined the Salk Board of Trustees in 2004 and has served in numerous roles while donating millions of dollars to the institute.

==Personal life==
Waitt is married to former model Michele Merkin. He and his first wife Joan Theresa Peschel had four children, Hailey Peschel, Emily Rose, Maxwell Griffin, and Sophia Marie. Waitt&#x27;s eldest daughter, Hailey, is married to former soccer player Jordan Gafa.

Waitt was romantically linked to Ghislaine Maxwell, after she ended her relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. Waitt owns homes in the Bird Streets area of Hollywood Hills West, Los Angeles (put up for sale for $20 million in September 2015) and in La Jolla, California (purchased in 2005 for $13.32 million and put for sale for $22.9 million in November 2015). Waitt also owns a home in Beverly Hills, California. In 2020 he bought the Malibu, California residence of designer James Perse.

==Awards and honors==
Waitt was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of South Dakota.

== Philanthropy ==
&quot;Business Week&quot; named Waitt one of America&#x27;s 50 most generous philanthropists due to his work with the Waitt Foundation. The Foundation funds partnerships and projects, sometimes in conjunction or collaboration with the Waitt Institutes, focused on marine conservation.

Established in 1993, the Foundation initially focused on domestic violence prevention and community development. The Waitt Institute is a founding member, along with National Geographic Pristine Seas, Oceans 5, and Dynamic Planet, of the Blue Prosperity Coalition which aims to support governments in sustainable oceans management by providing financing, expertise, and tools to create marine protected areas (MPA).

On November 1, 2019, the Blue Prosperity Coalition announced a ten-year, $150 million commitment from the Waitt Foundation towards its ocean conservation efforts. On 15 Sept, 2016, the Waitt Foundation joined with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WSC), the blue moon fund (bmf), and the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) to commit a combined $48 million towards expansion of the world&#x27;s marine protected areas (MPA). On 1 May 2008, the Salk Institute for Biological Studies announced the grant of $20 million from the Waitt Foundation to fund the creation of an Advanced Biophotonics Center. On 18 December 2008, the William J. Clinton Foundation released a list of all contributors. It included Theodore Waitt, who gave between US$10–25 million. On April 23, 2011, the Sioux City Public Museum had its grand opening. $4 million of its $13 million development budget was donated by the Waitt Foundation.

<text>Deonar is a suburb of Mumbai. The east is in Chembur whereas the west in Govandi. It has gained prominence for being the location of the largest dumping ground in Asia and also the location of city&#x27;s largest abattoir, Deonar Municipal Abattoir.

==Important Landmarks==
India&#x27;s largest abattoir is located in Deonar. It also has institutes like the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) and International Institute for Population Sciences here. The other landmark here is the BSNL Telecom Factory. It also houses the premium residential complex Raheja Acropolis. 

Deonar is also home to some beautiful green bungalow societies like Acharya Nagar, Saras Baug, Uday Giri, Vikram Jyoti, Datta Guru, Deonar Baug, Madhuban, Green Acres, Patwardhan Colony etc. While most of the bungalows of Chembur, Bandra and Juhu have been replaced with buildings, Deonars&#x27; societies continue to have bungalows … making it possibly the suburb with the maximum number of bungalows in Mumbai. Additionally there are several colonial bungalows on Deonar Farm Road like Raj Kapoor&#x27;s Devnar Cottage. 

Runwal Centre, Orchid Residency and Neelkanth Gardens are massive residential societies in this area. There is also Shivaji Chowk, a big vehicle roundabout with a statue of Shivaji Maharaj. Near to Shivaji Chowk, was R.K. Studio which recently caught fire. 

Raikar Chambers is a well known commercial centre located near Govandi Jain Temple.

==Govandi Jain Temple==

The Govandi Jain Temple has become a popular pilgrimage spot for devotees across the country. It was built primarily due to the contribution of two devotees – Mr Roopchand Rathod and Mr Chinubhai Chamanlal Shah. The land was donated by Mr Rathod. Mr Chinubhai single-handedly contributed Rs 5 million for constructing the entire temple complex. The highlight of this temple is the 2300 year old idol of Neminath Bhagwan, the 22nd Tirthankara of Jains, which was sourced from Gujarat during the consecration of the temple. This idol was excavated from a cave. It belongs to the Sampratikaal Raja&#x27;s era. Emperor Samprati was the grandson of Emperor Ashoka the Great. Every other Jain temple in the city has contemporary idols crafted by artisans.

==Demographics==
Deonar is mostly residential and has several government staff colonies like Teachers Colony (for Municipal school teachers).

==Transport==
The main public modes of transport are autorickshaws, taxi and BEST bus. Deonar has a BEST bus depot. The closest railway station is Govandi Railway Station to Deonar and it is situated near areas like Chembur, connected via P L Lokhande Marg and Vashi.

==Environmental Issues==
The location of the abattoir, landfills along with the close proximity to industries like BPCL and HPCL has led to raising of several environment concerns in Deonar.

<doc id="547482" wikidata="Q32940" url="?curid=547482" title="Andamanese languages">
<text>The Andamanese languages are the various languages spoken by the indigenous peoples of the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. There are two known Andamanese language families, Great Andamanese and Ongan, as well as two presumed but unattested languages, Sentinelese and Jangil. 

Although the languages in the Andaman Islands were once assumed to be in the same language family, it is now widely accepted that Great Andamanese and Ongan have no genealogical relationship. Thus, the term &quot;Andamanese languages&quot; is now a geographic label.

== Classification ==

The attested Andamanese languages fall into two genetically unrelated families:

*Great Andamanese: A moribund language family once spoken by Great Andamanese people. Today, the first language of most Great Andamanese people is Hindi. 
*Ongan: Two languages, Jarawa and Onge, spoken by roughly 670 people in 2020.

In addition, there are two unattested languages: 
* Sentinelese: Because the Sentinelese people refuse contact with outsiders, their language and exact population are unknown. There are likely at least 50 speakers, and perhaps upwards of 250. Anvita Abbi (2020) believes that Sentinelese is most likely Ongan. 
*Jangil: Extinct by 1920s. No ethnically Jangil people survive today. Maurice Vidal Portman observed that Jangil shared similarities with Jarawa, and believed that they were at one point the same language. 

The languages of the Andaman Islands have frequently been assumed to be from the same single Andamanese language family. However, the similarities between Great Andamanese and Ongan are so far mainly of a typological morphological nature, with little common vocabulary. Abbi (2009) demonstrated that the Andaman Islands have two unrelated language families: Great Andamanese and Ongan. 

Blevins (2007) summarizes,

=== Controversial classifications ===
Joseph Greenberg proposed that the Great Andamanese languages are related to western Papuan languages as members of a phylum he called Indo-Pacific, but this is not generally accepted by other linguists. Stephen Wurm states that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese and the West Papuan and certain languages of Timor &quot;are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity […] in a number of instances&quot;, but considers this to be due to a linguistic substratum rather than a direct relationship. 

Blevins (2007) proposes that the Ongan languages are related to Austronesian in an Austronesian–Ongan family, for which she has attempted to establish regular sound correspondences. The proposed connection between Austronesian and Ongan has not been supported by Austronesianists, and Robert Blust (2014) finds that Blevins&#x27; conclusions are not supported by her data: Of her first 25 reconstructions, none are reproducible using the comparative method, and Blust concludes that the grammatical comparison does not hold up. Blust, in addition, cites non-linguistic (such as cultural, archaeological, and biological) evidence against Blevins&#x27; hypothesis.

== History ==

The indigenous peoples of the Andaman Islands have lived there for thousands of years. Although the existence of the islands and their inhabitants was long known to maritime powers and traders of the South– and Southeast–Asia region, contact with these peoples was highly sporadic and very often hostile. As a result, almost nothing is recorded of them or their languages until the mid-18th century. 

By the late 18th century, when the British first established a colonial presence on the Andaman Islands, there were an estimated 5,000 Great Andamanese living on Great Andaman and surrounding islands, comprising 10 distinct tribes with distinct but closely related languages. 

From the 1860s onwards, the British established a penal colony on the islands, which led to the subsequent arrival of mainland settlers and indentured labourers, mainly from the Indian subcontinent. This coincided with the massive population reduction of the Andamanese due to outside diseases. 

One of the first accounts in English of the languages was by the early phonetician Alexander John Ellis, who presented to the Philological Society on the South Andamanese languages on his retirement. This presentation was later adapted into a &quot;Report of Researches into the Language of the South Andaman Island&quot;.

By the beginning of the 20th century most of these populations were greatly reduced in numbers, and the various linguistic and tribal divisions among the Great Andamanese effectively ceased to exist, despite a census of the time still classifying the groups as separate. Their linguistic diversity also suffered as the surviving populations intermingled with one another, and some also intermarried with Karen (Burmese) and Indian settlers.

By the latter part of the 20th century, the majority of Great Andamanese languages had become extinct.

At the start of the 21st century only about 50 or so individuals of Great Andamanese descent remained, resettled to a single small island (Strait I.). About half of these individuals speak what may be considered a modified version (or creole) of Great Andamanese, based mainly on Aka-Jeru. This modified version has been called &quot;Present Great Andamanese&quot; by some scholars, but also may be referred to simply as &quot;Jero&quot; or &quot;Great Andamanese&quot;. Hindi increasingly serves as their primary language, and is the only language for around half of them.

The Ongan languages survive mainly because of the greater isolation of the peoples who speak them. This isolation has been reinforced by an outright hostility towards outsiders and extreme reluctance to engage in contact with them by South Andamanese tribes, particularly the Sentinelese and Jarawa. The Sentinelese have been so resistant that their language remains entirely unknown to outsiders.

==Lexicon==
Abbi (2009) lists the following lexical items for Onge, Jarawa, and Great Andamanese, showing that Ongan and Great Andamanese are distinct language families sharing few lexical similarities.

<text>An action-adventure game is a video game hybrid genre that combines core elements from both the action game and adventure game genres.

Typically, classical adventure games have situational problems for the player to explore and solve to complete a storyline, involving little to no action. If there is action, it is generally confined to isolated instances. Classical action games, on the other hand, have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenges the player&#x27;s reflexes and eye-hand coordination. Action-adventure games combine these genres by engaging both eye-hand coordination and problem-solving skills.

== Definition ==
An action adventure game can be defined as a game with a mix of elements from an action game and an adventure game, especially crucial elements like puzzles inspired by older adventure games. Action-adventures require many of the same physical skills as action games, but may also offer a storyline, numerous characters, an inventory system, dialogue, and other features of adventure games. They are typically faster-paced than pure adventure games, because they include both physical and conceptual challenges. Action-adventure games normally include a combination of complex story elements, which are often displayed for players using audio and video. The story is heavily reliant upon the player character&#x27;s movement, which triggers story events and thus affects the flow of the game. Popular examples of action-adventure games include &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;God of War&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot;, and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series.

=== Relationship to other genres ===
There is a good deal of controversy over what actually constitutes an action-adventure game. One definition of the term &quot;action-adventure&quot; may be &#x27;&quot;An action/adventure game is a game that has enough action in it not to be called an adventure game, but not enough action to be called an action game.&quot; In some cases an action game with puzzles will be classified as an action-adventure game, but if these puzzles are quite simple they might be classified as an action game. Others see action games as a pure genre, while an action-adventure is an action game that includes situational problem-solving. Adventure gamers may also be purists, rejecting any game that makes use of physical challenges or time pressure. Regardless, the action-adventure label is prominent in articles over the internet and media. The term &quot;action-adventure&quot; is usually substituted for a particular subgenre due to its wide scope.

== Subgenres ==

Although action-adventure games are diverse and difficult to classify, there are some distinct subgenres. Many games with gameplay similar to those in &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series are called Zelda clones or &quot;Zelda&quot;-like games. Popular subgenres include:

=== &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; clone ===
A &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; clone belongs to a subgenre of open world action-adventure video games in the third-person perspective. They are characterized by their likeness to the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series in either gameplay or overall design. In these types of open world games, players may find and use a variety of vehicles and weapons while roaming freely in an open world setting.

=== Metroidvania ===
Metroidvania is a portmanteau of &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Castlevania&quot;; such games are sometimes referred to as &quot;search action&quot;, and are generally based on two-dimensional platformers. They emphasize both exploration and puzzle-solving with traditional platform gameplay.

=== Survival horror ===
Survival horror games emphasize &quot;inventory management&quot; and making sure the player has enough ammunition and recovery items to &quot;survive&quot; the horror setting. This is a thematic genre with diverse gameplay, so not all survival horror games share all the features. The &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise popularized this subgenre.

== Gameplay ==

Action-adventure games are faster-paced than pure adventure games, and include physical as well as conceptual challenges where the story is enacted rather than narrated. While motion-based, often reflexive, actions are required, the gameplay still follows a number of adventure game genre tropes (gathering items, exploration of and interaction with one&#x27;s environment, often including an overworld connecting areas of importance, and puzzle-solving). While the controls are arcade-style (character movement, few action commands) there is an ultimate goal beyond a high score. In most action-adventure games, the player controls a single avatar as the protagonist. This type of game is often quite similar to role-playing video games.

They are distinct from graphic adventures, which sometimes have free-moving central characters, but also a wider variety of commands and fewer or no action game elements and are distinct too from text adventures, characterized by many different commands introduced by the user via a complex text parser and no free-moving character. While they share general gameplay dynamics, action-adventures vary widely in the design of their viewpoints, including bird&#x27;s eye, side-scrolling, first-person, third-person, over-the-shoulder, or even a 3/4 isometric view.

Many action-adventure games simulate a conversation through a conversation tree. When the player encounters a non-player character, they are allowed to select a choice of what to say. The NPC gives a scripted response to the player, and the game offers the player several new ways to respond.

Due to the action-adventure subgenre&#x27;s broad and inclusive nature, it causes some players to have difficulty finishing a particular game. Companies have devised ways to give the player help, such as offering clues or allowing the player to skip puzzles to compensate for this lack of ability.

== History ==
=== 1979–1988 ===
Brett Weiss cites Atari&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; (1979) as an action-adventure game, with &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; crediting it as the &quot;first to utilize multiple screens as playing area&quot;. Mark J.P. Wolf credits &quot;Adventure&quot; (1980) for the Atari VCS as the earliest-known action-adventure game. The game involves exploring a 2D environment, finding and using items which each have prescribed abilities, and fighting dragons in real-time like in an action game. Muse Software&#x27;s &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; (1981) was another early action-adventure game, merging exploration, combat, stealth, and maze game elements, drawing inspiration from arcade shoot &#x27;em ups and maze games (such as maze-shooter &quot;Berzerk&quot;) and war films (such as &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;).

According to &quot;Wizardry&quot; developer Roe R. Adams, early action-adventure games &quot;were basically arcade games done in a fantasy&quot; setting. &quot;Tutankham&quot;, debuted by Konami in January 1982, was an action-adventure released for arcades. It combined maze, shoot &#x27;em up, puzzle-solving and adventure elements, with a 1983 review by &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine calling it &quot;the first game that effectively combined the elements of an adventure game with frenetic shoot &#x27;em up gameplay.&quot; It inspired the similar &quot;Time Bandit&quot; (1983). &quot;Action Quest&quot;, released in May 1982, blended puzzle elements of adventure games into a joystick-controlled, arcade-style action game, which surprised reviewers at the time.

While noting some similarities to &quot;Adventure&quot;, IGN argues that &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; (1986) by Nintendo &quot;helped to establish a new subgenre of action-adventure&quot;, becoming a success due to how it combined elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid, including exploration, adventure-style inventory puzzles, an action component, a monetary system, and simplified RPG-style level building without the experience points. &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series was the most prolific action-adventure game franchise through to the 2000s. Roe R. Adams also cited the arcade-style side-scrolling fantasy games &quot;Castlevania&quot; (1986), &quot;Trojan&quot; (1986) and &quot;Wizards &amp; Warriors&quot; (1987) as early examples of action-adventure games.

Games like &quot;Brain Breaker&quot; (1985), &quot;Xanadu&quot; (1985), &quot;Metroid&quot; (1986) and &quot;Vampire Killer&quot; (1986) combined a side-scrolling platformer format with adventure exploration, creating the Metroidvania platform-adventure subgenre. Similarly, games like &quot;005&quot; (1981), &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear&quot; (1987) combined action-adventure exploration with stealth mechanics, laying the foundations for the stealth game subgenre, which would later be popularized in 1998 with the releases of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

=== 1989–present ===
The cinematic platformer &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; (1989) featured action-adventure elements, inspiring games such as &quot;Another World&quot; (1991) and &quot;Flashback&quot; (1992). &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; (1992) used 3D graphics, which would later be popularized by &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (1996) and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (1996). &quot;Resident Evil&quot; in particular created the survival horror subgenre, inspiring titles such as &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (1999) and &quot;Fatal Frame&quot; (2001).

Action-adventure games have gone on to become more popular than the pure adventure games and pure platform games that inspired them. Recent examples include the &quot;Uncharted&quot; franchise, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="547494" wikidata="Q161688" url="?curid=547494" title="1-Wire">
<text>1-Wire is a wired half-duplex serial bus designed by Dallas Semiconductor that provides low-speed (16.3 kbit/s) data communication and supply voltage over a single conductor.

1-Wire is similar in concept to I2C, but with lower data rates and longer range. It is typically used to communicate with small inexpensive devices such as digital thermometers and weather instruments. A network of 1-Wire devices with an associated master device is called a MicroLAN. The protocol is also used in small electronic keys known as a Dallas key or .

One distinctive feature of the bus is the possibility of using only two conductors — data and ground. To accomplish this, 1-Wire devices integrate a small capacitor (~800pF) to store charge, which powers the device during periods when the data line is active.

== Usage example ==
1-Wire devices are available in different packages: integrated circuits, a TO-92-style package (as typically used for transistors), and a portable form called an or Dallas key which is a small stainless-steel package that resembles a watch battery. Manufacturers also produce devices more complex than a single component that use the 1-Wire bus to communicate.

1-Wire devices can fit in different places in a system. It might be one of many components on a circuit board within a product. It also might be a single component within a device such as a temperature probe. It could be attached to a device being monitored. Some laboratory systems connect to 1-Wire devices using cables with modular connectors or CAT-5 cable. In such systems, RJ11 (6P2C or 6P4C modular plugs, commonly used for telephones) are popular.

Systems of sensors and actuators can be built by wiring together many 1-Wire components. Each 1-Wire component contains all of the logic needed to operate on the 1-Wire bus. Examples include temperature loggers, timers, voltage and current sensors, battery monitors, and memory. These can be connected to a PC using a bus converter. USB, RS-232 serial, and parallel port interfaces are popular solutions for connecting a MicroLan to the host PC. 1-Wire devices can also be interfaced directly to microcontrollers from various vendors.

 are connected to 1-Wire bus systems by means of sockets with contacts that touch the &quot;lid&quot; and &quot;base&quot; of the canister. Alternatively, the connection can be semi-permanent with a socket into which the clips, but from which it is easily removed.

Each 1-Wire chip has a unique identifier code. This feature makes the chips, especially , suitable electronic keys. Some uses include locks, burglar alarms, computer systems, manufacturer-approved accessories, time clocks and courier and maintenance keys for smart safes. have been used as Akbil smart tickets for the public transport in Istanbul.

=== Power supplies ===
Apple MagSafe- and MagSafe-2-connector–equipped power supplies, displays, and Mac laptops use the 1-Wire protocol to send and receive data to and from the connected Mac laptop, via the middle pin of the connector. Data include power supply model, wattage, and serial number; and laptop commands to send full power, and illuminate the red or green light-emitting diodes in the connector.

Genuine Dell laptop power supplies use the 1-Wire protocol to send data via the third wire to the laptop computer about power, current and voltage ratings. The laptop will then refuse charging if the adapter does not meet requirements.

== Communication protocol ==
In any MicroLan, there is always one master in overall charge, which may be a personal computer or a microcontroller. The master initiates activity on the bus, simplifying the avoidance of collisions on the bus. Protocols are built into the master&#x27;s software to detect collisions. After a collision, the master retries the required communication.

A 1-Wire network is a single open drain wire with a single pull-up resistor. The pull-up resistor pulls the wire up to 3 or 5 volts. The master device and all the slaves each have a single open-drain connection to drive the wire, and a way to sense the state of the wire. Despite the &quot;1-Wire&quot; name, all devices must also have a second conductor for a ground connection to permit a return current to flow through the data wire. Communication occurs when a master or slave briefly pulls the bus low, &quot;i.e.&quot;, connects the pull-up resistor to ground through its output MOSFET. The data wire is high when idle, and so it can also power a limited number of slave devices. Data rates of 16.3 kbit/s can be achieved. There is also an overdrive mode that speeds up the communication by a factor of 10.

A short 1-Wire bus can be driven from a single digital I/O pin on a microcontroller. A universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) can also be used. Specific 1-Wire driver and bridge chips are available. Universal Serial Bus &quot;bridge&quot; chips are also available. Bridge chips are particularly useful to drive cables longer than 100 m. Up to 300-meter twisted pairs, &quot;i.e.&quot;, telephone cables, have been tested by the manufacturer. These extreme lengths require adjustments to the pull-up resistances from .

The master starts a transmission with a &quot;reset&quot; pulse, which pulls the wire to 0 volts for at least 480 μs. This resets every slave device on the bus. After that, any slave device, if present, shows that it exists with a &quot;presence&quot; pulse: it holds the bus low for at least 60 μs after the master releases the bus.

To send a binary number &quot;1&quot;, the bus master sends a very brief () low pulse. To send a binary number &quot;0&quot;, the master sends a 60 μs low pulse. The falling (negative) edge of the pulse is used to start a monostable multivibrator in the slave device. The multivibrator in the slave reads the data line about 30 μs after the falling edge. The slave&#x27;s internal timer is an inexpensive analog timer. It has analog tolerances that affect its timing accuracy. Therefore, the pulses are calculated to be within margins. Therefore, the &quot;0&quot; pulses have to be 60 μs long, and the &quot;1&quot; pulses can&#x27;t be longer than 15 μs.

When receiving data, the master sends a pulse to start each bit. If the transmitting slave unit wants to send a &quot;1&quot;, it does nothing, and the bus goes to the pulled-up voltage. If the transmitting slave wants to send a &quot;0&quot;, it pulls the data line to ground for .

The basic sequence is a reset pulse followed by an eight-bit command, and then data are sent or received in groups of eight bits.

When a sequence of data is being transferred, errors can be detected with an eight-bit CRC (weak data protection).

Many devices can share the same bus. Each device on the bus has a 64-bit serial number, of which eight bits are used as a checksum, thus allowing a &quot;universe&quot; of 256 (over 7.2 × 1016) unique device identities. The least significant byte of the serial number is an eight-bit number that tells the type of the device. The most significant byte is a standard (for the 1-Wire bus) eight-bit CRC.

There are several standard broadcast commands, as well as commands used to address a particular device. The master can send a selection command, then the address of a particular device. The next command is executed only by the addressed device.

The 1-Wire bus enumeration protocol, like other singulation protocols, is an algorithm the master uses to read the address of every device on the bus. Since the address includes the device type and a CRC, recovering the roster of addresses also produces a reliable inventory of the devices on the bus. To find the devices, the master broadcasts an enumeration command, and then an address, &quot;listening&quot; after each bit of an address. If a slave&#x27;s address matches all the address bits sent so far, it returns a 0. The master uses this simple behavior to search systematically for valid sequences of address bits. The process is much faster than a brute force search of all possible 56-bit numbers, because as soon as an invalid bit is detected, all subsequent address bits are known to be invalid. The 56-bit address space is searched as a binary tree, allowing up to 75 devices to be found per second. The order in which device addresses are discovered by this enumeration protocol is deterministic and depends only on the device type and serial number. Bit-reversing these 56 bits yields the order of discovery for devices using Maxim&#x27;s published algorithm (algorithm defined in Application Note 187). The search algorithm can be implemented in an alternative form, initially searching paths with address bits equal to 1, rather than 0. In this case, inverting the 56 address bits and then reversing them yields the order of discovery.

The location of devices on the bus is sometimes significant. For these situations, a microcontroller can use several pins, or the manufacturer has a 1-Wire device that can switch the bus off or pass it on. Software can therefore explore sequential &quot;bus domains&quot;.

== Example communication with a device ==
The following signals were generated by an FPGA, which was the master for the communication with a DS2432 (EEPROM) chip, and measured with a logic analyzer. A logic high on the 1-Wire output, means the output of the FPGA is in tri-state mode and the 1-Wire device can pull the bus low. A low means the FPGA pulls down the bus. The 1-Wire input is the measured bus signal. On input sample time high, the FPGA samples the input for detecting the device response and receiving bits.

== Development tools ==
When developing and/or troubleshooting the 1-Wire bus, examination of hardware signals can be very important. Logic analyzers and bus analyzers are tools that collect, analyze, decode, and store signals to simplify viewing the high-speed waveforms.

<text>The Gateshead Millennium Bridge is a pedestrian and cyclist tilt bridge spanning the River Tyne between Gateshead arts quarter on the south bank and Newcastle upon Tyne&#x27;s Quayside area on the north bank. It was the first tilting bridge ever to be constructed. Opened for public use in 2001, the award-winning structure was conceived and designed by architectural practice WilkinsonEyre and structural engineering firm Gifford. The bridge is sometimes called the &#x27;Blinking Eye Bridge&#x27; or the &#x27;Winking Eye Bridge&#x27; due to its shape and its tilting method. The Millennium Bridge stands as the twentieth tallest structure in the city, and is shorter in stature than the neighbouring Tyne Bridge.

== History ==
=== Historical context ===
Gateshead Millennium Bridge is part of a long history of bridges built across the River Tyne, the earliest of which was constructed in the Middle Ages. As quay-based industries grew during the Industrial Revolution and Victorian era due to its accessible port, the area became more prosperous. However, industry declined along the River Tyne following World War II and the quay deteriorated into the 1980s. This prompted regeneration activities in both Newcastle and Gateshead, beginning with the construction of Newcastle Law Courts on the riverbank. In 1995, Gateshead Council devised plans to develop a new contemporary arts centre, the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, and the need for a footbridge to link the two cities became more apparent.
=== Conception ===
A competition was held by Gateshead Council in 1996 to design a new bridge to link Gateshead to Newcastle, the first opening bridge to be built on the River Tyne in over 100 years. The bridge would form part of the regeneration on both sides of the River Tyne, providing a crossing between new commercial buildings and housing built in Newcastle and cultural and leisure developments in Gateshead. It would also facilitate a circular promenade around the Quayside. Although river-based traffic had decreased by the 21st century, the cities of Gateshead and Newcastle still intended to retain the image of the River Tyne as a working river. The advert for the competition was published in the &quot;New Civil Engineer&quot; magazine with the brief &quot;We are looking for design teams who can create a stunning, but practical, river level crossing which fits this historic setting, opens for shipping and is good enough to win Millennium Commission funding.&quot; There were over 150 entries and Gateshead residents voted for their favourite out of a shortlist of six architectural teams. WilkinsonEyre and Gifford and Partners claimed the prize in February 1997 with Gateshead Councillor Mick Henry remarking that the design was &quot;something very special.&quot;

By July 1997, a final design was under preparation for submission to the Millennium Commission in order to secure funding. The bridge, which is the world&#x27;s first tilting bridge, ultimately cost £22million, with funding from the Millennium Commission, the European Regional Development Fund, English Partnerships, East Gateshead Single Regeneration Budget, and Gateshead Council. By this point, the name of the bridge was still undecided. The original proposed name of &#x27;Baltic Millennium Bridge&#x27; (in reference to the adjacent Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art on the Gateshead side) was objected to by Newcastle City Council. In response, Gateshead Council decided upon the final name of &#x27;Gateshead Millennium Bridge&#x27; in 1998, which caused an ongoing feud between the two councils.

=== Opening ===
Gateshead Council originally announced that the bridge would be open in September 2000, but it was not completed until September the following year. The first tilt took place on 28 June 2001 to 36,000 onlookers. It was opened to the public on 17 September 2001 to a crowd of thousands. The barrier lifted at 2pm to allow the first public crossing, and the first people to cross received a commemorative medal gift from the Council. The bridge was dedicated by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 May 2002, during her Golden Jubilee tour. A commemorative plaque unveiled by the Queen reads: &quot;Gateshead Millennium Bridge. Opened by Her Majesty The Queen on 7th May 2002.&quot; Before a formal dinner at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, the Queen said &quot;Today I see the tangible signs of the determination of all those within this region to create a new future. There have been so many personal acts of kindness, especially over the last two months, now I have the chance to express my gratitude to the people of the North East.&quot;

==Structure==

=== Design ===

Gateshead Millennium Bridge was constructed to fulfil the following main design constraints: the bridge must be above river-level during high spring tides when closed; nothing must be built on the Gateshead Quayside; the deck must have no more than a 1:20 slope to allow disabled access. The bridge consists of two steel arches – a deck which acts as the pedestrian and cycle path, and a supporting arch. The bridge was designed to be as light as possible to allow for easy opening and closing, so the two arches are lighter towards the centre span than at the hinges. The pedestrian and cycle deck is a parabolic shape with a vertical camber. It is divided into two separate paths on different levels for the different modes of transport, separated by a stainless steel &quot;hedge&quot; with seating areas and steps interspersed throughout. The supporting arch is also a parabola, designed in such a way as to match the shape of the Tyne Bridge upstream. The two arches are joined together by 18 suspension cables which provide stability for people crossing the bridge.

Six hydraulic rams (three on each side) tilt the entire 850,000kg bridge as a single structure, meaning that when the supporting arch lowers, the pedestrian deck rises to create of clearance for river traffic to pass underneath. The bridge takes around four minutes to rotate through the full 40° from closed to open, moving as fast as per second. The design is so energy-efficient that, , it cost just £3.96 per opening. The appearance of the bridge during this manoeuvre has led to it being nicknamed the &quot;Blinking Eye Bridge&quot;, and has solidified its reputation as being not only a functional piece of infrastructure but a spectacle in and of itself. The rotation of the bridge is also used as a self-cleaning mechanism, as rubbish collected on the deck rolls towards traps built at each end.

A lighting system designed by Jonathan Spiers and Associates is used at night to attractively illuminate the bridge without causing light pollution, as the cables are too thin to be visible or reflect light at night. The lights shine white during the week and a variety of colours over the weekend. Green and red LEDs are used during the day to alert cyclists and pedestrians to the bridge&#x27;s opening and closing.
=== Construction and installation ===
Gateshead Council selected Gateshead-based Harbour &amp; General as the main contractor for the construction of the bridge. Harbour and General then selected over 12 sub-contractors to cover elements of construction including control systems, metalwork, lighting, and piling and river work. Consulting engineering group Ramboll provided further engineering, construction, and contract management services. The bridge&#x27;s structure was modelled in LUSAS using 3D elements. LUSAS modelling allowed a model of the bridge to be built and allowed analysis of buckling forces, wind, and temperature. Another software – Pertmaster Professional – was used for risk and project management and cost analysis.

Watson Steel was appointed as the specialist contractor to prefabricate the bridge, and they subcontracted the design of the hydraulic system to Kvaerner Markham. The pre-fabricated sections of the bridge were shot-blasted and painted in Hadrian&#x27;s Yard, from the bridge&#x27;s final position. The entire structure was assembled by first welding together the nine arch sections and deck sections, and then attaching the cables to the arch and deck. Protective paintwork (Interzone 505 and Interthane 990 from International Protective Coatings) was applied to the arch before it was erected.

The bridge was lifted into place in one piece by the Asian Hercules II, one of the world&#x27;s largest floating cranes, on 20 November 2000. Whilst being transported by the crane, the bridge was rotated 90° in order to navigate narrow bends along the river. It was successfully slotted into threaded bolts in the piers with only of tolerance. Handrails, seating, and the hydraulic systems were installed after the bridge was in place. The transportation of the bridge took only one day and was a spectacle, attracting crowds of onlookers.

The Port of Tyne Authority required the design of the bridge to incorporate a vessel collision protection system. As a result, two rows of parallel fixed piles, splaying out diagonally on each side of the bridge, were installed. However, it became clear to members of the construction project team and WilkinsonEyre that they were unsightly and undermined &quot;the finesse of the bridge&quot;. Between February and June 2000, the unsightly nature of the piles also caught the attention of the public, with multiple news articles and letters expressing discontent. Complaints pointed out that the Millennium Bridge in London did not have similar piles, and that a Newcastle University boat race had to be moved specifically to avoid potential collision with the piles. Over time, Gateshead Council and the Harbourmaster noted that the piles were not required and they were removed in 2012 by BAM Nuttall Limited. This decision was ultimately less expensive than maintaining them.

== Regional and cultural significance ==
Gateshead Millennium Bridge has retained its status as a significant local landmark and tourist attraction, not only built to develop the local area but also to establish local pride. It is one of several cultural landmarks on Gateshead Quays, including Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art and Sage Gateshead. It opens periodically for sightseers and for major events such as The Boat Race of the North and the Cutty Sark Tall Ships&#x27; Race. The bridge also lights up to mark celebrations or dedications. For example, it was lit blue on 4 July 2020 as part of the &#x27;Light it Blue&#x27; campaign celebrating the 72nd anniversary of the NHS and its contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was also lit green in April 2020 in recognition of social care workers.

The bridge has been featured in film and on TV including the BBC TV drama &quot;55 Degrees North&quot; and the British 2005 film &quot;Goal!&quot;. On 17 July 2005, Spencer Tunick used the bridge in an art installation: 1,700 people gathered together nude and were photographed around the Millennium and Tyne Bridges and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. The bridge was pictured on a first-class stamp in 2000, and a pound coin depicting the bridge was produced by the Royal Mint in 2007.

=== Awards ===
Gateshead Millennium Bridge has won a total of 25 awards for design and lighting. For the construction of the bridge, the architect WilkinsonEyre won the 2002 Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Stirling Prize. This was a somewhat controversial decision; although the RIBA judges described the bridge as a &quot;truly heroic piece of engineering and construction&quot;, there was debate among the attendees of the awards ceremony as to whether it also counted as architecture, with some claiming that it was not a building. However, Jim Eyre of WilkinsonEyre argued that the feat did cross over into the boundary of architecture. WilkinsonEyre and Gifford also won the 2003 IStructE Supreme Award. The bridge was awarded the British Constructional Steelwork Association&#x27;s Structural Steel Design Award in 2002. In 2005, the bridge received the Outstanding Structure Award from the International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering.

<text>Gerhard &quot;George&quot; Lachmann Mosse (September 20, 1918 – January 22, 1999) was a German-American social and cultural historian, who emigrated from Nazi Germany to Great Britain and then to the United States. He was professor of history at the University of Iowa, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and also in Israel, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Best known for his studies of Nazism, he authored more than 25 books on topics as diverse as constitutional history, Protestant theology, and the history of masculinity. In 1966, he and Walter Laqueur founded &quot;The Journal of Contemporary History&quot;, which they co-edited.

==Biography==
===Family and early years===
Mosse was born in Berlin to a prominent, well-to-do German Jewish family. His mother Felicia (1888–1972) was the only daughter of the publisher and philanthropist Rudolf Mosse, the son of a doctor imprisoned for revolutionary activity in 1848, and the founder of a publishing empire that included the leading, and liberal, newspapers the &quot;Berliner Morgen-Zeitung&quot; and &quot;Berliner Tageblatt.&quot; These were the most highly regarded and prestigious papers produced by the big three of Berlin publishing during the Weimar Republic, Ullstein, Scherl (taken over by Hugenberg), and Mosse.

A maternal uncle, Albert Mosse, a constitutional scholar, had helped frame Japan&#x27;s Meiji Constitution. Mosse believed there was photograph from the year 1936 in which Hermann Göring and the Japanese Crown Prince (possibly confused by Mosse with the 1937 visit of Prince Chichibu) stand before his uncle&#x27;s grave in the Jewish cemetery in Schönhauser Allee.

Mosse&#x27;s father Hans Lachmann (1885–1944) (he adopted the double-barrel Lachmann-Mosse following his marriage) was the grandson of a wealthy and religious Jewish grain merchant. He rose to manage his father-in-law&#x27;s media empire. In 1923 he commissioned the architect Erich Mendelsohn to redesign the iconic Mossehaus where the &quot;Tageblatt&quot; was published (the building was restored in the 1990s).

In his autobiography, Mosse described himself as a mischievous child given to pranks. He was educated at the noted Mommsen-Gymnasium in Berlin and from 1928 onwards at Schule Schloss Salem, a famously spartan boarding school that exposed the scions of rich and powerful families to a life devoid of privilege. The headmaster at Salem, Kurt Hahn, was an advocate of experiential education and required all pupils to engage in physically challenging outdoor activities. Although Mosse disliked the school&#x27;s nationalistic ethos, he conceded that its emphasis on character building and leadership gave him &quot;some backbone.&quot; He preferred individual sports, such as skiing, to team activities.

===Emigration===
Mosse described his parents, who practiced Reform Judaism and were anti-Zionist, as being, in their own minds, completely integrated as Germans (&quot;gänzlich eingedeutscht&quot;). He suggested that they did not take seriously the threat posed by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis until henchmen of the new regime forced his father, at gunpoint, to sign over control of the publishing house. Mosse may have been speaking metaphorically: his father in April 1933 had left for Paris seeking refuge, not only from the Nazis but also from business creditors. In the wake of the global financial crisis, these had foreclosed on the publisher the previous autumn.

Insolvency could not be avoided, and the regime seized the opportunity to force a transfer of ownership. In Paris, Lachmann-Mosse received an invitation from Hermann Göring to return to the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; as its business manager with the protective status of an Honorary Aryan (&quot;Ehrenarier&quot;); Mosse suspected that the motive was to wrest control of the network of foreign press agencies and offices that had remained in the family&#x27;s possession. His father spurned the offer and never returned to Germany.

With his wife and children in Switzerland, from Paris Mosse-Lachmann secured a divorce and married Karola Strauch (the mother of Harvard physicist Karl Strauch). In 1941 the couple moved to California where his father died, a celebrated patron of the arts, in 1944.

From Switzerland, Mosse moved to England, where he enrolled at the Quaker Bootham School in York. It was here, according to his autobiography, that he first became aware of his homosexuality. A struggling student, he failed several exams, but with the financial support of his parents he was admitted to study history at Downing College, Cambridge, in 1937. Here he first developed an interest in historical scholarship, attending lectures by G. M. Trevelyan and Helen Maude Cam.

===The United States===
In 1939, Mosse&#x27;s family relocated to the United States, and he continued his undergraduate studies at the Quaker Haverford College, earning a B.A. in 1941. He went on to graduate studies at Harvard University, where he benefited from a scholarship reserved for students born in Berlin-Charlottenburg. His 1946 PhD dissertation on English constitutional history of the 16th and 17th centuries, supervised by Charles Howard McIlwain, was subsequently published as &quot;The Struggle for Sovereignty in England&quot; (1950).

With others of what he describes politically as the &quot;Spanish Civil War generation&quot;, Mosse was a member of the Socialist Club at Harvard. They were, he concedes, naive about the nature of the Soviet Union, seen first and foremost as the opponent of fascism, and the indispensable ally against Hitler.

Mosse&#x27;s first academic appointment as an historian was at the University of Iowa, where he focused on religion in early modern Europe and published a concise study of the Reformation that became a widely used textbook. Here he organized opposition to McCarthyism and, in 1948, support for the Progressive Party presidential campaign of Henry A. Wallace. Despite being in the center of a conservative farm state, he experienced no personal repercussions. Against Joseph McCarthy he found allies among conservative Republicans who regarded the red-baiting senator as a &quot;disruptive radical&quot;.

In 1955, Mosse moved to the University of Wisconsin–Madison and began to lecture on modern history. His &quot;The Culture of Western Europe: The Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, an Introduction&quot; (1961), which summarizes these lectures, was also widely adopted as a textbook.

Mosse taught for more than thirty years at the University of Wisconsin, where he was named a John C. Bascom Professor of European History and a Weinstein-Bascom Professor of Jewish Studies, while concurrently holding the Koebner Professorship of History at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Beginning in 1969, Mosse spent one semester each year teaching at the Hebrew University. He also held appointments as a visiting professor at the University of Tel Aviv and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. After retiring from the University of Wisconsin in 1989, he taught at Cambridge University and Cornell University. He was named the first research historian in residence at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

==Scholarship==
Mosse&#x27;s first published work was a 1947 paper in the &quot;Economic History Review&quot; describing the Anti-Corn Law League. He claimed that this was the first time the landed gentry had tried to organize a mass movement in order to counter their opponents. In &quot;The Holy Pretence&quot; (1957), he suggested that a thin line divides truth and falsehood in Puritan casuistry. Mosse declared that he approached history not as narrative, but as a series of questions and possible answers. The narrative provides the framework within which the problem of interest can be addressed. A constant theme in his work is the fate of liberalism. Critics pointed out that he had made Lord Chief Justice Sir Edward Coke, the chief character of his book &quot;The Struggle for Sovereignty in England&quot; (1950), into a liberal long before liberalism had come into existence. Reviewers noted that the sub-text in his &quot;The Culture of Western Europe&quot; (1961) was the triumph of totalitarianism over liberalism.

His most well-known book, &quot;The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich&quot; (1964), analyzes the origins of the nationalist belief system. Mosse claimed, however, that it was not until his book &quot;The Nationalization of the Masses&quot; (1975), which dealt with the sacralization of politics, that he began to put his own stamp upon the analysis of cultural history. He started to write it in the Jerusalem apartment of the historian Jacob Talmon, surrounded by the works of Rousseau. Mosse sought to draw attention to the role played by myth, symbol, and political liturgy in the French Revolution. Rousseau, he noted, went from believing that &quot;the people&quot; could govern themselves in town meetings, to urging that the government of Poland invent public ceremonies and festivals in order to imbue the people with allegiance to the nation. Mosse argued that there was a continuity between his work on the Reformation and his work on more recent history. He claimed that it was not a big step from Christian belief systems to modern civic religions such as nationalism.

In &quot;The Crisis of German Ideology&quot;, he traced how the &quot;German Revolution&quot; became anti-Jewish, and in &quot;Toward the Final Solution&quot; (1979) he wrote a general history of racism in Europe. He argued that although racism was originally directed towards blacks, it was subsequently applied to Jews. In &quot;Nationalism and Sexuality: Respectable and Abnormal Sexuality in Modern Europe&quot; (1985), he claimed that there was a link between male eros, the German youth movement, and &quot;völkisch&quot; thought. Because of the dominance of the male image in so much nationalism, he decided to write the history of that stereotype in &quot;The Image of Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity&quot; (1996).

Mosse saw nationalism, which often includes racism, as the chief menace of modern times. As a Jew, he regarded the rejection of the Age of Enlightenment in Europe as a personal threat, as it was the Enlightenment spirit which had liberated the Jews. He noted that European nationalism had initially tried to combine patriotism, human rights, cosmopolitanism, and tolerance. It was only later that France and then Germany came to believe that they had a monopoly on virtue. In developing this view Mosse was influenced by Peter Viereck, who argued that the turn towards aggressive nationalism first arose in the era of Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Ernst Moritz Arndt. Mosse traced the origins of Nazism in &quot;völkisch&quot; ideology back to a 19th-century organicist worldview that fused pseudo-scientific nature philosophy with mystical notions of a &quot;German soul&quot;. The Nazis made &quot;völkisch&quot; thinking accessible to the broader public via potent rhetoric, powerful symbols, and mass rituals. Mosse demonstrated that antisemitism drew on stereotypes that depicted the Jew as the enemy of the German &quot;Volk&quot;, an embodiment of the urban, materialistic, scientific culture that was supposedly responsible for the corruption of the German spirit.

In &quot;Toward the Final Solution&quot;, he claimed that racial stereotypes were rooted in the European tendency to classify human beings according to their closeness or distance from Greek ideals of beauty. &quot;Nationalism and Sexuality: Middle-Class Morality and Sexual Norms in Modern Europe&quot; extended these insights to encompass other excluded or persecuted groups: Jews, homosexuals, Romani people, and the mentally ill. Many 19th-century thinkers relied upon binary stereotypes that categorized human beings either as &quot;healthy&quot; or &quot;degenerate&quot;, &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot;, &quot;insiders&quot; or &quot;outsiders&quot;. In &quot;The Image of Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity&quot;, Mosse argued that middle-class male respectability evoked &quot;counter-type&quot; images of men whose weakness, nervousness, and effeminacy threatened to undermine an ideal of manhood.

Mosse&#x27;s upbringing attuned him to both the advantages and the dangers of a humanistic education. His book &quot;German Jews beyond Judaism&quot; (1985) describes how the German-Jewish dedication to &quot;Bildung&quot;, or cultivation, helped Jews to transcend their group identity. But it also argues that during the Weimar Republic, &quot;Bildung&quot; contributed to a blindness toward the illiberal political realities that later engulfed Jewish families. Mosse&#x27;s liberalism also informed his supportive but critical stance toward Zionism and the State of Israel. In an essay written on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Zionism, he wrote that the early Zionists envisioned a liberal commonwealth based on individualism and solidarity, but a &quot;more aggressive, exclusionary and normative nationalism eventually came to the fore.&quot;

Historian James Franklin argues that:
: as a teacher and scholar, George Mosse has posed challenging questions about what it means to be an intellectual engaged in the world. The central problem Mosse has examined throughout his career is: how do intellectuals relate their ideas to reality or to alternative views of that reality?... Mosse has chosen to focus on intellectuals and the movements with which they were often connected at their most intemperate... For Mosse, the role of the historian is one of political engagement; he or she must delineate the connections (and disconnections) between myth and reality.

==Distinction as a teacher==
At the University of Wisconsin, Mosse was recognized as a charismatic and inspiring teacher. Tom Bates&#x27;s &quot;Rads: A True Story of the End of the Sixties&quot; (1992) describes how students flocked to Mosse&#x27;s courses to &quot;savor the crossfire&quot; with his friend and rival, the Marxist historian Harvey Goldberg. Mosse charmed his students by mingling critical skepticism with humor, irony, and empathy; but they also admired the way he applied his historical knowledge to contemporary issues, attempting to be fair to opposing views while remaining true to his own principles. He served as director for 38 Ph.D. dissertations.

==Legacy==
Mosse left a substantial bequest to the University of Wisconsin–Madison to establish the George L. Mosse Program in History, a collaborative program with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He also left modest endowments to support LGBT studies at both the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the University of Amsterdam, where he taught as a visiting professor. These endowments were funded by the restitution of the Mosse family&#x27;s properties that were expropriated by the Nazi regime and restored in 1989–1990, following the collapse of East Germany. The George Mosse Fund was created at the University of Amsterdam to further the advancement of gay and lesbian studies. The American Historical Association annually awards the George L. Mosse Prize.

<doc id="547505" wikidata="Q5933763" url="?curid=547505" title="Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist is given each year for artists of works related to science fiction or fantasy released in the previous calendar year. The award has been given annually under several names since 1955, with the exception of 1957. The Hugo Awards have been described as &quot;a fine showcase for speculative fiction&quot; and &quot;the best known literary award for science fiction writing&quot;.

The inaugural 1953 Hugo awards recognized &quot;Best Interior Illustrator&quot; and &quot;Best Cover Artist&quot; categories, awarded to Virgil Finlay and a tie between Hannes Bok and Ed Emshwiller, respectively. The Best Professional Artist award was simply named &quot;Best Artist&quot; in 1955 and 1956, was not awarded in 1957, and was named &quot;Outstanding Artist&quot; in 1958, finally changing to its current name the following year. Beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954, and in each case an award for professional artist was given.

During the 77 nomination years, 98 artists have been nominated; 26 of these have won, including co-winners and Retro Hugos. Michael Whelan has received the most awards, with 13 wins out of 24 nominations. Frank Kelly Freas has 11 wins and 28 nominations, the most nominations of any artist. Other artists with large numbers of wins or nominations include Bob Eggleton with 8 wins out of 23 nominations, Virgil Finlay with 5 out of 14, Ed Emshwiller with 4 out of 9, John Picacio with 3 out of 15, and Don Maitz with 2 out of 17. David A. Cherry and Thomas Canty are tied for the most nominations without an award at 10 each.

==Selection==
Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The awards in 1955 and 1958 did not include any recognition of runner-up artists, but since 1959 all six candidates have been recorded. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near Labor Day, and in a different city around the world each year.

== Winners and nominees ==
In the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Artists are eligible based on their work of the previous calendar year. Entries with a yellow background and an asterisk (*) next to the artist&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a gray background are the nominees on the short-list.

  *   Winners

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years in which a Worldcon was hosted, but no awards were originally given. Retro Hugos have been awarded eight times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

<text>Jennifer Trynin (born 1963), is an American singer-songwriter and author from Boston, Massachusetts.

== Career ==
She recorded her debut album &quot;Cockamamie&quot; in 1994 while running her own desktop publishing business. The track &quot;Better Than Nothing&quot; received considerable airplay on alternative rock radio stations across the United States. She later released her second album, &quot;Gun Shy Trigger Happy&quot;, in 1997. Trynin would later release a book entitled &quot;Everything I&#x27;m Cracked Up to Be&quot; in 2006 about her experience in the music industry.

Trynin played guitar for Dave Wanamaker&#x27;s band Loveless, who released an album, &quot;Gift to the World&quot;, in 2003. After Loveless broke up, she took a break from music to raise her daughter.

In 2015, Trynin formed the band Cujo and began playing semi-regularly at small clubs in and around Boston.

In 2018, Trynin joined Band of Their Own, an all-female supergroup formed to perform at Hot Stove Cool Music, the annual benefit show supporting the Foundation to be Named Later, the charity established by former Boston Red Sox and current Chicago Cubs executive Theo Epstein and his twin brother Paul Epstein. Band of Their Own also features among others Kay Hanley, Freda Love Smith, Tanya Donelly, Gail Greenwood, Magen Tracy, and Jennifer D&#x27;Angora. In keeping with the baseball and all-female theme, they chose the name &quot;Band of Their Own&quot; as a tribute to the documentary and subsequent film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League; the band&#x27;s logo, designed by Greenwood, is modeled on the logo of the AAGPBL.

==Personal life==

Trynin married Q Division Studios co-founder Mike Denneen, who produced &quot;Cockamamie&quot;, &quot;Gun Shy Trigger Happy&quot;, and &quot;Gift to the World&quot;, in 2000. Their daughter, Grace Trynin Denneen, was born in 2003. They remained married until his death from colon cancer in July 2018.

In November 2018, as a tribute to her late husband, Trynin and her daughter performed &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom,&quot; a hit song that Denneen produced for Fountains of Wayne, with Letters to Cleo at the Paradise Rock Club in Boston, featuring Grace on lead vocals. They performed the same tribute with Band of Their Own at Hot Stove Cool Music in February 2019, also at the Paradise Rock Club and again with Grace on lead vocals.

She is of Jewish origin and her husband was a non-practicing Catholic.

<text>Marcello José das Neves Alves Caetano (; 17 August 1906 – 26 October 1980) was a Portuguese politician and scholar. He was the second and last leader of the Estado Novo after succeeding António de Oliveira Salazar. He served as prime minister from 1968 to 1974, when he was overthrown during the Carnation Revolution.

== Early life and career ==
He was the son of José Maria de Almeida Alves Caetano and his first wife Josefa Maria das Neves. Graduated as a Licentiate and later a Doctorate in Law, Caetano was a Cathedratic Professor at the Faculty of Law of the University of Lisbon. A conservative politician and a self-proclaimed reactionary in his youth, Caetano started his political career in the 1930s, during the early days of the regime of António de Oliveira Salazar.

Caetano soon became an important figure in the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; government, and in 1940, he was appointed chief of the Portuguese Youth Organisation. Caetano progressed in his academic career at the university, published several works and lectured law. In jail for political reasons, Álvaro Cunhal, a law student, the future leader of the Portuguese Communist Party, submitted his final thesis on the topic of abortion before a faculty jury that included Caetano.

Between 1944 and 1947, Caetano was minister of the colonies, and in 1947, he became the president of the executive board of the National Union. He also served as president of the Corporative Chamber between 1949 and 1955.

From 1955 to 1958, he was the minister attached to the presidency of the Council of Ministers and was the most powerful man in the regime after Salazar, who was approaching the age of retirement. Their relationship was tense at times, which stopped Caetano from being a clear successor. He returned to his academic career and maintained formally-important political functions such as the executive president of the National Union, Caetano became the ninth rector of the University of Lisbon from 1959, but the Academic Crisis of 1962 led him to resign after protesting students clashed with riot police in the campus. On the other hand, students who supported the regime tried to boycott the anti-regime activism. There were indeed three generations of militants of the radical right at the Portuguese universities and schools between 1945 and 1974 who were guided by a revolutionary nationalism partly influenced by the political subculture of European neofascism. The core of these radical students&#x27; struggle lay in an uncompromising defence of the Portuguese Empire in the days of the fascist regime.

== Prime minister ==
In August 1968, Salazar suffered a stroke after a fall in his home and went into a coma. After 36 years in office, the 79-year-old was dismissed by President Américo Thomaz. Thomaz appointed Caetano to replace Salazar on 27 September 1968. However, no one informed the recovered Salazar that he had been removed as leader of the regime that he had largely created. By some accounts, when Salazar died in July 1970, he still believed &quot;he&quot; was prime minister.

Many people hoped that Caetano would soften the edges of Salazar&#x27;s authoritarian regime and modernise the economy. Caetano moved to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. The three objectives of Caetano&#x27;s pension reform were to enhance equity, reduce the fiscal and actuarial imbalance and achieve more efficiency for the economy as a whole such as by establishing contributions that were less distortive to labour markets and allowing the savings generated by pension funds to increase the investments in the economy. Some large-scale investments were made at the national level, such as the building of a major oil processing center in Sines.

The economy reacted very well at first, but in the 1970s, some serious problems began to show, partly because double-digit inflation started 1970 and partly because of the short-term effects of the 1973 oil crisis despite the largely-unexploited oil reserves, which Portugal had in its overseas territories in Angola and São Tomé and Príncipe that were being developed and promised to become sources of wealth in the medium to long term.

Caetano&#x27;s political power was largely held in check by Thomaz. On paper, the president&#x27;s power to remove Salazar had been the only check on his power. Thomaz, like his predecessors, had largely been a figurehead under Salazar, but he was not willing to give as free a hand to Caetano.

Although Caetano had been one of the architects of the Estado Novo, he took some steps to blunt the harsher edges of the regime in the so-called &quot;political spring&quot; (also called Marcellist Spring – &#x27;). He referred to his regime as a &quot;social state&quot; and changed the name of the official party, the National Union to the &quot;People&#x27;s National Action&quot; &quot;()&quot;. The PIDE, the dreaded secret police, was renamed the DGS (&#x27;, General-Directorate of Security). He also eased press censorship and allowed the first independent labor unions since the 1920s. The opposition was allowed to run in the 1969 election.

Even with those reforms, the conduct of the 1969 and 1973 legislative elections was little different from past elections over the previous 40 years. The opposition was barely tolerated. While opposition candidates were theoretically allowed to stand (as had been the case since 1945), they were subjected to harsh repression. In both elections, the People&#x27;s National Action swept every seat. The was considered as not a chamber for parties but popular representatives, who were chosen and elected on a single list. In the only presidential election held under Caetano, in 1972, Thomaz was elected unopposed by the government-controlled legislature.

The reforms did not go nearly far enough for large elements of the population that were eager for more freedom and had no memory of the instability that preceded Salazar. However, even those reforms had to be extracted with some effort from the more hardline members of the government, especially Thomaz.

At bottom, Caetano was still an authoritarian himself, as evidenced by the heavy-handed repression of opposition figures. He was very disappointed when the opposition was not content with the meager reforms he was able to wring out of the hardliners. After the 1973 elections, the regime&#x27;s hardliners used their proximity to Thomaz to pressure Caetano into abandoning his reform experiment. He had little choice but to acquiesce, since he had spent nearly all of his political capital to enact his reforms in the first place.
Since the early 1960s, the Portuguese overseas provinces in Africa had been struggling for independence, but the government in Lisbon, was not willing to concede it, and Salazar sent troops to fight the guerrillas and the terrorism of the independence movements. By 1970, the war in Africa was consuming as much as 40% of the Portuguese budget, and there was no solution in sight. At a military level, despite the containment of the various independence movements with differentiating levels of success, their impending presence and their failure to disappear dominated public anxiety. Throughout the war, Portugal also faced increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community.

After spending the early years of his priesthood in Africa, the British priest Adrian Hastings created a storm in 1973 with an article in &quot;The Times&quot; about the &quot;Wiriyamu Massacre&quot; in Mozambique. He revealed that the Portuguese Army had massacred 400 villagers in the village of Wiriyamu, near Tete, in December 1972.

His report was printed a week before Caetano was supposed to visit Britain to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance. Portugal&#x27;s growing isolation following Hastings&#x27;s claims has often been cited as a factor that helped to bring about the Carnation Revolution, a coup that deposed Caetano&#x27;s regime in 1974.

By the early 1970s, the counterinsurgency war had been won in Angola, it was less than satisfactorily contained in Mozambique and dangerously stalemated in Portuguese Guinea and so the Portuguese government decided to create sustainability policies to allow continuous sources of financing for the war effort for the long run. On 13 November 1972, a sovereign wealth fund, the &quot;Fundo do Ultramar&quot; (Overseas Fund) was enacted to finance the counterinsurgency effort in the Portuguese overseas territories. In addition, new decree laws (&quot;Decretos-Leis n.os 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto&quot;) were enforced to reduce military expenses and increase the number of officers by incorporating irregular militia as if they were regular military academy officers.

==Overthrow==

By the beginning of 1974, signals of rebellion increased. The Armed Forces Movement was formed within the army and started planning a coup to end the regime. In March, an unsuccessful attempt against the regime was made. By then, Caetano had offered his resignation to the president more than once but his request was denied. There was now little attempt or political possibility of controlling the movements of the opposition.

On 25 April 1974, the military overthrew the regime in the Carnation Revolution. Caetano resigned and was taken into military custody.

The combined African independentist guerrilla forces of the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) in Angola; the PAIGC in Portuguese Guinea and the FRELIMO in Mozambique succeeded in their nationalistic rebellion when their continued guerrilla warfare prompted elements of the Portuguese Armed Forces to stage a coup at Lisbon in 1974.

The Armed Forces Movement overthrew the Lisbon government as a protest against the ongoing war in Portuguese Guinea that seemed to have no military end in sight, to rebel against the new military laws that were to be presented the next year (&quot;Decretos-Leis n.os 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto&quot;), to reduce military expenses and to incorporate militia and military academy officers in the army branches as equals.

==Later life==
After Caetano had resigned, he was flown under custody to the Madeira Islands, where he stayed for a few days. He then flew to exile to Brazil, which was ruled by its own dictatorship. In Brazil, he continued his academic activity as director of the Institute of Comparative Law at Gama Filho University in Rio de Janeiro. He died in Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro of a heart attack in 1980. His body was buried in the São João Batista Cemetery, in Botafogo.

==Publications==
Caetano published several books, including several highly-rated law books and two books of memoirs in exile: &quot;&quot; (My Memories of Salazar) and &quot;Depoimento&quot; (Testimony).

He was one of the world&#x27;s greatest authorities in administrative law, and some of his works were studied even in Soviet universities. He also wrote &quot;Os nativos na economía africana&quot; in 1954. During his exile in Brazil, he pursued academic activities and published works on administrative and constitutional law.

==Personal life==
On 27 October 1930, Caetano married Maria Teresa Teixeira de Queirós de Barros (23 July 1906 – 14 January 1971), the sister of the antifascist politician Henrique de Barros, the only President of the Constituent Assembly of Portugal, the daughter of writer and his wife, Raquel Teixeira de Queirós; and the paternal granddaughter of the first viscount of Marinha Grande . He had four children:

<doc id="547527" wikidata="Q231402" url="?curid=547527" title="Jacques Monod">
<text>Jacques Lucien Monod (; 9 February 1910 – 31 May 1976) was a French biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1965, sharing it with François Jacob and André Lwoff &quot;for their discoveries concerning genetic control of enzyme and virus synthesis&quot;.

Monod and Jacob became famous for their work on the &quot;E. coli&quot; &quot;lac&quot; operon, which encodes proteins necessary for the transport and breakdown of the sugar lactose (lac). From their own work and the work of others, they came up with a model for how the levels of some proteins in a cell are controlled. In their model, the manufacture of a set of related proteins, such as the ones encoded within the &quot;lac&quot; (lactose) operon, is prevented when a repressor protein, encoded by a regulatory gene, binds to its operator, a specific site in the DNA sequence that is close to the genes encoding the proteins. (It is now known that a repressor bound to an operator physically blocks RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, the site where transcription of the adjacent genes begins.)

Study of the control of expression of genes in the &quot;lac&quot; operon provided the first example of a system for the regulation of transcription. Monod also suggested the existence of messenger RNA molecules that link the information encoded in DNA and proteins. For these contributions he is widely regarded as one of the founders of molecular biology.

== Career and research ==
As a student at the University of Paris, Monod discovered that the coursework was decades behind the current biological science. He learned from other students a little older than himself, rather than from the faculty. &quot;To George Teissier he owes a preference for quantitative descriptions; André Lwoff initiated him into the potentials of microbiology; to Boris Ephrussi he owes the discovery of physiological genetics, and to Louis Rapkine the concept that only chemical and molecular descriptions could provide a complete interpretation of the function of living organisms.&quot;

Before his doctoral work, Monod spent a year in the laboratory of Thomas Hunt Morgan at the California Institute of Technology working on Drosophila genetics. This was a true revelation for him and probably influenced him on developing a genetic conception of biochemistry and metabolism.

Monod&#x27;s interest in the &quot;lac&quot; operon originated from his doctoral dissertation, which explored the growth of bacteria on mixtures of sugars and documented the sequential utilization of two or more sugars. The work was conducted at the University of Paris, with André Lwoff of the Pasteur Institute having provided important advice. Monod coined the term diauxie to denote the frequent observations of two distinct growth phases of bacteria grown on two sugars. He theorized on the growth of bacterial cultures and promoted the chemostat theory as a powerful continuous culture system to investigate bacterial physiology.

Monod joined the Pasteur Institute in 1943 and Jacob in 1949. The experimental system ultimately used by Jacob and Monod was a common bacterium, &quot;E. coli&quot;, but the basic regulatory concept (described in the Lac operon article) that was discovered by Jacob and Monod is fundamental to cellular regulation for all organisms. The key idea is that &quot;E. coli&quot; does not waste energy making such enzymes if there is no need to metabolize lactose, such as when other sugars like glucose are available. The type of regulation is called negative gene regulation, as the operon is inactivated by a protein complex that is removed in the presence of lactose (regulatory induction).

With Jean-Pierre Changeux and François Jacob, Monod proposed a theory of allosteric transitions to explain how conformational effects could allow enzyme effectors that are structurally quite different from the enzyme&#x27;s substrates and products to activate or inhibit the reaction: binding at an &quot;allosteric site&quot; of the enzyme remote from the active site could bring about a change at the active site. He made an important contribution to enzymology when he collaborated with Jeffries Wyman and Changeux to extend this concept to explain cooperative behaviour of some multi-subunit proteins. This has become the most widely accepted explanation of cooperativity.

== Philosophical contributions ==
Monod was not only a biologist but also a musician and writer on the philosophy of science. He was a political activist and chief of staff of operations for the Forces Françaises de l&#x27;Interieur during World War II. In preparation for the Allied landings, he arranged parachute drops of weapons, railroad bombings, and mail interceptions.

In 1970, Monod published &quot;Le hasard et la nécessité&quot; – English translation &quot;Chance and Necessity&quot; (1971) –, a book based on a series of lectures that he had given at Pomona College in 1969. The book is a short but influential examination of the philosophical implications of modern biology, written for a general readership. Monod acknowledges his connection to the French existentialists in the epigraph of the book, which quotes the final paragraphs of Camus&#x27;s &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;. In summarizing recent progress in several areas of biology, including his own research, Monod highlights the ways in which information is found to take physical form and hence become capable of influencing events in the world. For example, the information allowing a protein enzyme to &quot;select&quot; only one of several similar compounds as the substrate of a chemical reaction is encoded in the precise three-dimensional shape of the enzyme; that precise shape is itself encoded by the linear sequence of amino acids constituting the protein; and that particular sequence of amino acids is encoded by the sequence of nucleotides in the gene for that enzyme.

In the title of the book, &quot;necessity&quot; refers to the fact that the enzyme &quot;must&quot; act as it does, catalyzing a reaction with one substrate but not another, according to the constraints imposed by its structure. While the enzyme itself cannot be said in any meaningful way to have a choice about its activity, the thrust of Jacob and Monod&#x27;s Nobel prize-winning research was to show how a bacterial cell can &quot;choose&quot; whether or not to carry out the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. As Monod explains, one way the cell can make such a choice is by either synthesizing the enzyme or not, in response to its chemical environment. However, the synthesis/no synthesis choice is in turn governed by necessary biochemical interactions between a repressor protein, the gene for the enzyme, and the substrate of the enzyme, which interact so that the outcome (enzyme synthesis or not) differs according to the variable composition of the cell&#x27;s chemical environment. The hierarchical, modular organization of this system clearly implies that additional regulatory elements can exist that govern, are governed by, or otherwise interact with any given set of regulatory components. Because, in general, the bacterial activity that results from these regulatory circuits is in accord with what is beneficial for the bacterial cell&#x27;s survival at that time, the bacterium as a whole can be described as making rational choices, even though the bacterial components involved in deciding whether to make an enzyme (repressor, gene, and substrate) have no more choice about their activities than does the enzyme itself.

Monod shows a paradigm of how choice at one level of biological organization (metabolic activity) is generated by necessary (choiceless) interactions at another level (gene regulation); the ability to choose arises from a complex system of feedback loops that connect these interactions. He goes on to explain how the capacity of biological systems to retain information, combined with chance variations during the replication of information (i.e. genetic mutations) that are individually rare but commonplace in aggregate, leads to the differential preservation of that information which is most successful at maintaining and replicating itself. Monod writes that this process, acting over long periods of time, is a sufficient explanation (indeed the only plausible explanation) for the complexity and teleonomic activity of the biosphere. Hence, the combined effects of chance and necessity, which are amenable to scientific investigation, account for our existence and the universe we inhabit, without the need to invoke mystical, supernatural, or religious explanations.

While acknowledging the likely evolutionary origin of a human need for explanatory myths, in the final chapter of &quot;Chance and Necessity&quot; Monod advocates an objective (hence value-free) scientific worldview as a guide to assessing truth. He describes this as an &quot;ethics of knowledge&quot; that disrupts the older philosophical, mythological and religious ontologies, which claim to provide both ethical values and a standard for judging truth. For Monod, assessing truth separate from any value judgement is what frees human beings to act authentically, by requiring that they &quot;choose&quot; the ethical values that motivate their actions. He concludes that &quot;man at last knows he is alone in the unfeeling immensity of the universe, out of which he has emerged only by chance. His destiny is nowhere spelled out, nor is his duty. The kingdom above or the darkness below: it is for him to choose&quot;. While apparently bleak, in comparison to the concepts that humanity belongs to some inevitable, universal process, or that a benevolent God created and protects us, an acceptance of the scientific assessment described in the first part of the quotation is, for Monod, the only possible basis of an authentic, ethical human life. It is reasonable to conclude that Monod himself did not find this position bleak; the quotation he chose from Camus to introduce &quot;Chance and Necessity&quot; ends with the sentence: &quot;One must imagine Sisyphus happy.&quot;

In 1973, Jacques Monod was one of the signatories of the Humanist Manifesto II.

Sociologist Howard L. Kaye has suggested that Monod failed in his attempt to banish &quot;mind and purpose from the phenomenon of life&quot; in the name of science. It may be more accurate to suggest that Monod sought to include mind and purpose within the purview of scientific investigation, rather than attributing them to supernatural or divine causes. While Monod does not explicitly address mind or consciousness, his scientific research demonstrated that biology includes feedback loops that govern interacting systems of biochemical reactions, so that the system as a whole can be described as having a purpose and making choices. Monod&#x27;s philosophical writing indicates that he recognized the implication that such systems could arise and be elaborated upon by evolution through natural selection. The importance of Monod&#x27;s work as a bridge between the chance and necessity of evolution and biochemistry on the one hand, and the human realm of choice and ethics on the other, can be judged by his influence on philosophers, biologists and computer scientists such as Daniel Dennett, Douglas Hofstadter, Marvin Minsky and Richard Dawkins.

==Awards and honours==
In addition to sharing a Nobel Prize, Monod was also a recipient of the Légion d&#x27;honneur and elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1968. The Institut Jacques Monod, funded jointly by the CNRS and the University of Paris, is one of the main centers for basic research in biology in the Paris area. It is headed by Michel Werner, Research Director.

== Personal life ==
Monod was born in Paris to an American mother from Milwaukee, Charlotte (Sharlie) MacGregor Todd, and a French Huguenot father, Lucien Monod, who was a painter and inspired him artistically and intellectually. He attended the &quot;lycée&quot; at Cannes until he was 18. In October 1928 he started his studies in biology at the University of Paris. 

In 1938 he married Odette Bruhl (d.1972).

During World War II, Monod was active in the French Resistance, eventually becoming the chief of staff of the French Forces of the Interior. He was a Chevalier in the Légion d&#x27;Honneur (1945) and was awarded the Croix de Guerre (1945) and the American Bronze Star Medal. Monod became a member of the French Communist Party after the end of the Second World War, but distanced himself from the party after the Lysenko Affair. He became a close friend of Albert Camus, Nobel laureate in literature who had also been active in the French Resistance and shared Monod&#x27;s criticism of the Soviet system.

Monod, then a professor at the University of Paris, supported the student protests of May 68 and, along with several fellow Nobel laureates, appealed to president Charles de Gaulle on the students&#x27; behalf.

Jacques Monod died of leukemia in 1976 and was buried in the Cimetière du Grand Jas in Cannes on the French Riviera.

<text>The Samoan Islands () are an archipelago covering in the central South Pacific, forming part of Polynesia and of the wider region of Oceania. Administratively, the archipelago comprises all of the Independent State of Samoa and most of American Samoa (apart from Swains Island, which is geographically part of the Tokelau Islands). The land masses of the two Samoan jurisdictions are separated by of ocean at their closest points.

The population of the Samoan Islands is approximately 250,000. The inhabitants have in common the Samoan language, a culture known as &quot;fa&#x27;a Samoa,&quot; and an indigenous form of governance called &quot;fa&#x27;amatai&quot;. Samoans are one of the largest Polynesian populations in the world, and most are of exclusively Samoan ancestry.

The oldest known evidence of human activity in the Samoan Islands dates to around 1050 BCE. It comes from a Lapita site at Mulifanua wharf on Upolu island. In 1768, the eastern islands were visited by the French explorer Bougainville, who named them the &quot;Navigator Islands&quot;. That name was used by missionaries until about 1845, and in official European dispatches until about 1870.

== Samoa and American Samoa ==

Politically, the Samoan Islands are divided into two jurisdictions:
* Samoa, an independent nation that gained political independence from New Zealand in 1962. It comprises the western half of the Samoan Islands, ( and 196,000 inhabitants (2016)). It was known as German Samoa from 1900 to 1914, and as Western Samoa until 1997.
**Capital: Apia; currency: Samoan tala.
* American Samoa, an unincorporated territory of the United States comprising the eastern half of the Samoan Islands. ( and 49,710 inhabitants (2020)).
**Capital: Pago Pago; currency: US dollar.

===Political partition===
In the late 19th century, competition for political control of the islands between the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom resulted in the December 1899 Tripartite Convention, which formally partitioned the Samoan archipelago into a German colony (German Samoa) in the western half and a United States territory (American Samoa) in the eastern half. New Zealand began occupying the western islands in World War I, while they were still a German colony and continued as an occupying force until 1920. Then, from 1920 until Samoa&#x27;s independence in 1962, New Zealand governed the islands in that group under a League of Nations Class C Mandate from 1920 to 1946, and as a United Nations Trust Territory from 1946 to 1962. The force that eventually led to the political independence of the western islands in 1962 was the pro-independence Mau movement, which gained popularity across the area. The eastern islands remain a political territory of the United States.

==Islands==

The Samoan Islands has total of 18 islands spread in a west to east direction.

=== Samoa ===
*Savaii: population 43,819 (2016); largest landmass; westernmost in the group; most recent volcanic eruptions. Eruptions:Mt Matavanu (1905–1911); Mata o le Afi (1902); Mauga Afi (approximately 1725).
*Manono: population 889 (2006).
*Nuulopa: uninhabited; lies in the Apolima Strait between Upolu and Savaii. 
*Apolima: population 75 (2006). 
*Upolu: population 143,418 (2011); the most populous island in the group.
*Nuusafee: uninhabited; tiny rocky islet off the south coast of Upolu, near the village of Poutasi.
*Nuutele: uninhabited; volcanic tuff ring; conservation for native birds; can also be seen from the popular Lalomanu Beach.
*Nuulua: uninhabited; volcanic tuff ring; land area ; conservation habitat for endemic native birds.
*Namua: uninhabited
*Fanuatapu: uninhabited; volcanic tuff ring.

The islands of Manono, Apolima and Nuulopa lie in the Apolima Strait between Upolu and Savaii. The four small, uninhabited islands – Nuutele, Nuulua, Namua and Fanuatapu – are situated off the east coast of Upolu and comprise the Aleipata Islands.

=== American Samoa ===
*Tutuila: population 48,405 (per 2020 census); main island in the territory.
*Pola Island: unpopulated; part of the National Park of American Samoa.
*Aunu&#x27;u: population 473 (per 2020 census); located southeast of Tutuila.
*Swains Island: unpopulated (per 2020 census); politically administered by American Samoa, but culturally part of Tokelau; copra plantation.
*Ofu‑Olosega: volcanic doublet encompassing Ofu (population 132, per 2020 census) and Olosega (population 147, per 2020 census); in the Manu&#x27;a Group of islands.
*Ta&#x27;ū: population 236 (per 2020 census); largest island in the Manu&#x27;a Group
*Manu (Rose Atoll): unpopulated (per 2020 census); conservation habitat for native birdlife, marine life, green turtle and endangered hawksbill turtle.
*A number of minor uninhabited islets: Taputapu Island, Nuusetoga Island (Bartlett Island), Nuʻutele Island, Nuusilaelae Island, Pyramid Rock (Fatutoʻaga), Fatu Rock (Flowerpot Rock), Utusiva, Avaio, and Nu’upule Rock.

==Location==

The islands are approximately from Fiji, from Tonga, from New Zealand, and from Hawaii, U.S.

The islands lie between 13° and 14° south latitude and 169° and 173° west longitude, and span an area of about from west to east.

The larger islands are volcanic in origin, mountainous, and covered in tropical moist forest. Some of the smaller islands are coral atolls with black sand beaches.

==Highest points==
The highest point in Samoa is Mt. Silisili, on the island of Savai&#x27;i. At , it is also one of the highest peaks in Polynesia. The highest peak in American Samoa is on Ta’u, Lata Mountain, at .

==Landmass==
Upolu and Savai&#x27;i in Samoa are among the largest of the Polynesian islands, at and , respectively, Their size is exceeded only by the two substantially larger main islands of New Zealand Te Waipounamu and Te Ika-a-Māui as well as Rakiura, and the two main islands of Fiji and the Hawaiian islands of Hawaiʻi and Maui. The island of Upolu has more inhabitants than the island of Savai&#x27;i does.

The next largest island is Tutuila, where the city and harbor of Pago Pago (with a population of 3,519 in 1990) is located. Tutuila is much smaller than Upolu and Savai‘i, at in area, but it is the largest island in American Samoa. The highest point on Tutuila is Matafao Peak.

Smaller islands in the archipelago include the three islets (Manono Island, Apolima and Nu&#x27;ulopa) located in the Apolima Strait between Savai&#x27;i and Upolu; the four Aleipata Islands off the eastern end of Upolu (Nu&#x27;utele, Nu&#x27;ulua, Namua, and Fanuatapu); and Nu‘usafe‘e. Aunu&#x27;u is a small island off the eastern end of Tutuila. To the east of Tutuila, the Manu&#x27;a group comprises Ofu, Olosega, and Ta’u. An uninhabited coral atoll, Rose Atoll, is the southernmost point in the territory of the United States. Another coral atoll, Swains Island, is within the territory of American Samoa but is geographically distant from the Samoan archipelago.

== Time zone ==

In 1892, the Samoan islands shifted to the eastern side of the International Date Line. The ruler Malietoa Laupepa issued a proclamation that Monday, July 4 would occur twice, giving an extra day in July 1892. This change, which occurred on the American Independence Day, was likely due to increasing trade with Americans. The islands would be on the same day as the United States.

By 2011, the government of independent Samoa decided to shift back to the western side in order to have the same day as Australia and New Zealand. Being one day behind these countries, Samoa&#x27;s primary trading partners, left only four business days in a week. The shift was implemented by skipping Friday, December 30; workers were paid for this &quot;missed&quot; day. Neighboring Tokelau shifted as well on this day.

==Geology==
The volcanic Samoa island chain may have been formed by the activity of the Samoa hotspot at the eastern end of the Samoa Islands. In theory, that hotspot was created by the movement of the Pacific tectonic plate over a &#x27;fixed&#x27; deep and narrow mantle plume spewing up through the Earth&#x27;s crust. One piece of evidence that this activity may have created the islands is that they generally lie in a straight east-to-west line, and the plate is moving from east to west. However, some characteristics of the Samoa islands are inconsistent with this theory. The classic hotspot model (based mostly on studies of the Hawaii hotspot) predicts that, if plate movement over a hotspot is what created a volcanic island chain, then the farther away from the hotspot the islands and seamounts in the chain are, the older they will prove to be. Some of the evidence is inconsistent with this explanation for the creation of the Samoa island chain, creating an enigma for scientists. For one thing, Savai&#x27;i, the most western of the Samoa island chain, and Ta&#x27;u Island, the most eastern, both erupted in the last century. For another thing, the subaerial rock samples initially collected from Savai&#x27;i, the westernmost of the islands, are too young by several million years to fit the classic hotspot model of age progression in an island chain. These facts led some scientists to suggest that the Samoa islands were not formed by the hotspot plume. One possible explanation for the inconsistency of the data with the hotspot formation theory is the fact that the island chain lies just north of the Tonga Trench. An alternative theory is that the islands were formed by magma seeping through cracks in stressed fracture zones. However, in 2005, an international team found new evidence that supports the hotspot model. They gathered additional samples from Savai&#x27;i – submarine samples from the deep flanks and rifts of the island. Tests found that these samples are much older than the previously collected samples: They are about five million years old, an age that fits the hotspot model.

===2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami===
The 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami killed more than 170 people in the Samoa Islands and Tonga. The M8.1 submarine earthquake took place in the region at 06:48:11 local time on September 29, 2009 (17:48:11 UTC, September 29), followed by smaller aftershocks. It was the largest earthquake of 2009.

===Vailulu&#x27;u Seamount===
The Vailulu&#x27;u Seamount, an active submerged volcano, lies east of Ta&#x27;u in
American Samoa. It was discovered in 1975 and has since been studied by an international team of scientists, contributing towards understanding of the Earth&#x27;s fundamental processes. Growing inside the summit crater of Vailulu&#x27;u is an active underwater volcanic cone, named after Samoa&#x27;s goddess of war, Nafanua.

==Climate==
The Samoan climate is tropical, with a rainy season from November to April. The island group is frequently hit by tropical cyclones between December and March, due to its position in the South Pacific Ocean.

<doc id="547530" wikidata="Q4913462" url="?curid=547530" title="Billy Whizz">
<text>Billy Whizz is a fictional character featured in the British comic &quot;The Beano&quot;, first appearing in issue 1139, dated 16 May 1964, when it replaced The Country Cuzzins. Billy, the title character, is a boy who can run extraordinarily fast. His speed often causes chaos yet at the same time his ability can prove useful. He also has a younger brother called Alfie Whizz of similar appearance. Alfie is usually shown as a normal boy but occasionally he is shown to be just as fast as his brother.

In strips up until the 1980s, Billy lives in Whizztown rather than Beanotown like most of the other regular characters, however, this later changed and more recent strips place him in Beanotown.

==Character history==

===Concept and creation===
The strip was originated by Malcolm Judge, who had previously drawn &quot;Colonel Crackpot&#x27;s Circus&quot;, and would go on to create several more popular strips, including Ball Boy, The Numskulls and The Badd Lads. Judge&#x27;s style tended to be typified by a wide variety of styles in which Billy&#x27;s speed was depicted, including trails of dust, motion blur, multiple copies of Billy in a panel, and more besides. Later artists tended to use a single, specific visual device to represent Billy&#x27;s whizzing. Judge drew every single Billy Whizz strip until the mid-1980s, when other artists, including Barrie Appleby and Graeme Hill, began providing occasional fill-in strips, though Judge still drew the vast majority of the strips from the conception to 1989.

===Changes in the 1990s===

Upon Judge&#x27;s death in 1989, Appleby acted as artist for a few weeks before Steve Horrocks took over as regular artist. Both Appleby and Horrocks drew in a style that was broadly similar to Judge, but slowly began modernising the strip. Horrocks continued as artist until late 1990, when he was succeeded by Beano newcomer David Parkins, who began a major overhaul of the strip, making the effects of Billy&#x27;s speed more destructive to his surroundings, giving him a more laid-back attitude, and later introducing a rather alien-looking tracksuit.

Parkins acted as the main artist in this time, but Trevor Metcalfe and Vic Neill also drew occasional strips for the next few years; all three artists used a broadly similar design for Billy, but Metcalfe and Neill&#x27;s strips featured a much more happy-go-lucky version of Billy. A reshuffle of the Beano&#x27;s artists (coinciding with the comic&#x27;s move to all-colour printing) saw Parkins leave the strip in 1993, and Neill became the main artist, upon which he began further tweaking Billy&#x27;s appearance, the most notable change being that the two long hairs he had always been drawn with were turned into a thunderbolt. He continued to draw the strip until his death in January 2000, and Graeme Hall took it up afterwards.

===Post-2000===

By March 2003, the strip&#x27;s popularity had faded badly, and the comic&#x27;s editors were giving serious consideration to dropping it. Instead, it was decided that the strip would be given a stay of execution, albeit under a new artist. Wayne Thompson took over from the following month. Thompson did another revamp of the strip, creating a version of Billy that was based on Malcolm Judge&#x27;s work (and to a lesser extent, David Parkins&#x27; design of Billy), and gave a new life to the character and feel of the strip. However, due to his commitments with Jak for the Dandy, the strip was understudied again by Trevor Metcalfe, who, aided with a Wacom tablet, drew the strip in a mixture of his own and Thompson&#x27;s style. Metcalfe later drew the strip full-time, gradually bringing the strip&#x27;s artwork more in line with his early 1990s work, until his sudden departure from the comic in 2007, after which the Beano started running re-prints of the strips drawn by David Parkins.

This run of reprints continued for the next year (including a few early Trevor Metcalfe and Vic Neill strips along the way) until the comic&#x27;s 70th anniversary issue, when Barrie Appleby returned to provide a new strip (this time drawn in his own style, as opposed to his 1980s work which followed Malcolm Judge&#x27;s style). The strip then reverted to being reprints for the following year, mostly of Vic Neill&#x27;s, with one Graeme Hall reprint in October 2009. At the end of that month a new permanent artist was appointed, namely Nick Brennan who had previously drawn Crazy for Daisy in The Beano, and Blinky in The Dandy.

In the Beano Annual 2008, Billy&#x27;s story was drawn by Tom Paterson, and in the 2009 annual Wayne Thompson drew it. Tom Paterson again drew Billy in the 2010 annual, while Nigel Parkinson drew his strip in the 2011 annual, in the style of Vic Neill.

In some issues of the comic in the autumn of 2011, Billy appeared as the first strip in the comic – this slot is usually reserved for Dennis the Menace and Gnasher.

In November 2012, Wilbur Dawbarn took over as artist, returning the strip to its original style and removing Billy&#x27;s tracksuit and bringing back the shorts and red T-shirt. In 2016, writing duties for the strip were taken over by Andy Fanton and Danny Pearson.

==Physical appearance==

When the strip began, Billy simply wore a T-shirt and black shorts. In a late 1970s strip, Billy&#x27;s dad sends him out to buy a new pair of trousers, supposedly to slow Billy down, but as he buys a pair of tracksuit bottoms this doesn&#x27;t happen, though from that point Billy wore those trousers, of which originally had vertical stripes running down the sides before they were removed after a few strips for unknown reasons. A more dynamic change came in the early 1990s when he began to wear a black tracksuit marked with a lightning bolt. When depicted in colour, originally all the non-black areas of the tracksuit were in yellow, though soon all but the lightning flash was in red, and later the lightning flash turned red itself. The tracksuit itself also had vertical stripes on the sides of his tracksuit bottoms similar to the ones he began wearing in 1976, as well as an additional lightning bolt symbol on the back of his jumper, although the latter feature only mainly appeared in the strips drawn by David Parkins. By the time the comic transitioned to full colour, both the stripes and extra bolt were removed entirely, again for unknown reasons. Billy initially wore ordinary shoes but around the same time as the tracksuit was introduced he started to wear trainers, which are usually worn out very quickly by whizzspeed running, and as a result often have holes in the soles.

From the first strip, Billy sported a shaved hair cut with two long, antennae-like hairs sticking out at the top. In the 1970 Beano Annual, it is revealed that the reason why Billy, plus Dad and Alfie, always have this style is because they always get thrown out of the barber&#x27;s before the last two hairs can be shaved off. After Vic Neill became artist, the two hairs morphed into a lightning flash, with no explanation given for this in the comic. This hairstyle was retained by Graeme Hall, but was later reverted to the original two hairs once Wayne Thompson took over. It has been revealed in some strips that Billy&#x27;s hair is blond should it grow to full length.

==Personality traits==

Billy is usually depicted as being rather less mischievous than the other Beano characters, and not going out of his way to harm or annoy others. Any trouble he causes is usually by accident, although this happens quite often due to Billy&#x27;s whizzspeed. However, he does seem to have a fairly short temper; in the 1999 Beano Book he exploded in a rage after finding out that Alfie had a glass of ice during a race. He has been shown to be rather impatient, unable to sit still even for a film. Much like other Beano characters save for Dennis the Menace and The Bash Street Kids, he does not appear to have a set group of friends. His kind nature and good heart is occasionally taken advantage of by other Beano characters, especially that of Roger the Dodger and Dennis the Menace, an example being one strip in which he agrees to carry Roger&#x27;s dodge books so he can slow down.

<doc id="547532" wikidata="Q12056846" url="?curid=547532" title="Great seal">
<text>A great seal is a seal used by a head of state, or someone authorised to do so on their behalf, to confirm formal documents, such as laws, treaties, appointments and letters of dispatch. It was and is used as a guarantee of the authenticity of the most important and solemn records and documents.

In the Middle Ages, the great seal played a far greater political role and there was much real power associated with having control over the seal. In addition to the great seal, a prince usually also had a privy seal, used for correspondence of a more private nature.

The seal is usually formally entrusted upon an office-holder to act as keeper of the seal. This keeper may be a separate office but was also usually combined with that of the chancellor. Nowadays, the great seal is usually entrusted upon a minister, particularly a minister of justice.

== Design ==
Great seals of republics usually show the nation&#x27;s coat of arms (e.g. the Great Seal of the United States) or an allegorical image (e.g. France). For this reason, the design used usually remains unchanged. The seals themselves may, however, be replaced because of wear depending on how often the seal is used. In monarchies, by contrast, the great seal is often changed some time after the accession of a new monarch as the seal often depicts the reigning monarch in full form.

<doc id="547533" wikidata="Q504635" url="?curid=547533" title="Crossover music">
<text>Crossover is a term applied to musical works or performers who appeal to different types of audiences. This can be seen, for example, when a song appears on two or more of the record charts, which track differing musical styles or genres.

In some contexts, the term &quot;crossover&quot; can have negative connotations associated with cultural appropriation, implying the dilution of a music&#x27;s distinctive qualities to appeal to mass tastes. For example, in the early years of rock and roll, many songs originally recorded by African-American musicians were re-recorded by white artists such as Pat Boone in a more toned-down style, often with changed lyrics, that lacked the hard edge of the original versions. These covers were popular with a much broader audience.

Crossover frequently results from the appearance of the music in a film soundtrack. For instance, Sacred Harp music experienced a spurt of crossover popularity as a result of its appearance in the 2003 film &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, and bluegrass music experienced a revival due to the reception of 2000&#x27;s &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;.

==Classical crossover==


Classical crossover broadly encompasses both classical music that has become popularized and a wide variety of popular music forms performed in a classical manner or by classical artists. It can also refer to collaborations between classical and popular performers, as well as music that blends elements of classical music (including operatic and symphonic) with popular music (including pop, rock, middle of the road, and Latin, among other types). Pop vocalists and musicians, opera singers, classical instrumentalists, and occasionally rock groups primarily perform classical crossover. Although the phenomenon has long been widespread in the music industry, record companies first used the term &quot;classical crossover&quot; in the 1980s. It has gained in popularity since the 1990s and has acquired its own &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

===Popular classics===
A means of generating vast popularity for the classics has been through their use as inspirational anthems in sports settings. The aria &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot; from Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot;, especially Luciano Pavarotti&#x27;s version, has become indissolubly linked with soccer.

===Classical performers===
Within the classical recording industry, the term &quot;crossover&quot; is applied particularly to classical artists&#x27; recordings of popular repertoire such as Broadway show tunes. Two examples of this are Lesley Garrett&#x27;s excursions into musical comedy and José Carreras&#x27;s recording &quot;West Side Story&quot;, as well as Teresa Stratas&#x27; recording &quot;Showboat&quot;. Soprano Eileen Farrell is generally considered to be one of the first classical singers to have a successful crossover recording with her 1960 album &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Right to Sing the Blues&quot;.

The first Three Tenors concert in 1990 was a landmark in which Luciano Pavarotti, José Carreras and Plácido Domingo brought a combination of opera, Neapolitan folksong, musical theatre and pop to a vast television audience. This laid the foundations for the modern flourishing of classical crossover.

Collaborations between classical and popular performers have included Sting and Edin Karamazov&#x27;s album &quot;Songs from the Labyrinth&quot;. A collaboration between Freddie Mercury and soprano Montserrat Caballé resulted in the worldwide hit &quot;Barcelona&quot;. R&amp;B singer Mariah Carey performed a live duet with her mother Patricia, who is an opera singer, of the Christmas song &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;. Welsh mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins performed a duet with rock singer Michael Bolton of O Holy Night. Singers and instrumentalists from the classical tradition, Andreas Dorschel has argued, run the risk of losing the sophistication of the genre(s) they were trained in, when they try to perform rock music, without coming up to the often rough and wild qualities of the latter.

Italian pop tenor Andrea Bocelli, who is the biggest-selling singer in the history of classical music, has been described as the king of classical crossover. British soprano Sarah Brightman is also considered a crossover classical artist, having released albums of classical, folk, pop and musical-theatre music. Brightman dislikes the classical crossover label, though she has said she understands the need to categorize music. In the 2008 Polish release of her &quot;Symphony&quot; album she sings &quot;I Will Be with You (Where the Lost Ones Go)&quot; with Polish tenor Andrzej Lampert, another artist who has performed in both classical and non-classical styles, as well as having actually obtained full musical training and academic degrees in both (though operatic singing is his main professional focus).

<text>Rifts is a multi-genre role-playing game created by Kevin Siembieda in August 1990 and published continuously by Palladium Books since then. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic future, deriving elements from cyberpunk, science fiction, fantasy, horror, western, mythology and many other genres.

&quot;Rifts&quot; serves as a cross-over environment for a variety of other Palladium games with different universes connected through &quot;rifts&quot; on Earth that lead to different spaces, times, and realities that Palladium calls the &quot;Rifts Megaverse&quot;. &quot;Rifts&quot; describes itself as an &quot;advanced&quot; role-playing game and not an introduction for those new to the concept.

Palladium continues to publish books for the &quot;Rifts&quot; series, with about 80 books published between 1990 and 2011. &quot;Rifts Ultimate Edition&quot; was released in August 2005 and designed to update the game with Palladium&#x27;s incremental changes to its system, changes in the game world, and additional information and character types. The web site is quick to point out that this is not a second edition but an improvement and expansion of the original role playing game.

==Background==
The RPG had the tentative title &quot;Boomers&quot;, named after the original name for the Glitter Boy power armor until Kevin Siembieda changed the name after finding out it was in use for &quot;Bubblegum Crisis&quot;.

== Setting ==

The foundations for the &quot;Rifts&quot; world were originally developed in the Palladium game &quot;Beyond the Supernatural&quot; (first released in 1987).

The &quot;Rifts&quot; world is Earth, but hundreds of years into the future. Ley lines, lines of magic energy, criss-cross the earth forming supernatural geographic areas such as the Bermuda Triangle. Points where Ley Lines intersect, called a nexus, are places of powerful magic, such as the Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge. If a Ley Line nexus energy surges or is purposely activated, the very fabric of space and time can be torn, creating a rift, or a hole in space-time leading to another place, time, or a new/parallel dimension. Ley Lines in most lower capacity &quot;realities&quot; have less Potential Psychic Energy or PPE to allow them to be visible, but in the magic or PPE saturated worlds like &quot;Rifts&quot; Earth, they become visible based on PPE intensity. Some are visible during the day as evident by a slight blue shift of the surrounding environment. Otherwise at night or from space the massive bands of blue-white energy can be as large as half a mile wide in some places, and stretching for many miles.

The Magic energy making up Ley lines as mentioned is Potential Psychic Energy or PPE. Found in various places, objects, and animals, one of the greatest sources of PPE is in young and prepubescent children. An adult&#x27;s level of PPE can vary based on other factors. PPE also allows Psionics which uses energy known as Inner Strength Points or ISP. Psychic phenomenon (more commonly called psioics) can also vary from individuals, ranging from none at all to Master level abilities. Psychic abilities can manifest in virtually any way imaginable. Some psychics develop differently, such as psi-stalkers; human mutants that feed on psychic energy.

=== Earth ===
&quot;Rifts&quot; begins with two future-historical premises: first, a golden age of humanity occurs, with tremendous advances in science, technology, military, and society. Humanity as a whole is at peace as a majority of Earth&#x27;s nations decide to cease world war and begin to share ideas and technology freely. Much of the solar system is conquered, humanity&#x27;s wars will end, and harmony will reign. Second, that this golden age is followed by an unknown cause near the winter solstice and a rare planetary alignment, causing a disaster that cascades into tremendous destruction via a ripple effect.

The cataclysm begins with unprecedented storms of all kinds, earthquakes and tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions including the Yellowstone Caldera.

What is already a huge release of mystical energy is multiplied as a result of several special conditions: a rare multi-planetary alignment, occurrence during the Winter Solstice, and all at midnight. The deaths of millions at this time amplifies these already high psychic energies, triggering many powerful natural disasters across the world, including the return of Atlantis.

The energy release from the deaths of millions more in turn releases even more mystic energy, causing more disasters in a vicious cycle. Ultimately, the total destruction brings an unprecedented energy release of billions. Ley Line networks that crisscross the globe are energized as never before, causing rifts to open both on Earth and throughout the Megaverse. Untold numbers of alien beings are pulled from their own home worlds, while Great Powers of the Megaverse are alerted of a new and valuable planet to conquer.

For hundreds of years after the holocaust, many creatures, both mythical beasts and alien beings, come through the Rifts – some of them now permanently opened – to wreak additional havoc. The old world gone, a new Dark Age dawns and humanity&#x27;s shrinking population is reduced, due to catastrophe and domestic failure, immeasurably. This period is covered in Palladium&#x27;s &quot;Rifts Chaos Earth&quot; spin-off series.

&quot;Rifts&quot; initially takes place in 101 P.A. (equivalent to the year 2387) 289 years after this event. The &quot;Post-Apocalypse&quot; calendar was established by the formation of the Coalition States in 2286.

While many different events that make up the world begin before and after this time, such as with the invasion of Chi-Town by the Federation of Magic (before) or as the Four Horsemen appear in Africa (after), this time frame is the setting for most &quot;World Books&quot; that describe a kind of snapshot in this phase (103-109 P.A). In the latest World Books, the current date is around 110 P.A. (2396).

By this time, most of the disasters have quieted down, though Earth is still bathed in the released PPE. The planet&#x27;s mystical energy has added untold numbers of alien beings from other dimensions, who continue to arrive through the Rifts both accidentally and deliberately. The humanoid creatures that arrive on earth are referred to as Dimensional Beings (called D-Bees). Some are familiar fantasy races, such as elves and dwarfs, while others have never been seen before (created specifically for the game setting). Non-humanoid creatures have also arrived, including monstrous creatures and mystical demons with hides as strong as tank armor. The most powerful (and a common theme in the Palladium Megaverse) are the Lovecraftian Alien Intelligences, living mountains of flesh with lidless eyes, wriggling tentacles, and great supernatural powers. In some rare cases, even the ancient gods of mythology have returned to reclaim their former lands.

To cope with these natural, supernatural, and alien menaces, the human race has adapted in a variety of ways, many of them borrowed from the technological developments of the lost Golden Age. Powered armor suits and giant robot vehicles are frequently used to combat the dangers of &quot;Rifts&quot;, but more invasive augmentation is common. This has three basic categories: &quot;Juicers&quot; do it chemically, the &quot;Borgs&quot; do it mechanically, and &quot;Crazies&quot; make use of performance-enhancing brain implants. All such augmentations boost strength, speed, endurance, and dexterity to superhuman levels. However, all come at great cost. Chemicals cause the body to wear out faster, decreasing life span to a few years. Mechanical Borg augmentation causes a loss of humanity when those with multiple limb and organ replacements become more machine than human. Brain implants cause mental instability ranging from mild phobias to crippling neurosis or psychosis.

Dangerous augmentations are often necessary dangers for humans in order to keep pace with the world around them, and those that choose augmentation accept these risks for the power they bring. Still others are required to receive augmentations either for self-defense, work, or even against their will as the minimalistic, needy, and weak are forced or coerced to serve. Some aren&#x27;t aware of the dangers, and accept the augmentation blind to the side-effects.

Some turn to other means to become &quot;more&quot; than human. As magic abounds on &quot;Rifts&quot; Earth, many people turn to the magical arts. Others form pacts with alien intelligences or deities in exchange for great magical knowledge, risking becoming a pawn of the beings they dared turn to for power. Still others discover that they have great natural psionic potential, and dedicate their lives to discovering the abilities of their own minds.

The Ley Lines, formerly invisible, now dominate the landscape, appearing as massive lines of bluish energy half a mile wide, some twice that tall, stretching thousands of miles, crisscrossing the globe. The largest can even be seen from space.

==== North America ====
The strongest power in North America is the Coalition States (CS). The governing body of the Coalition States is based in the arcological city of Chi-Town and lays claim to northern Illinois (the southern part being controlled by the &quot;Federation of Magic&quot;) and all of Iowa. Other member states consist of &quot;Lone Star&quot;, formed from the Texas Panhandle, who specialize in mutating animals into talking servants considered by many players as cannon fodder but is one of their primary weapons against the supernatural as without them they would have to rely solely on human psychics; Missouri; and Iron Heart which consists of the eastern half of Ontario, Canada. The Coalition States are most often described as technologically advanced fascist human supremacists with a totalitarian government, restrictive internal media, restrictive education (such as enforced illiteracy), and a massive military. The Coalition is ruled by Emperor Karl Prosek, and is genocidally opposed to all aliens, D-bees (Dimensional Beings, to include humans from other times and even unlucky CS troops that have traveled through a Rift and survived to return... only to be &quot;contained&quot; by his former comrades), human mutations, and Magic. His ultimate goal is to control the Earth by humans and for humans, and do so by attacking anything and everyone that is foreign to Earth as it was before the cataclysm. Nevertheless, Prosek allows some of the less threatening non-humans to live alongside lesser-privileged humans in the burbs surrounding Chi-Town. Most of these poor souls think that they may eventually gain citizenship so they can live within the protective walls of the arcology.

The second greatest power is &quot;Free Quebec&quot;. At one time it was a Coalition State, but constant disagreement with Chi-Town over issues like Glitter Boy production, education level of the populace, and use of mutant animals, led to secession and eventually a short civil war. A cease-fire was signed (mainly due to the CS&#x27;s bigger problem with Tolkeen), but distrust has remained.

Mexico is ruled by a group of vampire kingdoms, who treat humans as little more than cattle to feed upon. North of the Rio Grande, west of Texas and roaming most of the American Southwest are large nomadic bands/tribes of bandits who collectively form the &quot;Pecos Empire&quot; which incorporates the cities of El Paso, Los Alamos (formerly Austin) and &quot;Houstown&quot;, its unofficial capital. Though the nation is not part of a cohesive power structure or political organization, &quot;Emperor Sabre Laser&quot; is attempting to unite the city-states under his banner. Much of the western United States has more or less willingly reverted to a mix of modern and past technology, and the days of the Wild West, where outlaws ride hovercycles into battle, cowboys are as likely to raise dinosaurs as they are cattle, cyborgs prospect for gold and other minerals, and wild buffalo, sent to another dimension to prevent their extinction, have returned to the plains in the millions. American Natives have divided into two groups. The Traditionalists, who were also taken by the spirit people and returned to Earth along with the Bison, refuse to use most items of technology, preferring the old ways. Then there is the modern camp, who have designed many technological marvels of their own. The pockets of civilization include the &quot;Colorado Baronies&quot;, Hope, Testament, Wilmington, and Charity, a collective of small and a few large towns, founded by the survivors of the Denver area. In Arizona, the &quot;Clarkdale Confederacy&quot; (Clarkdale, Jerome, and Cottonwood), has managed to survive even as Flagstaff, Prescott and Phoenix have collapsed around them; there is also the town founded and run by mercenaries known as &quot;Arzno&quot;.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police managed to survive the great cataclysm, though Canada itself did not. The Mounties have become an independent law enforcement force called the Tundra Rangers, patrolling the northern wilderness.

The Midwest, both upper and central, is home to most of North America&#x27;s population. The Manistique Imperium and Northern Gun in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, both Coalition allies, are among the biggest weapons manufacturing areas on the continent. &quot;New Lazlo&quot; is one of the largest cities in Michigan&#x27;s southern portion. Chillicothe in Missouri is a large supplier of Coalition food processing and growing. However, Missouri&#x27;s southern half, home to the city-states of &quot;Whykin&quot; (Poplar Bluff) and &quot;Kingsdale&quot; (West Plains) are in constant opposition to the CS and claim independence. North Dakota is home to the Wilk&#x27;s firearms corporation, though not much else. Arkansas is home to the independent CS ally &quot;El Dorado&quot;. Southern Illinois and the Ohio Valley is home to the &quot;Federation of Magic&quot;. Also in the Ohio Valley is &quot;Psyscape&quot;: a city-state founded by Psychics.

&quot;Tolkeen&quot; was a major city in the former Minneapolis region in early &quot;Rifts&quot; books; the city welcomed users of magic. A military campaign made by the Coalition States (which is the primary event of 109 PA) resulted in the magic-user kingdom being wiped off the map (this is covered in the highly debated six-volume series of source/storybooks &quot;Coalition Wars: Siege on Tolkeen&quot;).

In the Northeast, the city-state of &quot;Lazlo&quot;, named after the great 20th century supernatural researcher and writer Victor Lazlo (from another Palladium RPG, &quot;Beyond The Supernatural&quot;), was built upon the ruins of the Canadian city of Toronto. This major center of civilization is well known as a melting pot of humans, D-Bees and other, stranger beings, and is the home of Techno-Wizardry. &quot;Mad Haven&quot; is the name given to the ruins of Manhattan Island, although tectonic forces during the cataclysm have moved it into the coast creating a peninsula. It is seen by most denizens of Rifts Earth as a refuge of demons and madness.

==== South America ====
The return of Atlantis has caused the Amazon River basin to flood most of the western part of South America, giving it the nickname &quot;The Land of a Thousand Islands&quot;. In Colombia, a nation of humans and Dwarves fight against a kingdom of Vampires. The gods of the Inca have returned to their ancient holdings in the Andes, and fight a battle against alien invaders known as the &quot;Arkons&quot;. Coming together as one, the &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; has created a wide range of technology and magic, including &quot;Nazca Line Magic&quot;, exclusive to the Empire. The Empire incorporates the cities of Cuzco, Nazca, Arequipa and Lima. Much of the rest of the continent is a wide collection of states ranging from democracies, corrupt oligarchies, and communist guerrillas known as Shining Path, to Mutants, Amazons, Aliens, Transdimensional Mercenaries, pre-historic creatures and dozens of others.

In what was once Argentina, the &quot;Silver River Republics&quot; of Cordoba (the &quot;South American Chi-Town&quot;), Santiago (one of the most tolerant Human nations on Rifts Earth), Achilles (a nation founded by Mutants), and New Babylon, a nation where Humans and a race of Aliens live side by side) have thrived and created nations whose strength rivals that of the CS.

In what was once Bolivia freed Human and D-Bees slave soldiers, of the race called &quot;Dakir&quot;, have formed the &quot;Megaversal Legion&quot;: a mercenary company with one of the highest levels of technology on Rifts Earth (possibly even the Megaverse). Their Inertia Beam weapons are truly one of a kind, allowing them to keep the edge over all opponents they face.

==== Europe ====
* England has become a vast wilderness again, broken up by the occasional giant &quot;Millennium Tree&quot; or feudal kingdom, complete with a New Camelot and a new King Arthur, partially being manipulated by the ethereal extension of an alien intelligence (disguised as the wizard Merlin). Also the magic of Druids and Faeries has become commonplace.
* In Germany, the New German Republic, with assistance from the Triax corporation, battles against an empire of Gargoyles that has apparently conquered much of Europe.
* France has already been overrun by Gargoyle hordes and other monsters and cults. New Camelot, the NGR, and the Gargoyle Empire are all making moves into the territory as well.
* Russia is ruled by a collection of Warlords, who rule through the use of vast armies and Cyborg troops. The only major civilized nation is the &quot;Sovietski&quot;, all that truly remain of the pre-Rifts Russian Empire and a trade partner of the NGR, who, like them, are in constant battle with the Gargoyle and Brodkil Empires.

==== Asia ====
Much of China has been overrun by demons. The remnants of the People&#x27;s Republic of China live in the pre-Rifts subterranean city Geofront, possessing pre-rifts technology equal or exceeding any other human nation on Rifts Earth, fighting to free their nation from the grip of the Yama Kings.

Japan has become a mixture of tradition and technology. The Samurai and warrior monks of the New Empire battle Oni demons and high-tech raiders from the Otomo Shogunate. Despite their ardent anti-technology sentiments, one of the New Empire&#x27;s closest allies is the Republic of Japan, an alliance centered on three pre-Rifts cities (Hiroshima, Iwakuni, and Kure) accidentally rifted off the planet at the exact moment of the Great Cataclysm, and sent hundreds of years into their future. The rest of the archipelago (which now has the pre-Rifts main island of Honshū divided into two islands from the risen sea levels) is dominated by smaller breakaway governments; a significant portion of the northern half of Japan is dominated by Oni and other denizens from Rifts called the &quot;Zone&quot;.

Korea - both North and South - has been completely overrun by demons with nothing remaining of the pre-Rifts nations.

==== Africa ====
Much of Africa has gone back to nature, making the land a wild, mysterious Dark Continent again, where only those foolhardy enough to ignore the cautionary tales would willingly go.

In Egypt, the ley lines coursing through the pyramids have brought Rama-Set, an evil oriental-type Dragon who has conquered the locals and established the Phoenix Empire (with Rama-Set, in human form, leading it as Pharaoh).

Meanwhile, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (the powerful supernatural beings legends named War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death) are traveling across the continent, seeking to reunite and combine their powers into an ultimate destroyer of a monster; but a group of powerful adventurers is hot on their tails, including the legendary rogue scholar Erin Tarn (marked for death by the Coalition States for her writings, which criticize the Coalition States), and the 20th century&#x27;s most accomplished time-displaced expert on the paranormal, Victor Lazlo (whose writings were so popular among P.A. magic-users that they named a kingdom after him), and even the disguised (and unfortunately amnesiac) Egyptian Goddess Isis. (See Rifts: World Book 4: Africa)

==== Atlantis ====
The lost continent of Atlantis appeared after the cataclysm that caused the rifts. According to some it rose from the sea, but more accurately it returned from an alternate dimension to which it had shifted to ages ago.

Now controlled by the Splugorth, a race of Supernatural Intelligences, Atlantis is a land ruled by magic and monsters. An inter-dimensional marketplace where any number of creatures, including humans, are bought and sold as slaves, and often serve as fodder in gladiatorial arenas. Enhanced by parasites or other magic, they are then pitted against one another or bizarre, monstrous creatures.

The Splugorth are evil, trans-dimensional conquerors that are reminiscent of supernatural entities described in the works of H. P. Lovecraft. They are huge, tentacled monstrosities with a giant eye atop their massive, amorphous bodies. The Splugorth rule through the use of subject races enslaved by Bio-Wizardry, a form of mysticism that involves the use of parasites and symbiotes to enhance one&#x27;s abilities. The Splugorth are also masters of Rune Magic (such as the creation of the fabled &quot;rune weapons&quot;), an offshoot of Bio-Wizardry. They are an evil power that spans many dimensions and are the sworn enemies of the True Atlanteans who have been banished from Atlantis. The Splugorth minions are a particular threat on the coast lines of adjacent North and South America, conducting slave raids against human and D-Bee settlements to feed the insatiable hunger of the Atlantean slave markets, and in some cases, the hunger (often literal) of Atlantis&#x27; extradimensional visitors.

==== Australia ====
A vast inland sea has flooded the centre of the continent leaving notable landmarks like Uluru completely submerged. With the return of magic to the land, the Aborigines have enjoyed resurgence and many practice Dreamtime magic. The &quot;civilized&quot; world has devolved into often competing city-states, with Melbourne and Perth the most technologically advanced. In the &quot;Northland&quot; exist the races known as the Mokoloi and Shadow People.

==== The Oceans ====
Deep within the Mariana Trench, a massive, evil Alien Intelligence known as the Lord of the Deep (sometimes mistakenly believed by survivors of its rampages on Rifts Earth to be the Kraken or Leviathan) slowly grows ever larger in size and may someday try to devour every living thing on the planet. It is opposed by the &quot;Whale Singers&quot;, rebellious creations of the monster, and the descendants of the United States Navy, now called the &quot;New Navy&quot;. Other forces above and below the waves include a floating city known as Tritonia, pirates including the ruthless aliens known as the &quot;Horune&quot;, monsters, dolphins/orca/whales, and extradimensional invaders.

=== Other settings ===
Further supplements to the &quot;Rifts&quot; game have expanded the setting to include:

*&quot;Mutants in Orbit&quot; - Several Space Stations and Colonies existed in orbit at the time of the Great Cataclysm. The descendants of their inhabitants, including many Moreau-style mutant animals, still survive in space, fighting against each other, and trying to prevent any force from entering or leaving Earth. (For use with &quot;Rifts&quot; &amp; &quot;After The Bomb&quot;.)
*&quot;The Three Galaxies&quot; - an alternative space opera setting of a series of galaxies centered on the planet and dimensional nexus of &quot;Phase World&quot;. Several explorers, cults, and interstellar and intergalactic states are involved in the search for the &quot;Cosmic Forge&quot;, a powerful artifact that is said to have created the universe.
*&quot;Skraypers&quot; - Superheroes lead a resistance movement against alien conquerors amongst the massive cities of their home planet. Like Mutants in Orbit, Skraypers is designed for both Rifts (where it is set in the Three Galaxies), and another Palladium game, in this case, Heroes Unlimited.
*&quot;Wormwood&quot; - Knights and symbiote-bearing warriors fight against demons on a living planet.
*&quot;Rifts Chaos Earth&quot; - Earth as it was during and immediately after the devastation of the Apocalypse. (It was supposed to be an alternate Earth where the governments and civilizations of the Golden Age were able to stay intact all because the first nuke strike was one minute after midnight.)
*&quot;Manhunter Universe&quot; - an alternative dimension to Rifts:Earth, published as a sourcebook under license from Palladium Books by Myrmidon Press. In this dimension, humankind fights an intense battle against artificially intelligent robots bent on human extermination.
Additionally any other Palladium RPG can become the setting for a Rifts style campaign.
*&quot;ALL Palladium Books&quot; - though the above sourcebooks are more specifically related to Rifts all of Palladium&#x27;s games are considered to be within the same &quot;megaverse&quot; and so all of their other games can be used as source books. Though the canon incarnation of &quot;Chaos Earth&quot; is Rifts&#x27; past it is also commonly accepted that Beyond the Supernatural is the distant past (due to the presence of the same mystic energy AND use of Lazlo&#x27;s name) which may or may not include Ninjas and Superspies, Heroes Unlimited, After the Bomb (or if you have the books Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), System Failure, Dead Reign and even Nightspawn/bane or Robotech or Macross II. But Palladium Fantasy RPG or Recon happen in entirely different dimensions so could be source books but not Rifts&#x27; past. While Splycers on the other hand is intentionally a big mystery it may or may not be an alternate reality or a completely different dimension so as Kevin likes to point out so often, it is all up to the GM.
*&quot;Anything&quot; - if you like the system but you have an old favorite character, convert it. Conversions are encouraged but due to copyright issues Kevin doesn&#x27;t want any conversions that have a basis copyrighted by someone else posted on the Palladium Forums.

=== Weapons and technology ===
Despite the near-total collapse of human civilization, most of the powerful technology managed to survive the centuries. There are many reasons given for the survival or rapid development of the high technology. In The New German Republic/Triax Industries the infrastructure survived. In the case of the Coalition States it is suggested that their benefactor is a rogue artificial intelligent computer named ARCHIE 3. In Japan the main technology base is a part of the country that was &quot;rifted&quot; from Earth&#x27;s past. The technology, regardless of the unlikelihood of the varied factions obtaining it, is in fact instrumental to the continued survival of mankind in a world where many creatures now can survive being struck by the main gun of a battle tank.

The most prolific weapons on &quot;Rifts&quot; Earth, in nearly all regions, are energy weapons. The most common are lasers, ion beams, plasma cannons, and particle beams. Also popular are rail guns, and miniaturized rockets inappropriately called &quot;Mini-Missiles,&quot; as they have no guidance system. Due to the proliferation of supernatural monsters such as vampires, silver-plated melee weapons and silver-plated bullets have also risen in popularity. For more conventional opponents, vibro-blades (knives, swords, and other edged weapons whose edges vibrate very rapidly to increase cutting power) are the weapon of choice for hand-to-hand combat.

Rail guns are highly advanced in &quot;Rifts&quot;, and are used in a way similar to machine guns in modern times. However, the weapon, ammunition belts/drums/clips, and energy packs to power the weapon make most rail guns very heavy, and are usually restricted to Powered Armor, &#x27;Borgs, and vehicles. One of the most famous rail guns on &quot;Rifts&quot; Earth is the RG13 Rapid Acceleration Electro-Magnetic Rail Gun known as the &quot;Boom Gun&quot; used famously by the USA-G10 Glitter Boy power armor. It is a weapon so powerful that it creates an immensely deafening sonic boom whenever it is fired that shatters glass for hundreds of yards around.

Ion weapons are also popular, presumably because they do provide sound and recoil unlike lasers.

Heavy weapons are generally Plasma or Particle-beam weapons, which have great stopping power, but also generally have a short range.

Alongside hover vehicles and Powered Armor, a common vehicle used in battle in &quot;Rifts&quot; Earth is the Giant Robot. In addition to their role as war machines, Giant Robots are also intimidating, and turned out to be good in combating very large supernatural creatures (such as dragons, demons, and giants).

An increasingly popular use of technology is Techno-Wizardry, which is a fusion of magic and technology. The aims of Techno-Wizardry are to use magic not only to power technology, but to make it more effective than it was prior to magic infusion. Techno-Wizardry also encompasses the creation of more traditional magic weapons, so a Techno-Wizard can make both a flaming sword or a plasma cannon, often with many of the same components and spells.

The ultimate in magic are Rune Weapons, indestructible, extremely powerful weapons with the life-force of an intelligent being driving them. Rune weapons are capable of communicating with their wielders, animating and fighting by themselves, casting magic, and may harm potential users if they don&#x27;t like their motives and personality (based on the RPG tradition of assigning an &quot;alignment&quot; to a character of good, selfish or evil), and can bind themselves psychically to those they do. Some of the strongest Rune Weapons, reminiscent of Michael Moorcock&#x27;s fictional sword Stormbringer, are &quot;Soul Drinkers&quot;, capable of tearing the soul out of their victims, irrevocably killing them with only the slightest scratch.

== System ==

=== Character classes ===
While the game books rapidly expanded the number of character classes to a large number, the original game book contained four overall character groups with approximately 4 to 5 character classes per group.
# Men of Arms are the combat specialists of the game. They include cyborgs, freelance warriors called Headhunters, the Coalition Army, the Glitterboy powered armor pilot (the Glitterboy named for its laser proof chrome alloy armor), the Cyber-Knight psychic warrior, the drug enhanced Juicer who will die in a few years as a side effect, and the Crazy who has microchips installed into their brains to force higher performance and psychic abilities at the expense of their sanity.
# Scholars and Adventurers. These are the wilderness scout, the rogue scientist, the rogue scholar, the Cyber-doctor, the Operator (a mechanic second to none), City-Rat street punk and computer hacker, and even a vagabond who has minimal gear and skills.
# Racial Character Classes. These are not trades or skills you learn, but a group of classes that were born with their powers. They include hatchling dragons, the Dog-Boy from the Coalition which is a mutated dog that walks upright, talks, and can psychically detect the supernatural, the Psi-Stalker which is more powerful than a Dog-Boy, but must also feed on mystic energy which a Dog-Boy does not, the Burster with psychic powers over fire, and the Mind Melter with large amounts of psychic power.
# Men of Magic. These are the Ley Line Walker with special abilities when on Ley Lines and normal magic spell casting, the Shifter who is taught their magic by an external supernatural creature and specialize in travel magic, the Mystic who is instinctive and self-taught and half psychic, the Techno-Wizard who can install magical properties into technological devices

=== Damage and firepower ===
One important note about &quot;Rifts&quot; versus other game systems is scale: weaponry and combat in &quot;Rifts&quot; are generally far more destructive than in other gaming systems. For example, in &quot;Rifts&quot; and other Palladium games, a simple knife inflicts between 1 and 4 &quot;points&quot; of damage. This point system makes sense when considering a small animal killed has between 1 and 4 &quot;hit points,&quot; which make it realistic that it could be killed by a single strike. Yet even a basic &quot;Rifts&quot;-era laser pistol will cause between 100 and 400 points of damage (more than enough to totally destroy a small car in one shot). This means someone shot by such a laser pistol would be literally cut in half without protective armor and trees, bystanders, or anything else in the line of fire would meet a similar fate. Thus, an average player character in &quot;Rifts&quot; Earth with standard-issue armor and weapons has the effective durability and firepower of a modern tank. Even minimal skirmishes may leave deep craters or even level towns from collateral damage.

To accommodate this scale, Mega Damage Capacity or MDC is an important game concept. Each point of mega-damage is equal to 100 points of &quot;Structural Damage&quot; or SDC. Armor and vehicles of this power level have protection of equivalent levels. For example, most personal body armor in the Rifts setting has on average 40 to 80 MDC, comparable to a modern-day tank, and &quot;Rifts&quot; armored vehicles start around 100-200 MDC and go up from there. Exceedingly powerful beings such as Dragons, gods and alien intelligences have mega-damage bodies caused by the high levels of magic energy present in this game setting, and their MDC can soar into the thousands, if not tens of thousands.

As &quot;Rifts&quot; has no systematic method of designing weaponry, the game is criticized frequently for severe power escalation; often magic, equipment, and character classes from new books are more potent than those from an earlier one (sometimes even with the same character class), with the result of many thinking they are thus required to buy the most recent supplement to keep up with the power curve (This is parodied in an 8-bit Theater episode fittingly titled &quot;Glitter Boy&quot;). &quot;Rifts Conversion Books&quot; are designed to help facilitate the transition of magic and psychic characters and creatures from other Palladium game lines into this new landscape, for which many automatically gain increased benefits due to the magic-rich environment. But a pistol or rifle that fires projectiles in our time fires the same bullets with the same effects during &quot;Rifts&quot; times and is effectively useless in most combat situations. It does retain certain value as an antique, and from a survival standpoint can be desirable as a hunting weapon.

=== Skills ===
&quot;Rifts&quot;, like other Palladium games, use percentile dice to calculate skill success. Each character, based on training, intelligence, and experience level, has a base percentage chance of success. If a number equal to or below a player&#x27;s percentage is rolled on percentile dice, then the use of the skill is considered to be a success. While modifiers are suggested in cases of unusual difficulty or proficiency, these are rare in the system, usually reserved for special skills. Some criticize this as being more cumbersome than the D&amp;D D20 System while Palladium defends their method as allowing for a wider variety of skills.

However, Combat is determined through the use of 20 sided dice. In its most basic form the combat system is an opposed roll of two dice, with additions and subtractions for character skills and environmental factors. One character will generally be offensive, the other defensive, and the highest dice roll will determine if the defender is struck by the offensive character&#x27;s attack.

== Spinoffs and alternate editions ==
Several novels, a MUD, several mush/muxs and large amounts of fan fiction have been based on the world of &quot;Rifts&quot;. A licensed &quot;Rifts&quot; video game (&quot;&quot;), was released in November 2005 for the Nokia N-Gage.

Siembieda has stated that he would like to see &quot;Rifts&quot; games developed for other consoles. However, he has stated that the niche nature of the role-playing game industry means it is hard to attract prospective developers to the property.

===RIFTS Collectible Card Game===
RIFTS Collectible Card Game is an out-of-print collectible card game released in September 2001 and was also one of the last games made by Precedence. It was based on the role-playing game. Precedence spent more time developing this game than any other. The core set had 286 cards with an additional 38 fixed cards released in a starter box format designed to sit on a bookshelf next to the RPG. The fixed cards had different stats than the booster pack versions. Two additional promo cards were also available and their names were homages to Diamond Comic Distributors and Gilbert Gottfried. The game is set 300 years in the future where dimensional anomalies called &quot;rifts&quot; have beset the world and through which aliens, demons, gods, and magical forces invade Earth. Each player adopts the role of a post-holocaust nation such as CyberWorks or the Tolkeen. The game is played so that the first person to run out of cards, loses the game.

The game included artwork by Mark Evans, among others, that creator Kevin Siembieda&#x27;s had a desire to reprint in an art book. It featured characters such as Fury Iron Juggernaut, General Ross Underhill, and King Victor Macklin. Eventually, the artwork was republished in the &quot;RIFTS Ultimate Edition RPG&quot; book. The book reproduced approximately 75 images from the CCG.

According to author Jane Frank, players thought the game artwork and game detail were excellent.

The Breaking Dads podcast reviewed the game and noted the company was hosting organized play events and gave retail support, when publisher support for the game immediately ceased as the company went out of business. They also remarked you couldn&#x27;t play the full game with the starter packs alone but rather a &quot;dumbed down&quot; version of the game. Essentially, the game suffered from lack of expansions and felt &quot;too basic&quot;, though they did mention the designer in an archived listserv addressed cards like &quot;Counter Attack&quot;, Event cards, as well as, adding new factions in future expansions.

===Savage Rifts===
In 2015 Pinnacle Entertainment Group announced a series of supplements converting &quot;Rifts&quot; to the Savage Worlds system. April 2016 Pinnacle announced a 2-month Kickstarter. By November 2016 they had dubbed this project Savage Rifts.

Titles released in the series include:

#Tome of Destiny

==Reception==
In Issue 48 of &quot;Challenge&quot;, Lester W. Smith found the information about rifts and the new Earth gave both players and referees a good base of knowledge. He especially liked the section on magic, saying, &quot;The magic system, when taken as a whole, is clear, concise and logical, explaining magic in general in a new and &#x27;realistic&#x27; light.&quot; However, he didn&#x27;t like the lack of an introductory adventure, commenting, &quot;For a game that is meant to stand alone, it’s surprising that no introductory scenario was included. Nor were any character sheets, handouts or pull-outs provided to aid the players.&quot; Smith had thought that the completely new rules system would clear up some of the long-standing problems with old Palladium rule systems. However, Smith found that &quot;Instead of clearing up old discrepancies, &quot;Rifts&quot; creates many of its own.&quot; He also found the rules badly organized. Despite these issues, Smith concluded, &quot;I highly recommend &quot;Rifts&quot; because of its setting and potential for great scenarios. [...] There is enough here to keep any GM busy thinking up new scenarios and creating new archvillains for players for quite a while.&quot;

Josh Timbrook reviewed &quot;Rifts&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #26 (April/May, 1991), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Overall, &quot;Rifts&quot; is an incredible roleplaying experience, and its setting seems to be as original and fun to play as the recent multi-genre games, &quot;Shadowrun&quot; and &quot;Torg&quot;. Those who are into bleak worlds, hi-tech magic, twisted rituals, fascist empires, brutal weaponry, mind-boggling power armor, and fantastic stories should really give it a try.&quot;

In Issue 13 of &quot;Arcane&quot; (December 1996), Lucya Sachnowski was disappointed in the &quot;Rifts World Book 11: Coalition War Campaign&quot;, saying that &quot;There are just five pages of short adventure ideas which are usable and versatile - providing a good mixture of combat and moral dilemmas - but they aren&#x27;t enough.&quot; She gave the book a below-average rating of 6 out of 10.

In a readers&#x27; poll conducted by the UK magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; in 1996 to determine the 50 most popular role-playing games of all time, &quot;Rifts&quot; was ranked 22nd. The magazine editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;It&#x27;s the ultimate in old-style high-energy RPGs. It uses a class-and-level system, and its supplements are full of new character classes, as well as weapons, robots and power armour. Fantasy-style creatures are a bit less common, and tend to be rather conventional elves and orcs - although it&#x27;s perfectly possible to play a baby dragon. One of the key concepts is &#x27;mega-damage&#x27;, which is important when you&#x27;re playing with giant robots and such. This is the game for people who want to have everything possible in their campaigns - and then to blow a lot of it up with cool super-weapons.&quot;

Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2013 rated &quot;Rifts&quot; as #9 in the top ten role-playing games of all time, saying &quot;Think about how many gaming groups have fallen apart, how many campaigns have turned to dust, all because people got tired of the same old story. &quot;Rifts&quot; changes all that, because one week your characters could be fighting aliens in giant mecha and the next they could be raiding a dragon&#x27;s hoard with Vikings. Not bad, Mr. Siembieda, not bad at all...&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;&quot;Rifts&quot; is the RPG born out of dumping all of the toys out into the middle of the room and them fight — G.I. Joes in TIE fighters, He-Man fighting M.A.S.K., the rubber great white shark inexplicably flying through the air to hunt ThunderCats. The game aims to answer every variation of the comic book store question, &#x27;Who would win?&#x27;&quot;

One dollar ($1) is normally divided into subsidiary currency of 100 cents, so a half dollar is equal to 50 cents. These half dollars (aka 50 cent pieces) are denominated as either Coins or as banknotes. Although more than a dozen countries have their own unique dollar currency, not all of them use a 50 cent piece or half dollar.

<doc id="547555" wikidata="Q1356390" url="?curid=547555" title="William Graham Sumner">
<text>William Graham Sumner (October 30, 1840 – April 12, 1910) was an American clergyman, social scientist, and neoclassical liberal. He taught social sciences at Yale University, where he held the nation&#x27;s first professorship in sociology and became one of the most influential teachers at any major school.

Sumner wrote extensively on the social sciences, penning numerous books and essays on ethics, American history, economic history, political theory, sociology, and anthropology. He supported &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics, free markets, and the gold standard, in addition to coining the term &quot;ethnocentrism&quot; to identify the roots of imperialism, which he strongly opposed. As a spokesman against elitism, he was in favor of the &quot;forgotten man&quot; of the middle class—a term he coined. He had a prolonged influence on American conservatism.

==Biography==
Sumner wrote an autobiographical sketch for the fourth of the histories of the Class of 1863 Yale College. In 1925, the Rev. Harris E. Starr, class of 1910 Yale Department of Theology, published the first full-length biography of Sumner. A second full-length biography by Bruce Curtis was published in 1981.

===Early life and education===
Sumner was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on October 30, 1840. His father, Thomas Sumner, was born in England and immigrated to the United States in 1836. His mother, Sarah Graham, was also born in England. She was brought to the United States in 1825 by her parents. Sumner&#x27;s mother died when he was eight.

In 1841, Sumner&#x27;s father went prospecting as far west as Ohio, but came back east to New England and settled in Hartford, Connecticut, in about 1845. Sumner wrote about his high regard for his father: &quot;His principles and habits of life were the best possible.&quot; Earlier in his life, Sumner said, he accepted from others &quot;views and opinions&quot; different from his father&#x27;s. However, &quot;at the present time,&quot; Sumner wrote, &quot;in regard to those matters, I hold with him and not with the others.&quot; Sumner did not name the &quot;matters.&quot;

Sumner was educated in the Hartford public schools. After graduation, he worked for two years as a clerk in a store before going to Yale College, graduating in 1863. Sumner achieved an impressive record at Yale as a scholar and orator. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa society in his junior year and in his senior year to the secretive Skull and Bones society.

Sumner avoided being drafted to fight in the American Civil War by paying a &quot;substitute&quot; $250, given to him by a friend, to enlist for three years. This and money given to him by his father and friends allowed Sumner to go to Europe for further studies. He spent his first year in the University of Geneva studying Latin and Hebrew and the following two years in the University of Göttingen studying ancient languages, history and Biblical science. All told, in his formal education Sumner learned Hebrew, Greek, Latin, French, and German. In addition, after middle age he taught himself Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Polish, Danish, and Swedish.

In May 1866, he went to Oxford University to study theology. At Oxford, Henry Thomas Buckle planted the sociology seed in Sumner&#x27;s mind. However, Herbert Spencer was to have the &quot;dominating influence upon Sumner&#x27;s thought.&quot;

===Tutor, clergyman and professor===
Except for a stint as a clergyman, Sumner&#x27;s whole career was spent at Yale.

While at Oxford, Sumner was elected a tutor in mathematics. He was made a lecturer in Greek at Yale, beginning in September 1867.

On December 27, 1867, at Trinity Church, New Haven, Sumner was ordained a deacon in the Episcopal Church. In March 1869, Sumner resigned his Yale tutorship to become assistant to the rector of Calvary Episcopal Church (Manhattan). In July 1869, Sumner was ordained as a priest.

From September 1870 to September 1872, Sumner was rector of the Church of the Redeemer in Morristown, New Jersey. On April 17, 1871, he married Jeannie Whittemore Elliott, daughter of Henry H. Elliott of New York City. They had three boys: one died in infancy, Eliot (Yale 1896) became an officer of the Pennsylvania Railroad; Graham (Yale 1897) became a lawyer in New York City.

Robert Bierstedt writes that Sumner preached two sermons every Sunday at the Church of the Redeemer. They &quot;stressed without surcease the Puritan virtues of hard work, self-reliance, self-denial, frugality, prudence, and perseverance&quot;. Furthermore, writes Bierstedt, &quot;it may be said that Sumner spent his entire life as a preacher of sermons&quot;. However, Sumner &quot;preferred the classroom to the pulpit&quot;, so he left the ministry and returned to Yale in 1872 as &quot;professor of political and social science&quot; until he retired in 1909. Sumner taught the first course in North America called &quot;sociology&quot;.

Other than what he said in the ordination service, there is no information about what motivated Sumner to be ordained. At his ordination, Sumner said that he thought that he was &quot;truly called&quot; to the ministry.

Sumner did not make known, at least publicly, his reasons for leaving the ministry. However, he and historians suggest that it might have been a loss of belief and/or a dim view of the church and its clergy.

Clarence J. Karier says, &quot;Sumner found that his deity vanished with the years.&quot; &quot;I have never discarded beliefs deliberately&quot;, Sumner said later in life, but &quot;I left them in a drawer and, after a while, when I opened it there was nothing there at all.&quot; Harris E. Starr found that Sumner &quot;never attacked religion&quot; or &quot;assumed a controversial attitude toward it.&quot; At the same time, Starr found that during Sumner&#x27;s time as a professor he stopped attending Trinity Church, New Haven, where he had been ordained deacon. After that, Sumner attended church only occasionally. However, in the closing years of his life, he baptized a little grandson, and not long before his death he attended New Haven&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s Church to receive Holy Communion. Starr wrote that these two events &quot;suggest that deep down in his nature a modicum of religion remained.&quot;

In his book &quot;What Social Classes Owe to Each Other&quot; (1883), Sumner argued that the &quot;ecclesiastical prejudice in favor of the poor and against the rich&quot; worked &quot;to replunge Europe into barbarism.&quot; Furthermore, Sumner asserted, this prejudice still lives, nourished by the clergy. &quot;It is not uncommon,&quot; he said, &quot;to hear a clergyman utter from the pulpit all the old prejudice in favor of the poor and against the rich, while asking the rich to do something for the poor; and the rich comply.&quot;

The Yale University Library&#x27;s guide to Sumner&#x27;s papers ranks him as &quot;Yale&#x27;s most dynamic teacher of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Students clamored to enroll in his classes.&quot; Sumner&#x27;s &quot;genuine love for aspiring students, commanding personality, wide learning, splendid dogmatism, and mastery of incisive English&quot; makes it easy to understand his reputation.

Sumner himself described his life as a professor as &quot;simple and monotonous.&quot; &quot;No other life could have been so well suited to my taste as this,&quot; he wrote in his autobiographical sketch.

In spite of Sumner&#x27;s description of his life as &quot;simple and monotonous,&quot; he was &quot;a champion of academic freedom and a leader in modernizing Yale&#x27;s curriculum.&quot; This led Sumner into conflict with Yale&#x27;s president, Noah Porter who, in 1879, asked Sumner not to use Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Study of Sociology&quot; in his classes. &quot;Sumner saw this as a threat to academic freedom and bluntly refused Porter&#x27;s request. The faculty soon split into two factions one supporting and the other opposing Sumner&#x27;s defiance.&quot; Sumner stood his ground and won out.

Until his 1890 illness, Sumner wrote and spoke constantly on the economic and political issues of the day. His &quot;acidic style&quot; outraged his opponents, but it pleased his supporters. The rest of Sumner&#x27;s life at Yale was routine. In 1909, the year of his retirement, Yale awarded Sumner an honorary degree.

Although Sumner was a professor of political science, his actual involvement in politics was limited to two things he reported in his autobiographical sketch. In 1873–1876, he served as an alderman in New Haven. In 1876, researching the contested presidential election, he went with a group to Louisiana to find &quot;what kind of a presidential election they had that year.&quot; Sumner said that was his &quot;whole experience in politics.&quot; From this experience, he concluded, &quot;I did not know the rules of the game and did not want to learn.&quot;

===Retirement and death===
Sumner&#x27;s health deteriorated steadily beginning in 1890, and after 1909, the year of his retirement, it &quot;declined precipitously.&quot; In December 1909, while in New York to deliver his presidential address to the American Sociological Society, Sumner suffered his third and fatal paralytic stroke. He died April 12, 1910, in Englewood Hospital in New Jersey.

Sumner spent much of his career as a muckraker, exposing what he saw as faults in society, and as a polemicist, writing, teaching, and speaking against these faults. In spite of his efforts, his career ended with pessimism about the future. Sumner said, &quot;I have lived through the best period of this country&#x27;s history. The next generations are going to see wars and social calamities.&quot;

==Economics==
Sumner was a staunch advocate of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics, as well as &quot;a forthright proponent of free trade and the gold standard and a foe of socialism.&quot; Sumner was active in the intellectual promotion of free-trade classical liberalism. He heavily criticized state socialism/state communism. One adversary he mentioned by name was Edward Bellamy, whose national variant of socialism was set forth in &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, published in 1888, and the sequel &quot;Equality&quot;.

==Anti-imperialism==
Like many classical liberals at the time, including Edward Atkinson, Moorfield Storey, and Grover Cleveland, Sumner opposed the Spanish–American War and the subsequent U.S. effort to quell the insurgency in the Philippines. He was a vice president of the Anti-Imperialist League which had been formed after the war to oppose the annexation of territories. In 1899 he delivered a speech titled &quot;The Conquest of the United States by Spain&quot; before the Phi Beta Kappa Society of Yale University. In what is considered by some to be &quot;his most enduring work,&quot; he lambasted imperialism as a betrayal of the best traditions, principles, and interests of the American people and contrary to America&#x27;s own founding as a state of equals, where justice and law &quot;were to reign in the midst of simplicity.&quot; In this ironically titled work, Sumner portrayed the takeover as &quot;an American version of the imperialism and lust for colonies that had brought Spain the sorry state of his own time.&quot; According to Sumner, imperialism would enthrone a new group of &quot;plutocrats,&quot; or businesspeople who depended on government subsidies and contracts.

==Sociologist==
As a sociologist, his major accomplishments were developing the concepts of diffusion, folkways, and ethnocentrism. Sumner&#x27;s work with folkways led him to conclude that attempts at government-mandated reform were useless.

In 1876, Sumner became the first to teach a course titled &quot;sociology&quot; in the English-speaking world. The course focused on the thought of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer, precursors of the formal academic sociology that would be established 20 years later by Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, and others in Europe. He was the second president of American Sociological Association serving from 1908 to 1909, and succeeding his longtime ideological opponent Lester F. Ward.

In 1880, Sumner was involved in one of the first cases of academic freedom. Sumner and the Yale president at the time, Noah Porter, did not agree on the use of Herbert Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Study of Sociology&quot; as part of the curriculum. Spencer&#x27;s application of supposed &quot;Darwinist&quot; ideas to the realm of humans may have been slightly too controversial at this time of curriculum reform. On the other hand, even if Spencer&#x27;s ideas were not generally accepted, it is clear that his social ideas influenced Sumner in his written works.

==Sumner and Social Darwinism==
William Graham Sumner was influenced by many people and ideas such as Herbert Spencer and this has led many to associate Sumner with social Darwinism.

In 1881, Sumner wrote an essay titled &quot;Sociology.&quot; In the essay, Sumner focused on the connection between sociology and biology. He explained that there are two sides to the struggle for survival of a human. The first side is a &quot;struggle for existence,&quot; which is a relationship between man and nature. The second side would be the &quot;competition for life,&quot; which can be identified as a relationship between man and man. The first is a biological relationship with nature and the second is a social link, thus sociology. Man would struggle against nature to obtain essential needs such as food or water and in turn this would create the conflict between man and man in order to obtain needs from a limited supply. Sumner believed that man could not abolish the law of &quot;survival of the fittest,&quot; and that humans could only interfere with it and in so doing, produce the &quot;unfit.&quot;

According to Jeff Riggenbach, the identification of Sumner as a social Darwinist:
Historian Mike Hawkins, however, argues that it is accurate to describe Sumner as a social Darwinist because Sumner draws directly upon evolutionary theory to explain society and dictate policy.

Sumner was a critic of natural rights, famously arguing:
==Warfare==
Another example of social Darwinist influence in Sumner&#x27;s work was his analysis of warfare in one of his essays in the 1880s. Contrary to some beliefs, Sumner did not believe that warfare was a result of primitive societies; he suggested that &quot;real warfare&quot; came from more developed societies. It was believed that primitive cultures would have war as a &quot;struggle for existence,&quot; but Sumner believed that war in fact came from a &quot;competition for life.&quot; Although war was sometimes man against nature, fighting another tribe for their resources, it was more often a conflict between man and man, for example, one man fighting against another man because of their different ideologies. Sumner explained that the competition for life was the reason for war and that is why war has always existed and always will.

==&quot;The Forgotten Man&quot;==
The theme of &quot;the forgotten man&quot; was developed by Sumner over a series of 11 essays published in 1883 in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, and further developed in two speeches delivered that year. Sumner argued that, in his day, politics was being subverted by those proposing a &quot;measure of relief for the evils which have caught public attention.&quot; He wrote:

Sumner&#x27;s &quot;forgotten man&quot; and its relationship to Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;forgotten man&quot; is the subject of Amity Shlaes&#x27;s &quot;The Forgotten Man&quot;.

==Legacy==
Sumner&#x27;s popular essays gave him a wide audience for his &quot;laissez-faire&quot; advocacy of free markets, anti-imperialism, and the gold standard. Sumner had a long-term influence over modern American conservatism as a leading intellectual of the Gilded Age.

Thousands of Yale students took his courses, and many remarked on his influence. His essays were very widely read among intellectuals, and men of affairs. Among Sumner&#x27;s students were the anthropologist Albert Galloway Keller, the economist Irving Fisher, and the champion of an anthropological approach to economics, Thorstein Bunde Veblen.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

* Bannister, Robert C. Jr. &quot;William Graham Sumner&#x27;s Social Darwinism: a Reconsideration&quot;. &quot;History of Political Economy&quot; 1973 5(1): 89–109. Looks at Sumner&#x27;s ideas, especially as revealed in &quot;Folkways&quot; (1906) and his other writings. Contrary to the position of the kind of social Darwinism sometimes attributed to him, he insisted equally on a distinction between the &quot;struggle for existence&quot; of man against nature and the &quot;competition of life&quot; among men in society. Sumner did not really equate might and right, and did not reduce everything finally to social power.

Sumner has usually been considered a dogmatic defender of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; and of conservative social Darwinism. But an examination of his unpublished essay of 1909, &quot;On the Concentration of Wealth&quot; (here published in full), reveals that his earlier views were subject to modification. In this 1909 essay he shows his concern for pervasive corporate monopoly as a threat to social equality and democratic government. His analysis was akin to that of a Wilsonian Progressive, although his remedies were vague and incomplete. This stand against plutocracy was consistent with his life and consisted of a long defense of a middle-class society against the pressures of greedy self-interest groups and demos, the mob. Earlier he was most concerned with threats from corrupt politicians. Later plutocracy threatened the middle classes through abuses which might have led to class warfare.
* Curtis, Bruce. &quot;William Graham Sumner and the Problem of Progress&quot;. &quot;New England Quarterly&quot; 1978 51(3): 348–369. Fulltext in Jstor. Sumner was one of the few late-19th-century Americans to reject a belief in inevitable human progress. Influenced by his understanding of Darwinism, Malthusian theory, and the second law of thermodynamics, he came to believe the ancient doctrine of cycles in human affairs and in the universe. Based on Sumner&#x27;s classroom notes and other writings.
* Curtis, Bruce. &quot;Victorians Abed: William Graham Sumner on the Family, Women and Sex&quot;. &quot;American Studies&quot; 1977 18(1): 101–122. . Asks, did a Victorian consensus concerning sexuality exist? Sumner&#x27;s life reveals many tensions and inconsistencies, although he generally supported the sexual status quo. His ideal of the middle-class family, nonetheless, led him to oppose the double sexual standard and to question the idea of a stable Victorian consensus on sexuality. He supported humane divorce policies and kinder treatment for prostitutes, and recognized women as sexual beings.
* Garson, Robert and Maidment, Richard. &quot;Social Darwinism and the Liberal Tradition: the Case of William Graham Sumner&quot;. &quot;South Atlantic Quarterly&quot; 1981 80(1): 61–76. . Argues Sumner, drew upon themes and ideas that were firmly established in the political consciousness of Americans. The introduction of such devices as the struggle for survival and the competition of life served in fact to dramatize and highlight some of the central concerns of liberalism. When Sumner did repudiate certain fundamental premises of the liberal tradition, he did so on the grounds that the tradition was misconstrued and not because it was unsustainable. He did not discard liberal theory nor did he lose sight of its principal threads.

Sumner shared many intellectual assumptions with 18th-century Scottish moral philosophers, such as Adam Smith, Thomas Reid, and Dugald Stewart. They were part of ethical naturalism. The major reason for this ideological kinship was the historical fact that Scottish moral philosophy was one of the major sources for modern social science. Sumner&#x27;s &quot;Folkways&quot; [1907] illustrates the Scottish influence.

<text>Henry Talmage &quot;Hammerin&#x27; Hank&quot; Elrod (September 27, 1905December 23, 1941) was a US Marine Corps aviator. He was the first aviator to receive the Medal of Honor during World War II, for his heroism in the defense of Wake Island.

==Marine Corps service==
Elrod was born on September 27, 1905, in Turner County, Georgia. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in December 1927, and was appointed a Marine second lieutenant in February 1931. He attended the University of Georgia and Yale University prior to his entry into the Marine Corps.

Following over a year at the Marine Corps Basic School in Philadelphia as a student aviator, Lieutenant Elrod was ordered to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. There he served as a company officer and as student aviator. In February 1935, he earned his wings and was transferred to Marine Corps Base Quantico, where he served as a Marine Aviator until January 1938. In addition to his other duties, he was his squadron&#x27;s school, personnel, and welfare officer.

In July 1938, Elrod was ordered to a squadron in San Diego and served as their material, parachute, and personnel officer until January 1941, when he was detached to the Hawaiian area.

On December 4, 1941, Captain Elrod flew to Wake Island with twelve aircraft, twelve pilots, and the ground crew of Major Paul A. Putnam&#x27;s fighter squadron, VMF-211. Hostilities in the air over Wake Island commenced on December 8, 1941. On December 12, he single-handedly attacked a flight of 22 enemy planes and shot down two. He executed several low-altitude bombing and strafing runs on enemy ships; during one of these attacks, he became the first man to sink a warship, the Japanese destroyer , with small-caliber bombs delivered from a Wildcat fighter aircraft, dropping the bombs onto the destroyer&#x27;s stern, causing the depth charges to explode.

When all the U.S. aircraft had been destroyed by Japanese fire, he organized remaining troops into a beach defense unit which repulsed repeated Japanese attacks. On December 23, 1941, Captain Elrod was mortally wounded while protecting his men who were carrying ammunition to a gun emplacement.

He was posthumously promoted to major on November 8, 1946, and his widow was presented with the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions during the defense of Wake Island. His widow, the former Elizabeth Hogun Jackson, was the niece of Admiral Richard H. Jackson and served as a commissioned officer in the United States Marine Corps.

Major Elrod was initially buried on Wake Island, but was reinterred in Arlington National Cemetery in October 1947.

==Posthumous honors==
The main road leading in to the Marine Corps Officer Candidate School is named after Elrod.

The City of Ashburn, Georgia (the county seat of Turner County) dedicated a park to Elrod in 2010.

The U.S. Navy &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigate, , is named in his honor. In 1995 Elrod was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame.


==Awards==

Note – all the awards above, except for the American Defense Service Medal and a previous award of the Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, were awarded posthumously.

===Medal of Honor citation===
The President of the United States takes pride in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR posthumously to

for service as set forth in the following CITATION:

&quot;For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while attached to Marine Fighting Squadron TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN, during action against enemy Japanese land, surface and aerial units at Wake Island, from 8 to 23 December 1941. Engaging vastly superior forces of enemy bombers and warships on 9 and 12 December, Captain Elrod shot down two of a flight of twenty-two hostile planes and, executing repeated bombing and strafing runs at extremely low altitude and close range, succeeded in inflicting deadly damage upon a large Japanese vessel, thereby sinking the first major warship to be destroyed by small caliber bombs delivered from a fighter-type aircraft. When his plane was disabled by hostile fire and no other ships were operative, Captain Elrod assumed command of one flank of the line set up in defiance of the enemy landing and conducting a brilliant defense, enabled his men to hold their positions and repulse determined Japanese attacks, repeatedly proceeding through intense hostile fusillades to provide covering fire for unarmed ammunition carriers. Capturing an automatic weapon during one enemy rush in force, he gave his own firearm to one of his men and fought on vigorously against the Japanese. Responsible in a large measure of the strength of his sector&#x27;s gallant resistance, on 23 December, Captain Elrod led his men with bold aggressiveness until he fell, mortally wounded. His superb skill as a pilot, daring leadership and unswerving devotion to duty distinguished him among the defenders of Wake Island, and his valiant conduct reflects the highest credit upon himself and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.&quot;

<doc id="547561" wikidata="Q534001" url="?curid=547561" title="Hiroyuki Takei">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist, best known as the creator of the popular &quot;Shaman King&quot;.

==Career==
Hiroyuki Takei started drawing manga with writer EXIAD on SD Département Store Series which they created for a fanzine. Early in his career, he became the assistant to Tamakichi Sakura on &quot;&quot; as in 1992 and Kōji Kiriyama (&quot;Ninku&quot;). At that time, he also submitted his first yomikiri Dragdoll Group to the Tezuka Award but was rejected. In 1994, Takei submitted his short story &quot;Anna the Itako&quot; to the 48th Tezuka Award and won the honorable mention. He was later introduced to Nobuhiro Watsuki and became his assistant along with Eiichiro Oda on &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;.

Takei published his short story &quot;Death Zero&quot; in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; winter special and &quot;Butsu Zone&quot; in the summer special of 1996. A reworked version of &quot;Butsu Zone&quot; became his first manga series published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; of 1997. Takei&#x27;s longest-running series, &quot;Shaman King&quot; began serialization in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; in 1998, though was forced to conclude in 2004. In 2007, Takei returned three years after the conclusion of &quot;Shaman King&quot; with a new &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; series, entitled &quot;Jumbor Barutronica&quot;. Set in the distant future, construction workers pilot mecha. One of them is killed and his memories are implanted in his clone, a thirty-year-old man in a five-year-old superpowered construction tool body. The series was canceled after ten issues and released in one volume.

During the Jump Festa 2008, Shueisha announced a kanzenban reprint of &quot;Shaman King&quot;. This release reprinted the entire series in 27 volumes complete with new covers while concluding the never-before-published &quot;true ending.&quot; On March 4, 2008, Japanese publisher Shūeisha announced that Takei would be collaborating on &quot;Karakuri Dôji Ultimo&quot; with American comic creator Stan Lee. The project launched with the new &quot;Jump SQ.II&quot; (Jump Square Second) spinoff manga magazine on April 18, 2008. The announcement of the partnership was made in the April issue of &quot;Jump Square&quot; magazine.

As of 2010, Takei is working on two monthly series: &quot;Jumbor&quot;, written by and &quot;Karakuri Dôji Ultimo&quot; with Stan Lee.

On February 15, 2017, when answering a fan&#x27;s question, Hiroyuki Takei revealed on his official Twitter that he received an offer for an anime remake of his representative work &quot;Shaman King&quot;, but had to turn it down because they were not able to use the first anime&#x27;s voice actors and soundtrack music. In June 2020, a new anime television series was announced, which aired from April 1, 2021 to April 21, 2022 and featured several returning cast members from the 2001 anime series in both the Japanese and the English dub.

==Inspiration==
Takei named Hirohiko Araki&#x27;s series &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; and &quot;Baoh&quot; as his favorite manga when he was younger. In an interview with &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;, he also cited &quot;Taiyo Kosoku&quot; by Baru, &quot;Blade of the Immortal&quot; by Hiroaki Samura, and &quot;Hellboy&quot; by Mike Mignola as favorites. Takei has also been influenced by American comic books, Mecha anime and Osamu Tezuka.

<text>A tarn (or corrie loch) is a mountain lake, pond or pool, formed in a cirque (or &quot;corrie&quot;) excavated by a glacier. A moraine may form a natural dam below a tarn.

==Etymology==

The word is derived from the Old Norse word &quot;tjörn&quot; (&quot;a small mountain lake without tributaries&quot;) meaning pond. In parts of Northern England – predominantly Cumberland and Westmorland (where there are 197), but also areas of North Lancashire and North Yorkshire – &#x27;tarn&#x27; is widely used as the name for small lakes or ponds, regardless of their location and origin (e.g. Talkin Tarn, Urswick Tarn, Malham Tarn). Similarly, in Scandinavian languages, a &quot;tjern&quot; or &quot;tjørn&quot; (both Norwegian) or &quot;tjärn&quot; or &quot;tärn&quot; (both Swedish) is a small natural lake, often in a forest or with vegetation closely surrounding it or growing into the tarn. The name of the Tjörnin in Reykjavik, Iceland is also from a related word.

The specific technical use for a body of water in a glacial corrie comes from high number of tarns found in corries in the Lake District, an upland area in North-West England. Nonetheless, there are many more bodies of water called &#x27;tarn&#x27; in the Lake District than actually fit this technical use.

The Scots language word &quot;shon&quot;/&quot;shun&quot; (&quot;a small loch&quot;) may too be derived from Old Norse &quot;tjørn&quot;, perhaps under the influence of &quot;sjø&quot; (&quot;sea; fresh water lake&quot;).

==Formation==
Tarns are the result of small glaciers called cirque glaciers. Glacial cirques (or &#x27;corries&#x27;) form as hollows on mountainsides near the firn line. Eventually, the hollow in which a cirque glacier develops may become a large bowl shape in the side of the mountain, caused by weathering, by ice segregation, and as well as being eroded by plucking. The basin will become deeper as it continues to be eroded by ice segregation and abrasion. A cirque typically will be partially surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs, with a fourth side a form of moraine constructed from glacial till, which forms the &quot;lip&quot;, &quot;threshold&quot; or &quot;sill&quot;, from which either a stream or glacier will flow away from the cirque.

Tarns form from the melting of the cirque glacier. They may either be seasonal features as supraglacial lakes, or permanent features which form in the hollows left by cirques in formerly glaciated areas.

<text>Carlos Andrés Pérez Rodríguez (27 October 1922 – 25 December 2010) also known as CAP and often referred to as &quot;El Gocho&quot; (due to his Andean origins), was a Venezuelan politician who served as the 47th and 50th president of Venezuela from 1974 to 1979 and again from 1989 to 1993. He was one of the founders of Acción Democrática, the dominant political party in Venezuela during the second half of the twentieth century.

After the fall of dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez and returning from exile, Pérez served as the interior affairs minister for Rómulo Betancourt between 1959 and 1964, when he became known for his tough response against guerrillas. His first presidency was known as the &quot;Saudi Venezuela&quot; due to its economic and social prosperity thanks to enormous income from petroleum exportation. However, his second presidency saw a continuation of the economic crisis of the 1980s, a series of social crises, widespread riots known as Caracazo and two coup attempts in 1992. In he became the first Venezuelan president to be forced out of office by the Supreme Court on charges for the embezzlement of bolívars (roughly 2.7 million US dollars) belonging to a presidential discretionary fund, whose money was used to support the electoral process in Nicaragua and hire bodyguards for President Violeta Chamorro.

==Early life and education==
Carlos Andrés Pérez was born at the hacienda &quot;La Argentina&quot;, on the Venezuelan-Colombian border near the town of Rubio, Táchira state, the 11th of 12 children in a middle-class family. His father, Antonio Pérez Lemus, was a Colombian-born coffee planter and pharmacist of Spanish Peninsular and Canary Islander ancestry who emigrated to Venezuela during the last years of the 19th century. His mother, Julia Rodríguez, was the daughter of a prominent landowner in the town of Rubio and the granddaughter of Venezuelan refugees who had fled to the Andes and Colombia in the wake of the Federal War, a civil war that ravaged Venezuela in the 1860s.

Pérez was educated at the María Inmaculada School in Rubio, run by Dominican friars. His childhood was spent between the family home in town, a rambling Spanish colonial-style house, and the coffee haciendas owned by his father and maternal grandfather. Influenced by his grandfather, an avid book collector, Pérez read voraciously from an early age, including French and Spanish classics by Jules Verne and Alexandre Dumas. As he grew older, Pérez also became politically aware and managed to read Voltaire, Rousseau, and Marx without the knowledge of his deeply conservative parents.

The combination of falling coffee prices, business disputes, and harassment orchestrated by henchmen allied to dictator Juan Vicente Gómez, led to the financial ruin and physical deterioration of Antonio Pérez, who died of a heart attack in 1936. This episode would force the widow Julia and her sons to move to Venezuela&#x27;s capital, Caracas, in 1939, where two of Pérez&#x27;s eldest brothers had gone to attend university. The death of his father had a profound impact on the young Pérez, bolstering his convictions that democratic freedoms and rights were the only guarantees against the arbitrary, and tyrannical, use of state power.

In Caracas, Pérez enrolled in the renowned &quot;Liceo Andrés Bello&quot;, where he graduated in 1944 with a major in Philosophy and Letters. In 1944, he enrolled for three years in the Law School of the Central University of Venezuela and one year in the Law School of the Free University of Colombia. However, the intensification of his political activism would prevent Pérez from ever completing his law degree.

==Political life==

The political life of Carlos Andrés Pérez began at the age of 15, when he became a founding member of the Venezuelan Youth Association and a member of the National Democratic Party, both of which were opposed to the repressive administration of General Eleazar López Contreras, who had succeeded the dictatorship of Juan Vicente Gómez in 1935. He also co-operated with the first labour unions in his region. When he moved to Caracas, in 1939, he started an ascendant political career as a youth leader and founder of the Democratic Action (AD) party, in which he would play an important role during the 20th century, first as a close ally to party founder Rómulo Betancourt and then as a political leader in his own right.

In October 1945, a group of civilians and young army officers plotted the overthrow of the government run by General Isaías Medina Angarita. At the age of 23, Pérez was appointed Private Secretary to the Junta President, Rómulo Betancourt, and became Cabinet Secretary in 1946. However, in 1948, when the military staged a coup against the democratically elected government of Rómulo Gallegos, Pérez was forced to go into exile (going to Cuba, Panama and Costa Rica) for a decade. He temporarily returned to Venezuela secretly in 1952 to complete special missions in his fight against the new dictatorial government. He was imprisoned on various occasions and spent more than two years in jail in total. In Costa Rica, he was active in Venezuelan political refugee circles, worked as Editor in Chief of the newspaper &quot;La República&quot; and kept in close contact with Betancourt and other AD leaders.

In 1958, after the fall of dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, Pérez returned to Venezuela and participated in the reorganization of the AD Party. He served as Minister of Interior and Justice from 1959 to 1964 and made his mark as a tough minister and canny politician who worked to neutralize small, disruptive and radical right-wing and left-wing insurrections, the latter Cuban-influenced and Cuban-financed, that were being staged around the country. This was an important step in the pacification of the country in the mid-to-late 1960s, the consolidation of democracy and the integration of radical parties into the political process. Pérez was accused, however, of human rights violations during his tenure.

After the end of the Betancourt administration and the 1963 elections, Pérez left government temporarily and dedicated himself to consolidating his support in the party. During this time, he served as head of the AD in Congress and was elected to the position of Secretary General of AD, a role that was crucial in laying the ground for his presidential ambitions.

===First presidency===
In 1973, Carlos Andrés Pérez was nominated to run for the presidency for AD. Youthful and energetic, Pérez ran a vibrant and triumphalist campaign, one of the first to use the services of American advertising gurus and political consultants in the country&#x27;s history. During the run up to elections, he visited nearly all the villages and cities of Venezuela by foot and walked more than 5800 kilometers. He was elected in December of that year, receiving 48.7% of the vote against the 36.7% of his main rival. Turnout in these elections reached an unprecedented 97% of all eligible voters, a level which has not been achieved since.

One of the most radical aspects of Pérez&#x27;s program for government was the notion that petroleum oil was a tool for developing countries like Venezuela to attain first world status and usher a fairer, more equitable international order. International events, including the Yom Kippur War of 1973, contributed to the implementation of this vision. Drastic increases in petroleum prices during the 1970s energy crisis led to an economic bonanza for the country just as Pérez started his term. Using high oil prices, Pérez bolstered his support, buying patronage by subsidizing prices, increasing wages and tripling public spending. His policies, including the nationalization of the iron and petroleum industries. Following the establishment of PDVSA, corruption in Venezuela as a system of patrimonialism was created. He also promoted investment in large state-owned industrial projects for the production of aluminium and hydroelectric energy, infrastructure improvements and the funding of social welfare and scholarship programmes, were ambitious and involved massive government spending, to the tune of almost . His measures to protect the environment and foster sustainable development earned the Earth Care award in 1975, the first time a Latin American leader had received this recognition.

In the international arena, Pérez supported democratic and progressive causes in Latin America and the world. He reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba and submitted a resolution to the Organization of American States (OAS) that would have lifted economic sanctions against the country. He opposed the Somoza and Augusto Pinochet dictatorships and played a crucial role in the finalizing of the agreement for the transfer of the Panama Canal from American to Panamanian control. In 1975, with Mexican President Luis Echeverría, he founded SELA, the Latin American Economic System, created to foster economic cooperation and scientific exchange between the nations of Latin America. He also supported the democratization process in Spain, as he brought Felipe González, who was living in exile, back to Spain in a private flight and thus strengthened the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE). Additionally, he negotiated a treaty with the USSR that called for the USSR to supply oil to Venezuela&#x27;s Spanish market in exchange for Venezuela supplying the Soviet market in Cuba.

Towards the end of his first term in office, Pérez&#x27;s faced criticism for excessive government spending. His administration was often referred to as Saudi Venezuela for its grandiose and extravagant ambitions. In addition, there were allegations of corruption and trafficking of influence, often involving members of Pérez&#x27;s intimate circle, such as his mistress Cecilia Matos, or financiers and businessmen who donated to his election campaign, known as the &quot;Twelve Apostles&quot;. A well-publicized rift with his former mentor Betancourt and disgruntled members of AD all pointed to the fading of Pérez&#x27;s political standing. By the 1978 elections, there was a sense among many citizens that the influx of petrodollars after 1973 had not been properly managed. The country was importing 80% of all foodstuffs consumed. Agricultural production was stagnant. The national debt had skyrocketed. And whilst per capita income had increased and prosperity was evident in Caracas and other major cities, the country was also more expensive and a significant minority of Venezuelans were still mired in poverty. This malaise led to the defeat of AD at the polls by the opposition Social Christian Party. The newly elected president, Luis Herrera Campíns, famously stated in his inaugural speech that he was &quot;inheriting a mortgaged country.&quot;

==== Post-first term ====

Carlos Andrés Pérez maintained a high profile in international affairs. In 1980, he was elected president of the Latin American Association of Human Rights. He collaborated with Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere in the organization of the South-South Commission. He actively participated in the Socialist International, where he served as vice-president for three consecutive terms, under the presidency of Willy Brandt from West Germany. Willy Brandt and Carlos Andrés Pérez, together with the Dominican Republic&#x27;s José Francisco Peña Gómez, expanded the activities of the Socialist International from Europe to Latin America. In 1988, he became a Member of the Council of Freely-Elected Heads of Government, established by the former President of the United States, Jimmy Carter. He was elected Chairman of the Harvard University Conference on Foreign Debt in Latin America, in , and received the Henry and Nancy Bartels World Affairs Fellowship at Cornell University.

===Second presidency===
He based his campaign for the 1988 Venezuelan general election in his legacy of abundance during his first presidential period and initially rejected liberalization policies. Venezuela&#x27;s international reserves were only US$300 million at the time of Pérez&#x27; election into the presidency; Pérez decided to respond to the debt, public spending, economic restrictions and rentier state by liberalizing the economy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) offered Venezuela a loan for US dollars with the condition of the application of austerity measures. Carlos Andrés announced a technocratic cabinet and a group of economic policies to fix macroeconomic imbalances known as &quot;&quot; (), called by detractors as &quot;El Paquetazo Económico&quot; (). Pérez implemented such reforms without the support of political groups, including his own AD party, resulting with the AD blocking his future policies in Congress and pulling its support, with many perceiving the package as an act of betrayal.

Among the policies there was the reduction of fuel subsidies and the increase of public transportation fares by thirty percent (VEB 16 Venezuelan bolívares, or US$0.4). The increase was supposed to be implemented on 1 March 1989, but bus drivers decided to apply the price rise on 27 February, a day before payday in Venezuela. In response, protests and rioting began on the morning of 27 February 1989 in Guarenas, a town near Caracas, known as El Caracazo. a lack of timely intervention by authorities, as the was on a labor strike, led to the protests and rioting quickly spreading to the capital and other towns across the country. The response resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency and led to a large number of deaths, ranging from the official estimate of 277 dead to extraofficial estimates of up to 5,000, the most violent period of unrest in Venezuela&#x27;s democratic history. The deaths were attributed to Pérez&#x27;s implementation of Plan Ávila, which resulted with authorities killing protesters.

Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reported that human rights in Venezuela deteriorated during Pérez&#x27;s administration, with the latter human rights groups writing in 1993 that his &quot;tenure was marked by an increase in human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions, torture, extrajudicial executions, the violent repression of popular demonstrations and protests.&quot; Torture in Venezuela during the Carlos Andrés Pérez administration was common according to Amnesty international, with the group saying that while the government and its laws condemned human rights abuses, authorities still performed torture methods that were &quot;simple but sophisticated: they are designed to cause maximum pain with the minimum of marks.&quot; The human rights group further reported that poor citizens, including minors, were often victims of police raids and arbitrary detention, being subsequently tortured on many occasions.

By late 1991, Carlos Andrés Pérez&#x27; administration received a total of US$2.287 billion due to privatization reforms. The most notable auction was CANTV&#x27;s, a telecommunications company, which was sold at the price of US$1.885 billion to the consortium composed of American AT&amp;T International, General Telephone Electronic and the Venezuelan Electricidad de Caracas and Banco Mercantil. The privatization ended Venezuela&#x27;s monopoly over telecommunications and surpassed predictions, selling over US$1 billion above the base price and US$500 million more than the bid offered by its next competitor. By the end of the year, inflation had dropped to 31%, Venezuela&#x27;s international reserves were now worth US$14 billion and there was an economic growth of 9% (called as an &quot;Asian growth&quot;), the largest in Latin America at the time. Overall, the results of liberalization policies were mixed; by 1992 many of the achievements were reversed, inflation remained between thirty and forty percent and Venezuela did not become macro-economically stable. The main accomplishment during this period was that Venezuela was finally able to pay international debtors.

In 1992, his government survived two coup attempts. The first attempt took place 4 February 1992, and was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Hugo Chávez, who was later elected president. With the attempt having clearly failed, Chávez was catapulted into the national spotlight when he was allowed to appear live on national television to call for all remaining rebel detachments in Venezuela to cease hostilities. When he did so, Chávez famously quipped on national television that he had only failed &quot;por ahora&quot;—&quot;for now&quot;. The second, and much bloodier, insurrection took place on 27 November 1992, with many more deaths than in the first case. Multiple reports of political opponents, grassroots activists and students being tortured occurred during the period when the Pérez suspended constitutional guarantees.

===Impeachment===
On 20 March 1993, Attorney General introduced action against Pérez for the embezzlement of bolivars belonging to a presidential discretionary fund, or &quot;partida secreta&quot;. The issue had originally been brought to public scrutiny in by journalist José Vicente Rangel. The money was used to support the electoral process in Nicaragua, and during the process it was revealed that the money was used to support and hire bodyguards for President Violeta Chamorro. On 21 May 1993, the Supreme Court considered the accusation valid, and the following day the Senate voted to strip Pérez of his immunity. Many of those in the Senate who supported Pérez&#x27;s impeachment were members of AD. Pérez refused to resign, but after the maximum 90 days temporary leave available to the President under Article 188 of the 1961 constitution, the National Congress removed Pérez from office permanently on 31 August.

==Post-presidency==
Pérez&#x27; trial concluded in May 1996, and he was sentenced to 28 months in prison.

In 1998 he was prosecuted again, this time on charges of embezzlement on public funds, accused of having secret joint bank accounts held in New York with his mistress, Cecilia Matos. Before the trial, he was elected to the Senate of Venezuela for his native State of Táchira, on the ticket of his newly founded party, &quot;Movimiento de Apertura y Participación Nacional&quot; (Apertura), thus gaining immunity from prosecutions. However, as the newly approved 1999 Constitution of Venezuela dissolved the Senate and created a unicameral National Assembly, Pérez lost his seat. In 1999 he ran again for the National Assembly, but did not gain a seat. On 20 December 2001, while in Dominican Republic, a court in Caracas ordered his detention, on charges of embezzlement of public funds. On 3 February 2002 he was formally asked in extradition.

After that, he self-exiled in Miami, Florida, from where he became an opponent of President Hugo Chávez. On 23 October 2003, at 80 years old, he suffered a stroke that left him partially disabled. While in Miami, following the Daktari Ranch affair, Pérez said that the plot was a hoax but that Chávez had to be forcibly removed, saying that &quot;Chávez has rejected all the peaceful exits that have been presented to him&quot; and &quot;it is not that I am in favor of violence, but that there is no other way out of Chavez&quot;.

In 2009, Venezuelan attorney general Luisa Ortega Díaz ordered the extradition of Pérez due to his implementation of the Plan Ávila.

==Personal life==
At the age of 26 he married his first cousin Blanca Rodríguez with whom he had six children: Sonia, Thais, Martha, Carlos Manuel, María de Los Angeles and María Carolina. In the late 1960s, he began an extramarital relationship with his then secretary Cecilia Matos. He also had two daughters with Cecilia, María Francia and Cecilia Victoria Pérez, while married to Blanca Rodríguez. Matos became a notorious figure in Venezuelan politics beginning in the 1970s and through the 1990s, the result of rumours of corruption and trafficking of influence centred around her role as the President&#x27;s mistress. Such allegations of corruption were damaging to Pérez&#x27;s political standing. Although Pérez initiated divorce proceedings against his wife in 1998, the action failed and was discontinued. Until his death (see below), Pérez remained legally married to Blanca Rodríguez although he had been living in exile since 1998 with Matos, dividing his time between his homes in Miami, the Dominican Republic and New York. In 2003, he suffered a debilitating stroke that seriously affected his mental and physical abilities. On 31 March 2008, the secretary general of Acción Democrática, Henry Ramos Allup, announced that Pérez wanted to return to Venezuela from exile, to spend his last years in Caracas.

==Death==

On 25 December 2010, Pérez was rushed to Mercy Hospital in Miami, where he died that same afternoon. The cause of death was initially reported as having been a heart attack, but was later referred to as &quot;respiratory failure&quot;. It later emerged that Blanca Rodríguez and Pérez&#x27;s four daughters and son learned of Pérez&#x27;s death from a news website, as neither Matos nor her daughters notified them of the loss. Chávez offered condolences, but commented that he hopes Pérez&#x27;s way of governing would not return to the country: &quot;May he rest in peace. But with him ... may the form of politics that he personified rest in peace and leave here forever.&quot; Pérez&#x27;s relatives in Miami said that Pérez would be buried in Miami and that they have no intention of returning his remains to Venezuela until Chávez was no longer in office. Less than 24 hours before the burial, legal representatives for Blanca Rodríguez obtained a court order to stop the ceremony. The order was based on Blanca Rodríguez&#x27;s legal right as Pérez&#x27;s widow to determine where he would be buried. It was reported that Miami relatives agreed to her wish to return Pérez&#x27;s body to Venezuela but later they denied having reached to an agreement. On 4 October 2011, the remains of Carlos Andrés Pérez were brought back to Venezuela, nine months after his death. The casket arrived in a flight originated from Atlanta, Georgia, escorted by Mayor of Caracas Antonio Ledezma, friend of Pérez and member of Democratic Action (AD). Once in Caracas it was transported to the Headquarters of AD, where over 5,000 people waited to see the hearse and the casket covered with the Venezuelan flag. Pérez remains were interred on Thursday 6 October 2011. Cecilia Matos died in Bogotá, Colombia, of &quot;kidney and respiratory problems,&quot; one of her daughters told Efe. She was 66. The death of Cecilia Matos came 25 days after Pérez was buried in Venezuela, following a prolonged family dispute about where his final resting place should be.

== In popular culture ==
The documentary film &quot;CAP 2 Intentos&quot; (&quot;English:&quot; CAP 2 Attempts), directed by , focuses on the two non-consecutive presidential tenures of Andrés Pérez.

Oteyza later released another documentary, &quot;CAP Inédito&quot; (CAP Unedited), featuring including previously unpublished material and from a private point of view.

<text>Mora is a genus of large trees in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae of the legume family Fabaceae (or in some classifications the family Caesalpinaceae of the order Fabales). There are six species, all native to lowland rainforests in northern South America, southern Central America, the southern Caribbean islands, and Hispaniola. 
==Species==
*&quot;Mora abbottii&quot; — cola tree, coi, col (Dominican Republic)
*&quot;Mora ekmanii&quot; (Hispaniola - Dominican Republic, Haiti)
*&quot;Mora excelsa&quot; — nato, nato rojo, mora (Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela)
*&quot;Mora gonggrijpii&quot; — Moraboekea (Guyana, Suriname, Venezuela)
*&quot;Mora oleifera&quot; ( (Panama, Colombia)
*&quot;Mora paraensis&quot; — pracuuba (Brazil)
==Description==
These are large, heavily buttressed rainforest trees up to in height (to in the case of &quot;M. excelsa&quot;). The genus is particularly noteworthy for the exceptional size of its beans, which are commonly acknowledged to be the largest known dicot seeds, in the instance of &quot;M. oleifera&quot; being up to in length, in breadth and in thickness, and a weight of up to . These very large beans develop out of tiny flowers with a pistil only one millimeter wide involving a growth of over 2,000,000 fold. The species &quot;M. excelsa&quot; is one of the few rainforest trees to grow in pure stands.

==Uses==
The beans of &quot;Mora&quot; spp. are edible if boiled, and are also the source of a red dyestuff. 
Some of the species are important for timber production. &quot;Mora excelsa&quot; and &quot;Mora gonggrijpii&quot; are also known as nato, and are commonly used in guitar body and neck construction.

<text>(also called Power Office Girls) is a comedic TV drama serial based on the Japanese manga of the same name by , though much of the details (all besides the company name and the characters) have departed from the comic. Released in 1998, Shomuni was a surprise winner of the ratings war for drama serials aired in Japan between April and June, despite being projected to finish a lowly thirteenth in a survey conducted by a major TV station.

==Story==
The stories revolve around the &quot;office ladies (OL)&quot; of General Administration Section 2 (&quot;Shomu ni&quot;, or GA-2) in a large multinational company called Manpan Corporation.

GA-2 is called &quot;the graveyard for female office ladies&quot;, simply because it is the place where female employees are dumped should they mess up big time elsewhere. Rarely is anyone ever allowed to leave for other more purposeful departments. Jobs include replacing used toilet rolls, changing light bulbs, organizing company outings, and other menial tasks. GA-2 is located in the basement, which is in fact a disused store room.

The purpose of GA-2 is to convince these errant – or simply useless – employees to quit (and typically people last three days at most) due to the monotonous and meaningless nature of the job, just so that the company, headed by sex-crazed executives and a Personnel Section willing to stoop to any means, will save on the costs of firing them.

However, the employees posted to GA-2 exhibit no intention to quit, to the chagrin of the Personnel Section Chief and his assistant , since the people at Shomuni are happy their menial jobs give them more than enough time to pursue their other interests during office hours.

As the drama series progresses, it is evident that these seemingly lowly employees have their own pride despite them being the most despised employees in the company, and in every episode, they end up saving the company from a potential catastrophe, inadvertently or otherwise.

GA-2 has one male employee, the friendly and affable Section Chief , whose role can at best be described as that of a nominal caretaker. Save for caring for a female tabby cat, he is an old man who appears to be only interested in waiting for his retirement age while idling in the GA-2 office.

==Characters==

GA-2 was composed of four women from the start of the first episode, and is seen first through the eyes of Tsukahara Sawako (the fifth woman to join GA-2).

# is the tallest person in GA-2 and is also often their leader. She is responsible for carrying the ladder which GA-2 uses for fixing lightbulbs. Her uniform skirt is shorter than those of the other women in GA-2. Chinatsu believes that a woman&#x27;s worth is determined by how many men she &quot;conquers&quot;, or sleeps with (Episode 1). Before she entered Manpan Corporation, she used to work as a nightclub hostess (episode 1).
# has a past which few people know about. She is often not seen having lunch with her fellow GA-2 colleagues in the company canteen, for she spends lunch hour with different male high-ranking executives of the company. In episode 6 of the first season, it is revealed that Kana was the tenth mistress of Manpan&#x27;s late president, and that he sent her expensive gifts of jewelry
# is the second oldest employee in GA-2, after Section Chief Inoue. Nobody in GA-2 seems to remember how she ended up in GA-2. She is responsible for making announcements as well as drawing up the daily company routines of GA-2. Highly interested in stock investments. Azusa is also trying to find a husband, and once slipped a personals ad into the folder of a high powered executive.
# is the quirkiest of the GA-2 members. Her mother sells antiques and her father has a photocopy store. She has a night job as a fortune teller at night after work at GA-2 – and her predictions are never wrong. Her foresight often sparks an entire episode, depending on GA-2&#x27;s interpretation on her prediction. Much of her comic appeal comes from her deadpan delivery.
# is the youngest (at age 21) employee in GA-2, and is very incompetent at getting the job done correctly due to her extremely simple and innocent manner. After knocking down the president of Manpan Corporation in an elevator lobby (as the result of a fight between her and a wronged wife in an elevator) she was posted to GA-2. She is in love with Mr. Ukyo, and Azusa labels her to be &#x27;ambitious&#x27;.
# At the end of the third episode, she became the sixth member of GA-2. She attended elementary school with Chinatsu, and is one of the few people who can get Chinatsu visibly angry. In episode 7, Ume tells Sawako she remembers Chinatsu as &quot;...a big crybaby who got nicknamed Gassy Chinatsu.&quot; Highly ambitious, she is learning several languages (such as Arabic) and aims to leave GA-2 as soon as she can. She is a computer analyst, and specializes in acquiring information.

Each of the twelve episodes usually focuses on the developments of one character of Shomuni. Each episode is independent of another, except for the season&#x27;s finale.

==Sequel==
Two sequels to Shomuni were made, as well as three Special movie editions. Shomuni was followed up by two TV movies: Shomuni Special 1 (aired on October 7, 1998), Shomuni Special 2 (aired on January 2, 2000), and two sequel drama serials: Shomuni 2 (aired April 12, 2000 – June 28, 2000) and the other was Shomuni Final (July 3, 2002 – September 18, 2002). A third TV movie, Shomuni Forever, was aired on January 1, 2003, to round off the drama series.[2] In the end, each individual leave GA-2 2 months apart from one another. Tsukahara is last.

In 2013, another Shomuni were made since the previous season departure on 2002, known as Shomuni 2013 or Shomuni 4/Power Office Girls 4, premiering on Fuji TV on July 10. Led by the same actress Esumi Makiko as the main protagonist, this season were completely backed up by a total new cast as supporting.

<doc id="547611" wikidata="Q1261300" url="?curid=547611" title="John Norquay">
<text>John Norquay (May 8, 1841 – July 5, 1889) was the fifth premier of Manitoba from 1878 to 1887. He was born near St. Andrews in what was then the Red River Colony, making him the first premier of Manitoba to have been born in the region. Norquay was also the first Indigenous Premier of a Canadian province, a title which is now honourarily held by Louis Riel.

==Early life==
Norquay came from an Anglo-Métis ethnic background (the contemporary term used was &quot;half-breed&quot;, which was not then considered offensive and is even an important constitutional designation, given the rights afforded to them in the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; of 1870). He was educated by Church of England bishop, David Anderson, and worked as a teacher, farmer, and fur trader during the 1860s.

==Early political career==
Norquay played only a minor role in the events of Louis Riel&#x27;s Red River Rebellion (1869–70), but decided to enter public life shortly thereafter. He was acclaimed for the riding of High Bluff in Manitoba&#x27;s first general election (December 27, 1870), and soon became a leader in the &quot;mixed-blood&quot; community.

In 1871, Manitoba&#x27;s parliamentary opposition agitated for the removal of Alfred Boyd, the provincial secretary. When this opposition became impossible to ignore, he resigned. In withdrawing from office, Boyd suggested that someone from Manitoba&#x27;s &quot;mixed-blood&quot; community be called to cabinet in his place (Manitoba&#x27;s government was balanced along ethnic, religious and linguistic lines in this period, but British &quot;mixed-bloods&quot; had been left out of the first cabinet). Norquay was accordingly called to serve as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Agriculture.

While still serving as a provincial cabinet minister, Norquay attempted to enter federal politics in the general election of 1872. Running in the riding of Marquette, he was defeated by Robert Cunningham, an ally of Louis Riel. He would not run for federal office again.

Manitoba&#x27;s first government (which did not have a premier) lost a vote of confidence in July 1874, after Norquay&#x27;s electoral redistribution bill met with opposition from both English and French MLAs. Norquay did not serve in the cabinet of Marc-Amable Girard (1874), nor was he called into the first cabinet of Robert A. Davis (1874–1878). In Manitoba&#x27;s second election (December 30, 1874), he was a leader of the opposition; running in St. Andrew&#x27;s South, he defeated former Girard minister Edward Henry Hay by 67 votes to 34.

The 1874 election resulted in a hung parliament, with Davis&#x27;s support coming primarily from French-speaking constituencies. Davis knew that he would be unable to govern effectively without strong British representation, and invited Norquay to join his cabinet in March 1875. Norquay accepted, and brought with him enough parliamentary support to ensure the ministry&#x27;s continued survival.

==Premiership==
Norquay was a prominent minister in the Davis administration, and it was not a surprise when he was called to replace Davis as Premier in November 1878 (he also took the office of Provincial Treasurer). He sought a new mandate on December 18, 1878, and was re-elected with the support of 14-17 MLAs (out of 24). Norquay faced a tough challenge in his own constituency from one John Allan, but won by 62 votes to 54.

In early 1879, Norquay faced a more serious challenge after losing the support of Joseph Royal. Royal was an ultramontane Catholic and the undisputed leader of the Francophone parliamentary bloc. Like Norquay, he had been a prominent minister in the Davis administration (in fact, he had often referred it as the &quot;Davis-Royal&quot; administration). Now, he sought to forge a new parliamentary alliance with opposition leader Thomas Scott, an Orangeman and a leading figure among the new Ontario settlers (not to be confused with the man of the same name executed by Louis Riel) in 1870. Royal and Scott wanted to bring formal party politics to Manitoba; both were Conservatives, and Scott believed that he was best positioned to become the leader of a provincial Conservative Party. Norquay was also affiliated with the federal Conservatives, but relied on support from local Liberals to keep his government intact. Accordingly, he wanted to preserve the province&#x27;s &quot;non-partisan&quot; character.

Norquay countered the Royal-Scott &quot;coup attempt&quot; by forging a new parliamentary alliance with all of the province&#x27;s British MLAs (except Scott), and expelling his French Canadian ministers from cabinet. This reconstituted ministry then sought to pass a variety of bills which were detrimental to Francophone interests.

Norquay did not follow through on the worst of his ministry&#x27;s threats. He recognized the need for conciliation, and soon convinced former premier, Marc-Amable Girard, to rejoin cabinet as provincial secretary. Norquay would later argue that his &quot;anti-French&quot; ministry was an unpleasant political necessity. The Norquay-Girard government won a new mandate on December 16, 1879, with Norquay re-elected by acclamation in the riding of St. Andrew&#x27;s.

===Railway development===
In terms of the legislation it promoted, Norquay&#x27;s ministry may be described as interventionist but not particularly ambitious. Like many other Canadian politicians in the 19th century, Norquay devoted much of his attention to railway development. As a result, he was compelled to walk a thin line between local and federal alliances; eventually, his inability to successfully navigate this course led to his downfall.

During the 1880s, many entrepreneurs in Manitoba tried to develop local rail lines to reduce transportation costs. Although popular with farmers and merchants, these plans were opposed by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), which had a guaranteed 20-year monopoly on &quot;western travel&quot; through the area (some historians have argued that the &quot;local service lines&quot; were a financial impossibility to begin with). Although Norquay initially gave tepid support to these local efforts, the opposition accused him (probably correctly) of having made a secret deal with the CPR and John A. Macdonald, Canadian prime minister, to ensure that they never came to fruition. When Macdonald disallowed Norquay&#x27;s half-hearted railway legislation in 1882, a coherent local opposition began to form around Thomas Greenway, whose &quot;Provincial Rights&quot; group would soon become the Manitoba Liberal Party.

These developments brought Norquay into a reluctant alliance with the province&#x27;s Conservative establishment (which had opposed him only three years earlier). While Norquay still claimed to be non-partisan, his MLAs were recognized as the de facto Conservative Party within Manitoba. In Manitoba&#x27;s fifth election (January 23, 1883), &quot;Liberal-Conservative&quot; and &quot;Conservative&quot; candidates won 19 of 30 seats between them; all were regarded as Norquay supporters, set against a Liberal opposition. Formal party government would not arrive until 1888, but a functional two-party system was already in place.

Although John A. Macdonald was sometimes disparaging of Norquay in private correspondence, he supported the Norquay ministry for most of its nine years in power. Macdonald took Norquay&#x27;s side in a boundary dispute with Ontario, and personally visited Manitoba in 1886 to ensure Norquay&#x27;s re-election on December 9 of that year: Norquay&#x27;s Conservatives won about 21 seats, compared to 14 for Greenway&#x27;s Liberals with the popular vote almost evenly split. Without Macdonald&#x27;s visit, Norquay probably would have been defeated.

Norquay&#x27;s alliance with Macdonald ended in the summer of 1887, when the provincial government reversed its previous policy and actively promoted the Red River Valley Railway, a local line meant to link Winnipeg with the Canada–United States border. Macdonald and the CPR would both play leading roles in Norquay&#x27;s downfall later in the year.

Due to the opposition of Macdonald and the C.P.R., Norquay&#x27;s government became delinquent on payments for the construction of the Red River Valley Railway. As a result, Norquay&#x27;s government was sued by prominent Canadian railway magnate Hugh Ryan, whose firm H. &amp; J. Ryan was awarded the contract for the Red River Valley Railway. The scandal further contributed to Norquay&#x27;s growing image problem amongst his constituents and was worsened when the courts sided with Ryan; with Ryan being awarded $50,000 for unpaid work (the equivalent of $1.6 million in 2024).

===Defeat===
In September 1887, the Norquay government was accused of using trust funds for Métis children as general revenue. Norquay himself faced extreme pressure to resign, particularly after a tour of eastern cities for railway loans ended without success. His ministry&#x27;s fate was sealed when Macdonald disallowed the transfer of CPR land to Manitoba, after Norquay&#x27;s government had already paid $256,000 to the company in compensation. Norquay was abandoned by his ministers, and resigned on December 23, 1887. His successor, David H. Harrison, unsuccessfully tried to keep Norquay&#x27;s governing alliance together for another month; after this, Greenway was called upon to form a new ministry.

Greenway&#x27;s Liberals won a landslide victory on July 11, 1888. Norquay was narrowly re-elected in Kildonan, defeating Liberal Duncan McArthur by 305 votes to 303. He once again became leader of the opposition, but with a much reduced political base: he was now opposed by John A. Macdonald, distrusted by other Manitoba Conservatives, lacking in popular support, and suffering personal financial hardship. He died on July 5, 1889, without having attained a reversal in his fortunes.

==Legacy==
Despite the tragedy of his last years, Norquay was generally successful in developing Manitoba during his time in office. Between his first election in 1870 and his resignation in 1887, the population of Manitoba had grown tenfold; as Premier, Norquay was responsible for expanding government services accordingly.

In addition to his political career, John Norquay was also a prominent lay member of the Church of England in Manitoba. Beginning in 1875, he was regularly elected as a representative to the synod of the Diocese of Rupert&#x27;s Land.

It may be added that Norquay&#x27;s career was relatively free of racial prejudice. He was the victim of some racial slurs (Legislative Councilor Donald Gunn once referred to him as &quot;Greasy John&quot;), but his longevity in office suggests that Manitobans were willing to accept an aboriginal premier, despite the tensions caused by Louis Riel&#x27;s rebellions.

In 1904, Mount Norquay in Banff National Park was named after him. Norquay attempted to climb the mountain in 1887 or 1888 but contrary to some reports, did not reach the summit. Poor health and route difficulties presented by the mountain were the likely reasons for not reaching the top.

<text>( ) is a 1981 puzzle video game developed by husband and wife team Randy and Sandy Pfeiffer and published in arcades by Taito America. &quot;Qix&quot; is one of a handful of games made by Taito&#x27;s American division (another is &quot;Zoo Keeper&quot;). At the start of each level, the playing field is a large, empty rectangle, containing the &quot;Qix&quot;, an abstract stick-like entity that performs graceful but unpredictable motions within the confines of the rectangle. The objective is to draw lines that close off parts of the rectangle to fill in a set amount of the playfield.

&quot;Qix&quot; was ported to the contemporary Atari 5200 (1982), Atari 8-bit computers (1983), and Commodore 64 (1983), then was brought to a wide variety of systems in the late 1980s and early 1990s: MS-DOS (1989), Amiga (1989), another version for the C64 (1989), Apple IIGS (1990), Game Boy (1990), Nintendo Entertainment System (1991), and Atari Lynx (1991).

Multiple home and arcade sequels followed and the concept was widely cloned. In the &quot;Gals Panic&quot; series from Kaneko, each captured area is not filled with a color, but reveals part of an image of a woman; this itself had been cloned into erotic-oriented games based on the concept of &quot;Qix&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Controls consist of a four-direction joystick and two buttons: &quot;Slow Draw&quot; and &quot;Fast Draw&quot;.

The player controls a diamond-shaped marker that initially moves along the edges of the playfield. Holding down one of the draw buttons allows the marker to draw a line (&quot;Stix&quot;) in unclaimed territory in an attempt to create a closed shape. Once an area is captured, it is filled with color and points are awarded based on the area claimed and drawing speed. Areas captured entirely with Slow Draw (orange-red in the screenshot) are worth double. The titular &quot;Qix&quot; is a colorful geometric figure in constant and random motion. The Qix will not actively seek out the marker, and it will not harm the marker if it collides with it while the marker is traversing the edge of the playfield or of any captured area. However, if the Qix collides with the marker as it is drawing a Stix before a new area is captured (or it touches the exposed Stix), one life is lost.

The marker cannot cross or backtrack along the line being drawn. If the marker stops while drawing, a fuse appears and burns along the line toward the marker; if it reaches the marker, the player loses one life. The fuse disappears once the marker is moved. If the player draws into a position where it cannot proceed any further, the fuse is triggered. The attract mode calls this a &quot;Spiral Death Trap&quot;.

&quot;Sparx&quot; are enemies that traverse all playfield edges except unfinished Stix. A life is lost if one hits the marker. A meter at the top of the screen counts down to the release of additional Sparx and the mutation of all Sparx into Super Sparx, which can chase the marker along uncompleted Stix.

To complete a level, the player must claim a 75% percentage of the playfield (adjustable to be between 50% and 90%). If a level is completed by exceeding the minimum area percentage, a bonus is awarded for every 1% beyond the threshold.

Starting in level three, the player faces two Qixes. Splitting the playfield into two regions, each containing one Qix, ends the level. No immediate bonus is awarded for this, but a bonus multiplier is applied to the scoring in all subsequent levels. This multiplier starts at one before the first time that the Qix are split and increases by one for every additional splitting of the Qix, to a maximum of nine. Levels also add additional Sparx and the eventual appearance of only Super Sparx.

==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;Qix&quot; was a commercial hit. In 1983, &quot;Electronic Games&quot; reported that the game exceeded Taito&#x27;s expectations, quickly rising to being one of the most popular titles of the year. The magazine attributes the game&#x27;s success to it being unlike any other game at the time, specifically for its unique premise and gameplay mechanics. A year after its debut, its popularity declined and the game became largely forgotten. Keith Egging, Taito&#x27;s &quot;Director of Creativity&quot;, told &quot;Electronic Games&quot;: &quot;&quot;Qix&quot; was conceptually too mystifying for gamers. [...] It was impossible to master and once the novelty wore off, the game faded&quot;. In Japan, it was the fifth highest-grossing arcade game of 1981. The game has since been dubbed a sleeper hit.

&quot;Qix&quot; and its home conversions have received largely positive reviews. The game was praised for its original concept and ideas, and has been described as a cultural phenomenon. &quot;Video&quot;, who reviewed the Atari 5200 release, applauded its gameplay and bizarre yet interesting premise. They reported similar reactions from players, who enjoyed its mechanics and gameplay. &quot;Video&quot; staff described the game as being a &quot;cult phenomenon loved by a few and ignored by&quot; more hardcore gamers. The home computer versions of &quot;Qix&quot; were praised by Russel Sipe of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; for its fascinating gameplay and for welcoming newcomers. In &quot;How to Beat the Video Games&quot; Michael Blanchet said that &quot;&#x27;Qix&quot; is probably the most complicated video game to emerge in years, yet its simplicity is beautiful. I think of it as electronic real estate. [...] &quot;Qix&quot; is a state of the art &quot;Etch a Sketch.&quot;&#x27;

Retrospective coverage of &quot;Qix&quot; has also been positive. &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Brett Alan Weiss commended &quot;Qix&quot; for its addictive gameplay, technological accomplishments, and responsive controls. While he believed the graphics and sound effects were overly simplistic and crude, he said the game as a whole is &quot;abstract minimalism at its videogame best&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; staff enjoyed &quot;Qix&quot; particularly for its addictive nature. They also compared its concept to that of the Etch A Sketch, a mechanical toy that allowed its user to draw straight lines across a small screen. The staff believed the game&#x27;s simplicity was also one of its strong points, alongside its sound effects for being satisfying to hear.

=== Accolades ===
At the 5th annual Arkie Awards in 1984, &quot;Qix&quot; received the Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;1984 Best Videogame Audio-Visual Effects (16K or more ROM)&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; ranked the game 94th on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot; In 1997, the staff at &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed the Nintendo Entertainment System version at #100 on their &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot; for its risk-versus-reward system and scoring. The Killer List of Videogames listed it as #27 in their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; list.

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
&quot;Qix II: Tournament&quot; (1982) is a version of the original &quot;Qix&quot; with a new color scheme and which awards an extra life when 90% or more of the screen is enclosed. &quot;Super Qix&quot; was released in 1987. Another sequel, &quot;Twin Qix&quot;, reached a prototype stage in 1995, but was never commercially released. The later game &quot;Volfied&quot;, also known as &quot;Ultimate Qix&quot; on Sega Genesis or &quot;Qix Neo&quot; on PlayStation, was also released on several mobile phones.

A port to the Game Boy developed by Nintendo was released in 1990, with intermissions in which Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach have cameo appearances. In one, he is seen in a desert wearing Mexican clothing and playing a guitar with a vulture looking on. The outfit later appears as a costume that Mario can wear in &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot;. The Game Boy port was released as a Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console title in Japan on June 15, 2011, and in North America and Europe on July 7.

In 1999, a remake for the Game Boy Color was released called &quot;Qix Adventure&quot;. The player travels on a map screen, taking on opponents which appear on the playing field. Although optional, enclosing an opponent in the box opens a treasure chest, which can also be enclosed, giving the player an item. &quot;Battle Qix&quot; was released for the PlayStation in 2002 by Success, under their &quot;Super 1500 Lite&quot; budget title series. It includes a remake of the original &quot;Qix&quot; alongside a competitive multiplayer mode. Taito released a new version of &quot;Qix&quot; for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Portable &quot;Qix++&quot; in December 2009.

<text>Watts S. Humphrey (July 4, 1927 – October 28, 2010) was an American pioneer in software engineering who was called the &quot;father of software quality.&quot;

== Biography ==
Watts Humphrey (whose grandfather and father also had the same name) was born in Battle Creek, Michigan on July 4, 1927.
His uncle was US Secretary of the Treasury George M. Humphrey.
In 1944, he graduated from high school and served in the United States Navy.
Despite dyslexia, he received a bachelor of science in physics from the University of Chicago, a master of science in physics from Illinois Institute of Technology physics department, and a master of business administration from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.

In 1953 he went to Boston and worked at Sylvania Labs.
In 1959 he joined IBM.
In the late 1960s, Humphrey headed the IBM software team that introduced the first software license. Humphrey was a vice president at IBM.

In the 1980s at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University Humphrey founded the Software Process Program, and served as director of that program from 1986 until the early 1990s. The program was funded by the Department of Defense (DOD) because it was in need of a solution for software being developed that was defective, consistently late, and over budget. This program was aimed at understanding and managing the software engineering process because this is where big and small organizations or individuals encounter the most serious difficulties and where, thereafter, lies the best opportunity for significant improvement.

In 1987 Humphrey published an SEI Technical Report (CMU/SEI-87-TR-11) that defined five levels of process maturity: (1) Initial, (2) Repeatable, (3) Defined, (4) Managed, and (5) Optimized. In 1989 he described how to use the five levels for managing and improving software development processes in a book titled &quot;Managing the Software Process&quot; When SEI released the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) in 1991, it was based on the principles in his book. Subsequently, DOD required organizations that developed software for it to have at least a level 3 process maturity level. Humphrey also published books on the concepts of the personal software process (PSP) and the team software process (TSP). The five levels of process maturity were later adopted for use in two standards: ISO/IEC 15504 (later superseded by ISO/IEC TS 33061) and the Business Process Maturity Model (BPMM) published by Object Management Group (OMG). Both standards applied the five levels to processes in general, not just to software development processes.

Humphrey received an honorary doctor of software engineering from the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 1998.
The Watts Humphrey Software Quality Institute in Chennai, India was named after him in 2000.
In 2003, Humphrey was awarded the National Medal of Technology. 
Humphrey became a fellow of the SEI and of the Association for Computing Machinery in 2008.

<text>Robert Atkinson Davis (March 9, 1841 – January 7, 1903) was a businessman and Manitoba politician who served as the fourth premier of Manitoba.

Davis was born in Dudswell, in the eastern townships of Lower Canada (now Quebec). As a young man, he worked in the mining fields of the US Rockies. He moved to Red River on 10 May 1870, and reportedly had a friendly meeting with Louis Riel shortly before the end of the Red River Rebellion. This meeting took place after Davis swam across the Red River to where Riel was hiding and called out to the guards in French, and the entire meeting took place in French as Davis was bilingual. Davis purchased a hotel in September 1870. This investment proved very profitable, and he was soon able to open several other stores in Winnipeg.

Davis assumed a significant role in Manitoba politics after the death of his first wife in 1872. He emerged as a spokesman for the province&#x27;s recent Ontario immigrants, who opposed the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s monopoly on transportation and opposed the continued prominence of the Métis in Manitoba politics.

Davis challenged HBC commissioner Donald Alexander Smith for the Presidency of the Provincial Agricultural Association in 1872. He lost this race, but was elected to both the Protestant school board and the new Winnipeg Board of Trade in February 1873. Davis also helped create the Manitoba society called &quot;The Grange&quot; in 1874.

In April 1874, Davis won a by-election to the provincial legislature for the riding of Winnipeg &amp; St. Johns (replacing Smith, who had resigned). He soon emerged as a leading figure in the opposition, and on July 2, 1874, supported a no-confidence motion which brought down the government. The next day, Marc-Amable Girard was called to lead a ministry based on principles of &quot;responsible government&quot;. Davis became the Provincial Treasurer and sought to achieve debt elimination and &quot;better terms&quot; from Ottawa.

The Girard government fell apart in November–December 1874 as a result of ethnic tensions. Davis, the only minister not to resign during this crisis, was called upon to form a new government. He was 33 years old. Like his predecessors, he recognized the importance of demographic balance and appointed French-Canadian Joseph Royal as his Provincial Secretary.

Davis was re-elected for Winnipeg in Manitoba&#x27;s second general election (December 30, 1874), defeating Thomas Scott (not to be confused with the Thomas Scott executed by Louis Riel&#x27;s provisional government) by 198 votes to 183. His ministry won the support of the &quot;French party&quot;, but did not attain an overall majority in parliament until Davis formed a new alliance with former minister John Norquay. The Davis government was primarily opposed by the anglophone allies of John Christian Schultz, who were led in parliament by Orangeman Francis Cornish. Through his alliance with Royal, Davis could count on support from the &quot;French party&quot; throughout his term in office.

As premier, Davis continued his policy of debt reduction (for which he attained an increased Federal subsidy), and convinced the unelected Legislative Council to vote itself out of existence in January 1876. He supported a proposal that the planned transcontinental railway run through Winnipeg rather than Selkirk. After John A. Macdonald was re-elected as Canada&#x27;s prime minister in 1878, this change was accomplished.

Davis resigned as premier in 1878, and subsequently became a successful businessman in Chicago. He argued in favour of Canada–US free trade in 1883, and spent much of the 1890s travelling on the profits of his business. He died of Bright&#x27;s Disease in 1903 in Phoenix, Arizona.

<text>Lancing College is a public school (English private boarding and day school) for pupils aged 13–18 in southern England, UK. The school is located in West Sussex, east of Worthing near the village of Lancing, on the south coast of England. Lancing was founded in 1848 by Nathaniel Woodard and educates c. 600 pupils between the ages of 13 and 18; the co-educational ratio is c. 60:40 boys to girls. Girls were admitted beginning in 1971. The first co-ed, Saints’ House, was established in September 2018, bringing the total number of Houses to 10. There are 5 male houses (Gibbs, School, Teme, Heads, Seconds) and 4 female houses (Fields, Sankeys, Manor, Handford).

== Overview ==
The college is situated on a hill which is part of the South Downs, and the campus dominates the local landscape. The college overlooks the River Adur, and the Ladywell Stream, a holy well or sacred stream within the College grounds, has pre-Christian significance.
Woodard&#x27;s aim was to provide education &quot;based on sound principle and sound knowledge, firmly grounded in the Christian faith,&quot; and the discipline of the prefect&#x27;s cane. However John Dancy was appointed headmaster in 1953 to improve academic standards, which had taken second place to prowess in sport. Lancing was the first of a family of more than 30 schools founded by Woodard. Other schools include Ardingly College, Bloxham School, The Cathedral School, Denstone College, and Ellesmere College.

Roughly 65% of pupils are either full or weekly boarders, at a cost of £17,773 per term; 35% are day pupils, at a cost of £12,147 per term. Occasional overnight stays are available to day pupils at an additional cost of £89 per night.

The school is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference. Girls were first admitted in 1970. The school is dominated by a Gothic revival chapel, and follows a high church Anglican tradition. The College of St Mary and St Nicolas (as it was originally known) in Shoreham-by-Sea was intended for the sons of upper middle classes and professional men; in time this became Lancing College, moving to its present site in 1857.

The school&#x27;s buildings of the 1850s were designed by the architect Richard Cromwell Carpenter, with later ones by John William Simpson.

In 2003, it was one of fifty of the country&#x27;s leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared.

== Chapel ==


The college Chapel is a Grade I Listed building that was finally completed in 2022. The first phase of its construction began in 1863 with the installation of the foundations of the building, completed five years later. One report states that the foundations are 60 feet (18 metres) deep. The structure itself would not be fully completed until long after Woodard&#x27;s death in 1891, although the tower at the west end that had been planned in the 1800s would not be built as of 2024;. the tower had been intended to raise the height to 100 metres. The apex of the vaulting rises to 27.4 m (90 ft). It was designed by R. H. Carpenter and William Slater, and is built of Sussex sandstone from Scaynes Hill.

By 18 July 1911, the upper chapel had been built and went into use after its consecration and dedication to St Mary and St Nicholas; this phase of the work was completed through the efforts of Woodard’s son, William. &quot;Despite a shortage of funds, he turned all the vaults and oversaw the completion of all but two bays of the main interior ...&quot; according to a 2024 report. The listing by Historic England provides this more specific summary of the Gothic Revival upper chapel at that time:The main portion of the Chapel was finished in 1911. It consists of an apse and 10 bays. Central portion with aisles. Great buttresses flank the windows of the aisles. Over the roof of the aisles double flying buttresses connect the buttresses below to the walls of the main building. Balustrade of pointed arcading. Slate roof. Prior to July 1911, the college had worshipped in the finished crypt since that was consecrated in 1875.

Before the final completion of the chapel in the 21st century, additional work was completed over the decades. As of May 1978, the structure contained among other things, the tomb of the founder, three organs, and a rose window designed by Stephen Dykes Bower, completed in 1977, and the largest rose window built since the Middle Ages, being 32 ft in diameter. It was added by James Longley Construction, a building company which operated from 1863 to 2020, and was also involved in the building of Christ’s Hospital near Horsham. Some reports state that the structure is the largest school chapel in the world.

The eastern organ is a two-manual mechanical organ built by the Danish firm Frobenius and was installed and voiced &quot;in situ&quot; in 1986. That year also marked the completion of the rebuild of the four-manual Walker organ at the west end of the chapel – both of which were showcased in the opening concert by the American organ virtuoso, Carlo Curley.

A stained-glass window was commissioned in memory of Trevor Huddleston OL, and consecrated by Desmond Tutu on 22 May 2007. The west wall of the chapel was built between 1960 and 2017. That area had remained bricked up since 1978 when bricks replaced the previous corrugated iron facade.

In 2019, permission was obtained for building the western three-arched porch that had been designed by Michael Drury. During this phase, the brickwork in the facade was also completed as were the chapel&#x27;s buttresses.

Lancing College Chapel was closed to visitors during the coronavirus pandemic and, subsequently, during the construction of the west end porch and refurbishment work on the school kitchens opposite, reopening to the public on 25 April 2022.

== Campus ==
During World War II, students were evacuated to Downton Castle in Herefordshire. Both the main college and the prep school buildings were requisitioned by the Admiralty and became part of the Royal Navy shore establishment .

== Developments ==

In 1856 Lancing created its own code of football which (unlike other school codes) was regarded as a means of fostering teamwork.

<doc id="547644" wikidata="Q5933735" url="?curid=547644" title="Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist is given each year for artists of works related to science fiction or fantasy which appeared in low- or non-paying publications such as semiprozines or fanzines. A Hugo Award for professional artists is also given. The Hugo Awards have been described as &quot;a fine showcase for speculative fiction&quot; and &quot;the best known literary award for science fiction writing&quot;.

The fan award was first presented in 1967 and has been awarded annually. Beginning in 1996, Retrospective Hugo Awards, or &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954, although only the 1946 and 1951 Retro Hugos received sufficient nominations for the Fan Artist Hugo to make the ballot.

Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are those six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near Labor Day and in a different city around the world each year.
During the 60 nomination years, 84 artists have been nominated; 34 of these have won, including co-winners and Retro Hugos. Brad W. Foster has received the largest number of awards, with 8 wins out of 27 nominations. William Rotsler and Tim Kirk have won five awards, from twenty-three and eight nominations respectively. The only other artists to win more than twice are Teddy Harvia, with four out of twenty nominations, Alexis A. Gilliland, with four out of eight, and Frank Wu, also with four out of eight.

== Winners and nominees ==
In the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Artists are eligible based on their work of the previous calendar year. Entries with a yellow background and an asterisk (*) next to the artist&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a gray background are the nominees on the short-list.

  *   Winners

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years in which a Worldcon was hosted, but no awards were originally given. Retro Hugos have been awarded eight times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954. Only the 1946 and 1951 Retro Hugos received enough nominations for the Fan Artist Hugo to make the ballot.

<text>Wilbert Vere Awdry (15 June 1911 – 21 March 1997), often credited as Rev. W. Awdry, was an English Anglican minister, railway enthusiast, and children&#x27;s author. He is best remembered as the creator of Thomas the Tank Engine and several other characters who appeared in his &quot;Railway Series&quot;.

==Life and career==
Wilbert Awdry was born at Ampfield vicarage near Romsey, Hampshire, on 15 June 1911. His father was Vere Awdry (1854–1928), the Anglican vicar of Ampfield, and his mother was Lucy Awdry (née Bury; 1884–1965). When Wilbert was born his mother Lucy Awdry described her newborn son as a &quot;short but (but perfectly formed) baby who had long fingers. and toes, a &#x27;mouse-face&#x27; (with the Awdry chin and ears) and a loud and persistent voice.&quot;. Vere Awdry was the son of judge Sir John Wither Awdry and brother of bishop William Awdry. &quot;Wilbert&quot; was derived from William and Herbert, names of his father&#x27;s two brothers. His younger brother, George, was born on 10 August 1916 and died on 27 October 1994. All three of Awdry&#x27;s older half-siblings from his father&#x27;s first two marriages died young, the youngest being killed in World War I. As a toddler at Ampfield, he saw his father construct a handmade , model railway. In 1917, the family moved to Box, in Wiltshire, moving again within Box in 1919 and in 1920, the third house being &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (renamed from &quot;Lorne Villa&quot;), which remained the family home until August 1928.

&quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; was only from the western end of Box Tunnel, where the Great Western Railway main line climbs at a gradient of 1 in 100 for . A banking engine was kept there to assist freight trains up the hill. Those trains usually ran at night, and the young Awdry could hear them from his bed, listening to the coded whistle signals between the train engine and the banker, as well as the sharp bark from the locomotive exhausts as they fought their way up the incline. When Awdry lay in bed he described the sound of the engines: &quot;It needed little imagination&quot;, he wrote, &quot;to hear, in the sounds the train engine and banking engine made, what they were saying to each other.&quot; &quot;There was no doubt in my mind that steam engines all had definite personalities. I would hear them snorting up the grade and little imagination was needed to hear in the puffings and pantings of the two engines the conversation they were having with one another.&quot; There was the inspiration for the story of Edward helping Gordon&#x27;s train up the hill, a story that Wilbert first told his son Christopher some 25 years later, and which appeared in the first of the Railway Series books.

Awdry was educated at Marlborough House School, Hawkhurst, Kent (1919–1924), Dauntsey&#x27;s School, West Lavington, Wiltshire (1924–1929), St Peter&#x27;s Hall, Oxford (BA, 1932), and Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, where he gained his diploma in theology in 1933. He taught for three years from 1933 to 1936 at St George&#x27;s School, Jerusalem, then part of Mandatory Palestine. He was ordained to the Church of England diaconate in 1936 and subsequently the priesthood. In 1938, he married Margaret Emily Wale (1912 – 21 March 1989). In 1940, he took a curacy at St Nicolas Church, Kings Norton, Birmingham, where he lived until 1946. He subsequently moved to Cambridgeshire, serving as rector of Elsworth with Knapwell (1946–1950), rural dean at Bourn (1950–1953) and then vicar of Emneth, Norfolk (1953–1965). He retired from full-time ministry in 1965 and moved to Rodborough in Stroud in Gloucestershire.

The characters that would make Awdry known, and the first stories featuring them, were invented in 1942 to amuse his son Christopher during a bout of measles. After Awdry wrote &quot;The Three Railway Engines&quot;, he built Christopher a model of Edward, and some wagons and coaches, out of a wooden broomstick and scraps of wood. Christopher also wanted a model of Gordon, but the wartime shortage of materials limited Awdry to making a little 0-6-0 tank engine. Awdry said, &quot;The natural name was Thomas – Thomas the Tank Engine.&quot; Then Christopher requested stories about Thomas, which duly followed, and were published in 1946, in the book &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;.

The first book, &quot;The Three Railway Engines&quot;, was published in 1945 by Edmund Ward in Leicester. Awdry wrote 26 books in &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, the last in 1972. Christopher subsequently added further books to the series.

In 1947, 0-6-0T engine No. 1800 was built by Hudswell Clarke. It spent its working life at the British Sugar factory in Peterborough, pushing wagons of sugar beet, until it was finally replaced by a diesel engine. Peterborough Railway Society purchased the engine in 1973, and that little blue &quot;Thomas&quot; engine is the star of the Nene Valley Railway.

In 1952, Awdry volunteered as a guard on the Talyllyn Railway in Wales, then in its second year of preservation. The railway inspired Awdry to create the Skarloey Railway, based on the Talyllyn, with some of his own exploits being written into the stories.

Awdry&#x27;s enthusiasm for railways did not stop at his publications. He was involved in railway preservation, and built model railways which he took to exhibitions around the country. At Emneth, he created an extensive model railway network in his loft, based on Barrow-in-Furness. Emneth was also close to three Wisbech railway stations. Emneth railway station was on the EAR line from Magdalen Road Station (now known as Watlington) to Wisbech East. Emneth station is now a private residence. The GER Wisbech and Upwell Tramway tram engines, coaches and rolling stock were similar to Toby the Tram Engine and Henrietta and the Ely to King&#x27;s Lynn mainline with Wisbech East railway station on Victoria Road. The M&amp;GN Peterborough to Sutton Bridge via Wisbech North railway station on Harecroft Road. There were also harbour lines either side of the Port of Wisbech on the River Nene – M&amp;GN Harbour West branch and GER Harbour East branch. Awdry was a passenger on Alan Pegler&#x27;s 1968 non-stop Flying Scotsman London King&#x27;s Cross to Edinburgh run.

Beginning in the 1950s, Awdry began to shift how he wrote the Railway Series and included the real-world element of the conflict between steam and diesel engines. During the 1950s, the British Railways (BR) began to modernise the railway network, withdrawing their steam engines and replacing them with the modern diesel engine. While that was happening in the real world, in Awdry&#x27;s fictional universe, he &quot;began more frequently referencing a place known as &quot;The Other Railway&quot;, often using it as a foil to his utopian Island of Sodor and treating it akin to a steam engine hell. &quot;The Other Railway&quot; represented B.R. and their callous scrapping of countless steam engines&quot;. That shifted the Railway Series from just telling fictional stories in the world Awdry created to paralleling the real world and using events that happened in real life.(Matthew,2022).

Awdry wrote other books besides those of &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, both fiction and non-fiction. The story &quot;Belinda the Beetle&quot; was about a red car. It became a Volkswagen Beetle only in the illustrations to the paperback editions.

In 1988, his second Ffarquhar model railway layout was shown to the public for the final time and was featured on an ITN News news item. He was again featured on &quot;TV-am&quot; for Thomas&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 1990. During all this, Awdry faced many battles – health problems, depression, and the deaths of his wife, brother, and close friend Teddy Boston. Five years later, he was interviewed by Nicholas Jones for the &quot;Bookmark&quot; film &quot;The Thomas the Tank Engine Man&quot;, which first aired on 25 February 1995 and was repeated again on 15 April 1997, shortly after his death.

Awdry was appointed an OBE in the 1996 New Year&#x27;s Honours List, but by that time his health had deteriorated and he was unable to travel to London. He died peacefully in his sleep in Stroud, Gloucestershire, on 21 March 1997, at the age of 85. His ashes are interred at Gloucester Crematorium.

A biography entitled &quot;The Thomas the Tank Engine Man&quot;, written by Brian Sibley, was published in 1995.

==Memorials==

A Class 91 locomotive, 91 124, used to bear the name &quot;The Rev W Awdry&quot;. A Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0ST (saddle tank) engine on the Dean Forest Railway is named &quot;Wilbert&quot; after him; and was used as the title character in Christopher Awdry&#x27;s Railway Series book &quot;Wilbert the Forest Engine&quot;.

In 2003, a stained glass window commissioned by the Awdry family was unveiled at St Edmund&#x27;s church, Emneth, Norfolk.

In 2011, a blue plaque was unveiled by his daughter Veronica Chambers at The Old Vicarage, Emneth where he lived between 1953 and 1965. In 2012 a blue plaque was unveiled at &quot;Lorne House&quot;, Box, where he lived between 1920 and 1928 when its name was &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;.

In 2013, Cambridgeshire County Council named their new offices in Wisbech Awdry House in his memory.

In 2015, a CGI representation of Awdry made a cameo appearance in the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; feature-length special &quot;Sodor&#x27;s Legend of the Lost Treasure&quot;. The character, referred to by his &quot;Railway Series&quot; alias, &#x27;The Thin Clergyman&#x27;, made several further appearances including in &quot;The Great Race&quot; (2016).

A pedestrian rail crossing bridge has been dedicated to Awdry in 2017 in the small Hampshire town of Chandlers Ford, which is very close (and has the closest railway line and station) to his birthplace of Ampfield.

In 2021, to mark the 75th anniversary of Thomas the Tank Engine, a blue plaque was unveiled at the old Rectory of Holy Trinity Church in Elsworth, Cambridgeshire. Cambridge Past, Present &amp; Future put up the plaque to mark the books he wrote there, which his family was present at. His daughter, Veronica Chambers, said she was &quot;delighted and moved&quot;.

==Letter to Christopher==

In the second book in the series, &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;, Awdry wrote this &quot;letter&quot; to his son Christopher:
&lt;poem&gt;Dear Christopher,
Here is your friend Thomas, the Tank Engine.
He wanted to come out of his station-yard and see the world.
These stories tell you how he did it.
I hope you will like them because you helped me to make them.
Your Loving Daddy&lt;/poem&gt;

Subsequent books featured a similar letter from the author, addressed to the readers of the book as &quot;Dear Friends&quot;, which introduced the background to the stories within the book.

This text also appears at the beginning of &quot;Thomas and Friends&quot; episodes from 2004 to 2012. The letter appears with a storybook showing Thomas on the front cover with &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot; at the top and &quot;By the Rev. W. Awdry&quot; at the bottom. The letter is read in voice-over by British actor Nigel Plaskitt.

<text>Cranium, Inc. was a toy and board game developer. The company was founded in 1998 by two former Microsoft executives, Richard Tait and Whit Alexander. They co-developed the &quot;Cranium&quot; board game.

==History==
After realizing that he always won at the game &quot;Pictionary&quot;, but lost more than frequently at the game &quot;Scrabble&quot;, Tait decided to make a game where everyone could win at something. Drawing inspiration from the HBDI thinking styles assessment they completed at Microsoft, Tait and Alexander aimed to create a &quot;Whole Brain&quot; game. Taking certain aspects of other favorite games, &quot;Cranium&quot; requires players to spell, draw, mold clay, and answer trivia questions. Tait and Alexander created &quot;a board-game where everyone has heroic moments&quot;. Cranium, Inc. tested and modified their new game over and over. They knew they had a hit game on their hands when one day the game testers tried to steal the game. Without having a retail outlet to sell their game, Cranium, Inc. ordered 20,000 units to be manufactured in China. Cranium, Inc. did have big name investors, such as Starbucks, where they were able to raise US$35 million. Cranium, Inc. went on to win over 130 awards and sell over 22 million games and toys. The company was bought out by Hasbro on January 4, 2008 for $77.5 million.

==Marketing and advertising==
Cranium, Inc. marketing strategies were considered unorthodox by traditional game marketing standards. Because &quot;Cranium&quot; came out after Christmas, and Cranium, Inc. did not want to compete in the traditional game buying market of toy stores, they decided to sell their game where their target audience would be. The target audience for Cranium was &quot;25-35 year old, dating yuppies who wanted to connect to each other.&quot; Cranium, Inc. partnered with its investor, Starbucks, and sold the game at over 1500 Starbucks locations. Cranium, Inc. then partnered with Barnes &amp; Noble to have their games sold at their locations. &quot;Cranium&quot; became the first game sold at the bookstore chain. Cranium, Inc. also created a membership called &quot;Club Cranium&quot; that one could sign up for using codes included in marketing brochures included in their games; the club was later discontinued after the acquisition by Hasbro.

In 1998, Cranium, Inc. had only spent $15,000, a relatively low figure, on marketing and advertising. While most other games advertised on TV, Cranium, Inc. advertised &quot;Cranium&quot; on the radio. Radio jocks would ask its listeners &quot;Cranium&quot;″s trivia questions and winners got the game for free. Also, Cranium, Inc. made partnerships where Cranium questions were featured on Delta Song Airlines napkins, Dr. Pepper bottles at KFC, and on packages of Land O&#x27; Lakes butter. Bill Furlong, Cranium, Inc.&#x27;s Director of Marketing had said that the game company &quot;was giving people a chance to try their game everywhere from the grocery store, to 30,000 feet in the air on Delta Song Airplane&quot;. Cranium, Inc. also found advertisement in celebrity endorsements. On &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, Julia Roberts stated that &quot;Cranium&quot; &quot;was the most fun game ever&quot; and that she and boyfriend Benjamin Bratt &quot;could not stop playing it. Al Gore and Bill Gates, Tait and Alexander&#x27;s former boss, even endorsed the game.

==Cranium==

&quot;Cranium&quot; is a party board game based on &quot;Ludo&quot;. It is billed as &quot;The Game for Your Whole Brain.&quot; Unlike many other party games, &quot;Cranium&quot; includes a wide variety of activities.

Giorgio Davanzo created the packaging and brand identity for the game, and Gary Baseman, co-creator of the animated series &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot;, did the art.

===Spin-offs===
&quot;Cranium Cadoo&quot;, a spin-off designed for school-aged kids (7 and up), won the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; award for 2002 from the Toy Industry Association.

&quot;Cranium Hullabaloo&quot;, a spin-off of the game aimed at young children (4 and up), won the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; award for 2003 from the Toy Industry Association.

<doc id="547663" wikidata="Q506134" url="?curid=547663" title="Marc-Amable Girard">
<text>Marc-Amable Girard (April 25, 1822 – September 12, 1892) was the second premier of Manitoba, and the first Franco-Manitoban to hold that post. The &quot;Canadian Parliamentary Guide&quot; lists Girard as having been Premier (or &quot;Chief Minister&quot;) from 1871 to 1872, but he did not have this title at the time and was not the government leader. In 1874, however, Girard led Manitoba&#x27;s first ministry to be constituted on principles of &quot;responsible government&quot;. In this sense, he may be regarded as the first Premier of Manitoba.

==Early life==
Girard was born in Varennes, Lower Canada (now Quebec).

==Political career==
He worked as a Notary Public between 1844 and 1870, and was active in local political life (serving as Mayor of Varennes at one stage). He lost an electoral bid for the Province of Canada&#x27;s Legislative Council in 1858, and a further bid for the Canadian Assembly in 1863 (losing to Parti Rouge leader A.A. Dorion in Hochelaga).

During the Riel Rebellion, Girard was sent to Manitoba by George-Étienne Cartier, leader of the Conservative Party&#x27;s Quebec wing. Girard and Joseph Royal met with Riel on August 23, 1870, and may have encouraged his flight from Winnipeg before Canadian soldiers arrived the next day. Subsequently, Girard attempted to ensure that the new province remained open to French-Canadians.

Girard was appointed Provincial Treasurer by Lieutenant-Governor Adams George Archibald on September 16, 1870, and remained in this position until March 14, 1872. Archibald was effectively his own Premier during this period; Girard was his leading minister from the francophone community.

In Manitoba&#x27;s first provincial election (December 27, 1870), Girard was elected by acclamation for the riding of St. Boniface East. He continued to hold his provincial seat after being appointed to the Senate of Canada on December 13, 1871, maintaining a controversial &quot;dual mandate&quot; for several years. (He resigned his cabinet seat soon after the Senate appointment, however.)

On December 28, 1872, Girard acquired a triple mandate being appointed to the Temporary North-West Council of Northwest Territories. He maintained an interest in the rights of French Canadians in the North West for the rest of his career.

By 1874, the Manitoba government was having difficulties maintaining its policy of &quot;conciliation&quot; among the province&#x27;s ethnic, religious and linguistic groups. In June 1874, cabinet minister John Norquay attempted to redistribute Manitoba&#x27;s electoral districts so as to reflect the increased English presence in the province. Norquay&#x27;s bill was poorly drafted, however, and met opposition from both an opposition &quot;English Party&quot; under Edward Hay, and the &quot;French Party&quot; under Joseph Dubuc. On June 22, 1874, Girard voted with the French party on a non-confidence motion which brought down the government; he was called to form his own administration the next day.

Until July 3, 1874, the government of Manitoba had been dominated by the province&#x27;s Lieutenant-Governors—Archibald (1870–1872), and his replacement Alexander Morris (1872–1877). Girard was the first elected official in Manitoba to choose his own cabinet and act as head of government.

Girard&#x27;s government was founded on an unstable alliance with Hay&#x27;s English party, and fell as a result of ongoing recriminations over Louis Riel&#x27;s Red River Rebellion (1869–70). Girard and other members of the French caucus maintained regular communications with Riel between 1870 and 1874, an association which most English parliamentarians found unpalatable. In November 1874, Ambroise Lepine, the Adjutant-General in Riel&#x27;s provisional government, was convicted of the murder of Orangeman Thomas Scott, who had been executed under Riel&#x27;s authority in 1870. In the aftermath of this decision, Girard was abandoned by his English ministers and forced to resign. He was succeeded as Premier by Robert A. Davis on December 3, 1874.

During its brief existence, Girard&#x27;s ministry promoted fiscal restraint and an effective system of auditing public accounts, also advocating the abolition of the unelected Legislative Council. It also passed a redistribution bill which allowed for 14 ridings with an English-speaking majority and 10 ridings with a French-speaking majority. Most considered this to be a fair compromise.

Girard was re-elected (again by acclamation) for the restructured riding of St. Boniface in Manitoba&#x27;s second general election (December 30, 1874). The Davis government soon won the confidence of most elected members (formal party politics had not yet been introduced to Manitoba), and Girard played only a minor role in provincial politics for the next four years.

Girard intended to run for re-election in 1878, but was opposed by a &quot;citizen&#x27;s committee&quot; which argued against his continued double mandate. This committee secured Alphonse LaRiviere&#x27;s victory by acclamation (elections during this period were sometimes determined by public meetings, rather than formal balloting).

Subsequent events soon brought Girard back into cabinet. John Norquay succeeded Davis as Premier immediately prior to the 1878 election. Norquay initially won a working majority in the new parliament, but soon saw his government threatened by an alliance of Thomas Scott (not the same as above) and Joseph Royal. Norquay was only able to retain power by forming an alliance with the province&#x27;s English MLA, and temporarily excluding French representatives from the cabinet.

The reconstituted Norquay ministry threatened to eliminate government bilingualism, and to redraw the electoral map to favour the English. Norquay recognized the continued need for conciliation, however, and secured Girard&#x27;s return to cabinet as Provincial Secretary on November 18, 1879. Girard was probably at the height of his popularity with the French community during this period, securing a compromise on bilingualism and receiving guarantees on education and representation. He returned to the Manitoba legislature in the Province&#x27;s fourth general election (December 16, 1879), being acclaimed for the riding of Baie St. Paul.

On November 16, 1881, Girard resigned as Provincial Secretary and became Minister of Agriculture and Statistics. He was unable to run in Manitoba&#x27;s fifth general election (January 23, 1883) due to a recent legal change which made his &quot;double mandate&quot; illegal. He remained on the province&#x27;s Executive Council until September 6, 1883, when he resigned.

Girard was a member of the Senate until his death (on September 12, 1892), where he supported the Conservative Party. He opposed the efforts of Thomas Greenway and D&#x27;Alton McCarthy to eliminate French-language services in Manitoba and the North West Territories, though he also condemned Louis Riel&#x27;s second rebellion in 1885.

<doc id="547674" wikidata="Q2904872" url="?curid=547674" title="Corwin Amendment">
<text>The Corwin Amendment is a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that has never been adopted, but owing to the absence of a ratification deadline, could theoretically still be adopted by the state legislatures. It would have shielded slavery within the states from the federal constitutional amendment process and from abolition or interference by Congress. 

Although the Corwin Amendment does not explicitly use the word slavery, it was designed specifically to protect slavery from federal power. The outgoing 36th United States Congress proposed the Corwin Amendment on March 2, 1861, shortly before the outbreak of the American Civil War, with the intent of preventing that war and preserving the Union. It passed Congress but was not ratified by the requisite number of state legislatures.

Several Southern states seceded after the 1860 presidential election, eventually forming the Confederate States of America. Several federal legislative measures, including the Corwin Amendment, were proposed during this period in the hope of either reconciling the sections of the United States or avoiding the secession of the border states. Senator William H. Seward and Representative Thomas Corwin, Republicans and allies of President-elect Abraham Lincoln, introduced the Corwin Amendment, which was endorsed by the outgoing president, James Buchanan, as well as by Lincoln himself in his first inaugural address in 1861. 
Because it was only ratified in a handful of Northern states and Kentucky, the Corwin Amendment failed to achieve its goal of preventing civil war and preserving the Union. Ultimately, it fell out of favor during the Civil War.

==Text==

The text refers to slavery with terms such as &quot;domestic institutions&quot; and &quot;persons held to labor or service&quot; and avoids using the word &quot;slavery&quot;, following the example set at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which referred to slavery in its draft of the Constitution with comparable descriptions of legal status: &quot;Person held to Service&quot;, &quot;the whole Number of free Persons ..., three fifths of all other Persons&quot;, &quot;The Migration and Importation of such Persons&quot;.

==Legislative history==

In December 1860, when the second session of the 36th Congress was convened, the deepening rift between slave states and free states was erupting into a secession crisis. The Senate quickly formed a &quot;Committee of Thirteen&quot; to investigate possible legislative measures that might solve the slavery predicament. The House formed a &quot;Committee of Thirty-three&quot; with the same objective. More than 200 resolutions with respect to slavery, including 57 resolutions proposing constitutional amendments, were introduced in Congress. Most represented compromises designed to avert military conflict. Senator Jefferson Davis proposed one that explicitly protected property rights in slaves. A group of House members proposed a national convention to accomplish secession as a &quot;dignified, peaceful, and fair separation&quot; that could settle questions like the equitable distribution of the federal government&#x27;s assets and rights to navigate the Mississippi River. Senator John J. Crittenden proposed a compromise consisting of six constitutional amendments and four Congressional resolutions, which were ultimately tabled on December 31.

On January 14, 1861, the House committee submitted a plan calling for an amendment to protect slavery, enforce fugitive slave laws, and repeal state personal liberty laws. The proposed constitutional amendment declared:

While the House debated the measure over the ensuing weeks, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas had joined South Carolina in seceding from the Union. The contentious atmosphere in the House during the debate was relieved by abolitionist Republican Owen Lovejoy of Illinois, who questioned the amendment&#x27;s reach: &quot;Does that include polygamy, the other twin relic of barbarism?&quot; Missouri Democrat John S. Phelps answered: &quot;Does the gentleman desire to know whether he shall be prohibited from committing that crime?&quot;

On February 26, Congressman Thomas Corwin, who had chaired the earlier House committee, introduced his own text as a substitute, but it was not adopted. The following day, after a series of preliminary votes, the House voted 123 to 71 in favor of the original resolution, but as this was below the required two-thirds majority, the measure was not passed. On February 28, however, the House returned to and approved Corwin&#x27;s version—House (Joint) Resolution No. 80—by a vote of 133 to 65, just barely above the two-thirds threshold.

The Senate took up the proposed amendment on March 2, 1861, debating its merits without a recess through the pre-dawn hours on March 4. When the final vote was taken, the amendment passed with exactly the needed two-thirds majority24–12.

Soon afterward, it was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. The joint resolution containing the Corwin Amendment called for the amendment to be submitted to the state legislatures, as it was believed that the amendment had a greater chance of success in the legislatures of the Southern states than would have been the case in state ratifying conventions, given that state conventions were being conducted at that time throughout the South at which votes to secede from the Union were successful.

The Corwin Amendment was the second proposed &quot;Thirteenth Amendment&quot; submitted to the states by Congress. The first was the similarly ill-fated Titles of Nobility Amendment in 1810.

==Presidential responses==
Outgoing President James Buchanan endorsed the Corwin Amendment by taking the unprecedented step of signing it. His signature on the Congressional joint resolution was unnecessary, as the President has no formal role in the constitutional amendment process.

Abraham Lincoln, in his first inaugural address on March 4, said of the Corwin Amendment:

Just weeks prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, Lincoln sent a letter to each state&#x27;s governor transmitting the proposed amendment, noting that Buchanan had approved it. His letter did not say anything opposing or supporting the amendment itself.

==Ratification history==
The Corwin Amendment has been ratified by:

# Kentucky: April 4, 1861
# Ohio: May 13, 1861 (rescinded ratification – March 31, 1864)
# Rhode Island: May 31, 1861
# Maryland: January 10, 1862 (rescinded ratification – April 7, 2014)
# Illinois: June 2, 1863 (rescinded ratification – April 4, 2022)

On February 14, 1862, prior to the 1863 ratification of the amendment by the Illinois General Assembly, an Illinois state constitutional convention purported to ratify the Corwin Amendment. However, since Illinois state lawmakers were sitting as delegates to a convention at the time—and not meeting as the actual state legislature—that action was of questionable validity.

The Restored Government of Virginia, consisting mostly of representatives of what would become West Virginia, voted to approve the amendment on February 13, 1862. However, West Virginia did not ratify the amendment after it became a state in 1863.

In 1963, more than a century after the Corwin Amendment was submitted to the state legislatures by Congress, a joint resolution to ratify it was introduced in the Texas House of Representatives by Dallas Republican Henry Stollenwerck. His reason for doing so was likely related to protecting other &#x27;domestic institutions&#x27;, as he stated his opposition to slavery. His joint resolution was referred to the House&#x27;s Committee on Constitutional Amendments on March 7, 1963, but received no further consideration.

==Attempted withdrawal of amendment==

On February 8, 1864, during the 38th Congress, with the prospects for a Union victory improving, Republican Senator Henry B. Anthony of Rhode Island introduced Senate (Joint) Resolution No. 25 to withdraw the Corwin Amendment from further consideration by the state legislatures and to halt the ratification process. That same day, Anthony&#x27;s joint resolution was referred to the Senate&#x27;s Committee on the Judiciary. On May 11, 1864, Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, received the Senate&#x27;s permission to discharge Senate (Joint) Resolution No. 25 from the committee, but no further action was taken on Anthony&#x27;s joint resolution.

==Debates over hypothetical impact==
The Corwin Amendment never became law. But if it had done so, then, under the plain meaning rule, it would have made slavery immune to the constitutional amendment procedures and to interference by Congress. As a result, the later Reconstruction Amendments (Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth) would not have been permissible, as they abolish or interfere with the domestic institution of the states.

A competing theory, however, suggests that only the entrenched clauses of the original constitution (of which the only one still active is the clause protecting the states&#x27; equal voting power in the Senate) can be protected from subsequent amendments under the established amending formula. Under this theory, a later amendment conflicting with an already-ratified Corwin Amendment could either explicitly repeal the Corwin Amendment (as the Twenty-first Amendment explicitly repealed the Eighteenth Amendment) or be inferred to have either superseded or partially or completely repealed any conflicting provisions of an already-adopted Corwin Amendment.

<text>Wetwang is a Yorkshire Wolds village and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, west of Driffield on the A166 road.

At the 2011 census, it had a population of 761, an increase on the 2001 census figure of 672.
==Name==
There are two interpretations of the name. One is from the Old Norse &quot;vaett-vangr&quot;, or &#x27;field for the trial of a legal action&#x27;. Another theory is that it was the &quot;Wet Field&quot; compared to the nearby dry field at Driffield. 

The name is jokingly defined in &quot;The Meaning of Liff&quot; by Douglas Adams as meaning &quot;a moist penis&quot;. In some varieties of English, &quot;wang&quot; or &quot;whang&quot; is a slang term for penis. The name Wetwang has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

==History==
The village is known for its Iron Age chariot burial cemetery at Wetwang Slack, and it has been speculated that the unlocated Romano-British town of Delgovicia may have been at what is now Wetwang.

Before the Norman Conquest (TRE) Ealdraed held Wetwang, and it was worth £4 per year in rent.
The village is mentioned twice in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wetuuangha&quot;. The lesser mention simply records its existence: &quot;In Wetwang the archbishop carucates&quot;. The mention is under &quot;Warter Hundred&quot; on original folio 381V: East Riding. Earlier in the Domesday Book, there is a fuller description (Folio 302V: Yorkshire) within the listing of the land of the Archbishop of York: A carucate is the area of land a man with 8 oxen can plough in a season, sometimes cited as around . In Wetwang there were of them available for the tax take (&quot;geld&quot;). A &quot;plough&quot; was a carucate which was being ploughed, rather than grazed or fallow. A league is around . After the conquest, Wetwang was waste land held by Archbishop Thomas. 

St Nicholas&#x27;s Church is of Norman origin and was restored between 1845 and 1902. In 1966, the church was designated a Grade II* listed building. It is on the Sykes Churches Trail devised by the East Yorkshire Churches Group. The church has a ring of three bells (tenor in A), the oldest of which (the tenor) dates from .

Wetwang was once known for its black swans, after which the village pub, the Black Swan, is named.

==Public transport==
Until 1950, the village was served by Wetwang railway station, on the Malton to Driffield Line, but this line has closed. The village is now served by an infrequent East Yorkshire Motor Services bus.

==Honorary mayor==

Richard Whiteley of the Channel 4 quiz show &quot;Countdown&quot; held the honorary title &quot;Mayor of Wetwang&quot; from 1998 until his death in 2005.
On 25 June 2006, local weather forecaster Paul Hudson from BBC Look North was invested as Whiteley&#x27;s successor.

<doc id="547681" wikidata="Q426560" url="?curid=547681" title="Ribosomal DNA">
<text>The ribosomal DNA (abbreviated rDNA) consists of a group of ribosomal RNA encoding genes and related regulatory elements, and is widespread in similar configuration in all domains of life. The ribosomal DNA encodes the non-coding ribosomal RNA, integral structural elements in the assembly of ribosomes, its importance making it the most abundant section of RNA found in cells of eukaryotes. Additionally, these segments includes regulatory sections, such as a promotor specific to the RNA polymerase I, as well as both transcribed and non-transcribed spacer segments.

Due to their high importance in the assembly of ribosomes for protein biosynthesis, the rDNA genes are generally highly conserved in molecular evolution. The number of copies can vary considerably per species. Ribosomal DNA is widely used for phylogenetic studies.

== Structure ==
The ribosomal DNA includes all genes coding for the non-coding structural ribosomal RNA molecules. Across all domains of life, these are the structural sequences of the small subunit (16S or 18S rRNA) and the large subunit (23S or 28S rRNA). The assembly of the latter also include the 5S rRNA as well as the additional 5.8S rRNA in eukaryotes.

The rDNA-genes are commonly present with multiple copies in the genome, where they are organized in linked groups in most species, separated by an internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and preceded by the External transcribed spacer (ETS). The 5S rRNA is also linked to these rDNA region in prokaryotes, while it is located in separate repeating regions in most eukaryotes. They are transcribed together to a precursor RNA which is then processed to equal amounts of each rRNA.

=== Prokaryotes ===
The primary structural rRNA molecules in Bacteria and Archaea are smaller than their counterparts in eukaryotes, grouped as 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA. Meanwhile, the 5S rRNA also present in prokaryotes, is of a similar size to eukaryotes.

A notable amount of bacteria and archaea diverge from the canonical structure of the operon containing the rDNA genes, carrying the &quot;unlinked&quot; genes in different places of their genome.

==== Plastids ====
Ribosomal DNA in chloroplasts follows the structure of prokaryotic ribosomal DNA.

=== Eukaryotes ===

The rDNA gene cluster of eukaryotes consists of the genes for the 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNA, separated by the two ITS-1 and ITS-2 spacers. The active genome of eukaryotes contains several hundred copies of the rDNA transcriptional unit as tandem repeats, they are organized in nucleolus organizer regions (NORs), which in turn can be present at multiple loci in the genome.

Similar to the structure of prokaryotes, the 5S rRNA is appended to the rDNA cluster in the Saccharomycetes (Hemiascomycetes) such as &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. Most eukaryotes however, carry the gene for the 5S rRNA in separate gene repeats at different loci in the genome.

5S rDNA is also present in independent tandem repeats as in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. 
As repetitive DNA regions often undergo recombination events, the rDNA repeats have many regulatory mechanisms that keep the DNA from undergoing mutations, thus keeping the rDNA conserved.

In the nucleus, the nucleolus organizer regions give rise to the nucleolus, where the rDNA regions of the chromosome forms expanded chromosomal loops, accessible for transcription of rRNA. In rDNA, the tandem repeats are mostly found in the nucleolus; but heterochromatic rDNA is found outside of the nucleolus. However, transcriptionally active rDNA resides inside of the nucleolus itself.

====Humans====
The human genome contains a total of 560 copies of the rDNA transcriptional unit, spread across five chromosomes with nucleolus organizer regions. The repeat clusters are located on the acrocentric chromosomes 13 (RNR1), 14 (RNR2), 15 (RNR3), 21 (RNR4) and 22 (RNR5).

====Ciliates====
In ciliates, the presence of a generative micronucleus next to the vegetative macronucleus allows for the reduction of rDNA genes in the germline. The exact number of copies in the micronucleus core genome ranging from several copies in &quot;Paramecium&quot; as low as a single copy in &quot;Tetrahymena thermophila&quot; and other &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; species. During macronucleus formation, the regions containing the rDNA gene clusters are amplified, dramatically increasing the amount of available templates for transcription up to several thousand copies. In some ciliate genera, such as &quot;Tetrahymena&quot; or the Hypotrich genus &quot;Oxytricha&quot;, extensive fragmentation of the amplified DNA leads to the formation of microchromosomes, centered on the rDNA transcriptional unit. Similar processes are reported from &quot;Glaucoma chattoni&quot; and to lesser extent from &quot;Paramecium&quot;.

== Sequence homogeneity ==

In the large rDNA array, polymorphisms between rDNA repeat units are very low, indicating that rDNA tandem arrays are evolving through concerted evolution. However, the mechanism of concerted evolution is imperfect, such that polymorphisms between repeats within an individual can occur at significant levels and may confound phylogenetic analyses for closely related organisms.

5S tandem repeat sequences in several &quot;Drosophila&quot; were compared with each other; the result revealed that insertions and deletions occurred frequently between species and often flanked by conserved sequences. They could occur by slippage of the newly synthesized strand during DNA replication or by gene conversion.

== Sequence divergence ==
The rDNA transcription tracts have low rate of polymorphism among species, which allows interspecific comparison to elucidate phylogenetic relationship using only a few specimens. Coding regions of rDNA are highly conserved among species but ITS regions are variable due to insertions, deletions, and point mutations. Between remote species as human and frog comparison of sequences at ITS tracts is not appropriate. Conserved sequences at coding regions of rDNA allow comparisons of remote species, even between yeast and human. Human 5.8S rRNA has 75% identity with yeast 5.8S rRNA.
In cases for sibling species, comparison of the rDNA segment including ITS tracts among species and phylogenetic analysis are made satisfactorily.
The different coding regions of the rDNA repeats usually show distinct evolutionary rates. As a result, this DNA can provide phylogenetic information of species belonging to wide systematic levels.

== Recombination-stimulating activity ==

A fragment of yeast rDNA containing the 5S gene, non-transcribed spacer DNA, and part of the 35S gene has localized cis-acting mitotic recombination stimulating activity. This DNA fragment contains a mitotic recombination hotspot, referred to as HOT1. HOT1 expresses recombination-stimulating activity when it is inserted into novel locations in the yeast genome. HOT1 includes an RNA polymerase I (PolI) transcription promoter that catalyzes 35S ribosomal rRNA gene transcription. In a PolI defective mutant, the HOT1 hotspot recombination-stimulating activity is abolished. The level of PolI transcription in HOT1 appears to determine the level of recombination.

== Clinical significance ==
Diseases can be associated with DNA mutations where DNA can be expanded, such as Huntington&#x27;s disease, or lost due to deletion mutations. The same is true for mutations that occur in rDNA repeats; it has been found that if the genes that are associated with the synthesis of ribosomes are disrupted or mutated, it can result in various diseases associated with the skeleton or bone marrow. Also, any damage or disruption to the enzymes that protect the tandem repeats of the rDNA, can result in lower synthesis of ribosomes, which also lead to other defects in the cell. Neurological diseases can also arise from mutations in the rDNA tandem repeats, such as Bloom syndrome, which occurs when the number of tandem repeats increases close to a hundred-fold; compared with that of the normal number of tandem repeats. Various types of cancers can also be born from mutations of the tandem repeats in the ribosomal DNA. Cell lines can become malignant from either a rearrangement of the tandem repeats, or an expansion of the repeats in the rDNA.

<text>Otto Toeplitz (1 August 1881 – 15 February 1940) was a German mathematician working in functional analysis.

== Life and work ==
Toeplitz was born to a Jewish family of mathematicians. Both his father and grandfather were &quot;Gymnasium&quot; mathematics teachers and published papers in mathematics. Toeplitz grew up in Breslau and graduated from the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; there. He then studied mathematics at the University of Breslau and was awarded a doctorate in algebraic geometry in 1905. In 1906 Toeplitz arrived at Göttingen University, which was then the world&#x27;s leading mathematical center, and he remained there for seven years. The mathematics faculty included David Hilbert, Felix Klein, and Hermann Minkowski. Toeplitz joined a group of young people working with Hilbert: Max Born, Richard Courant and Ernst Hellinger, with whom he collaborated for many years afterward. At that time Toeplitz began to rework the theory of linear functionals and quadratic forms on &quot;n&quot;-dimensional spaces for infinite dimensional spaces. He wrote five papers directly related to spectral theory of operators which Hilbert was developing. During this period he also published a paper on summation processes and discovered the basic ideas of what are now called the Toeplitz operators. In 1913 Toeplitz became an extraordinary professor at the University of Kiel. He was promoted to a professor in 1920.

In 1911, Toeplitz proposed the inscribed square problem:

: &quot;Does every Jordan curve contain an inscribed square?&quot;

This has been established for convex curves and smooth curves, but the question remains open in general (2007).

Together with Hans Rademacher, he wrote a classic of popular mathematics &quot;Von Zahlen und Figuren&quot;, which was first published in 1930 and later translated into English as &quot;Enjoyment of Mathematics&quot;.

Toeplitz was deeply interested in the history of mathematics. In 1929, he cofounded &quot;Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte der Mathematik&quot; with Otto Neugebauer and Julius Stenzel. Beginning in the 1920s, Toeplitz advocated a &quot;genetic method&quot; in teaching of mathematics, which he applied in writing the book &quot;Entwicklung der Infinitesimalrechnung&quot; (&quot;The Calculus: A Genetic Approach&quot;). The book introduces the subject by giving an idealized historical narrative to motivate the concepts, showing how they developed from classical problems of Greek mathematics. It was left unfinished, edited by Gottfried Köthe and posthumously published in German in 1946 (English translation: 1963).

In 1928 Toeplitz succeeded Eduard Study at Bonn University. In 1933, the Civil Service Law came into effect and professors of Jewish origin were removed from teaching. Initially, Toeplitz was able to retain his position due to an exception for those who had been appointed before 1914, but he was nonetheless dismissed in 1935. In 1939 he emigrated to Mandatory Palestine, where he was scientific advisor to the rector of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He died in Jerusalem from tuberculosis a year later.

<text>Henry Joseph Clarke (July 7, 1833 – September 13, 1889), who sometimes used the middle names Hynes and O&#x27;Connell, was a lawyer and politician in Manitoba, Canada.

Born in Donegal (now in the Republic of Ireland) on July 7, 1833, Clarke moved with his family to Canada at age three. He practiced law in Montreal, Lower Canada, before moving to California during the &quot;gold rush&quot; of 1858, and also lived in El Salvador for a period in the early 1860s. He returned to Montreal after this time, and developed a strong reputation as a criminal lawyer.

Clarke ran for Province of Canada&#x27;s parliament as a Liberal-Conservative in the 1863 election, losing to Liberal finance minister Luther Hamilton Holton in the riding of Chateauguay. In 1867, he wrote a short biography of fellow Irish Catholic politician Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee.

On the advice of George-Étienne Cartier and Bishop Alexandre-Antonin Taché, Clarke moved to Manitoba in 1870 to assist in the establishment of a provincial government. He was elected by acclamation for the constituency of St. Charles in Manitoba&#x27;s first general election, held on December 27, 1870. He was then appointed as the province&#x27;s first Attorney General on January 3, 1871. In this capacity, he took a leading role in establishing the province&#x27;s legal system.

Clarke had a poor personal relationship with Lt. Governor Adams George Archibald (1870–1872), who considered him intemperate and unduly ambitious. There were serious policy disagreements between Clarke and the Lieutenant Governors, most notably over the makeup of Manitoba&#x27;s supreme court: Clarke wanted three justices to serve on the court, while Archibald preferred only a single justice. This division became a serious dispute in the province, largely due to Clarke&#x27;s refusal to accept a compromise. Federal prime minister John A. Macdonald eventually intervened, and established a court with a single justice.

Clarke also wanted departmental control over the number of lawyers in Manitoba. In 1871, he navigated a bill through the assembly which would have restricted the number of out-of-province lawyers to ten, and given the Attorney General&#x27;s office final authority over who could practice. This measure was opposed by Archibald, and was overridden by the federal government.

Clarke was a political spokesman for those members of Manitoba&#x27;s Métis community who opposed the leadership of Louis Riel. As such, he was opposed by both &quot;ultra-loyalists&quot; among the English and by Riel&#x27;s more numerous supporters among the Métis, and frequently clashed with fellow cabinet member Joseph Royal, a political spokesman for the latter group. When three Métis were arrested on charges of treason following Fenian raids in 1871, Clarke personally led the prosecution while Royal acted at the chief defense lawyer. Two of the defendants were acquitted, and one was convicted.

In the Canadian general election of 1872, Clarke stood as a candidate against Riel in the riding of Provencher. However, both candidates resigned to allow the acclamation of George-Étienne Cartier following the latter&#x27;s defeat in Montreal.

Clarke was a provincial representative to Ottawa in 1871 and 1873, for meetings on immigration and &quot;better terms&quot; for the province.

In 1873, Clarke publicly defended Lord Gordon Gordon, an English trader and con-man who claimed to be a Scottish lord, and made a fortune in investment fraud. The revelation of Gordon&#x27;s true identity was an embarrassment for Clarke.

The ministry which included Clarke was defeated in the legislature in July 1874, when John Norquay&#x27;s bill for electoral redistribution was defeated. Clarke resigned as Attorney General, and returned to California. While stopping over in Minnesota, he was beset upon by a group of investors who ran been defrauded by Gordon Gordon, and was seriously injured.

He returned to Winnipeg in 1877, and ran unsuccessfully for the constituency of Rockwood in the provincial elections of 1878 and 1879. Previously a supporter of French language rights, Clarke was by this time campaigning against bilingualism and state funding for Catholic schools. Despite this, he later defended twenty-five followers of Louis Riel in court, after the second Riel Rebellion of 1885. Clarke died near Medicine Hat in 1889, while travelling by train.

Clarke is sometimes listed as the third Premier of Manitoba, but this is inaccurate. Like his &quot;predecessors&quot; Alfred Boyd and Marc-Amable Girard, Clarke was simply a leading minister in a cabinet controlled by the province&#x27;s Lieutenant Governors. Morris, in fact, rejected Clarke&#x27;s request to be recognized as Premier in 1873. Some modern sources list Clarke as having been the &quot;Chief Minister&quot; of Manitoba from 1872 to 1874, but he was not described by this title at the time; the term appears to be a more recent invention. Clarke was, however, acknowledged as the government leader in the legislature from 1871 to 1874.

<doc id="547687" wikidata="Q1548954" url="?curid=547687" title="They Were Expendable">
<text>They Were Expendable is a 1945 American war film directed by John Ford, starring Robert Montgomery and John Wayne, and featuring Donna Reed. The film is based on the 1942 novel of the same name by William Lindsay White, relating the story of the exploits of Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, a United States PT boat unit defending the Philippines against Japanese invasion during the Battle of the Philippines (1941–42) in World War II.

While a work of fiction, the book was based on actual events and people. The characters John Brickley (Montgomery) and Rusty Ryan (Wayne) are fictionalizations of PT-Boat Squadron Three Commander John D. Bulkeley, a Medal of Honor recipient, and his executive officer Robert Kelly, respectively. Both the film and the book, which was a best-seller and excerpted in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;, depict certain combat-related events that were believed to have occurred during the war, alongside those which did not; nonetheless, the film is noted for its relatively accurate and detailed depiction of naval combat for the era in which it was made.

== Plot ==

In December 1941, Lt. John &quot;Brick&quot; Brickley (Robert Montgomery) commands a squadron of agile but small and unproven U.S. Navy PT boats based at Cavite in the Philippines. He puts on a demonstration of their maneuverability and seakeeping capabilities for the senior area commander, Admiral Blackwell (Charles Trowbridge), who remains unimpressed by their diminutive size and lightweight construction. Lt. J. G. &quot;Rusty&quot; Ryan (John Wayne), Brick&#x27;s immature executive officer, is hot on getting into combat. He becomes disgusted at the admiral&#x27;s close-minded dismissal and is writing his request for transfer to destroyer duty when news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor arrives by radio bulletin.

Japanese forces descend on the Philippines and wreak havoc. Bypassed by local brass, Brick&#x27;s squadron is kept out of combat and marginalized to menial mail and messenger duty. Frustration, particularly with Rusty, grows and threatens to boil over. Following a devastating attack on their base, the desperate admiral relents and orders them to attack a large Japanese cruiser shelling U.S. troop emplacements ashore. After initially choosing Rusty to skipper the second boat on the sortie, Brick discovers that his exec has blood poisoning from a previous combat wound and orders him to sick bay, selecting another boat and crew to take his place. 

After accusing his CO of glory hogging and resisting evacuation to a military hospital on Corregidor, Rusty arrives there still hissing and spitting, only to reluctantly admit to the severity of his life-threatening condition. There he meets another patient, &quot;Ohio&quot; (Louis Jean Heydt), who chides him to cool off and get in line. Once he does, Rusty begins a romance with strong-willed Army nurse Sandy Davyss (Donna Reed), so attractive, kind, and wholesomely appealing Ohio cracks, &quot;Eleven-thousand men can&#x27;t be wrong&quot; about her.

Brick&#x27;s attack sinks the cruiser. Rusty returns and the squadron is unleashed, achieving increasing success, though at the cost both of boats and men. Still, it is only a matter of time before the Philippines fall. Sandy attends a dinner in her honor at the PT Base, reigniting the flame between her and Rusty.

The squadron is marooned on the Philippine Island of Corregidor in Manila Bay, just Southeast of the large Northern-most Philippine Island of Luzon after the Japanese onslaught against the doomed American defenders at the Bataan. Corregidor stands as the last American stronghold against the advancing Japanese invaders. The PT Squadron are then assigned to evacuate the commanding general of the Pacific Theatre, Douglas MacArthur, his entourage, and Admiral Blackwell to the Southern-most Philippine island of Mindanao, where they will be flown South to Australia. Rusty manages to make a last phone call to Sandy, now on Bataan, to explain he has been ordered out, but before they can say goodbye the connection is cut off. 

The small PT flotilla successfully carries the commanders across spans of open ocean to their rendezvous. It then resumes its attacks against the Japanese, who gradually whittle the squadron down until it is too small to function effectively. Crews without boats are sent to link up with the Army and fight as infantry. After Rusty&#x27;s boat is damaged, the last two PTs pull into a small shipyard run by crusty &quot;Dad&quot; Knowland (Russell Simpson) for repairs. As the boats leave in haste ahead of an imminent Japanese assault, Dad refuses to flee, bidding his poignant farewell with a rifle folded in his arms and a whisky jug tucked securely at his feet. 

In a final assault that destroys another threatening cruiser, Rusty&#x27;s boat is sunk, after which Brick&#x27;s is turned over to the US Army, once again reduced to messenger duty. Brick, Ryan and two ensigns are ordered by Navy command to be airlifted out on the last plane, assigned stateside to train PT crews, the small, inexpensive wood-hulled boats having proved their worth in combat. While waiting for the plane, Rusty runs into Ohio. Neither knows what happened to Sandy, trapped behind on Bataan. Each helps the other to hope she escaped to the hills rather than meet her likely dark fate. When the ensigns finally arrive late, Rusty bolts for the aircraft&#x27;s exit, but is brought to heel by Brickley, who reminds him his duty comes first. Ohio is forced to give up his seat on the plane and is left behind to face certain death or capture.

The surviving enlisted men, led by Chief Mulcahey (Ward Bond), shoulder rifles and march off to continue the resistance with the remnants of the U.S. Army and Filipino guerrillas, as expendable in the fight as their PT boats had been before them.

== Production ==
Following the acquisition of the film rights to White&#x27;s &quot;They Were Expendable,&quot; MGM asked Ford to direct a film based on the book; Ford repeatedly refused due to his conflicting service in the Navy Field Photographic Unit. While he was serving in the Photographic Unit, Ford met Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley during the preparation of the Normandy Invasion and later signed Bulkeley&#x27;s D-Day executive officer Robert Montgomery.

According to Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz, Ford, a notoriously tough taskmaster who had received a commission as a commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve in his late 40s during WWII, was especially hard on Wayne, who had a 3-A — family deferment — draft rating. During production, Ford fell from scaffolding and broke his leg. He turned to Montgomery, who had actually commanded a PT boat, to temporarily take over for him as director. Montgomery did so well that within a few years he made the transition from actor to directing films.

The film, which received extensive support from the Navy Department, was shot in Key Biscayne, Florida and the Florida Keys. This region of sandy islands and palm trees around 25° North latitude sufficiently approximated the Philippines between approximately 10° and 15° North where the film&#x27;s action took place in the South West Pacific Theater of World War II. Two actual U.S. Navy 80-foot Elco PT boats (hull numbers PT-139 and 141), and four 78-foot Higgins PT boats, (hull numbers PT-98, 100, 101, 102), were used throughout filming, given hull numbers in use in late 1941 and early 1942 for the film. Additional U.S. aircraft from nearby naval air stations in Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Key West were temporarily re-marked and used to simulate Japanese aircraft in the film.

Ford&#x27;s onscreen directing credit reads, &quot;Directed by John Ford, Captain U.S.N.R.&quot;; Frank Wead&#x27;s onscreen credit reads: &quot;Screenplay by Frank Wead Comdr. U.S.N., Ret&quot;; Montgomery&#x27;s onscreen credit reads: &quot;Robert Montgomery Comdr. U.S.N.R.&quot;

===Depiction of PT boats&#x27; effectiveness===
The movie likely exaggerated the actual effectiveness of the PT boats in the war, and in at least one instance loosely referenced Commander Bulkeley&#x27;s own exaggerated statements. Lt. Brickley, the character most closely based on the real Commander John Bulkeley, declares at one point in the movie that PT Boats had &quot;sunk two converted cruisers, an auxiliary aircraft carrier, a 10,000-ton tanker, a large freighter, a flock of barges and numerous sons of Nippon!&quot; This statement is very similar to a claim made by the real Commander Bulkeley himself during the war that &quot;Our little half squadron sank one Jap cruiser, one plane tender, and one loaded transport, badly damaged another cruiser, set a tanker on fire and shot down four planes&quot;. According to William Doyle, the author of &quot;PT 109: An American Epic of War, Survival, and the Destiny of John F. Kennedy&quot;, &quot;after the war, when Japanese Naval loss records were examined by U. S. Naval Intelligence experts, it was learned that these claims were inaccurate and exaggerated&quot;. Contemporary historians of President John F. Kennedy, William Doyle, and Fredrik Logevall noted that one of the primary problems of the PT boats were the accuracy and relatively slow speed of their Mark 8 torpedoes. Added to the problem of inaccuracy at reaching target, as many as 50% failed to explode on contact with enemy ships due to faulty calibration by the Navy in the early years of the war.

===Reception===
The movie was popular, earning $3,109,000 domestically and $1,238,000 foreign, but because of its high cost, recorded a loss of $101,000.

==Awards and honors==
Douglas Shearer was nominated for the Oscar for Best Sound Recording, while A. Arnold Gillespie, Donald Jahraus, R. A. MacDonald and Michael Steinore were nominated for Best Effects. It was also named in the &quot;10 Best Films of 1945&quot; list by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In his &quot;Movie and Video Guide&quot;, film critic and historian Leonard Maltin awarded &quot;They Were Expendable&quot; a four-star rating, describing it as a &quot;moving, exquisitely detailed production&quot; that is &quot;one of the finest (and most underrated) of all WW2 films.&quot;

<text>Chthonian planets (, sometimes &#x27;cthonian&#x27;) are a hypothetical class of celestial objects resulting from the stripping away of a gas giant&#x27;s hydrogen and helium atmosphere and outer layers, which is called hydrodynamic escape. Such atmospheric stripping is a likely result of proximity to a star. The remaining rocky or metallic core would resemble a terrestrial planet in many respects.

==Etymology==

&quot;Chthon&quot; (from ) means &quot;earth&quot;. The term &quot;chthonian&quot; was coined by Hébrard et al. and generally refers to Greek chthonic deities from the infernal underground.

==Possible examples==

Transit-timing variation measurements indicate, for example, that Kepler-52b, Kepler-52c and Kepler-57b have maximum masses between 30 and 100 times the mass of Earth (although the actual masses could be much lower); with radii about two Earth radii, they might have densities larger than that of an iron planet of the same size. These exoplanets orbit very close to their stars and could be the remnant cores of evaporated gas giants or brown dwarfs. If cores are massive enough they could remain compressed for billions of years despite losing the atmospheric mass.

As there is a lack of gaseous &quot;hot-super-Earths&quot; between 2.2 and 3.8 Earth-radii exposed to over 650 Earth incident flux, it is assumed that exoplanets below such radii exposed to such stellar fluxes could have had their envelopes stripped by photoevaporation.
=== HD 209458 b ===
HD 209458 b is an example of a gas giant that is in the process of having its atmosphere stripped away, though it will not become a chthonian planet for many billions of years, if ever. A similar case would be Gliese 436b, which has already lost 10% of its atmosphere.

=== CoRoT-7b ===
CoRoT-7b is the first exoplanet found that might be chthonian.
Other researchers dispute this, and conclude CoRoT-7b was always a rocky planet and not the eroded core of a gas or ice giant, due to the young age of the star system. 
=== TOI-849 b ===
In 2020, a high-density planet more massive than Neptune was found very close to its host star, within the Neptunian desert. This world, TOI-849 b, may very well be a chthonian planet.

<doc id="547699" wikidata="Q2048880" url="?curid=547699" title="Nicholas Gilman">
<text>Nicholas Gilman Jr. (August 3, 1755May 2, 1814) was an American Founding Father, a soldier in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, a delegate to the Continental Congress, and a signer of the U.S. Constitution, representing New Hampshire. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives during the first four Congresses and served in the U.S. Senate from 1805 until his death in 1814. His brother John Taylor Gilman was also very active in New Hampshire politics, serving as Governor of New Hampshire for 14 years, as well as a principal benefactor of Phillips Exeter Academy. Their childhood home in Exeter is now the American Independence Museum.

==Family background and early life==

Gilman was born in Exeter, Province of New Hampshire, to Ann (Taylor) and Nicholas Gilman, the second son in a family of six children. Gilman had four brothers and one sister who were named (from oldest to youngest) John, Nicholas, Nathaniel, Elizabeth, Samuel, and Daniel. He also had two brothers who died before a year of age. Born during the French and Indian War, he was soon aware of the military responsibilities that went with citizenship in a New England colony. After attending local public schools, he became a clerk in his father&#x27;s trading house, but the growing rift between the colonies and Great Britain quickly thrust Gilman into the struggle for independence. New England merchants, in particular, resented Parliament&#x27;s attempt to end its &quot;salutary neglect&quot; of the financial and political affairs of the colonies by instituting measures to raise and to enforce the raising of revenue measures that many Americans considered violations of their rights as British citizens. Gilman&#x27;s father, along with Nathaniel Folsom and Enoch Poor, emerged as a leader of the Patriot cause in Exeter.

He represented his community in the New Hampshire Provincial Congresses, which met just after hostilities broke out at Lexington and Concord in 1775 and which later drafted the state constitution. During the American Revolution he served as the state&#x27;s treasurer. His oldest brother, John, was a sergeant in Exeter&#x27;s company of militia that marched to fight the Redcoats around Boston. Nicholas remained behind but was an ardent supporter of the Patriot cause, and he likely trained with the local militia regiment.

==Revolutionary War==

In November 1776, a committee of the state legislature appointed Gilman to serve as adjutant, or administrative officer, of the 3rd New Hampshire Regiment. That unit was in the process of a complete reorganization under the direction of its commander, Colonel Alexander Scammell. A superb combat officer, Scammell made good use of Gilman&#x27;s administrative talents in the task of creating a potent fighting force out of the limited manpower resources at hand––a combination of raw recruits from around the state and ragged veterans of the Trenton-Princeton campaign. In time the 3rd New Hampshire would be recognized as one of the mainstays of General George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army.

Because New Hampshire lay along the major invasion route from Canada to New York, Washington assigned its regiments a key role in the strategic defense of the northern states. In the spring of 1777 Gilman and the rest of the officers and men of the 3rd New Hampshire marched to Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain to participate in an attempt by American forces to halt the advance of a powerful army of British and German regulars and Indian auxiliaries under General John Burgoyne. Difficulties in coordinating the efforts of several different states turned Gilman&#x27;s first military experience into one of defeat. The veteran British troops outflanked the fort, and only at the last minute did the garrison, including the 3d New Hampshire, escape capture by making a dangerous night.
The American retreat lasted through the early summer until a combination of British transportation difficulties and delaying tactics employed by the Continentals finally slowed the enemy advance. This delay allowed time for a mass mobilization of New England militia, including a New Hampshire Regiment of volunteers led by John Langdon and Gilman&#x27;s father. It also provided Major General Horatio Gates with time to establish new positions near Saratoga, New York, to block Burgoyne&#x27;s further advance, and then, once Gates had a numerical advantage, to cut off the British line of withdrawal to Canada. During this campaign, Gilman was busily employed in supervising the training and readiness of Scammell&#x27;s men. He participated with his unit in two important battles at Freeman&#x27;s Farm, where Burgoyne&#x27;s units were so pummeled that Burgoyne was eventually forced to surrender his whole army.

Neither Gilman nor Scammell was granted a respite after this great victory. Less than a week after the British surrender, the 3rd New Hampshire set out to reinforce Washington&#x27;s main army near Philadelphia. The American capital had recently fallen to a larger British force, and the New Englanders had to spend a harsh winter in the snows of Valley Forge. That winter encampment put the units of the Continental Army to their supreme test, a time of suffering and deprivation from which they emerged as a tough, professional combat team. Gilman&#x27;s administrative skills came to the fore at this time. When Washington selected Colonel Scammell to serve as the Continental Army&#x27;s Adjutant General, Scammell made Gilman his assistant. Promotion to the rank of captain followed in June 1778.

For the remainder of the war, Gilman found himself in close proximity to the military leaders of the Continental Army. His duties in carrying out the myriad tasks necessary to keep a force in the field placed him in daily contact with Washington, Baron von Steuben, Henry Knox, Nathanael Greene, and others. He personally saw action in the remaining battles fought by Washington&#x27;s main army, including Monmouth and Yorktown, while continuing to hold his captain&#x27;s commission in the New Hampshire Line. The death of Colonel Scammell, however, during the preliminary skirmishing before Yorktown robbed him of much of the joy of that great victory. Following the death of his father in late 1783, he retired from military service and returned to Exeter to assume control of the family&#x27;s business.

==Statesman==

At the close of the Revolution, Gilman was elected one of the 31 original members of the Society of the Cincinnati. Gilman&#x27;s career as merchant proved short-lived. His career as statesman continued for decades. Gilman&#x27;s service as a Continental Army officer had exposed him to many of the ideas of such prominent nationalists as Washington and Alexander Hamilton. Their influence, his family&#x27;s own tradition of service, and his special skill at organization all combined to divert the young veteran into a political career. In 1786, the New Hampshire legislature appointed Gilman to the Continental Congress. He was also selected in 1786 to represent the state at the Annapolis Convention. Although he was unable to attend, his selection recognized Gilman&#x27;s emergence as a nationalist spokesman since the convention had been called specifically to address the country&#x27;s serious economic problems and the inability of the separate states or Congress to solve them.

The outbreak of unrest and latent insurrection in western Massachusetts in late 1786 further strengthened Gilman&#x27;s commitment to changing the Articles of Confederation. That same year, he helped to suppress the Paper Money Riot. He was pleased to serve his state as a representative at the Constitutional Convention that met in July 1787. Although he and fellow New Hampshire delegate John Langdon, his father&#x27;s former commanding officer, reached Philadelphia after the proceedings were well under way, they both immediately joined in the debates and helped hammer out the compromises needed to produce a document that might win approval in every state and region.
During the subsequent struggle to secure New Hampshire&#x27;s ratification of the Constitution, Gilman remained in New York as a member of the Continental Congress, but he kept in close touch with his brother, John, who was one of the leaders of the states ratification forces. Working in tandem, the brothers used all of their considerable political influence to engineer a 57–47 victory in the final vote.

When the First Congress of the new United States of America convened in New York in 1789, Gilman was in attendance as a member of the House of Representatives, a seat he filled for four terms. During this period the Gilman brothers came to prominence in New Hampshire politics. John became governor, a post he held for fourteen terms, while Nicholas embarked on a career in the state legislature. After returning to Exeter, Nicholas resumed his own political career in 1800, serving a term as state senator.

During this time, Gilman&#x27;s political loyalties began to change. Ever a staunch nationalist, he had supported the Federalists while that party led the fight for a more binding union of the states. However, once that concept was firmly established, Gilman became increasingly concerned with the need to protect the common man from abuses of power by government. As a consequence, he gave his support to the Democratic-Republican Party that was beginning to form around Thomas Jefferson. In 1801, he accepted the appointment from Jefferson as a federal bankruptcy commissioner. Following one unsuccessful attempt for the Senate in 1802, he was then elected to the United States Senate in 1804 as a Jeffersonian. On June 17, 1812, he voted against the war against Britain, but the Senate voted 19 to 13 for the war. Although Gillman rarely spoke at length in legislative debate, his peers recognized his political prowess. He remained an influential member of the Senate until his death in 1814 while he was returning home from Washington during a recess.

Gilman summarized his belief in the importance of a strong national government on the day after he signed the Constitution. He called the new supreme law of the land &quot;the best that could meet the unanimous concurrence of the States in Convention; it was done by bargain and Compromise, yet, notwithstanding its imperfections, on the adoption of it depends (in my feeble judgment) whether we shall become a respectable nation, or a people torn to pieces ... and rendered contemptible for ages.&quot; Those words typified Gillman, but his modesty failed to mask the justifiable pride he obviously felt in the accomplishment of the Founding Fathers in which Gilman had played no small part.

<doc id="547707" wikidata="Q621240" url="?curid=547707" title="Apple Filing Protocol">
<text>The Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), formerly AppleTalk Filing Protocol, is a proprietary network protocol, and part of the Apple File Service (AFS), that offers file services for macOS, classic Mac OS, and Apple II computers. In OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion and earlier, AFP was the primary protocol for file services. Starting with OS X 10.9 Mavericks, Server Message Block (SMB) was made the primary file sharing protocol, with the ability to run an AFP server removed later in macOS 11 Big Sur. AFP supports Unicode file names, POSIX and access-control list permissions, resource forks, named extended attributes, and advanced file locking.

==Compatibility==
AFP versions 3.0 and greater rely exclusively on TCP/IP (port 548) for establishing communication, supporting AppleTalk only as a service discovery protocol. The AFP 2.x family supports both TCP/IP (using Data Stream Interface) and AppleTalk for communication and service discovery. Many third-party AFP implementations use AFP 2.x, thereby supporting AppleTalk as a connection method. Still earlier versions rely exclusively on AppleTalk. For this reason, some older literature refers to AFP as &quot;AppleTalk Filing Protocol&quot;. Other literature may refer to AFP as &quot;AppleShare&quot;, the name of the Mac OS 9 (and earlier) AFP client.

Notable current compatibility topics are:
# Mac OS X v10.4 and later eliminates support for AFP servers that rely solely on AppleTalk for communication.
# Computers using classic Mac OS can connect to AFP 3.x servers, with some limitations. For example, the maximum file size in Mac OS 8 is 2 gigabytes. Typically, Mac OS 9.1 or later is recommended for connecting to AFP 3.x servers; for versions of original Mac OS prior to 9.1, installation of the AppleShare client 3.8.8 is required.
# AFP 3.0 and later is required for network home directories, since Mac OS X requires POSIX permissions on user home directories. Single sign-on using Kerberos requires AFP 3.1.
#APFS: AFP is incompatible with sharing of APFS volumes but is still usable as a Time Machine destination in High Sierra.

==History==
Early implementations of AFP server software were available in Mac OS starting with System 6, in AppleShare and AppleShare IP, and in early &quot;1.x&quot; releases of Mac OS X Server. In client operating systems, AFP was called &quot;Personal File Sharing&quot;, and supported up to ten simultaneous connections. These AFP implementations relied on version 1.x or 2.x of the protocol. AppleShare IP 5.x, 6.x, and the &quot;1.x&quot; releases of Mac OS X Server introduced AFP version 2.2. This was the first version to offer transport connections using TCP/IP as well as AppleTalk. It also increased the maximum share point size from four gigabytes to two terabytes, although the maximum file size that could be stored remained at two gigabytes due to limitations in the original Mac OS.

Changes made in AFP since version 3.0 represent major advances in the protocol, introducing features designed specifically for Mac OS X clients. 

However, like the AppleShare client in original Mac OS, the AFP client in Mac OS X continues to support type and creator codes, along with filename extensions.

AFP 3.0 was introduced in Mac OS X Server 10.0.3, and was used through Mac OS X Server 10.1.5. It was the first version to use the UNIX-style POSIX permissions model and Unicode UTF-8 file name encodings. Version 3.0 supported a maximum share point and file size of two terabytes, the maximum file size and volume size for Mac OS X until version 10.2. (Note that the maximum file size changed from version 2.2, described above.) Before AFP 3.0, 31 bytes was the maximum length of a filename sent over AFP.

AFP 3.1 was introduced in Mac OS X Server version 10.2. Notable changes included support for Kerberos authentication, automatic client reconnect, NFS resharing, and secure AFP connections via Secure Shell (SSH). The maximum share point and file size increased to 8 terabytes with Mac OS X Server 10.2, and then to 16 terabytes with Mac OS X Server 10.3.

AFP 3.2 adds support for Access Control Lists and extended attributes in Mac OS X Server 10.4. Maximum share point size is at least 16 terabytes, although Apple has not published a limits document for Mac OS X Server 10.4. Apple implemented AFP 3.2 support in their AirPort Time Capsule wireless router device.

AFP 3.2+ was introduced in Mac OS X Leopard and adds case sensitivity support and improves support for Time Machine (synchronization, lock stealing, and sleep notifications).

AFP 3.3 mandates support for Replay Cache functionality (required for Time Machine).

AFP 3.4, introduced in OS X Mountain Lion, includes a minor change in the mapping of POSIX errors to AFP errors.

See Apple&#x27;s Developer documentation on AFP Version Differences.

==The macOS client==
In Mac OS X Tiger, users can connect to AFP servers by browsing for them in the Network globe or entering an AFP Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into the Connect to Server dialog. In Mac OS X Leopard and later releases, AFP shares are displayed in the Finder sidebar. AFP URLs take the form: &quot;afp:///&quot;, where is the server&#x27;s IP address, Domain Name System (DNS) name, or Bonjour name, and is the name of the share point. In Snow Leopard and later, a URL of the form &quot;afp:////&quot; can be used to mount a subdirectory underneath a share point.

macOS also offers Personal File Sharing, a &quot;light&quot; implementation of the current version of AFP. In Mac OS X 10.4, users can share the contents of their Public folders by checking Personal File Sharing in the Sharing section of System Preferences.

AFP URLs for AppleTalk servers took the form: &quot;afp://at/:&quot;. For networks without AppleTalk zones, an asterisk (*) would be substituted for the zone name.

==Third-party implementations==
Third party server implementations of AFP are available from a number of companies.
*An open source AFP server called Netatalk (AFP 3.4) is available for Unix-like operating systems. A range of NAS solutions integrate Netatalk to enable support for AFP.
*Novell Open Enterprise Server supports AFP.
*Microsoft includes AFP 2.2 server support as an option in some versions of Windows (NT, 2000 &amp; 2003). Windows NT Server (3 and 4) only supported AppleTalk, 2000 added AppleShare over IP; Services for Macintosh (SFM), was removed from Windows Server 2008 onwards.
*Novell&#x27;s NetWare supports AFP.
*HELIOS UB+ supports AFP on a whole array of different Unix based platforms.
*The open source Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) and command-line client implementation afpfs-ng for Linux and Unix-like operating systems
*GroupLogic ExtremeZ-IP (AFP 3.3) and MacServerIP for Windows offer AFP 3.x support - now Acronis Files Connect.
*Adaptec&#x27;s Snap Server is a NAS with a proprietary implementation of AFP 3.1.
*Jaffer is a Java implementation of AFP 3.1.
*Xinet from North Plains Systems offers an AFP platform that can run on most Unix based platforms. One of their products, ka-share, has been a main stay on Solaris SPARC and Silicon Graphics IRIX platforms.
*Columbia AppleTalk Package (CAP) is a historical open source implementation of AFP and AppleTalk from Columbia University that was last updated in 1996.
*supported by GVfs through gfvs-afp-volume-monitor

<doc id="547713" wikidata="Q6244698" url="?curid=547713" title="John Leverett">
<text>John Leverett (baptized 7 July 1616 – 16 March 1678/79) was an English colonial magistrate, merchant, soldier and the penultimate governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Born in England, he migrated to Massachusetts as a teenager. He was a leading merchant in the colony, and served in its military. In the 1640s he went back to England to fight in the English Civil War.

He was opposed to the strict Puritan religious orthodoxy in the colony. He also believed the colonial government was not within the power of the English crown and government, a politically hardline position that contributed to the eventual revocation of the colonial charter in 1684. His business and military activities were sometimes intermingled, leading some in the colony to view him unfavorably. However, he was popular with his troops, and was repeatedly elected governor of the colony from 1673 until his death in 1679. He oversaw the colonial actions in King Philip&#x27;s War, and expanded the colony&#x27;s territories by purchasing land claims in present-day Maine.

==Early life==
John Leverett was baptized 7 July 1616 at St Botolph&#x27;s Church in Boston, Lincolnshire. His father, Thomas Leverett, was a close associate of John Cotton, the church&#x27;s Puritan pastor, and served as one of the church&#x27;s elders. Nothing is known of his mother, Anne Fisher, beyond that she bore her husband 16 children. Of John Leverett&#x27;s youth nothing is known prior to the family&#x27;s departure for the New World in 1633. By the early 1630s Leverett&#x27;s father was an alderman in Boston, and had acquired, in partnership with John Beauchamp of the Plymouth Council for New England, a grant now known as the Waldo Patent for land in what is now the state of Maine. When the family arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony it settled in the capital, also called Boston. Leverett married Hannah Hudson in 1639. They had a son, Hudson, in 1640; Hannah died in 1643. In 1640 Leverett was made a freeman.

In 1639 he joined the Artillery Company of Massachusetts. The Artillery Company was a focal point in the colony for people who disagreed with the orthodoxy of the colony&#x27;s Puritan leaders. Many of its leading members, Leverett among them, opposed the colonial crackdowns on religious dissenters. Its members also engaged in trade. Leverett frequently partnered with Edward Gibbons and Major General Robert Sedgwick in trading ventures. He was, for example, part owner with Gibbons of a ship lost off the Virginia coast. The mixture of military leadership and commercial enterprise sometimes led to conflicts of interest. In the 1640s, Gibbons convinced Governor John Winthrop to allow Massachusetts volunteers to assist French Acadian Governor Charles de la Tour in his dispute with Charles de Menou d&#x27;Aulnay. Gibbons had negotiated exclusive trading privileges with la Tour in exchange for this help, and Leverett was also able to secure preferential trading privileges with the French.

==English Civil War==
In about 1644 Leverett went to England, where he fought in the Parliamentary cause for Oliver Cromwell in the English Civil War. He had a military command in the cavalry of Thomas Rainsborough, where he supposedly served with distinction. He returned home in 1645, but may have gone back to England in the following years. He married Robert Sedgwick&#x27;s daughter Sarah in 1645. The couple had 12 children, of whom only six survived to adulthood.

Leverett&#x27;s time in England brought him to a belief in the need for more religious tolerance. He would pursue the idea politically, often in the face of opposition from the conservative Puritan leadership of Massachusetts that opposed religious views that did not accord with their own. He specifically opposed the Cambridge Platform describing New England church orthodoxy, and opposed punishments of nonconforming individuals when he sat as a deputy in the Massachusetts general court (the colonial legislature). John Winthrop, in writing about the 1648 synod that adopted the platform, noted that those &quot;who came lately from England&quot; were strongly opposed to its resolutions.

==Massachusetts politics==
Leverett became active in local politics after becoming a freeman in 1640. In 1642 Leverett and Edward Hutchinson were sent as diplomatic envoys to negotiate with the Narragansett chief Miantonomoh amid concerns that all of the local Indian tribes were conspiring to wage war on the English colonists. Miantonomoh went to Boston and convinced Governor Winthrop that the rumors they had heard were groundless. Leverett would be called on for diplomatic missions in future administrations as well.

Following his return from England, he resumed his political activities. He was elected as one of Boston&#x27;s two representatives in the colony&#x27;s general court in 1651, and served a brief stint as Speaker of the House. Throughout the 1650s and 1660s he served five terms on the general court.

Leverett was a popular leader of the colonial militia, something that resulted in an unusual situation caused by the colony&#x27;s militia laws. The colony had voted to limit the size of its militia companies, and restricted their officers to hold only one post. In 1652, when Leverett was captain of a Suffolk County company of horse, he was also elected as a captain of one of Boston infantry companies as well as captain of the Artillery Company of Massachusetts. The colonial magistrates refused to grant him an exemption from the rule, and he was required to give up the Boston post. He was, apparently, allowed to retain his captaincy of the Artillery Company as the company was exempt from regulations governing the militia.
Governor John Endecott in 1652 sent a survey party to determine the colony&#x27;s northern boundary, which was specified by the charter to be north of the Merrimack River. This survey party discovered (incorrectly) that the northern limit of the Merrimack was near what is now known as Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. An east–west boundary at this latitude was found to include a number small settlements in what is now southern Maine. Endecott sent Leverett as one of several commissioners to negotiate the inclusion of these settlements into the colonial government, which resulted in the eventual formation of York County, Massachusetts. Leverett became interested in developing more land in Maine as result of this and other official visits, and invested in a significant amount of land there, over and above the lands inherited from his father.

In 1655 he was formally appointed as the Massachusetts colony&#x27;s agent in England. It is unclear, given the overlap with his governance in Acadia, when he actually went to England, but he served in this capacity until 1662. During the 1650s when Cromwell was Lord Protector the colony benefited from the relationship he had cultivated with Cromwell during the civil war. In particular, Cromwell took no steps to enforce the 1651 Navigation Act against the colony&#x27;s merchants, and also overlooked complaints about the colony&#x27;s repressive tactics against religious nonconformists. The latter occurred despite Leverett&#x27;s personal opposition to the colony&#x27;s extreme stance on religion. A common claim that Leverett was knighted by Charles II lacks a solid foundation in the documentary record.

==Military rule of Acadia and Nova Scotia==

In 1651 England and the Netherlands went to war. Word of this arrived in the New World in 1652, and rumors flew around the English colonies of New England that the Dutch in New Amsterdam were conspiring with all of the region&#x27;s Indians to make war against them. Leverett and Robert Sedgwick both saw a significant benefit for their trading operations if the Dutch could be eliminated as competitors, and lobbied for military action against New Amsterdam, although religious moderates like Simon Bradstreet were opposed to it. New Amsterdam&#x27;s Director-General Peter Stuyvesant invited a delegation from New England colonies to New Amsterdam to discuss the matter. Leverett was one of the commissioners sent in 1653; he took careful note of the colony&#x27;s defenses while he was there. The New Haven Colony petitioned the Commonwealth government of Oliver Cromwell for assistance against the Dutch threat, a position supported by Leverett, who went to England with Sedgwick in 1653 to press the colonial case for war.

Cromwell responded by giving Sedgwick a commission as military commander of the New England coast, and sent him and Leverett with several ships and some troops to make war on the Dutch. The fleet was to be augmented by a force of 500 New Englanders under Leverett&#x27;s command. By the time the New England force was raised in 1654, peace had been made between the English and Dutch. Sedgwick took advantage of his commission to act instead against the French in neighboring Acadia, which was home to privateers who preyed on English shipping. He captured the principal Acadian ports of Port Royal and Fort Pentagouet in July 1654. Sedgwick gave military command of the province to Leverett. Leverett governed Nova Scotia for three years, turning command over to Sir Thomas Temple in May 1657. During this time he and Sedgwick enforced a virtual trade monopoly on French Acadia for their benefit, leading some in the colony to view Leverett as a predatory opportunist. Leverett funded much of the cost of the occupation himself, and then petitioned Cromwell&#x27;s government for reimbursement. Although Cromwell authorized payment, he made it contingent on the colony performing an audit of Leverett&#x27;s finances, which never took place. Leverett was consequently still petitioning for compensation after the Restoration (1660).

==Military command and governorship==

From 1663 to 1673, Leverett held the rank of major-general of the Massachusetts militia, and was repeatedly elected as a deputy to the general court or to the council of assistants. During this time he oversaw the strengthening of Boston&#x27;s defenses. He was also again sent to the colonial settlements of New Hampshire and southern Maine, where some colonists had objected to Massachusetts rule and arrested colonial officials.

Following the restoration of Charles II to the throne, all of England&#x27;s colonies came under his scrutiny. In 1665, Charles sent four commissioners to Massachusetts. They were instructed to gain the colony&#x27;s agreement to terms demanded by Charles in a letter he sent to the colonial government in 1662, in which he instructed the colony to adopt more tolerant religious laws, and to enforce the Navigation Acts. The arrival of the commissioners was of some concern to the government, and Leverett was placed on a committee to draft a petition to the king demanding the commission&#x27;s recall. The document they drafted characterized the commissioners as &quot;agents of evil sent to Massachusetts to subvert its charter and destroy its independence.&quot;

Leverett served as deputy governor under governor Richard Bellingham from 1671 to 1672, and succeeded to his position after the governor&#x27;s death. His tenure as governor was chiefly notable because of King Philip&#x27;s War, and the rising threats to the colonial charter that culminated in its revocation in 1684. The colony angered the king by purchasing the claims of Sir Ferdinando Gorges to portions of Maine in 1677, a territory Charles had intended to acquire for his son, the Duke of Monmouth. Edward Randolph, sent by Charles to report on the New England colonies, reported in 1676 that Leverett believed the colony to be beyond the crown&#x27;s reach: &quot;He freely declared to me that the &quot;laws made by your Majesty and your Parliament obligeth them in nothing&quot; but what consists with the interest of that colony&quot;.

Although Leverett favored religious tolerance, there were still many in the colony who did not. Baptists were able to openly begin worship in Boston during his tenure, but he has also been criticized by Quaker historians for harsh anti-Quaker laws passed in 1677. The Baptists&#x27; time in Boston did not last, and they were thrown out in 1680 after Simon Bradstreet became governor.

==Death and legacy==

Leverett died in office, reportedly from complications of kidney stones, on 16 March 1678/9, and was interred at the King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground in Boston. His descendants include his grandson John, the seventh President of Harvard College, and Leverett Saltonstall, a 20th-century governor of Massachusetts. Leverett, Massachusetts, is named for his grandson.

Cotton Mather wrote of Leverett that he was &quot;one to whom the affections of the freemen were signalised his quick advances through the lesser stages of honor and office, unto the highest in the country; and one whose courage had been as much recommended by martial actions abroad in his younger years, as his wisdom and justice were now at home in his elder.&quot;

<text>Jean Margaret Laurence (née Wemyss; July 18, 1926 – January 5, 1987) was a Canadian novelist and short story writer, and is one of the major figures in Canadian literature. She was also a founder of the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada, a non-profit literary organization that seeks to encourage Canada&#x27;s writing community.
== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Margaret Laurence was born Jean Margaret Wemyss on 18 July 1926 in Neepawa, Manitoba, the daughter of solicitor Robert Wemyss and Verna Jean Simpson. She was known as &quot;Peggy&quot; during her childhood. Her mother died when she was four, after which a maternal aunt, Margaret Simpson, came to take care of the family. A year later Margaret Simpson married Robert Wemyss, and in 1933 they adopted a son, Robert. In 1935, when Laurence was nine, Robert Wemyss Sr. died of pneumonia. Laurence then moved into her maternal grandfather&#x27;s home with her stepmother and brother. She lived in Neepawa until she was 18.

=== Education ===
In 1944, Laurence attended Winnipeg&#x27;s United College, an arts and theology college associated with the University of Manitoba, that later became the University of Winnipeg. Before attending, she applied for academic scholarships that were granted based on her academic record and financial need. During her first year at United College, Laurence studied in a liberal arts program which included courses in English, History, Ethics, and Psychology. Laurence&#x27;s interest in English literature was present even in high school, and her interest in writing her own works continued into her formal education. Within the first few weeks of attending the college, Laurence had works of poetry published in the University of Manitoba&#x27;s publication &quot;The Manitoban.&quot; She submitted this work under the pseudonym &quot;Steve Lancaster&quot;, in what she later credits as a reference to the Lancaster bomber, a highly powerful and successful bomber of the Second World War. Another of Laurence&#x27;s achievements during her first year of college was being welcomed into the English Club, an organization of senior students who discussed poetry, led by professor Arthur L. Phelps. This was her first time being around peers who were also passionate about literature, and it was an opportunity for her to expand her knowledge as both scholar and writer. &quot;Tony&#x27;s&quot;, a part-cafeteria, part-coffee shop in the basement of United College, was another important place for Laurence to share her literary interests with colleagues. She met with friends and discussed literature; those who were writers shared their works with the group. Laurence&#x27;s years in college not only shaped her from an academic perspective, they also provided opportunities for her to develop creatively and professionally.

During this period Laurence became associated with the Christian socialist movement known as the Social Gospel, which remained important to her for the remainder of her life. In her senior year of college, Laurence had an increasing number of responsibilities while also continuing to have her own work printed in local publications. She became an associate editor of &quot;Vox&quot;, United College&#x27;s literary journal, and was also the publicity president of the Student Council. These opportunities encouraged Laurence to hone her craft of writing, while also giving her the tools to work in journalism—as she did upon graduation. She showed promise and success in her early literary pursuits. During her undergraduate years, Laurence had at least 18 poems, three short stories, and a critical essay published.

Laurence graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature in 1947.

=== Personal and later life ===
Following her graduation from United College, Laurence worked at a leftist weekly newspaper, &quot;The Westerner&quot;, and then at a new independent newspaper, the &quot;Winnipeg Citizen&quot;. In her reporting, she covered numerous social and political issues; she also wrote a radio column and reviewed books. Also not long after graduating, she married Jack Fergus Laurence, an engineer. His work took them to England (1949), the then-British protectorate of British Somaliland (1950–1952), as well as the British colony of the Gold Coast (1952–1957).

Laurence developed an admiration for Africa and its various populations, which found expression in her writing. Laurence was so moved by the oral literature of Somalia that she began recording and translating poetry and folk tales, which would later be compiled into the work &quot;A Tree for Poverty: Somali Poetry and Prose&quot; (1954). The two-year experience of witnessing attempts to drill wells in Somalia&#x27;s desert, and observing the social lives of both ex-pats and Somalis, would later be documented in her 1963 memoir, &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Camel Bell&quot;.

In 1952, Laurence gave birth to daughter Jocelyn during a leave in England. Son David was born in 1955 in the Gold Coast. The family left the Gold Coast before it gained independence as Ghana in 1957, moving to Vancouver, British Columbia, where they stayed for five years.

In 1962, she separated from her husband and moved to London, England for a year. She then moved to Elm Cottage (Penn, Buckinghamshire) where she lived for more than ten years, although she visited Canada often. Her divorce became final in 1969. That year, she became writer-in-residence at the University of Toronto. A few years later, she moved to Lakefield, Ontario. She also bought a cabin on the Otonabee River near Peterborough, Ontario, where she wrote &quot;The Diviners&quot; (1974) during the summers of 1971 to 1973. In 1978, she was the subject of a National Film Board of Canada documentary, &quot;Margaret Laurence: First Lady of Manawaka&quot;. Laurence served as Chancellor of Trent University in Peterborough from 1981 to 1983.

=== Death ===
In 1986, Laurence was diagnosed with lung cancer late in the disease&#x27;s development. According to the James King biography, &quot;The Life of Margaret Laurence&quot;, the prognosis was grave, and as the cancer had spread to other organs, there was no treatment offered beyond palliative care. Laurence decided the best course of action was to spare herself and her family further suffering. She died by suicide at her home at 8 Regent St., Lakefield, on January 5, 1987, by taking a drug overdose, documenting her decision in writing until the time of her death. She was buried in her hometown in the Neepawa Cemetery, Neepawa, Manitoba. Laurence&#x27;s house in Neepawa has been turned into a museum. Her literary papers are housed in the Clara Thomas Archives at York University in Toronto and at McMaster University&#x27;s William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections in Hamilton.

== Literary career ==
One of Canada&#x27;s most esteemed and beloved authors by the end of her literary career, Laurence began writing short stories in her teenage years while in Neepawa. Her first published piece &quot;The Land of Our Father&quot; was submitted to a competition held by the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;. This story contains the first appearance of the name &quot;Manawaka&quot; (a fictional Canadian town used in many of her later works). Shortly after her marriage, Margaret began to write more prolifically, as did her husband. Each published fiction in literary periodicals while living in Africa, but Margaret continued to write and expand her range. Her early novels were influenced by her experience as a minority in Africa. They show a strong sense of Christian symbolism and ethical concern for being a white person in a colonial state.

It was after her return to Canada that she wrote &quot;The Stone Angel&quot; (1964), the novel for which she is best known. Set in a fictional Manitoba small town named Manawaka, the story is narrated by 90-year-old Hagar Shipley, alternating between her present moments and recollections of her entire life. The novel was for a time required reading in many North American school systems and colleges. Laurence wrote four more works of fiction set in Manawaka. Laurence was published by the Canadian publishing company McClelland and Stewart, and she became one of the key figures in the emerging Canadian literature tradition.

&quot;Rachel, Rachel&quot; is a 1968 film directed by Paul Newman, based on Laurence&#x27;s novel &quot;A Jest of God&quot;. &quot;The Stone Angel&quot;, a feature-length film based on Laurence&#x27;s novel, written and directed by Kari Skogland and starring Ellen Burstyn, premiered in Fall 2007.

=== Awards and recognition ===
Laurence won two Governor General&#x27;s Awards for her novels &quot;A Jest of God&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Diviners&quot; (1974). In 1972 she was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada.

The Margaret Laurence Memorial Lecture is an annual lecture series organized by the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada.

&quot;The Stone Angel&quot; was one of the selected books in the 2002 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, championed by Leon Rooke.

The University of Winnipeg named a Women&#x27;s Studies Centre, and an annual speaker series, in Laurence&#x27;s honour.

At York University in Toronto, one of the undergraduate residence buildings (Bethune Residence) named a floor after her.

In 2016, she was named a National Historic Person.

<doc id="547733" wikidata="Q753527" url="?curid=547733" title="Northrop YF-23">
<text>The Northrop/McDonnell Douglas YF-23 is an American single-seat, twin-engine, stealth fighter technology demonstrator prototype designed for the United States Air Force (USAF). The design team, with Northrop as the prime contractor, was a finalist in the USAF&#x27;s Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) demonstration/validation competition, battling the YF-22 team for full-scale development and production. Nicknamed &quot;Black Widow II&quot;, two YF-23 prototypes were built.

In the 1980s, the USAF began looking for a replacement for its F-15 fighter aircraft to more effectively counter emerging threats such as the Soviet Union&#x27;s advanced Su-27 and MiG-29. Several companies submitted design proposals; the USAF selected proposals from Northrop and Lockheed for demonstration/validation. Northrop teamed up with McDonnell Douglas to develop the YF-23, while Lockheed, Boeing, and General Dynamics developed the YF-22. The YF-23 was stealthier and faster, but less agile than its competitor. After a four-year development and evaluation process, the YF-22 team was announced as the winner in 1991 and developed the F-22 Raptor, which first flew in 1997 and entered service in 2005. The U.S. Navy considered using a naval version of the ATF as an F-14 replacement, but these plans were later canceled due to costs.

After flight testing, both YF-23s were placed in storage while various agencies considered plans to use them for further research, although none proceeded. In 2004, Northrop Grumman used the second YF-23 as a display model for its proposed regional bomber aircraft, but this project was dropped because longer range bombers were required. The two YF-23 prototypes are currently exhibits at the National Museum of the United States Air Force and the Western Museum of Flight respectively.

==Development==
===Concept definition===
American reconnaissance satellites first spotted the advanced Soviet Su-27 and MiG-29 fighter prototypes between 1977 and 1979, which caused concern in the U.S. Both Soviet models were expected to reduce the combat and maneuverability advantages of contemporary U.S. fighter aircraft, including the newly introduced F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. Additionally, U.S. tactical airpower would be further threatened by new Soviet systems such as the A-50 airborne warning and control system (AWACS) revealed in 1978 and more advanced surface-to-air missile systems. In 1981, the USAF began developing requirements and discussing with the aerospace industry on concepts for an Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) with both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions in consideration. The ATF was to take advantage of emerging technologies, including composite materials, lightweight alloys, advanced flight-control systems, more powerful propulsion systems, and stealth technology.
The USAF released the ATF request for information (RFI) in May 1981 to several aerospace companies on possible features for the new fighter. Eventually code-named &quot;Senior Sky&quot;, the ATF at this time was still in the midst of requirements definition, which meant that there was considerable variety in the industry responses. Northrop submitted three designs for the RFI, ranging from ultra low-cost, to highly agile, to low-observable missileer; all were on the small and light end of the response spectrum. In 1983, the ATF System Program Office (SPO) was formed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base from the initial Concept Development Team (CDT). After discussions with aerospace companies and Tactical Air Command (TAC), the CDT/SPO made air-to-air combat the primary role for the ATF, which would replace the F-15 and emphasize outstanding kinematic performance with supersonic cruise and maneuver. Northrop&#x27;s response was a Mach 2+ fighter design designated N-360 with delta wings, a single vertical tail, and twin engines with thrust vectoring nozzles and thrust reversers. Around this time, the SPO also became aware of the very low radar cross section (RCS) results from the Air Force&#x27;s &quot;black world&quot; innovations such as the &quot;Have Blue&quot;/F-117 (&quot;&quot;Senior Trend&quot;), &quot;Tacit Blue&quot;, and the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) program (which would result in the B-2, or &quot;Senior Ice&quot;&quot;); consequently, the SPO increasingly emphasized stealth for survivability and combat effectiveness while still requiring fighter-like speed and maneuverability.

Northrop was able to quickly adapt to the ATF&#x27;s increasing emphasis on stealth. Since October 1981, a small team of engineers under Rob Sandusky within its ATB/B-2 division had been working on stealth fighter designs. Sandusky would later be the Northrop ATF&#x27;s Chief Engineer, while fellow B-2 stealth engineer Yu Ping Liu was recruited in 1985 as the chief scientist. Three design concepts were studied: the Agile Maneuverable Fighter (AMF) similar to N-360 with two canted vertical tails and the best aerodynamic performance of the three while having minimal stealth, Ultra Stealth Fighter (USF) that emphasized maximum stealth through edge alignment with only four RCS lobes and nicknamed &quot;Christmas Tree&quot; for its planform shape, and High Stealth Fighter (HSF) that balanced stealth and maneuverability with diamond wings, all-moving V-tail &quot;ruddervators&quot; (or butterfly tails), engine exhaust troughs, and aligned edges. First emerging in 1983, HSF would take many design cues from the B-2 to reduce its susceptibility to radar and infrared detection, and Liu&#x27;s understanding of both radar signatures and aerodynamics would lend itself to key design features, such as the shaping of the nose (nicknamed the &quot;platypus&quot; for the initial shape and pronounced chine edges) and canopy with their continuously curved, Gaussian surfaces. By 1985, HSF had evolved to be recognizably similar to the eventual YF-23 and emerged as the optimal balance of stealth and aerodynamic performance.

===Demonstration and validation===

By November 1984, concept exploration had allowed the SPO to narrow its requirements and release the Statement of Operational Need, which called for a takeoff weight fighter with stealth and excellent kinematics, including prolonged supersonic flight without the use of afterburners, or supercruise. In September 1985, the USAF issued the request for proposal (RFP) for demonstration and validation (Dem/Val) to several aircraft manufacturers with the top four proposals, later cut down to two to reduce program costs, proceeding to the next phase; in addition to the ATF&#x27;s demanding technical requirements, the RFP also emphasized systems engineering, technology development plans, and risk mitigation. The RFP would see some changes after initial release; following the SPO&#x27;s discussions with Lockheed and Northrop regarding their experiences with the F-117 and B-2, all-aspect stealth requirements were drastically increased in late 1985. Although there was initially no requirement for the evaluation of prototype air vehicles, this was added in May 1986 due to recommendations from the Packard Commission, a federal commission by President Ronald Reagan to study Department of Defense procurement practices. At this time, the USAF envisioned procuring 750 ATFs at a unit flyaway cost of $35 million in fiscal year (FY) 1985 dollars (~$ in ). Furthermore, the U.S. Navy under the Navy Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF) program eventually announced in 1988 that it would use a derivative of the ATF winner to replace its F-14 Tomcat and called for the procurement of 546 aircraft.
Northrop&#x27;s early work on the HSF would pay off for the Dem/Val RFP. By January 1986, the HSF would evolve into Design Proposal 86E (DP86E) as a refined and well-understood concept through extensive computational fluid dynamics simulations, wind tunnel testing, and RCS pole testing and became Northrop&#x27;s preference for its ATF submission. Furthermore, Northrop&#x27;s ability to design and analyze stealthy curved surfaces, stemming back to its work on &quot;Tacit Blue&quot; and the ATB/B-2, gave their designers an early advantage in combining stealth with aerodynamics, especially since Lockheed, the only other company with extensive stealth experience, had previously relied on faceting as on the F-117 and lost the ATB to Northrop as a result. That loss, along with the poor aerodynamic performance of their early faceted ATF concept, forced Lockheed to also develop designs and analysis methods with curved stealthy surfaces. Northrop&#x27;s HSF design would be refined into DP110, which was its submission for the Dem/Val RFP.

In July 1986, proposals for Dem/Val were submitted by Lockheed, Boeing, General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, Northrop, Grumman and North American Rockwell; the latter two dropped out of the competition shortly thereafter. As contractors were expected to make significant investments for technology development, companies forming teams was encouraged by the SPO. Following proposal submissions, Northrop and McDonnell Douglas formed a team to develop whichever of their proposed designs was selected, if any. Lockheed, Boeing, and General Dynamics formed a team with a similar agreement.

Lockheed and Northrop, the two industry leaders in stealth aircraft, were selected as the two finalists on 31 October 1986 for Dem/Val at first and second place, although the approaches to their proposals were markedly different. Northrop&#x27;s refined and well-understood design proposal was a significant advantage, especially in contrast to Lockheed&#x27;s immature design, but the Lockheed proposal&#x27;s focus on systems engineering rather than a point aircraft design actually pulled it ahead. Both teams were awarded $691 million in FY 1985 dollars (~$ in ) and given 50 months for demonstration and validation, culminating in the flight-test of their prototypes. Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric were contracted to develop the engines, designated YF119 and YF120 respectively, for the ATF engine competition. Because of the late addition of the prototyping requirement due to political pressure, the prototype air vehicles were to be &quot;best-effort&quot; machines not meant to perform a competitive flyoff or represent a production aircraft that meets every requirement, but to demonstrate the viability of its concept and mitigate risk.

===Design refinement===

As one of the winning companies for the Dem/Val proposals, Northrop was the program lead of the YF-23 team with McDonnell Douglas; the two had previously collaborated on the F/A-18 Hornet. In addition to the government contract awards, the team would eventually invest $650 million (~$ in ) combined into their ATF effort; General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, the two engine companies, also invested $100 million (~$ in ) each. Airframe fabrication was divided roughly evenly, with Northrop building the aft fuselage and empennage in Hawthorne, California and performing final assembly at Edwards Air Force Base while McDonnell Douglas built the wings and forward fuselage in St. Louis, Missouri. Manufacturing was greatly assisted by the use of computer-aided design software. However, the YF-23 design would largely be a continual refinement from Northrop&#x27;s DP110 HSF with little influence from McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s design, which had swept trapezoidal wings, four empennage surfaces, and chin-mounted split wedge inlets and did not perform well for stealth. The YF-23&#x27;s design evolved into DP117K when it was frozen as the prototype configuration in January 1988, with changes including a sharper and more voluminous nose from the earlier &quot;platypus&quot; shape for better radar performance and a strengthened aft deck with lower drag shaping. Due to the complex surface curvature, the aircraft was built outside-in, with the large composite skin structures fabricated first before the internal members. To ensure precise and responsive handling characteristics, Northrop developed and tested the flight control laws using both a large-scale simulator as well as a modified C-131 Samaritan named the Total In Flight Simulator (TIFS).

Throughout Dem/Val, the SPO conducted System Requirements Reviews (SRR) where it reviewed results of performance and cost trade studies with both teams to develop the ATF system specifications and, if necessary, adjusted requirements and deleted ones that added substantial weight or cost while having marginal value. The ATF was initially required to land and stop within , which meant the use of thrust reversers on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the runway length requirement to and by 1988 the requirement for thrust reversers was no longer needed. This allowed Northrop to have smaller engine nacelle housings with the space between them filled in to preserve area ruling in subsequent design refinements for the F-23 full system design, or Preferred System Concept (PSC). As the YF-23 design (DP117K) had been frozen by then, the nacelles — nicknamed &quot;bread loafs&quot; for their flat upper surface — were not downsized on the prototypes. The number of internal missiles (with the AIM-120A as the reference baseline) was reduced from eight to six. Despite these adjustments, both teams struggled to achieve the 50,000-lb takeoff gross weight goal, and this was subsequently increased to while engine thrust was increased from class to class.

Aside from advances in air vehicle and engine design, the ATF also required innovations in avionics and sensor systems with the goal of achieving sensor fusion to enhance situational awareness and reduce pilot workload. The YF-23 was meant as a demonstrator for the airframe and propulsion system design and thus did not mount any mission systems avionics of the PSC F-23. Instead, Northrop and McDonnell Douglas tested these systems on ground and airborne laboratories with Northrop using a modified BAC One-Eleven as a flying avionics laboratory and McDonnell Douglas building the Avionics Ground Prototype (AGP) to evaluate software and hardware performance and reliability. Avionics requirements were also the subject of SPO SRRs with contractors and adjusted during Dem/Val. For example, the infrared search and track (IRST) sensor was dropped from a baseline requirement to provision for future addition in 1989.
Formally designated as the YF-23A, the first aircraft (serial number &quot;87-0800&quot;), Prototype Air Vehicle 1 (PAV-1), was rolled out on 22 June 1990. PAV-1 took its 50-minute maiden flight on 27 August with chief test pilot Alfred &quot;Paul&quot; Metz at the controls. The second YF-23 (serial number &quot;87-0801&quot;, PAV-2) made its first flight on 26 October, piloted by Jim Sandberg. The first YF-23 was painted charcoal gray and was nicknamed &quot;Gray Ghost&quot;. The second prototype was painted in two shades of gray and nicknamed &quot;Spider&quot;. PAV-1 briefly had a red hourglass painted on its ram air scoop to prevent injury to ground crew. The red hourglass resembled the marking on the underside of the black widow spider, further reinforcing the unofficial nickname &quot;Black Widow II&quot; given to the YF-23 because of its 8-lobe radar cross section plot shape that resembled a spider and as homage to the Northrop P-61 Black Widow of World War II. When Northrop management found out about the marking, they had it removed.

===Naval variant===
A proposed naval variant of the F-23, sometimes known as the NATF-23 (the design was never formally designated), was considered as an F-14 Tomcat replacement. The original HSF configuration of the F-23 was first considered but would have had issues with flight deck space, handling, storage, landing, and catapult launching, thus necessitating a different design. By 1989, the design was narrowed down to two possible configurations: DP533 with four tails and DP527 with two V-tails and canards. DP527 was eventually determined to be the best solution. The NATF-23 design was submitted along with the F-23 proposal for full-scale development, or engineering and manufacturing development (EMD), in December 1990, although by late 1990 the Navy was already beginning to back out of the NATF program and fully abandoned it by FY 1992 due to escalating costs. A wind tunnel test model of DP527, tested for 14,000 hours, was donated (with canards removed) by Boeing St. Louis (formerly McDonnell Douglas) in 2001 to the Bellefontaine Neighbors Klein Park Veterans Memorial in St. Louis, Missouri.

==Design==
The YF-23A was a prototype air vehicle intended to demonstrate the viability of Northrop&#x27;s ATF proposal, which was designed to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Owing to its continual maturation from the initial HSF concept which it still greatly resembled, the YF-23&#x27;s shaping was highly refined. It was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with diamond-shaped wings tapered symmetrically (edges swept 40° front and back), a profile with substantial area-ruling to reduce wave drag, and all-moving V-tails, or &quot;ruddervators&quot;. The cockpit was placed high, near the nose of the aircraft, for good visibility for the pilot. The chiseled shape of the nose, with its sharp chine edges, generated vortices to improve high angle of attack (AoA) characteristics. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The aerial refueling receptacle was centered on the spine of the forward fuselage. A single large weapons bay was placed on the underside of the fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit had a center stick and side throttles.
It was powered by two turbofan engines, with each in a separate engine nacelle with S-ducts to shield engine axial compressors from radar waves, on either side of the aircraft&#x27;s spine. The fixed-geometry inlets were trapezoidal in frontal profile, with a bleed system to absorb the turbulent boundary layer by using special porous suction panels in front of the inlet. The boundary layer air was then ducted to vents and doors over the fuselage and wings. Of the two aircraft built, the first YF-23 (PAV-1) had Pratt &amp; Whitney YF119 engines, while the second (PAV-2) was powered by General Electric YF120 engines. The aircraft had single-expansion ramp nozzles (SERN) and, unlike the YF-22, did not employ thrust vectoring. As on the B-2, the exhaust from the YF-23&#x27;s engines flowed through troughs in the aft deck lined with heat-abating tiles to shield the engines from infrared homing (IR) missile detection from below. The tiles, built by GM Allison, were &quot;transpiration cooled&quot; from engine bleed air to dissipate heat. The YF-23&#x27;s propulsion and aerodynamics, designed to minimize drag at transonic and supersonic speeds, enabled it to cruise efficiently at over Mach 1.5 without afterburners.
The YF-23 was statically unstable — having relaxed stability — and flown through fly-by-wire which provided artificial stability with the flight control surfaces controlled by a central management computer system. Raising the wing flaps and ailerons on one side and lowering them on the other provided roll. The V-tail fins were angled 50 degrees from the vertical. Pitch was mainly provided by rotating these V-tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw was primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. Test pilot Paul Metz stated that the YF-23 had superior high AoA performance compared to legacy aircraft, with trimmed AoA of up to 60°. Deflecting the wing flaps down and ailerons up on both sides simultaneously provided for aerodynamic braking. To keep prototyping costs low despite the novel design, some &quot;commercial off-the-shelf&quot; components were used, including an F-15 nose wheel, F/A-18 main landing gear parts, and the forward cockpit components of the F-15E Strike Eagle.

===Production F-23===

The proposed production F-23 configuration (DP231 for the F119 engine and DP232 for the F120 engine) for full-scale development, or Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD), represented the final refinement of the HSF concept and would have differed from the YF-23 prototypes in several ways. Rather than a single weapons bay, the EMD design would instead have had two tandem bays in the lengthened forward fuselage, with the forward bay designed for short range AIM-9 missiles and the aft main bay for AIM-120 missiles and bombs. An M61 rotary cannon would be installed on the left side of the forward fuselage. The F-23&#x27;s overall length and height were slightly increased to and respectively while wingspan remained about the same at . Fuselage volume was expanded for avionics and more fuel, with the nose and radome enlarged to accept sensors and mission systems, including the active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The forward fuselage cross section was more squared off with the forebody chines less pronounced and raised to the same waterline height as the leading edge of the wing. The deletion of thrust reversers enabled the engine nacelles to have a smaller, more rounded cross-section and the trough between them filled in to preserve area-ruling. The edges of the exhaust trough&#x27;s heat-abating lining in the aft deck were aligned with the planform angles for stealth. The inlet design changed from the trapezoidal profile with suction panels to a serrated semicircle with a compression bump and the boundary layer control vents were simplified. The fuselage and empennage trailing edge pattern would also have fewer serrations and the engine thrust lines were toed in at 1.5° off center. The EMD proposal had both single-seat F-23A and two-seat F-23B variants.

===NATF-23===

The naval NATF-23 variant (internally designated DP527), the schematics of which surfaced in the 2010s, was different in many ways due to the requirements of aircraft carrier operations as well as the Navy&#x27;s greater emphasis on long range sensors, weapons, and loiter time for fleet air defense. The diamond wings were located as far back as possible, and the aircraft had ruddervators with more serrations to reduce overall length, folding wing capability for flight deck storage, reinforced landing gear, tailhook and dihedral canted canards for increased maneuverability at low speeds to land on aircraft carriers, and two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles instead of SERNs. The inlet design was also different, being a quarter circle with serrations and a bumped compression surface. The internal weapons bay was split into two compartments by a bulkhead along the centerline in the forward fuselage to strengthen the aircraft&#x27;s keel and would have accommodated the Navy&#x27;s planned AIM-152 advanced air-to-air missiles (AAAM) as well as potentially the AGM-88 HARM and AGM-84 Harpoon. The bay doors would carry AIM-9 missiles and an M61 rotary cannon would be installed in a fairing in the right wing. The NATF-23 had an increased wingspan and height, while overall length was reduced to , the same as the F-14. Folded wingspan would be . Like the Air Force version, the NATF-23 had both single-seat and two-seat variants.

===Proposed revival===

In 2004, Northrop Grumman proposed an F-23-based bomber called the FB-23 &quot;Rapid Theater Attack&quot; (RTA) to meet a USAF solicitation for an interim regional bomber, for which the Lockheed Martin FB-22 and Boeing B-1R were also competing. The FB-23 would have a two-seat cockpit and a similar planform shape as the F-23, but considerably larger in all dimensions, about in overall length, to fulfill the bomber role with a combat radius of over and internal payload of . The engines would also have round axisymmetric nozzles above the aft deck rather than each having a single wedge-shaped flap. Northrop Grumman modified the YF-23 PAV-2 to serve as a display model for its proposed interim bomber. The possibility of an FB-23 interim bomber ended with the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, which favored a long-range strategic bomber with much greater range. The USAF has since moved on to the Next-Generation Bomber and Long Range Strike Bomber program.

In 2018, Northrop Grumman responded to a Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) solicitation for industry partners to assist with the development of its 5th/6th generation (F-X) fighter. There was speculation that the company could offer a modernized version of the F-23 to the JASDF, while Lockheed Martin offered an airframe derived from the F-22; Japan ultimately did not select these proposals due to costs and industrial work-share concerns.

==Operational history==
===Evaluation===

The first YF-23, with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, supercruised at Mach 1.43 on 18 September 1990, while the second, with General Electric engines, officially reached over Mach 1.6 on 29 November 1990, topping out at Mach 1.72. By comparison, the YF-22 achieved Mach 1.58 in supercruise. The YF-23 was tested to a top speed of Mach 1.8 with afterburners and achieved a maximum angle-of-attack of 25°. The maximum speed is classified, though sources state a speed greater than Mach 2 at altitude in full afterburner. The aircraft&#x27;s weapons bay was configured for weapons launch, and used for testing weapons bay acoustics, but no missiles were fired; Lockheed fired AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles successfully from its YF-22 demonstration aircraft. PAV-1 performed a fast-paced combat demonstration with six flights over a 10-hour period on 30 November 1990. Flight testing continued into December. The two YF-23s flew 50 times for a total of 65.2 hours. The tests demonstrated Northrop&#x27;s predicted performance values for the YF-23. Both designs met or exceeded all performance requirements; the YF-23 was stealthier and faster, but the YF-22 was more agile.
The two contractor teams submitted evaluation results and their PSC proposals for full-scale development in December 1990, and on 23 April 1991, Donald Rice, the Secretary of the Air Force announced that the YF-22 team was the winner. The Air Force also selected the Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engine to power the F-22 production version. The Lockheed and Pratt &amp; Whitney designs were rated higher on technical aspects, considered lower risk (the YF-23 flew considerably fewer sorties and hours than its counterpart), and were considered to have more effective program management. It has been speculated in the aviation press that the Lockheed design was also seen as more adaptable as the basis for the Navy&#x27;s NATF, but by FY 1992 the U.S. Navy had abandoned NATF.

Following the competition, both YF-23s were transferred to NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards AFB, California, without their engines. NASA planned to use one of the aircraft to study techniques for the calibration of predicted loads to measured flight results, but this did not happen. Both YF-23 airframes remained in storage until mid-1996 when they were transferred to museums, with PAV-2 briefly serving as a display model for the proposed FB-23 regional bomber in 2004.

<doc id="547735" wikidata="Q604747" url="?curid=547735" title="Internal capsule">
<text>The internal capsule is a paired white matter structure, as a two-way tract, carrying ascending and descending fibers, to and from the cerebral cortex. The internal capsule is situated in the inferomedial part of each cerebral hemisphere of the brain. It carries information past the subcortical basal ganglia. As it courses it separates the caudate nucleus and the thalamus from the putamen and the globus pallidus. It also separates the caudate nucleus and the putamen in the dorsal striatum, a brain region involved in motor and reward pathways.

The internal capsule is V-shaped in transection forming an anterior and posterior limb, with the angle between them called the genu.

The corticospinal tract constitutes a large part of the internal capsule, carrying motor information from the primary motor cortex to the lower motor neurons in the spinal cord. Above the basal ganglia the corticospinal tract is a part of the corona radiata. Below the basal ganglia the tract is called cerebral crus (a part of the cerebral peduncle) and below the pons it is referred to as the corticospinal tract.

==Structure==
The internal capsule is V-shaped when cut horizontally in a transverse plane, and consists of three parts: the genu, anterior limb, and posterior limb.

===Genu===
The genu is the bend, or flexure in the V of the internal capsule. It is formed by fibers from the corticobulbar tract. The fibers in this region are named the geniculate fibers that carry upper motor neurons from the motor cortex to cranial nerve nuclei that mainly govern muscle motion of the head and face. The geniculate fibers originate in the motor cortex, and after passing downward through the base of the cerebral peduncle with the cerebrospinal fibers, undergo decussation and end in the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves of the opposite side. 

=== Anterior limb ===
The anterior limb of the internal capsule (or crus anterius) is situated in front of the genu, between the head of the caudate nucleus and the lentiform nucleus. It contains: 
# Thalamocortical fibers passing from the lateral thalamic nuclei to the frontal lobe
# Corticothalamic fibres passing from the frontal lobe to the lateral thalamic nuclei
# Transversely oriented fibers connecting the caudate nucleus to the putamen
# Corticostriatal fibers connecting the cortex with the striatum 
# Frontopontine fibers passing from the frontal lobe through the medial fifth of the base of the cerebral peduncle to the pontine nuclei
# Thalamic pontine fibers 

=== Posterior limb ===
The posterior limb of internal capsule (or occipital part) is the portion of the internal capsule posterior to the genu. It is situated between the thalamus and the lentiform nucleus.

The anterior half of the posterior limb contains fibers of the corticospinal tract, and corticobulbar tract (in an anteroposterior somatotropic arrangement), as well as corticorubral fibres (passing from the frontal lobe to the red nucleus) that accompany the corticospinal tract.

The posterior third of the posterior limb contains: 
# Third-order sensory neurons passing from the posterolateral nucleus of thalamus to the postcentral gyrus (in an anteroposterior somatotropic arrangement)
# Fibers of the optic radiation, from the lower visual centers to the cortex of the occipital lobe;
# Acoustic fibers, from the lateral lemniscus to the temporal lobe
# Fibers that pass from the occipital and temporal lobes to the pontine nuclei

The retrolenticular part contains fibers from the optic system, coming from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. More posteriorly, this becomes the optic radiation. Some fibers from the medial geniculate nucleus (which carry auditory information) also pass in the retrolenticular internal capsule, but most are in the sublenticular part.

The sublenticular part is beneath the lentiform nucleus, and contains fibers connecting with the temporal lobe. These include the auditory radiations and temporopontine fibers.
=== Blood supply ===
The superior parts of both the anterior and posterior limbs, and the genu of the internal capsule are supplied by the lenticulostriate arteries, which are branches of the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery.

The inferior half of the anterior limb is supplied via the recurrent artery of Heubner, which is a branch of the anterior cerebral artery.

The inferior half of the posterior limb is supplied by the anterior choroidal artery, which is a branch of the internal carotid artery.

As in many parts of the body, some degree of variation in the blood supply exists. For example, thalamoperforator arteries, which are branches of the basilar artery, occasionally supply the inferior half of the posterior limb.

==Function==
The internal capsule provides passage to ascending and descending fibres running to and from the cerebral cortex. Fibers include frontopontine fibers from the frontal lobe to the pontine nuclei; thalamocortical radiations; corticobulbar fibers from the cortex to the medulla oblongata, and corticospinal fibers.

==Clinical significance==

The lenticulostriate arteries supply a large part of the internal capsule. These small vessels are particularly vulnerable to narrowing in the setting of chronic hypertension and can result in small, punctate infarctions or intraparenchymal haemorrhage due to vessel rupture.

=== Focal lesions ===
Due to the orderly somatotropic arrangement of elements of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, small lesions can produce selective functional deficits.

Lesions of the genu of the internal capsule affect fibers of the corticobulbar tract.

The primary motor cortex sends its axons through the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Lesions, therefore, result in a contralateral hemiparesis or hemiplegia. While symptoms of weakness due to an isolated lesion of the posterior limb can initially be severe, recovery of motor function is sometimes possible due to spinal projections of premotor cortical regions that are contained more rostrally in the internal capsule.

<doc id="547738" wikidata="Q2622320" url="?curid=547738" title="Jared Ingersoll">
<text>Jared Ingersoll Jr. (October 24, 1749 – October 31, 1822) was an American Founding Father, lawyer, and statesman from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress and a signer of the United States Constitution. He served as DeWitt Clinton&#x27;s running mate in the 1812 election, but Clinton and Ingersoll were defeated by James Madison and Elbridge Gerry.

Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Ingersoll established a legal career in Philadelphia after graduating from Yale College. The son of British colonial official Jared Ingersoll Sr., Ingersoll lived in Europe from 1773 to 1776 to avoid the growing political conflict between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. In 1778, having committed himself to the cause of American independence, Ingersoll returned to Philadelphia and won election to the Continental Congress. Ingersoll became convinced of the need for a stronger national government than what was provided by the Articles of Confederation, and he was a delegate to the 1787 Philadelphia Convention. Though he was initially seeking amendments for the Articles of Confederation, he eventually came to support the new Constitution that was produced by the convention.

He served as the Pennsylvania Attorney General from 1791 to 1800 and from 1811 to 1816. He also served as the United States Attorney for Pennsylvania and as the city solicitor for Philadelphia. He argued the cases of &quot;Chisholm v. Georgia&quot; and &quot;Hylton v. United States&quot;, two of the first cases to appear before the United States Supreme Court.

Ingersoll affiliated with the Federalist Party and was deeply disturbed by Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s victory in the 1800 presidential election. In 1812, the Democratic-Republican Party split between President Madison and Clinton. The Federalists decided to support a ticket of Clinton and Ingersoll in hopes of defeating the incumbent president. Madison prevailed in the election, winning Ingersoll&#x27;s crucial home state of Pennsylvania.

==Life and career==
Jared Ingersoll was a supporter of the Revolutionary cause. His training as a lawyer convinced him that the problems of the newly independent states were caused by the inadequacy of the Articles of Confederation. He became an early and ardent proponent of constitutional reform, although, like a number of his colleagues at the Constitutional Convention, he believed this reform could be achieved by a simple revision of the Articles. Only after weeks of debate did he come to see that a new document was necessary. His major contribution to the cause of constitutional government came not during the convention but later during a lengthy and distinguished legal career when he helped define many of the principles enunciated at Philadelphia.

===Early life===
Born in New Haven, Connecticut, Ingersoll was the son of Jared Ingersoll Sr., a prominent British official whose strong Loyalist sentiments would lead to his being tarred and feathered by radical Patriots. The Ingersoll family was of English descent. In 1765, the year the Stamp Act was imposed on the colonies in America, the British Crown appointed the elder Jared Ingersoll as Stamp Master, the colonial agent in London, for the colony of Connecticut. As the next few months passed and animosity over the Stamp Act grew, Ingersoll became the most hated man in the colony. Between August 21 and 29, 1765, the Sons of Liberty hung his effigy in various parts of the colony. He wrote an account of Isaac Barre&#x27;s speech made during the Parliamentary debate on the Stamp Act to Connecticut Governor Thomas Fitch. He would later be involved in a controversial role as the agent who enforced the resulting Stamp Act in Connecticut.

The younger Ingersoll completed Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven in 1762, graduated from Yale College in 1766, studied law in Philadelphia, and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1773. Although by training and inclination a Patriot sympathizer, the young Ingersoll shied away from the cause at the outset because of a strong sense of personal loyalty to his distinguished father. On his father&#x27;s advice, he sought to escape the growing political controversy at home by retiring to London to continue his study of the law at the Middle Temple School (1773–1776) and to tour extensively through Europe. He spent more than eighteen months in Paris, where he formed an acquaintance with Benjamin Franklin.

=== American Revolution ===
Shortly after the colonies declared their independence, Ingersoll renounced his family&#x27;s views, made his personal commitment to the cause of independence, and returned home. In 1778 he arrived in Philadelphia as a confirmed Patriot. With the help of influential friends he quickly established a flourishing law practice, and shortly after he entered the fray as a delegate to the Continental Congress (1780–81). In 1781 Ingersoll married Elizabeth Pettit and in that same year was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. Always a supporter of strong central authority in political affairs, he became a leading agitator for reforming the national government in the postwar years, preaching the need for change to his friends in Congress and to the legal community.

At the convention, Ingersoll was counted among those who favored revision of the existing Articles of Confederation, but in the end he joined with the majority and supported a plan for a new federal government. Despite his national reputation as an attorney, Ingersoll seldom participated in the Convention debates, although he attended all sessions.

===Career after the Constitutional Convention===
Once the new national government was created, Ingersoll returned to the law. Except for a few excursions into politics—he was a member of Philadelphia&#x27;s Common Council (1789), and, as a stalwart Federalist who considered the election of Thomas Jefferson in 1800 a &quot;great subversion,&quot; he ran unsuccessfully for vice president on the Federalist ticket in 1812—his public career centered on legal affairs. He served as attorney general of Pennsylvania (1790–1799 and 1811–1817), as Philadelphia&#x27;s city solicitor (1798–1801), and as U.S. district attorney for Pennsylvania (1800–01). For a brief period (1821–22), he sat as presiding judge of the Philadelphia district court.

Ingersoll&#x27;s major contribution to the cause of constitutional government came not during the convention but later during a lengthy and distinguished legal career, when he helped define many of the principles enunciated at Philadelphia. He made his contributions to the Constitutional process through several Supreme Court cases that defined various basic points in Constitutional law during the beginning of the new republic. In one definitive case he represented Georgia in &quot;Chisholm v. Georgia&quot; (1793), a landmark case in states&#x27; rights. Here the court decided against him, ruling that a state may be sued in federal court by a citizen of another state. This reversal of the notion of state sovereignty was later rescinded by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution. In representing Hylton in &quot;Hylton v. US&quot; (1796), Ingersoll was also involved in the first legal challenge to the constitutionality of an act of Congress. In this case, the Supreme Court upheld the government&#x27;s right to impose a tax on carriages. Ingersoll also served as counsel in various cases that helped clarify constitutional issues concerning the jurisdiction of federal courts and U.S. relations with other sovereign nations, including defending Senator William Blount of Tennessee against impeachment.

== Death and legacy ==
Jared Ingersoll died in Philadelphia at age 73; interment was in the Old Pine Street Church Cemetery, Fourth and Pine Streets. Ingersoll was survived by three sons. Two of the sons, Charles Jared Ingersoll and Joseph Reed Ingersoll served as members of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. Ingersoll Street in Madison, Wisconsin, and Liberty ship SS &quot;Jared Ingersoll&quot; are named after him.

<text>In finance, the yield curve is a graph which depicts how the yields on debt instruments – such as bonds – vary as a function of their years remaining to maturity. Typically, the graph&#x27;s horizontal or x-axis is a time line of months or years remaining to maturity, with the shortest maturity on the left and progressively longer time periods on the right. The vertical or y-axis depicts the annualized yield to maturity. 

Those who issue and trade in forms of debt, such as loans and bonds, use yield curves to determine their value. Shifts in the shape and slope of the yield curve are thought to be related to investor expectations for the economy and interest rates. 

Ronald Melicher and Merle Welshans have identified several characteristics of a properly constructed yield curve. It should be based on a set of securities which have differing lengths of time to maturity, and all yields should be calculated as of the same point in time. All securities measured in the yield curve should have similar credit ratings, to screen out the effect of yield differentials caused by credit risk. For this reason, many traders closely watch the yield curve for U.S. Treasury debt securities, which are considered to be risk-free. Informally called &quot;the Treasury yield curve&quot;, it is commonly plotted on a graph such as the one on the right. More formal mathematical descriptions of this relationship are often called the term structure of interest rates.

==Significance of slope and shape==
Yield curves are usually upward sloping asymptotically: the longer the maturity, the higher the yield, with diminishing marginal increases (that is, as one moves to the right, the curve flattens out). The slope of the yield curve can be measured by the difference, or &quot;term spread&quot;, between the yields on two-year and ten-year U.S. Treasury Notes. A wider spread indicates a steeper slope. 

There are two common explanations for upward sloping yield curves. First, it may be that the market is anticipating a rise in the risk-free rate. If investors hold off investing now, they may receive a better rate in the future. Therefore, under the arbitrage pricing theory, investors who are willing to lock their money in now need to be compensated for the anticipated rise in rates—thus the higher interest rate on long-term investments. Another explanation is that longer maturities entail greater risks for the investor (i.e. the lender). A risk premium is needed by the market, since at longer durations there is more uncertainty and a greater chance of events that impact the investment. This explanation depends on the notion that the economy faces more uncertainties in the distant future than in the near term. This effect is referred to as the liquidity spread. If the market expects more volatility in the future, even if interest rates are anticipated to decline, the increase in the risk premium can influence the spread and cause an increasing yield.

The opposite situation can also occur, in which the yield curve is &quot;inverted&quot;, with short-term interest rates higher than long-term. For instance, in November 2004, the yield curve for UK Government bonds was partially inverted. The yield for the 10-year bond stood at 4.68%, but was only 4.45% for the 30-year bond. The market&#x27;s anticipation of falling interest rates causes such incidents. Negative liquidity premiums can also exist if long-term investors dominate the market, but the prevailing view is that a positive liquidity premium dominates, so only the anticipation of falling interest rates will cause an inverted yield curve. Strongly inverted yield curves have historically preceded economic recessions.

The shape of the yield curve is influenced by supply and demand: for instance, if there is a large demand for long bonds, for instance from pension funds to match their fixed liabilities to pensioners, and not enough bonds in existence to meet this demand, then the yields on long bonds can be expected to be low, irrespective of market participants&#x27; views about future events.

The yield curve may also be flat or hump-shaped, due to anticipated interest rates being steady, or short-term volatility outweighing long-term volatility.

Yield curves continually move all the time that the markets are open, reflecting the market&#x27;s reaction to news. A further &quot;stylized fact&quot; is that yield curves tend to move in parallel; i.e.: the yield curve shifts up and down as interest rate levels rise and fall, which is then referred to as a &quot;parallel shift&quot;.

===Types of yield curve===
There is no single yield curve describing the cost of money for everybody. The most important factor in determining a yield curve is the currency in which the securities are denominated. The economic position of the countries and companies using each currency is a primary factor in determining the yield curve. Different institutions borrow money at different rates, depending on their creditworthiness.

The yield curves corresponding to the bonds issued by governments in their own currency are called the government bond yield curve (government curve). Banks with high credit ratings (Aa/AA or above) borrow money from each other at the LIBOR rates. These yield curves are typically a little higher than government curves. They are the most important and widely used in the financial markets, and are known variously as the LIBOR curve or the swap curve. The construction of the swap curve is described below.

Besides the government curve and the LIBOR curve, there are corporate (company) curves. These are constructed from the yields of bonds issued by corporations. Since corporations have less creditworthiness than most governments and most large banks, these yields are typically higher. Corporate yield curves are often quoted in terms of a &quot;credit spread&quot; over the relevant swap curve. For instance the five-year yield curve point for Vodafone might be quoted as LIBOR +0.25%, where 0.25% (often written as 25 basis points or 25) is the credit spread.

====Normal yield curve====

From the post-Great Depression era to the present, the yield curve has usually been &quot;normal&quot; meaning that yields rise as maturity lengthens (i.e., the slope of the yield curve is positive). This positive slope reflects investor expectations for the economy to grow in the future and, importantly, for this growth to be associated with a greater expectation that inflation will rise in the future rather than fall. This expectation of higher inflation leads to expectations that the central bank will tighten monetary policy by raising short-term interest rates in the future to slow economic growth and dampen inflationary pressure. It also creates a need for a risk premium associated with the uncertainty about the future rate of inflation and the risk this poses to the future value of cash flows. Investors price these risks into the yield curve by demanding higher yields for maturities further into the future. In a positively sloped yield curve, lenders profit from the passage of time since yields decrease as bonds get closer to maturity (as yield decreases, price &quot;increases&quot;); this is known as rolldown and is a significant component of profit in fixed-income investing (i.e., buying and selling, not necessarily holding to maturity), particularly if the investing is leveraged.

However, a positively sloped yield curve has not always been the norm. Through much of the 19th century and early 20th century the US economy experienced trend growth with persistent deflation, not inflation. During this period the yield curve was typically inverted, reflecting the fact that deflation made current cash flows less valuable than future cash flows. During this period of persistent deflation, a &#x27;normal&#x27; yield curve was negatively sloped.

====Steep yield curve====
Historically, the 20-year Treasury bond yield has averaged approximately two percentage points above that of three-month Treasury bills. In situations when this gap increases (e.g. 20-year Treasury yield rises much higher than the three-month Treasury yield), the economy is expected to improve quickly in the future. This type of curve can be seen at the beginning of an economic expansion (or after the end of a recession). Here, economic stagnation will have depressed short-term interest rates; however, rates begin to rise once the demand for capital is re-established by growing economic activity.

In January 2010, the gap between yields on two-year Treasury notes and 10-year notes widened to 2.92 percentage points, its highest ever.

====Flat or humped yield curve====

A flat yield curve is observed when all maturities have similar yields, whereas a humped curve results when short-term and long-term yields are equal and medium-term yields are higher than those of the short-term and long-term. A flat curve sends signals of uncertainty in the economy. This mixed signal can revert to a normal curve or could later result into an inverted curve. It cannot be explained by the Segmented Market theory discussed below.

====Inverted yield curve====

Under unusual circumstances, investors will settle for lower yields associated with low-risk long-term debt if they think the economy will enter a recession in the near future. For example, the S&amp;P 500 experienced a dramatic fall in mid 2007, from which it recovered completely by early 2013. Investors who had purchased 10-year Treasuries in 2006 would have received a safe and steady yield until 2015, possibly achieving better returns than those investing in equities during that volatile period.

Economist Campbell Harvey&#x27;s 1986 dissertation showed that an inverted yield curve accurately forecasts U.S. recessions. An inverted curve has indicated a worsening economic situation in the future eight times since 1970.

In addition to potentially signaling an economic decline, inverted yield curves also imply that the market believes inflation will remain low. This is because, even if there is a recession, a low bond yield will still be offset by low inflation. However, technical factors, such as a flight to quality or global economic or currency situations, may cause an increase in demand for bonds on the long end of the yield curve, causing long-term rates to fall. Falling long-term rates in the presence of rising short-term rates is known as &quot;Greenspan&#x27;s Conundrum&quot;.

==Relationship to the business cycle==

The slope of the yield curve is one of the most powerful predictors of future economic growth, inflation, and recessions.
 One measure of the yield curve slope (i.e. the difference between 10-year Treasury bond rate and the 3-month Treasury bond rate) is included in the Financial Stress Index published by the St. Louis Fed. A different measure of the slope (i.e. the difference between 10-year Treasury bond rates and the federal funds rate) is incorporated into the Index of Leading Economic Indicators published by The Conference Board.

An inverted yield curve is often a harbinger of recession. A positively sloped yield curve is often a harbinger of inflationary growth. Work by Arturo Estrella and Tobias Adrian has established the predictive power of an inverted yield curve to signal a recession. Their models show that when the difference between short-term interest rates (they use 3-month T-bills) and long-term interest rates (10-year Treasury bonds) at the end of a federal reserve tightening cycle is negative or less than 93 basis points positive, a rise in unemployment usually occurs. The New York Fed publishes a monthly recession probability prediction derived from the yield curve and based on Estrella&#x27;s work.

All the recessions in the US since 1970 have been preceded by an inverted yield curve (10-year vs 3-month). Over the same time frame, every occurrence of an inverted yield curve has been followed by recession as declared by the NBER business cycle dating committee. The yield curve became inverted in the first half of 2019, for the first time since 2007.

Estrella and others have postulated that the yield curve affects the business cycle via the balance sheet of banks (or bank-like financial institutions). When the yield curve is inverted, banks are often caught paying more on short-term deposits (or other forms of short-term wholesale funding) than they are making on new long-term loans leading to a loss of profitability and reluctance to lend resulting in a credit crunch. When the yield curve is upward sloping, banks can profitably take-in short-term deposits and make new long-term loans so they are eager to supply credit to borrowers. This eventually leads to a credit bubble.

==Theory==
There are three main economic theories attempting to explain how yields vary with maturity. Two of the theories are extreme positions, while the third attempts to find a middle ground between the former two. 

===Market expectations (pure expectations) hypothesis===
This hypothesis assumes that the various maturities are perfect substitutes and suggests that the shape of the yield curve depends on market participants&#x27; expectations of future interest rates. It assumes that market forces will cause the interest rates on various terms of bonds to be such that the expected final value of a sequence of short-term investments will equal the known final value of a single long-term investment. If this did not hold, the theory assumes that investors would quickly demand more of the current short-term or long-term bonds (whichever gives the higher expected long-term yield), and this would drive down the return on current bonds of that term and drive up the yield on current bonds of the other term, so as to quickly make the assumed equality of expected returns of the two investment approaches hold.

Using this, futures rates, along with the assumption that arbitrage opportunities will be minimal in future markets, and that futures rates are unbiased estimates of forthcoming spot rates, provide enough information to construct a complete expected yield curve. For example, if investors have an expectation of what 1-year interest rates will be next year, the current 2-year interest rate can be calculated as the compounding of this year&#x27;s 1-year interest rate by next year&#x27;s expected 1-year interest rate. More generally, returns (1+ yield) on a long-term instrument are assumed to equal the geometric mean of the expected returns on a series of short-term instruments:

: formula_1

where &quot;i&quot;&quot;st&quot; and &quot;i&quot;&quot;lt&quot; are the expected short-term and actual long-term interest rates (but formula_2 is the actual observed short-term rate for the first year).

This theory is consistent with the observation that yields usually move together. However, it fails to explain the persistence in the shape of the yield curve.

Shortcomings of expectations theory include that it neglects the interest rate risk inherent in investing in bonds.

===Liquidity premium theory===
The liquidity premium theory is an offshoot of the pure expectations theory. The liquidity premium theory asserts that long-term interest rates not only reflect investors&#x27; assumptions about future interest rates but also include a premium for holding long-term bonds (investors prefer short-term bonds to long-term bonds), called the term premium or the liquidity premium. This premium compensates investors for the added risk of having their money tied up for a longer period, including the greater price uncertainty. Because of the term premium, long-term bond yields tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward. Long-term yields are also higher not just because of the liquidity premium, but also because of the risk premium added by the risk of default from holding a security over the long term. The market expectations hypothesis is combined with the liquidity premium theory:

: formula_3

where formula_4 is the risk premium associated with an formula_5 year bond.

===Preferred habitat theory===
The preferred habitat theory is a variant of the liquidity premium theory, and states that in addition to interest rate expectations, investors have distinct investment horizons and require a meaningful premium to buy bonds with maturities outside their &quot;preferred&quot; maturity, or habitat. Proponents of this theory believe that short-term investors are more prevalent in the fixed-income market, and therefore longer-term rates tend to be higher than short-term rates, for the most part, but short-term rates can be higher than long-term rates occasionally. This theory is consistent with both the persistence of the normal yield curve shape and the tendency of the yield curve to shift up and down while retaining its shape.

===Market segmentation theory===
This theory is also called the segmented market hypothesis. In this theory, financial instruments of different terms are not substitutable. As a result, the supply and demand in the markets for short-term and long-term instruments is determined largely independently. Prospective investors decide in advance whether they need short-term or long-term instruments. If investors prefer their portfolio to be liquid, they will prefer short-term instruments to long-term instruments. Therefore, the market for short-term instruments will receive a higher demand. Higher demand for the instrument implies higher prices and lower yield. This explains the stylized fact that short-term yields are usually lower than long-term yields. This theory explains the predominance of the normal yield curve shape. However, because the supply and demand of the two markets are independent, this theory fails to explain the observed fact that yields tend to move together (i.e., upward and downward shifts in the curve).

===Historical development of yield curve theory===
On August 15, 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced that the U.S. dollar would no longer be based on the gold standard, thereby ending the Bretton Woods system and initiating the era of floating exchange rates.

Floating exchange rates made life more complicated for bond traders, including those at Salomon Brothers in New York City. Encouraged by Marty Liebowitz, traders began thinking about bond yields in new ways by the middle of the 1970s. Rather than think of each maturity (a ten-year bond, a five-year, etc.) as a separate marketplace, they began drawing a curve through all their yields. The bit nearest the present time became known as the &quot;short end&quot;—yields of bonds further out became, naturally, the &quot;long end&quot;.

Academics had to play catch up with practitioners in this matter. One important theoretic development came from a Czech mathematician, Oldrich Vasicek, who argued in a 1977 paper that bond prices all along the curve are driven by the short end (under risk-neutral equivalent martingale measure) and accordingly by short-term interest rates. The mathematical model for Vasicek&#x27;s work was given by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, but has since been discredited because the model predicts a positive probability that the short rate becomes negative and is inflexible in creating yield curves of different shapes. Vasicek&#x27;s model has been superseded by many different models including the Hull–White model (which allows for time varying parameters in the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process), the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model, which is a modified Bessel process, and the Heath–Jarrow–Morton framework. There are also many modifications to each of these models, but see the article on short-rate model. Another modern approach is the LIBOR market model, introduced by Brace, Gatarek and Musiela in 1997 and advanced by others later. In 1996, a group of derivatives traders led by Olivier Doria (then head of swaps at Deutsche Bank) and Michele Faissola, contributed to an extension of the swap yield curves in all the major European currencies. Until then the market would give prices until 15 years maturities. The team extended the maturity of European yield curves up to 50 years (for the lira, French franc, Deutsche mark, Danish krone and many other currencies including the ecu). This innovation was a major contribution towards the issuance of long dated zero-coupon bonds and the creation of long dated mortgages.

==Construction of the full yield curve from market data==

The usual representation of the yield curve is in terms of a function P, defined on all future times &quot;t&quot;, such that P(&quot;t&quot;) represents the value today of receiving one unit of currency &quot;t&quot; years in the future. If P is defined for all future &quot;t&quot; then we can easily recover the yield (i.e. the annualized interest rate) for borrowing money for that period of time via the formula

:formula_6

The significant difficulty in defining a yield curve therefore is to determine the function P(&quot;t&quot;). P is called the discount factor function or the zero coupon bond.

Yield curves are built from either prices available in the &quot;bond market&quot; or the &quot;money market&quot;. Whilst the yield curves built from the bond market use prices only from a specific class of bonds (for instance bonds issued by the UK government) yield curves built from the money market use prices of &quot;cash&quot; from today&#x27;s LIBOR rates, which determine the &quot;short end&quot; of the curve i.e. for &quot;t&quot; ≤ 3m, interest rate futures which determine the midsection of the curve (3m ≤ &quot;t&quot; ≤ 15m) and interest rate swaps which determine the &quot;long end&quot; (1y ≤ &quot;t&quot; ≤ 60y).

The example given in the table at the right is known as a LIBOR curve because it is constructed using either LIBOR rates or swap rates. A LIBOR curve is the most widely used interest rate curve as it represents the credit worth of private entities at about A+ rating, roughly the equivalent of commercial banks. If one substitutes the LIBOR and swap rates with government bond yields, one arrives at what is known as a government curve, usually considered the risk free interest rate curve for the underlying currency. The spread between the LIBOR (or swap) rate and the government bond yield of similar maturity is usually positive, meaning that private borrowing is at a premium above government borrowing. This spread is a measure of the difference in the risk tolerances of the lenders to the two types of borrowing. For the U. S. market, a common benchmark for such a spread is given by the so-called TED spread.

In either case the available market data provides a matrix &quot;A&quot; of cash flows, each row representing a particular financial instrument and each column representing a point in time. The (&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;)-th element of the matrix represents the amount that instrument &quot;i&quot; will pay out on day &quot;j&quot;. Let the vector &quot;F&quot; represent today&#x27;s prices of the instrument (so that the &quot;i&quot;-th instrument has value &quot;F&quot;(&quot;i&quot;)), then by definition of our discount factor function &quot;P&quot; we should have that &quot;F&quot; = &quot;AP&quot; (this is a matrix multiplication). Actually, noise in the financial markets means it is not possible to find a &quot;P&quot; that solves this equation exactly, and our goal becomes to find a vector &quot;P&quot; such that

: formula_7

where formula_8 is as small a vector as possible (where the size of a vector might be measured by taking its norm, for example).

Even if we can solve this equation, we will only have determined &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) for those &quot;t&quot; which have a cash flow from one or more of the original instruments we are creating the curve from. Values for other &quot;t&quot; are typically determined using some sort of interpolation scheme.

Practitioners and researchers have suggested many ways of solving the A*P = F equation. It transpires that the most natural method – that of minimizing formula_9 by least squares regression – leads to unsatisfactory results. The large number of zeroes in the matrix &quot;A&quot; mean that function &quot;P&quot; turns out to be &quot;bumpy&quot;.

In their comprehensive book on interest rate modelling James and Webber note that the following techniques have been suggested to solve the problem of finding P:

#Approximation using Lagrange polynomials
#Fitting using parameterised curves (such as splines, the Nelson-Siegel family, the Svensson family, the exponential polynomial family or the Cairns restricted-exponential family of curves). Van Deventer, Imai and Mesler summarize three different techniques for curve fitting that satisfy the maximum smoothness of either forward interest rates, zero coupon bond prices, or zero coupon bond yields
#Local regression using kernels
#Linear programming

In the money market practitioners might use different techniques to solve for different areas of the curve. For example, at the short end of the curve, where there are few cashflows, the first few elements of P may be found by bootstrapping from one to the next. At the long end, a regression technique with a cost function that values smoothness might be used.

==Effect on bond prices==

There is a time dimension to the analysis of bond values. A 10-year bond at purchase becomes a 9-year bond a year later, and the year after it becomes an 8-year bond, etc. Each year the bond moves incrementally closer to maturity, resulting in lower volatility and shorter duration and demanding a lower interest rate when the yield curve is rising. Since falling rates create increasing prices, the value of a bond initially will rise as the lower rates of the shorter maturity become its new market rate. Because a bond is always anchored by its final maturity, the price at some point must change direction and fall to par value at redemption.

A bond&#x27;s market value at different times in its life can be calculated. When the yield curve is steep, the bond is predicted to have a large capital gain in the first years before falling in price later. When the yield curve is flat, the capital gain is predicted to be much less, and there is little variability in the bond&#x27;s total returns over time.

As market rates of interest increase or decrease, the impact is rarely the same at each point along the yield curve, i.e. the curve rarely moves up or down in parallel. Because longer-term bonds have a larger duration, a rise in rates will cause a larger capital loss for them, than for short-term bonds. But almost always, the long maturity&#x27;s rate will change much less, flattening the yield curve. The greater change in rates at the short end will offset to some extent the advantage provided by the shorter bond&#x27;s lower duration.

Long duration bonds tend to be mean reverting, meaning that they readily gravitate to a long-run average. The middle of the curve (5–10 years) will see the greatest percentage gain in yields if there is anticipated inflation even if interest rates have not changed. The long-end does not move quite as much percentage-wise because of the mean reverting properties.

The yearly &#x27;total return&#x27; from the bond is a) the sum of the coupon&#x27;s yield plus b) the capital gain from the changing valuation as it slides down the yield curve and c) any capital gain or loss from changing interest rates at that point in the yield curve.

==Notes==
1. The New York Federal Reserve recession prediction model uses the month average 10 year yield vs the month average 3 month bond equivalent yield to compute the term spread. Therefore, intra-day and daily inversions do not count as inversions unless they lead to an inversion on a monthly average basis. In December 2018, portions of the yield curve inverted for the first time since the 2008–2009 recession. However the 10-year vs 3-month portion did not invert until March 22, 2019 and it reverted to a positive slope by April 1, 2019 (i.e. only 8 days later). The month average of the 10-year vs 3-month (bond equivalent yield) difference reached zero basis points in May 2019. Both March and April 2019 had month-average spreads greater than zero basis points despite intra-day and daily inversions in March and April. Therefore, the table shows the 2019 inversion beginning from May 2019. Likewise, daily inversions in September 1998 did not result in negative term spreads on a month average basis and thus do not constitute a false alarm.

2. The recession prediction model stipulated that the recession began in February 2020, one month before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.

<text>Multi-disciplinary design optimization (MDO) is a field of engineering that uses optimization methods to solve design problems incorporating a number of disciplines. It is also known as multidisciplinary system design optimization (MSDO), and multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO).

MDO allows designers to incorporate all relevant disciplines simultaneously. The optimum of the simultaneous problem is superior to the design found by optimizing each discipline sequentially, since it can exploit the interactions between the disciplines. However, including all disciplines simultaneously significantly increases the complexity of the problem.

These techniques have been used in a number of fields, including automobile design, naval architecture, electronics, architecture, computers, and electricity distribution. However, the largest number of applications have been in the field of aerospace engineering, such as aircraft and spacecraft design. For example, the proposed Boeing blended wing body (BWB) aircraft concept has used MDO extensively in the conceptual and preliminary design stages. The disciplines considered in the BWB design are aerodynamics, structural analysis, propulsion, control theory, and economics.

==History==
Traditionally engineering has normally been performed by teams, each with expertise in a specific discipline, such as aerodynamics or structures. Each team would use its members&#x27; experience and judgement to develop a workable design, usually sequentially. For example, the aerodynamics experts would outline the shape of the body, and the structural experts would be expected to fit their design within the shape specified. The goals of the teams were generally performance-related, such as maximum speed, minimum drag, or minimum structural weight.

Between 1970 and 1990, two major developments in the aircraft industry changed the approach of aircraft design engineers to their design problems. The first was computer-aided design, which allowed designers to quickly modify and analyse their designs. The second was changes in the procurement policy of most airlines and military organizations, particularly the military of the United States, from a performance-centred approach to one that emphasized lifecycle cost issues. This led to an increased concentration on economic factors and the attributes known as the &quot;ilities&quot; including manufacturability, reliability, maintainability, etc.

Since 1990, the techniques have expanded to other industries. Globalization has resulted in more distributed, decentralized design teams. The high-performance personal computer has largely replaced the centralized supercomputer and the Internet and local area networks have facilitated sharing of design information. Disciplinary design software in many disciplines (such as OptiStruct or NASTRAN, a finite element analysis program for structural design) have become very mature. In addition, many optimization algorithms, in particular the population-based algorithms, have advanced significantly.

=== Origins in structural optimization ===
Whereas optimization methods are nearly as old as calculus, dating back to Isaac Newton, Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Joseph Louis Lagrange, who used them to solve problems such as the shape of the catenary curve, numerical optimization reached prominence in the digital age. Its systematic application to structural design dates to its advocacy by Schmit in 1960. The success of structural optimization in the 1970s motivated the emergence of multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) in the 1980s. Jaroslaw Sobieski championed decomposition methods specifically designed for MDO applications. The following synopsis focuses on optimization methods for MDO. First, the popular gradient-based methods used by the early structural optimization and MDO community are reviewed. Then those methods developed in the last dozen years are summarized.

=== Gradient-based methods ===
There were two schools of structural optimization practitioners using gradient-based methods during the 1960s and 1970s: optimality criteria and mathematical programming. The optimality criteria school derived recursive formulas based on the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) necessary conditions for an optimal design. The KKT conditions were applied to classes of structural problems such as minimum weight design with constraints on stresses, displacements, buckling, or frequencies [Rozvany, Berke, Venkayya, Khot, et al.] to derive resizing expressions particular to each class. The mathematical programming school employed classical gradient-based methods to structural optimization problems. The method of usable feasible directions, Rosen&#x27;s gradient projection (generalized reduce gradient) method, sequential unconstrained minimization techniques, sequential linear programming and eventually sequential quadratic programming methods were common choices. Schittkowski et al. reviewed the methods current by the early 1990s.

The gradient methods unique to the MDO community derive from the combination of optimality criteria with math programming, first recognized in the seminal work of Fleury and Schmit who constructed a framework of approximation concepts for structural optimization. They recognized that optimality criteria were so successful for stress and displacement constraints, because that approach amounted to solving the dual problem for Lagrange multipliers using linear Taylor series approximations in the reciprocal design space. In combination with other techniques to improve efficiency, such as constraint deletion, regionalization, and design variable linking, they succeeded in uniting the work of both schools. This approximation concepts based approach forms the basis of the optimization modules in modern structural design software.

Approximations for structural optimization were initiated by the reciprocal approximation Schmit and Miura for stress and displacement response functions. Other intermediate variables were employed for plates. Combining linear and reciprocal variables, Starnes and Haftka developed a conservative approximation to improve buckling approximations. Fadel chose an appropriate intermediate design variable for each function based on a gradient matching condition for the previous point. Vanderplaats initiated a second generation of high quality approximations when he developed the force approximation as an intermediate response approximation to improve the approximation of stress constraints. Canfield developed a Rayleigh quotient approximation to improve the accuracy of eigenvalue approximations. Barthelemy and Haftka published a comprehensive review of approximations in 1993.

=== Non-gradient-based methods ===
In recent years, non-gradient-based evolutionary methods including genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and ant colony algorithms came into existence. At present, many researchers are striving to arrive at a consensus regarding the best modes and methods for complex problems like impact damage, dynamic failure, and real-time analyses. For this purpose, researchers often employ multiobjective and multicriteria design methods.

=== Recent MDO methods ===
MDO practitioners have investigated optimization methods in several broad areas in the last dozen years. These include decomposition methods, approximation methods, evolutionary algorithms, memetic algorithms, response surface methodology, reliability-based optimization, and multi-objective optimization approaches.

The exploration of decomposition methods has continued in the last dozen years with the development and comparison of a number of approaches, classified variously as hierarchic and non hierarchic, or collaborative and non collaborative. 
Approximation methods spanned a diverse set of approaches, including the development of approximations based on surrogate models (often referred to as metamodels), variable fidelity models, and trust region management strategies. The development of multipoint approximations blurred the distinction with response surface methods. Some of the most popular methods include Kriging and the moving least squares method.

Response surface methodology, developed extensively by the statistical community, received much attention in the MDO community in the last dozen years. A driving force for their use has been the development of massively parallel systems for high performance computing, which are naturally suited to distributing the function evaluations from multiple disciplines that are required for the construction of response surfaces. Distributed processing is particularly suited to the design process of complex systems in which analysis of different disciplines may be accomplished naturally on different computing platforms and even by different teams.

Evolutionary methods led the way in the exploration of non-gradient methods for MDO applications. They also have benefited from the availability of massively parallel high performance computers, since they inherently require many more function evaluations than gradient-based methods. Their primary benefit lies in their ability to handle discrete design variables and the potential to find globally optimal solutions.

Reliability-based optimization (RBO) is a growing area of interest in MDO. Like response surface methods and evolutionary algorithms, RBO benefits from parallel computation, because the numeric integration to calculate the probability of failure requires many function evaluations. One of the first approaches employed approximation concepts to integrate the probability of failure. The classical first-order reliability method (FORM) and second-order reliability method (SORM) are still popular. Professor Ramana Grandhi used appropriate normalized variables about the most probable point of failure, found by a two-point adaptive nonlinear approximation to improve the accuracy and efficiency. Southwest Research Institute has figured prominently in the development of RBO, implementing state-of-the-art reliability methods in commercial software. RBO has reached sufficient maturity to appear in commercial structural analysis programs like Altair&#x27;s Optistruct and MSC&#x27;s Nastran.

Utility-based probability maximization was developed in response to some logical concerns (e.g., Blau&#x27;s Dilemma) with reliability-based design optimization. This approach focuses on maximizing the joint probability of both the objective function exceeding some value and of all the constraints being satisfied. When there is no objective function, utility-based probability maximization reduces to a probability-maximization problem. When there are no uncertainties in the constraints, it reduces to a constrained utility-maximization problem. (This second equivalence arises because the utility of a function can always be written as the probability of that function exceeding some random variable). Because it changes the constrained optimization problem associated with reliability-based optimization into an unconstrained optimization problem, it often leads to computationally more tractable problem formulations.

In the marketing field there is a huge literature about optimal design for multiattribute products and services, based on experimental analysis to estimate models of consumers&#x27; utility functions. These methods are known as Conjoint Analysis. Respondents are presented with alternative products, measuring preferences about the alternatives using a variety of scales and the utility function is estimated with different methods (varying from regression and surface response methods to choice models). The best design is formulated after estimating the model. The experimental design is usually optimized to minimize the variance of the estimators. These methods are widely used in practice.

==Problem formulation==
Problem formulation is normally the most difficult part of the process. It is the selection of design variables, constraints, objectives, and models of the disciplines. A further consideration is the strength and breadth of the interdisciplinary coupling in the problem.

===Design variables===
A design variable is a specification that is controllable from the point of view of the designer. For instance, the thickness of a structural member can be considered a design variable. Another might be the choice of material. Design variables can be continuous (such as a wing span), discrete (such as the number of ribs in a wing), or Boolean (such as whether to build a monoplane or a biplane). Design problems with continuous variables are normally solved more easily.

Design variables are often bounded, that is, they often have maximum and minimum values. Depending on the solution method, these bounds can be treated as constraints or separately.

One of the important variables that needs to be accounted is an uncertainty. Uncertainty, often referred to as epistemic uncertainty, arises due to lack of knowledge or incomplete information. Uncertainty is essentially unknown variable but it may causes the failure of system.

===Constraints===
A constraint is a condition that must be satisfied in order for the design to be feasible. An example of a constraint in aircraft design is that the lift generated by a wing must be equal to the weight of the aircraft. In addition to physical laws, constraints can reflect resource limitations, user requirements, or bounds on the validity of the analysis models. Constraints can be used explicitly by the solution algorithm or can be incorporated into the objective using Lagrange multipliers.

===Objectives===
An objective is a numerical value that is to be maximized or minimized. For example, a designer may wish to maximize profit or minimize weight. Many solution methods work only with single objectives. When using these methods, the designer normally weights the various objectives and sums them to form a single objective. Other methods allow multiobjective optimization, such as the calculation of a Pareto front.

===Models===
The designer must also choose models to relate the constraints and the objectives to the design variables. These models are dependent on the discipline involved. They may be empirical models, such as a regression analysis of aircraft prices, theoretical models, such as from computational fluid dynamics, or reduced-order models of either of these. In choosing the models the designer must trade off fidelity with analysis time.

The multidisciplinary nature of most design problems complicates model choice and implementation. Often several iterations are necessary between the disciplines in order to find the values of the objectives and constraints. As an example, the aerodynamic loads on a wing affect the structural deformation of the wing. The structural deformation in turn changes the shape of the wing and the aerodynamic loads. Therefore, in analysing a wing, the aerodynamic and structural analyses must be run a number of times in turn until the loads and deformation converge.

===Standard form===
Once the design variables, constraints, objectives, and the relationships between them have been chosen, the problem can be expressed in the following form:

: find formula_1 that minimizes formula_2 subject to formula_3, formula_4 and formula_5

where formula_6 is an objective, formula_1 is a vector of design variables, formula_8 is a vector of inequality constraints, formula_9 is a vector of equality constraints, and formula_10 and formula_11 are vectors of lower and upper bounds on the design variables. Maximization problems can be converted to minimization problems by multiplying the objective by -1. Constraints can be reversed in a similar manner. Equality constraints can be replaced by two inequality constraints.

==Problem solution==
The problem is normally solved using appropriate techniques from the field of optimization. These include gradient-based algorithms, population-based algorithms, or others. Very simple problems can sometimes be expressed linearly; in that case the techniques of linear programming are applicable.

===Gradient-based methods===
*Adjoint equation
*Newton&#x27;s method
*Steepest descent
*Conjugate gradient
*Sequential quadratic programming

===Gradient-free methods===
* Hooke-Jeeves pattern search
* Nelder-Mead method

===Population-based methods===
*Genetic algorithm
*Memetic algorithm
*Particle swarm optimization
*Harmony search
*ODMA

===Other methods===
*Random search
*Grid search
*Simulated annealing
*Direct search
*IOSO (Indirect Optimization based on Self-Organization)

Most of these techniques require large numbers of evaluations of the objectives and the constraints. The disciplinary models are often very complex and can take significant amounts of time for a single evaluation. The solution can therefore be extremely time-consuming. Many of the optimization techniques are adaptable to parallel computing. Much current research is focused on methods of decreasing the required time.

Also, no existing solution method is guaranteed to find the global optimum of a general problem (see No free lunch in search and optimization). Gradient-based methods find local optima with high reliability but are normally unable to escape a local optimum. Stochastic methods, like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, will find a good solution with high probability, but very little can be said about the mathematical properties of the solution. It is not guaranteed to even be a local optimum. These methods often find a different design each time they are run.

<text>The Present and the Past (1953) is a novel by Ivy Compton-Burnett. It follows the head of a family who, although outwardly powerful and in charge, is suffering under the fact that he is being belittled and at some point even outright ignored by family and servants alike.

==Plot introduction==
After five years of marriage, Cassius Clare and his wife Catherine cannot bear each other any longer and decide to get a divorce. Although the separation is basically amicable, it is Cassius Clare&#x27;s condition that Catherine leave their two sons—Fabian, aged four, and Guy, aged two—under his custody and never see them again. Catherine Claire accepts, and for the next nine years disappears from their life.

==Plot summary==
When the novel opens Catherine has decided she can bear it no longer not to see her boys. Openly confessing that she is breaking her promise, she announces that she would like a reunion. In the meantime, Cassius Clare has remarried and has had three more children by the second Mrs Clare: eight-year-old Henry, seven-year-old Megan, and Tobias, aged three. With the help of a head nurse, a nursemaid, and a governess, Flavia Clare has been a perfect mother to all five children, never drawing a line between her own flesh and blood and the two oldest children by her husband&#x27;s first marriage. But when Fabian and Guy learn about their natural mother&#x27;s plans, the biological bond proves to be stronger than any care that could be given them by their stepmother, and they want to meet her. Cassius Clare, in an awkward position of wanting to please each member of his family, agrees to Catherine&#x27;s wish, although right from the start it is clear to all members of the family that she will want to see her two sons on a regular basis once the first meeting has taken place.

To Cassius Clare&#x27;s dismay, the two women get on astonishingly well with each other. Seemingly without a job which demands his time and attention, Clare feels neglected and soon starts pitying himself. This feeling is enhanced when, casually conversing with his sons, he realises that they do not think highly of him either. For example, asked to say which people he likes best, 13-year-old Fabian comes up with the following list: (1) Catherine, his biological mother; (2) Guy, his brother; and (3) Flavia (whom he calls &quot;Mater&quot;), his stepmother—with his father altogether absent from the list. Similarly, three-year-old Tobias&#x27;s favourites turn out to be Catherine, Bennet, the head nurse; his sister Megan; and William, the middle-aged gardener.

It seems Cassius Clare takes these pronouncements very seriously, in spite of their being uttered by children. His only comfort is his father, a man of over 70 who has moved in with his son&#x27;s family after his wife&#x27;s death and who is just waiting for his own. The one other person who seems to be close to him is Alfred Ainger, the 40-year-old butler. Clare actually discusses with his father how the family might react if he committed suicide and how the natural order of things would be turned upside down if he died before his own father.

It never becomes quite clear whether this conversation is meant to be a cry for help. When people keep paying no attention whatsoever to him, Cassius Clare takes his father&#x27;s pills, ten of which taken together constitute a lethal dose. Clare, however, as a sort of &quot;compromise&quot;, takes only four tablets, thus deceiving his family, who think he has really tried to kill himself. A doctor is called for, but he cannot do anything about Clare&#x27;s condition: the patient just has to wait until the effects of the drug wear off.

Cassius Clare considers his scheme to have been at least partly successful when, unexpectedly, Tobias finds the phial with the remaining tablets, and, as there are more of them left than he has claimed, Clare&#x27;s &quot;deceit&quot; is discovered. Everybody, including the servants, are embarrassed that the head of the family is both weak and a liar, and after Clare&#x27;s speedy recovery he is appalled to find out that he is still not given the amount of love and attention he thinks he is entitled.

When, obviously only a few days later, Ainger finds him lying on the sofa in very much the same manner as during his faked suicide attempt, the butler does not do anything about it: he neither calls the doctor, nor does he inform Flavia about her husband&#x27;s state. When the family eventually do start worrying about Clare&#x27;s health the latter is already dead: now it turns out that, at the age of 52, he has had a heart attack (or something like that), that his life could have been saved but that he has just been left dying without any help.

The remaining family members now realise that far-reaching changes will have to be made. Although they do not blame each other or themselves for Clare&#x27;s death, they all agree that the two women could not possibly go on living under the same roof and raising their five children together. Catherine is prepared to leave the house for good, but on condition that she can take her two sons with her if they wish to go. When Catherine puts the question to them, it is Fabian who spontaneously decides to go with his biological mother. Guy, on the other hand, would not want to leave &quot;Mater&quot;, but his relationship to his older brother proves to be the stronger, and so he makes up his mind to go with him.

==Quotes==
*&quot;It is so dignified to suffer.&quot; &quot;But not to cause suffering.&quot;
*&quot;Do we do everything for our own advantage?&quot; &quot;Yes, I think we do. No one else does anything for it. So it takes all our time to get enough done.&quot;
*&quot;Perhaps that is the difference between a bad person and a good; that the one reveals himself, and the other has the proper feeling to hide it.&quot;
*&quot;It is easier to face death than to face life.&quot;

<doc id="547749" wikidata="Q3239315" url="?curid=547749" title="Fixed income">
<text>Fixed income refers to any type of investment under which the borrower or issuer is obliged to make payments of a fixed amount on a fixed schedule. For example, the borrower may have to pay interest at a fixed rate once a year and repay the principal amount on maturity. Fixed-income securities (more commonly known as bonds) can be contrasted with equity securities (often referred to as stocks and shares) that create no obligation to pay dividends or any other form of income. Bonds carry a level of legal protections for investors that equity securities do not: in the event of a bankruptcy, bond holders would be repaid after liquidation of assets, whereas shareholders with stock often receive nothing.

For a company to grow its business, it often must raise money – for example, to finance an acquisition; buy equipment or land, or invest in new product development. The terms on which investors will finance the company will depend on the risk profile of the company. The company can give up equity by issuing stock or can promise to pay regular interest and repay the principal on the loan (bonds or bank loans). Fixed-income securities also trade differently than equities. Whereas equities, such as common stock, trade on exchanges or other established trading venues, many fixed-income securities trade over-the-counter on a principal basis.

The term &quot;fixed&quot; in &quot;fixed income&quot; refers to both the schedule of obligatory payments and the amount. &quot;Fixed income securities&quot; can be distinguished from inflation-indexed bonds, variable-interest rate notes, and the like. If an issuer misses a payment on fixed income security, the issuer is in default, and depending on the relevant law and the structure of the security, the payees may be able to force the issuer into bankruptcy. In contrast, if a company misses a quarterly dividend to stock (non-fixed-income) shareholders, there is no violation of any payment covenant and no default.

The term &quot;fixed income&quot; is also applied to a person&#x27;s income that does not vary materially over time. This can include income derived from any combination of (1) fixed-income investments such as bonds and preferred stocks or (2) pensions that guarantee a fixed income (defined benefit as contrasted with defined contribution). When pensioners or retirees are dependent on their pension (whether a private-sector one, a public-sector one, or both) as their dominant source of income, the term &quot;fixed income&quot; can also imply that they have relatively limited discretionary income or have little financial freedom to make large or discretionary expenditures.

==Types of borrowers==
Governments issue government bonds in their own currency and sovereign bonds in foreign currencies. State and local governments issue municipal bonds to finance projects or other major spending initiatives. Debt issued by government-backed agencies is called an agency bond. Companies can issue a corporate bond or obtain money from a bank through a corporate loan. Preferred stocks share some of the characteristics of fixed interest bonds. Securitized bank lending (e.g. credit card debt, car loans or mortgages) can be structured into other types of fixed income products such as ABS – asset-backed securities which can be traded over-the-counter just like corporate and government bonds.

==Terminology==
Some of the terminology used in connection with these investments is:

*The issuer is the entity (company or government) who borrows the money by issuing the bond, and is due to pay interest and repay capital in due course.
*The principal of a bond – also known as maturity value, face value, par value – is the amount that the issuer borrows which must be repaid to the lender.
*The coupon (of a bond) is the annual interest that the issuer must pay, expressed as a percentage of the principal.
*The maturity is the end of the bond, the date that the issuer must return the principal.
*The issue is another term for the bond itself.
*The indenture, in some cases, is the contract that states all of the terms of the bond.

==Investors==
Investors in fixed-income securities are typically looking for a constant and secure return on their investment. For example, a retired person might like to receive a regular dependable payment to live on like gratuity, but not consume principal. This person can buy a bond with their money and use the coupon payment (the interest) as that regular dependable payment. When the bond matures or is refinanced, the person will have their money returned to them. The major investors in fixed-income securities are institutional investors, such as pension plans, mutual funds, hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, insurance companies and others.

==Pricing factors==
The main number which is used to assess the value of the bond is the gross redemption yield. This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the gross redemption yield (gross means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a gross redemption yield of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a gross redemption yield of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.

In buying a bond, one is buying a set of cash flows, which are discounted according to the buyer&#x27;s perception of how interest and exchange rates will move over its life.

Supply and demand affect prices, especially in the case of market participants who are constrained in the investments they make. Insurance companies and pension funds usually have long term liabilities that they wish to hedge, which requires low risk, predictable cash flows, such as long dated government bonds.

Some fixed-income securities, such as mortgage-backed securities, have unique characteristics, such as prepayments, which impact their pricing.

==Inflation-linked bonds==
There are also inflation-indexed bonds—fixed-income securities linked to a specific price index. The most common examples are US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and UK Index Linked Gilts. The interest and principal repayments under this type of bond are adjusted in line with a Consumer Price Index (in the US this is the CPI-U for urban consumers). This means that these bonds are guaranteed to outperform the inflation rate (unless (a) the market price has increased so that the &quot;real&quot; yield is negative, which is the case in 2012 for many such UK bonds, or (b) the government or other issuer defaults on the bond). This allows investors of all types to preserve the purchasing power of their money even at times of high inflation. For example, assuming 3.88% inflation over the course of one year (just about the 56 year average inflation rate, through most of 2006), and a real yield of 2.61% (the fixed US Treasury real yield on October 19, 2006, for a 5 yr TIPS), the adjusted principal of the fixed income would rise from 100 to 103.88 and then the real yield would be applied to the adjusted principal, meaning 103.88 x 1.0261, which equals 106.5913; giving a total return of 6.5913%. TIPS moderately outperform conventional US Treasuries, which yielded just 5.05% for a one-year bill on October 19, 2006.

==Derivatives==
Fixed income derivatives include interest rate derivatives and credit derivatives. Often inflation derivatives are also included into this definition. There is a wide range of fixed income derivative products: options, swaps, futures contracts as well as forward contracts. The most widely traded kinds are:
* Credit default swaps
* Interest rate swaps
* Inflation swaps
* Bond futures on 2/10/30-year government bonds
* Interest rate futures on 90-day interbank interest rates
* Forward rate agreements

==Risks==
Fixed income securities have risks that may include but are not limited to the following, many of which are synonymous, mutually exclusive, or related:
* inflation risk – that the buying power of the principal and interest payments will decline during the term of the security
* interest rate risk – that overall interest rates will change from the levels available when the security is sold, causing an opportunity cost
* currency risk – that exchange rates with other currencies will change during the security&#x27;s term, causing loss of buying power in other countries
* default risk – that the issuer will be unable to pay the scheduled interest payments or principal repayment due to financial hardship or otherwise
* reinvestment risk – that the purchaser will be unable to purchase another security of similar return upon the expiration of the current security
* liquidity risk – that the buyer will require the principal funds for another purpose on short notice, prior to the expiration of the security, and be unable to exchange the security for cash in the required time period without loss of fair value
* call risk - that the issuer will redeem or call back a fixed-income security before its maturity date, which can result in the investor receiving the principal earlier than expected and potentially at a lower interest rate or price
* duration risk
* convexity risk
* credit quality risk
* political risk – that governmental actions will cause the owner to lose the benefits of the security
* tax adjustment risk
* market risk – the risk of market-wide changes affecting the value of the security
* event risk – the risk that externalities will cause the owner to lose the benefits of the security

<doc id="547750" wikidata="Q5933738" url="?curid=547750" title="Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer">
<text>The Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer is the Hugo Award given each year for writers of works related to science fiction or fantasy which appeared in low- or non-paying publications such as semiprozines or fanzines or in generally available electronic media during the previous calendar year. There is no restriction that the writer is not also a professional author, and several such authors have won the award for their non-paying works. The award was first presented in 1967 and has been awarded annually.

During the 66 regular and retro nomination years, 113 writers have been nominated; 28 of these have won, including ties. David Langford has received the largest number of awards, with 21 wins out of 31 nominations. He was nominated every year from 1979 through 2009, and won 19 times in a row from 1989 through 2007. The other writers to win more than once are Richard E. Geis, with seven wins out of sixteen nominations; Mike Glyer, with four wins out of twenty-five nominations; Susan Wood Glicksohn, with three of eight; Harry Warner, Jr., with two out of nine; Wilson Tucker, with two out of nine; Bob Shaw, who won both times he was nominated; Forrest J Ackerman, with three out of five Retro Hugos; and Ray Bradbury, who won both Retro Hugos he was nominated for. The writers with the most nominations without winning are Evelyn C. Leeper, who was nominated twelve times in a row from 1990 through 2001, and Steven H Silver, whose twelve nominations span 2000–2013.

==History==
The Hugo Awards are presented every year by the World Science Fiction Society for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after Hugo Gernsback, the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, and was once officially known as the Science Fiction Achievement Award. The award has been described as &quot;a fine showcase for speculative fiction&quot; and &quot;the best known literary award for science fiction writing&quot;. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given. To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954, and the fan writer award has been given each time.

Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention, or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year&#x27;s Worldcon is held. Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations. Worldcons are generally held near Labor Day, and in a different city around the world each year.

== Winners and nominees ==

In the following tables, the years correspond to the date of the ceremony. Writers are eligible based on their work of the previous calendar year. Entries with a yellow background and an asterisk (*) next to the writer&#x27;s name have won the award; those with a gray background are the nominees on the short-list. In some years writers who received sufficient nominations to be listed on the ballot declined; these are marked as withdrawn in the entry and are not listed on the main Hugo Award site.

=== Retro Hugos ===
Beginning with the 1996 Worldcon, the World Science Fiction Society created the concept of &quot;Retro Hugos&quot;, in which the Hugo award could be retroactively awarded for 50, 75, or 100 years prior. Retro Hugos may only be awarded for years in which a Worldcon was hosted, but no awards were originally given. Retro Hugos have been awarded eight times, for 1939, 1941, 1943–1946, 1951, and 1954.

<doc id="547757" wikidata="Q1318051" url="?curid=547757" title="Reform Act 1867">
<text>The Representation of the People Act 1867 (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 102), known as the Reform Act 1867 or the Second Reform Act, is an act of the British Parliament that enfranchised part of the urban male working class in England and Wales for the first time, extending the franchise from landowners of freehold property above a certain value, to leaseholders and rental tenants as well. It took effect in stages over the next two years, culminating in full commencement on 1 January 1869.

Before the act, one million of the seven million adult men in England and Wales could vote; the act immediately doubled that number. Further, by the end of 1868 all male heads of household could vote, having abolished the widespread mechanism of the deemed rentpayer or ratepayer being a superior lessor or landlord who would act as middleman for the money paid (&quot;compounding&quot;). The act introduced a near-negligible redistribution of seats, far short of the urbanisation and population growth since 1832.

The overall intent was to help the Conservative Party, Benjamin Disraeli expecting a reward for his sudden and sweeping backing of the reforms discussed, yet it resulted in their loss of the 1868 general election.

==Background==
For the decades after the Reform Act 1832 (the First Reform Act), cabinets (in that era leading from both Houses) had resisted attempts to push through further reform, and in particular left unfulfilled the six demands of the Chartist movement. After 1848, this movement declined rapidly, but elite opinion began to pay attention. It was thus only 27 years after the initial, quite modest, Great Reform Act 1832 that leading politicians thought it prudent to introduce further electoral reform. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Benjamin Disraeli to introduce a reform bill in 1859, Lord John Russell, who had played a major role in passing the Reform Act 1832, attempted this in 1860; but the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, a fellow Liberal, was against any further electoral reform.

The Union victory in the American Civil War in 1865 emboldened the forces in Britain that demanded more democracy and public input into the political system, to the dismay of the upper class landed gentry who identified with the US Southern States planters and feared the loss of influence and a popular radical movement. Influential commentators included Walter Bagehot, Thomas Carlyle, Anthony Trollope, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill. Proponents used two arguments: the balance of the constitution and &quot;moral right&quot;. They emphasized that deserving, skilled, sober, thrifty, and deferential artisans deserve the franchise. Liberal William Gladstone emphasized the &quot;moral&quot; improvement of workingmen and felt that they should therefore have the opportunity of &quot;demonstrating their allegiance to their betters&quot;. However the opposition warned against the low-class democracy of the United States and Australia.

Palmerston&#x27;s death in 1865 opened the floodgates for reform. In 1866 Russell (Earl Russell as he had been since 1861, and now Prime Minister for the second time), introduced a Reform Bill. It was a cautious bill, which proposed to enfranchise &quot;respectable&quot; working men, excluding unskilled workers and what was known as the &quot;residuum&quot;, those that the MPs of the time described as feckless and criminal poor. This was ensured by a £7 annual rent qualification to vote—or 2 shillings and 9 pence (2s 9d) a week. This entailed two &quot;fancy franchises&quot;, emulating measures of 1854, a £10 lodger qualification for the boroughs, and a £50 savings qualification in the counties. Liberals claimed that &quot;the middle classes, strengthened by the best of the artisans, would still have the preponderance of power&quot;.

When it came to the vote, however, this bill split the Liberal Party: a split partly engineered by Benjamin Disraeli, who incited those threatened by the bill to rise up against it. On one side were the reactionary conservative Liberals, known as the Adullamites; on the other were pro-reform Liberals who supported the Government. The Adullamites were supported by Tories and the liberal Whigs were supported by radicals and reformists.

The bill was thus defeated and the Liberal government of Russell resigned.

==Birth of the act==

The Conservatives formed a ministry on 26 June 1866, led by Lord Derby as Prime Minister and Disraeli as Chancellor of the Exchequer. They were faced with the challenge of reviving Conservatism: Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, the powerful Liberal leader, was dead and the Liberal Party was split and defeated. Thanks to manoeuvring by Disraeli, Derby&#x27;s Conservatives saw an opportunity to be a strong, viable party of government; however, there was still a Liberal majority in the House of Commons.

The Adullamites, led by Robert Lowe, had already been working closely with the Conservative Party. The Adullamites were anti-reform, as were the Conservatives, but the Adullamites declined the invitation to enter into Government with the Conservatives as they thought that they could have more influence from an independent position. Despite the fact that he had blocked the Liberal Reform Bill, in February 1867, Disraeli introduced his own Reform Bill into the House of Commons.

By this time the attitude of many in the country had ceased to be apathetic regarding reform of the House of Commons. Huge meetings, especially the ‘Hyde Park riots&#x27;, and the feeling that many of the skilled working class were respectable, had persuaded many that there should be a Reform Bill. However, wealthy Conservative MP Lord Cranborne resigned his government ministry in disgust at the bill&#x27;s introduction.

The Reform League, agitating for universal suffrage, became much more active, and organized demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people in Manchester, Glasgow, and other towns. Though these movements did not normally use revolutionary language as some Chartists had in the 1840s, they were powerful movements. The high point came when a demonstration in May 1867 in Hyde Park was banned by the government. Thousands of troops and policemen were prepared, but the crowds were so huge that the government did not dare to attack. The Home Secretary, Spencer Walpole, was forced to resign.
Faced with the possibility of popular revolt going much further, the government rapidly included into the bill amendments which enfranchised far more people. Consequently, the bill was more far-reaching than any Members of Parliament had thought possible or really wanted; Disraeli appeared to accept most reform proposals, so long as they did not come from William Ewart Gladstone. An amendment tabled by the opposition (but not by Gladstone himself) trebled the new number entitled to vote under the bill; yet Disraeli simply accepted it. The bill enfranchised most men who lived in urban areas. The final proposals were as follows: a borough franchise for all who paid rates in person (that is, not compounders), men who paid more than £10 rent per year, and extra votes for graduates, professionals and those with over £50 savings. These last &quot;fancy franchises&quot; were seen by Conservatives as a weapon against a mass electorate.

However, Gladstone attacked the bill; a series of sparkling parliamentary debates with Disraeli resulted in the bill becoming much more radical. Having been given his chance by the belief that Gladstone&#x27;s bill had gone too far in 1866, Disraeli had now gone further.

Disraeli was able to persuade his party to vote for the bill on the basis that the newly enfranchised electorate would be grateful and would vote Conservative at the next election. Despite this prediction, in 1868 the Conservatives lost the first general election in which the newly enfranchised electors voted.

The bill ultimately aided the rise of the radical wing of the Liberal Party and helped Gladstone to victory. The Act was tidied up with many further Acts to alter electoral boundaries.

==Provisions of the act==
=== Reduced representation ===

==== Disenfranchised boroughs ====
Four electoral boroughs were disenfranchised by the act, for corruption, their last number of MPs shown as blocks:

*Totnes, Devon ■■
*Great Yarmouth, Norfolk ■■
*Lancaster, Lancashire ■■
*Reigate, Surrey ■

Seven English boroughs were disenfranchised by the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868 the next year, their last number of MPs shown as blocks:

*Arundel, Sussex ■
*Ashburton, Devon ■
*Dartmouth, Devon ■
*Honiton, Devon ■■
*Lyme Regis, Dorset ■
*Thetford, Norfolk ■■
*Wells, Somerset ■■

==== Halved representation ====
The following boroughs were reduced from electing two MPs to one:
*Andover, Hampshire
*Bodmin, Cornwall
*Bridgnorth, Shropshire
*Bridport, Dorset
*Buckingham, Buckinghamshire
*Chichester, Sussex
*Chippenham, Wiltshire
*Cirencester, Gloucestershire
*Cockermouth, Cumberland
*Devizes, Wiltshire
*Dorchester, Dorset
*Evesham, Worcestershire
*Guildford, Surrey
*Harwich, Essex
*Hertford, Hertfordshire
*Huntingdon, Huntingdonshire
*Knaresborough, West Riding of Yorkshire
*Leominster, Herefordshire
*Lewes, Sussex
*Lichfield, Staffordshire
*Ludlow, Shropshire
*Lymington, Hampshire
*Maldon, Essex
*Marlow, Buckinghamshire
*Malton, North Riding of Yorkshire
*Marlborough, Wiltshire
*Newport, Isle of Wight
*Poole, Dorset
*Richmond, North Riding of Yorkshire
*Ripon, West Riding of Yorkshire
*Stamford, Lincolnshire
*Tavistock, Devon
*Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire
*Windsor, Berkshire
*Wycombe, Buckinghamshire

Three further boroughs (Honiton, Thetford, Wells) were also due to have their representation halved under the 1867 Act, but before this reduction took effect they were disenfranchised altogether by the 1868 Scottish Reform Act as noted above.

=== Enfranchisements ===
The Act created nine new single-member borough seats:
*Burnley, Lancashire
*Darlington, County Durham
*Dewsbury, West Riding of Yorkshire
*Gravesend, Kent
*Hartlepool, County Durham
*Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire
*Stalybridge, Cheshire
*Stockton, County Durham
*Wednesbury, Staffordshire

The following two boroughs were enfranchised with two MPs:
*Chelsea, Middlesex
*Hackney, Middlesex

The following two were enlarged:
*Salford and Merthyr Tydfil were given two MPs, up from one.
*Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester now had three MPs, up from two.

=== Other changes ===
*The West Riding of Yorkshire divided into three districts each returning two MPs.
*Cheshire, Derbyshire, Devonshire, Essex, Kent, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Somerset, Staffordshire and Surrey divided into three districts instead of two, each returning two MPs.
*Lancashire divided into four two-member districts instead of a three-member district and a two-member district.
*University of London was given one seat.
*Parliament was allowed to continue sitting through a Demise of the Crown.
*MPs exempted from having to seek re-election upon changing offices.

== Reforms in Scotland and Ireland ==

The reforms for Scotland and Ireland were carried out by two subsequent acts, the Representation of the People (Ireland) Act 1868 and the Representation of the People (Scotland) Act 1868.

In Scotland, five existing constituencies gained members, and three new constituencies were formed. Two existing county constituencies were merged into one, giving an overall increase of seven members; this was offset by seven English boroughs (listed above) being disenfranchised, leaving the House with the same number of members.

The representation of Ireland remained unchanged.

== Effects ==
=== Direct effects of the Act ===
The slur of local bribery and corruption dogged early debates in 1867–68. The whips&#x27; and leaders&#x27; decision to steer away discussion of electoral malpractice or irregularity to 1868&#x27;s Election Petitions Act facilitated the progress of the main Reform Act.

The unprecedented extension of the franchise to all householders effectively gave the vote to many working-class men, quite a considerable change. Jonathan Parry described this as a &quot;borough franchise revolution&quot;; Overwhelming election of the landed class or otherwise very wealthy to the Commons would no longer be assured by money, bribery and favours, those elected would reflect the most common sentiment of local units of the public. The brand-new franchise provisions were briefly flawed; the act did not address the issues of compounding and of not being a ratepayer in a household. Compounding (counting of one&#x27;s under-tenants payments and using that count as a qualification) as to all rates and rents was made illegal, abolished in the enactment of a bill tabled by Liberal Grosvenor Hodgkinson. This meant that all male tenants would have to pay the parish/local rates directly and thus thereafter qualified for the vote.

A 2022 study found that the Act reduced political violence in the UK.

===Unintended effects===
* Increased amounts of party spending and political organisation at both a local and national level—politicians had to account themselves to the increased electorate, which without secret ballots meant an increased number of voters to treat or bribe.
* The redistribution of seats actually served to make the House of Commons increasingly dominated by the upper classes. Only they could afford to pay the huge campaigning costs and the abolition of certain rotten boroughs removed some of the middle-class international merchants who had been able to obtain seats.
The Liberal Party was worried about the prospect of a socialist party taking the bulk of the working-class vote, so they moved to the left, while their rivals the Conservatives initiated occasional intrigues to encourage socialist candidates to stand against the Liberals.

==Reform Act in literature==
Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s essay &quot;Shooting Niagara: And After?&quot; compares the Second Reform Act and democracy generally to plunging over Niagara Falls. His essay provoked a response from Mark Twain, &quot;A Day at Niagara&quot; (1869). Trollope&#x27;s &quot;Phineas Finn&quot; is concerned almost exclusively with the parliamentary progress of the Second Reform Act, and Finn sits for one of the seven fictional boroughs that are due to be disenfranchised.

<doc id="547760" wikidata="Q78578" url="?curid=547760" title="Archduke Eugen of Austria">
<text>Archduke Eugen Ferdinand Pius Bernhard Felix Maria of Austria-Teschen (21 May 1863 – 30 December 1954) was an Archduke of Austria and a Prince of Hungary and Bohemia. He was the last Grand Master of the Teutonic Order from the Habsburg dynasty.

==Early life==
Eugen was the son of Archduke Karl Ferdinand of Austria (son of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen) and of his wife Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria. He was born at the castle of Gross Seelowitz in Moravia (today Židlochovice near Brno in the Czech Republic). At his baptism he was given the names &quot;Eugen Ferdinand Pius Bernhard Felix Maria&quot;. His education was Spartan in character. His country living at Gross Seelowitz and holidays at Gmund alternated with a sound education and strict instruction.

At the Palais Erzherzog Albrecht (Archduke Albrecht&#x27;s Palace, also known as the Albrechtspalais) in Vienna, Eugen received instruction in all the military subjects in addition to languages, music and the history of art. At the age of 14 in keeping with the family tradition and like his elder brother Friedrich, he also began his military career with the Tyrolean Kaiserjäger Regiment and was commissioned as a Leutnant on 27 October 1877. Shortly thereafter he was transferred as an Oberleutnant to a hussar regiment and in the following years participated in many lengthy manoeuvres.

In 1882, Eugen took an examination before a commission assembled by Archduke Albrecht that verified his suitability to attend the military academy at Wiener Neustadt. Eugen became then the sole archduke to attend the several year long course at the academy (1883–1885) and subsequently successfully graduated as a fully trained general staff officer.

==Military career==
In 1885, Eugen was assigned to the Austro-Hungarian General Staff and rapidly rose through the ranks. He commanded a battalion of Infantry Regiment 13 as a lieutenant colonel before assuming command of the entire regiment as a colonel. Following a further regimental assignment as commanding officer of Hussar regiment 13, he assumed command of an infantry brigade in Olmütz and then a division in Vienna. In 1900 he was appointed to the command of XIV Army Corps in Innsbruck and promoted to General der Kavallerie on 27 April 1901. This command simultaneously also made him the commanding general in Innsbruck and the defence commander for the Tyrol. He was appointed eight years later as an army inspector and senior defence commander for the Tyrol. When in 1909 the possibility of a war against Serbia was in the air he alongside Archduke Franz Ferdinand and General Albori was named as a presumptive army commander.

Eugen also had exercised his influence in the field of personnel. He had urgently recommended Feldmarschallleutnant Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf, his divisional commander at Innsbruck as the successor to the retiring chief of the general staff — General Friedrich von Beck-Rzikowsky. In 1911, the Archduke retired from active military service ostensibly for health reasons. Hötzendorf however suggested in his memoirs that Archduke Franz Ferdinand had become increasingly jealous of the importance of Eugen.
In addition to his military career above all else, Eugen was called upon to perform his duty as the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order. On 11 January 1887, Eugen entered the Teutonic Order as a professed knight. At the same time he was chosen to be the coadjutor of his uncle, Archduke Wilhelm, then &quot;Hoch- und Deutschmeister&quot;.

When Archduke Wilhelm suddenly died, Eugen was enthroned as the new Hoch- und Deutschmeister on 19 November 1894 and in this office he also proved himself very effective. He further developed the institution of the volunteer nursing care (Marianer), founded new hospitals and improved the training of the sisters. Finally he had the central archives of the order in Vienna sorted out and extended.

==World War I==
At the outbreak of the First World War Eugen immediately reported for active duty. At first he was palmed off with a relatively unimportant post as the patron of the voluntary war welfare organization. Finally he was transferred in December 1914 to replace Oskar Potiorek and assume the post of commander of the forces in the Balkans (&quot;Balkanstreitkräfte&quot;) with his headquarters at Peterwardein. Together with his chief of Staff, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Alfred Krauss, a very talented military theoretician with a decisive and vigorous character, he reorganized the hard hit 5th Army.

On 22 May 1915, Eugen was promoted to Generaloberst. Two days later on 24 May he was entrusted with the command of the southwestern front against Italy. He moved his headquarters to Marburg (Maribor) and now commanded a theatre stretching from the Swiss border to the Adriatic. His main objective here was straightforward defence against the many times numerically superior Italian forces. Only at the beginning was the designation &quot;Southwest Front Command&quot; clear. From March 1916, it functioned as &quot;Heeresgruppen-Kommando Erzherzog Eugen&quot; in Tyrol to the exclusion of the remaining parts of the front and at the beginning of the execution of the 12th battle of the Isonzo as &quot;Heeresfront Erzherzog Eugen&quot; with the allied German 14th Army and &quot;Heeresgruppe von Boroević&quot; under command but Heeresgruppe von Conrad was not immediately subordinate.

During the First Battle of the Isonzo Eugen traveled back and forth behind the front. He attended many conferences, appeared on the front lines and encouraged the troops and in this way achieved great popularity. At the same time he managed the rear areas in order to guarantee the best possible supply to the forward troops.

Before the great attack from the South Tyrol which took take place in the spring of 1916 Eugen assumed command as army group commander of the 11th and 3rd armies and took up headquarters at the estate of his cousin, the Graf von Bozen und Maurer, just outside Bozen (Bolzano). After initial success, the attack had to be broken off in consequence of the danger posed to the Russian front following the Brusilov offensive of June 1916 and the subsequent transfer of formations to that threatened front. However, after breaking off the offensive, Archduke Eugen successfully withdrew his troops in the second half of June 1916 into secure positions.

In the further course of the war Eugen had to transfer more and more of his troops to the hard fighting Isonzo Army so that he soon had to manage without reserves in his own theatre of operations. Although he had only a very limited forces holding the Tyrolean front, he never considered withdrawing further and shortening his line. He was too personally attached to the land to do that.

Eugen was promoted to Field Marshal on 23 November 1916 and in the middle of March 1917 again took up his work as the commander of the southwest front. During the Caporetto offensive, Eugen was the actual commander employing his complete energy in the process. He recognized that this was the last favorable opportunity for the Central Powers. The Archduke, who normally was no great flayer of the soldiers could on this occasion not push hard enough. There appeared temporarily to be great confusion in the issuing of orders. It is possible that many blamed Eugen and his staff for this.

Against the will of the chief of the general staff, Generaloberst Baron Arz von Straußenburg, the Emperor Karl released Eugen from active service on 18 December 1917. The southwestern front command was terminated. The relief of Eugen does not appear to have been made for personal but on objective reasons. After Russia&#x27;s withdrawal from the war and the shortening of various other fronts (Isonzo, Carinthia, Dolomites), the senior generals pushed at the Piave. With his very senior rank, Eugen could only be a commander in chief. Eugen was forced to go as the Emperor Karl himself took up the supreme command.

Eugen still enjoyed high renown and at the end of the war at the beginning of November 1918, the idea of Eugen becoming a regent was introduced. The last foreign minister Graf Andrassy and the member of parliament Dr. Franz Dinghofer of the German nationalist party had discussed this. However, Eugen would never have accepted such an offer without the consent of the emperor.

==Later life==

Following the collapse of the monarchy Eugen first settled in Lucerne and then at Basel where he lived modestly in a hotel from 1918 to 1934. In order to safeguard the existence of the Teutonic Order, Eugen voluntarily resigned his position as the &quot;Hoch- und Deutschmeister&quot; in 1923. He had been the last hereditary grand master of the order. In this way the possessions of the order were saved.

In 1934, Eugen settled at the order&#x27;s convent at Gumpoldskirchen near Vienna. He participated at monarchical rallies, attended veterans&#x27; meetings and placed himself again at the service of the dynasty even though he himself no longer believed that he would live to see the restoration. Following the Anschluß of Austria to Germany in 1938 the Teutonic Order was dissolved and its possessions confiscated.

Eugen received, probably with the intervention of Hermann Göring and other senior military figures, a rented house at Hietzing where he survived the Second World War. In 1945, he fled to the Tyrol where he received through the French occupying power a small rented villa at Igls. On 21 May 1953, the whole of Innsbruck celebrated the field marshal&#x27;s 90th birthday.

Eugen died on 30 December 1954 at Meran, by then part of Italy, the oldest living member of the dynasty at the time and later the 2nd oldest ever Archduke of Austria, surrounded by the brothers of his order from Lana. On 6 January 1955, he was buried in the St. Jakobskirche at Innsbruck next to Archduke Maximilian III (1558–1618).

<text>MkLinux (for Microkernel Linux) is an open-source software computer operating system begun by the Open Software Foundation Research Institute and Apple Computer in February 1996, to port Linux to the PowerPC platform, and Macintosh computers. The name refers to the Linux kernel being adapted to run as a server hosted on the Mach microkernel, version 3.0.

==History==

MkLinux started as a project sponsored by Apple Computer and OSF Research Institute, to get &quot;Linux on Mach&quot; ported to the Macintosh computer and for Apple to explore alternative kernel technologies on the Mac platform. At the time, there was no officially sponsored PowerPC port of Linux, and none specifically for Macintosh hardware. The OSF Institute, owner of the Mach microkernel and several other Unix-based technologies, was interested in promoting Mach on other platforms. Unlike the design of the later macOS versions 10 and newer (not to be confused with the contemporaneous Mac OS versions 9 and older), MkLinux was designed to take full advantage of the Mach microkernel.

The effort was spearheaded by Apple&#x27;s VP of Development Tools Ike Nassi and Brett Halle at Apple, and development was later split between two main people: Michael Burg on device drivers and distribution at Apple in Cupertino, California; and Nick Stephen on Mach porting and development at the OSF in Grenoble, France. Other key individuals to work on the project included François Barbou at OSF, and Vicki Brown and Gilbert Coville at Apple.

MkLinux was officially announced at the 1996 World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC). A free CD containing a binary distribution of MkLinux was handed out to the attendees.

In mid 1998, the community-led MkLinux Developers Association took over development of the operating system.

The MkLinux distribution was too large for casual users to have downloaded via the slow dial-up Internet access of the day, even when using 56k modems. However, the official CDs were available in a book from Prime Time Freeware, published in English and in Japanese. The book covers installation, management, and use of the OS, and serves as a hardcopy manual.

Apple later released the Open Firmware-based Power Macintosh computers, an official PowerPC branch of the Linux kernel was created and was spearheaded by the LinuxPPC project. MkLinux and LinuxPPC developers traded a lot of ideas back and forth as both worked on their own ways of running Linux. Debian also released a traditional monolithic kernel distribution for PowerPC—as did SUSE, and Terra Soft Solutions with Yellow Dog Linux.

When Apple dropped support for MkLinux, the developer community struggled to improve the Mach kernel, and to support various Power Macintosh models. MkLinux continued to be the only option for Macintosh NuBus computers until June 2000, when PPC/Linux for NuBus Power Macs was released.

==Reception==
&quot;MacTech&quot; magazine observed this of the general state of Linux on Macintosh in 1999: &quot;Seen as a Windows NT or commercial Unix killer in some circles, Linux also promises to give the Mac OS a boost in the right direction and might even give Mac OS X Server a run for its money among Apple shops.&quot; The installation process was seen as &quot;either smooth as silk or very, very rough&quot; and that it &quot;can also be slightly more difficult to recompile the MkLinux kernel because of the extra steps to placate the Mach microkernel.&quot; MkLinux had greater hardware compatibility than LinuxPPC at the time, supporting both NuBus and PCI Macintosh systems whereas LinuxPPC only supports PCI. Compared to LinuxPPC, MkLinux was generally known as having a performance cost due to the overhead of the Mach kernel. The Linux environment was found to provide a potentially adequate desktop suite, but one that forgoes the entire Macintosh experience in favor of pure Linux.

===Legacy===
MkLinux is the first official attempt by Apple to support a free and open-source software project. The work done with the Mach 3.0 kernel in MkLinux is said to have been extremely helpful in the initial porting of NeXTSTEP to the Macintosh hardware platform, which would later become macOS.

<text>In the geometry of triangles, the incircle and nine-point circle of a triangle are internally tangent to each other at the Feuerbach point of the triangle. The Feuerbach point is a triangle center, meaning that its definition does not depend on the placement and scale of the triangle. It is listed as X(11) in Clark Kimberling&#x27;s Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers, and is named after Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach.

Feuerbach&#x27;s theorem, published by Feuerbach in 1822, states more generally that the nine-point circle is tangent to the three excircles of the triangle as well as its incircle. A very short proof of this theorem based on Casey&#x27;s theorem on the bitangents of four circles tangent to a fifth circle was published by John Casey in 1866; Feuerbach&#x27;s theorem has also been used as a test case for automated theorem proving. The three points of tangency with the excircles form the Feuerbach triangle of the given triangle.

==Construction==
The incircle of a triangle &quot;ABC&quot; is a circle that is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. Its center, the incenter of the triangle, lies at the point where the three internal angle bisectors of the triangle cross each other.

The nine-point circle is another circle defined from a triangle. It is so called because it passes through nine significant points of the triangle, among which the simplest to construct are the midpoints of the triangle&#x27;s sides. The nine-point circle passes through these three midpoints; thus, it is the circumcircle of the medial triangle.

These two circles meet in a single point, where they are tangent to each other. That point of tangency is the Feuerbach point of the triangle.

Associated with the incircle of a triangle are three more circles, the excircles. These are circles that are each tangent to the three lines through the triangle&#x27;s sides. Each excircle touches one of these lines from the opposite side of the triangle, and is on the same side as the triangle for the other two lines. Like the incircle, the excircles are all tangent to the nine-point circle. Their points of tangency with the nine-point circle form a triangle, the Feuerbach triangle.

==Properties==
The Feuerbach point lies on the line through the centers of the two tangent circles that define it. These centers are the incenter and nine-point center of the triangle.

Let formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 be the three distances of the Feuerbach point to the vertices of the medial triangle (the midpoints of the sides &quot;BC=a, CA=b&quot;, and &quot;AB=c&quot; respectively of the original triangle). Then,
:formula_4
or, equivalently, the largest of the three distances equals the sum of the other two. Specifically, we have formula_5 where &quot;O&quot; is the reference triangle&#x27;s circumcenter and &quot;I&quot; is its incenter.

The latter property also holds for the tangency point of any of the excircles with the nine–point circle: the greatest distance from this tangency to one of the original triangle&#x27;s side midpoints equals the sum of the distances to the other two side midpoints.

If the incircle of triangle ABC touches the sides &quot;BC, CA, AB&quot; at &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; respectively, and the midpoints of these sides are respectively &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, and &quot;R&quot;, then with Feuerbach point &quot;F&quot; the triangles &quot;FPX&quot;, &quot;FQY&quot;, and &quot;FRZ&quot; are similar to the triangles &quot;AOI, BOI, COI&quot; respectively.

==Coordinates==
The trilinear coordinates for the Feuerbach point are
: formula_6
Its barycentric coordinates are
:formula_7

where &quot;s&quot; is the triangle&#x27;s semiperimeter, formula_8.

The three lines from the vertices of the original triangle through the corresponding vertices of the Feuerbach triangle meet at another triangle center, listed as X(12) in the Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. Its trilinear coordinates are:
:formula_9

<text>Tanichthys micagemmae is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish. It is a member of the carp family (family Cyprinidae) of order Cypriniformes. It was only discovered in 2001, in a tributary of the Bến Hải River in Quảng Bình Province, Vietnam. Its range includes what was the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam and was subject to intense bombing during the Vietnam War.

It is similar in appearance to the White Cloud Mountain minnow (&quot;T. albonubes&quot;), the most familiar member of its genus, which is a commonly sold freshwater aquarium fish. &quot;T. micagemmae&quot; can be distinguished from its more familiar relative primarily by the lighter coloration of its lower body and by the centered position of its lateral stripes, compared with a position well above the middle in &quot;T. albonubes.&quot; Some older males develop spectacular elongated dorsal and anal fins.

The species is sold in England under the common name Vietnamese cardinal minnow.

==In the aquarium==

Vietnamese cardinal minnows do best in a water temperature ranging from 19–23 degrees Celsius. Softer water within the range of 37–142 ppm is also preferable. They are peaceful, though males constantly challenge one another, harmlessly, and do well with a variety of fish, such as cyprinids, catfish, loaches, and tetras. &quot;T. micagemmae&quot; is a schooling fish and should be housed with 8-10 other specimens. Like &quot;T. albonubes&quot; the species spawns in pairs along plants; in a well-planted aquarium adults do not seek out their eggs, nor do they harm juveniles: consequently a founder population of males and females will maintain itself indefinitely, under suitable aquarium conditions.
