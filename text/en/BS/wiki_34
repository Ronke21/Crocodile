<text>&quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1839 in &quot;Burton&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, then included in the collection &quot;Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque&quot; in 1840. The short story, a work of Gothic fiction, includes themes of madness, family, isolation, and metaphysical identities.

==Plot==
The story begins with the unnamed narrator arriving at the house of his childhood friend, Roderick Usher, having received a letter from him in a distant part of the country, complaining of an illness and asking for his help. As he arrives, the narrator notices a thin crack extending from the roof, down the front of the house and into the adjacent tarn, or lake.

It is revealed that Roderick&#x27;s sister, Madeline, is also ill and falls into cataleptic, deathlike trances. Roderick and Madeline are the only remaining members of the Usher family.

The narrator is impressed with Roderick&#x27;s paintings and attempts to cheer him by reading with him and listening to his improvised musical compositions on the guitar. Roderick sings &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot;, then tells the narrator that he believes the house he lives in to be alive, and that this sentience arises from the arrangement of the masonry and vegetation surrounding it. Further, Roderick believes that his fate is connected to the family mansion.

Roderick later informs the narrator that Madeline has died. Fearing that her body will be exhumed for medical study, Roderick insists that she be entombed for two weeks in the family tomb located in the house before being permanently buried. The narrator helps Roderick put Madeline&#x27;s body in the tomb, whereupon the narrator realizes that Madeline and Roderick are twins. The narrator also notes that Madeline&#x27;s body has rosy cheeks, which sometimes happens after death. Over the next week, both Roderick and the narrator find themselves increasingly agitated.

A storm begins, and Roderick comes to the narrator&#x27;s bedroom (which is situated directly above the house&#x27;s vault) in an almost hysterical state. Throwing the windows open to the storm, Roderick points out that the lake surrounding the house seems to glow in the dark, just as Roderick depicted in his paintings, but there is no lightning or other explainable source of the glow.

The narrator attempts to calm Roderick by reading aloud from a medieval romance entitled &quot;The Mad Trist&quot;, a novel involving a knight named Ethelred who breaks into a hermit&#x27;s dwelling in an attempt to escape an approaching storm, only to find a palace of gold guarded by a dragon. Ethelred also finds a shining brass shield hanging on a wall. Upon the shield is inscribed:

Ethelred swings his mace at the dragon, which dies with a piercing shriek. When he attempts to take the shield from the wall, it falls to the floor with an unnerving clatter.

As the narrator reads of the knight&#x27;s forcible entry into the dwelling, he and Roderick hear cracking and ripping sounds from somewhere in the house. When the dragon&#x27;s death cries are described, a real shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a hollow metallic reverberation can be heard throughout the house. At first, the narrator ignores the noises, but Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical. Roderick eventually declares that he has been hearing these sounds for days, and that they are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed.

The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline, bloodied from her arduous escape from the tomb. In a final fit of rage, she attacks her brother, scaring him to death as she herself expires. The narrator then runs from the house, and, as he does, he notices a flash of moonlight behind him. He turns back in time to see the Moon shining through the suddenly widened crack in the house. As he watches, the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink away into the lake.

== Character descriptions ==
=== Narrator ===
In &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, Poe&#x27;s unnamed narrator is called to visit the House of Usher by Roderick Usher. As his &quot;best and only friend,&quot; Roderick writes of his illness and asks that the narrator visit him. The narrator is persuaded by Roderick&#x27;s desperation for companionship. Though sympathetic and helpful, the narrator is continually made to be an outsider, watching the narrative unfold without fully becoming a part of it. The narrator also exists as Roderick&#x27;s audience as the men have not remained close. Roderick is convinced of his impending demise and the narrator is gradually drawn into this belief after being brought forth to witness the horrors and hauntings of the House of Usher.

From his arrival, the narrator notes the family&#x27;s isolationist tendencies, as well as the cryptic and special connection between Madeline and Roderick, the final living members of the Usher family. Throughout the tale and her varying states of consciousness, Madeline completely ignores the narrator&#x27;s presence. After Roderick Usher claims that Madeline has died, the narrator helps Usher entomb Madeline in an underground vault despite noticing Madeline&#x27;s flushed, lifelike appearance.

During one sleepless night, the narrator reads aloud to Usher as eerie sounds are heard throughout the mansion. He witnesses Madeline&#x27;s reemergence and the subsequent, simultaneous death of the twins. The narrator is the only character to escape the House of Usher, which he views as it cracks and sinks into the mountain lake.

===Roderick Usher===
Roderick Usher is the twin of Madeline Usher and one of the last living members of the Usher family. Roderick writes to the narrator, his boyhood friend, about an ongoing illness. When the narrator arrives, he is startled to see Roderick&#x27;s eerie and off-putting appearance. He is described by the narrator as having:gray-white skin; eyes large and full of light; lips not bright in color, but of a beautiful shape; a well-shaped nose; hair of great softness — a face that was not easy to forget. And now the increase in this strangeness of his face had caused so great a change that I almost did not know him. The horrible white of his skin, and the strange light in his eyes, surprised me and even made me afraid. His hair had been allowed to grow, and in its softness, it did not fall around his face but seemed to lie upon the air. I could not, even with an effort, see in my friend the appearance of a simple human being.

Roderick Usher is a recluse. He is unwell both physically and mentally. In addition to his constant fear and trepidation, Madeline&#x27;s catalepsy contributes to his decay as he is tormented by the sorrow of watching his sibling die. The narrator states: He admitted ... that much of the peculiar gloom which thus affected him could be traced ... to the evidently approaching dissolution of ... his sole companion. According to Terry W. Thompson, Roderick meticulously plans for Madeline&#x27;s burial to prevent &quot;resurrection men&quot; from stealing his beloved sister&#x27;s corpse for dissection, study, or experimentation as was common in the 18th and 19th centuries for medical schools and physicians in need of cadavers.

Roderick and Madeline are twins and the two share an incommunicable connection that critics conclude may be either incestuous or metaphysical, as two individuals in an extra-sensory relationship embodying a single entity. To that end, Roderick&#x27;s deteriorating condition speeds his own torment and eventual death.

Like Madeline, Roderick is connected to the mansion, the titular House of Usher. He believes the mansion is sentient and responsible, in part, for his deteriorating mental health and melancholy. Despite this admission, Usher remains in the mansion and composes art containing the Usher mansion or similar haunted mansions. His mental health deteriorates faster as he begins to hear Madeline&#x27;s attempts to escape the underground vault she was buried in, and he eventually meets his death out of fear in a manner similar to the House of Usher&#x27;s cracking and sinking.

===Madeline Usher===
Madeline Usher is the twin sister of Roderick Usher. She is deathly ill and cataleptic. She appears near the narrator, but never acknowledges his presence. She returns to her bedroom where Roderick claims she has died. The narrator and Roderick place her in a tomb despite her flushed, lively appearance. In the tale&#x27;s conclusion, Madeline escapes from the tomb and returns to Roderick, scaring him to death.

According to Poe&#x27;s detective methodology in literature, Madeline Usher may be the physical embodiment of the supernatural and metaphysical worlds. Her limited presence is explained as a personification of Roderick&#x27;s torment and fear. Madeline does not appear until she is summoned through her brother&#x27;s fear, foreshadowed in the epigraph, with a quote from French poet Pierre-Jean de Béranger: &quot;Son cœur est un luth suspendu; / Sitôt qu&#x27;on le touche il résonne&quot;, meaning &quot;His heart is a suspended lute; as soon as one touches it, it resonates&quot;.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; was first published in September 1839 in &quot;Burton&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. It was revised slightly in 1840 for the collection &quot;Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque&quot;. It contains Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot;, which earlier was published separately in the April 1839 issue of &quot;Baltimore Museum&quot;.

In 1928, Éditions Narcisse, predecessor to the Black Sun Press, published a limited edition of 300 numbered copies with illustrations by Alastair.

== Sources of inspiration ==

Poe&#x27;s inspiration for the story may be based upon events of the Hezekiah Usher House, which was located on the Usher estate that is now a three-block area in downtown modern Boston, Massachusetts. Adjacent to Boston Common and bounded by Tremont Street to the northwest, Washington Street to the southeast, Avery Street to the south and Winter Street to the north, the house was constructed in 1684 and either torn down or relocated in 1830. Other sources indicate that a sailor and the young wife of the older owner were caught and entombed in their trysting spot by her husband. When the Usher House was torn down in 1830, two bodies were found embraced in a cavity in the cellar.

Another source of inspiration may be from an actual couple, Mr. and Mrs. Luke Usher, the friends and acting colleagues of his mother Eliza Poe. The couple took care of Eliza&#x27;s three children (including Poe) during her time of illness and eventual death.

German writer E.T.A. Hoffmann, who was a role model and inspiration for Poe, published the story &quot; in 1819. There are many similarities between the two stories, including the physical breaking of a house, eerie sounds in the night, the story within a story and the house owner being called Roderich or Roderick. Because Poe was familiar with Hoffmann&#x27;s works, he knew the story and drew from it using the elements for his own purposes.

Another German author, Heinrich Clauren&#x27;s, 1812 story &quot;, as translated into English by Joseph Hardman and published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1828 as &quot;The Robber&#x27;s Tower&quot;, may have served as an inspiration, according to Arno Schmidt and Thomas Hansen. As well as its sharing common elements, such as a young woman with a fear of premature burial interred in a sepulcher directly beneath the protagonist&#x27;s chamber, stringed instruments, and the living twin of the buried girl, Diane Hoeveler identifies textual evidence of Poe&#x27;s use of the story, and concludes that the inclusion of &quot;Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae&quot; (Vigils for the Dead according to the Use of the Church of Mainz) is drawn from the use of a similarly obscure book in &quot;The Robber&#x27;s Tower&quot;.

The theme of the crumbling, haunted castle is a key feature of Horace Walpole&#x27;s &quot;Castle of Otranto&quot; (1764), which largely contributed in defining the Gothic genre.

==Analysis==

&quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; is considered the best example of Poe&#x27;s &quot;totality&quot;, wherein every element and detail is related and relevant.

The presence of a capacious, disintegrating house symbolizing the destruction of the human body continues to be a characteristic element in Poe&#x27;s later work.

&quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; shows Poe&#x27;s ability to create an emotional tone in his work, specifically emphasizing feelings of fear, impending doom, and guilt. These emotions center on Roderick Usher, who, like many Poe characters, suffers from an unnamed disease. Like the narrator in &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, this disease inflames Roderick&#x27;s hyperactive senses. The illness manifests physically but is based in Roderick&#x27;s mental or even moral state. He is sick, it is suggested, because he expects to be sick based on his family&#x27;s history of illness and is, therefore, essentially a hypochondriac. Similarly, he buries his sister alive because he expects to bury her alive, creating his own self-fulfilling prophecy.

The House of Usher, itself doubly referring both to the actual structure and the family, plays a significant role in the story. It is the first &quot;character&quot; that the narrator introduces to the reader, presented with a humanized description: Its windows are described as &quot;eye-like&quot; twice in the first paragraph. The fissure that develops in its side is symbolic of the decay of the Usher family and the house &quot;dies&quot; along with the two Usher siblings. This connection was emphasized in Roderick&#x27;s poem &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot;, which seems to be a direct reference to the house that foreshadows doom.

L. Sprague de Camp in his &quot;Lovecraft: A Biography&quot; wrote that &quot;[a]ccording to the late [Poe expert] Thomas O. Mabbott, H.P. Lovecraft, in &#x27;Supernatural Horror&#x27;, solved a problem in the interpretation of Poe&quot; by arguing that &quot;Roderick Usher, his sister Madeline, and the house all shared one common soul&quot;.

The plot of this tale has prompted many critics to analyze it as a description of the human psyche, comparing, for instance, the House to the unconscious, and its central crack to a split personality. An incestuous relationship between Roderick and Madeline never is explicitly stated, but may be implied by the attachment between the two siblings.

Opium, which Poe mentions several times in both his prose and poems, is mentioned twice in the tale. The gloomy sensation occasioned by the dreary landscape around the Usher mansion is compared by the narrator to the sickness caused by the withdrawal symptoms of an opiate-addict. The narrator also describes Roderick Usher&#x27;s appearance as that of an &quot;irreclaimable eater of opium.&quot;

While there are no direct statements supporting their conclusions, scholars have demonstrated the language deployed by Roderick to describe his sister as full of hints of the possible incestuous relationship between the twins. They argue that this perversion is the actual cause of the fall of the house as well as an end to the lineage of Ushers.

===Allusions and references===
* The opening epigraph quotes &quot;Le Refus&quot; (1831) by the French songwriter Pierre-Jean de Béranger, translated to English as &quot;his heart is a suspended lute, as soon as it is touched, it resounds&quot;. Béranger&#x27;s original text reads &quot;&quot;Mon cœur&quot; (my heart) and not &quot;Son cœur&quot;&quot; (his/her heart).
* The narrator describes one of Usher&#x27;s musical compositions as a &quot;singular perversion and amplification of the wild air of the last waltz of Von Weber&quot;. Poe here refers to a popular piano work of his time – which, though going by the title &quot;Weber&#x27;s Last Waltz&quot;, was actually composed by Carl Gottlieb Reissiger. A manuscript copy of the music was found among Weber&#x27;s papers upon his death in 1826 and the work was mistakenly attributed to him.
* Usher&#x27;s painting reminds the narrator of the Swiss-born British painter Henry Fuseli.

Usher&#x27;s library is mentioned to have &quot;formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid [Roderick Usher]&quot;. A list of titles is provided in the story, all of which are allusions to real-world works. Several notable examples include:

* The &quot;Belphegor&quot; of Machiavelli, a tale involving demonic possession.
* Emanuel Swedenborg&#x27;s &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, a book about divine visions and the afterlife.
* &quot;Directorium Inquisitorum&quot;, a list of heretical forbidden works.
* &quot;Civitas Solis&quot;, a short Utopian work about a theocratic society. The philosopher and poet Tommaso Campanella believed that the world has a spiritual nature.

==Literary significance and criticism==

Along with &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, and &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;, &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; is considered among Poe&#x27;s more famous works of prose. As G.R. Thomson writes in his introduction to &quot;Great Short Works of Edgar Allan Poe&quot;, &quot;the tale has long been hailed as a masterpiece of Gothic horror; it is also a masterpiece of dramatic irony and structural symbolism&quot;.

&quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; has been criticized for being too formulaic, particularly in how Poe followed patterns established in his own works like &quot;Morella&quot; and &quot;Ligeia&quot;, using stock characters in stock scenes and stock situations. Repetitive themes like an unidentifiable disease, madness, and resurrection are also criticized. Washington Irving explained to Poe in a letter dated November 6, 1839: &quot;You have been too anxious to present your pictures vividly to the eye, or too distrustful of your effect, and had laid on too much colouring. It is erring on the best side – the side of luxuriance&quot;.

John McAleer maintained that Herman Melville&#x27;s idea for &quot;objectifying Ahab&#x27;s flawed character&quot; in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; came from the &quot;evocative force&quot; of Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;. In both Ahab and the house of Usher, the appearance of fundamental soundness is visibly flawed – by Ahab&#x27;s livid scar, and by the fissure in the masonry of Usher.

<text>TVT Records, originally Tee-Vee Toons, was an American record label founded by Steve Gottlieb in 1984. Initially created to release the &quot;Television&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; series of classic TV theme tune compilations, the label would expand into rap, industrial rock, and electronic music amassing 25 Gold, Platinum, and Multi-Platinum albums over the course of its 24-year history.

After losing a legal battle with Slip-N-Slide Records, TVT Records filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and the company&#x27;s assets were acquired by The Orchard and Reservoir Media. Content that had previously been transferred to Prudential Financial was acquired by Bicycle Music Company in 2010.

The label&#x27;s roster included Nine Inch Nails, Ja Rule, Lil Jon, Underworld, KMFDM, Gravity Kills, The KLF, The Baldwin Brothers, Sevendust, Nothingface, the Wellwater Conspiracy, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Holloways, The Cinematics, Buck-O-Nine, DJ Hurricane, Speech and Pitbull. The label had a triple platinum release with Nine Inch Nails&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, two double platinum releases by Lil Jon, and platinum releases by Snoop Dogg and Tha Eastsidaz, Dashboard Confessional, Default and Ying Yang Twins, as well as gold releases by Sevendust, Gravity Kills, and The Black Crowes and Jimmy Page. Additionally, TVT achieved a gold release in Germany and Sweden with The Connells, and scored platinum and gold records in Canada with Default.

==History==
===Early years===
TeeVee Toons was founded in August 1984 by Steve Gottlieb, a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law. Gottlieb launched the label from his New York City apartment with the release of &quot;Television&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, an album featuring theme songs from classic TV shows that became a respectable seller. The San Francisco Chronicle called the album &quot;the most fun you can have with your pants on&quot;, and the &quot;New York Times&quot; highlighted it as one of 1985&#x27;s most notable business ideas.

In 1986, TeeVee Toons was shortened to TVT Records. In 1988–89, TVT signed industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, and they released their debut studio album &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; on October 20, 1989. But there was tension between Gottlieb and NIN frontman Trent Reznor throughout the promotion. According to Reznor, Gottlieb called Nine Inch Nails&#x27; record an &quot;abortion&quot;. Gottlieb reportedly said to Reznor: &quot;You fucked up what could have been a good career.&quot; 

When &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot; sold 1,000,000 copies, Gottlieb allegedly reacted rudely, ordering the band to sell four million copies of the follow-up. While NIN was on tour, TVT released an EP for the single &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot; that was longer in length than the original album. There were disputes between Reznor and TVT regarding financial compensation, and he said TVT pressured him to make a follow-up record that sounded identical to &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;. Worried that TVT would interfere with his creative control, Reznor secretly started recording what would become &quot;Broken&quot; in 1992. He met Jimmy Iovine, founder of Interscope Records. In 1992, Reznor and TVT reached an agreement where NIN would leave TVT and move to Interscope, but TVT would receive royalties from future NIN releases.

In 1996 Crain&#x27;s named Gottlieb one of its Forty Under 40 Rising Stars to Watch, citing the 50% yearly growth of TVT. In 1999 TVT completed a securitization that enabled it to raise $23.5 million in growth capital.

===Later years===
In 2000, TVT became the first label to put its entire catalog online available for downloading and free streaming by fans. In 2001, the label reached an amicable arrangement with Napster for use of TVT&#x27;s artist copyrights, and TVT&#x27;s CEO joined the Napster advisory board. Gottlieb appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2001 on a panel that included Richard Parsons, then head of Time Warner; Ken Berry, head of EMI; and artists Alanis Morissette and Don Henley. CEO Gottlieb served on the Board of Directors of Musicmatch (sold to Yahoo!).

TVT was one of the founding members of the Association of Independent Music (A2IM), an organization devoted to protecting independent labels&#x27; interests.

In 2002, the label got into a dispute with Lyor Cohen, then head of Island Def Jam. The dispute involved Cohen and Universal paying former TVT artist Ja Rule $8 million to not deliver an album paid for by TVT, and promised to TVT and instead deliver it to Universal. In the resulting litigation Universal was prohibited by the courts from releasing the album created with TVT&#x27;s funding. In the ultimate trial over the claims of fraud and tortious interference, a jury awarded TVT a $132 million judgment. Universal appealed the ruling. On appeal, Cohen and Universal argued the existence of an agreement between the parties meant that their behavior was only a breach of contract and not a fraud or tort. The court agreed, reducing TVT&#x27;s award to $126,000.

In 2002, Prudential Financial acquired the rights to &quot;Pretty Hate Machine&quot;, The Connells, the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; soundtracks, the first seven volumes of &quot;Television&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, and a Wax Trax boxed set; certain publishing rights in compositions from KMFDM, Gil Scott-Heron and Nine Inch Nails, among others; and trademarks, including the &quot;Television&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot; logo, after TVT had defaulted on a loan to Prudential. In 2005, Prudential placed the catalogue up for sale.

====Slip-N-Slide lawsuit/Bankruptcy====
In 2007, TVT lost a $9 million lawsuit to Slip-N-Slide Records when a Florida judge ruled that Slip-N-Slide had legal rights to distribute an unreleased album it owned by rapper Pitbull that he recorded for Slip-N-Slide in 2001. TVT, who signed Pitbull several years later, had sought to notice third parties (such as record stores or digital download entities) that the distribution and sale of this album would violate TVT&#x27;s exclusive right to create new music by the artist. The judge, however, ruled against TVT as Pitbull had made the recordings prior to signing with TVT, and awarded Slip-N-Slide the $9 million judgement as TVT had attempted to block the sale of the album. TVT filed for appeal but was unable to post the required bond, thus TVT filed for bankruptcy.

On February 19, 2008, Gottlieb stated &quot;This is not the end of TVT.&quot; In June 2008, however, the digital music label The Orchard was declared the winning bidder by a New York bankruptcy court, paying $6.05 million. The Orchard gained control of TVT&#x27;s artist contracts, catalogue recordings, and its distribution infrastructure, thus ending the TVT Records label imprint. The music publishing assets were transferred to TVT Music Enterprises, and later purchased by Reservoir Media. On April 6, 2010, The Bicycle Music Company acquired 700 master recordings across 80 albums, including the catalogues of Nine Inch Nails, The Connells and &quot;Television&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, from Prudential.

<text>Michael Joseph Connelly (born July 21, 1956) is an American author of detective novels and other crime fiction, notably those featuring LAPD Detective Hieronymus &quot;Harry&quot; Bosch and criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller. 
Connelly is the bestselling author of 38 novels and one work of non-fiction, with over 74 million copies of his books sold worldwide and translated into 40 languages. His first novel, &quot;The Black Echo&quot;, won the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award for Best First Novel in 1992. In 2002, Clint Eastwood directed and starred in the movie adaptation of Connelly&#x27;s 1997 novel, &quot;Blood Work&quot;. In March 2011, the movie adaptation of Connelly&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot; starred Matthew McConaughey as Mickey Haller. Connelly was the President of the Mystery Writers of America from 2003 to 2004.

==Early life==
Connelly was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second eldest child of W. Michael Connelly, a property developer, and Mary Connelly, a homemaker. He is of Irish ancestry. According to Connelly, his father was a frustrated artist who encouraged his children to want to succeed in life and was a risk taker who alternated between success and failure in his pursuit of a career. Connelly&#x27;s mother was a fan of crime fiction and introduced her son to the world of mystery novels.

At age 12, Connelly moved with his family from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he attended St. Thomas Aquinas High School. At age 16, Connelly&#x27;s interest in crime and mystery escalated when, on his way home from his work as a hotel dishwasher, he witnessed a man throw an object into a hedge. Connelly decided to investigate and found that the object was a gun wrapped in a lumberjack shirt. After putting the gun back, he followed the man to a bar and then left to go home to tell his father. Later that night, Connelly brought the police down to the bar, but the man was already gone. This event introduced Connelly to the world of police officers and their lives, impressing him with the way they worked.

Connelly had planned on following his father&#x27;s early choice of career in building construction and started out at the University of Florida in Gainesville, at the Rinker School of Building Construction, studying construction management. After earning grades that were lower than expected, Connelly went to see Robert Altman&#x27;s film &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973). The film, based on Raymond Chandler&#x27;s eponymous 1953 novel, inspired Connelly to want to become a mystery writer. Connelly went home and read all of Chandler&#x27;s works featuring Philip Marlowe, and decided to transfer to the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications, major in journalism, and minor in creative writing.

==Early career==
After graduating from the University of Florida in 1980, Connelly got a job as a crime beat writer at the &quot;Daytona Beach News-Journal&quot;, where he worked for almost two years until he went to the &quot;Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel&quot; in 1981. There, he covered the crime beat during the South Florida cocaine wars. He stayed with the paper for a few years and in 1986, he and two other reporters spent several months interviewing survivors of the 1985 Delta Flight 191 plane crash, which story earned Connelly a place as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. The honor also brought Connelly a job as a crime reporter at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. He moved to California in 1987 with his wife Linda McCaleb, whom he met while in college and married in April 1984.

After moving to Los Angeles, Connelly went to see High Tower Court where Raymond Chandler&#x27;s character Philip Marlowe had lived (in his 1942 novel &quot;The High Window&quot;), and Robert Altman had used for his film &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973). Connelly got the manager of the building to promise to phone him if the apartment ever became available. Ten years later, the manager tracked Connelly down, and Connelly decided to rent the place. This apartment served as a place to write for several years.

After three years at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Connelly wrote his first published novel, &quot;The Black Echo&quot; (1992), after previously writing two unfinished novels that he did not attempt to get published. He sold &quot;The Black Echo&quot; to Little, Brown to be published in 1992 and won the Mystery Writers of America&#x27;s Edgar Award for Best first Novel. The book is partly based on a true crime and is the first one featuring Connelly&#x27;s primary recurring character, Los Angeles Police Department Detective Hieronymus &quot;Harry&quot; Bosch, a man who, according to Connelly, shares few similarities with the author himself. Connelly named Bosch after the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, known for his paintings full of sin and redemption, such as the painting &quot;Hell&quot;, a copy of which hangs on the office wall behind Connelly&#x27;s computer. Connelly describes his own work as a big canvas with all the characters of his books floating across it as currents on a painting. Sometimes they are bound to collide, creating cross currents. This is something that Connelly creates by bringing back characters from previous books and letting them play a part in books written five or six years after first being introduced.

Connelly went on to write three more novels about Detective Bosch—&quot;The Black Ice&quot; (1993), &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; (1994), and &quot;The Last Coyote&quot; (1995)—before quitting his job as a reporter to write full-time.

==Full-time novelist==
Michael Connelly received a good deal of publicity in 1994, when President Bill Clinton came out of a bookstore carrying a copy of &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; in front of the waiting cameras. A meeting was set up between the two at Los Angeles International Airport.

In 1996, Connelly wrote &quot;The Poet&quot;, his first book not to feature Bosch, instead the protagonist was reporter Jack McEvoy. The book was a success. In 1997, Connelly returned to Bosch in &quot;Trunk Music&quot; before writing another book, &quot;Blood Work&quot; (1997), about a different character, FBI agent Terry McCaleb. &quot;Blood Work&quot; was made into a film in 2002, directed by Clint Eastwood, who also played McCaleb, an agent with a transplanted heart, in pursuit of his donor&#x27;s murderer. The book came together after one of Connelly&#x27;s friends had a heart transplant and he saw what his friend was going through with survivor&#x27;s guilt after the surgery. When asked if he had anything against the changes made to fit the big screen, Connelly simply replied: &quot;If you take their money, it&#x27;s their turn to tell the story&quot;.

Connelly wrote another book featuring Bosch, &quot;Angels Flight&quot; (1999), before writing &quot;Void Moon&quot; (2000), a free-standing book about Las Vegas thief Cassie Black. In 2001, &quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot; was published, in which Connelly united Bosch and McCaleb to solve a crime together, before releasing two books in 2002. The first, &quot;City of Bones&quot;, was the eighth Bosch novel, and the other, &quot;Chasing the Dime&quot;, was a non-series novel. In 2001, Connelly left California for Tampa Bay, Florida, together with his wife and daughter, so that both he and his wife could be closer to their families. His novels still took place in Los Angeles.

In 2003, another Bosch novel, &quot;Lost Light&quot;, was published. With this book, a CD was released, &quot;Dark Sacred Night, the Music of Harry Bosch&quot;, featuring some of the jazz music that both Connelly and the fictional character Bosch listen to. While writing Connelly listens exclusively to instrumental jazz, though, because it does not have intrusive vocals, and because the improvisational playing inspires his writing. &quot;The Narrows&quot;, published in 2004, was a sequel to &quot;The Poet&quot; but featured Bosch instead of McEvoy. Together with this book, a DVD was released called &quot;Blue Neon Night: Michael Connelly&#x27;s Los Angeles&quot;, in which film Connelly presents some of the places in Los Angeles that are frequently featured in his books.

&quot;The Closers&quot;, published in May 2005, was the 11th Bosch novel. It was followed by &quot;The Lincoln Lawyer&quot; in October, Connelly&#x27;s first legal novel; it features defense attorney Mickey Haller, Bosch&#x27;s half-brother. The book was made into a film in 2011, starring Matthew McConaughey as Haller. After releasing &quot;Crime Beat&quot; (2004), a non-fiction book about Connelly&#x27;s experiences as a crime reporter, Connelly went back to Bosch with &quot;Echo Park&quot; (2006). This book sets its opening scene in the High Tower Apartment that Connelly rented and wrote from. His next Bosch story, &quot;The Overlook&quot;, was originally published as a multi-part series in the &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot;. After some editing, it was published as a novel in 2007. In October 2008, Connelly wrote &quot;The Brass Verdict&quot;, which brought together Bosch and Haller for the first time. He followed that with &quot;The Scarecrow&quot; (May 2009), which brought back McEvoy as the lead character. &quot;9 Dragons&quot;, a novel taking Bosch to Hong Kong, was published in October 2009. &quot;The Reversal&quot; (October 2010), reunites Bosch &amp; Haller as they work together under the banner of the state on the retrial of a child murderer. The Haller novel &quot;The Fifth Witness&quot; was published in 2011.

&quot;The Drop&quot;, which refers in part to the &quot;Deferred Retirement Option Plan&quot; that was described in the novel &quot;The Brass Verdict&quot; (2008), was published in November 2011. The next Bosch novel was &quot;The Black Box&quot; (2012). Connelly&#x27;s subsequent novel, a legal thriller, was a return to Haller: &quot;The Gods of Guilt&quot; (2013). His next book returned to Bosch in &quot;The Burning Room&quot; (2014), and then Connelly used Haller as a main supporting character in the Bosch novels &quot;The Crossing&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Wrong Side of Goodbye&quot; (2016).

==Awards and honors==

Connelly has won nearly every major award given to mystery writers, including the Edgar Award, Anthony Award, Macavity Award, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Best Mystery/Thriller Award, Shamus Award, Dilys Award, Nero Award, Barry Award, Audie Award, Ridley Award, Maltese Falcon Award (Japan), .38 Caliber Award (France), the Grand Prix de Littérature Policière (France) and Premio Bancarella Award (Italy). In 2012, &quot;The Black Box&quot; won the world&#x27;s most lucrative crime fiction award, the RBA Prize for Crime Writing worth €125,000.
He received the Cartier Diamond Dagger in 2018 from the Crime Writers&#x27; Association.

==Writing techniques==
When starting a book, he says, the story is not always clear, but Connelly has “a hunch” as to where it is going. The books often reference real-world events, such as the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the September 11 attacks. Events that might seem of minor significance are included in some of the books, because of Connelly’s personal interest in them. For example, &quot;City of Bones&quot;, in which Detective Bosch investigates the murder of an 11-year-old boy, was written during Connelly&#x27;s early years as a father of a daughter, and it hit close to home. According to Connelly, he didn&#x27;t mean to write about the biggest fear of his life; it just came out that way. David Geherin states that Connelly &quot;deliberately avoids ornate language, the kind that makes the reader stop and savor the choice of words or elegant phrasing. He doesn&#x27;t want anything to inhibit the forward momentum he is working to create.&quot;

Detective Bosch&#x27;s life usually changes in harmony with Connelly&#x27;s own life. When Connelly moved 3,000 miles across the country, Bosch&#x27;s experiences sent him in a new direction in &quot;City of Bones&quot;, written at that time. According to Connelly, his &quot;real&quot; job is to write about Bosch, and he brought McCaleb and Bosch together in &quot;A Darkness More Than Night&quot; in order to look at Bosch from another perspective and to keep the character interesting.

Connelly often changes perspectives between characters in his novels. In &quot;Void Moon&quot;, Connelly frequently alternates between following protagonist Cassie Black and antagonist Jack Karch. In &quot;Fair Warning&quot;, Connelly outright changes the overarching perspective of the book on occasion, regularly following protagonist Jack McEvoy in a first-person point of view while occasionally branching away from his story to follow the antagonists in third-person.

==Recurring characters==

<text>A Sparse graph code is a code which is represented by a sparse graph.

Any linear code can be represented as a graph, where there are two sets of nodes - a set representing the transmitted bits and another set representing the constraints that the transmitted bits have to satisfy. The state of the art classical error-correcting codes are based on sparse graphs, achieving close to the Shannon limit. The archetypal sparse-graph codes are Gallager&#x27;s low-density parity-check codes.

<doc id="543290" wikidata="Q264455" url="?curid=543290" title="List of New York state parks">
<text>This is a list of state parks in the U.S. state of New York. Also listed are state golf courses, seasonal hunting areas, and &quot;former&quot; state parks.

In New York, state parks are managed by the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation (OPRHP), with the exception of the Adirondack and Catskill Parks which are managed by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). Outside of the Adirondacks and the Catskills, the state parks department is organized into eleven regions:
*Niagara
*Allegany
*Genesee
*Finger Lakes
*Central
*Taconic
*Palisades
*Long Island
*Thousand Islands
*Saratoga/Capital District
*New York City

==Forest preserve==
The largest parks in New York are the Adirondack Park, at ; and the Catskill Park, at . Together they comprise the New York Forest Preserve, properties that must be kept &quot;Forever Wild&quot; according to Article 14 of the New York Constitution. Both parks are managed by DEC; the Adirondack Park is managed by the Adirondack Park Agency, as well.

==State parks==

OPRHP manages lands designated as state parks in New York, with the aims of providing public space for outdoor recreation while conserving natural and cultural resources. The agency offers the &quot;Empire Passport&quot;, which provides unlimited day use vehicle entry to most of New York&#x27;s state parks and recreational facilities. As of 2017, New York has 215 state parks and historic sites encompassing 350,000 acres. The agency&#x27;s portfolio also includes 28 golf courses, 35 swimming pools, 67 beaches, and 18 museums and nature centers.

The following sortable tables list &quot;current&quot; and &quot;former&quot; New York state parks, respectively, all &#x27;owned&#x27; or managed by the OPRHP, as of 2015. Some OPRHP-&#x27;owned&#x27; parks are managed primarily or in part by other agencies, through lease or partnership agreements. The second table lists three former New York state parks that have been transferred to other entities.

<doc id="543293" wikidata="Q192035" url="?curid=543293" title="Iván Zamorano">
<text>Iván Luis Zamorano Zamora (; born 18 January 1967) is a Chilean former professional footballer who played as a striker. He is regarded as one of Chile&#x27;s most recognized footballers and one of the greatest strikers of his generation.

He first appeared as a member of the Chile national team in 1987, appearing on the team every year until 2001. During his tenure, he played in the 1998 World Cup, four Copa América tournaments, and the Olympics in 2000 with the u-23 team, where he won a bronze medal and was the top scorer of the tournament. He played for several clubs, notably Spanish clubs Sevilla and Real Madrid; Italian club Inter Milan as well as Liga MX club América. He won the 1994–95 La Liga title and was the season&#x27;s top scorer with Real Madrid. He also won the UEFA Cup with Inter Milan in 1998, as well as the Liga MX title with America his first season with the club. A powerful and prolific goal-scorer, he was particularly renowned for his strength and ability in the air, with many of his goals coming from headers.

In 2004, Zamorano was selected among the FIFA 100, a list of the best living football players in the world compiled by Pelé.

Zamorano was nicknamed &quot;Bam Bam&quot; and &quot;Iván el Terrible&quot;.

==Club career==
Zamorano started his career in Chile with Cobresal in December 1985. He was loaned out to Chilean Primera Division B club Trasandino (called Cobreandino between 1985 and 1992) for the 1985–86 season. He returned to the club shortly after and won the 1987 Copa Chile with Cobresal. In 1988, he moved to Europe to Swiss team St. Gallen, becoming the league&#x27;s top scorer in the 1989–90 season, and scoring 37 goals in 61 matches across three seasons. In 1990, Zamorano debuted in the Spanish &quot;Primera División&quot; with Sevilla, where he would play 63 matches and score 23 goals in all competitions before being sold to Real Madrid for $6 million.

With Real Madrid, between 1992 and 1996, Zamorano won one league, one Copa del Rey and one Spanish Supercup title. In 1995, under manager Jorge Valdano, Zamorano helped Real Madrid win the Spanish League title, as he scored 28 goals – including a hat–trick against Barcelona – and received the Pichichi Trophy as the season&#x27;s top scorer. That year, he formed a particularly effective attacking partnership with playmaker Michael Laudrup. In the 1992–93 and 1994–95 seasons, he won the &quot;EFE Trophy&quot;, which is awarded to the best Ibero-American player in &quot;La Liga&quot; every year by Spanish news agency EFE. In total, Zamorano appeared 173 times for Real Madrid, scoring 101 goals.
After six seasons in the Spanish league, Zamorano played four seasons in Serie A with Inter Milan, from 1996 to 2000, where he was teammates with Youri Djorkaeff, Diego Simeone, Javier Zanetti and Ronaldo, among others. He was initially the club&#x27;s premier striker, playing with the number nine shirt. However, after Roberto Baggio&#x27;s arrival at the club, Ronaldo was forced to give up number ten, and wear number nine according to the terms of a Nike sponsorship. Therefore Zamorano had to give up his number and chose number 18, adding a &quot;+&quot; to his shirt to create the equation &#x27;1+8&#x27;, making him mathematically still a number 9 striker. In May 1998, Inter won the UEFA Cup after beating Lazio in the final 3–0, with Zamorano scoring the opening goal. He had also scored in the second leg of the previous year&#x27;s final, with the game going to penalties. However, Zamorano missed his penalty as Inter lost the shootout to Schalke 04 4–1.

Zamorano would move to Mexico in 2001 to play for América for two seasons, winning the &quot;Torneo de Verano&quot; in the first season. He concluded his career playing for Colo-Colo in 2003, making a childhood dream come true. He announced his retirement in July of that year after a professional career spanning more than 16 years.

==International career==
Zamorano made his debut at the age of 20 on 19 June 1987, scoring a goal in a 3–1 friendly win against Peru. He scored five goals on 29 April 1997 in a 1998 World Cup qualifier against Venezuela, which ended in a 6–0 victory. He played all four of Chile&#x27;s matches at the 1998 World Cup; he was an instrumental part of the Chilean team despite failing to score, setting up Marcelo Salas&#x27; goal in a 1–1 draw against Austria. In the 2000 Olympic Games, he won the bronze medal, scoring a brace in a 2–0 victory against United States, and was the top scorer with six goals. His last international match, at age 34, was a farewell friendly between Chile and France on 1 September 2001, which Chile won 2–1. Zamorano was capped 69 times, scoring 34 goals.

==Personal life==
Zamorano was born in Santiago, Chile and was the only son of Luis Zamorano and Alicia Zamora. The family moved to Maipu three years later. When he was 13, his father who he inherited a love of football from died of fulminating appendicitis.

He has a long-term close friendship with his former fellow footballer Fabián Estay, which was interrupted from 2001 to 2007 due to the fact that Estay stated that Zamorano didn&#x27;t support him when he was isolated from the América first team by the club leaders. In addition, Zamorano is the godfather of the Estay&#x27;s daughter, Renata Ivana.

In 2005, he married María Alberó, an Argentine model. Since 2016, they have lived in Miami.
==Outside football==
Zamorano was the promotional face of the new Santiago transport system, Transantiago, in 2007 which experienced operational difficulties at launch.

In 2021, Zamorano became brand ambassador for Betsson as part of the Chilean National Team choosing the sports betting site as its official betting partner ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

He has worked as a football commentator for media such as Univision and TUDN.

<text>John Nunziata ( , ; born January 4, 1955) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician. He first served as an Alderman in the Borough of York from 1978 to 1982. He served three terms as a Liberal MP in the House of Commons of Canada from York South-Weston and in 1997 was elected as an Independent MP. As of March, 2013, he was a partner in the lobbying firm The Parliamentary Group.

==Background==
Nunziata was born on January 4, 1955, in Revelstoke, British Columbia. He is the fifth of seven children of Italian immigrant parents. In April 1963, his family moved from British Columbia to Toronto, Ontario where he attended grade school at Regal Road Public School and Rockcliffe Senior Public School. He attended high school at Runnymede Collegiate Institute in Toronto where he was elected President of the Student Council in 1973. He was awarded the W.E.H Cross Trophy for his leadership while at Runnymede. In 2002, he was inducted into the Runnymede Collegiate Hall of Fame.

Nunziata graduated from York University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1977 and went on to earn his Bachelor of Laws degree from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1980. He was called to the Ontario bar in 1982. Upon graduation, he established the law firm of Nunziata, Anand &amp; Levy. Nunziata&#x27;s sister, Frances Nunziata, was the last mayor of the city of York, Ontario before it was merged into the &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto, and is now a Toronto city councillor for Ward 11 York South-Weston.

===Awards===
Nunziata has been the recipient of the Borough of York Civic Merit Award (1974), the George Syme and Harwood Ratepayer&#x27;s &quot;Citizen of the Year Award&quot; (1980) and the Canada 125 Medal (1992).

==Politics==

===Provincial===
Originally, he was a member of the New Democratic Party while in high school from 1969 to 1974. He campaigned as a Liberal for a 1982 provincial by-election in York South, but lost to new NDP leader Bob Rae.

===Federal===
Nunziata was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1984 general election as a Liberal despite a national Progressive Conservative landslide. Nunziata thrived as a member of the opposition Rat Pack, a group of Liberal Members of Parliament (MPs) including Don Boudria, Brian Tobin, and Sheila Copps.

Nunziata&#x27;s ideological position in the Liberal Party was not clearly defined at this stage. He stressed &quot;family values&quot; and was opposed to abortion, but his views on other issues were not always socially conservative. During the national debate on capital punishment in 1986, he was one of the strongest parliamentary opponents of any restoration of the death penalty. He was re-elected without difficulty in the 1988 election.

While in Parliament Nunziata served as Opposition Critic for the Solicitor General from 1984 to 1992. He served as the critic for Employment from January 1992 to November 1992. He was chairman of the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group and headed a Caucus Task Force on Pearson International Airport. Nunziata introduced several Private Members Bills including those to repeal the Faint Hope Clause of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; of Canada and to modify the &quot;Young Offenders Act&quot;.

When John Turner resigned as Liberal leader, Nunziata ran to succeed him in the 1990 Liberal leadership convention. He placed last in a field of five candidates.

In the buildup to the 1993 federal election, Nunziata criticised Liberal leader Jean Chrétien for appointing Art Eggleton over a local candidate in York Centre.

On April 21, 1996, Nunziata was expelled from the Liberal caucus after he voted against the government&#x27;s budget in protest over the government breaking a promise to rescind the Goods and Services Tax.

Despite the difficulties of winning a seat as an independent, Nunziata ran and won re-election in the 1997 general election. He defeated Toronto councillor Judy Sgro by 4,431 votes to retain his riding, and so became the only independent member elected to the new parliament.

In the 2000 election, he was defeated by Liberal Alan Tonks.

===Municipal===
Nunziata started his political career in 1978 when he was elected an alderman in the former borough of York at age 23 and while still attending law school. In 1979, Nunziata was the only alderman to vote against the closing of the Beech Hall Seniors&#x27; Apartments. He learned that the residents had not been informed that they were to be evicted, and leaked the story to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. He was responsible for getting the residents to organise and fight for their rights. Eventually, the residents, with the help of the Co-op Housing Foundation of Canada, managed to convert the rental apartments into Toronto&#x27;s first housing co-op. He ran for Mayor of Toronto in the 2003 municipal election, pledging support for the police, and to bring the homeless off the streets and into institutional care facilities. He finished 4th behind winner David Miller with about 5% of the vote. Since 2003, Nunziata has become a partner with the Parliamentary Group and he has responsibility for Queens Park government relations.

In 2013, Nunziata was one of several candidates for appointment to Ward 3 to replace Doug Holyday, who resigned to become an MPP. Nunziata lost out to Peter Leon.

On September 12, 2014, the last day to register as a candidate, Nunziata registered to run for Toronto city council in Ward 12 (York-South Weston) against incumbent Frank Di Giorgio, community leader Lekan Olawoye and former city staffer Nick Dominelli in the October 27 municipal election. Nunziata said he wanted to win the ward to help build consensus on council &quot;so we can actually make a difference&quot;. However, lost to Di Giorgio by a margin of 238 votes or about 1.44% of the popular vote in the ward.

<text>A marten is a weasel-like mammal in the genus Martes within the subfamily Guloninae, in the family Mustelidae. They have bushy tails and large paws with partially retractile claws. The fur varies from yellowish to dark brown, depending on the species; it is valued by animal trappers for the fur trade. Martens are slender, agile animals, which are adapted to living in the taiga, and inhabit coniferous and northern deciduous forests across the Northern Hemisphere.

==Classification==
Results of DNA research indicate that the genus &quot;Martes&quot; is paraphyletic, with some studies placing &quot;Martes americana&quot; outside the genus and allying it with &quot;Eira&quot; and &quot;Gulo&quot;, to form a new New World clade. The genus first evolved up to seven million years ago during the Miocene epoch.







==Fossils==
Several fossil martens have been described, including:
*†&quot;Martes campestris&quot; (Pliocene)
*†&quot;Martes wenzensis&quot; (Pliocene)
*†&quot;Martes vetus&quot; (Pleistocene)

Another described fossil species, &quot;Martes nobilis&quot; from the Holocene, is now considered synonymous with the American marten.

==Etymology==
The Modern English &quot;marten&quot; comes from the Middle English , in turn borrowed from the Anglo-French and Old French , itself from a Germanic source; cf. Old English , Old Norse , and Old High German and Yiddish .

==Ecology and behaviour==
Martens are solitary animals, meeting only to breed in late spring or early summer. Litters of up to five blind and nearly hairless kits are born in early spring. They are weaned after around two months, and leave the mother to fend for themselves at about three to four months of age. They are omnivorous.

===Spatial niche segregation===
The stone marten and the pine marten segregate spatially where they occur in sympatry. This spatial niche segregation is due to the differences regarding their food preferences, adaptability to cold climates and avoidance of predators.
The spatial niche segregation between stone and pine martens is also influenced by each species&#x27; habitat preferences and resource availability within specific ecosystems. Studies in Belarus show that the pine marten is are more densely distributed in clay-rich, biodiverse woodlands, whereas the stone marten is adapted to habitats with greater resource limitations, such as sandy soils, where it relies more on seasonally available resources such as berries and carrion to meet its dietary needs.
In Ireland and Italy, the pine marten displays seasonal stability in home ranges within well-resourced habitats, suggesting that resource abundance can enhance spatial exclusivity and reduce direct competition between species.

==In human culture==
=== Canada ===
The marten is populous in the northern Ontario community of Big Trout Lake. During the fur trade, commissioned by the Hudson Bay Company in the 18th and 19th centuries, the marten pelt was typically fashioned into mittens. The marten is still traded locally. The locals place a high value on this pelt, typically trading it for consumable goods.

===Croatia===
In the Middle Ages, marten pelts were highly valued goods used as a form of payment in Slavonia, the Croatian Littoral, and Dalmatia. The marturina was a form of tax named after this. The banovac, a coin struck and used between 1235 and 1384, included the image of a marten. This is one of the reasons why the Croatian word for marten, &quot;kuna&quot;, was the name of the former Croatian currency. A marten is depicted on the obverse of the 1-, 2-, and 5-kuna coins, minted since 1993, and on the reverse of the 25-kuna commemorative coins. With adoption of euro as the national currency in 2023, a marten continues to be depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 1 euro coin.

A running marten is shown on the coat of arms of Slavonia and subsequently on the modern design of the coat of arms of Croatia. The official seal of the Croatian Parliament from 1497 until the late 18th century had a similar design.

===Finland===
The Finnish communications company Nokia derives its name, via the river Nokianvirta, from a type of marten locally known as the &quot;nokia&quot;.

=== Greece ===
In the &quot;Illiad,&quot; the fleet-footed spy Dolon wore a marten-pelt cap.

=== Italy ===
The Latin word for helmet, &quot;,&quot; originally meant &quot;marten pelt&quot;, although it is unclear whether early Romans wore these helmets for symbolical reasons or for their fine fur.

<doc id="543307" wikidata="Q1124816" url="?curid=543307" title="Supernatural Horror in Literature">
<text>&quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot; is a 28,000-word essay by American writer H. P. Lovecraft, surveying the development and achievements of horror fiction as the field stood in the 1920s and 30s. The essay was researched and written between November 1925 and May 1927, first published in a small-circulation amateur magazine in August 1927, and then revised and expanded during 1933–1934.

==The essay==
Lovecraft&#x27;s meticulously researched essay covers a broad spectrum, attempting to present a comprehensive historical account of horror literature, with insights into the nature, development and history of the weird tale. Beginning with the genre&#x27;s alchemical and folkloric roots, it continues with tales of diabolism from the Renaissance, the birth of Gothic fiction towards the end of the 18th century and its migration to the &quot;New World&quot; during the 19th, and it ends with an acknowledgement of Lovecraft&#x27;s most noteworthy contemporaries. As a guide to early Gothic fiction, the author relied partly on Edith Birkhead&#x27;s 1921 historical work &quot;The Tale of Terror&quot;, and partly on the expertise of the great many experts and collectors in his circle. The bulk of the essay was written in New York City, where Lovecraft had access not only to the vast resources of the New York Public Library and Brooklyn Public Library, but also to his friends&#x27; private collections, that included some rare and obscure works of horror fiction. 

After discussing the prehistory of the genre, citing the Anglo-Saxon epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, and the Elizabethan plays &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;, among other works, which seem to possess the same &quot;dæmoniac&quot; atmosphere that later came to define weird fiction, Lovecraft extensively discusses Horace Walpole&#x27;s Gothic horror classic, &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot; (1764), which became so popular, it essentially established the literary horror story. Clara Reeve&#x27;s &quot;The Old English Baron&quot; (1777), Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne&quot; (1789) and &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot; (1794), and Charles Brockden Brown&#x27;s &quot;Wieland: or, the Transformation&quot; (1798), all followed Walpole&#x27;s success, contributing each in its own way to the enrichment of the genre. In the section titled &quot;The Apex of Gothic Romance&quot;, Lovecraft discusses Matthew Gregory Lewis&#x27;s very popular novel &quot;The Monk&quot; (1797) and Charles Maturin&#x27;s underrated masterpiece &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot; (1820), which evokes Molière&#x27;s &quot;Dom Juan&quot;, Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, and Byron&#x27;s &quot;Manfred&quot;. In the following section, titled &quot;The Aftermath of the Gothic&quot;, he covers authors whose names are regularly associated with Gothic literature, including William Beckford, Bram Stoker, Mary Shelley, and Emily Brontë. From there, he devotes a section each to the continuation of that literary tradition on the European continent, in the British Isles, and in America. Edgar Allan Poe (whom Lovecraft considers a pioneer of the horror tale and a great aesthete) gets a whole section dedicated to himself. Special mention is made of Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Louis Stevenson, Guy de Maupassant, Ambrose Bierce, and Arthur Conan Doyle, accompanied by Lovecraft&#x27;s own opinions and insights in their work. Lovecraft concludes his essay with an in-depth discussion of his contemporaries, including Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, Lord Dunsany, and M. R. James, who he considers the four &quot;modern masters&quot; of the genre.

==Publication history==
The text was first published in August 1927 in the one-issue magazine &quot;The Recluse&quot;, and copies were widely circulated. It was then partly published in revised serial form in &quot;The Fantasy Fan&quot; in 1933–35. The full revised text first became easily available to the public in &quot;The Outsider and Others&quot; (1939).

==Critical reception==
&quot;An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia&quot; terms the work &quot;HPL&#x27;s most significant literary essay and one of the finest historical analyses of horror literature.&quot; 
After the first publication, the critic Edmund Wilson, who was not an admirer of Lovecraft&#x27;s fiction, praised the recent essay as a &quot;really able piece of work... he had read comprehensively in this field—he was strong on the Gothic novelists—and writes about it with much intelligence&quot;. David G. Hartwell has called &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot; &quot;the most important essay on horror literature&quot;.

<doc id="543308" wikidata="Q1248905" url="?curid=543308" title="The Danny Thomas Show">
<text>The Danny Thomas Show (titled Make Room for Daddy for its first three seasons) is an American sitcom that ran from 1953 to 1957 on ABC and from 1957 to 1964 on CBS. Starring Danny Thomas as a successful night club entertainer, the show focused on his relationship with his family, yet went through a number of significant changes in cast and characters during the course of its run. Episodes regularly featured music by Thomas, guest stars and occasionally other cast members as part of the plot.

In March 1953, Thomas first signed the contract for the show with ABC and chose Desilu Studios to film it using its three-camera method. Two proposed titles during pre-production were &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; and &quot;Here Comes Daddy&quot;.

==Synopsis==

Thomas played the role of Danny Williams, a successful comedian and nightclub entertainer at the Copa Club, based on the iconic New York City nightclub the Copacabana. In the show&#x27;s first iteration as &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;, Jean Hagen played Thomas&#x27; serious and loving wife Margaret. Their daughter Terry was played by Sherry Jackson and their son Rusty by Rusty Hamer. The show&#x27;s premise involved Danny rarely having time to spend with his family and Margaret having to deal with the children virtually on her own. She often felt neglected by Danny, and on several occasions felt like leaving him. Margaret was a society woman and strict with the children, but loved her family.

Louise Beavers made several appearances during this era as the Williams&#x27; maid, Louise Evans, and often was at odds with Danny and sided with Margaret in most of the couple&#x27;s arguments. Nana Bryant often appeared as Margaret&#x27;s kind mother Julia, of whom Danny and the children were fond, but Margaret, who had been raised by her aunt and uncle because of her mother often being away on stage tours, was not as warm to her mother. (Bryant died in late 1955, and rather than the character being recast, she simply disappeared. When Louise Beavers became ill in 1955, Amanda Randolph assumed the role of Louise.)

==Episodes==

== Background and production ==
For its first three years the show was titled &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; (retitled &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; starting with season four) and garnered decent ratings, but failed to make the list of the top 30 programs. Shortly after the third season finished filming, Jean Hagen left the show over dissatisfaction with her role and frequent clashes with Danny Thomas. Thomas was upset with her for leaving, and felt the show would not last without her. However, he decided to push on. At the start of the fourth season, both Thomas and producer Sheldon Leonard were faced with a serious dilemma—how to explain Hagen&#x27;s absence. To have &quot;Danny&quot; and &quot;Margaret&quot; divorce in that era would have been unacceptable to television audiences, so it was explained that Margaret had died suddenly off-screen. It was a risky move because until this time, no character on a TV situation comedy had died.

Danny was now a widower juggling a performing career while raising two children on his own. With the absence of Jean Hagen, character actress-comedienne Mary Wickes (who had worked with Thomas and singer-actress Doris Day in the 1952 Warner Bros. musical film &quot;I&#x27;ll See You in My Dreams&quot;) was cast in the recurring role of Liz O&#x27;Neill, Danny Williams&#x27;s no-nonsense press agent. Wickes remained with the show until 1958. During the show&#x27;s fourth season, it was Liz, along with Louise and Danny&#x27;s friends, who often looked after the children while he was touring. He decided to move them to a boarding school, but later relented and the family moved into a new apartment. Also in that year, Danny dated a few other women and nearly got engaged to a widowed singer until he found out she did not like children. By season&#x27;s end, the ratings had suffered and it was decided that a wife and mother was needed to complete the family unit.
In a four-part story arc that began airing in April 1957, son Rusty fell ill with the measles and Danny hired Kathy O&#x27;Hara (Marjorie Lord), a young Irish nurse, to look after him. Kathy was a widow with a little girl (played by Leilani Sorenson). Danny and Kathy became fast friends and, not surprisingly, Danny quickly fell in love with her, as did the kids. In the season finale, the two became engaged. In a curious twist, ABC at this point canceled the series. In the spring of 1957, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, which had reigned as the top-rated show for almost all of its six-year run on CBS, was ending production. When CBS heard that ABC was cancelling the series, CBS picked it up as part of its 1957-58 schedule.

&quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; made its CBS debut on Monday, October 7, 1957, at 9:00 inheriting the time slot vacated by &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. The fifth-season premiere episode, &quot;Lose Me In Las Vegas&quot;, had Danny and Kathy already married and on their honeymoon. The Williams family moved into a larger brand-new apartment and, with the change of network, the producers also changed Kathy&#x27;s daughter. Leilani Sorenson was dropped from the cast and replaced by Angela Cartwright as Linda. Linda then was adopted by Danny, and the show&#x27;s ratings dramatically increased. At the end of its fifth season, &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; posted its highest rating, ranking at No. 2. During this season, Amanda Randolph was sick and rarely appeared as Louise, who was said to be recovering from the flu, with Kathy doing most of the housework.

In the early part of the sixth season, Sherry Jackson left the show and the character of Terry was said to have gone to a girls school in Paris. Jackson commented on her close friendship with Jean Hagen and why she left the series:

The major perk was Jean Hagen. I adored her. We had a great time. She and I were best buddies; she was my only friend from the &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; cast. What made me specifically want to leave the show? I had a five-year contract, Jean had a three-year contract. Jean was thoroughly fed up with the series and made it clear that she didn&#x27;t want to come back. When she left, I was devastated. I didn&#x27;t want to continue, either. I wanted to break my contract. They wouldn&#x27;t let me leave, but gave me less to do; that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m in fewer shows from ages 14–16.

In Season 7, the character of Terry was brought back, but recast with Penney Parker. Terry was featured in a seven-episode story arc that had her engaged and eventually married to Pat Hannigan (Pat Harrington, Jr.), a nightclub friend of Danny&#x27;s. After the wedding, the Hannigans moved to California and Terry was rarely mentioned, never to be seen on the show again.

In the last two seasons, with Thomas and Lord tired of their roles, Danny and Kathy both regularly traveled, and for much of the tenth season they toured Europe (with a handful of episodes featuring location footage). Rusty and Linda were looked after by Danny&#x27;s manager, Charlie Halper (Sid Melton) and his wife Bunny (Pat Carroll). During the 11th and final season, Thomas decided to retire from the show and the program ended in the spring of 1964, finishing as still one of the most popular television programs and ranking at number nine.
=== Music ===
The theme music, which went through various arrangements over the course of the show, was based of the traditional Irish song &quot;Danny Boy&quot;.

== Broadcast ==

=== Syndication ===

Reruns of the show (using the original title, &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot;) were aired weekdays on NBC from October 4, 1960, to March 26, 1965. The episodes shown were from season one through season nine. CBS aired primetime repeats April 19 through September 6, 1965, on Monday nights at 9:30 p.m (Eastern time). Subsequently, most of the CBS episodes were then syndicated in the fall of 1967 and offered to local stations. The first four seasons from ABC were not put into syndication.

From February 1, 1987 to 1991, the show&#x27;s fifth through ninth seasons were shown on Nick at Nite. TV Land and GoodLife Television aired the majority of the episodes from the fourth season through the seventh season (and select episodes from seasons eight and nine).

The show aired on Lifestyle until the channel ceased operations in 1993. 

MeTV aired the show from Labor Day of 2012 to December 31, 2014.

In 2014, the series joined the weekday line up of Cozi TV, where it has, as of 2021, stopped airing but did broadcast all the 1956–1964 episodes which includes the season after Jean Hagen left the show (1956–1957). Cozi-TV also added the final two seasons of the show (Seasons 10 and 11) that had not been shown in any package of reruns since 1965.

Episodes of the show can be seen on TVS Nostalgia Network.Com. Season 5 (only) is available on Hulu. Amazon Prime and Filmrise are streaming the show currently (April 2024). The Catchy Comedy network currently airs one episode every weekday as of November 2024.

George Carlin referred to the reruns as &quot;Daddy has had room made for&quot;.
=== Home media ===
On September 28, 2004, Questar released the complete fifth season on Region 1 DVD. The set includes two special episodes: the fourth-season finale, &quot;Danny&#x27;s Proposal&quot;, and the pilot for &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;.

The complete sixth season on DVD was released on January 22. 2008. It was released by a different company than the one that had handled the fifth-season package, and contained uncut episodes with vintage second-run opening titles from the early 1960s NBC network daytime reruns.
Season four was released on DVD in 2020.
Several of the early episodes with Jean Hagen can be purchased on discount DVDs, as these episodes have entered public domain because of lapsed copyright.
 Season 4 has been available on DVD since 2022.

==Media information==

=== Spinoff and crossovers ===
The series played a role in the creation of another long-running sitcom, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. In the seventh season, Danny Thomas is arrested by Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith) and detained in the small town of Mayberry in an episode titled &quot;Danny Meets Andy Griffith&quot;. The episode aired on February 15, 1960, and &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; premiered later that year on October 3.

&quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot; originated as a back-door pilot aired as an episode of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; titled &quot;Everything Happens to Me&quot;, aired on March 27, 1961. Though Bishop&#x27;s show went through a series of changes, the characters of Danny and Rusty appeared in several &quot;Joey Bishop Show&quot; episodes over its four-year run, with Rusty appearing on the show for a three-episode arc in early 1965, about a year after &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; itself had wound down. Kathy and Charlie Halper also appeared in one episode of &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;.

The series also crossed over to &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot; In the 1958 &quot;Lucy–Desi&quot; episode &quot;Lucy Makes Room for Danny&quot;, the Williams (Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Rusty Hamer and Angela Cartwright) rent Lucy and Ricky Ricardo&#x27;s house. Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz subsequently appeared as the Ricardos on an episode of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; (&quot;Lucy Upsets the Williams Household&quot;) which aired on January 5, 1959.

Morey Amsterdam guest-starred as Buddy Sorrell of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; in the episode &quot;The Woman Behind the Jokes&quot;, season 11, episode 4.

Eight episodes of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; (in seasons 8-10) featured Bill Dana as José Jiménez. This led to the spin-off series &quot;The Bill Dana Show&quot;, starring Dana as Jiménez. Danny Thomas played himself in one episode of &quot;The Bill Dana Show&quot;.

=== Sequel ===

The show ended in 1964, but Danny Thomas, Marjorie Lord, Angela Cartwright, Rusty Hamer, Sherry Jackson, Amanda Randolph and Hans Conried returned in 1965 for a two-hour-long &quot;reunion&quot; special on NBC, &quot;The Danny Thomas TV Family Reunion&quot;, considered the first TV reunion show, and &quot;Make More Room for Daddy&quot;, which aired as an episode of &quot;The Danny Thomas Hour&quot; in November 1967. Shortly after filming the second special in 1967, Randolph died suddenly of a stroke at the age of 70. A CBS reunion special, &quot;Make Room for Granddaddy&quot;, was aired in 1969. The special did so well that it was picked up as a series by CBS, but Thomas considered its assigned time slot to be too quiet and pulled the show.

ABC brought it back on a weekly basis in 1970, in &quot;Make Room for Granddaddy&quot;. For the series premiere, Sherry Jackson reprised her role of oldest daughter Terry. No mention was made of her husband Pat Hannigan. Instead, for this new version of the series, Terry&#x27;s husband was named Bill, who was a soldier. In this episode, Terry left her son, six-year-old Michael (played by Michael Hughes), in the care of grandparents Danny and Kathy so she could join Bill, who was stationed overseas. In addition to Lord, Hamer and Cartwright, the only other returning regulars were Sid Melton as Charley Halper and Hans Conried as Uncle Tonoose. During that season, new characters were played by Stanley Myron Handelman and former football player Roosevelt Grier. Pat Carroll did not reprise her role of Bunny Halper. The show lasted only one year, producing 24 episodes; its cancellation came at a time when the networks were purging content favoring older, rural and other less affluent viewers after the loss of a half-hour of daily program time in 1971. According to Lord, the series faced many obstacles, including the unprofessionalism and inexperience of the child actor Michael Hughes, the absence of Sheldon Leonard as producer/director to control Thomas and improve the quality of the scripts, and the fact that ABC switched the time slot of the show from Wednesday nights at 8:00 pm to Thursday nights at 9:00 pm. As a result, the ratings went from mediocre to poor.

The band&#x27;s only constant members are Omar Rodríguez-López (guitar, producer, direction) and Cedric Bixler-Zavala (vocals, lyrics), whose partnership forms the core of the band. The band&#x27;s current line-up also includes founding member Eva Gardner (bass), Omar&#x27;s brother Marcel Rodríguez-López (keyboards, synths, percussion), Leo Genovese (piano, keyboard) and Linda-Philomène Tsoungui (drums). 

Known for their energetic live shows and concept albums, The Mars Volta formed following the break-up of Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s previous band, At the Drive-In. Seeking to experiment and expand their sound, Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala recruited Gardner, Isaiah &quot;Ikey&quot; Owens (keyboards), Jon Theodore (drums) and Jeremy Ward (sound manipulation) to form The Mars Volta. The band released their debut EP, &quot;Tremulant&quot;, in 2002, with Gardner leaving the band prior to recording their debut album, &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;. She was replaced by Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; bass guitarist Flea for the sessions. The Rick Rubin-produced album received widespread critical acclaim upon its release in 2003.

The band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; (2005), was self-produced by Rodríguez-López and was the first to feature longterm members Juan Alderete (bass) and Marcel Rodríguez-López. The album debuted at #4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and became the band&#x27;s biggest commercial success, selling over 500,000 copies in the US and achieving Gold certification from the RIAA. The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Amputechture&quot;, was released in 2006 and was the last album to feature Theodore. In 2008, the band released &quot;The Bedlam in Goliath&quot;, a concept album inspired by the band&#x27;s turbulent experiences with a ouija-type talking board. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Wax Simulacra&quot; was awarded a Grammy Award in 2009 for Best Hard Rock Performance. The band released its fifth album, &quot;Octahedron&quot;, in June 2009. 

Following the release of their sixth album, &quot;Noctourniquet&quot; (2012), and a run of reunion shows with At the Drive-In, The Mars Volta entered a hiatus in September 2012. Rodríguez-López subsequently formed a new project, Bosnian Rainbows, and the band formally broke up after disagreements between Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala. The duo repaired their friendship and reunited in 2014 for a new project, Antemasque, and further At the Drive-In tours and recording sessions.

Reuniting in secret in 2019, Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala recorded a new studio album, &quot;The Mars Volta&quot;, with Gardner, Marcel Rodríguez-López and drummer Willy Rodriguez Quiñones. The band announced their reunion – after ten years of public inactivity – with an art installation called L&#x27;ytome Hodorxí Telesterion, in June 2022. For the band&#x27;s live return, jazz pianist Leo Genovese and drummer Linda-Philomène Tsoungui were added to the line-up.

==History==
===Formation and beginning (2001–2002)===

The roots of The Mars Volta are found in the band At the Drive-In. ATDI imploded on the verge of a commercial breakthrough, partly due to boredom, partly to musical differences. Members Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodríguez-López began to further explore their experimental, dub-influenced side project called De Facto, which featured Bixler-Zavala on drums, Rodríguez-López on bass, Isaiah &quot;Ikey&quot; Owens on keyboards, and Jeremy Ward on vocals, loops and sound effects.

During 2001 Eva Gardner joined the members of De Facto on bass, and they recorded two songs with drummer Blake Fleming and producer Alex Newport, which became the first demo by The Mars Volta. The lineup for their first public show at Chain Reaction in Anaheim, California was Rodríguez-López, Bixler-Zavala, Owens, Gardner, Ward, and drummer Jon Theodore. This lineup recorded three more tracks with Alex Newport, which became the EP &quot;Tremulant&quot;, released in early 2002 by Gold Standard Laboratories.

After the demise of At the Drive-In, Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala found themselves once again starting from the ground up, touring and performing in smaller venues. In their early years The Mars Volta were characterized by chaotic live shows and heavy drug use.

===&quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot; (2003–2004)===

Following &quot;Tremulant&quot;, The Mars Volta continued touring with a fluid line-up while preparing to record their debut full-length album &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;, produced with Rick Rubin and released on June 24, 2003. Whereas &quot;Tremulant&quot; had no general theme (except the prophetic mentioning) &quot;De-Loused&quot; was a unified work of speculative fiction telling the first-person story of someone in a drug-induced coma, battling the evil side of his mind. Though lyrically obscure, The Mars Volta stated in interviews that the album&#x27;s protagonist is based on their late friend Julio Venegas, or &quot;Cerpin Taxt&quot;, an El Paso poet and artist who went into a coma for several years after a deliberate drug overdose, recovered and later committed suicide. He died jumping from the Mesa Street overpass onto Interstate-10 in El Paso during afternoon rush-hour traffic. (Venegas&#x27; death was also referenced in the At the Drive-In song &quot;Embroglio&quot; from their album &quot;Acrobatic Tenement&quot;.)

In an interview with &quot;The Aquarian Weekly&quot; in 2008, Bixler-Zavala said about working with Rubin, &quot;Rick really over-simplified some of the parts that we thought were unique, and just made them very digestible. He&#x27;s got this thing about representing the common man&#x27;s ears—I&#x27;d rather jab the common man&#x27;s ears. If we don&#x27;t, we&#x27;ll never get to a place where future music exists.&quot;

The Mars Volta had no official bassist during the recording session, but Flea (of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) played bass on nine of the album&#x27;s ten songs, with Justin Meldal-Johnsen playing double bass on &quot;Televators&quot;. Flea&#x27;s bandmate John Frusciante also contributed additional guitar, synthesizer and backing vocals to &quot;Cicatriz ESP&quot;. After several temporary replacements, a permanent bassist for the band was found in Juan Alderete (formerly of Racer X).

Despite limited promotion, &quot;De-Loused&quot; earned strong reviews, and appeared on several &#x27;year-end best-of&#x27; lists. The album remains The Mars Volta&#x27;s best-seller, with over 500,000 copies sold. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked a track from &quot;De-Loused&quot;, &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns&quot;, the 91st Best Guitar Song Ever. The band later released a limited-edition storybook version of the album, available by download from the Gold Standard Laboratories website. The book speaks of Cerpin Taxt (Julio Venegas) and his suicide.

While on tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers in support of the album, founding member Jeremy Ward died of a heroin overdose. The band had canceled the tour&#x27;s second leg, and the first single from &quot;De-Loused&quot; was later dedicated to Ward. It was this event which finally convinced band leaders Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala to purportedly quit using opioids. Bixler-Zavala recalled: &quot;One day, we were all getting high, and Jeremy asked me if I could see he had worms in his head. I never touched the stuff again. His passing was the final nail in the coffin. We never went back.&quot;

===&quot;Frances the Mute&quot; (2005)===

As the band resumed touring to support &quot;De-Loused&quot;, they added Marcel Rodríguez-López (Omar&#x27;s brother) on percussion. Work on their second album began in 2004. That year the band received the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers Vanguard Award.

In 2005, the band released &quot;Frances the Mute&quot;. The story given by the band on the album&#x27;s concept concerns a diary that had been found in a repossessed car by late sound technician Jeremy Ward, while working as a repo-man. The author of the diary is unknown but appeared to be someone who was adopted and was searching for their birth parents, and who may have suffered from mental illness caused by the death of a loved one. The lyrics for each track on the album are loosely based on characters and life events described in this person&#x27;s diary.

&quot;Frances the Mute&quot; started as a bigger commercial hit than &quot;De-Loused&quot;, moving 123,000 copies in its first week, and debuting at No. 4 on the Billboard album charts. Reviews of &quot;Frances&quot; were generally positive (with a 75 on Metacritic) if somewhat polarized; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;a feverish and baroque search for self that conjures up the same majesty and gravity as Led Zeppelin three decades before&quot;, and even the detractors of &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; generally praised the band&#x27;s musical abilities. &quot;L&#x27;Via L&#x27;Viaquez&quot; was later released as the 12 minute B-side to &quot;The Bible And The Breathalyzer&quot; single, a song which did not appear on the album. &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; has sold nearly 465,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan ratings.

Rodríguez-López wrote all of the instrumental parts as well as arranging and producing the recording sessions himself. He used a method that Miles Davis used to evoke great performances from bandmates: refusing to let the other members hear each other&#x27;s parts, or the context of their own part, thereby forcing them to play each part as if it were a self-sufficient song. In order to accomplish this, the musicians recorded to the pulse of a metronome. While in the studio, Rodríguez-López recruited Adrián Terrazas-González to play saxophone, flute, and additional wind instruments for the album. Terrazas-González was added as a permanent member to The Mars Volta while touring in support of &quot;Frances the Mute&quot;.

Several songs written during the original recording sessions for the album never made the final cut. Notably, the self-titled 14-minute epic &quot;Frances the Mute&quot;, which was originally to open the album and was ultimately supposed to decode the album&#x27;s concept, was not included due to time constraints. Instead the track was featured as a b-side to the single release for &quot;The Widow&quot;.

On May 21, 2005, instead of playing a traditional set at KROQ&#x27;s Weenie Roast Festival, the band played a 50-minute improvisation jam that was jokingly named on-the-spot as &quot;Abortion, The Other White Meat&quot; by Rodríguez-López. In keeping with The Mars Volta&#x27;s tradition of testing and developing new work live, parts of &quot;Abortion&quot; later appeared on &quot;Population Council&#x27;s Wet Dream&quot; from Rodríguez-López&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Old Money&quot;.

Midway through their headlining U.S. tour, former At the Drive-In member Paul Hinojos left the band Sparta to join The Mars Volta, claiming, &quot;My time with Sparta has run its course, and simply wasn&#x27;t fun anymore.&quot; Hinojos joined as live rhythm guitarist and became the band&#x27;s sound manipulator, the position previously held by the late Ward. Hinojos had previously toured with The Mars Volta in 2003 and 2004.

During mid-2005, the band toured in support of the album with System of a Down and curated the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival at Camber Sands in England. In addition, a full-length live album named &quot;Scabdates&quot; was released on November 8, 2005.

===&quot;Amputechture&quot; (2006–2007)===

Upon finishing the majority of touring for &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; in fall 2005, Rodríguez-López traveled to Amsterdam and wrote what became &quot;Amputechture&quot;, which was released on September 8, 2006, in Europe, on September 9, 2006, in Australia and on September 12, 2006, in the U.S. Rodríguez-López spent much of his time in Amsterdam working on and performing various solo projects most notably under the name &quot;Omar Rodriguez Quintet&quot;. During this time Rodríguez-López also composed the score to the film &quot;El Búfalo de la Noche&quot;, which was written and directed by Guillermo Arriaga and Jorge Hernandez Aldana respectively. The Mars Volta as a whole performed the score.

&quot;Amputechture&quot; was produced by Rodríguez-López and mixed by Rich Costey. Jeff Jordan provided the artwork, making it their first album not to feature the work of Storm Thorgerson. It was once again a concept album, but rather than telling a story, the album was a series of vignettes, with each song telling a different story. It became the last album with drummer Jon Theodore, whom Rodríguez-López fired before touring in support of the album. Rodríguez-López said in an interview with an Italian fan site that Theodore was the only member in the band who was not happy playing live and brought down the moods of the rest.
John Frusciante was featured on every track on &quot;Amputechture&quot;, except for &quot;Asilos Magdalena&quot;. Rodríguez-López contributed the solos and riffs where the guitar work needed to be doubled. Bixler-Zavala said in an interview, &quot;...he taught Frusciante all the new songs and Frusciante tracked guitars for us so Omar could sit back and listen to the songs objectively. It&#x27;s great that he wants to help us and do that.&quot;

On July 28, 2006, the drummer&#x27;s spot was filled by Blake Fleming, formerly of Laddio Bolocko, Dazzling Killmen, and the very first Mars Volta demos. A new song titled &quot;Rapid Fire Tollbooth&quot; was debuted live on September 22, 2006, in Chicago, Illinois, as reported by fans and attendees of the show who had received set lists from the stage. The song originally appears on Rodríguez-López&#x27;s solo album &quot;Se Dice Bisonte, No Búfalo&quot;. The song eventually evolved into the track &quot;Goliath&quot; from the band&#x27;s fourth studio album.

On September 25, 2006, The Mars Volta played a unique set on the opening night of a double-header in Toronto, Ontario. Cedric Bixler-Zavala fell ill and could not perform, so The Mars Volta played with John Frusciante on third guitar. The set consisted of over 47 minutes of instrumental material, including a lengthy cover of the Pink Floyd composition &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;. On October 17, 2006, while opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the band played with drummer Deantoni Parks as Rodríguez-López had fired Fleming because of complications within the band. Parks remained with the band only until the conclusion of the Japanese tour because of his prior commitments with other bands. On October 31, 2006, in Cleveland, Ohio, as Parks could not perform, The Mars Volta played an approximately 40-minute improvisation set as a rehearsal for another drummer, Thomas Pridgen.

On a 2006 episode of The Henry Rollins Show, The Mars Volta performed &quot;Tetragrammaton&quot; and &quot;Day of the Baphomets&quot; in a rare television performance. Afterwards, they did an interview with Rollins about the creation of &quot;Amputechture&quot;.

===&quot;The Bedlam in Goliath&quot; (2008)===
In 2007, Thomas Pridgen became the new permanent drummer for the band. Pridgen&#x27;s first full-time appearance was at the March 12 show in New Zealand, where the band debuted the song &quot;Idle Tooth&quot; which was later renamed &quot;Wax Simulacra&quot; for the forthcoming album. After shows in New Zealand and Australia, The Mars Volta toured a few West Coast venues as the headliner, then entered the studio to record their fourth LP, &quot;The Bedlam in Goliath&quot;. One of these performances was captured in a live concert DVD (which remains unreleased) shot by director Jorge Hernandez Aldana.

Despite finding a permanent drummer and getting the band back on track, the recording and production of the album was reportedly plagued by difficulties related to a bad experience with a Ouija board purchased in a curio shop in Jerusalem. According to Rodríguez-López, their original engineer experienced a nervous breakdown, his studio flooded twice, and both he and mixer Rich Costey claimed that various tracks would disappear at random.

On November 5, 2007, The Mars Volta released a document by Jeremy Robert Johnson titled, &quot;The Mars Volta&#x27;s Descent into Bedlam: A Rhapsody in Three Parts&quot;. The document includes a history of the band and describes the obstacles and inspirations they encountered in the creation of &quot;The Bedlam in Goliath&quot;. On November 20, 2007 &quot;Wax Simulacra&quot;, the first single from the forthcoming album, was released with a cover of &quot;Pulled to Bits&quot; by Siouxsie and the Banshees as the b-side.

The band kicked off their supporting tour with a December 29, 2007 &quot;secret show&quot; at the Echoplex in Los Angeles, California, followed by a special New Year&#x27;s Eve performance at San Francisco&#x27;s Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. That night they played their first ever acoustic set, which included six songs and a live performance of &quot;Miranda, That Ghost Just Isn&#x27;t Holy Anymore&quot;. The band then departed on a club tour of the U.S. east coast throughout January, with an album release show at San Diego&#x27;s Soma, followed by another month&#x27;s worth of European dates from mid-February to mid-March.

On January 2, 2008, The Mars Volta released an online game called &quot;Goliath: The Soothsayer&quot;, based on a true story that inspired their forthcoming album &quot;The Bedlam In Goliath&quot;. The album chronicles the band&#x27;s purported experience with the &quot;Soothsayer&quot;, a Ouija board owned by vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala and its transition from a source of fun on tour to a psycho-spiritual force that almost tore the band apart. The game was available for a limited time exclusively via Amazon.com.

On January 17, 2008, the band made their U.S. network television debut, performing &quot;Wax Simulacra&quot; on the Late Show with David Letterman (Rodríguez-López, Bixler-Zavala and Hinojos had appeared on the show with At the Drive-In in 2000). On January 22, they made a surprise appearance at Toronto, Ontario, Canada&#x27;s MTV Live studios, where they performed &quot;Wax Simulacra&quot; and an extended version of &quot;Goliath&quot;. In late January, the new album debuted at a career-best No. 3 on the Billboard 200.

The song &quot;Wax Simulacra&quot; won the 2009 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. It was the band&#x27;s first nomination and win. The band members thanked their families and Bixler urged people not to forget the memories of the recently departed Lux Interior and Ron Asheton.

===&quot;Octahedron&quot; (2009–2010)===
Omar Rodríguez-López had discussed the band&#x27;s next album as early as January 2008, the month that &quot;The Bedlam in Goliath&quot; was released, claiming &quot;I consider it to be our acoustic album.&quot; Cedric Bixler-Zavala had expressed an urge for the album to not be released on a major label. In February 2009, Rodríguez-López claimed &quot;the next two Mars Volta records are already recorded and waiting for a release date.&quot;

On April 14, 2009, The Mars Volta announced their fifth studio album, entitled &quot;Octahedron&quot;. It was released June 23 in the United States and June 22 in the rest of the world. A vinyl version was released on July 21 in a limited edition of 500 LPs. In the spirit of distillation of the band&#x27;s sound, Rodríguez-López asked woodwind player/percussionist Adrián Terrazas-González and live rhythm guitarist/sound manipulator Paul Hinojos to leave. Regarding their departure, percussionist Marcel Rodríguez-López noted that: &quot;it&#x27;s like we got a whole new band. It&#x27;s two less members – we got to play differently.&quot;

The first single released in North America was &quot;Since We&#x27;ve Been Wrong&quot;. The first European single was &quot;Cotopaxi&quot;.

An excerpt from The Mars Volta&#x27;s performance at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties, UK 2005 A Nightmare Before Christmas festival was featured in the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties film, which was released in cinemas during October 2009.

During the Octahedron tour, the show on October 23 in Raleigh, NC was unexpectedly cancelled. It was supposed to be the final show of the North American leg of the tour, but was cancelled due to an argument between Bixler-Zavala and Thomas Pridgen, the drummer at the time, which ended with Pridgen abruptly leaving the venue. A month later, Pridgen confirmed his departure from The Mars Volta via Facebook stating he was &quot;not in TMV anymore&quot;. In a February 2011 interview, Pridgen said he left the group &quot;because the singer had a jealous ego trip. There&#x27;s nothing more to elaborate on&quot;; however, Juan Alderete stated in 2013 that &quot;Thomas got really drunk, did some bad things and did some real damage to the trust we all had with him.&quot; The band later completed the tour with drummer Dave Elitch. They played throughout Europe and Australia until the end of January 2010.

In October 2010, The Mars Volta played two shows in Brazil and Chile. Long-time keyboardist, Ikey Owens, was absent during these dates due to touring commitments with his own project, Free Moral Agents.

===&quot;Noctourniquet&quot; (2011–2012)===

Shortly after &quot;Octahedron&quot;″s release, Rodríguez-López claimed to have put the supposed follow-up &quot;on hold&quot; and was starting work on a completely new album. In an April 2010 interview with Rolling Stone, Rodríguez-López talked about trying to loosen his grip in the studio. He claimed to have finished writing the album, and was awaiting lyrics and vocals from Bixler-Zavala. Rodríguez-López spent most of 2010 focusing on his solo career, and little information regarding the sixth Mars Volta album was released. During this year drummer Deantoni Parks began touring with Rodríguez-López as well as appearing on several solo records, and Cathy Pellow of Sargent House Records confirmed that Parks was in talks to become the next drummer for The Mars Volta.

In 2011, Rodríguez-López spoke about the band&#x27;s new album in several interviews, saying that it would feature thirteen songs which, &quot;[are] a simplified version of what we&#x27;ve done before&quot;, and would be released &quot;Whenever the record label decides to put it out&quot;. Bixler-Zavala took the opportunity to make a few remarks on the sound of the album, indicating a drastic change in sound for the band, referring to the new sound as &quot;future punk&quot;.

On March 19, 2011, the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group performed at SXSW. Bixler-Zavala joined the group as a vocalist, performing entirely new material with the band, which led to speculations of the show being a secret Mars Volta show under the Omar Rodríguez-López Group moniker. The Group continued to tour throughout April with the same lineup of Bixler-Zavala, Omar and Marcel Rodríguez-López, Juan Alderete, Deantoni Parks and (previously offstage) keyboardist/sound manipulator Lars Stalfors. An official Mars Volta tour began in summer of 2011, consisting of them opening for Soundgarden on select dates. This was in addition to their opening slot for the Red Hot Chili Peppers in their one-off gig in Hong Kong on August 9, 2011. During these shows the band (featuring the same six members) continued to play the new material premiered during the Omar Rodríguez-López Group tour earlier in the year, with Bixler-Zavala telling the crowd at one show that he was &quot;inviting them to a private rehearsal for their new album,&quot; confirming the material was off the band&#x27;s upcoming album.

Keyboardist Ikey Owens, who had played with the band since its inception, was noticeably absent from all 2011 dates. When asked in an interview, Owens stated that he knew &quot;Absolutely nothing [of the upcoming album]. I haven&#x27;t heard one note of it; I haven&#x27;t played on it. I don&#x27;t know if I am going to play on it; I have no idea&quot;. Bassist Juan Alderete later revealed via his Twitter page that Owens was no longer playing with The Mars Volta as he was busy &quot;producing bands&quot;. Marcel Rodríguez-López and Lars Stalfors took over keyboard and synth duties with the band in lieu of Owens.

On January 5, 2012, a new song titled &quot;Zed and Two Naughts&quot;, a song revealed to be from the band&#x27;s upcoming album, was confirmed to be included on the MLB 12: The Show Soundtrack.

On January 12, it was revealed that the upcoming album would be called &quot;Noctourniquet&quot;. Later that week, an official page went up confirming &quot;Noctourniquet&quot; as the album title along with unveiling the album art and a full track listing and announcing March 27, 2012 as the release date. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Malkin Jewel,&quot; was first broadcast on February 13 and subsequently released on February 14.

===Hiatus, breakup, and reunion rumors (2013–2021)===
After the conclusion of the &quot;Noctourniquet&quot; tour, Omar Rodríguez-López decided to put The Mars Volta on hold to fully concentrate on his new project, Bosnian Rainbows, which also features Deantoni Parks. When asked in an interview if the band will reunite, he stated:

I don&#x27;t know, and I&#x27;m not insecure enough to have to ask myself that. It&#x27;s like, we&#x27;ve done that for ten years, eleven years. Now we&#x27;re all doing different things, and everything that we&#x27;re doing informs how we express ourselves, and so if that happens then it happens and if it doesn&#x27;t it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not something to be worried about. It shouldn&#x27;t occupy a space in the mind. There&#x27;s way too many things that are much too important to occupy space in the mind.

On January 23, 2013, Cedric Bixler-Zavala revealed that he was no longer a part of The Mars Volta on Twitter and that the band had broken up.

Bixler-Zavala subsequently focused on his solo music and eventually formed a new band, Zavalaz, which also includes Juan Alderete. He stated shortly after that he was &quot;currently not on speaking terms&quot; with Rodríguez-López and that &quot;the falling out had been four years in the making, so the final announcement on my part was really just to let the children know that Mom and Dad were splitting up&quot;.

Rodríguez-López, meanwhile, did not rule out the possibility of The Mars Volta reuniting in the future: &quot;Because of all my anger and how I dealt with people, I spent so much of my life just closing doors left and right. At this point, I refuse to close any, only to open new ones. Whatever comes my way - as long as it&#x27;s filled with joy and positivity - I want to give my talents to it. [...] I&#x27;m not interested in throwing tantrums any more.&quot; He elaborated further on an article with Billboard, acknowledging Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s decision to depart TMV, effectively ending the over 20 year musical partnership between Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala for the foreseeable future. Rodríguez-López stated, &quot;I was making a film and heard about it hours later; people were like, &#x27;Are you OK?&#x27; I understand where he&#x27;s coming from; I&#x27;ve known the guy for 22 years. I&#x27;ll always respect and support any decision he makes. If that&#x27;s how he wants it, I totally get it and I support it.&quot;

In August 2013, a collection of unreleased songs, demos, alternate versions, and in-studio jams roughly spanning from 2005 until the &quot;Noctourniquet&quot; sessions was leaked online. The source of these recordings still remains unknown.

In February 2014, several posts on the Comatorium message board by sources close to the band revealed that Bixler-Zavala and Rodríguez-López had been meeting and speaking again, hinting at a possible Mars Volta reunion. The rumors were further fueled when Bixler-Zavala&#x27;s wife Chrissie posted a picture on Instagram of her husband and Rodríguez-López holding Bixler&#x27;s twin boys at a California beach. On April 9, a new project featuring Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala, Antemasque was announced; Antemasque also featured Flea on bass and Dave Elitch on drums.

On October 14, 2014, founding member Isaiah &quot;Ikey&quot; Owens was found dead in his hotel room while on tour in Mexico with Jack White. According to a representative, Owens died of a heart attack.

In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on July 11, 2016, when asked about a potential return of The Mars Volta, Rodriguez-Lopez stated, &quot;At some point, we&#x27;d love to do [Mars Volta] again too, you know what I mean? There&#x27;s so much to do there as well.&quot; In February 2018, Bixler-Zavala confirmed on Twitter that The Mars Volta will &quot;be back soon&quot;, but later clarified that At the Drive-In activity will take precedence for the immediate future. In May 2019, further tweeting from Bixler-Zavala suggested he and Rodríguez-López had been experimenting with new material.

On February 23, 2021, Hamburg based label Clouds Hill Group announced they had acquired rights to handle the band&#x27;s discography, as well as Omar Rodriguez-Lopez&#x27; entire back catalogue, with official reissues of both discographies expected.

On March 4, 2021, Clouds Hill posted a video on Twitter titled &#x27;Coming Soon&#x27;, featuring audio from &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot;, as well as alternate artwork of the album cover. This was later confirmed as the 18-LP box set of the band&#x27;s entire discography titled &quot;La Realidad de Los Sueños&quot; (&quot;The Reality of Dreams&quot;), including unreleased material from the &quot;De-Loused in the Comatorium&quot; sessions titled &quot;Landscape Tantrums&quot;. The set was released on April 23, 2021.

===Reunion, &quot;The Mars Volta&quot; and &quot;Que Dios Te Maldiga Mi Corazón&quot; (2022–present)===

On June 18, 2022, the band revealed the coordinates to a location in Los Angeles, California, where fans were allowed to preview new music from the band via an art installation called &quot;L&#x27;ytome Hodorxí Telesterion&quot;. This was followed up by the release of the single &quot;Blacklight Shine&quot; and a tour announcement, marking both their first new music and first live shows in ten years. The band released a follow-up single &quot;Graveyard Love&quot; on July 8. The band subsequently announced their first album in 10 years, &quot;The Mars Volta&quot;, which was released on September 16. On March 10, 2023, the band announced an acoustic version of their self-titled album titled &quot;Que Dios Te Maldiga Mi Corazón&quot;, which released on April 21.

A documentary film, &quot;Omar and Cedric: If This Ever Gets Weird&quot;, which chronicles Omar and Cedric&#x27;s friendship across several decades, premiered at select film festivals in 2023 and 2024. Directed by Nicolas Jack Davies, the film received a one-day cinematic release on November 20, 2024 across the US.

On February 25, 2025, the band played a set of entirely new songs, believed to be what will comprise their next album.

==Musical style and influences==
The band&#x27;s music has been described as progressive rock, experimental rock and progressive metal.

The band&#x27;s music includes elements from a wide variety of genres, including hardcore, psychedelic rock, and free jazz. Omar Rodríguez-López commented, &quot;Progressive is not a dirty word for people to use about us. If you&#x27;re not moving forward, you&#x27;re stagnant. And that&#x27;s no way to live.&quot; Almost the entire band&#x27;s output was composed solely by Rodríguez-López, with lyrics and vocal melodies written by Cedric Bixler-Zavala. They cited artists/bands such as King Crimson, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Can, Captain Beefheart, Frank Zappa, Larry Harlow, Miles Davis, Fela Kuti, Ennio Morricone, Throbbing Gristle, Talk Talk, Black Flag, Brainiac, Björk, Roni Size, Jaga Jazzist and Aphex Twin as their influences. According to Rodríguez-López, cinema also largely influences his songwriting: &quot;Creating tension, creating flow, creating scenes, creating fast-paced scenes, creating minimal dialogue – it&#x27;s one of our biggest influences&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Many artists and bands have cited The Mars Volta as an influence, including Mastodon, Lizzo, Protest the Hero, Nick Hipa of As I Lay Dying, The Fall of Troy, Danny Marino of The Agonist, Tor Oddmund Suhrke of Leprous, Jonathan Nido of The Ocean, Mutiny on the Bounty, The Old Dead Tree, Canvas Solaris and Syriak of Unexpect.

A number of other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for their work such as Neil Peart of Rush, Tool, Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, James Hetfield of Metallica, Holger Czukay of Can Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater, Lil B, and Kanye West.

In 2008, they were named Best Prog-Rock Band by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.
== Band members ==

<text>A mousetrap is a specialized type of animal trap designed primarily to catch and, usually, kill mice. Mousetraps are usually set in an indoor location where there is a suspected infestation of rodents. Larger traps are designed to catch other species of animals, such as rats, squirrels, and other small rodents.

==Types==

===Jaw mousetrap===

The trap that is credited as the first patented lethal mousetrap was a set of spring-loaded, cast-iron jaws dubbed &quot;Royal No. 1&quot;. It was patented on 4 November 1879 by James M. Keep of New York, US patent 221,320. From the patent description, it is clear that this is not the &quot;first&quot; mousetrap of this type, but the patent is for this simplified, easy-to-manufacture design. It is the industrial-age development of the deadfall trap, but relying on the force of a wound spring rather than gravity.

The jaws are operated by a coiled spring, and the triggering mechanism is between the jaws, where the bait is held. The trip snaps the jaws shut, killing the rodent.

Lightweight traps of this style are now constructed from plastic. These traps do not have a powerful snap like other types. They are safer for the fingers of the person setting them than other lethal traps, and can be set with the press on a tab by a single finger or even by foot.

===Spring-loaded bar mousetrap===
The spring-loaded mousetrap was first patented by William C. Hooker of Abingdon, Illinois, who received US patent 528671 for his design in 1894. A British inventor, James Henry Atkinson, patented a similar trap called the &quot;Little Nipper&quot; in 1898, including variations that had a weight-activated treadle as the trip.
 In 1899, Atkinson patented a modification of his earlier design that transformed it from a trap that goes off by a step on the treadle into one that goes off by a pull on the bait. The similarity of the latter design with Hooker&#x27;s of 1894 may have contributed to a common mistake of giving priority to Atkinson.
It is a simple device with a heavily spring-loaded bar and a trip to release it. Cheese may be placed on the trip as bait, but other food such as oats, chocolate, bread, meat, butter and peanut butter are also used. The spring-loaded bar swings down rapidly and with great force when anything, usually a mouse, touches the trip. The design is such that the mouse&#x27;s neck or spinal cord will be broken, or its ribs or skull crushed, by the force of the bar. The trap can be held over a bin and the dead mouse released into it by pulling the bar. In the case of rats, which are much larger than mice, a much larger version of the same type of trap is used to kill them. Some spring mousetraps have a plastic extended trip. The larger trip has two notable differences over the smaller traditional type: increased leverage, which requires less force from the rodent to trip it; and the larger surface area of the trip increases the probability that the rodent will set off the trap. The exact latching mechanism holding the trip varies, and some need to be set right at the edge in order to be sensitive enough to catch the mouse.

In 1899, John Mast of Lititz, Pennsylvania, filed a U.S. patent for a modification of Hooker&#x27;s design that can be &quot;readily set or adjusted with absolute safety to the person attending thereto, avoiding the liability of having his fingers caught or injured by the striker when it is prematurely or accidentally freed or released.&quot; He obtained the patent on 17 November 1903. After William Hooker had sold his interest in the Animal Trap Company of Abingdon, Illinois, and founded the new Abingdon Trap Company in 1899, the Animal Trap Company moved to Lititz, Pennsylvania, and fused with the J.M. Mast Manufacturing Company in 1905. The new and bigger company in Lititz retained the name Animal Trap Company. Compounding these different but related patents and companies may have contributed to the widespread mis-attribution of priority to Mast rather than Hooker.

===Electric mousetrap===
An electric mousetrap delivers a lethal dose of electricity when the rodent completes the circuit by contacting two electrodes located either at the entrance or between the entrance and the bait. The electrodes are housed in an insulated or plastic box to prevent accidental injury to humans and pets. They can be designed for single-catch domestic use or large multiple-catch commercial use. &quot;See and &quot;.

===Live-capture mousetrap===


An early patented mousetrap is a live capture device patented in 1870 by W K Bachman of South Carolina. These traps have the advantage of allowing the mouse to be released into the wild, or the disadvantage of having to personally kill the captured animal if release is not desired. To ensure a live capture, these traps need to be regularly checked as captured mice can die from stress or starvation. Captured mice need to be released some distance away, as mice have a strong homing instinct. House mice tend to not survive long away from human settlements due to higher levels of predation.

There are many methods to live trap mice. One of the simplest designs consists of a drinking glass placed upside down above a piece of bait, its rim elevated by a coin stood on edge. If the mouse attempts to take the bait, the coin is displaced and the glass traps the mouse. Another method of live trapping, the bucket trap, is to make a half-oval shaped tunnel with a toilet paper roll, put bait on one end of the roll, place the roll on a counter or table with the baited end sticking out over the edge, and put a deep bin under the edge. When the mouse enters the toilet paper roll to take the bait, the roll (and the mouse) will tip over the edge and fall into the bin below; the bin needs to be deep enough to ensure that the mouse cannot jump out.

A style of trap that has been used extensively by researchers in the biological sciences for capturing animals such as mice is the Sherman trap. The Sherman trap folds flat for storage and distribution and when deployed in the field captures the animal, without injury, for examination.

===Glue mousetraps===
Glue traps are made using natural or synthetic adhesive applied to cardboard, plastic trays or similar material. Bait can be placed in the center or a scent may be added to the adhesive by the manufacturer. Glue traps are used primarily for rodent control indoors. Glue traps are not effective outdoors due to environmental conditions (e.g., moisture, dust), which quickly render the adhesive ineffective. Glue strip or glue tray devices trap the mouse in the sticky glue.

Glue traps often do not kill the animal so some people opt to kill the animal before disposing of the trap.
Manufacturers of glue traps usually state that trapped animals should be thrown away with the trap.

Because glue traps do not always kill the animal and often cause them to suffer a slow death, this method of trapping is denounced by animal rights groups and banned in several jurisdictions. Glue traps can be advantageous if the local population of animals have rat mites since the mite will remain on the animal&#x27;s body while it is still alive and the glue would also trap mites leaving the animal after the animal&#x27;s death.

Animals that come into contact with the trap can be released from the glue by applying vegetable oil and gently working the animal free. Glue traps are effective and non-toxic to humans.

====Controversy====
Death is much slower than with the traditional type trap, which has prompted animal activists and welfare organisations such as PETA and the RSPCA to oppose the use of glue traps. Trapped mice eventually die from exposure, dehydration, starvation, suffocation, or predation, or are killed by people when the trap is checked. In some jurisdictions the use of glue traps is regulated. Victoria, Australia restricts the use of glue traps to commercial pest control operators, and the traps must be used in accordance with conditions set by the Minister for Agriculture. Some jurisdictions have banned their use entirely; in Ireland it is illegal to import, possess, sell or offer for sale unauthorized traps, including glue traps. This law, the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, was passed in 2000. The use of glue traps to catch rodents without Ministerial approval has been prohibited in New Zealand since 2015. Uncle Bob&#x27;s Self Storage, the fifth-largest self storage company in the United States, has ended the use of these devices at all its facilities; other companies that have taken similar measures are ING Barings and Charles Schwab Corporation.

===Bucket mousetraps===
Bucket traps may be lethal or non-lethal. Both types have a ramp which leads to the rim of a deep-walled container, such as a bucket. The variations are many with some being single-catch and some multi-catch.

The bucket may contain a liquid to drown the trapped mouse. The mouse is baited to the top of the container where it falls into the bucket and drowns. Sometimes soap or caustic or poison chemicals are used in the bucket as killing agents.

In non-lethal versions, the bucket is usually empty, allowing the mouse to live but keeping it trapped until the owner of the trap can release them.

Another design features a bowl (or similar container) containing a deep layer of vegetable oil, with a ramp leading up to the edge of the bowl. Mice, attracted by the oil&#x27;s scent, climb in and become covered in the slippery oil, making it impossible for them to crawl or jump out.

In both cases, the unharmed mouse can be released outdoors. However, if several mice are caught simultaneously, and especially if the trap is subsequently left unchecked for several days before release, the mice may kill and eat each other to avoid starvation. To avoid this outcome, non-lethal multi-catch traps should be checked and emptied regularly.

===Disposable mousetraps===
There are several types of one-time use, disposable mousetraps, generally made of inexpensive materials which are designed to be disposed of after catching a mouse. These mousetraps have similar trapping mechanisms as other traps, however, they generally conceal the dead mouse so it can be disposed of without being sighted. Glue traps are usually considered disposable – the trap is discarded with the mouse adhered to the trap.

==Similar devices==
Similar ranges of traps are sized for to trap other animal species; for example, rat traps are larger than mousetraps, and squirrel traps are larger still. A squirrel trap is a metal box-shaped device that is designed to catch squirrels and other similarly sized animals. The device works by drawing the animals in with bait that is placed inside. Upon touch, it forces both sides closed, thereby trapping, but not killing, the animal, which can then be released or killed at the trapper&#x27;s discretion.

== History ==
A historical reference is found in Alciatis &quot;Emblemata&quot;
from 1534. Several trap designs were described by Leonard Mascall in 1590. The conventional mousetrap with a spring-loaded snap mechanism resting on a block of wood first appeared in 1884, and to this day is still considered to be one of the most inexpensive and effective mousetraps.

==In general culture==
Reference to a mousetrap is made as early as 1602 in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (Act III, scene 2), where it is the name given to the &#x27;play-within-a-play&#x27; by Hamlet himself: &quot;&#x27;tis a knavish piece of work&quot;, he calls it. There is a reference in the 1844 novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, père. Chapter ten is titled &quot;A Mousetrap of the Seventeenth Century&quot;. In this case, rather than referring to a literal mouse trap, the author describes a police or guard tactic that involves lying in wait in the residence of someone whom they have arrested without public knowledge and then grabbing, interviewing, and probably arresting anyone who comes to the residence. In the voice of a narrator, the author confesses to having no idea how the term became attached to this tactic.

The Canterbury Tales by Chaucer also references mouse traps in the prelude section written in the late 1300&#x27;s. While introducing the Nun, Chaucer writes in lines 144-145, &quot;She wolde wepe, if that she saugh a mous/Kaught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.&quot;

There is an earlier reference to a mousetrap, found in Ancient Greek &quot;The Battle of Frogs and Mice&quot;: &quot;... by unheard-of arts they had contrived a wooden snare, a destroyer of Mice, which they call a trap.&quot;.

A mousetrap (Spanish: &quot;ratonera&quot;) figures prominently in the second chapter of the 1554 Spanish novel Lazarillo de Tormes, in which the hero Lazarillo steals cheese from a mousetrap to alleviate his hunger.

Ralph Waldo Emerson is credited (apparently incorrectly) with the oft-quoted phrase advocating innovation: &quot;Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door.&quot;

&quot;The Mousetrap&quot; is a popular play by Agatha Christie.

Mousetraps are a staple of slapstick comedy and animated cartoons. Episodes of the cartoon &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; usually have plots based on Tom attempting to trap Jerry with different (and sometimes ridiculous) methods of trapping the mouse with a device realized as a Rube Goldberg machine, often being outsmarted by the latter and injuring himself in the process with the traps.

&quot;Mouse Trap&quot; (originally titled &quot;Mouse Trap Game&quot;) is a board game first published by Ideal in 1963 for two to four players. The game was one of the first mass-produced, three-dimensional board games. Over the course of the game, players at first cooperate to build a working Rube Goldberg-like mouse trap. Once the mouse trap has been built, players turn against each other, attempting to trap opponents&#x27; mouse-shaped game pieces.

Mousetraps loaded with table tennis balls or corks have been used to demonstrate the principle of a chain reaction.

Mousetraps had become a subject of &quot;challenges&quot; on YouTube where people attempted to trigger them
quickly with their hands, fingers or even tongue without getting trapped, as well as setting up multiple mousetraps as a prank. YouTubers Gavin Free and Daniel Gruchy created an experiment using a trampoline lined up with hundreds of mousetraps, triggered all at once by jumping into the trampoline, and recorded it in slow-motion.

<text>Mayberry R.F.D. (abbreviation for Rural Free Delivery) is an American television series produced as a spin-off continuation of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. When star Andy Griffith decided to leave his series, most of the supporting characters returned for the retitled program, which ran for three seasons (78 episodes) on the CBS Television Network from 1968 to 1971.

During the eighth and final season of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, widower farmer Sam Jones (Ken Berry) and his young son Mike (Buddy Foster) are introduced and gradually become the show&#x27;s focus. Sheriff Andy Taylor takes a back seat in the storylines, establishing the new premise. Sheriff Taylor and newlywed wife Helen made guest appearances on &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; until late 1969 before they relocated with Opie. &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; was popular throughout its entire run but was canceled after its third season in CBS&#x27;s &quot;rural purge&quot; of 1971.

==Plot and characters==

Father and son stories involving Sam and Mike Jones are reminiscent of the episodes that starred Andy Griffith. Both characters are introduced in the last season of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; (&quot;TAGS&quot;), beginning with Sam&#x27;s election as head of the town council. Most of the town folk from &quot;TAGS&quot; continued their roles. Loyal Mayberry citizens Goober Pyle (George Lindsey), Clara Edwards (Hope Summers), Emmett Clark (Paul Hartman) and Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson) are seen regularly.

Sheriff Andy Taylor and his sweetheart, Helen Crump (Aneta Corsaut), marry in the new title&#x27;s first episode. Both Andy and Helen make additional appearances during the first season (mostly Andy, who remains Sheriff of Mayberry in the early appearances.) Griffith and Coursaut leave the series for good in late 1969 with a move to Charlotte, North Carolina, as the explanation. Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) becomes Sam&#x27;s housekeeper but leaves after the second season to be replaced by Sam&#x27;s cousin, Alice Cooper (Alice Ghostley).

Don Knotts as Barney Fife and Ronny Howard as Opie Taylor both appear in the first episode, with Barney serving as Andy&#x27;s best man for the wedding. Actress Arlene Golonka (who played Howard Sprague&#x27;s sweetheart Millie Hutchins/Swanson in the Griffith show) becomes Sam&#x27;s love interest in the retitled seasons.

A recurring African American character named Ralph (Charles Lampkin) lives with a teen daughter and pre-teen son next to the Jones farm. Mary Lansing appeared occasionally as Emmett&#x27;s wife, Martha. As with its predecessor, &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; continued under the sponsorship of General Foods and its products.

==Notable guest stars==
* Farrah Fawcett played a showgirl in &quot;Millie the Model&quot; (October 20, 1969).
* Jodie Foster, sister of regular cast member Buddy Foster, played a fairy in &quot;The Church Play&quot; (November 18, 1968) and a little girl in &quot;All for Charity&quot; (October 12, 1970).
* Teri Garr (credited as &quot;Terri Garr&quot;) played a cashier in &quot;Miss Farmerette&quot; (December 23, 1968).
* Will Geer played Captain Wolford in &quot;Aunt Bee&#x27;s Cruise&quot; (part one on January 13, 1969; part two on January 20, 1969).
* Natalie Schafer played Cornelia Willoughby in &quot;Goober the Housekeeper&quot; (November 9, 1970).

An NBC reunion movie, &quot;Return to Mayberry&quot;, was produced in 1986 and featured many original performers from &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. Ken Berry, Buddy Foster and Arlene Golonka did not appear, nor did &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; regulars Frances Bavier, Elinor Donahue, and Jack Burns. Nevertheless, &quot;Return&quot; does share continuity with the &quot;R.F.D.&quot; storyline, by maintaining that Andy and Helen are married. However, Andy and Helen&#x27;s son, Andy Jr., is never mentioned.

==Episodes==

==Home media==
In 1983, the distribution rights to &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; were acquired by Telepictures Corporation through its Perennial division, which was later acquired by Lorimar Productions, which was in turn acquired by Warner Bros. and merged into Warner Bros. Television Distribution.

On April 8, 2014, Warner Home Video released the first season on DVD in Region 1. It was re-released as a manufacture-on-demand (MOD) DVD via the Warner Archive Collection label on February 27, 2018.

The complete series was released on DVD on June 13, 2023.

==Reception and ratings==
The final episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; was titled &quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; and added an Italian-American family to the Sam Jones homestead. The producers chose to forgo a big overhaul and instead stuck with the winning premise of a widower, his son and the matronly Aunt Bee. Therefore, the series was much the same as &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, without Andy Taylor and son Opie.

&quot;Mayberry R.F.D.&quot; was consistently in the top ten in the Nielsen ratings the first two years of its run, but dropped to number 15 during its third and final season. That year CBS, seeking a more urban image, canceled all its rural-themed shows including &quot;Green Acres&quot;, &quot;Hee Haw&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; in what became known as the &quot;rural purge&quot;.

<doc id="543329" wikidata="Q1996635" url="?curid=543329" title="Optician">
<text>An optician is an individual who fits glasses or contact lenses by filling a refractive prescription from an optometrist or ophthalmologist. They are able to translate and adapt ophthalmic prescriptions, dispense products, and work with accessories. There are several specialties within the field.

== Types ==
===Dispensing optician or ophthalmic dispenser===

A dispensing optician is anyone who prepares, fits, and dispenses prescription lenses, spectacles, glasses, contact lenses, or any other type of vision-correcting optical device to the intended user. They may interpret optical prescriptions issued by an ophthalmologist, optometrist, or physician for the lab optician who fabricates vision-correcting optical lenses. They also measure inter-ocular or pupillary distances, vertex distances, pupil fitting heights, and frame angles to determine the proper position of vision-correcting lenses. In addition, they adapt, modify, or align frames with vision-correcting lenses to the face of the intended wearer, Dispensing opticians must have a basic knowledge of laboratory techniques such as lens surfacing and lens preparation.

===Mechanical optician, lab optician, or ophthalmic lab technician===
Ophthalmic laboratory technicians must understand optics and how to use machinery in order to surface, coat, edge, or finish lenses according to specifications provided by dispensing opticians. They typically insert lenses into frames, also called glazing, to produce finished glasses and conduct all quality and safety testing required by the respective local and country regulations. Although most lenses are designed with fully automated equipment, such as computer-based generators, automatic edgers, and lens measurement instruments, a highly-skilled lab optician will often finish lenses by hand for more difficult prescriptions and lens designs in order to have the best-finished outcome.

===Contact lens fitter or contact lens technician===
Contact lens fitters may work independently or under the direction of an ophthalmologist or optometrist to fill a doctor&#x27;s prescription for contact lenses. A patient must obtain a prescription for contact lenses from a physician and then the fitter will review contact lens handling, fitting, and follow-up care. Contact lens fitters must have computer skills, communication skills, and an understanding of medical-legal implications.

===Ocularist===
An ocularist is a trained technician who specializes in fitting a patient with a prosthetic eye after management by an ophthalmologist. Ocularists are trained in assessing the status of the orbit, fabricating and fitting a cosmetic ocular prosthesis, and periodically monitoring the prosthesis and related tissues. They ensure the correct fitting, shaping, and painting of ocular prostheses. The ocularist also educates the patient on handling and care of the prosthesis. Ocularists provide long-term care through follow-up examinations for evaluation and polishing of prostheses.

== Work environment ==
===Corporate practice=== 
Corporate practices may require more night and weekend work hours than other work environments due to the longer hours of the corporate chains. Many who work for them report the trade-off is greater room for growth, higher pay, and better benefits due to the larger scale of the employer. Purchasing of goods is conducted by the corporate headquarters and not by individuals at the locations.

===Independent practice===
Owned by the optician themselves, opticians who operate independent practices have all of the responsibilities of an entrepreneur/business owner as well as an optician. In the United States, due to certain local and state regulations, opticians cannot employ optometrists in various areas and are limited in some vision discount plans they can accept. This means they must rely more heavily on walk-in consumers than those who are owned by a doctor.

===Optometrist or ophthalmologist office===
A smaller, more intimate environment than corporate or clinical, doctor-owned practices usually do not require as many evening or weekend hours as corporate locations; however, every medical office is different and will have a unique set of features and characteristics.

===Hospitals and clinics===
Opticians working in a hospital or clinic typically oversee patient care, administer treatment and operate medical equipment under the supervision of an ophthalmologist or optometrist.

===Lab manufacturing===
This role typically does not work directly with patients and it is centred around the use of high-tech equipment and hand-held tools.

== History of opticians and spectacle makers ==
The first known artistic representation of glasses was painted by Tommaso da Modena in 1352. He did a sequence of frescoes of brothers efficiently reading or replicating manuscripts; one holds a magnifying glass while the other has glasses suspended on his nose. Once Tommaso had established the example, other painters positioned spectacles on the noses of many of subjects, almost certainly as a representation of wisdom and respect.

One of the most noteworthy developments in spectacle production in the 15th century was the introduction of concave lenses for the myopic or nearsighted. Pope Leo X, who was very myopic, wore concave spectacles when hunting and professed they enabled him to see clearer than his cohorts.

The first spectacles utilized quartz lenses since optical glass had not been developed. The lenses were set into bone, metal and leather mountings, frequently fashioned like two small magnifying glasses with handles riveted together and set in an inverted V shape that could be balanced on the bridge of the nose. The use of spectacles extended from Italy to Germany, Spain, France and Portugal.

From their inception, eyeglasses posed a dilemma that wasn&#x27;t solved for almost 350 years: how to keep them on the bridge of the nose without falling. Spanish spectacle makers of the 17th century experimented with ribbons of silk that could be attached to the frames and then looped over the ears. Spanish and Italian missionaries carried the new models to spectacle wearers in China. The Chinese attached little ceramic or metal weights to the strings instead of making loops. In 1730 a London optician named Edward Scarlett perfected the use of rigid sidepieces that rested atop the ears. This perfection rapidly spread across the continent.
In 1752 James Ayscough publicized his latest invention, spectacles with double hinged side pieces. These became very popular and appear more often than any other kind in paintings and prints of the period. Lenses were fabricated of tinted glass as well as clear. Ayscough felt that the clear glass lenses gave an unpleasant glare. In Spain in 1763 Pablo Minguet recommended turquoise, green, or yellow lenses but not amber or red.

Europeans, in particular the French, were self-conscious about the use of glasses. Parisian aristocrats used reading aids only in private. The gentry of England and France used a &quot;perspective glass” or monocular which could be concealed from view easily. In Spain, however, spectacles were popular amongst all classes since they considered glasses made them look more important and dignified.

Far-sighted or aging colonial Americans imported spectacles from Europe. Spectacles were primarily for the affluent and literate colonists, who required a valuable and precious appliance. Benjamin Franklin in the 1780s developed the bifocals. Bifocal lenses advanced little in the first half of the 19th century. The terms bifocal and trifocal were introduced in London by John Isaac Hawkins, whose trifocals were patented in 1827. In 1884 B. M. Hanna was granted patents on two forms of bifocals which become commercially standardized as the &quot;cemented&quot; and &quot;perfection&quot; bifocals. Both had the serious faults of ugly appearance, fragility, and dirt-collection at the dividing line. At the end of the 19th century the two sections of the lens were fused instead of cemented At the turn of the 20th century, there was a considerable increase in the use of bifocals.
Between 1781 and 1789, silver spectacles with sliding extension temples were being fabricated in France; however it was not until the 19th century that they gained extensive popularity. John McAllister of Philadelphia began fabricating spectacles with sliding temples containing looped ends which were much easier to use with the then-popular wigs. The loops supplement the inadequacy of stability, by allowing the addition of a cord or ribbon which could be tied behind the head, thus holding the eyeglasses firmly in place.

In 1826, William Beecher moved to Massachusetts from Connecticut to establish a jewellery-optical manufacturing shop. The first ophthalmic pieces he fabricated were silver spectacles, which were later followed by blue steel. In 1869 the American Optical Company was incorporated and acquired the holdings of William Beecher. In 1849 J. J. Bausch immigrated to the United States from Germany. He had already served an apprenticeship as an optician in his native land and had found work in Berne. His reimbursement for the labour on a complete pair of spectacles was equal to six cents. Mr. Bausch encountered difficult times in America from 1849 until 1861, at which time war broke out. When the war prevented import of glass frames, demand for his hard rubber frames skyrocketed. Continuous expansion followed and the large Bausch and Lomb Company was formed.

The monocle, which was first called an &quot;eye-ring&quot;, was initially introduced in England in the early 19th century; although it had been developed in Germany during the 18th century. A young Austrian named studied optics in London and took the monocle idea back to Germany with him. He started making monocles in Vienna about 1814 and the fashion spread and took particularly strong roots in Germany and in Russia. The first monocle wearers were upper-class gentlemen, which may account for the aura of arrogance the monocle seemed to confer on the wearer. After World War I, the monocle fell into disrepute, its downfall in the allied sphere hastened, no doubt, by its association with the German military.

The lorgnette, two lenses in a frame the user held with a lateral handle, was another 18th-century development (by Englishman George Adams). The lorgnette almost certainly developed from the scissors-glass, which was a double glass on a handle. Given that the two branches of the handle came together under the nose and looked as if they were about to cut it off, they were known as binocles-ciseaux or scissors glasses. The English altered the size and form of the scissors-glasses and produced the lorgnette. The frame and handle were often artistically embellished, given that they were used mostly by women and more often as a piece of jewellery than as a visual aid. The lorgnette maintained its popularity with ladies of fashion, who chose not to wear spectacles. The lorgnette maintained its popularity to the end of the 19th century.

Pince-nez are believed to have appeared in the 1840s, but in the latter part of the century there was a great upsurge in the popularity of the pince-nez for both men and women. Gentlemen wore any style which suited them—heavy or delicate, round, or oval, straight, or drooping—usually on a ribbon, cord, or chain about the neck or attached to the lapel. Ladies more often than not wore the oval rimless style on a fine gold chain which could be reeled automatically into a button-size eyeglass holder pinned to the dress. Whatever the disadvantage of the pince-nez, it was convenient.

In the 19th century, the responsibility of choosing the correct lens lay, as it always had, with the customer. Even when the optician was asked to choose, it was often on a rather casual basis. Spectacles were still available from travelling salesmen.

Spectacles with round lenses (like Winston Churchill), oval shape, panto shape, and tortoise shell frames became the fashion around 1930. The round spectacles and the pince-nez continued to be worn in the 30. In the 40s there was increased emphasis on style in glasses with a variety of spectacles available. Meta Rosenthal wrote in 1938 that the pince-nez was still being worn by dowagers, headwaiters, old men, and a few others. The monocle was worn by only a minority in the United States. Sunglasses, however, became very popular in the late &#x27;30s.

== Equipment ==
Opticians use a variety of equipment to fit, adjust and dispense eyewear, contact lenses, and low-vision aids.

===Manual lensometer===
Technically identified by the generic term manual lensometer, opticians may often refer to this piece of equipment as a lensometer, focimeter, or vertometer. The modern lensometer was invented in 1922 by Edgar Derry Tillyer of American Optical to determine &quot;whether lenses have the refraction and power prescribed.&quot; Proper use of the lensometer by a dispensing optician or a lab optician includes verifying back or front vertex power, orientating uncut lenses for finishing and glazing, and confirming the mounting of lenses into the frame. Manual lensometers can also be outfitted with an attachment to read the back vertex power of a contact lens for modification and verification purposes.

The optician uses the refracted, or bent light, displayed within a lensometer to interpret the sphere, cylinder, and add powers (if prescribed), axis orientation, prismatic effect, and locate the major reference point of the lens. Correct interpretation of these readings is critical to the performance of the eyewear and user satisfaction.

===Automated lensometer===
An automated lensometer uses the reflected wavelength of green light off of the lens surface along every lens meridian in order to determine all of the data points that the optician interprets with the manual lensometer. The benefits of an automated lensometer are increased speed, adjustments for variables in the index of refraction in the lens material, the ability to measure UV and light transmittance, and a decrease in training time while on the job. The drawbacks of automated lensometers in comparison to manual lensometers are greater difficulty identifying higher prismatic errors, aberrations, and surfacing power errors (optic waves), and the necessity of the optician not to tip the lens to avoid an erroneous result.

===Corneal reflex pupilometer===
A corneal reflex pupilometer is a digital device used to measure Interpupillary Distance (IPD), otherwise known as Pupillary Distance (PD). The measurement is used to align the Major Reference Point (MRP) of the lenses along the visual axis to reduce unwanted prismatic effect, eyestrain, and lens aberrations.

A PD can be taken Binocularly (from the corneal reflex of one pupil to the corneal reflex of the other) or Monocularly (from the centre of the spectacle bridge to the centre of the corneal reflex of each eye independently with the non-measured eye being occluded). By providing a rest point on the bridge similar to a glasses frame, pupilometers provided a proper reference point for obtaining an accurate monocular PD value.

PDs are also taken in relation to focus point. The eyes can be focused at infinity (distance), focused near (approximately 16 inches or 40 centimetres), or intermediate (a working distance in between near and distance. Because a pupilometer can be dialed to a specific distance and easily occluded, it is often easier to work with. This does not mean that it is more accurate than a skilled optician with a corneal reflex light, a millimeter ruler called a PD stick, and fully adjusted eyewear for certain age groups and pathologies. While a ruler alone is susceptible to parallax error, when it is used in conjunction with the other tools previously mentioned the accuracy can exceed the pupilometer for these certain patient groups 

The fitting and dispensing of contact lenses requires the use of additional equipment, all with very specific purposes. A keratometer is a diagnostic instrument for measuring the curvature of the anterior surface of the cornea, particularly for assessing the extent and axis of astigmatism. It was invented by the French ophthalmologist Samuel Hankins in 1880. Opticians, like ophthalmologists and optometrists, also use a slit-lamp/bio-microscope to examine the anterior segment, or frontal structures and posterior segment, of the human eye, which includes the eyelid, sclera, conjunctiva, iris, natural crystalline lens, and cornea. The binocular slit-lamp examination provides stereoscopic magnified view of the eye structures in detail, enabling anatomical diagnoses to be made for a variety of eye conditions.

While a patient is seated in the examination chair, he rests his chin and forehead on a support to steady the head. Using the biomicroscope, the optician then proceeds to examine the patient&#x27;s eye. A fine strip of paper, stained with fluorescein, a fluorescent dye, may be touched to the side of the eye; this stains the tear film on the surface of the eye to aid examination. The dye is naturally rinsed out of the eye by tears. Adults need no special preparation for the test; however children may need some preparation, depending on age, previous experiences, and level of trust.

The list of equipment used by an optician is extensive and is often specified in jurisdiction specific Professional Standards of Practice. The standards of the College of Opticians of British Columbia serve as an example.

== By country ==

=== Canada ===

All provinces in Canada require opticians to complete formal training and education in opticianry and then must pass competency examinations prior to receiving governmental licensure. Some provinces (Ontario and Quebec) require a single optician&#x27;s license that includes both the dispensing of glasses and contact lenses, while the other provinces have two separate licenses, one each for glasses and contact lens dispensing.

Recent changes to the British Columbia Opticians regulations allow qualified opticians in that province to test a person&#x27;s vision and prepare an assessment of the corrective lenses required for a client. Using the results of the assessment an optician is able to prepare and dispense glasses or contact lenses. Opticians in Alberta and Ontario are also permitted, under certain conditions, to refract and prepare and dispense glasses and contact lenses.

==== Provincial regulatory organizations ====

Each Canadian province has its own regulatory College or Board that provides registration or licensure to its opticians. The Regulatory body (&quot;often known as a ‘College’ but separate from, and not to be confused with, an educational institute&quot;) has a government mandate to protect the public. This includes enforcement of provincial statutes (Opticians Act) and public awareness campaigns.

====The National Association of Canadian Opticianry Regulators (NACOR)====

The National Association of Canadian Opticianry Regulators (NACOR) is an organization of all the provincial opticianry regulatory bodies in Canada (except Quebec). NACOR also administers Canada&#x27;s national opticianry examination(s). Since 2001, all jurisdictions (except Quebec) have agreed to and signed, the Mutual Recognition Agreement among Opticianry Regulators that ensures labour mobility to all opticians across the entire nation without need for further examination. All provinces (with the exception of Quebec) require individuals to achieve a passing mark in a national examination as a requirement of licensure as an optician.

Despite the non participation of Quebec in National initiatives, Canadian opticians who relocate to Quebec are able to register and practice in that province provided they meet certain language requirements.

==== Provincial associations ====

Most Canadian provinces have their own provincial opticianry associations that look after the interests of their members at the provincial level, such as advocacy. Some provincial regulatory agencies have a dual role or purpose and also serve as the association for that province. In addition to protecting their member&#x27;s interests, provincial associations also undertake public interest initiatives such as providing vision screening for children in schools, or organizing professional development seminars.

Established in 1989, the Opticians Association of Canada is a national organization of all provincial Opticianry Associations in Canada. The role of the OAC is to advocate for the various interests of opticians on a national basis.

====Education====
As a prerequisite for registration in any province of Canada opticians are required to complete a course at one of the NACOR accredited teaching institutions. Persons from an international jurisdiction may apply to a provincial regulatory agency for an assessment of equivalency of their education. Such applications are not unreasonably denied.

===Nigeria===

Dispensing Opticians are regulated by the Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians Registration Board of Nigeria (ODORBN). The training programme is a 3-year diploma programme in a Board accredited institution, located in all geopolitical zones of the nation. Some of the training institutions include Kwara State College of Health Technology (Offa), Federal Polytechnic (Nekede), and Millennium College of Health Technology.

=== United Kingdom ===
Opticians or Dispensing Opticians are regulated by the General Optical Council (GOC). A dispensing optician advises on, fits and supplies the most appropriate spectacles after taking account of each patient&#x27;s visual, lifestyle and vocational needs. Dispensing opticians also play an important role in fitting contact lenses and advising and dispensing low vision aids to those who are partially sighted and in advising on and dispensing to children where appropriate.

The Association of British Dispensing Opticians (ABDO) is the qualifying body for dispensing opticians in the United Kingdom (UK). The Fellow of British Dispensing Opticians (FBDO) is the base qualification for UK dispensing opticians. This qualification has been awarded level 6 status (equivalent to BSc) by Ofqual Welsh Assembly Government and Council for Curriculum Examinations and Assessment (CCEA). Additional qualifications, Contact Lenses and Low Vision have been assessed at level 7 (equivalent to an MSc).

=== United States ===
In the United States, an optician, through testing, may be certified by the American Board of Opticianry (ABO) to fill the prescription ordered by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Note: The ABO Exam is not nationally recognized and does not indicate a license to practice as an optician. In roughly half the states, licensing is not a requirement to make or dispense eyewear. Many eye doctors do their own dispensing, and it is frequent for eye clinics to have an optician on their premises; or, conversely, for large optical chains to have optometrists in offices on their premises.

Some opticians learn their skills through formal training programs. Professional technical schools and two-year colleges offer programs in opticianry. Two-year programs usually grant an associate degree. One-year programs offer a certificate. Training usually includes courses in optical math, optical physics, and tools and equipment use. Other opticians can apprentice to learn the required skills. Many formal education programs will accept hours worked as an apprentice to supplement or replace course credits, as well.

<doc id="543333" wikidata="Q7634851" url="?curid=543333" title="Sugar Jones">
<text>Sugar Jones was a Canadian all-female pop group created on the first season of the Canadian version of &quot;Popstars&quot; in 2001. It consisted of five members chosen from thousands of contestants who auditioned all over Canada in hopes of gaining a spot in the group. In 2001, they released their debut and only album, which was self-titled, in the summer of 2001, that featured the singles &quot;Days Like That&quot; (a cover of the Fierce song) and &quot;How Much Longer&quot;, both which were hits on Canadian radio in 2001. Sugar Jones studio album was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. After mostly local Canadian success, the group set their sights for the UK market. However, this venture saw little to no success, and Sugar Jones would ultimately disband in 2003.

==History==
Sugar Jones was formed on the television show &quot;Popstars&quot;. The show had 4,000 entrees that was narrowed down to 75. After two call-backs, it was narrowed down to 25 members. The final winners were Maiko Watson, Sahara MacDonald, Andrea Henry, Julie Crochetière, and Mirella Dell&#x27;Aquila. The members of the group moved to Toronto in October 2000 to live in an apartment together, while the shown only began airing in February 2001. The members had to hide and not be seen together to avoid spoiling the results of the program.

The group&#x27;s debut single was &quot;Days Like That&quot;, which peaked at No. 7 on Canada&#x27;s Contemporary Hit Radio chart. Their second single, &quot;How Much Longer&quot;, peaked at No. 5 on Canada&#x27;s Airplay chart. Their debut album went platinum in Canada.

In 2002, Maiko Watson left Sugar Jones to sing backup for her husband, musician Remy Shand, and the group continued as a foursome.

The group had disbanded by 2003.

==After disbanding==
After disbanding, each member pursued various interests, with Julie and Andrea both releasing solo albums in 2008. 

Julie has since married and has 2 children, as well as shifted careers to interior design and home renovation, starting a home renovation company with her husband. 

Andrea continues to work in music as an administrator in arts &amp; event services.

Sahara MacDonald released an album independently and starred in several theatre productions, including Toronto&#x27;s production of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. 
She is now a yoga instructor. 

Maiko Watson released her solo album, &quot;Sweet Vibration&quot;, in 2009, which received Best Urban Album at the 2010 Western Canadian Music Awards. In 2021, she was featured on the CBC series &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; as Mary Suddon. She married in 2018, is now known as Maiko Munroe and also in the profession of Real Estate.

Mirella became a secretary at West Island College in her hometown of Montreal and is married to Anthony De Luca, with whom she has two sons. She is still somewhat active in music, mostly live performance, and has worked in the hotel industry. She is now a secretary on the school board in Quebec.

<text>&quot;I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud&quot; (also sometimes called &quot;Daffodils&quot;) is a lyric poem by William Wordsworth. It is one of his most popular, and was inspired by an encounter on 15 April 1802 during a walk with his younger sister Dorothy, when they saw a &quot;long belt&quot; of daffodils on the shore of Ullswater in the English Lake District. Written in 1804, this 24 line lyric was first published in 1807 in &quot;Poems, in Two Volumes&quot;, and revised in 1815.

In a poll conducted in 1995 by the BBC Radio 4 &quot;Bookworm&quot; programme to determine the nation&#x27;s favourite poems, &quot;I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud&quot; came fifth. Often anthologised, it is now seen as a classic of English Romantic poetry, although &quot;Poems, in Two Volumes&quot; was poorly reviewed by Wordsworth&#x27;s contemporaries.

==Background==

The inspiration for the poem came from a walk Wordsworth took with his sister Dorothy around Glencoyne Bay, Ullswater, in the Lake District. He would draw on this to compose &quot;I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud&quot; in 1804, inspired by Dorothy&#x27;s journal entry describing the walk near a lake at Grasmere in England:

At the time he wrote the poem, Wordsworth was living with his wife, Mary Hutchinson, and sister Dorothy at Town End, in Grasmere in the Lake District. Mary contributed what Wordsworth later said were the two best lines in the poem, recalling the &quot;tranquil restoration&quot; of &quot;Tintern Abbey&quot;,

Wordsworth was aware of the appropriateness of the idea of daffodils which &quot;flash upon that inward eye&quot; because in his 1815 version he added a note commenting on the &quot;flash&quot; as an &quot;ocular spectrum&quot;. Coleridge in &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot; of 1817, while acknowledging the concept of &quot;visual spectrum&quot; as being &quot;well known&quot;, described Wordsworth&#x27;s (and Mary&#x27;s) lines, among others, as &quot;mental bombast&quot;. Fred Blick has shown that the idea of flashing flowers was derived from the &quot;Elizabeth Linnaeus phenomenon&quot;, so called because of the discovery of flashing flowers by Elizabeth Linnaeus in 1762. Wordsworth described it as &quot;rather an elementary feeling and simple impression (approaching to the nature of an ocular spectrum) upon the imaginative faculty, rather than an exertion of it...&quot; The phenomenon was reported upon in 1789 and 1794 by Erasmus Darwin, whose work Wordsworth certainly read.

The entire household thus contributed to the poem. Nevertheless, Wordsworth&#x27;s biographer Mary Moorman notes that Dorothy was excluded from the poem, even though she had seen the daffodils together with Wordsworth. The poem itself was placed in a section of &quot;Poems in Two Volumes&quot; entitled &quot;Moods of my Mind&quot; in which he grouped together his most deeply felt lyrics. Others included &quot;To a Butterfly&quot;, a childhood recollection of chasing butterflies with Dorothy, and &quot;The Sparrow&#x27;s Nest&quot;, in which he says of Dorothy &quot;She gave me eyes, she gave me ears&quot;.

The earlier &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, a collection of poems by both Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, had been first published in 1798 and had started the romantic movement in England. It had brought Wordsworth and the other Lake poets into the poetic limelight. Wordsworth had published nothing new since the 1800 edition of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, and a new publication was eagerly awaited. Wordsworth had gained some financial security by the 1805 publication of the fourth edition of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;; it was the first from which he enjoyed the profits of copyright ownership. He decided to turn away from the long poem he was working on (&quot;The Recluse&quot;) and devote more attention to publishing &quot;Poems in Two Volumes&quot;, in which &quot;I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud&quot; first appeared.

== Revision ==
Wordsworth revised the poem in 1815. He replaced &quot;dancing&quot; with &quot;golden&quot;; &quot;along&quot; with &quot;beside&quot;; and &quot;ten thousand&quot; with &quot;fluttering and&quot;. He then added a stanza between the first and second, and changed &quot;laughing&quot; to &quot;jocund&quot;. The last stanza was left untouched.

Pamela Woof wrote that &quot;The permanence of stars as compared with flowers emphasises the permanence of memory for the poet.&quot; Andrew Motion, in a piece about the enduring appeal of the poem, wrote that &quot;the final verse ... replicates in the minds of its readers the very experience it describes&quot;.

== Reception ==

=== Contemporary ===
&quot;Poems, in Two Volumes&quot; was poorly reviewed by Wordsworth&#x27;s contemporaries, including Lord Byron, whom Wordsworth came to despise. Byron said of the volume, in one of its first reviews, &quot;Mr. [Wordsworth] ceases to please, ... clothing [his ideas] in language not simple, but puerile&quot;. Wordsworth himself wrote ahead to soften the thoughts of &quot;The Critical Review&quot;, hoping his friend Francis Wrangham would push for a softer approach. He succeeded in preventing a known enemy from writing the review, but it did not help; as Wordsworth himself said, it was a case of, &quot;Out of the frying pan, into the fire&quot;. Of any positives within &quot;Poems, in Two Volumes&quot;, the perceived masculinity in &quot;The Happy Warrior&quot;, written on the death of Nelson and unlikely to be the subject of attack, was one such. Poems like &quot;I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud&quot; could not have been further from it. Wordsworth took the reviews stoically.

Even Wordsworth&#x27;s close friend Coleridge said (referring especially to the &quot;child-philosopher&quot; stanzas VII and VIII of &quot;&quot;) that the poems contained &quot;mental bombast&quot;. Two years later, many were more positive about the collection. Samuel Rogers said that he had &quot;dwelt particularly on the beautiful idea of the &#x27;Dancing Daffodils&#x27;&quot;, and this was echoed by Henry Crabb Robinson. Critics were rebutted by public opinion, and the work gained in popularity and recognition, as did Wordsworth.

&quot;Poems, in Two Volumes&quot; was savagely reviewed by Francis Jeffrey in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; (without singling out &quot;I wandered lonely as a Cloud&quot;), but the &quot;Review&quot; was well known for its dislike of the Lake Poets. As Sir Walter Scott put it at the time of the poem&#x27;s publication, &quot;Wordsworth is harshly treated in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, but Jeffrey gives ... as much praise as he usually does&quot;, and indeed Jeffrey praised the sonnets.

Upon the author&#x27;s death in 1850, &quot;The Westminster Review&quot; called &quot;I wandered lonely as a Cloud&quot; &quot;very exquisite&quot;.

=== Settings to music ===
The poem has been set to music, for example by Eric Thiman in the 20th century.
In 2007, Cumbria Tourism released a rap version of the poem, featuring MC Nuts, a Lake District red squirrel, in an attempt to capture the &quot;YouTube generation&quot; and attract tourists to the Lake District. Published on the two-hundredth anniversary of the original, it attracted wide media attention. It was welcomed by the Wordsworth Trust, but attracted the disapproval of some commentators.

In 2019 Cumbria Rural Choirs with help from the Leche Trust commissioned a setting by Tamsin Jones, which was to have been performed in March 2020 at Carlisle Cathedral with British Sinfonietta, but because of COVID restrictions in the UK the premiere was delayed until 2022.

=== Modern usage ===
The poem is presented and taught in many schools in the English-speaking world.

==== UK ====
These include the English Literature GCSE course in some examination boards in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. 
In 2004, in celebration of the 200th anniversary of the writing of the poem, it was read aloud by 150,000 British schoolchildren, aimed both at improving recognition of poetry and supporting Marie Curie Cancer Care (which uses the daffodil as a symbol, for example in the Great Daffodil Appeal).

==== Abroad ====
It is used in the current Higher School Certificate syllabus topic, &quot;Inner Journeys&quot;, New South Wales, Australia. It is also frequently used as a part of the Junior Certificate English Course in Ireland as part of the Poetry Section. The poem is also included in the syllabus for the Grade IX (SSC-1) FBISE examinations, Pakistan and the Grade X ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education) examinations, India.

V. S. Naipaul, who grew up in Trinidad when it was a British colony, mentions a &quot;campaign against Wordsworth&quot; in the island, which he did not agree with. It was argued that the poem should not be in the syllabus because &quot;daffodils are not flowers Trinidad schoolchildren know&quot;
. Jean Rhys, another writer who was born in the British West Indies, objected to daffodils through one of her characters. It has been suggested that colonisation of the Caribbean resulted in a &quot;daffodil gap&quot;. This refers to the perceived difference between the lived experience and imported English literature.

====In popular culture====

* In the 2013 musical &quot;Big Fish&quot;, composed by Andrew Lippa, some lines from the poem are used in the song &quot;Daffodils&quot;, which concludes the first act. Lippa mentioned this in a video created by Broadway.com in the same year.
* In Gucci&#x27;s Spring/Summer 2019 Collection, multiple ready-to-wear pieces featured embroidery of the last lines of the poem.
*The poem is used in a segment of the &quot;Emergency!&quot; episode &quot;Body Language,&quot; which aired on December 7, 1973. In the segment, a young lady was reciting part of the poem &quot;ad naseam&quot; after she and her boyfriend had consumed daffodil bulbs.

====Parodies====
Because it is one of the best-known poems in the English language, it has frequently been the subject of parody and satire.

The English prog rock band Genesis parodies the poem in the opening lyrics to the song &quot;The Colony of Slippermen&quot;, from their 1974 album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;.

It was the subject of a 1985 Heineken beer TV advertisement, which depicts a poet having difficulties with his opening lines, only able to come up with &quot;I walked about a bit on my own&quot; or &quot;I strolled around without anyone else&quot; until downing a Heineken and reaching the immortal &quot;I wandered lonely as a cloud&quot; (because &quot;Heineken refreshes the poets other beers can&#x27;t reach&quot;). The assertion that Wordsworth originally hit on &quot;I wandered lonely as a cow&quot; until Dorothy told him &quot;William, you can&#x27;t put that&quot; occasionally finds its way into print.

====Tourism and exhibitions in Cumbria====
Two important tourist attractions in Cumbria are Wordsworth&#x27;s homes Dove Cottage with its adjacent visitors centre and Rydal Mount. They have hosted exhibitions related to the poem. For example, in 2022 the British Library&#x27;s unique manuscript of the poem was lent to the Wordsworth Trust as part of a &quot;treasures on tour&quot; programme. It went on display in Grasmere alongside the Trust&#x27;s own copy of Dorothy Wordsworth&#x27;s Grasmere journal.

There are still daffodils to be seen in the county. The daffodils Wordsworth described would have been wild daffodils. The National Gardens Scheme runs a Daffodil Day every year, allowing visitors to view daffodils in Cumbrian gardens including Dora&#x27;s Field, which was planted by Wordsworth. In 2013, the event was held in March, when unusually cold weather meant that relatively few of the plants were in flower. April, the month that Wordsworth saw the daffodils at Ullswater, is usually a good time to view them, although the Lake District climate has changed since the poem was written.

=====200th anniversary=====
In 2015, events marking the 200th anniversary of the publication of the revised version were celebrated at Rydal Mount.

<doc id="543340" wikidata="Q1264366" url="?curid=543340" title="Winn-Dixie">
<text>Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., styled as Winn✓Dixie, is an American supermarket chain headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. It operates more than 546 stores in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. The company has had its present name since 1955 and can trace its roots back to 1925.

==Overview==
Winn-Dixie is known for its private label Chek brand soft drinks, which are produced in over 20 different flavors plus diet and caffeine-free varieties—one of the widest assortments. It has been known as &quot;The Beef People&quot; throughout its lifetime. The checkmark in the company&#x27;s logo comes from Kwik Chek, another store the company owned.

In its advertising and print media, Winn-Dixie used slogans such as “We’re Right For You” starting in 1982, “America’s Supermarket” from 1985 until 2001, “The Real Deal” from 2001 to 2004, and since 2018, “It’s a Winn Win!” Winn-Dixie has also been known for its use of the brand promises of &quot;Fresh Checked Every Day&quot; for its Jacksonville, Florida locations, &quot;Getting Better All The Time&quot; in its locations in Central Florida, &quot;El Sabor De Tu País&quot;, or &quot;The Flavor Of Your Country&quot;, in its Miami area stores, and &quot;Local Flavor Since 1956&quot; in its Louisiana area stores.

Winn-Dixie was listed in the S&amp;P 500 and had been traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &quot;WIN&quot; since February 18, 1952, prior to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005. The company was then traded under the symbol &quot;WINN&quot; on the NASDAQ before its purchase in 2012.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Winn-Dixie was built up by William Milton Davis and his sons Artemus Darius Davis, James Elsworth Davis, Milton Austin Davis and Tine Wayne Davis. William Davis started in business in Burley, Idaho, where he bought a general store in 1914 that he later renamed Davis Mercantile. As was common then, he sold most goods on credit. The advent of cash-only grocery stores in the 1920s hurt Davis&#x27;s business as the new stores offered lower prices and larger selections.

In 1925, William Davis borrowed $10,000 from his father and moved to Miami, Florida, where he purchased the Rockmoor Grocery. In 1927, the company was renamed Table Supply, and four more stores were opened. In 1931, the Davis family bought the Lively Stores chain for $10,000, to create a chain of 33 Table Supply stores across Florida from Miami to Tampa. William Milton Davis died in 1934, leaving his four sons in charge of the company.

===Takeover of Winn &amp; Lovette===
Founded in 1920 by Bill Lovette and E.L. Winn, Winn &amp; Lovette had 78 stores in 1939 when the Davis brothers bought 51 percent of the chain. In 1944, the brothers bought the remainder of the company and merged their other chains under the Winn &amp; Lovett name. The company headquarters moved to Jacksonville. 

Winn &amp; Lovett purchased the Steiden Stores chain of 31 stores in Kentucky in 1945 as well as Margaret Ann Stores, with 46 stores in Florida, in 1949. In 1952, Winn &amp; Lovett became the first industrial corporation based in Florida to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In April 1954, the company also acquired the Jitney Jungle stores around Anniston, Alabama.

Winn &amp; Lovett continued to grow by acquiring other chains, including Penney Stores in Mississippi, and Ballentine Stores and Eden Stores in South Carolina were all acquired in 1955.

===Rename to Winn-Dixie ===
In October 1955, Winn &amp; Lovett bought the 116-store Dixie-Home Stores chain based in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, then changed its name to Winn-Dixie. The company had nearly 400 stores by this point. The Winn &amp; Lovette and Margaret Ann names were dropped in Southeast Florida, and the Kwik-Chek name was adopted for more than 50 stores on the lower East Coast.

In 1956, Winn-Dixie bought Ketner-Milner Stores in North Carolina, H. G. Hill Stores in Louisiana and Mississippi, as well as King Stores in Georgia.

In 1967, Winn-Dixie bought the City Markets chain in the Bahamas, effectively extending their reach into the Caribbean. Operating 12 stores through its domestic subsidiary, W-D (Bahamas) Limited, until it sold the chain to Bahamian investors in 2006.

In 1976, Winn-Dixie purchased the Buddies Supermarket chain, based in Fort Worth, Texas, expanding the Winn-Dixie moniker into Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. By this time, it had set up division offices and distribution centers in Charlotte, Orlando and Fort Worth. 

In 1982, A. Dano Davis, son of J.E., became president and R.D. Davis, son of A.D. Davis, became vice chairman of the board. Dano then became chairman when J.E. stepped down the following year. In 1984, the company opened its first Winn-Dixie Marketplace, a 45,000-square-foot facility in Valdosta, Georgia.

Former chairman James E. Davis died at the age of 85 in March 1993. In April 1995, Winn-Dixie expanded with the purchase of the Cincinnati-based Thriftway Food Drug. In June, A.D. Davis, the last of the four Davis brothers, died at the age of 89. In October 1995, 22 stores were fined by the state of Georgia for selling expired food.

===Financial downturn and 2005 bankruptcy ===
In November 1999, Kroger announced its intention to purchase 74 Winn-Dixie locations in Texas and Oklahoma. However, the FTC blocked the sale in June 2000 and the deal was cancelled.

Winn-Dixie underwent a major restructuring, announcing in April 2000 that it was cutting 11,000 jobs and closing 114 stores. A Tampa warehouse, factories in Jacksonville, and offices in Tampa, Atlanta, and Louisville were all closed. Ten company vice presidents were also given early retirement. By this point, Winn-Dixie was falling behind in the market and losing money. It faced significant competition from Wal-Mart, with many stores overlapping, and needed to make major investments in order to modernize.

In October 2000, it acquired Jitney Jungle, which had 106 grocery stores, gas stations, and liquor stores at the time. Winn-Dixie initially planned to buy 72 of its stores for $85 million, but the FTC interceded and limited the sale to 68 stores due to concerns over competition in certain areas of Florida, Mississippi, and Alabama.

In May 2002, Winn-Dixie announced it was closing all its stores in Texas and Oklahoma, and laying off 5,300 employees, citing increased competition from Wal-Mart. At the time, the company had 71 stores in Texas, five stores in Oklahoma, and a distribution center and a dairy plant in Forth Worth.

In April 2004, Winn-Dixie announced the closure of 156 stores, and the elimination of 10,000 jobs. Included were the 21 stores that had operated under the Thriftway name in and around Cincinnati. By July, Winn-Dixie agreed to sell several Thriftway locations to Kroger, Remke Markets, and Bigg&#x27;s Supermarkets. Another 40 stores in the Atlanta area were converted to the Save Rite Grocery Warehouse brand, as an alternative to store closure. In October, the company sold 10 stores in North Carolina and Virginia to Salisbury-based Food Lion, with the stores in Clarksville, Danville, Martinsville, South Hill, Stanleytown, and Elizabethtown converting to the Food Lion name.

On February 22, 2005, Winn-Dixie filed for bankruptcy. Despite being a publicly traded company, the Davis family still held about 35 percent of Winn-Dixie stock. Starting in June, the company adjusted its store hours and stopped 24/7 service. On June 21, it announced the sale or closure of 326 stores and the elimination of 22,000 store positions and 500 corporate employees. In July, seven stores were sold in the Piedmont Triad. 

As part of the restructuring, the company pulled out of the Carolinas, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. It also exited the Atlanta market. Once the restructuring was completed, Winn-Dixie&#x27;s footprint was reduced to the Bahamas, and five of the Deep South states—almost all of Florida and Alabama, the southeastern half of Louisiana, the southeast corner of Mississippi, and the southwest and coastal corners of Georgia. With the closures, Winn-Dixie now had fewer stores than it had in the 1950s.

On February 28, 2006, it was announced that 35 more stores were to be sold or closed within the coming months, with the Central and South Florida areas being the most affected. On March 31, 2006, it was announced that the chain would sell its 12 Bahamian locations, which had been operated by a wholly owned subsidiary, W-D Limited, under the names City Market and Winn-Dixie.

===BI-LO acquisition===

On June 29, 2006, Winn-Dixie announced that it had filed a plan of reorganization with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida. The company emerged from Chapter 11 protection on November 21, 2006, in a much stronger financial position. In July 2010, Winn-Dixie closed 30 underperforming stores and cut 120 roles.

Winn-Dixie discontinued its use of the name SaveRite in 2011. December 19, 2011, Winn-Dixie agreed to be sold to BI-LO for $530 million. As part of the deal, Winn-Dixie became a subsidiary of BI-LO but its stores would continue to operate under the Winn-Dixie name.

The merger was completed in March 2012, making Winn-Dixie a subsidiary of Bi-Lo Holdings, ending 67 years of Davis family ownership. The combined company operates 750 stores in seven southeastern states, employing approximately 63,000 team members. The merged company moved its headquarters from BI-LO&#x27;s base in Mauldin, South Carolina to Winn-Dixie&#x27;s former headquarters in Jacksonville.

On October 8, 2013, all remaining Sweetbay Supermarket locations were rebranded as Winn-Dixie following its purchase by Bi-Lo. In May 2015, Bi-Lo Holdings changed its name to Southeastern Grocers.

In May 2017, Southeastern Grocers announced the closing of eight Winn-Dixie stores as part of a corporate-wide closure of 23 locations along with the elimination of some department lead roles at stores. In July 2017, it was announced that Southeastern Grocers would debut the Harveys brand in the Central and West Florida markets with the conversion of seven Winn-Dixie stores. In October 2017, Southeastern announced that three more West Florida Winn-Dixie stores would be converted to the Harveys brand, and an additional five South Florida stores would become Fresco y Más locations in November 2017.

===2018 bankruptcy===
In February 2018, it was announced that Southeastern Grocers was selling eight Winn-Dixie locations in south Louisiana to Texas-based, Brookshire Grocery Company as well as an additional three Mississippi and four New Orleans market locations to Baton Rouge-based, Shoppers Value Foods.

On March 15, 2018, Southeastern Grocers announced they would file a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 by the end of March. According to the company, the restructuring would decrease overall debt levels by over $500 million. Under this plan, 35 Winn-Dixie stores would close, along with an additional 59 stores across the BI-LO, Harveys, and Fresco y Más brands.

On March 22, 2018, it was announced that the Orange Beach, Alabama Winn-Dixie location was being sold to Rouses Markets. On March 28, Southeastern agreed to sell three Winn-Dixie stores in northeast Alabama to wholesaler Mitchell Grocery Corp on behalf of two of its current customers, Johnson&#x27;s Giant Foods and The D&#x27;Alessandro Organization LLC, while the Winn-Dixie location in Atmore, Alabama, was being acquired by Ramey&#x27;s. An additional three BI-LO locations in South Carolina along with three Harveys locations in Georgia would be sold to three independent Piggly Wiggly store owners. The deals are in conjunction with the restructuring support agreement revealed by Southeastern Grocers. 

On March 31, 2018, it was announced that the Andalusia, Alabama Winn-Dixie location&#x27;s lease and equipment would be purchased by a Piggly Wiggly franchisee. On May 1, an independent Piggly Wiggly operator announced that they would re-open the Montgomery, Alabama Winn-Dixie location that closed as part of the original restructuring plan. The store was subsequently closed in 2020. 

In May 2018, Southeastern Grocers&#x27; restructuring plan was confirmed by a U.S. Bankruptcy judge in Delaware. At the end of that month, Southeastern Grocers announced that it had completed its financial restructuring and was emerging from bankruptcy. As part of the restructuring, $522 million in debt was exchanged for equity in Southeastern Grocers, though it was not announced who was receiving the equity shares. Southeastern Grocers exited bankruptcy with 575 stores in seven states, down from 704 locations. They also announced a planned remodels of 100 stores in 2018.

In February 2019, Southeastern Grocers announced plans to close 22 locations in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. This round of closures included seven Winn-Dixie locations. 

In 2020 Southeast Grocers began the Romay Davis Belonging, Inclusion and Diversity Grant with the goal of funding minority-supporting organizations.

===Sale to Aldi===
On August 16, 2023, Southeastern Grocers entered into an agreement to sell 400 Winn-Dixie and Harvey&#x27;s Supermarkets stores to German supermarket chain Aldi Süd. Stores will either remain open under the Winn Dixie or Harvey&#x27;s brand or convert to the ALDI Süd format. The 28 Fresco y Mas stores and four stand-alone pharmacies were not part of the agreement with Aldi and will be operated by Fresco Retail Group, LLC. 

In March 2024, it was reported that Aldi completed the purchase of Winn-Dixie&#x27;s parent company. On February 7, 2025, Aldi sold the company with the inclusion of 170 Winn-Dixie stores of the approximately 400 stores and 170 of its liquor stores to a private consortium of investors that include C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers. Aldi’s will run its 220 acquired stores from the sale through its licensing with the company until the last location is converted to its format by 2027.

==Other Davis involvements==

The Davis brothers also became involved in Florida politics, supporting conservative causes. It is reported that their financial support helped George Smathers beat incumbent U.S. Senator Claude Pepper in 1950. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Donald Regan is reported to have said of his financial guru, James E. Davis: &quot;When J.E. calls, I listen.&quot; It is reported that after reading Booker T. Washington&#x27;s &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;, James E. Davis began a program of Winn-Dixie supporting historically black colleges and universities.

The Davis brothers endowed the Stetson University School of Business Administration with a building, Davis Hall, which was dedicated in 1967. On the dedication plaque inside the building, below the names of the donors, was the inscription, &quot;Learn management that you may produce or distribute goods and services to improve the living for the people and produce a good return on invested capital for investors.&quot; 

In 1982, J.E. Davis spearheaded a $6 million corporate fund-raising drive and donated 140 acres of property to the Mayo Clinic in order to build a new facility in Jacksonville. The location opened in October 1986, and is still funded by the Davis family. The Davis family gave an additional 210 acres to the clinic in October 2022.

In 1984, the Davis family also donated $3 million to Jacksonville University. In 1998, another $10 million was given to finance the construction of the Davis College of Business &amp; Technology building on its Arlington campus.

In the 1990s, Winn-Dixie gave a generous contribution to the Boy Scouts of America of the Central Florida Council, resulting in the renaming of Camp La-No-Che to Winn-Dixie Scout Reservation. Naming rights expired in 2007 and the name has since been changed.

The Davis family has also partnered with the PARC Group to develop the Nocatee planned community in Florida. The first residents arrived in 2006. Another community, called eTown, was announced in March 2019.

Winn-Dixie has long been involved in Jacksonville, including a former sponsorship as the official supermarket of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL).

==Locations==
As of November 28, 2022, Winn-Dixie operates more than 546 grocery stores in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, and Mississippi.

==Brands==

In 1956, Winn-Dixie introduced its first private label brand, Deep South. Since then, it has run over 60 brands, including Crackin&#x27; Good, Astor and Fisher, Superbrand, Thrifty Maid, Chek, and W-D Brand. 

In 2003 the company cut the number down to a three-tier system of brands: the &quot;Prestige&quot; brand for upscale private label products, &quot;Winn-Dixie&quot; for its mainstream items, and &quot;Thrifty Maid&quot; for its value items. In 2007, all three brands received redesigned packaging with plans to replace the &quot;Prestige&quot; brand with &quot;Winn &amp; Lovett&quot;. In 2010, Winn-Dixie replaced its value-centered brand Thrifty Maid with Valu Time. Valu Time was replaced with Clear Value in 2012. 

Beginning in 2016, SE Grocers began to transition to a unified private label brand under the &quot;SE Grocers&quot; brand, including SE Grocers Essentials for budget buys, SE Grocers for mid-market items, and GE Grocers Prestige for higher-end offerings. In July 2023, SE Grocers announced a new clean label called Know &amp; Love. Other brands used by the company include TopCare, Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, Whiskers &amp; Tails, Chek, Tippy Toes, Hickory Sweet, and WD Brand.

<doc id="543344" wikidata="Q15525022" url="?curid=543344" title="Tony Lockett">
<text>Anthony Howard Lockett (born 9 March 1966) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the St Kilda Football Club and Sydney Swans in the Australian Football League (AFL). Nicknamed &quot;Plugger&quot;, he played as a full-forward and holds the VFL/AFL record for career goals, scoring 1,360 goals in total.

Inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2006 and upgraded to Legend status in 2015, he is the most prolific goalkicker in VFL/AFL history, breaking Gordon Coventry&#x27;s 62-year record in 1999 with his 1300th goal and eventually finishing with 1,360 goals from 281 games. He became the first full-forward to be awarded the Brownlow Medal (achieved in 1987), won the Coleman Medal four times, and kicked more than 100 goals in a season on six occasions (an AFL record he shares with Jason Dunstall of Hawthorn).

While Lockett&#x27;s accomplishments and statistics support his status as an Australian football hero, his individual influence on St. Kilda and Sydney is also noteworthy. He arrived at St Kilda when the club was in the doldrums and became the man on whose shoulders the club&#x27;s fortunes depended. Similarly, when he moved to Sydney in 1995, the Swans were struggling both on and off the field; they had finished bottom of the ladder in 1994 and were battling to stay relevant in the heart of rugby league territory. After kicking more than 100 goals three times in four seasons and famously booting a point to send Sydney into the 1996 AFL Grand Final, Lockett helped to ensure Australian rules football would have a lasting future in the Harbour City.

Lockett&#x27;s achievements are all the more remarkable given the significant chunks of time he missed through injury and suspension. Besides suffering from chronic asthma, he struggled to maintain his weight (which fluctuated from 95 to 112 kg over the years, according to listings in AFL Records) and required painkillers to manage the ongoing effects of a torn groin muscle. Lockett was not afraid to use his size and strength to unsettle opponents, but his aggression also resulted in him being frequently reported for striking and rough conduct. He appeared before the AFL Tribunal 16 times over his career and was suspended for a total of 23 matches.

==Early life==
Born in the western Victorian town of Ballarat to Howard Lockett, a local football champion who would later be inducted in the North Ballarat Football Club Hall of Fame, and Liz, Lockett is one of three siblings, with a brother (Neil) and a sister (Di). Lockett&#x27;s passion for greyhound racing can be traced to his grandfather Charlie, who supplied pacemakers for the local greyhound racing club and was a club committeeman at North Ballarat.

Lockett was educated at Ballarat Secondary College and Ballarat Grammar School, and began playing Australian football with the Under-12s team of his father&#x27;s club, North Ballarat Football Club, in 1974. He played a total of 120 junior games with the club. He had played just five senior games as a 16-year-old in 1982 with North Ballarat before he was recruited by St Kilda, since Ballarat was part of the club&#x27;s recruiting zone.

==VFL/AFL career==

===St Kilda: 1983–1994===
==== 1983–1986 ====
When Lockett arrived at St Kilda in 1983, the club was going through a period of decline on and off the field; in his first four seasons at Moorabbin, the Saints would finish at the bottom of the ladder. As a teenager coming out of Ballarat for the first time, Lockett was constantly homesick in his early years and eventually St Kilda conceded to his desire to travel from home when required.&lt;br&gt; 
Lockett made his senior VFL debut in Round 4 against at VFL Park. There was a high degree of controversy surrounding this game since the Saints, after seeking legal advice, decided to include &#x27;s Paul Morwood in their line-up without a clearance from the Swans or a permit from the League. According to the rules at the time, if the Saints had won, they would have risked forfeiting the premiership points. As it turned out, they went down in a spirited effort by 11 points. Lockett joined a special group of VFL/AFL players when he goaled with his first kick, but had an otherwise quiet debut with only five disposals and four marks.&lt;br&gt; 
Lockett was supposed to be understudy to the enigmatic Mark Jackson, whom the Saints had brought in from on a three-year contract. But after Jackson was sacked mid-season, Lockett was given the role and finished the season with a modest return of 19 goals in 12 games.

In the opening game of 1984, the Saints were up against the previous season&#x27;s runner-up at Moorabbin. starting up at full forward, Lockett matched his Essendon counterpart Paul Salmon goal for goal in an entertaining game which the Bombers won by 37 points after a tight first half. Both Lockett and Salmon would end up with seven goals. Lockett showed a glimpse of his explosive best in the third quarter when he kicked three goals in a four-minute spell, and beat a succession of opponents to be considered the Saints&#x27; best player.

Lockett was now recognised as one of the VFL&#x27;s star forwards, and teams were trying to find players who could physically match him. In St Kilda&#x27;s opening game of the 1986 VFL season against at Western Oval, Lockett was reported by four umpires for striking Bulldogs captain Rick Kennedy during the third quarter. Lockett pleaded guilty to the charge, claiming he had been provoked, and was suspended for two matches.

==== 1987–1990 ====
St Kilda&#x27;s fortunes were finally about to turn when premiership captain Darrel Baldock was appointed coach for 1987 while still serving in the Parliament of Tasmania. He appointed Danny Frawley captain, having identified leadership qualities in the then 23-year-old full back, gave regular game time to newcomers Nathan Burke and Nicky Winmar, who would become club stalwarts for the following decade, and set about improving the general skill level of the playing group. Under Baldock&#x27;s guidance, Lockett had a career-best season, tying for the Brownlow Medal with John Platten.

==== 1991–1992 ====
In the first half of the pre-season match against in February 1991, Lockett was sprinting to contest for a loose ball when West Coast&#x27;s Steve Malaxos, who was also running for the ball, collided with Lockett and made contact with his lower back, resulting in a cracked vertebra. Lockett limped off the ground gingerly and was sent to hospital for x-rays at half time. He was initially diagnosed as having suffered a &quot;badly bruised back&quot;. According to champion Hawthorn full-forward Peter Hudson, who was St Kilda&#x27;s club manager at the time, it was expected that Lockett would return for the following pre-season game. However, the misdiagnosed injury would sideline Lockett for the first six rounds of the 1991 AFL season.&lt;br&gt;
In Round 7 the Saints played League newcomers at Moorabbin. At the time St Kilda was ninth on the ladder, having played five matches for two wins and one draw. Boosted by the return of Lockett and Nicky Winmar (who was back after serving a 10-match suspension from the previous season), the signs were ominous early when, from the opening bounce, star midfielder Robert Harvey collected the ball out of the centre and found Lockett with a well-weighted pass. Lockett converted from the set shot, and thereafter, with a full-capacity crowd of over 25,000 spectators cheering them on, St Kilda went on a scoring rampage. Lockett added a further three goals for the quarter, and had nine to his name by half time. The Saints increased their lead at each change, eventually winning by 131 points and breaking the previous club record for greatest winning margin. Lockett finished the game with 12 goals, and the percentage-boosting win lifted St Kilda to fifth on the ladder.&lt;br&gt;
Lockett backed up his spectacular return with ten goals the following week against (he had seven goals by half time) and another haul of 12 goals against (in which he kicked St Kilda&#x27;s first five goals) to take his overall tally to a remarkable 34 goals in three games. In the Round 10 match against , however, before the biggest home crowd at Moorabbin since 1981, St Kilda suffered stage fright, conceding a 44-point lead at quarter time and eventually losing by 28 points. Essendon coach Kevin Sheedy sacrificed an extra player in defence to cut off the supply to Lockett (who only managed four goals), while the Bombers&#x27; team pressure and discipline also contributed significantly to the win.&lt;br&gt; 
St Kilda rebounded strongly in Round 11, putting in a superb second-half display to beat at Princes Park for the first time at that venue since 1976. Lockett kicked seven goals for the game to again be among the Saints&#x27; best players, but was afterwards cited by video for two incidents – clashing heavily with Hawks ruckman Stephen Lawrence in the first quarter and later with Greg Madigan. However, no further action was taken and Lockett was cleared to play.&lt;br&gt;
In Round 23 St Kilda confirmed its place in the 1991 AFL finals series with a 120-point thrashing of Brisbane at Moorabbin, marking the club&#x27;s first finals appearance since 1973. Lockett sat out the game, having been ill with influenza and warned by the club&#x27;s medical staff that playing could trigger an asthma attack.&lt;br&gt;
In the Elimination final against Geelong, he kicked nine goals and five behinds, although the Saints were beaten by seven points.

In 1992, he kicked the most goals that season, with 132 goals. He was described by dual Brownlow medallist Robert Harvey as the best player he had ever seen.

==== 1993–1994 ====
After the highs of personal glory and reaching the finals in 1991 and 1992, there followed two difficult seasons, which would turn out to be Lockett&#x27;s last ones at the Saints, marred by long absences due to injury and suspension.

After kicking five goals in the loss to Hawthorn in the opening round of the 1994 AFL season, Lockett started well against North Melbourne in the Round 2 clash at the MCG, kicking three quick goals, only to suffer a corked right calf muscle shortly afterward. With Lockett unable to return after quarter time, and Stewart Loewe already absent with a groin injury, the Saints lacked a key target in attack and the Kangaroos won easily by 69 points. Lockett would end up missing the next four weeks, during which the Saints won only one game.

Few games better encapsulated Lockett&#x27;s enigmatic nature than his return in the Round 7 match against at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In the first quarter, Swans defender Peter Caven was sprinting back to take an intercept mark when Lockett, who was charging towards the ball, appeared to hit him in the face with a raised elbow. Caven was knocked unconscious with a compound fracture of the nose and immediately taken to St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital for surgery, ruling him out of action for 12 weeks. Lockett was subjected to abuse by Sydney supporters for the remainder of the game, but it appeared to have little effect on him. The Swans responded on the scoreboard, at one stage leading by 51 points in the third quarter; only Lockett&#x27;s seven goals up to three-quarter time had kept an inept-looking St Kilda in the contest. The Saints still trailed by 41 points halfway through the final term before they finally clicked, kicking seven unanswered goals (Lockett kicking the last three in the final three minutes) to snatch a one-point win. After kicking his eleventh goal to put the Saints in front, Lockett responded to the taunts of the Sydney cheer squad with an &quot;up yours&quot; gesture.&lt;br&gt;
Lockett was not reported by any umpires for his hit on Caven, but subsequent review of the video footage by AFL officials on the Tuesday following the game resulted in Lockett being charged not just for the incident with Caven, but also for kneeing Daryn Cresswell in the head. In his appearance before the Tribunal, Lockett pleaded not guilty, stating that he was sorry for injuring Caven and had not done so intentionally. He added that he had only seen Caven a split second before impact, raising his elbow in self-defence. Nonetheless, Lockett was found guilty of striking and suspended for eight weeks.

Lockett would not play again until Round 17 against North Melbourne at Waverley Park, a 61-point loss in which he was held to two goals by Mick Martyn, one of the few full-backs capable of matching Lockett. By this stage of the season, the Saints were out of finals contention, sitting second-last on the ladder with the worst percentage in the League. Lockett did not take long to rediscover form, kicking 28 goals in a four-game stretch before being ruled out of the final game of the season against with a back injury. He ended the season with 56 goals, which was a slight improvement from his return the previous season.

===Sydney: 1995–1999, 2002===
In 1995, Lockett transferred to the Sydney Swans, where he played for another six seasons. He was an instant success with the Swans, helping the team into the 1996 finals series and subsequently into the 1996 AFL Grand Final. 
With scores tied in the preliminary final game, Lockett famously kicked a point after the siren against Essendon to give Sydney a one-point victory. Despite a groin injury, he played in the grand final, which the Swans lost to North Melbourne. It was the only grand final appearance of Lockett&#x27;s career.

Lockett&#x27;s career-best goal-scoring performance came in Round 19, 1995, against Fitzroy at the Western Oval, when he scored 16 goals straight.

Lockett became a cult figure in Sydney. He was a massive drawcard for the struggling Sydney Swans, who had previously found it difficult to attract large support in New South Wales&#x27;s rugby league heartland. At the height of his popularity, the song &quot;One Tony Lockett&quot; was released (sung to the tune of &quot;Guantanamera&quot;), performed by James Freud.

In 1996, Lockett was the subject of much hype in the clash between Geelong and Sydney in which Gary Ablett Sr. was playing at the other end of the ground. The match was billed by the media as &quot;Plugger&quot; vs &quot;God&quot; and set a ground record attendance at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He broke the record of 1,299 career goals (set by Gordon Coventry) at the SCG in 1999 and sparked one of the biggest pitch invasions seen in Australian rules football.

Lockett retired at the end of 1999 but had a brief comeback in 2002, playing three games and adding three goals to his record for a grand total of 1,360 career goals.

===State of Origin===
Lockett played five State of Origin games for Victoria, kicking 19 goals in those games. In his State of Origin debut in 1985 against Western Australia, Lockett kicked one goal. He was selected in 1987 against South Australia, and again kicked one goal. In 1989, he kicked five goals in a notable game against South Australia at the MCG. He again kicked five goals against Western Australia in 1992. His final interstate match came in 1995 against South Australia, kicking seven goals and winning the E. J. Whitten Medal. Lockett is known as a big supporter of State of Origin and said after he won the E. J. Whitten Medal that &quot;to win this medal will probably go down as one of the happiest days of my life, and I&#x27;ll treasure it forever&quot;.

==Life outside football==
During his time at St Kilda, Lockett resented the attention that came with his superstar status in Victorian football, and was well known for his distrust of the media. In one particularly famous incident in 1988, he was at the Mercy Private Hospital with his father to receive treatment for the serious ankle injury he had sustained against , but had not been informed by St Kilda club officials that a media contingent, which included Eddie McGuire as a reporter for Network Ten, would also be in attendance. Caught by surprise, Lockett angrily hurled both his crutches at the cameraman.

After retiring, Lockett purchased a rural property near Bowral in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales and moved there with his wife Vicki and four daughters. 
In a 2014 interview, he dismissed the idea that he had become a recluse since retiring, stating that he was simply enjoying the quiet life of an ex-footballer.

The move to Sydney, and the relative anonymity that came with it, appeared to soften Lockett. He even appeared in various television commercials, including Advanced Hair and Lowes Menswear (in Sydney). While at a taping session for a Lowes commercial, Lockett engaged in a friendly wrestling match with former amateur rugby player Adrian &quot;Ace&quot; Mueller, who was at the time working for Lowes corporate division. According to some reports, the friendly wrestle developed into something quite competitive, with Lockett pinning Mueller (an exponent of the Israeli self-defence system Krav Maga).
Lockett appeared with Stephen Curry and Dave Lawson in a Toyota Memorable Moments advertisement that takes a lighthearted look at some memorable moments in his career such as the piglet &quot;Pluga&quot;, &quot;One Tony Lockett&quot;, &quot;That Point&quot; and his 1,300th goal (including the pitch invasion).
Lockett is also well known for his interest in greyhound racing.

Lockett has competed in the gruelling Finke Desert Race in the open motorcycle class since 2008, and for the over-45s subcategory on many occasions between 2011 and 2019, riding in 2017, 2018, and 2019 by using his KTM 500 EXC.

In 2017, Lockett made a surprise decision to return to the Sydney Swans as a part-time goalkicking and forwards coach.

==Nickname==
Lockett&#x27;s father, Howard, inherited the nickname &quot;Plugger&quot; from his own father, who used to &quot;plug around&quot; in the garden. Howard Lockett, who himself played 500 games of country football, then saw it fit to pass down the nickname once more to his son, and it serendiptiously became synonymous with his large size.

In Round 18, 1993, in a match at the Sydney Cricket Ground between St Kilda (then Lockett&#x27;s club) and Sydney (his future club), a piglet (being a reference to Lockett&#x27;s portly build) was released by a member of the Sydney crowd onto the ground (with the wrongly spelled nickname &quot;Pluga&quot; and Lockett&#x27;s playing number of &quot;4&quot; spray-painted onto it) before being tackled to the ground and removed by Sydney Swans player Darren Holmes. The Channel Seven commentary of the incident had the famous exclamation of &quot;There&#x27;s a pig at full-forward!&quot; from commentator Sandy Roberts. Lockett was actually absent from the match due to injury, which may have stimulated the idea for the prank in the first place as a joke replacement. A man named Mark claimed to be behind the prank and came forward on SEN1116 in 2017, 24 years after the fact.

==Legacy==
Lockett was inducted to both the St Kilda and Sydney Swans&#x27; Team of the Century in 2001 and 2003, respectively.

In 2004, he was inducted into the North Ballarat Football Club hall of fame.

On 22 June 2006, Lockett was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. In 2015, he was elevated to &quot;Legend&quot; status.

The southern goal end at Docklands Stadium was named after him as the &quot;Lockett End&quot;, with the other end being named after the footballer whose goal record he broke, Gordon Coventry.

The Ballarat Football League award for the leading goal-scorer for the home-and-away season is named after Lockett, as he played his junior football with Ballarat Football League club North Ballarat.

On 19 July 2009, Lockett was inducted into the Sydney Swans Hall of Fame.

In 2003, he was inducted into the St Kilda Football Club Hall of Fame; on 24 July 2010, he was elevated to &quot;Legend&quot; status.

Lockett kicked over one hundred goals in a season on six occasions: at St Kilda in years 1987 (117), 1991 (127), and 1992 (132); and at Sydney in years 1995 (110), 1996 (121), and 1998 (109). This is a tied league record for the number of times a player has kicked over 100 goals in a separate season (which he shares with Jason Dunstall).

The New South Wales Primary Schools Sports Association Australian Football competition is named the Tony Lockett Shield.

In 2017, Lockett was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

In March 2021, before the Round 2 match between and at Marvel Stadium set aside to honour the memory of former Saints captain and Fox Footy personality Danny Frawley and promote mental health awareness, Lockett made a surprise appearance, along with Garry Lyon and Stewart Loewe, to pay tribute to his late friend and captain.

<doc id="543345" wikidata="Q135292" url="?curid=543345" title="Pseudomonas fluorescens">
<text>Pseudomonas fluorescens is a common Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium. It belongs to the &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; genus; 16S rRNA analysis as well as phylogenomic analysis has placed &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; in the &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; group within the genus, to which it lends its name.

==General characteristics==
&quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; has multiple flagella, an extremely versatile metabolism, and can be found in the soil and in water. It is an obligate aerobe, but certain strains are capable of using nitrate instead of oxygen as a final electron acceptor during cellular respiration.

Optimal temperatures for growth of &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; are 25–30°C. It tests positive for the oxidase test, and is also a nonsaccharolytic bacterial species.

Heat-stable lipases and proteases are produced by &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; and other similar pseudomonads. These enzymes cause milk to spoil, by causing bitterness, casein breakdown, and ropiness due to production of slime and coagulation of proteins.

===The name===
The word &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; means false unit, being derived from the Greek words &quot;pseudēs&quot; (Greek: ψευδής – false) and &quot;monas&quot; (Latin: &quot;monas&quot;, from Greek: μονάς – a single unit). The word was used early in the history of microbiology to refer to germs. The specific name &quot;fluorescens&quot; refers to the microbe&#x27;s secretion of a soluble fluorescent pigment called pyoverdin, which is a type of siderophore.

===Genomics===
Notable &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; strains SBW25, Pf-5 and PfO-1 have been sequenced, among others.

A comparative genomic study (in 2020) analyzed 494 complete genomes from the entire &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; genus, with 25 of them being annotated as &quot;P. fluorescens&quot;. The phylogenomic analysis clearly showed that the 25 strains annotated as &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; did not form a monophyletic group. In addition, their Average Nucleotide Identities did not fulfil the criteria of a species, since they were very diverse. It was concluded that &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; is not a species in the strict sense, but should be considered as a wider evolutionary group, or a species complex, that includes within it other species too. This finding is in accordance with previous analyses of 107 &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species, using four core &#x27;housekeeping&#x27; genes, that consider &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; as a relaxed species complex.

The &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; relaxed evolutionary group that was defined by Nikolaidis et al. on the basis of the genus phylogenomic tree, comprised 96 genomes and displayed high levels of phylogenetic heterogeneity. It comprised many species, such as &quot;Pseudomonas corrugata, Pseudomonas brassicacearum, Pseudomonas frederiksbergensis, Pseudomonas mandelii, Pseudomonas kribbensis, Pseudomonas koreensis, Pseudomonas mucidolens, Pseudomonas veronii, Pseudomonas antarctica, Pseudomonas azotoformans, Pseudomonas trivialis, Pseudomonas lurida, Pseudomonas azotoformans, Pseudomonas poae, Pseudomonas libanensis, Pseudomonas synxantha&quot;, and &quot;Pseudomonas orientalis&quot;. The core proteome of the &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; group comprised 1396 proteins. The protein count and GC content of the strains of the &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; group ranged between 4152 and 6678 (average: 5603) and between 58.7–62% (average: 60.3%), respectively. Another comparative genomic analysis of 71 &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; genomes identified eight major subgroups and developed a set of nine genes as markers for classification within this lineage.

===Interactions with &quot;Dictyostelium&quot;===
The slime mold &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; contains &quot;farmer&quot; individuals that live in association with &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot;. Two strains of the bacterium are associated with the farmer. One strain serves as a food source and the other strain serves as a symbioant that produces beneficial secondary metabolites. The main genetic difference between these two strains is a mutation of the global activator gene called &quot;gacA&quot;. This gene plays a key role in gene regulation; when this gene is knocked out in the nonfood bacterial strain, it loses its special secondary metabolites and, independently, is transformed into a food strain.

==Biocontrol properties==
Some &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; strains (CHA0 or Pf-5, for example) present biocontrol properties, protecting the roots of some plant species against parasitic fungi such as &quot;Fusarium&quot; or the oomycete &quot;Pythium&quot;, as well as some phytophagous nematodes.

It is not clear exactly how the plant growth-promoting properties of &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; are achieved; theories include: 
* The bacteria might induce systemic resistance in the host plant, so it can better resist attack by a true pathogen.
* The bacteria might outcompete other (pathogenic) soil microbes, e.g., by siderophores, giving a competitive advantage at scavenging for iron.
* The bacteria might produce compounds antagonistic to other soil microbes, such as phenazine-type antibiotics or hydrogen cyanide.

To be specific, certain &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; isolates produce the secondary metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG), the compound found to be responsible for antiphytopathogenic and biocontrol properties in these strains. The &quot;phl&quot; gene cluster encodes factors for 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis, regulation, export, and degradation. Eight genes, &quot;phlHGFACBDE&quot;, are annotated in this cluster and conserved organizationally in 2,4-DAPG-producing strains of &quot;P. fluorescens&quot;. Of these genes, &quot;phlD&quot; encodes a type III polyketide synthase, representing the key biosynthetic factor for 2,4-DAPG production. &quot;PhlD&quot; shows similarity to plant chalcone synthases and has been theorized to originate from horizontal gene transfer. Phylogenetic and genomic analysis, though, has revealed that the entire &quot;phl&quot; gene cluster is ancestral to &quot;P. fluorescens&quot;, many strains have lost the capacity, and it exists on different genomic regions among strains.

Some experimental evidence supports all of these theories, in certain conditions; a good review of the topic is written by Haas and Defago.

Several strains of &quot;P. fluorescens&quot;, such as Pf-5 and JL3985, have developed a natural resistance to ampicillin and streptomycin. These antibiotics are regularly used in biological research as a selective pressure tool to promote plasmid expression.

The strain referred to as Pf-CL145A has proved itself a promising solution for the control of invasive zebra mussels and quagga mussels (&quot;Dreissena&quot;). This bacterial strain is an environmental isolate capable of killing &gt;90% of these mussels by intoxication (i.e., not infection), as a result of natural product(s) associated with their cell walls, and with dead Pf-145A cells killing the mussels equally as well as live cells. Following ingestion of the bacterial cells mussel death occurs following lysis and necrosis of the digestive gland and sloughing of stomach epithelium. Research to date indicates very high specificity to zebra and quagga mussels, with low risk of nontarget impact. Pf-CL145A has now been commercialized under the product name Zequanox, with dead bacterial cells as its active ingredient.

Recent results showed the production of the phytohormone cytokinin by &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; strain G20-18 to be critical for its biocontrol activity by activating plant resistance.

==Medical implications==
By culturing &quot;P. fluorescens&quot;, mupirocin (an antibiotic) can be produced, which has been found to be useful in treating skin, ear, and eye disorders.
Mupirocin free acid and its salts and esters are agents currently used in creams, ointments, and sprays as a treatment of methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; infection.

&quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; demonstrates hemolytic activity, and as a result, has been known to infect blood transfusions.

&quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; produces the antibiotic obafluorin.

Recent case studies have reported instances of pneumonia caused by &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot;. These studies are significant as they identify &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; from lung biopsy specimens, providing insights into its pathogenic potential and informing treatment strategies based on antibiotic susceptibility testing.

Ongoing research into the antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of the &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; complex is exploring both intrinsic and acquired resistance to antimicrobial agents in strains isolated from various environments. This research is crucial for understanding the evolution of antimicrobial resistance and the role of &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; as a potential reservoir of clinically important resistance genes.

&quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; is being studied for its biotechnological applications, particularly in the production of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (MCL-PHAs). These biodegradable polymers have potential uses in medical devices and drug delivery systems.

&quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; is an unusual cause of disease in humans, and usually affects patients with compromised immune systems (e.g., patients on cancer treatment). From 2004 to 2006, an outbreak of &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; in the United States involved 80 patients in six states. The source of the infection was contaminated heparinized saline flushes being used with cancer patients.

&quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; is also a known cause of fin rot in fish.

== Bioremediation properties ==
&quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; is increasingly recognized for its bioremediation potential, particularly in the degradation of environmental pollutants such as hydrocarbons. A study has shown that biostimulation and bioaugmentation with &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; can significantly contribute to the removal of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) from contaminated soil. This process is facilitated by the bacterium’s production of biosurfactants, which increase the bioavailability of hydrocarbons for degradation.

Further research has explored the biofilm-forming and denitrification capabilities of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species, including &quot;P. fluorescens&quot;, in eutrophic waters. The ability to form biofilms and produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) enhances the bioremediation potential of these bacteria. Specifically, strains that exhibit strong biofilm-forming and EPS production capabilities show higher nitrate removing capacity, which is crucial for combating water pollution. These findings underscore the importance of &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; in environmental cleanup efforts and its potential application in treating oil-contaminated and nutrient-poor soils as well as nitrate-polluted water.

== Agricultural Research ==
&quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; is increasingly recognized for its biocontrol properties in agriculture. Recent studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in controlling a variety of plant pathogens, including fungi, nematodes, and bacteria. The bacterium’s ability to produce secondary metabolites, such as antibiotics and phytohormones, contributes to its biocontrol efficacy. These metabolites not only inhibit the growth of pathogens but also induce systemic resistance in plants, enhancing their natural defense mechanisms.

Moreover, the application of &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; as a biocontrol agent has been shown to be a sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides, promoting environmental health and reducing the ecological footprint of agricultural practices. The ongoing research in this field is focused on optimizing the use of &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; for biocontrol and understanding the underlying mechanisms that enable it to protect crops from diseases.

==Metabolism==
&quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; produces phenazine, phenazine carboxylic acid, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol and the MRSA-active antibiotic mupirocin.

===Biodegradation capacities===
4-Hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase is an enzyme found in &quot;P. fluorescens&quot; that transforms piceol, NADPH, H+, and O2 into 4-hydroxyphenyl acetate, NADP+, and H2O.

<text>In ancient Roman religion, Concordia (means &quot;concord&quot; or &quot;harmony&quot; in Latin) is the goddess who embodies agreement in marriage and society. Her Greek equivalent is usually regarded as Harmonia, with musical harmony a metaphor for an ideal of social concord or &quot;&quot; in the political discourse of the Republican era. She was thus often associated with Pax (&quot;Peace&quot;) in representing a stable society. As such, she is more closely related to the Greek concept of &quot;homonoia&quot; (), which was also represented by a goddess.

Concordia [[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]] was cultivated in the context of Imperial cult. Dedicatory inscriptions to her, on behalf of emperors and members of the imperial family, were common.

==In art and numismatics==
In Roman art, Concordia was depicted sitting, wearing a long cloak and holding onto a patera (sacrificial bowl), a cornucopia (symbol of prosperity), or a caduceus (symbol of peace). She was often shown in between two other figures, such as standing between two members of the Imperial family shaking hands. She was associated with a pair of female deities, such as Pax and Salus, or Securitas and Fortuna. She was also paired with Hercules and Mercury, representing &quot;Security and Luck&quot; respectively.
Several imperial coins depicted the goddess Concordia, such as those issued by Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. The representation of Concordia on a Roman coin of the gens Aemilia (denarius of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus) inspired Laura Cretara for the obverse of Italy&#x27;s commemorative 1000 lire of 1970, &quot;Roma Capitale&quot;.

==Temples==
The oldest Temple of Concord, built in 367 BC by Marcus Furius Camillus, stood on the Roman Forum. Other temples and shrines in Rome dedicated to Concordia were largely geographically related to the main temple, and included (in date order):
* a bronze shrine (aedicula) of Concord erected by the aedile Gnaeus Flavius in 304 BC &quot;in Graecostasis&quot; and &quot;in area Volcani&quot; (placing it on the Graecostasis, close to the main temple of Concord). He vowed it in the hope of reconciling the nobility who had been outraged by his publication of the calendar, but the senate would vote no money for its construction and this thus had to be financed out of the fines of condemned usurers. It must have been destroyed when the main temple was enlarged by Opimius in 121 BC.
*one built on the arx (probably on the east side, overlooked the main temple of Concord below). It was probably vowed by the praetor Lucius Manlius in 218 BC after quelling a mutiny among his troops in Cisalpine Gaul, with building work commencing in 217 and dedication occurring on 5 February 216.
*a temple to Concordia Nova, marking the end Julius Caesar had brought to civil war. It was voted by the senate in 44 BC. but was possibly never built.
*a shrine or temple dedicated by Livia according to Ovid&#x27;s Fasti VI.637‑638 (&quot;te quoque magnifica, Concordia, dedicat aede Livia quam caro praestitit ipsa viro&quot; - the only literary reference to this temple). Ovid&#x27;s description of the Porticus Liviae in the same poem suggests that the shrine was close to or within the porticus. It is possibly to be identified with the small rectangular structure marked on the Marble Plan (frg. 10), but scholarly opinion has been divided on this.

In Pompeii, the high priestess Eumachia dedicated a building to Concordia Augusta.

==Modern religion==
Harmonians and some Discordians equate Concordia with Aneris. Her opposite is thus Discordia, or the Greek Eris.

==Namesakes==
The asteroid 58 Concordia is named after her.

There is a temple named after her in Agrigento, Sicily. It&#x27;s located in the Valley of the Temples.

<text>Chips and Technologies, Inc. (C&amp;T), was an early fabless semiconductor company founded in Milpitas, California, in December 1984 by Gordon A. Campbell and Dado Banatao.

Its first product, announced September 1985, was a four chip EGA chipset that handled the functions of 19 of IBM&#x27;s proprietary chips on the Enhanced Graphics Adapter. By that November&#x27;s COMDEX, more than a half dozen companies had introduced EGA-compatible boards based on C&amp;T&#x27;s chipset. This was followed by chipsets for PC motherboards and other computer graphics chips.

C&amp;T was acquired by Intel in 1997, primarily for its graphics chip business.

Former members of C&amp;T founded Asiliant Technologies in January 2000 to continue the support of the CHIPS 65545, 65550, 65555, 69000, 69030, and other notebook and LCD oriented graphics ICs. Intel licensed the rights to build, sell, and service the C&amp;T chips to Asiliant. Asiliant manufactured and sold C&amp;T components for the next few years until it closed.

==x86 products==
C&amp;T SuperMath J38700DX was an 80387DX compatible FPU coprocessor.

C&amp;T also designed a 386-compatible microprocessor known as the Super386 38600DX/38600SX using clean room design techniques, but this chip never enjoyed as much success as the 386 CPUs produced by Intel, AMD, and Cyrix. C&amp;T 38605DX had 512 byte cache, but the 144 pin PGA package was incompatible with 386 socket.

== Motherboard chips and chipsets ==

* 82C100 - IBM PS/2 Model 30 and Super XT Computer Chip - Released in 1987, compatible with 8086, 80C86, V30, 8088, 80C88, V20 CPUs. Compatible with all PC/XT functional units: 8284, 8288, 8237, 8259, 8254, 8255, DRAM controller, SRAM controller, Keyboard controller, Parity Generation and Configuration registers. Additionally features EMS control, dual clock and power management. It supports up to 2.5 MB RAM.
* 82C206 chip, introduced by C&amp;T in 1986 and the core of the NEAT (New Enhanced AT) chipset. This chip, like its predecessor the 82C100, provided equivalent functionality to the TTL chips on the PC/AT&#x27;s mainboard, namely: the 82284 clock generator, the 82288 bus controller, the 8254 Programmable Interval Timer, the two 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controllers, the two 8237 DMA controllers, the MC146818 NVRAM/RTC chip.
* 82C235 - Single Chip AT (SCAT) - Released in 1989, compatible with PC/AT. Supported LIM EMS 4.0, up to 16 MB memory and Shadow RAM.
* 82C351, 82C355, 82C356 / CS82310 (PEAK DM) - A three chip successor to NEAT for 32-bit 386DX CPUs. The PEAK DM/386 chipset supports up to 128MB of RAM in eight banks (32MB in two banks most commonly implemented), and up to 256KB of direct-mapped L2 cache.
* 82C836 - Single Chip 386sx AT (SCATsx) - Compatible with PC/AT (bus), supported all the features of SCAT, added support for the i386SX processor and i387SX math coprocessor, and optional external L2 cache.

==Video chips==
Chips and Technologies was the first company (outside of IBM) to deliver an EGA-compatible chipset. The Enhanced Graphics CHIPSet consisted of the four chips:
* 82C431 Graphics Controller
* 82C432 Sequencer
* 82C433 Attributes Controller
* 82C434 CRT Controller

Later C&amp;T announced a &quot;Super EGA&quot; dual-chip chipset: 82C435 Enhanced Graphics Controller and 82A436 Bus Interface with resolution up to 800×600 38MHz.

C&amp;T was the first company (outside of IBM) to deliver a compatible VGA chipset, the 82C451, and VGA cards were introduced the same year as VGA (1987) based on the 82C451, opening up the IBM compatible graphics display market. This market was then entered by companies such as Trident Microsystems, Western Digital, Cirrus Logic, Oak Technology, and others, until it was saturated.

The 82C480/82C481 series is fully compatible with the IBM 8514/A graphics controller and accelerates 2D GUI operations on a 32-bit VRAM interface. 

Chips and Technologies provided the Wingine video card, a very high speed framebuffer that sat in a proprietary local bus slot on supported motherboards. Epson and JCIS were two manufacturers who offered motherboards featuring the Wingine local bus slot. The Wingine was popular with users of NEXTSTEP for Intel processors, as it was one of the highest performing video cards supported by the operating system. Latest HiQVision architecture (65550, 65554, 65555, 68554, 69000 and 69030) was aimed at low-cost, high performance, highly integrated products with flatpanel/LCD direct drive features.

Apple used a number of C&amp;T controllers in their PowerBook line. Among others, the 65550 was used in the PowerBook 3400 and the faster 65554 was used in the &quot;Kanga&quot; PowerBook G3, which was derived from the 3400. Early NuBus PowerBooks such as the PowerBook 1400 used the less-sophisticated 65525A.

C&amp;T eventually ended up competing in the low end of the video market, the 65555 featured an LVDS transmitter and notably won a design in early Compaq Armada laptops.

<text>The Lucy Show is an American sitcom that aired on CBS from 1962 to 1968. It was Lucille Ball&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. A significant change in cast and premise for the fourth season (1965–1966) divides the program into two distinct eras; aside from Ball, only Gale Gordon, who joined the program for its second season, remained. For the first three seasons, Vivian Vance was the co-star.

The earliest scripts were titled &quot;The Lucille Ball Show&quot;; but, when that title was rejected by CBS, producers thought of calling the show &quot;This Is Lucy&quot; or &quot;The New Adventures of Lucy&quot;, before deciding on the title &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Ball won consecutive Emmy Awards as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for the series&#x27; final two seasons, 1966–67 and 1967–68.

==Creation==

In 1960, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz divorced, and the final episode of &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot; aired (using the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; format). Later that year, Ball moved to New York to try the Broadway stage in an unsuccessful musical, &quot;Wildcat&quot;. During the show&#x27;s run, Ball was plagued by illness and fatigue and in early 1961, the show closed when she collapsed on stage from total exhaustion. Later that year, she married for the second time, to comedian Gary Morton. Ball returned to television in the spring of 1962, when she teamed with Henry Fonda in a CBS special titled &quot;The Good Years&quot;. However, she was adamant about not returning to weekly television, feeling she could never top the success of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

At that time, Desilu Productions was struggling. In the spring of 1961, four of the studio&#x27;s situation comedies were cancelled: &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot;; &quot;Angel&quot;, a sitcom starring Marshall Thompson and French actress Annie Farge; &quot;Harrigan and Son&quot;, starring Pat O&#x27;Brien and Roger Perry; and &quot;Guestward, Ho!&quot;, starring Joanne Dru and Mark Miller. After a two-year run, the comedy series &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot; (which was a spin-off of the popular Desilu sitcom &quot;December Bride&quot;), was canceled in the spring of 1962. It starred Harry Morgan and Cara Williams in the title roles. At that time, the red-headed Williams, who had been promoted as the next Lucille Ball, had just received an Emmy nomination as Best Actress in a Comedy Series for her role on the show. That left Desilu with only one hit series, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;.

Arnaz, as president of Desilu, offered Ball an opportunity to return to television in a weekly sitcom. At that time, CBS executives were somewhat dubious as to whether Ball could carry a show without Arnaz, and whether she could follow such a landmark series as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. It was &quot;never intended for this program to go beyond a single season.&quot; This arrangement was &quot;meant to be a stop-gap measure for the beleaguered studio&quot; and that through the sale of this series, Desilu was able to &quot;force the CBS network to invest in and air other upcoming Desilu products.&quot; It was a strategy that Ball would use in the future to take control of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;&#x27;s renewal from CBS. With Arnaz&#x27;s encouragement and persuasion, Ball agreed to do the show, provided that it would be shown on Monday nights (the night on which &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; had aired), and that she would be reunited with Vivian Vance and her writers from &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. CBS agreed to a full season of episodes without a pilot, and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; premiered on Monday, October 1, 1962, at 8:30 p.m.

== Premise ==
The original premise of the series was that widow Lucy Carmichael lives in the fictional town of Danfield, New York with her teenage daughter Chris and younger son Jerry, with her divorced friend Vivian &quot;Viv&quot; Bagley and Bagley&#x27;s young son Sherman as tenants. Early episodes included their next-door neighbor, Harry Connors. Lucy&#x27;s late husband left her a substantial trust fund, managed by a local banker (originally recurring character Mr. Barnsdahl, and later regular character Mr. Mooney); Lucy would frequently try to persuade the bank to let her raid the fund for various purchases or harebrained projects. Lucy also took on various jobs to boost her finances. Lucy, Viv, and Chris all dated regularly, yielding additional fodder for plots; in early episodes, Viv had a regular boyfriend, Eddie Collins.

In 1965, the show was extensively retooled for its fourth season. Lucy moves to Los Angeles to be closer to Chris, who was attending college in California (but no longer appeared on the show), and enrolls Jerry in a military boarding school there (facilitating his also being written out). Viv, now remarried as Vivian Bunson, remains in Danfield with Sherman, but visits Lucy a few times; Lucy&#x27;s new best friend is Mary Jane Lewis. Lucy finds that Mr. Mooney has been transferred to the Los Angeles branch of the bank, and she eventually becomes his employee there. The new setting provided ample opportunity for celebrities to appear as themselves, often becoming entangled in Lucy&#x27;s zany schemes. References to Lucy&#x27;s children and her trust fund were eventually dropped, and this remained the show&#x27;s premise through the sixth and final season.

==Production==

&quot;The Lucy Show&quot; was one of only two sitcoms at the time to use the multi-camera setup and film with a live studio audience (&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, which was also filmed by Desilu and aired on CBS, was the other).

The show began with Lucille Ball as Lucy Carmichael, a widow with two children, Chris (Candy Moore) and Jerry (Jimmy Garrett), living in the fictional town of Danfield, New York, sharing her home with divorced friend Vivian Bagley (Vance) and her son, Sherman (Ralph Hart). In order to get Vance to commit to the series, Arnaz acquiesced to her demands for an increase in salary, co-star billing, a more attractive wardrobe and, finally, that her character&#x27;s name be Vivian. After doing &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, she was still being referred to as Ethel Mertz by people on the street, much to her annoyance.

Although the book on which the show was based, Irene Kampen&#x27;s &quot;Life Without George&quot;, centered on two divorcées living together in the same house raising their children, it was decided early on that the Lucy Carmichael character should instead be a widow. The consensus was that fans would be offended by a Lucy who was divorced, despite the fact that this was a new character and Ball herself was divorced. The character of Vivian Bagley became the first divorced woman on primetime television.

In the show&#x27;s original format, Lucy had been left with a substantial trust fund by her late husband, which was managed during the first season by local banker Mr. Barnsdahl (Charles Lane). Comedian Dick Martin, working solo from his longtime partner Dan Rowan, was cast in ten episodes as Lucy&#x27;s next-door neighbor and frequent boyfriend, Harry Connors, during the show&#x27;s first season. Character actor Don Briggs was also featured in six episodes as Viv&#x27;s beau, Eddie Collins, and Tom Lowell, a young actor seen on various primetime television shows, appeared in three installments as Chris Carmichael&#x27;s boyfriend, Alan Harper. The first season of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; fully utilized the talents of Bob Carroll Jr., Madelyn Martin, Bob Schiller, and Bob Weiskopf (four of the five original writers of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;) in creating its thirty episodes, with Desi Arnaz as executive producer for fifteen of those shows. At the end of its first season, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; received rave reviews from the critics and ranked #5 in the Nielsen ratings. Ball was nominated for an Emmy Award as Best Actress in a Series, but lost to Shirley Booth for the NBC comedy hit &quot;Hazel&quot;. Bolstered by great ratings, the series was renewed for a second year, but many changes were made.

At the beginning of the 1962–63 season, Desi Arnaz resigned as head of Desilu and as the executive producer of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Ball took over as president of the studio and Elliott Lewis replaced Arnaz as executive producer of Ball&#x27;s series. Dick Martin, Don Briggs, Tom Lowell, and Charles Lane left the show. The characters of Harry Connors and Alan Harper were never mentioned again. Briggs would make one more appearance as Eddie Collins in the episode &quot;Lucy Goes Duck Hunting&quot;. The Barnsdahl character was replaced by Theodore J. Mooney, played by Gale Gordon, who would remain with the series for the remainder of its run, surviving another format change. In the episode &quot;Lucy Gets Locked in the Vault&quot;, Gordon&#x27;s character is introduced when Lucy discovers that Mr. Barnsdahl has been transferred to another bank and that the management of her trust fund has been taken over by a new banker. The name &quot;Theodore Mooney&quot; had been used earlier by the actor George Cisar, who was cast as a police sergeant on thirty-one episodes of Gordon&#x27;s other CBS sitcom, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;.

Gordon had worked with Ball as far back as 1938 on the CBS radio program &quot;The Wonder Show&quot; and later worked with her on another radio show, &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;. When CBS retooled &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot; for television as &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, Gordon was offered the role of Fred Mertz, but he was already committed to the radio series &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; (which also was about to move to television) so William Frawley was cast in the part. In 1952, Gordon guest starred on the first season of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as Ricky Ricardo&#x27;s boss at the Tropicana, Alvin Littlefield. Six years later, Gordon became a regular on the short-lived NBC-TV sitcom &quot;Sally&quot; which starred actress Joan Caulfield (who inherited Lucille Ball&#x27;s role as Liz Cooper when &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot; was directly adapted to television in 1953). In the late fall of 1958, Gordon guest-starred as a judge in the hour-long &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot; episode &quot;Lucy Makes Room for Danny&quot;. From 1960 to 1962, he had recurring roles on two CBS-TV sitcoms – &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; and &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;. Gordon was to have joined &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; at its premiere in the fall of 1962, but he was still contractually obligated to &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, in which he had replaced Joseph Kearns, who had unexpectedly died earlier in the year. It was later revealed that Ball had grown unhappy with Charles Lane because of his difficulty remembering his lines in front of the studio audience and was eager to have Gordon join the cast. Lane then became a semi-regular on the CBS-TV sitcom &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; as Homer Bedloe.

During the first two seasons, a few guest stars were brought in for some episodes such as Broadway superstar Ethel Merman, actor-comedian Wally Cox, singer Roberta Sherwood, and golf pros Jimmy Demaret and Bo Wininger. Character actor-comedian Hans Conried, who was a semi-regular on &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; playing Uncle Tonoose, appeared on two episodes of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; in 1963 (&quot;Lucy&#x27;s Barbershop Quartet&quot; and &quot;Lucy Plays Cleopatra&quot;) playing Dr. Gitterman, a voice teacher. At this time, Ball also used many other well-known character actors in featured parts such as Carole Cook, Mary Wickes, Roscoe Karns, John McGiver, William Schallert, John Carradine, Robert Alda, Majel Barrett, Karen Norris, Dorothy Konrad, Lou Krugman, Stafford Repp, Ellen Corby, Philip Carey, Carl Benton Reid, Lyle Talbot, Leon Ames, Jackie Coogan, Kathleen Freeman, Keith Andes (who was Ball&#x27;s leading man in the Broadway musical Wildcat), William Windom, Vito Scotti. Robert Rockwell, Frank Aletter, Reta Shaw, Murvyn Vye, Hazel Pierce, J. Pat O&#x27;Malley, Roland Winters, Sandra Gould, Cesare Danova, Bobs Watson, Nancy Kulp, future Academy Award-winning actor Jack Albertson, and even the &quot;Queen of the Hollywood Extras&quot; Bess Flowers. In addition, young performers like Don Grady, Tina Cole, Barry Livingston, Eddie Applegate, Stephen Talbot, Lee Aaker, Eddie Hodges, future Academy Award-nominee Michael J. Pollard, and even Ball&#x27;s two children Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr., also made appearances on the program. In the second season, Ball&#x27;s second husband Gary Morton made his acting debut on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;.

At the end of the second season, a disagreement erupted between Ball and head writers Bob Carroll, Jr., and Madelyn Martin regarding a particular script which Ball found to be inferior. As a result, Carroll, Martin, Weiskopf and Schiller left the series.

In early 1964, the show was in threat of getting canceled when Lucille Ball attempted to retire from CBS to spend her time as president of Desilu Productions, but she changed her mind and signed a new three-year agreement with the network.
In the fall of 1964, though CBS began to broadcast sporting events and cartoons in color, they still refused to broadcast &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; in color even though the series had been filmed in color since the start of the second season, 1963-1964. Through that year ownership of color TV sets grew, and several other manufacturers began making color equipment and color TV sets.

At the beginning of the 1964–65 season, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; went through a significant staff change. Elliott Lewis left the series as executive producer and was replaced by Jack Donohue, who served as producer and director. With the absence of Carroll, Martin, Weiskopf, and Schiller, Ball hired veteran comedy writer Milt Josefsberg, who had written for Jack Benny, as script consultant. Under Josefsberg&#x27;s supervision there were no permanent writers for the series and different writers were employed each week (among them, Garry Marshall). Ball persuaded Weiskopf and Schiller to return and write four installments.

There were further changes to the series. Vivian Vance reduced the number of episodes in which she appeared in that season to spend more time on the East Coast with her husband, literary editor John Dodds. Ann Sothern, whom Ball considered to be &quot;the best comedian in the business, bar none&quot; and a personal friend, made a number of appearances during 1964 and 1965 as the &quot;Countess Framboise&quot; (née Rosie Harrigan) to fill Vance&#x27;s absence. The Countess, who had been widowed by the death of her husband, &quot;who left her his noble title and all of his noble debts,&quot; was always trying to get money to pay off her debts. She also did battle with Mr. Mooney, whom she called &quot;Mr. Money&quot;. Because it was known that Vance would be leaving the series, Sothern was proposed as the new co-star, but she declined. Sothern allegedly wanted to share top billing with Ball, a term that Ball was unwilling to accept. Sothern made three more guest appearances during the following (1965–66) season.

In the spring of 1965, Vance was growing tired of commuting weekly between her home on the East Coast and Los Angeles. To continue appearing on the show, Vance wanted more creative control with the opportunity to produce and direct episodes and to receive better pay. Agents and studio executives misinformed Ball regarding Vance&#x27;s desires, believing that she wanted to be Ball&#x27;s equal. It was decided not to meet Vance&#x27;s requests, leaving both Ball and Vance feeling betrayed by the other. As a result, Vance decided to leave the series. Ball would later regret not giving Vance what she requested. Without Vance on the show, Ball seriously considered ending the series, feeling she couldn&#x27;t continue without her.

Even though Candy Moore, Jimmy Garrett, and Ralph Hart were still contracted to the series, they were used minimally during the third year. For example, in the episode &quot;Lucy and the Old Mansion&quot;, which was the final Season 3 installment, filmed in January 1965, Moore, Garrett, and Hart appear in the opening scene, have a few lines of dialogue, then exit. It is the last time in which all of the three children are seen, and they were subsequently written out in Season 4. Dropping Candy Moore, in fact, was Ball&#x27;s decision. Because Moore was popular with teenagers and the subject of dozens of articles in youth-oriented magazines at the time, her departure was originally nixed by CBS but finally accepted when Ball threatened to &quot;retire.&quot; 
The third season included such guest stars as Jack Benny, Bob Hope, Danny Kaye, and Arthur Godfrey.

==Format, setting, and major cast changes==

In the first episode of the fourth season, Lucy and Jerry Carmichael and Mr. Mooney moved from Danfield to California, where Lucy began working for Mr. Mooney at the bank. Lucy&#x27;s daughter Chris was said to have gone away to college and was not mentioned again. It was explained that Vance&#x27;s character (Vivian Bagley) remarried and that she, along with her son Sherman and her new husband, remained in Danfield, although she returned for a few guest appearances towards the end of the series&#x27; run. With Candy Moore and Ralph Hart having already left the show at this point, only Jimmy Garrett was retained, but he would make only two appearances to support the transition before he, too, was phased out of the series.

This procedure was later explained by Oscar Katz, one of Desilu&#x27;s vice presidents. According to Katz, &quot;If you go into a network with the same series but a radically changed format, the contracts allow for greater financial renegotiation.&quot; Candy Moore adds, &quot;By dropping all of us at once, Desilu was able to get a lot more money out of CBS for the continuation of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;.&quot;

In the fourth season premiere episode, &quot;Lucy at Marineland&quot;, Jerry was quickly shipped off to a military academy. He made one final appearance, in a Christmas-themed episode, midway in the 1965–66 season. Sothern made three more guest appearances as the Countess, and Joan Blondell guest-starred in two episodes as Lucy&#x27;s new friend Joan Brenner. However, Ball felt there was no chemistry between them and so, the idea of Blondell becoming Lucy&#x27;s new comrade on the series was quickly rejected.

Finally, Lucy gained a new best friend, Mary Jane Lewis (Mary Jane Croft). Croft had prior experience performing with Ball and was the wife of former executive producer Elliott Lewis. In 1954, she made her first appearance on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; playing Cynthia Harcourt, a rich friend of Lucy Ricardo in the episode &quot;Lucy Is Envious&quot;. In 1956, she returned to the series playing Evelyn Bigsby, a traveler seated next to Lucy on an airplane in the fifth season finale, &quot;Return Home from Europe&quot;. In 1957, she made her final appearances on the series as Lucy&#x27;s neighbor Betty Ramsey in the sixth season. During the 1950s, Croft also had occasional roles on &quot;I Married Joan&quot; and &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;. She was also the voice of Cleo the basset hound in the sitcom &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot;. Croft then portrayed Lucy Carmichael&#x27;s friend Audrey Simmons during the 1962–64 episodes of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. In the third season, with the departure of Elliott Lewis as executive producer, Croft had also left the series, although her character of Audrey was still referred to in a few episodes but never seen. At this time, Croft had also been a regular for ten years on the long-running ABC-TV sitcom &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, which was in its final year of production in 1965. In returning to &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; in the fall of 1965 as a new character, Croft was replacing Vivian Vance as Lucy&#x27;s pal and co-conspirator; she did not, however, get co-star billing – like Roy Roberts, who played Mooney&#x27;s boss at the bank, Mr. Cheever, she received featured billing despite playing a regular character.

By January 1966, all references to Lucy Carmichael&#x27;s children, her trust fund, and her former life in Danfield were dropped. Lucy Carmichael was firmly established as a single woman living in Los Angeles. Lucy worked in films disguised as stunt man &quot;&#x27;Iron Man&#x27; Carmichael&quot; for three episodes (&quot;Lucy the Stunt Man&quot;, &quot;Lucy and the Return of Iron Man&quot;, and &quot;Lucy and Bob Crane&quot;). At the end of the 1965–66 season Lucille Ball was nominated for her second Emmy for &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; as Best Actress in a Comedy Series, however, Mary Tyler Moore took home the trophy for her role as Laura Petrie for &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

The next two seasons featured many stars making guest appearances as themselves conducting business at Lucy&#x27;s bank. For the last two seasons, Vivian Vance made three guest appearances in her role as Vivian Bagley (except it was now Vivian Bunson, as her character had gotten married again when Lucy Carmichael moved to California). In all three episodes in which Viv visited Lucy, there were passing references to their former life in Danfield as well as Viv&#x27;s new husband, but no mention was made about any of their children. In the fifth-year episode &quot;Lucy Gets Caught Up in the Draft&quot;, Lucy Carmichael receives a letter from her son, who is away in military school. In that installment, he is called Jimmy, not Jerry. During the filming of that particular show, Ball was constantly being corrected by her crew saying that the son&#x27;s name was Jerry and that Jimmy Garrett had played that part and that was the reason for her being confused. However, Ball refused to listen and so the error stayed in and that was the last reference to Lucy Carmichael&#x27;s son. For the 1966–67 season, Gale Gordon was nominated for an Emmy Award as Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, but lost to Don Knotts, who won for his guest appearance in the episode &quot;The Return of Barney Fife&quot; on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;. Maury Thompson received a nomination for Best Directing in a Comedy Series and is the only Lucy director ever to receive a nomination in the directing category. After eleven years, Ball was finally awarded an Emmy as &quot;Best Actress in a Comedy Series&quot; (she had previously won two, as &quot;Best Comedienne&quot; in 1953 and as &quot;Best Actress in a Continuing Performance&quot; in 1956 for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;).

During the 1967–68 season, Ball&#x27;s second husband, Gary Morton, became executive producer of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Lucille Ball sold Desilu Productions to Gulf+Western Industries, abandoning ownership of the series. In the spring of 1968, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; won Emmy nominations for Best Comedy Series, Milt Josefsberg and Ray Singer for Best Writing in a Comedy Series, Lucille Ball for Best Actress in a Comedy Series, and Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (Gale Gordon). This time, Gordon lost the award to Werner Klemperer of &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, and the show itself lost the Best Comedy Series Award to the NBC sitcom &quot;Get Smart&quot;. For the second straight year, Ball was awarded the coveted statuette. At the end of its sixth season, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; posted its highest Nielsen rating, ranking at #2.

After six seasons, Ball decided to end the series, feeling that the show had enough episodes for syndication. Ball opted to continue on television under the provision that her two children, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr., agreed to appear alongside her. Thus, in the fall of 1968, an entirely new series, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, debuted. This series featured her and her children, as well as Gordon. Croft was gradually added as a regular and Vance made several guest appearances. Gordon, as well as both actresses, played new characters which were similar to their characters on the former series. Like &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; also ran on CBS for six seasons.

==Cast==

==Guest stars==

From the 1965–66 season onward, with the change in format, a number of celebrities guest starred on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, usually playing themselves under the premise that the Lucy Carmichael character, now living in Hollywood, crossed paths with them, either in her day-to-day life, or through her job at the bank. These included Jack Benny, Mickey Rooney, Carol Burnett, George Burns, Joan Crawford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Dean Martin, Phil Silvers, Frankie Avalon, Wayne Newton, Robert Stack, Mel Tormé, John Vivyan, Jack Cassidy, Clint Walker, and Milton Berle.

Other CBS shows were sometimes brought in. In the episode &quot;Lucy and John Wayne&quot;, a photograph of Bob Crane as Colonel Hogan from &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; can be seen as guest star Wayne is exiting a scene.

The episode featuring Joan Crawford, &quot;Lucy and the Lost Star&quot;, caused much celebrity fodder given Ball and Crawford&#x27;s public feud during the filming. According to Ball, Crawford was often drunk on the set and could not remember her lines. Ball was said to have requested several times to replace Crawford with Gloria Swanson, who was supposed to have filled the role originally but bowed out for health reasons. Crawford was so upset that at one point, she wouldn&#x27;t leave her dressing room. According to Ball&#x27;s friend the singer-comedian Kaye Ballard, it was Vanda Barra, a featured actress frequently used on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, who finally persuaded Crawford to continue with the show by giving her a much needed pep talk. As a result, Crawford sailed through the filming with nary a flaw. After the show was filmed, Crawford went out of her way to thank Barra for encouraging and supporting her.

The February 14, 1966 episode featuring Dean Martin (in which Lucy Carmichael accepts a blind date with Dean Martin&#x27;s lookalike stunt double &quot;Eddie Feldman,&quot; but when he can&#x27;t make it, the &quot;real&quot; Dean Martin takes his place on the date with Lucy) was described by Ball as her favorite episode of the series.

Lucie Arnaz, Ball&#x27;s daughter, appeared in several episodes of the show during its run: she was an extra in the first season&#x27;s third episode, &quot;Lucy Is a Referee,&quot; the teenage best friend of Chris in &quot;Lucy Is a Soda Jerk&quot; and &quot;Lucy Is a Chaperone&quot; (though she was only 12 at the time), and later as one of her mother&#x27;s friends, Dottie, in the 1967 &quot;Lucy and Robert Goulet&quot; (although she was only 16). She was also seen briefly as a teen walking past Lucy and Mr. Mooney in the episode &quot;Lucy and the Ring a Ding Ring&quot;. She was also seen playing a student named Patty in the episode &quot;Lucy Gets Her Diploma&quot;.

In addition, Desi Arnaz, Jr. appeared in six episodes on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; as Mary Jane Croft&#x27;s son Billy Simmons (&quot;Lucy Is A Referee&quot;, &quot;Lucy Visits the White House&quot;, &quot;Lucy and the Little League&quot;, and &quot;Lucy and the Scout Trip&quot;). Lucie Arnaz appeared with her brother Desi Arnaz Jr. (Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz&#x27;s son) briefly in the first episode of the fourth season, &quot;Lucy at Marineland&quot;.

The October 1965 episode, &quot;Lucy and the Countess Have a Horse Guest&quot; reunited Ball and her former &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; co-star William Frawley, who played a small role as a horse trainer, for the last time. It was his last television appearance, six months before he died. In the episode credits, he&#x27;s listed as &quot;Our Own Bill Frawley&quot;

==Opening credits==

A different opening sequence was created for each season:
*Season 1 (1962–63): animated stick figures of Ball and Vance were used (similar to the ones used in the original opening sequences of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and of the subsequent 13 hour-long specials later syndicated in reruns as &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;).
*Season 2 (1963–1964): stills from previous episodes
*Season 3 (1964–1965): Clips appear from previous episodes
*Season 4 (1965–1966): Clips from previous episodes appear viewed from a kaleidoscope. The titles were designed by Howard Anderson Jr., who was also responsible for the &quot;heart&quot; opening for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.
*Season 5 (1966–1967): an additional opening was created at the beginning of the season that featured Lucille Ball as an animated &quot;jack-in-the-box&quot;. Ball reportedly hated it, and it was only used in a handful of episodes at the start of the season before being replaced by a slightly revamped version of the kaleidoscope opening. However, because of poor editing, the theme music to this opening was retained while the kaleidoscope opening played for several of the early 1966 fall episodes.
*Season 6 (1967–1968): the kaleidoscope opening was used once again, but the theme music was reorchestrated. Also the &quot;Glamour Shot&quot; of Ball at the end of the opening is a different clip than season five. For the episodes in which Gale Gordon did not appear, the &quot;Co-Starring: Gale Gordon&quot; voiceover was omitted from the audio track.

During later television airings, including 1970s and 1980s syndicated runs, as well as Nick at Nite&#x27;s 1990s reruns of the series, the later &quot;kaleidoscope&quot; opening was used in nearly all episodes (with a &quot;costarring Vivian Vance&quot; voiceover edited in for episodes from the first three seasons).

The theme music was composed by Wilbur Hatch, who was the show&#x27;s musical director, a role he also performed on Ball&#x27;s previous series &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

==Episodes==

===Unproduced episodes===
There were several scripts written that were never filmed. &quot;Lucy &amp; Viv Fight Over Harry&quot; was set to be produced as the 11th episode in the first season, but there were too many &quot;production problems&quot; and the episode was canceled. In an interview with Jimmy Garrett, he said the audience barely laughed at rehearsals, and Desi Arnaz cancelled the episode with Lucille Ball&#x27;s permission.
During season 2, both &quot;Lucy is a Girl Friday&quot; and &quot;Lucy Plays Basketball&quot; were canceled before filming began as well. The details of these &quot;lost&quot; episodes can be found on the official DVD sets for the first two seasons.

==Filming==

Unlike most sitcoms of the era, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; was filmed before a live audience; standard practice at the time was to film an episode on a closed set and add a laugh track during post-production. However, a laugh track was still used to fill any gaps in audience reactions or missed punchlines. The live format was used for all &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; episodes, for all but a few &quot;Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot; installments and on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Arnaz felt Ball performed better in front of a live studio audience. Carole Cook, Ball&#x27;s long-time friend and protégée in a radio show &quot;Great Lives&quot; based on Lucille Ball said that three cameras were used so to capture everything in one go, and the best angles would be used. While Ball would ad-lib during rehearsals, she followed the script when filming the actual show.

While filming the 1963 episode &quot;Lucy and Viv Put In A Shower&quot;, in which the leading ladies attempted to install a shower stall (but become trapped inside, unable to shut the water off), Ball nearly drowned while performing in the tank of water. She was unable to bring herself back to the surface, and it was Vance who realized there was a problem and pulled her co-star to safety; Vance went on to ad lib until Ball could catch her breath to resume speaking her lines (all the while, cameras continued to film). Neither the film crew nor the live studio audience realized there was a problem.

In her autobiography &quot;Love, Lucy&quot;, Lucy talks of this episode:

:...I found I had no room to . I couldn&#x27;t get back to the surface again. What&#x27;s more I swallowed a lot of water and was actually drowning right there in front of three hundred people who were splitting their sides laughing. Vivian (Vance), realising in cold terror what had happened, never changed expression. She reached down, pulled me safely to the surface by the roots of my hair and then calmly spoke both sides of our dialogue, putting my lines in the form of questions. Whatta girl! And whatta night.

The two special episodes to feature Ethel Merman (&quot;Lucy Teaches Ethel Merman to Sing&quot; and &quot;Ethel Merman and the Boy Scout Show&quot;) were originally just one episode, &quot;Lucy Teaches Ethel Merman to Sing&quot;. This installment was a consolation prize to Merman after her Desilu-produced pilot, &quot;Maggie Brown&quot;, was rejected as a regular series by CBS. The plot was much as it remains today with Lucy and Viv trying to pass off Agnes Schmidlap as Ethel Merman, not knowing that it really is Ethel Merman, and Lucy attempts to teach her how to sing. In the original version, Lucy&#x27;s voice lesson scene with Merman (which was lifted from the previous season&#x27;s episode &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Barbershop Quartet&quot; in which Hans Conried was the instructor and Lucy the pupil) was much shorter than it is today and that episode ended with the Boy Scout show, with Jerry Carmichael hosting, Sherman Bagley dancing, and Lucy joining Ethel for a brand new version of Merman&#x27;s great hit &quot;Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)&quot;. But then, Desilu Productions thought that maybe too much had been crammed into one half-hour and since Ball and Vance (who both were great friends of Merman) were having such a marvelous time working with the legendary Broadway belter, they decided to expand it into two episodes, thereby taking advantage of Merman&#x27;s formidable talents. So, a second filming was scheduled. In Part 1, Ethel was to be the houseguest of Lucy and Viv for a few weeks, and then in Part 2, a full blown episode was created that included scenes of Lucy once again, trying to get into the act. An all new Boy Scout show was filmed also, with Jerry once again hosting, Sherman dancing, and Lucy, Viv, and Ethel, this time joined by Mr. Mooney, singing and dancing through a history of show business.

An episode from the 1966–1967 season called &quot;Lucy Flies to London&quot; served as the basis for a standalone one-hour special called &quot;Lucy in London&quot;, which featured Ball with guest stars Anthony Newley and the Dave Clark Five. Much of the &quot;Lucy Flies to London&quot; episode, which centered around Lucy&#x27;s lack of experience in air travel, was based on an unsold pilot shot in 1960 that was written by Bob Carroll, Jr. and Madelyn Pugh Martin Davis. It starred Lucille Ball and Gale Gordon. Desi Arnaz was the director.

==Comic book==
A comic book adaptation, &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, was published by Gold Key Comics for five issues, from June 1963 to June 1964.

==Home media==
Before July 2009, there were only thirty episodes available on DVD and/or VHS (two episodes from the first season, twenty-one from the fifth season, and seven from the sixth season), all of which are believed to be in the public domain due to copyright oversights. These episodes have been released by unauthorized companies like Vintage Home Entertainment, Mill Creek Entertainment, Alpha Video, Digiview, Front Row Entertainment, Diamond Entertainment, Madacy Entertainment and Echo Bridge Home Entertainment.

CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount Home Entertainment) has released all six seasons of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; on DVD in Region 1, as of October 9, 2012. CBS announced that all the episodes have been restored and remastered using the original film negatives, and was presented uncut in its original broadcast form. However, some of the episodes were edited from the original, uncut versions due to expensive costing issues, as well as the original music scores were replaced due to music licensing issues.

The first three official DVD releases allow viewers to view the original openings, closings, and cast commercials directly in the episode, while the fourth, fifth and sixth season DVD releases do not have this function.

The Complete Series was released on November 15, 2016.

In Australia, The Complete Series was released on April 1, 2020, and is distributed by Shock Entertainment.

===Other releases===
In September 2018, Time-Life released a DVD, &quot;Lucy: The Ultimate Collection&quot;, that contains 24 episodes of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, and which also collected 32 episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, as well as 14 episodes of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, and 4 episodes of the short-lived ABC-TV series &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; (which had at the time never before been released to home media), plus a wide variety of bonus features.

<text>Here&#x27;s Lucy is an American sitcom starring Lucille Ball. The series co-starred her long-time comedy partner Gale Gordon and her real-life children Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr. It was broadcast on CBS from 1968 to 1974. It was Ball&#x27;s third network sitcom, following &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; (1951–57) and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; (1962–68).

==Background==
Though &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; was still popular during the 1967–68 season, finishing in the top five of the ratings (at #2), Ball opted to end that series at the end of that season, as there were enough episodes for syndicated reruns, and as Ball had sold Desilu Productions (which owned and produced &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;) to Gulf &amp; Western. Ball, who had stated that she did not wish to continue to star in a show that she no longer owned, also made it known that she did not wish to continue to star in a show unless her two children agreed to co-star, and thus an entirely new show was written for this purpose. Doris Singleton, who played Carolyn Appleby on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, has said she was originally going to be a series regular on the show as Harry Carter&#x27;s secretary, but the idea was dropped when Lucy brought her children on board with the show. &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; was produced by Ball&#x27;s newly created production company, Lucille Ball Productions. Desilu&#x27;s successor Paramount Television co-produced the first season, but sold its stake in the show to Ball afterwards.

Unlike most sitcoms of the era, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; was filmed before a live audience; standard practice at the time was to film an episode on a closed set and add a laugh track during post-production. However, a laugh track was still used to fill any gaps in audience reactions or missed punchlines. The live format was requested by Ball herself, as she believed that she performed better in the presence of an audience.

The title sequence animation was by Jim Danforth.

==Premise==

The program&#x27;s premise changed from &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Unlike Ball&#x27;s character on the previous program — Lucy Carmichael, who originally lived in New York and later moved to California — in her third sitcom, Ball&#x27;s character of Lucy Hinkley Carter was already living in Los Angeles, and once again bore a name containing &quot;ar&quot; in tribute to her ex-husband Desi Arnaz. In this new incarnation, Lucy was a widow with two children named Kim and Craig, played by her real life children, Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr. (who, in real life, was part of the teen pop band Dino, Desi &amp; Billy). She was employed at &quot;Carter&#x27;s Unique Employment Agency&quot; by her bachelor brother-in-law Harry, played by Gale Gordon in a role similar to his Mr. Mooney role from &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Mary Jane Croft, who had been a regular featured player on the last three seasons of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, also became a semi-regular on the new series. Character actress Vanda Barra, who had played small parts on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, was also added to this sitcom and gradually was upgraded. Towards the end of the run of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, Barra became part of the ensemble cast. Ball&#x27;s longtime costar Vivian Vance also made six guest appearances as Vivian Jones through the series&#x27; run.

The series was created by Milt Josefsberg and Bob O&#x27;Brien in 1968. They wanted to comically present the &quot;generation gap&quot; struggle between a working mother and her two increasingly independent teenagers. They wanted change this time around and to escape the shows for which Lucy had previously been so well known. They touched upon current events (civil rights, rock music, the sexual revolution and changing gender/sexual mores).

The writers interviewed Lucie and Desi Jr. to allow a more realistic approach to how teenagers acted. In addition, they were given free rein to choose the names for their respective characters.

==Cast==

==Episodes==

==Guest stars and notable episodes==
Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor guest-starred in the 1970 third season opener, in a storyline involving their famous diamond, which becomes stuck on Lucy&#x27;s finger. Ball and Burton reportedly did not get along, as he found Ball&#x27;s rigid perfectionism grating; he subsequently wrote about her in extremely unflattering terms in his memoir. (The episode reunited Ball with longtime cowriters Madelyn Pugh Davis and Bob Carroll Jr. for the first time since both writers had left &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; in 1964.) Another noteworthy episode was &quot;Lucy Visits Jack Benny.&quot; In addition to Benny, Jackie Gleason made a surprise cameo reprising his role of bus driver Ralph Kramden.

During its run, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; featured a number of famous guest stars, many of whom were Ball&#x27;s real-life friends, often playing themselves, including Vivian Vance, Ann-Margret, Milton Berle, Carol Burnett, George Burns, Ruth Buzzi, Johnny Carson, Liberace, Petula Clark, John Davidson, Eva Gabor, Helen Hayes, Dean Martin, Eve McVeagh, Vincent Price, Tony Randall, Buddy Rich, Joan Rivers, Ginger Rogers, Dinah Shore, Danny Thomas, Lawrence Welk, Flip Wilson, Shelley Winters, Donny Osmond and Patty Andrews.

Ball appeared as herself in an episode in which Lucy Carter enters a Lucille Ball look-alike contest. This episode, designed to cross-promote Ball&#x27;s then current film &quot;Mame&quot;, enabled Ball to appear on screen with herself.

Mary Treen was cast as Mary Winters in the series finale, the 1974 episode &quot;Lucy Fights the System&quot;. 
===Proposed spin-off===
At the end of the third season, Desi Arnaz, Jr. decided to leave the series to pursue a movie acting career. His character of Craig returned in the fifth-season episode &quot;Lucy and Joe Namath&#x27;, but after that he never again appeared on the show although Craig was referred to from time to time. With Desi Jr.&#x27;s absence, Lucie Arnaz&#x27;s character of Kim became more a prominent part of the program as well as a strong comedic foil for both Ball and Gordon.

During the fourth season, the producers proposed a spin-off of the show for Kim, titled &quot;The Lucie Arnaz Show&quot;. The show would have Kim and her friend Sue (Susan Tolsky) live in their own apartment in a building run by Lucy&#x27;s brother, Herb Hinkley (Alan Oppenheimer), who is very over protective of Kim.
The show was a back-door pilot, airing as the season four finale. The pilot was anticipated to be picked up as a weekly series.

The week before this installment aired, Vivian Vance made her annual (and final) appearance on &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; in the episode &quot;With Viv as a Friend, Who Needs an Enemy?&quot; Vance had moved back to California by this time and Ball was so thrilled to work with her again that she asked Vance to rejoin her as her comrade on &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; the following season if her daughter&#x27;s pilot sold to CBS. However, Arnaz&#x27;s show was not well received and was not included in the 1972–73 fall lineup. In addition, shortly after finishing the episode with Ball, Vance was diagnosed with breast cancer and then suffered a slight stroke. Lucie Arnaz remained with &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; until the show ended in the spring of 1974.

The pilot, &quot;Kim Finally Cuts You-Know-Whose Apron Strings&quot;, was written by &quot;Lucy&quot; veteran writers Madelyn Davis &amp; Bob Carroll, Jr.

====Cast====
*Lucie Arnaz as Kim Carter
*Susan Tolsky as Sue
*Alan Oppenheimer as Herb Hinkley

Lucie Arnaz eventually did star in her own self-named show The Lucie Arnaz Show in 1985 but that was unrelated to the premise of proposed Here&#x27;s Lucy spin-off.

==Final seasons==
In 1972, shortly before filming of the fifth season began, Ball broke her right leg in a skiing accident. As a result, the fifth season saw a season-long storyline where in the character of Lucy Carter also had a broken leg. Both Ball and Lucy Carter spent much of the season in a wheelchair and full-leg cast. According to Geoffrey Mark Fidelman, author of &quot;The Lucy Book&quot;, this was the point where the &quot;Lucy&quot; character was &quot;finally allowed to age.&quot;

Ball&#x27;s injury and recovery severely limited her ability to perform physical comedy during the season. This gave the other members of the cast, such as Lucie Arnaz and featured players Mary Jane Croft and Vanda Barra, a chance to shine. It also gave Gale Gordon&#x27;s character of Harry a chance to be more sympathetic and affectionate toward Lucy, which had been completely missing since Gordon first joined the cast of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; nine years earlier. A thaw in the relationship between Lucy and Harry accelerated, so that they could interact more as friendly in-laws rather than just as antagonistic co-workers.

Despite Ball&#x27;s injury, physical comedy was never completely eliminated. During the recovery, there were small gags that Ball could safely perform with little to no general injury or harm to her leg. As her recovery progressed, Ball was able to take on more physical comedy routines. However, the slapstick aspects were still toned down for the remainder of the series in comparison to earlier seasons.

By the spring of 1973, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; had fallen to #15 in the ratings ─ the first time that a series starring Lucille Ball had fallen out of the top ten. Unsure of whether she wanted to continue, Ball and Gale Gordon filmed a season finale without a studio audience present. In that installment, Harry&#x27;s business was sold and he and Lucy reminisced together (using flashbacks) about their various adventures together. At the end of the episode, they both leave the office. Lucy then leaves a sign that says &quot;closed temporarily&quot;, then she looks at the camera and winks. At the last minute, CBS president Fred Silverman convinced Ball to return for a sixth season.

On February 27, 1974, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Ball had officially told CBS she would not continue the series. Lucie Arnaz chose to leave the series after being cast in the national tour of &quot;Seesaw&quot;, while Ball was launching a film comeback with &quot;Mame&quot;. Without either of her children, and with enough episodes for syndication, Ball made the decision to end the series. CBS was also in the process of reinventing its image, having already replaced much of their &quot;old guard&quot; television product with more contemporary fare such as &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;, and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Except for &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, which would remain for one more season, Ball was the last performer from TV&#x27;s classic age who still had a weekly series at the beginning of 1974. Between 1974 and 1978, still under contract, Ball would star in seven television specials for CBS.

==Syndication and rights issues==
&quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; was not initially offered in syndication when the series ended in 1974 because both &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, which was being distributed by Viacom at the time, and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, which was being distributed by Paramount, were still popular in reruns and it was felt that introducing another &quot;Lucy&quot; series might undermine the success the other two shows were enjoying. This would also have put Ball in the position of competing against her former series and former production company for ratings, since she no longer had control of either &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; or &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; after selling Desilu Productions to Paramount’s parent company Gulf + Western.

The show was originally offered internationally, first by Paramount Television, then by John Pearson International, a company formed by ex-Desilu/Paramount employee John Pearson, who controls foreign sales of the series.

CBS retained the rights to run the show in daytime. CBS Daytime reran the series weekday mornings from May 2 to November 4, 1977, in the same time-slot that they had previously rerun &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; from 1968 to 1972, and before that (1959–67) had at various times rerun &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;. Finally, in the fall of 1981, &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; was put into broadcast syndication first by Telepictures, who had acquired the rights to the series in 1980, and in turn the rights were later transferred to Warner Bros. Television Distribution (which acquired Telepictures&#x27; successor, Lorimar-Telepictures). &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; was not successful in syndication and was withdrawn in 1985.

Largely forgotten in the late 1980s and early 1990s and rarely carried by the cable networks, reruns of the series were returned to air by Pax TV in 1998. Cozi TV began airing the show on August 11, 2014. The show&#x27;s current distributor is Paul Brownstein Productions.

The program was shown in Britain by the BBC fairly soon after it was made, in the Saturday tea-time (mid-afternoon) slot, but it has not been shown often since.

It was seen in Australia on the GO! channel from 31 May 2010 until November 2010. For many years prior to that on Australian television, the show was distributed by Pacific Telecasters Pty. Ltd before being later transferred to Warner Bros. Television. It was a perennial favourite seen on the Nine Network from 1968 to 1988 and in 1992 on ABC Television. Prior to GO!, the show screened on Ovation.

As of 2018, the show is available on Amazon Prime Video in Canada and the USA. As of 2019, it is also available on Pluto in the United States, and Tubi.

==Home media==
On August 17, 2004, Shout! Factory and Sony Music Entertainment released &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy: Best Loved Episodes from the Hit Television Series&quot;. The four-disc set features 24 original episodes from the series presented uncut and digitally remastered from original color negatives for superior quality, as well as several bonus features.

On March 25, 2014, MPI Home Video—under license from the copyright holders, &quot;Desilu, Too&quot;, and Lucille Ball Productions, Inc.—released &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

In Region 4, Madman Entertainment has released all six seasons on DVD in Australia.

===Other releases===
In September 2018, Time-Life released a DVD, &quot;Lucy: The Ultimate Collection&quot;, that contains 14 episodes of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, and which also collected 32 episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, as well as 24 episodes of &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, and 4 episodes of the short-lived ABC-TV series &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; (which had at the time never before been released to home media), plus a wide variety of bonus features.

<doc id="543406" wikidata="Q355981" url="?curid=543406" title="Adenitis">
<text>Adenitis is a general term for an inflammation of a gland. Often it is used to refer to lymphadenitis which is the inflammation of a lymph node.

==Classification==

===Lymph node adenitis===

&quot;Lymph adenitis&quot; or &quot;lymph node adenitis&quot; is caused by infection in lymph nodes. The infected lymph nodes typically become enlarged, warm and tender. A swelling of lymph nodes due to growth of lymph cells is called lymphadenopathy. Types include:
* Neck
** Cervical adenitis is an inflammation of a lymph node in the neck.
** Tuberculous adenitis (scrofula) is a tuberculous infection of the skin of the neck caused by &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;. Non-tuberculous adenitis can also be caused by &quot;Mycobacterium scrofulaceum&quot; or &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot;.
* Abdomen
** Mesenteric adenitis is an inflammation of the mesenteric lymph nodes in the abdomen. It can be caused by the bacterium &quot;Yersinia enterocolitica&quot;. If it occurs in the right lower quadrant, it can be mistaken for acute appendicitis, often preceded by a sore throat. Clinical manifestations may include fever, right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Most often occurs in children age 5–14.

===Other===
Sebaceous adenitis is an inflammation of the sebaceous glands
in the skin. These glands normally produce sebum (skin oil, a lipid-rich secretion) which prevents drying of the skin.

<doc id="543407" wikidata="Q84115" url="?curid=543407" title="Torque converter">
<text>A torque converter is a device, usually implemented as a type of fluid coupling, that transfers rotating power from a prime mover, like an internal combustion engine, to a rotating driven load. In a vehicle with an automatic transmission, the torque converter connects the prime mover to the automatic gear train, which then drives the load. It is thus usually located between the engine&#x27;s flexplate and the transmission. The equivalent device in a manual transmission is the mechanical clutch.

A torque converter serves to increase transmitted torque when the output rotational speed is low. In the fluid coupling embodiment, it uses a fluid, driven by the vanes of an input impeller, and directed through the vanes of a fixed stator, to drive an output turbine in such a manner that torque on the output is increased when the output shaft is rotating more slowly than the input shaft, thus providing the equivalent of an adaptive reduction gear. This is a feature beyond what a simple fluid coupling provides, which can match rotational speed but does not multiply torque. Fluid-coupling–based torque converters also typically include a lock-up function to rigidly couple input and output and avoid the efficiency losses associated with transmitting torque by fluid flow when operating conditions permit.

==Hydraulic systems==
By far the most common form of torque converter in automobile transmissions is the hydrodynamic device described above. There are also hydrostatic systems which are widely used in small machines such as compact excavators.

==Mechanical systems==
There are also mechanical designs for torque converters, many of which are similar to mechanical continuously variable transmissions or capable of acting as such as well. They include the pendulum-based Constantinesco torque converter, the Lambert friction gearing disk drive transmission and the 
Variomatic with expanding pulleys and a belt drive.

==Usage==
* Automatic transmissions on automobiles, such as cars, buses, and on/off highway trucks.
* Forwarders and other heavy duty vehicles.
* Marine propulsion systems.
* Industrial power transmission such as conveyor drives, almost all modern forklifts, winches, drilling rigs, construction equipment, and diesel-hydraulic railway locomotives.

==Function==

===Theory of operation===
Torque converter equations of motion are governed by Leonhard Euler&#x27;s eighteenth century turbomachine equation:
:formula_1

The equation expands to include the fifth power of radius; as a result, torque converter properties are very dependent on the size of the device.

Mathematical formulations for the torque converter are available from several authors.

Hrovat derived the equations of the pump, turbine, stator, and conservation of energy. Four first-order differential equations can define the performance of the torque converter.

===Torque converter elements===
A fluid coupling is a two-element drive that is incapable of multiplying torque, while a torque converter has at least one extra element—the stator—which alters the drive&#x27;s characteristics during periods of high slippage, producing an increase in output torque.

In a torque converter there are at least three rotating elements: the impeller, which is mechanically driven by the ; the turbine, which drives the load; and the stator, which is interposed between the impeller and turbine so that it can alter oil flow returning from the turbine to the impeller. The classic torque converter design dictates that the stator be prevented from rotating under any condition, hence the term &quot;stator&quot;. In practice, however, the stator is mounted on an overrunning clutch, which prevents the stator from counter-rotating with respect to the prime mover but allows forward rotation.

Modifications to the basic three element design have been periodically incorporated, especially in applications where higher than normal torque multiplication is required. Most commonly, these have taken the form of multiple turbines and stators, each set being designed to produce differing amounts of torque multiplication. For example, the Buick Dynaflow automatic transmission was a non-shifting design and, under normal conditions, relied solely upon the converter to multiply torque. The Dynaflow used a five-element converter to produce the wide range of torque multiplication needed to propel a heavy vehicle.

Although not strictly a part of classic torque converter design, many automotive converters include a lock-up clutch to improve cruising power transmission efficiency and reduce heat. The application of the clutch locks the turbine to the impeller, causing all power transmission to be mechanical, thus eliminating losses associated with fluid drive.

===Operational phases===
A torque converter has three stages of operation:

*Stall. The prime mover is applying power to the impeller but the turbine cannot rotate. For example, in an automobile, this stage of operation would occur when the driver has placed the transmission in gear but is preventing the vehicle from moving by continuing to apply the brakes. At stall, the torque converter can produce maximum torque multiplication if sufficient input power is applied (the resulting multiplication is called the &quot;stall ratio&quot;). The stall phase actually lasts for a brief period when the load (e.g., vehicle) initially starts to move, as there will be a very large difference between pump and turbine speed.
*Acceleration. The load is accelerating but there still is a relatively large difference between impeller and turbine speed. Under this condition, the converter will produce torque multiplication that is less than what could be achieved under stall conditions. The amount of multiplication will depend upon the actual difference between pump and turbine speed, as well as various other design factors.
*Coupling. The turbine has reached approximately 90 percent of the speed of the impeller. Torque multiplication has essentially ceased and the torque converter is behaving in a manner similar to a simple fluid coupling. In modern automotive applications, it is usually at this stage of operation where the lock-up clutch is applied, a procedure that tends to improve fuel efficiency.

The key to the torque converter&#x27;s ability to multiply torque lies in the stator. In the classic fluid coupling design, periods of high slippage cause the fluid flow returning from the turbine to the impeller to oppose the direction of impeller rotation, leading to a significant loss of efficiency and the generation of considerable waste heat. Under the same condition in a torque converter, the returning fluid will be redirected by the stator so that it aids the rotation of the impeller, instead of impeding it. The result is that much of the energy in the returning fluid is recovered and added to the energy being applied to the impeller by the prime mover. This action causes a substantial increase in the mass of fluid being directed to the turbine, producing an increase in output torque. Since the returning fluid is initially traveling in a direction opposite to impeller rotation, the stator will likewise attempt to counter-rotate as it forces the fluid to change direction, an effect that is prevented by the one-way stator clutch.

Unlike the radially straight blades used in a plain fluid coupling, a torque converter&#x27;s turbine and stator use angled and curved blades. The blade shape of the stator is what alters the path of the fluid, forcing it to coincide with the impeller rotation. The matching curve of the turbine blades helps to correctly direct the returning fluid to the stator so the latter can do its job. The shape of the blades is important as minor variations can result in significant changes to the converter&#x27;s performance.

During the stall and acceleration phases, in which torque multiplication occurs, the stator remains stationary due to the action of its one-way clutch. However, as the torque converter approaches the coupling phase, the energy and volume of the fluid returning from the turbine will gradually decrease, causing pressure on the stator to likewise decrease. Once in the coupling phase, the returning fluid will reverse direction and now rotate in the direction of the impeller and turbine, an effect which will attempt to forward-rotate the stator. At this point, the stator clutch will release and the impeller, turbine and stator will all (more or less) turn as a unit.

Unavoidably, some of the fluid&#x27;s kinetic energy will be lost due to friction and turbulence, causing the converter to generate waste heat (dissipated in many applications by water cooling). This effect, often referred to as pumping loss, will be most pronounced at or near stall conditions. In modern designs, the blade geometry minimizes oil velocity at low impeller speeds, which allows the turbine to be stalled for long periods with little danger of overheating (as when a vehicle with an automatic transmission is stopped at a traffic signal or in traffic congestion while still in gear).

===Efficiency and torque multiplication===
A torque converter cannot achieve 100 percent coupling efficiency. The classic three element torque converter has an efficiency curve that resembles ∩: zero efficiency at stall, generally increasing efficiency during the acceleration phase and low efficiency in the coupling phase. The loss of efficiency as the converter enters the coupling phase is a result of the turbulence and fluid flow interference generated by the stator, and as previously mentioned, is commonly overcome by mounting the stator on a one-way clutch.

Even with the benefit of the one-way stator clutch, a converter cannot achieve the same level of efficiency in the coupling phase as an equivalently sized fluid coupling. Some loss is due to the presence of the stator (even though rotating as part of the assembly), as it always generates some power-absorbing turbulence. Most of the loss, however, is caused by the curved and angled turbine blades, which do not absorb kinetic energy from the fluid mass as well as radially straight blades. Since the turbine blade geometry is a crucial factor in the converter&#x27;s ability to multiply torque, trade-offs between torque multiplication and coupling efficiency are inevitable. In automotive applications, where steady improvements in fuel economy have been mandated by market forces and government edict, the nearly universal use of a lock-up clutch has helped to eliminate the converter from the efficiency equation during cruising operation.

The maximum amount of torque multiplication produced by a converter is highly dependent on the size and geometry of the turbine and stator blades, and is generated only when the converter is at or near the stall phase of operation. Typical stall torque multiplication ratios range from 1.8:1 to 2.5:1 for most automotive applications. Specialized converters designed for industrial, rail, or heavy marine power transmission systems are capable of as much as 5.0:1 multiplication. Generally speaking, there is a trade-off between maximum torque multiplication and efficiency—high stall ratio converters tend to be relatively inefficient around the coupling speed, whereas low stall ratio converters tend to provide less possible torque multiplication.

The characteristics of the torque converter must be carefully matched to the torque curve of the power source and the intended application. Changing the blade geometry of the stator and/or turbine will change the torque-stall characteristics, as well as the overall efficiency of the unit. For example, drag racing automatic transmissions often use converters modified to produce high stall speeds to improve off-the-line torque, and to get into the power band of the engine more quickly. Highway vehicles generally use lower stall torque converters to limit heat production, and provide a more firm feeling to the vehicle&#x27;s characteristics.

A design feature once found in some General Motors automatic transmissions was the variable-pitch stator, in which the blades&#x27; angle of attack could be varied in response to changes in engine speed and load. The effect of this was to vary the amount of torque multiplication produced by the converter. At the normal angle of attack, the stator caused the converter to produce a moderate amount of multiplication but with a higher level of efficiency. If the driver abruptly opened the throttle, a valve would switch the stator pitch to a different angle of attack, increasing torque multiplication at the expense of efficiency.

Some torque converters use multiple stators and/or multiple turbines to provide a wider range of torque multiplication. Such multiple-element converters are more common in industrial environments than in automotive transmissions, but automotive applications such as Buick&#x27;s Triple Turbine Dynaflow and Chevrolet&#x27;s Turboglide also existed. The Buick Dynaflow utilized the torque-multiplying characteristics of its planetary gear set in conjunction with the torque converter for low gear and bypassed the first turbine, using only the second turbine as vehicle speed increased. The unavoidable trade-off with this arrangement was low efficiency and eventually these transmissions were discontinued in favor of the more efficient three speed units with a conventional three element torque converter.
It is also found that efficiency of torque converter is maximum at very low speeds.

===Lock-up torque converters===
As described above, impelling losses within the torque converter reduce efficiency and generate waste heat. In modern automotive applications, this problem is commonly avoided by use of a lock-up clutch that physically links the impeller and turbine, effectively changing the converter into a purely mechanical coupling. The result is no slippage, and virtually no power loss.

The first automotive application of the lock-up principle was Packard&#x27;s Ultramatic transmission, introduced in 1949, which locked up the converter at cruising speeds, unlocking when the throttle was floored for quick acceleration or as the vehicle slowed. This feature was also present in some Borg-Warner transmissions produced during the 1950s. It fell out of favor in subsequent years due to its extra complexity and cost. In the late 1970s lock-up clutches started to reappear in response to demands for improved fuel economy, and are now nearly universal in automotive applications.

===Capacity and failure modes===
As with a basic fluid coupling the theoretical torque capacity of a converter is proportional to formula_16, where formula_17 is the mass density of the fluid (kg/m3), formula_18 is the impeller speed (rpm), and formula_19 is the diameter (m). In practice, the maximum torque capacity is limited by the mechanical characteristics of the materials used in the converter&#x27;s components, as well as the ability of the converter to dissipate heat (often through water cooling). As an aid to strength, reliability and economy of production, most automotive converter housings are of welded construction. Industrial units are usually assembled with bolted housings, a design feature that eases the process of inspection and repair, but adds to the cost of producing the converter.

In high performance, racing and heavy duty commercial converters, the pump and turbine may be further strengthened by a process called furnace brazing, in which molten brass is drawn into seams and joints to produce a stronger bond between the blades, hubs and annular ring(s). Because the furnace brazing process creates a small radius at the point where a blade meets with a hub or annular ring, a theoretical decrease in turbulence will occur, resulting in a corresponding increase in efficiency.

Overloading a converter can result in several failure modes, some of them potentially dangerous in nature:

*Overheating: Continuous high levels of slippage may overwhelm the converter&#x27;s ability to dissipate heat, resulting in damage to the elastomer seals that retain fluid inside the converter. A prime example in passenger cars would be getting stuck in snow or mud and having to rock the vehicle forward and backward to gain momentum by going back and forth from drive to reverse using significant power. The transmission fluid will quickly overheat, not to mention the repeated impacts on the stator clutch (next topic). Also, overheating transmission fluid causes it to lose viscosity and damage the transmission. Such abuse can in rare cases cause the torque converter to leak and eventually stop functioning due to lack of fluid.
*Stator clutch seizure: The inner and outer elements of the one-way stator clutch become permanently locked together, thus preventing the stator from rotating during the coupling phase. Most often, seizure is precipitated by severe loading and subsequent distortion of the clutch components. Eventually, galling of the mating parts occurs, which triggers seizure. A converter with a seized stator clutch will exhibit very poor efficiency during the coupling phase, and in a motor vehicle, fuel consumption will drastically increase. Converter overheating under such conditions will usually occur if continued operation is attempted.
*Stator clutch breakage: A very abrupt application of power, as in putting the transmission in neutral and increasing engine RPMs before engaging a gear (commonly called a &quot;neutral start&quot;), can cause shock loading of the stator clutch, resulting in breakage. If this occurs, the stator will freely counter-rotate in the direction opposite to that of the pump and almost no power transmission will take place. In an automobile, the effect is similar to a severe case of transmission slippage and the vehicle is all but incapable of moving under its own power.
*Blade deformation and fragmentation: If subjected to abrupt loading or excessive heating of the converter, pump and/or turbine blades may be deformed, separated from their hubs and/or annular rings, or may break up into fragments. At the least, such a failure will result in a significant loss of efficiency, producing symptoms similar (although less pronounced) to those accompanying stator clutch failure. In extreme cases, catastrophic destruction of the converter will occur.
*Ballooning: Prolonged operation under excessive loading, very abrupt application of load, or operating a torque converter at very high RPM may cause the shape of the converter&#x27;s housing to be physically distorted due to internal pressure and/or the stress imposed by inertia. Under extreme conditions, ballooning will cause the converter housing to rupture, resulting in the violent dispersal of hot oil and metal fragments over a wide area.

<text>Gale Gordon (born Charles Thomas Aldrich Jr., February 20, 1906 – June 30, 1995) was an American character actor who was Lucille Ball&#x27;s longtime television foil, particularly as cantankerously combustible, tightfisted bank executive Theodore J. Mooney, on Ball&#x27;s second television sitcom &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Gordon also appeared in &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and had starring roles in Ball&#x27;s successful third series &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; and her short-lived fourth and final series &quot;Life with Lucy&quot;.

Gordon was also a radio actor who played school principal Osgood Conklin in &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;, starring Eve Arden, in both the 1948–1957 radio series and the 1952–1956 television series. He also co-starred as the second Mr. Wilson in &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, replacing Joseph Kearns after he died.

==Career==
===Radio===
Born Charles Thomas Aldrich Jr. in New York City to vaudevillian Charles Thomas Aldrich and his wife, English actress Gloria Gordon, Gale Gordon&#x27;s first big radio break came via the recurring roles of &quot;Mayor La Trivia&quot; and &quot;Foggy Williams&quot; on &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot;, before playing Rumson Bullard on the show&#x27;s successful spinoff, &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot;. Gordon and his character of Mayor La Trivia left the show during World War II when Gordon enlisted in the US Coast Guard, where he spent four years. He was the first actor to play the role of Flash Gordon, in the 1935 radio serial &quot;The Amazing Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon&quot;. He also played Dr. Stevens in &quot;Glorious One&quot;.

From 1937 to 1939, he starred as &quot;The Octopus&quot; in the &quot;Speed Gibson&quot; adventure series. In 1949, Gordon recorded the pilot for &quot;The Halls of Ivy&quot;, starring in the program&#x27;s title role of Dr. Todhunter Hall, the president of Ivy College. The pilot led to a radio series that aired from 1950 to 1952, but Ronald Colman replaced Gordon in the title role; Gordon later joined the cast as a replacement for Willard Waterman in the popular role of John Merriweather.

Gordon, in one of his few dramatic roles on radio, starred as erudite art importer, suave bachelor, and amateur sleuth Gregory Hood on &quot;The Casebook of Gregory Hood&quot; in 1946–47 on the &quot;Mutual Broadcasting Network&quot;. The show followed the same format—same sponsor, same writers, same storytelling formula—as the program it was originally a summer replacement for, &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The Gregory Hood program was continued on the fall schedule for the subsequent season after the network failed to reach a contractual agreement with the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for the Sherlock Holmes franchise. It was cancelled by Mutual after one full season, but returned periodically on ABC in 1948 and following years, with other actors playing the title role.

In 1950, Gordon played John Granby, a former city dweller ineptly pursuing his dream of life on a farm, in the radio series &quot;Granby&#x27;s Green Acres&quot;, which became the basis for the 1960s television series &quot;Green Acres&quot;. Gordon went on to create the role of pompous principal Osgood Conklin on &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot;, carrying the role to television when the show moved there in 1952. In the interim, Gordon turned up as Rudolph Atterbury on &quot;My Favorite Husband&quot;, which starred Lucille Ball in a precursor to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;.

Gordon and Ball had previously worked together on &quot;The Wonder Show&quot;, starring Jack Haley, from 1938 to 1939. The two had a long friendship as well as recurring professional partnership. Gordon also had a recurring role as fictitious Rexall Drugs sponsor representative Mr. Scott on yet another radio hit, &quot;The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show&quot;, staying with the role as long as Rexall sponsored the show. When the sponsor changed to RCA, the character simply switched employers.

===Television===

The widely acknowledged master of the &quot;slow-burn&quot; temper explosion in character, Gordon was the first pick to play Fred Mertz on &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, but he was committed to &quot;Our Miss Brooks&quot; as well as being a regular on several other radio shows, and had to decline the offer (the role went to William Frawley). He appeared in two guest shots on the show: twice as Ricky Ricardo&#x27;s boss, Alvin Littlefield, owner of the Tropicana Club where Ricky&#x27;s band played, and later appeared as a judge on an episode of &quot;Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour&quot;.

In 1958, Gordon appeared as a regular in the role of department store co-owner Bascomb Bleacher Sr., on the NBC sitcom &quot;Sally&quot;, starring Joan Caulfield and Marion Lorne. He also appeared on the Walter Brennan ABC sitcom, &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;. Gordon had a co-starring role in the CBS television comedy &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot;. At this time, he guest starred with Pat O&#x27;Brien in the ABC sitcom, &quot;Harrigan and Son&quot;, the story of a father-and-son lawyer team. He also appeared on the CBS/Desilu sitcom, &quot;Angel&quot;, with Annie Fargé. On &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;, he guest starred in seven episodes. In five, he played the landlord of the building where the Williams family lived. In 1962, Gordon appeared as different characters on two episodes of another ABC sitcom, &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;.

In 1962, Ball created &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and planned to hire Gordon to play Theodore J. Mooney, the banker who was first Lucy Carmichael&#x27;s executor and subsequently her employer, when she went to work in his bank. Gordon was under contract to play John Wilson (after the death of Joseph Kearns, who played George Wilson) on &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;. Prior to Gordon&#x27;s replacing Kearns on &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, the two had worked together on an old radio show, &quot;The Cinnamon Bear&quot; and also appeared with Eve Arden and Richard Crenna in Our Miss Brooks (1953–55), where Kearns first played Assistant Superintendent Michaels and later (in eight episodes) as Superintendent Stone, a role that he had played on radio.
When &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; ended in spring 1963, Gordon joined &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; as Mr. Mooney for the 1963–64 season. (In the interim, Charles Lane played the similar Mr. Barnsdahl character for the 1962–1963 season.) The somewhat portly Gordon was surprisingly adept at physical comedy and could do a perfect cartwheel; he did this on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, and again as a guest on &quot;The Dean Martin Show&quot;.

After the sale of Desilu Studios in 1968, Ball shut down &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and retooled it into &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; and became her own producer and distributor. Gordon returned, this time as her blustery boss (and brother-in-law) Harrison Otis &#x27;Uncle Harry&#x27; Carter at an employment agency that specialized in unusual jobs for unusual people. Essentially, it was just a continuation of the Lucy Carmichael/Mr. Mooney relationship, but with new names and a new setting.

Gordon had all but retired from acting when &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; ended in 1974, but Ball coaxed him out of retirement in 1986 to join her for the short-lived series &quot;Life with Lucy&quot;. Gordon was the only actor to have co-starred or guest-starred in every weekly series, radio or television, Ball had done since the 1940s. His final acting appearance would be a reprise of Mr. Mooney in the first episode of &quot;Hi Honey, I&#x27;m Home!&quot; in 1991.

Beginning in 1949, Gordon and his wife lived in the tiny community of Borrego Springs, California (pop. 1,500) where he owned a ranch and several dogs. He was also honorary mayor of the town and commuted approximately to and from Los Angeles every day when working for Ball.

===Author, painter and rancher===
In addition to acting, Gordon was an accomplished author, penning two books in the 1940s entitled &quot;Nursery Rhymes for Hollywood Babies&quot; and &quot;Leaves from the Story Trees&quot;, and two one-act plays. After he and his wife purchased in Borrego Springs, Gordon did much of the construction of the house and his art studio himself. He also built and restored his own furniture on the property and used the land to become one of the few commercial carob growers in the United States. 

&quot;Gale Gordon: From Mayor of Wistful Vista to Borrego Springs,&quot; by Jim Manago, published by BearManor Media in 2016, is the first biography of Gordon.

==Death==
Gordon died of lung cancer on June 30, 1995, at the Redwood Terrace Health Center in Escondido, California, aged 89. Virginia Curley, his wife of nearly 60 years, had died in the same facility one month earlier. The couple had no children.

==Awards==
In 1999, Gordon was inducted posthumously into the Radio Hall of Fame, and for his contribution to radio he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6340 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>In Greek mythology, Clio ( , ; ), also spelled Kleio, Сleio, or Cleo, is the muse of history, or in a few mythological accounts, the muse of lyre-playing.

== Etymology ==
Clio&#x27;s name is etymologically derived from the Greek root κλέω/κλείω (meaning &quot;to recount&quot;, &quot;to make famous&quot; or &quot;to celebrate&quot;). The name&#x27;s traditional Latinisation is Clio, but some modern systems such as the American Library Association-Library of Congress system use &quot;K&quot; to represent the original Greek &quot;kappa&quot;, and &quot;ei&quot; to represent the diphthong &quot;ει&quot; (epsilon iota), thus &quot;Kleio&quot;.

== Depiction ==
Clio, sometimes referred to as &quot;the Proclaimer&quot;, is often represented with an open parchment scroll, a book, or a set of tablets. She is also shown with the heroic trumpet and the clepsydra (water clock). Cesare Ripa&#x27;s &quot;Iconologia&quot;, an important source book for artists of the Baroque period, stated that Clio should be depicted with a crown of laurels, a trumpet and an open book.

== Mythology ==
Like all the muses, Clio is a daughter of Zeus and the Titaness Mnemosyne, goddess of memory. Along with her sister Muses, she is considered to dwell at either Mount Helicon or Mount Parnassos. Other common locations for the Muses are Pieria in Thessaly, near to Mount Olympus.

She had one son, Hyacinth, with one of several kings, in various mythswith Pierus or with king Oebalus of Sparta, or with king Amyclas, progenitor of the people of Amyclae, dwellers about Sparta. In a scholium to Euripides&#x27; &quot;Rhesus&quot;, she is also the mother of Hymenaeus and Rhesus. According to Apollodorus, Clio was made to fall in love with Pierus by Aphrodite, for Clio had derided her for her love affair with Adonis. Other accounts credit her as the mother of Linus by Magnes, a poet who was buried at Argos, although Linus has a number of differing parents depending upon the account, including several accounts in which he is the son of Clio&#x27;s sisters Urania or Calliope.

== Legacy ==
In her capacity as &quot;the proclaimer, glorifier and celebrator of history, great deeds and accomplishments&quot; Clio is used in the name of various modern brands, including the Clio Awards for excellence in advertising.

The Cambridge University History Society is informally referred to as Clio; the Cleo of Alpha Chi society at Trinity College, Connecticut, is named after the muse. Likewise, the undergraduate student outreach group for the Penn Museum at the University of Pennsylvania is known as the Clio Society, and the first sorority founded at SUNY Geneseo, Phi Kappa Pi, began as the Alpha Clionian literary society. &quot;Clio&quot; also represents history in some coined words in academic usage: cliometrics, cliodynamics.

Clio Bay in Antarctica is named after the muse.

<text>The Renault Clio () is a supermini (B-segment) car, produced by French automobile manufacturer Renault. It was launched in 1990, and entered its fifth generation in 2019. The Clio has had substantial critical and commercial success, being consistently one of Europe&#x27;s top-selling cars since its launch, and it is largely credited with restoring Renault&#x27;s reputation and stature after a difficult second half of the 1980s. The Clio is one of only two cars, the other being the Volkswagen Golf, to have been voted European Car of the Year twice, in 1991 and 2006.

The car is named after Clio, one of the nine Muses in Greek mythology. In Japan, it is sold as the Renault Lutecia because Honda retains the rights to the name Clio after establishing the &quot;Honda Clio&quot; sales channel in 1984. Lutecia is derived from the name of &quot;Lutetia&quot;, an ancient Roman city that was the predecessor of Paris. The Renault Lutecia was formerly available through Yanase Co., Ltd., but in 1999 Renault purchased a stake in Japanese automaker Nissan. Following Renault&#x27;s takeover, distribution rights for the Lutecia were handed over to Nissan locations in 2000 and sold at &quot;Nissan Red Stage&quot; locations.


== First generation (X57; 1990) ==
Renault had replaced its R5 supermini with a completely redesigned model (which had similar styling to the 1972 original) in 1984, but soon afterwards began working on an all-new supermini to take the company into the 1990s. It was eventually decided that the new car would feature a name designation, rather than the numeric model designations which Renault had traditionally used – this would be adopted across the entire Renault range by 1995. Cars like the Fuego coupe (launched in 1980) had been an exception to this rule, and the last &quot;numeric&quot; Renault was the 19, launched in 1988, and by the end of 1996 the numeric model designations had completely disappeared from the Renault range in Western Europe.

The Clio was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in June 1990 and sales in France and the rest of the continent began then, although sales in right-hand drive Britain did not begin until March 1991. The Clio was the replacement to the hugely successful Renault 5, although this car remained in production until 1996 at a factory in Slovenia, where some versions of the Clio were later built. The Clio&#x27;s suspension and floorpan were largely the same as the R5, which was derived from the R9 saloon of 1981 and R11 hatchback of 1983 – not that of the original 1972 Renault 5, despite the later R5 visually resembling the original model.

The suspension uses half-width torsion bars (full-width on higher spec models) with trailing arms at the rear, and coil sprung MacPherson struts, attached to a thick pressed steel subframe at the front. The engine range available at launch included 1.2 L and 1.4 L E-type &quot;Energy&quot; petrol inline-four engines (first seen in the Renault 19) and 1.7 L and 1.9 L diesel engines, both based on the F-type unit. The petrol engines gradually had their carburettors replaced with electronic fuel injection systems by the end of 1992, in order to conform to ever stricter pollutant emission regulations brought in by the EEC.

A minor trim facelift occurred after only a year of being on sale. A new &quot;smooth&quot; version of the Renault diamond badge (the previous &quot;ribbed&quot; badge was being phased out at the time) and a new front seat design were the only changes. The altered design did not constitute a new &quot;phase&quot;. In March 1994 (at the Geneva Motor Show), the phase two model was launched, with small updates to the exterior and interior of the Clio. Most noticeable was the change in the front grille from two metal ribs to a single colour-coded slat. The bump strips were made slightly larger and rounder and had the car&#x27;s trim level badge incorporated into them. The badges on the tailgate strip were moved up onto the tailgate itself and the tailgate strip was given a carbon fibre look. The rear light clusters were given a slightly more rounded bubble shape, giving the Clio a more modern look. The clusters, however, are physically interchangeable with phase ones&#x27;.

In May 1996, with the arrival of the phase three facelifted Clio, the 1.2 L Energy engine was replaced by the 1,149 cc D7F MPi (multi point injection) DiET engine, first used in the Renault Twingo; for some time also, versions were available with the older 1239 cc &quot;Cléon&quot; unit from the original Twingo. The cylinder head design on the 1.4 L E-type was also slightly altered for the phase three models in a bid for better fuel economy. This resulted in the engines producing slightly less power than their earlier versions.

The phase three Clios have a slightly more noticeable update than the phase twos. The phase three has different, more rounded headlights, incorporating the turn signal in the unit with the headlight, and the bonnet curves more around the edges of the lights. The tailgate incorporates a third brake light and a new script &quot;Clio&quot; name badge, following the same typeface as contemporary Renaults. Some mechanical improvements were also made, as well as the introduction of side impact bars and airbags, which were now common features on mainstream cars across Europe.

Renault also released a hot hatch version of the Clio in 1991. It was aesthetically very similar, but with the addition of a 1.8 L eight-valve engine, side skirts and disc brakes on all wheels. This, with multi-point fuel injection, was badged as the RSi. From 1991 a lighter tuned version of this 1.8 litre engine (with single-point injection) joined the earlier 1.7 used in the very luxurious Baccara version which was sold in some continental European markets. In addition to this reasonably powerful engine, the Baccara has a luxurious interior with much leather and wood, as well as power windows, locks, etc. The Baccara was renamed &quot;Initiale&quot; in 1997, in line with other Renaults, differing from the Baccara mainly in the wheel design.
During 1991, a fuel injected 1.8 L 16-valve engine producing (which had debuted on the Renault 19) capable of propelling the car to was introduced to the Clio engine range, known simply as the Clio 16S in France (S for &quot;soupapes&quot;, the French word for valves), and Clio 16V in export markets. It was the successor to the Renault 5 GT Turbo, which was discontinued that year as the R5 range was pruned back. As well as having a higher top speed than a regular Clio, the 16S sports wider plastic front wings, an offset bonnet vent, wider rear arches and uprated suspension and brakes, and colour-coded front mirrors and bumpers. The RSi side skirts were omitted, however. Inside, the 16V model has an extended instrument panel that houses dials for engine oil pressure, oil temperature, and oil level (which only indicates on engine start). The seats are also more supportive to match the sporting nature of the model. The non-catalyzed versions, still available in some markets, offer and marginally higher performance with top speeds up to and the 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time dropping from 8 to 7.8 seconds.

In December 1990, the Clio was voted European Car of the Year for 1991, and soon became one of Europe&#x27;s best-selling cars, as well as the first Renault to be consistently among the top-10 best sellers in the United Kingdom, where it was selling in excess of 50,000 units a year by 1995. UK sales were helped by a famous television advertising campaign by Publicis shot in France, featuring the two main characters of Papa and Nicole, played by Max Douchin and Estelle Skornik respectively.

From 1991 to 1993, trim levels were identical in every European country. Starting in 1993, trim levels designations became more varied across the various markets. The car was sold as the Renault Lutecia (from &quot;Lutetia&quot;, the Latin name for Paris) in Japan, as &quot;Clio&quot; was used there by Honda for one of their domestic marketing networks.

===Clio Williams===
In 1993, Renault launched the Clio Williams as a limited edition of 3,800 cars (1,300 more than they needed for homologation purposes) with each car bearing a numbered plaque on the dash. These sold out so quickly that Renault ended up building 1,600 more.

After the first series, due to the demand, Renault built the Williams 2 and 3, with more than 12,000 eventually being built. However, many new road cars were directly converted to race cars and when damaged replaced with another converted road car, which means that the actual number of road cars is significantly lower than the figures suggest.

The car was named after the then Renault-powered Formula One team WilliamsF1, though Williams had nothing to do with the design or engineering of this Clio. The modifications to the Clio 16S on which it was based were the work of Renault Sport, Renault&#x27;s motorsport division. Nevertheless, this car had a Formula One link by being the sport&#x27;s Safety Car in 1996.

The naturally aspirated DOHC 4 valves per cylinder fed by Multipoint fuel injection Inline-four engine, was rated at at 6,100 rpm and at 4,500 rpm of torque. It has a top speed of equipped with performance-tuned ride and handling. Renault later released the Williams 2 and Williams 3 special editions, much to the chagrin of those owners who had been assured of the exclusivity of the &quot;original&quot; Williams. One common mistake people can make is thinking that the 2.0 16V (F7R) used in the Williams is simply a bored out 1.8 16V (F7P), whereas, in reality the large engine had different size valves, cams, stroked crank and engine oil cooler. Other differences between the Williams and the Clio 16S it is based on include a wider front track with wishbones similar, but not the same as the Renault 19, wider Speedline alloys, uprated (JC5) gearbox, bespoke four-to-one manifold, firmer suspension, and some cosmetic differences on the exterior and interior.

The differences between the three versions of the Williams were largely a reflection of phase changes across the Clio range, e.g. the gradual addition of enhanced safety features and cosmetic variations. Other than this, the Williams 1 and 2 had no sunroof and were painted in 449 Sports Blue. The final Williams 3 was painted in a slightly brighter shade of blue (432 Monaco Blue) and finally gained a sunroof which had long been standard on virtually all previous Clios. The original Williams was the lightest of the three, lacking the electrics necessary for the sunroof or the mirrors, and was the only one to support a metal plaque stating the build number.

The Renault Clio Williams was and still is a very popular rally car. The basic racing version (Gr.N) had racing suspension, different engine management, and a more free flowing exhaust. Power output was around . Roll cage was made by Matter France. Bucket seats were made by Sabelt.

The next step up was the Gr.A car, which was fitted with 16″ Speedline 2012 rims (with optional extractors), further improvements on suspension and a more tuned engine producing between . Front brakes were also updated with 323 mm discs and four-pot Alcon brake calipers.

The final evolution was the Renault Clio Williams Maxi kit-car with wider arches and 17″ Speedline 2012 rims and improved Proflex suspension. The Sodemo engine was further tuned to .

== Second generation (X65; 1998) ==

Development of the X65 commenced in 1991, a year after the May 1990 launch of the Clio. In 1992, Pierre Beuzit became project manager of the X65 programme. In December 1993, a final design developed under Patrick Le Quément was approved, with development for production commencing, so in 1994 Renault rented a 129,600-square-foot building in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, west of Paris. More than 600 people from Renault and its suppliers went to work there. The X65 project team became a laboratory for Renault&#x27;s Guyancourt technical center. Forty teams were created, each responsible for a section of the car. In February 1997, management moved market launch by nearly a month from 15 March 1998 to 11 April 1998. Development ended in 1997, as pre-production units began to be constructed at Flins.

The second generation of the Clio was launched on 9 March 1998 and sold for less than €8,000, with considerably more rounded and bulbous styling than its predecessor. Part of the radical concept of the new Clio were many components made of unusual materials to save in weight and repair costs. For instance, the front wings were made of plastic (following criticisms of corrosion in this part of the previous model and based on technology developed for the Renault Espace) and the material of the bonnet was aluminium in some versions. Originally the engine lineup was similar to before, with 1.2 L, 1.4 L and 1.6 L petrol engines and a 1.9 L diesel. The project manager from 1992 to 1998 for the Clio II was Pierre Beuzit.

In 1998, Renault launched the Clio Renault Sport (also known as Clio R.S. for short), with a 2.0 L 16-valve engine and a top speed of . This was named the Clio Renault Sport 172 in the UK – 172 coming from the DIN method metric horsepower measurement. The standard Clio RTE powered with by the 1.2 engine could reach 160 km/h. The top-of-the-range Clio, however, was the 2001 mid-engined, rear-wheel drive Clio V6 Renault Sport, originally engineered by Tom Walkinshaw Racing for a one-make racing series, which placed a 3.0 L V6 engine, sourced from the Renault Laguna, behind the front seats, with a top speed of . Production was at the TWR factory in Sweden. Clio V6 production over three years was approximately 1513 vehicles with 256 sold in the UK.

=== The Clio Sport collection ===
In early 2000, two new vehicle models were released - A version equipped with a new 1.6 L 16-valve engine, along with a refined 1.9 L 8-valve turbo-diesel. 

Following the Release of these two new engines, Renault gathered together what they called the Clio Sport collection, a lineup of performance oriented models to offer a variety of features for different drivers. 

The collection included the base model &quot;Clio sport&quot;, The Clio Si (Standing for sports injection), The Clio RSI (Renault sports injection) and the RenaultSport 172. 

Whilst the 172 became the flagship performance model under RenaultSport, the Si and RSI were much lesser-known variants aimed at offering sporty styling and enhanced features at a more accessible price point. The RSI was powered by the before-mentioned new 1.6 16v engine, and offered sportier performance than the standard Clio 2 Phase 1 of the time. It featured body colored bumpers, white instrument dials and alloy wheels, on top of all other standard and options that the highest trim Clio&#x27;s came with. The Clio Si, whilst being less powerful with the new 1.9dTi diesel engine, also carried all of the sporty design clues as the RSI did but with the addition of bucket seats in the front, and an electric back tilt sunroof. 

Both models today are considered rare, with the Si spec being exceptionally rare. Unlike the RSI, which benefitted from the brand new high revving 1.6 16V engine, the Si occupied an extremely unusual position in the lineup - It combined the styling an features of a performance model whilst using a diesel powertrain - a choice which was uncommon at the time as diesels were known for economy, not performance. As a result, the Si saw extremely limited production (under 8,000 units globally) which lasted just over 1 year before being pulled off the market entirely.

Both of these models came with ABS, alloy wheels, both driver and passenger airbags, 60w RDS radios, rear spoilers and heat reflecting windscreens as standard options. 

The Si at release cost £10715, and the RSI £11815. Compared to the 172&#x27;s price of £15,995 - both models offered a sportier experience at a much more accessible price point. 

After this time, all the older petrol engines were upgraded to more powerful and more economical 16-valve versions.

Later on in 2000, a few minor changes were made to the Clio range, which included revised specification levels, a new instrument cluster, and a passenger airbag fitted as standard for all models. The Clio achieved a four-star Euro NCAP rating in 2000, which was class-leading at the time.

In Japan, Renault was formerly licensed by Yanase Co., Ltd., but in 1999, Renault purchased a stake in Japanese automaker Nissan after Nissan had faced financial troubles following the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in 1991 and subsequent Lost Decade. As a result of Renault&#x27;s purchase of interest, Yanase canceled its licensing contract with Renault in the spring of 2000, and Nissan took over as the sole licensee, hence sales of the Lutecia II in Japan were transferred from &quot;Yanase Store&quot; locations to &quot;Nissan Red Stage Store&quot; locations.

=== The Clio Freeway collection ===
Following the release of the Clio sport collection, the Clio Freeway collection was launched - it was the entry level collection of the Clio 2 in 2000, and It consisted of the base model Clio Liberte, Clio Grande, and the Clio MTV. This collection was aimed at the much more casual driver, who valued a car to get them from point A to B and nothing more. 

The Clio Liberte started at a price of £7,995 and featured a driver and passenger airbag as standard, with no other options available. The Clio Grande started at £8,295 but came with power steering, central locking, a sunroof and 60w RDS radio as standard on top of all Liberte features. The flagship of the Freeway collection was the Clio MTV, a special edition of the Renault Clio, created in collaboration with MTV, the popular music television network. This limited-edition model was aimed at younger drivers and featured unique styling and entertainment-focused features such as an MTV themed interior, MTV badging, a 64W radio system with 6 speakers as standard, and all other &quot;medium&quot; trim options offered around this time. The Clio MTV cot £8,495 at launch.

=== The Clio Elegance collection ===
The Clio Elegance Collection represented a premium line of trims designed to offer features typically found in more expensive executive cars. There were 3 models in the collection, the Clio Alize which cost £10,150 at launch, the Clio Etoile at £11,050 and the Clio Initiale at £13,150. All three included options like air conditioning, leather upholstery, power steering, electric front windows, and advanced audio systems. The Initiale trim, positioned as the flagship, featured luxury touches such as wood-effect trims and leather steering wheels. This collection was particularly popular for those seeking compact luxury, competing directly with the more youthful Sport Collection and the entry-level Freeway Collection, which focused on performance and affordability, respectively. The Elegance Collection&#x27;s blend of comfort and refinement contributed to its strong sales and appeal.

=== Electric Clio ===
An electric version of the Clio was developed by Renault for an electric carshare project in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines in 1998. Fifty cars were produced, and could be charged by plugging in or by an induction pad located in some of the town&#x27;s special locations. The electric Clio had a claimed top speed of 60 mph and a range of 35–40 miles. The scheme was branded Praxitèle and membership was charged at £10/month and around £3 for a 30-minute trip.

===Phase 2===
A major facelift occurred in June 2001 (Phase 2) which saw the exterior restyled (most visibly the headlights were made more angular), the interior quality improved with a new dashboard and centre console including the availability of digital climate control air-conditioning and satellite navigation on top models and a 1.5 L common rail Diesel engine added.
====2003====
Major revisions were made to the mid-engine 3.0 litre V6 model in line with the facelift introduced to the regular models in 2001 including revised frontal styling, new dashboard and higher equipment levels including climate control, cruise control and xenon headlights. The power output of the engine was raised by to , giving it a top speed of and a 0–62 mph (100 km/h) time of 5.8 seconds. Emissions are 285g/km and meet Euro IV standards 2 years before the implementation deadline. The chassis was also significantly revised with a slightly longer wheelbase and revised suspension together with larger 18 inch alloy wheels. For the Phase 2 V6, production was transferred from TWR&#x27;s Swedish factory to the dedicated Renault Sport Alpine factory at Dieppe in Northern France. Production from 2003 to the end of 2005 was approximately 1309 vehicles of which 354 were sold in the UK.

On ordinary cars, an interior equipment specification change was made from this model year – fitment of a CD player as standard (as opposed to cassette) on Expression and Dynamique. It remained optional on Authentique and its Rush derivative.

===Phase 3===
In 2004, Phase 3 followed starting on a 53 Plate, this was just some small changes to bring it up to date. The front bumper was changed giving it a wide lower grille and the foglights were bulged out at the side (cars not equipped with foglights remained using the older ph2 bumper), the upper grille was changed and the headlights (which previously had black background) now had grey. The 15&quot; alloy wheels were changed and were now a 15&quot; version of the facelift 172 model on Dynamique and Extreme models. Clear side repeaters were added, as was a colourcoded rear spoiler (again on Dynamique spec cars). In the South American market, the facelifted Clio continued to use the dashboard of the 1998 model and was never updated, except for the Colombian 2008 model that included the same interior of the European version with little changes, and continued having the same exterior as the phase II model.

On the inside the pattern on the seats was changed for a simpler one, and the dials were changed to do away with the fuel and water temperature needles and now featured a larger screen that included a digital version of these gauges as well as the mileage and trip computer. Climate control equipped cars were given a vent in the back of the glove box so it could be climate controlled. Under the bonnet a new dCi engine was available (the 1.2 16v also received a new engine developed with Nissan). Rear disks were fitted on 1.6 16v models and DCi 100 models equipped with ESP. On this second facelift, the Clio Renault Sport&#x27;s power was improved to (in the UK, the designation R.S. 182 was adopted). For the first time there were two options in chassis stiffness for the R.S. model. the standard Settings (different from the non-sport models), and CUP badge chassis, 20 mm lower, larger stabilizer bars, and stiffer suspension with dark graphite alloy wheels.

At the 2006 Paris International Agricultural Show, Renault exhibited a Hi-Flex Clio II with a 1.6 L 16-valve engine. This vehicle, which addresses the Brazilian market, features Renault-developed flex-fuel technology, with a highly versatile engine that can run on fuel containing a blend of petrol and ethanol in any proportion (0% to 100% of either).

===Phase 4 / 5===
The Phase 4 Clio II, known as the Clio Campus, was introduced in 2006 and had a restyled rear end, the number plate moving from boot to bumper, and a better specification on all models. This car stopped being sold in the UK in late 2008, and a revised front end was then released in April 2009 (Phase 5).
The last units of the Clio II built in Mexico featured the headlights used on the Nissan Platina, thus becoming the third headlight design to be used in the car. This version lasted a month (January 2010) on sale, before both the Clio and Platina being replaced by the Logan and Sandero due to quality issues. The second generation Clio was marketed until 2012 in France as the Clio Campus, or in Slovenia as the Clio Storia. It is still marketed in Colombia also as Clio Campus since 2012, with the same interior as the pre-facelifted model and a very basic equipment, without airbags or foglights.
===Phase 6===

In October 2012, a new version of the Clio II, called Clio Mío, was introduced at the São Paulo Motor Show, featuring the brand&#x27;s new design theme. Intended to be the lowest priced Renault model available in Latin America, it was manufactured in Córdoba, Argentina, and featured additional styling and equipment updates. It kept the dashboard of the pre-facelift version, but with new gauges and optional colour matching inserts.

As of 2015, it contained about 40% Argentine parts.

The Phase 6 Clio II was also offered in Maghreb, where it kept the name Clio Campus. It was finally retired from production in October 2016.
====Safety====
The Clio Mío in its most basic version for Latin America with no airbags received 0 stars for adult occupants and 1 star for infants from Latin NCAP in 2013.
===Sedan===

In 1999, Renault launched the saloon version of the Clio II, named Clio Symbol in Turkey and Eastern Europe, Thalia in Central Europe, Clio Classic in Asia and North Africa, Clio Sedan in Brazil and Paraguay, or Symbol in the rest of South America (except Argentina where it was called Clio). The car was intended for sale in developing countries, where saloons were traditionally preferred over hatchbacks, most notably in Eastern Europe, where the Thalia was cheaper than the Clio, but was still about 30% more expensive than the Dacia Logan, also sold by Renault as a low cost model. In some Latin American markets the sedan was offered as the Nissan Platina (manufactured in Aguascalientes, Mexico), with slight changes in the front of the car to make it resemble the Nissan Altima. The sedan version of the Clio was facelifted in 2002, with new exterior similar to the facelifted Clio, better equipment and safety levels.

In the fall of 2006, an improved Clio sedan has been offered, renamed in Eastern Europe as Renault Symbol. This model featured the interior of the facelifted Clio II with very minor parts commonality with Megane II, as well as new standard and optional equipment, such as automatic air conditioning and a CD player. The model earned moderate reception in the domestic market.

Renault introduced the second generation of the Symbol model at the 2008 Moscow Motor Show. This new model featured chrome-trimmed front grille and rear fascia, while powered by similar engines as the Dacia Logan range. It was designed for the Eastern and Central Europe, Russia, Turkey and North Africa, and it was also manufactured in Argentina for South America.

===&quot;Watchdog&quot; controversy===
In April 2006, the BBC&#x27;s consumer affairs programme &quot;Watchdog&quot; aired details of over 1,000 incidents involving Clio IIs in which the bonnet flew open without warning while still being driven, usually at high speeds, and sometimes writing the cars off. The problem was found to be caused by the catch not being cleaned and lubricated during servicing causing it to stick in the open position. Renault investigated the issue with the aid of the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) and a &quot;task force&quot; of Renault departments to test the design but found no problem with the bonnet catch and so would not issue a recall. Renault instead wrote to owners of the model and offered to &quot;remedy for free any catches where there has been poor maintenance&quot;.

&quot;Watchdog&quot; has since claimed other experts have contacted them with accusations that Renault was expecting people to maintain a flawed part that would corrode over time and could cost lives. David Burrowes, MP, Chair of the Government&#x27;s Road Safety Group, later tabled a motion in the House of Commons urging further action. Renault was accused by its Press Relations Manager Graeme Holt, who quit in protest, of downplaying the serious &quot;fault&quot; and putting customers&#x27; lives in danger.

== Third generation (X85; 2005) ==

The third generation Clio was unveiled at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show.

The Clio III uses the Nissan B platform, co-developed with Nissan (which Renault has a share in), that is shared with the Renault Modus, the Nissan Micra, and the Nissan Note. It is considerably larger and heavier as well as being more expensive than the Clio II and, at nearly in length, has almost outgrown the supermini class.

This was the result of a decision to move the Clio upmarket. It also brings the trademark &quot;Renault Card&quot; keyless immobiliser to the Clio for the first time. The Clio III achieved a 5-star EuroNCAP safety rating. Sales began throughout Europe in October 2005.

Clio came with several trims, with the Dynamique having the most variations as it comes with 4 versions, namely the Dynamique, Dynamique S, Dynamique SX and Dynamique TomTom. The Clio Dynamique S comes with 4-wheel disc brakes and 16-inch alloys. Several options were offered, with others that could be added later on, like a sport exhaust made by Sebring, or rear &quot;becquet&quot; (spoiler), to provide a sporty look.

It was voted European Car of the Year 2006, becoming the first car to win twice, defeating the rival Volkswagen Passat by just 5 points. The Clio was described by several people as the new benchmark for its category and by one judge as a &quot;great little car that should inspire bigger ones&quot;. The trophy for the award was presented in January 2006 to the Renault chief executive at a ceremony in Italy organized by &quot;Auto Magazine&quot;.

In June 2006 the sales of the third generation Clio Renault Sport started in France for the price of €23,000. The Clio Renault Sport is equipped with a new naturally aspirated 16-valve 2.0 L engine based on the earlier version used in the second generation Clio Renault Sport and a 6-speed manual gearbox. The engine develops at 7250 rpm. The top speed is and 0–100 km/h (62 mph) takes 6.9 seconds.

An estate version called Sport Tourer in the UK was unveiled in March 2007. All Clio Estates were built in Turkey by Oyak-Renault. The Clio Estate was nearly as long as the contemporary Mégane Estate, and at , the cargo space was larger than the of the Mégane. At the same time, Renault replaced the 1.4 L atmospheric engine with a new turbocharged 1.2 TCe version, with and of torque. In the 2nd, 3rd and 4th gears over 4500 rpm the turbocharger adds 5 extra HP.

Unlike its predecessors, the Japanese-spec Renault Lutecia III was not available at any Yanase Co., Ltd. dealership location, as Yanase had ended its import rights for Renault after Renault had acquired a stake in Nissan when the Lutecia II was still in production. Instead, the Renault Lutecia III was sold exclusively through &quot;Nissan Red Stage Store&quot; locations.
===Facelift===
==== 2009 ====
A facelifted version of the Clio III went on sale in the United Kingdom on 15 May 2009.

It features better quality materials used in the interior and is better equipped than the pre-facelift model.

It is also introduced with a new &quot;Clio R.S.&quot; variant, intended to slot between the regular Clio and the &quot;Clio 182 R.S.&quot;.

The &quot;Clio GT&quot; has a new aggressive front end styling incorporating a black grille, extended side sills, suspension settings unique to the &quot;R.S.&quot; variant, and a twin tailpipe design with a lip spoiler on the rear end.

The Renault Clio III also became the basis for the Renault Clio Gordini 20–34 (limited edition) introduced in the United Kingdom in 2010. The Clio Gordini 200 is equipped with a 2.0L F4R engine which develops . However, the limited edition is priced as low as the usual version.

The range was reduced in late 2012, due to the launch of the Clio IV. However, in France and Spain it remained in the range as the Clio Collection and was in production until 2014.
===Engines===
== Fourth generation (X98; 2012) ==

The Clio IV was introduced at the September–October 2012 Paris Motor Show, and began marketing a month later. It is available in hatchback body style and starting from early 2013 also as an estate. It is manufactured in Flins, France, and in Bursa, Turkey (main production site), where the estate will particularly be assembled.

The Clio IV is only available with five doors, with &quot;hidden&quot; rear door handles near the windows. Another notable difference from the previous generation is the wheelbase, which has been significantly extended and is now near to the one of a compact car. The length and the width have also been increased, but less significantly.

The R.S. version was launched in Mexico in 2014, and was the only French-made product in Renault&#x27;s Mexican lineup.

===Clio R.S.===
Revealed at the 2012 Paris Motor Show, the fourth-generation model eliminates manual transmission in favor of a 6-speed EDC dual-clutch transmission (Efficient Double Clutch) developed by Renault Sport engineers. The new model now comes with a DIG-T Nissan MR16DDT inline-four engine, which develops and of torque. It is available exclusively as a five-door model for the first time.

In 2016 Renault released a face-lifted version featuring new LED headlights and other minor improvements. There&#x27;s also a Trophy version that has an improved engine that produces and In 2018, Renault released a limited edition R.S. 18. This model is only available in black with livery inspired by the colour scheme of the company&#x27;s Formula 1 race car.

===Features===
The Clio IV features new equipment such as hands-free, rear camera connectivity with more than 50 applications (Renault R-Link 7-inch infotainment system, powered by Android &amp; TomTom) and a six-speed dual-clutch transmission that will be available starting early 2013.

===Engines===
The range of petrol engines consists of three options: a 1.2-litre 16 valve straight-four engine, with a maximum power output of , a turbocharged 0.9-litre 12 valve straight-3 engine, developing , which can have a emission level of 99 g/km and a 1.2 litre turbocharged engine which produces . A turbocharged 1.6-litre four-cylinder engine, capable of producing , will be featured on the Renault Sport version.

The diesel range has two versions of the 1.5 dCi straight-4 engine, one of and one of , which can have a emission level of 83 g/km.


===Facelift===
==== Phase 2 ====
In August 2016, the Phase 2 was launched. This introduced a mild cosmetic refresh including new LED headlights and tail lights (standard on high spec models and optional on mid spec), restyled front and rear bumpers, new alloy wheel designs, LED front fog lights and a new front grille. Inside, the Clio received a new steering wheel, updated versions of the MediaNav and R-Link systems (including the addition of DAB digital radio), new interior door panels including a new 4-way mirror adjustment control (the first time this saw a new design since Clio II), and a new gear knob.

In 2018, the Clio IV range for the UK market was significantly condensed. The trim levels were reduced to: Play, Iconic and GT-Line. The 1.6-litre R.S. model was dropped from the lineup, as were both 1.2-litre petrol engines and the 110 hp diesel. This left the engine range at the 0.9 TCe petrol engine available with either 75 hp or 90 hp, and the 1.5 dCi 90 hp diesel.

In France, despite being replaced by the fifth generation in 2019, the Clio IV (marketed as Renault Clio Génération) remained on offer until August 2020. It was still manufactured in Turkey for some markets until May 2021. After this date, the Clio IV only stays assembled in Algeria for the domestic market.
==Fifth generation (BJA; 2019)==
The fifth generation model was unveiled at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show. It was originally planned to be unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show, but it was later delayed. It is the first model to use the CMF-B HS platform, shared with the second-generation Renault Captur and Nissan Juke among others.

The fifth generation features an interior that uses higher quality materials and finishes (for higher trim levels) than the previous one, sporty seats and a redesigned, more compact steering wheel.

On higher trim levels it can be equipped with a 9.3-inch touchscreen (with Easy Link system, compatible with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and equipped with Google Maps and TomTom navigation), customizable instrument cluster that uses a TFT LCD, an electric parking brake, a wireless smartphone charger, hands-free parking, a 360-degree system with four cameras, lane keeping assistant, adaptive cruise control and recognition of road signs, blind spot warning and automatic emergency braking.

===Facelift===
On April 18, 2023, a significant facelift debuted, featuring a completely redesigned front bumper with slimmer headlights and a wider checkerboard grille. The R.S. Line trim level was replaced with the Esprit Alpine trim level.

In 2024, the Clio received an updated steering wheel with a new logo, taken from the Symbioz. 

The Mitsubishi Colt was introduced on June 8, 2023 as a rebadged version of the facelifted Clio, and it features a hybrid powertrain option.

===Powertrain===
The CMF-B modular platform enables improved efficiency and offers the option of a hybrid powertrain for the first time. Available from 2020, the E-Tech hybrid drivetrain combines a new generation 1.6 liter petrol engine with two electric motors, a multi-mode gearbox and a 1.2 kWh battery.

The range of conventional engines includes new turbo petrol engines (1.0 TCe 100 and 1.3 TCe 130), along with the naturally aspirated 1.0 SCe, as well as the 1.5 liter Blue dCi diesel with an output of . In total, customers can choose from nine engine/gearbox combinations.

==Advertising==
* In the United Kingdom, the Clio was advertised on television using the characters &quot;Nicole&quot; (a flirtatious young French woman played by Estelle Skornik) and &quot;Papa&quot; (her somewhat slow-witted father played by Max Douchin). The 1994 advert featured Vincent Cassel as Nicole&#x27;s boyfriend. The commercials were very popular, with the final instalment of the series featuring comedy double act Bob Mortimer and Vic Reeves, in a sequence parodying &quot;The Graduate&quot;. In 2000, the 1991 commercial &quot;Interesting&quot; was named the 12th best television commercial of all time, in a poll conducted by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and Channel 4. Sound clips of the advert were played repeatedly on &quot;The Chris Moyles Show&quot; when it was discovered Comedy Dave and his girlfriend had named their newborn daughter Nicole.
* In 1999, a television advert was launched worldwide for the Renault Clio MTV Limited edition featuring a man who was saying &quot;Get up ah!&quot; all the time, it was actually the only sound he can hear from a Clio passing in front of his house early in the morning, then the advert shows the five men inside the Clio and moving their heads to the rhythm of the James Brown song &quot;Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine&quot;. Same advertising made in Argentina with the Clio II in 2000 with this song.
* The Clio II advertising campaign featured French model Hélène Mahieu, and French international footballer Thierry Henry for the Clio II facelift, both attempting to define the term &quot;va-va-voom&quot;, a term later defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as &quot;The quality of being exciting, vigorous, or sexually attractive&quot;, although they state that it dates from the 1950s. In Brazil, the Clio had a trim level called Va Va Voom. The trim level has been discontinued. In Mexico, The Clio II&#x27;s latest campaign reads &quot;todo por mi Clio&quot; (&quot;anything for my Clio&quot;), depicting one would give anything to keep one&#x27;s Clio safe from danger.
* An advertising campaign for the Renault Clio III featured French actress Annelise Hesme and English actor Jeremy Sheffield as Sophie and Ben (respectively), trying to outdo each other over the superiority of each nation via a range of cultural aspects. This &quot;France Vs Britain&quot; (French car, British designers) campaign has been extended across a number of media, for example the &quot;French Film, British Cinemas&quot; tag for the annual Renault French Film Festival. The music used is Nina Simone&#x27;s &quot;Sinnerman&quot;.

==Motorsport==
The Clio has competed in various well-known races and championships such as the Spa 24 hours and British GT. The car competed in the Spa 24 hour race in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1999 and 2000. Atlanta Motorsport competed in the GT Cup class in 2003 and 2004, both times at Donington Park. The Clio has also been entered in the Nürburgring 24 Hours and Zolder 24 Hours with varying amounts of success.

In 2001, Rob Collard entered the BTCC with a Renault Clio in the Production class, which were made up of slower, smaller cars like the Peugeot 306 GTi, the Ford Focus and Honda Accord. Throughout the season, Collard was a common contender in the middle of the field in most races. He was often seen amongst the lower-scoring Peugeot 306s like Tom Boardman and Paul O&#x27;Neill. At the end of the season, despite not participating in nine races and getting only eight finishes, initially, he finished 12th with 51 points, but due to a penalty of 5 points, his final position in the championship standings was 13th with 46 points. He scored one podium in the first race at Snetterton, with a 5th-place finish.

In 2002, Collard entered again with the Clio for the next season. Unfortunately, out of the ten races he was entered in, he only started four, with the three he finished resulted in him ending up on the podium with a 2nd place in class (7th overall) and a 1st place in class (9th overall) at the first event of the season. After four non-starts at Oulton Park and Thruxton, Collard finished 2nd in class (14th overall) at Silverstone in the first race, later retiring from the second. His last entry in the Clio was at Croft where he didn&#x27;t start either race. By the end of the season, he initially had 39 points, but 5 were redacted, he remained in his 12th-place finish in the championship standings with 34 points.

===Rallying===

Versions of the mark-five Clio, the Renault Clio Rally4 and the Renault Clio Rally5, have been produced by Renault Sport for the Rally4 and Rally5 tiers of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile&#x27;s Rally Pyramid. Both are wider than their consumer counterpart, which is taller than the rally versions. Both are two-wheel drive, and have a front-axle track of .
A rallycross variant also exists.

<doc id="543412" wikidata="Q602783" url="?curid=543412" title="Ocho Rios">
<text>Ocho Rios (Spanish for &quot;Eight Rivers&quot;) is a town in the parish of Saint Ann on the north coast of Jamaica, and is more widely referred to as &quot;Ochi&quot; by locals. Beginning as a sleepy fishing village, Ocho Rios has seen explosive growth in recent decades to become a popular tourist destination featuring duty-free shopping, a cruise-ship terminal, tourist attractions and several beaches and acclaimed resorts. In addition to being a port of call for cruise ships, Ocho Rios also hosts cargo ships at the Reynolds Pier for the exportation of sugar, limestone, and in the past, bauxite. The estimated population of the town in 2011 was 16,671, which is nearly 10% of the total population of St. Ann. The town is served by both Sangster International Airport (97 km west of Ocho Rios) and Ian Fleming International Airport (17 km east of Ocho Rios). Scuba diving and other water sports are offered in the town&#x27;s vicinity.

The name &quot;Ocho Rios&quot; is a possible misnomer, as there are not eight rivers in the area. It could be a British corruption of the original Spanish name &quot;Las Chorreras&quot; (&quot;the waterfalls&quot;), a name given to the village because of the nearby Dunn&#x27;s River Falls.

== Tourism ==
In 2008, the attraction Mystic Mountain opened with a bobsled experience inspired by the Jamaican bobsled team that participated in the 1988 Olympics in Calgary. The attraction received a $570-million upgrade in 2019.

The North Coast Highway from Sangster International Airport at Montego Bay to Ocho Rios has been improved since 2007 and the journey has dropped to an hour and 45 minutes drive. On 26 August 2011, the Jamaican government announced a $21 million revitalization plan for the resort area. Since March 2016, with the opening of the North-South portion of Highway 2000 (whose North terminus is located at Mammee Bay, a suburb of Ocho Rios), driving and commute times into the nation&#x27;s capital, Kingston, have gone from over 2 hours to a little under an hour. The opening of this highway has reduced traffic on the old route between Jamaica&#x27;s two cities (through the town and onto Fern Gully) immensely.

The town has several popular restaurants and nightclubs, such as Margaritaville, as well as Dolphin Cove, where tourists can swim and interact with dolphins. Another major point of interest is Fern Gully, which was formed from a 1907 earthquake that destroyed one of the river beds in the area. Fern Gully stretches about of great rocky gorge where travellers can see over 540 variety of ferns. In 1907, the British government paved over the destroyed river bed to create what is known as The Fern Gully Highway.

==History==
Ocho Rios was originally settled by a tribe of Arawak called Taíno, who had settled in Jamaica around 1,000 BCE and called the land Xamayca, meaning land of wood and water. After Christopher Columbus landed in 1494 and claimed the island for Spain, Ocho Rios was named Las Chorreras, meaning rapid rivers. The Taínos were ultimately obliterated by disease, slavery, and war. Some also committed suicide, presumably to escape their conditions as slaves. Spain brought the first enslaved Africans to Jamaica in 1517, to work on plantations throughout Jamaica, including Ocho Rios.

In May 1655, British forces seized the island from the Spanish. The English misunderstood, misinterpreted, and mispronounced the Spanish name Chorreras and called the town Ocho Rios, which sounded close enough. In 1657 and 1658 the Spanish, sailing from Cuba, failed to retake the island in fierce battles in and around Ocho Rios known as the Battle of Las Chorreras. 

Historically, Ocho Rios did not have any prominent role to either the English or the Spanish. It was, however, utilised by pirates who along with Port Royal, regarded it as a perfect base of operations.
When slavery was officially abolished on Jamaica in the year of 1834, the town entered a period of poverty and rebirth. With colonial interests removed, the history of Ocho Rios was crafted by the newly-freed slaves, who embraced their new-found freedom and slowly turned the town into a stable and peaceful fishing village.

Although plantations developed during colonial times, Ocho Rios never evolved as a fruit-shipping port of any consequence. Things began to change in the 1940s when Reynolds Jamaica Mines built the deep-water Reynolds Pier west of town. An overhead conveyor belt exists 10 km from the Reynolds open-cast mines at Lydford, in the hills south of town.

Nonetheless, Ocho Rios was still just a quiet village in the 1960s, when the Jamaican government formed the St Ann Development Company (SADCo), under the direction of the Urban Development Corporation (UDC), and then began systematic development. It dredged the harbor and built a small marina, reclaimed the shore, brought in sand for Turtle Beach, and built shopping and housing complexes. 

In January and February 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. stayed in Ocho Rios, with wife Coretta and two employees, to draft his fourth and final book, &quot;Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?&quot;.
By the early 1980s, Ocho Rios&#x27; character had been established: a meld of American-style fast-food franchises, nondescript shopping malls, an enclave of small hotels in town, and more upscale hotels a discrete distance east. The construction of Island Village, a major shopping and entertainment complex, has spruced up &#x27;Ochi.&#x27; In 1968, the Jamaica Villa Association (JAVA) was created to represent the growing number of villas in Jamaica. Ocho Rios has seen the rise of luxury villas, with beachfront, ocean, and mountain views.

Today, Ocho Rios extends between Dunn&#x27;s River Falls, to the west of the town centre, and the White River, to the east. Almost all the development outside the centre is to the east.

==In popular culture==
The town was a shooting location during the filming of &quot;Dr. No&quot;, the first James Bond film, released in 1962. The Sans Souci hotel was used as the exterior of the Blue Mountain cottage, the home of Bond villain Miss Taro. A decade later, the town was used again in a Bond film in 1973&#x27;s &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. 

James Cameron&#x27;s first film, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Piranha II: The Spawning&quot;, was filmed at the Mallards Beach-Hyatt Hotel in Ocho Rios, which doubled for the film&#x27;s Club Elysium.

<doc id="543415" wikidata="Q2107839" url="?curid=543415" title="Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)">
<text>Dennis the Menace is an American sitcom based on the Hank Ketcham comic strip of the same name. It preceded &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on Sunday evenings on CBS from October 4, 1959, to July 7, 1963. The series stars Jay North as Dennis Mitchell; Herbert Anderson as his father, Henry; Gloria Henry as his mother, Alice; Joseph Kearns as George Wilson; Gale Gordon as George&#x27;s brother, John Wilson; Sylvia Field as George&#x27;s wife, Martha Wilson; and Sara Seegar as John&#x27;s wife, Eloise Wilson.

Originally sponsored by Kellogg&#x27;s cereals and Best Foods (Skippy peanut butter), the series was produced by Dariell Productions and Screen Gems.

==Plot==
The show follows the Mitchell family – Henry, Alice, and their only child, Dennis, an energetic, trouble-prone, mischievous, but well-meaning boy, who often tangles first with his peace-and-quiet-loving neighbor, George Wilson, a retired salesman, and later with George&#x27;s brother John, a writer. Dennis is basically a good, well-intentioned boy who always tries to help people, but winds up making situations worse. Mr. Wilson has a love-hate relationship toward Dennis who did not realize the aggravation that he would cause. He called Mr. Wilson his &quot;best friend&quot; or &quot;Good Ol&#x27; Mr. Wilson&quot;.

==History==
With CBS seeking to replace the hit show it had lost when it allowed &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; to migrate to ABC, a pilot episode titled &quot;Dennis Goes to the Movies&quot; was filmed in late 1958.

In early 1959, CBS consented to air the program at 7:30 pm EST on Sunday evenings after &quot;Lassie&quot;. After viewing these episodes, CBS determined that Dennis&#x27; antics had to be toned down lest his actions would encourage children watching the show to imitate Dennis.


On February 17, 1962, after filming the show&#x27;s 100th episode, Joseph Kearns died of a cerebral hemorrhage. In a 2010 interview, actress Gloria Henry revealed Kearns followed a strict six-week Metrecal diet that may have contributed to his death. The following two episodes were filmed without the character of Mr. Wilson.

Gale Gordon joined the cast for the last six episodes of the season as Mr. Wilson&#x27;s brother John. It was explained that John was staying as a guest while George was settling an estate. Sylvia Field, who played Martha Wilson, was let go at the end of the season. In the fourth and final season, John Wilson purchased the house from his brother, although where George and Martha had moved was never explained. He was joined by his wife Eloise, played by Sara Seegar. Final references to George and Martha Wilson were made early in the fourth season, although they were not mentioned by name after the first episode. George Wilson was referred to as &quot;the other Mr. Wilson&quot; in the second episode, and John Wilson says in the seventh episode that he bought the house from his brother. After that, the original Wilsons were never mentioned again.

By the end of the show&#x27;s fourth season, Jay North was nearly 12 years old and was outgrowing the antics associated with his character. CBS canceled &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; in early 1963.

===Syndication===
In 1963, NBC began airing reruns of the series on Saturday mornings for two seasons – the show entered syndication in 1965. It has run consistently on local stations over subsequent years. On July 1, 1985, the Nickelodeon cable network began airing the series, and continued until October 22, 1994, after Nick Jr. It also aired on TV Land from 2002 to 2003. On January 3, 2011, &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; began airing on Antenna TV.

The show was exported to the United Kingdom and shown on the ITV network, with 103 episodes airing in the London region between 1960 and 1966. To avoid confusion with the British comic character, the series was known in the UK as &quot;Just Dennis&quot;.

<doc id="543420" wikidata="Q370046" url="?curid=543420" title="Hugh Everett III">
<text>Hugh Everett III (; November 11, 1930 – July 19, 1982) was an American physicist who, in his 1957 PhD thesis, proposed relative state interpretation of quantum mechanics. This influential approach later became the basis of the many-worlds interpretation (MWI). Everett&#x27;s theory dropped the wave function collapse postulate of quantum measurement theory, incorporating the observer in the same quantum state as the observation result. The quantum statistic becomes a measure of the branching of the universal wave function. After his PhD, Everett helped found small companies specializing in contracts with the US government.

Although largely disregarded until near the end of his lifetime, Everett&#x27;s work received more credibility with the discovery of quantum decoherence in the 1970s and has received increased attention in recent decades, with MWI becoming one of the important interpretations of quantum mechanics.

== Early life and education ==
Hugh Everett III was born in 1930 and raised in the Washington, D.C. area. His parents separated when he was young. Initially raised by his mother (Katherine Lucille Everett, née Kennedy), he was raised by his father (Hugh Everett, Jr.) and stepmother (Sarah Everett, née Thrift) from the age of seven.

At age 12, Everett wrote a letter to Albert Einstein asking him whether that which maintained the universe was something random or unifying. Einstein responded as follows:

Everett won a half scholarship to St. John&#x27;s College High School in Washington, D.C. From there, he moved to the nearby Catholic University of America to study chemical engineering as an undergraduate. There, he read about Dianetics in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;. Although he never exhibited interest in Scientology (which Dianetics became), he retained a distrust of conventional medicine throughout his life.

During World War II, Everett&#x27;s father was fighting in Europe as a lieutenant colonel on the general staff. After the war, Everett&#x27;s father was stationed in West Germany, and Everett joined him in 1949, taking a year off from his undergraduate studies. Father and son were both keen photographers and took hundreds of pictures of West Germany being rebuilt. Reflecting their technical interests, the pictures were &quot;almost devoid of people&quot;.

Everett graduated from the Catholic University of America in 1953 with a degree in chemical engineering, although he had completed sufficient courses for a mathematics degree as well.

== Princeton ==
Everett received a National Science Foundation fellowship that allowed him to attend Princeton University for graduate studies. He started his studies at Princeton in the mathematics department, where he worked on the nascent field of game theory under Albert W. Tucker, but slowly drifted into physics. In 1953 he took his first physics courses, notably &quot;Introductory Quantum Mechanics&quot; with Robert Dicke.

In 1954, Everett took Methods of Mathematical Physics with Eugene Wigner, although he remained active in mathematics and presented a paper on military game theory in December. He passed his general examinations in the spring of 1955, thereby gaining his master&#x27;s degree, and then started work on his dissertation that would (much) later make him famous. He switched thesis advisor to John Archibald Wheeler sometime in 1955, wrote a couple of short papers on quantum theory, and completed his long paper &quot;Wave Mechanics Without Probability&quot; in April 1956.

In his third year at Princeton, Everett moved into an apartment he shared with three friends he had made during his first year, Hale Trotter, Harvey Arnold and Charles Misner. Arnold later described Everett as follows:

During this time, Everett met Nancy Gore, who typed up his paper &quot;Wave Mechanics Without Probability&quot;. He married her the next year. The paper was later retitled &quot;The Theory of the Universal Wave Function&quot;.

Wheeler traveled to Copenhagen in May 1956 with the goal of getting a favorable reception for at least part of Everett&#x27;s work, but in vain. 

==Career==
In danger of losing his draft deferment, Everett took a research job with the Pentagon the year before completing the oral exam for his PhD and did not continue research in theoretical physics after his graduation. He started defense work in the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) in June 1956. Completing his PhD within a year of starting at WSEG was a job requirement, and in April 1957 he returned briefly to Princeton to defend his thesis. The oral examination took place on April 23. The principal examiners—Wheeler, Bargmann, H. W. Wyld, and Dicke—concluded: &quot;The candidate passed a very good examination. He dealt with a very difficult subject and defended his conclusions firmly, clearly, and logically. He shows marked mathematical ability, keenness in logic analyses, and a high ability to express himself well.&quot; With this Everett completed his PhD in physics from Princeton, his doctoral dissertation titled &quot;On the foundations of quantum mechanics&quot;.

A short article, which was a compromise between Everett and Wheeler about how to present the many-worlds concept and almost identical to the final version of his thesis, was published in &quot;Reviews of Modern Physics&quot;, accompanied by a favorable review by Wheeler. Everett was not happy with the article&#x27;s final form.

On October 23–26, 1956, Everett attended a weapons orientation course managed by Sandia National Laboratories at Albuquerque, New Mexico, to learn about nuclear weapons, and became a fan of computer modeling while there. In 1957, he became director of the WSEG&#x27;s Department of Physical and Mathematical Sciences. Much, but not all, of Everett&#x27;s research at WSEG remains classified. He worked on various studies of the Minuteman missile project, which was then starting, as well as the influential study &quot;The Distribution and Effects of Fallout in Large Nuclear Weapon Campaigns&quot;.

During March and April 1959, Everett visited Copenhagen at Wheeler&#x27;s request in order to meet with Niels Bohr, the &quot;father of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics&quot;. The visit was a complete disaster; Bohr &quot;rejected Everett’s approach as a whole, defending the Copenhagen approach to measurement&quot;. The conceptual gulf between their positions was too wide to allow any meeting of minds; Léon Rosenfeld, one of Bohr&#x27;s devotees, called Everett &quot;undescribably stupid&quot; and said he &quot;could not understand the simplest things in quantum mechanics&quot;. Everett later described this experience as &quot;hell...doomed from the beginning&quot;.

While in Copenhagen, Everett started work on a new idea to use generalized Lagrange multipliers for mathematical optimization. His theorem, published in 1963, relates the Lagrangian bidual to the primal problem. Lagrange multipliers had relevance for operations research, and Everett applied his discovery commercially as a defense analyst and a consultant. 

In 1962 Everett accepted an invitation to present the relative-state formulation (as it was still called) at a conference on the foundations of quantum mechanics at Xavier University. In his exposition Everett presented his derivation of probability and also stated explicitly that observers in all branches of the wavefunction were equally &quot;real.&quot; He also agreed with an observation by Boris Podolsky that &quot;It looks like we would have a non-denumerable infinity of worlds&quot;.

In August 1964, Everett and several WSEG colleagues started Lambda Corp. to apply military modeling solutions to various civilian problems. During the early 1970s, defense budgets were curtailed and most money went to operational duties in the Vietnam War, resulting in Lambda eventually being absorbed by the General Research Corp.

In 1973, Everett and Donald Reisler (a Lambda colleague and fellow physicist) left the firm to establish DBS Corporation in Arlington, Virginia. Although the firm conducted defense research (including work on United States Navy ship maintenance optimization and weapons applications), it primarily specialized in &quot;analyzing the socioeconomic effects of government affirmative action programs&quot; as a contractor under the auspices of the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. For a while, the company was partially supported by American Management Systems, a business consulting firm that drew upon algorithms Everett developed. He concurrently held a non-administrative vice presidency at AMS and was frequently consulted by the firm&#x27;s founders.

Everett cultivated an early aptitude for computer programming at IDA and favored the TRS-80 at DBS, where he primarily worked for the rest of his life.

== Later recognition ==
In 1970 Bryce DeWitt wrote an article for &quot;Physics Today&quot; on Everett&#x27;s relative-state theory, which he dubbed &quot;many-worlds&quot;, which prompted a number of letters from physicists. These letters, and DeWitt&#x27;s responses to the technical objections they raised, were also published. Meanwhile DeWitt, who had corresponded with Everett on the many-worlds / relative state interpretation when it was published in 1957, started editing an anthology on the many-worlds interpretation. In addition to the original articles by Everett and Wheeler, the anthology was dominated by Everett&#x27;s 1956 paper &quot;The Theory of the Universal Wavefunction&quot;, which had never been published before. The book was published late in 1973 and sold out completely. In 1976 an article on Everett&#x27;s work appeared in the science fiction magazine &quot;Analog&quot;.

In 1977, Everett was invited to give a talk at a conference Wheeler had organized at Wheeler&#x27;s new location at the University of Texas at Austin. As with the Copenhagen visit, Everett vacationed from his defense work and traveled with his family. Everett met DeWitt there for the first and only time. His talk was quite well received and influenced a number of physicists in the audience, including Wheeler&#x27;s graduate student David Deutsch, who later promoted the many-worlds interpretation to a wider audience. Everett, who &quot;never wavered in his belief in his many-worlds theory&quot;, enjoyed the presentation; it was the first time in years he had talked about his quantum work in public. But he did little to promote his theory, he said &quot;[I] had washed my hands of the whole affair in 1956&quot;. Wheeler started the process of returning Everett to a physics career by establishing a new research institute in California, but nothing came of that proposal. In 1980, Wheeler said he thought the theory &quot;creates too great a load of metaphysical baggage to carry along&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==
At age 51, Everett died suddenly of a heart attack at home in his bed on the night of July 18–19, 1982. His obesity, frequent chain-smoking and alcohol drinking almost certainly contributed to this, although he seemed healthy at the time. A committed atheist, he had asked that his remains be disposed of in the trash. His wife first kept his ashes in an urn, but after a few years she complied with his wishes. Of Everett&#x27;s death, his son, Mark Oliver Everett, later said: 

Of the companies Everett initiated, only Monowave Corporation still existed , in Seattle. It is managed by co-founder Elaine Tsiang, who received a PhD in physics under Bryce DeWitt at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before working for DBS as a programmer.

Everett&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth, died by suicide in 1996, and his wife died of cancer in 1998. Everett&#x27;s son, the musician Mark Oliver Everett, also known as &quot;E&quot;, is the main singer and songwriter for the band Eels. The Eels album &quot;Electro-Shock Blues&quot;, written during the late 1990s, was inspired by E&#x27;s emotional response to these deaths.

Mark Everett explored his father&#x27;s work in the hour-long BBC television documentary &quot;Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives&quot;. The program was edited and shown on the Public Broadcasting Service&#x27;s &quot;Nova&quot; series in the USA in 2008. In the program, Mark says he was unaware of his father&#x27;s status as a brilliant and influential physicist until his death.

<text>The Catskill Park is in the Catskill Mountains in the U.S. state of New York. It consists of of land inside a Blue Line in four counties: Delaware, Greene, Sullivan, and Ulster. As of 2005, or 41 percent of the land within, is owned by the state as part of the Forest Preserve; it is managed by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). Another 5% is owned by New York City to protect four of the city&#x27;s reservoirs in the region that lie partially within the park and their respective watersheds.

There are bobcats, minks and fishers in the preserve, and coyotes are often heard. There are some 400 black bears living in the region. The state operates numerous campgrounds and there are over of multi-use trails. Hunting is permitted, in season, in much of the park. It has approximately 50,000 permanent residents, bolstered somewhat by second-home ownership on weekends and in the summer, and attracts about half a million visitors every year.

The park is governed by Article 14 of the state constitution, which stipulates that all land owned or acquired by the state within cannot be sold or otherwise transferred (absent amending the constitution, which has been done on several occasions), may not be used for logging and must remain &quot;forever wild.&quot;

==Location==
The park boundary stretches from near the Hudson River just west of the city of Kingston in the east to the East Branch of the Delaware River near Hancock at its westernmost. Its northern extreme is at Windham and its southernmost point is between the hamlet of Napanoch and Rondout Reservoir.

In contrast to the Adirondack Park, the Catskill Park does not include all the land generally considered to be part of the Catskill Range. However, all but two of the 35 Catskill High Peaks are inside the Blue Line.

==History==
The area was used by the Mahican and Esopus Native Americans primarily for hunting. Later it was heavily exploited by the Dutch, English, Irish, and Germans; local industry included logging, bluestone quarrying, leather tanning, wintergreen and blueberry harvesting, trapping, fishing, and later, tourism. The old-growth hemlock and northern hardwood forests on the steep mountainsides and remote valleys were sufficiently inaccessible that they survived the logging, tanbarking and charcoal industries of the 18th and 19th centuries.

Inhabitants of the region often tell visitors the Park was created to protect New York City&#x27;s water resources. However, the park itself was created 30 years before the first reservoir (Ashokan) was built, before the city had started looking north to fulfill its growing water needs.

In 1885, as the state legislature was considering the bill that created the Adirondack Park, Ulster County was trying to get out of paying delinquent property taxes that, under the law passed over its objections six years earlier, it owed the state. The lands, mostly around Slide Mountain had come into the county&#x27;s possession when loggers looking to extract tannin for use in tanning leather from the bark of the many Eastern hemlocks growing there at the time, took the trees, made their money and then left the region without paying taxes.

The lands left behind were, if still good quality, often snapped up for use as private hunting and fishing clubs for wealthy businessmen from outside the region, whose determined enforcement of trespassing and poaching laws stirred resentment among the local populace long accustomed to the food provided by those lands; the lesser quality lands were wasted, producing nothing except destructive fires.

A team of forest experts, led by Harvard professor Charles Sprague Sargent, had visited the region when the original Forest Preserve bill was being studied and recommended against including the Catskills in its protections, as its forests &quot;guard only streams of local influence,&quot; unlike the Adirondacks, whose preservation was motivated by a desire on the part of the state&#x27;s businessmen to prevent the Erie Canal from silting up and thus becoming unnavigable.

At the same time Ulster had lost a lawsuit against the state and had been ordered to pay the back taxes. Two Assemblymen from the county (one of whom, Cornelius Hardenbergh, was a descendant of Johannes Hardenbergh, the original crown grantee of much of the Catskills in 1708) who had been elected because of their firm stands against paying the taxes, lobbied their fellow legislators heavily to pass a second version of the Forest Preserve Act, one that not only forgave the county&#x27;s tax debt in exchange for the lands at issue, but required that the state would henceforth pay whatever local property taxes were required on the land as if they were intended for commercial use (i.e., logging). That provision was later applied to the Adirondacks as well; it remains in force today and makes the difference between survival and insolvency for many towns and other local governmental entities in both parks.

As the timber industry kept making determined efforts to undermine the bill, its original sponsors took the occasion of New York adopting a new constitution in 1894 to enshrine it in that document, with language that plugged all the loopholes that loggers and officials on the state&#x27;s Forest Preserve Advisory Board had been using. Article 14 has survived several other major constitutional revisions.

===Blue Line===

The park&#x27;s creation meant an increase in state resources focused on the region. First came fire protection, a move greatly welcomed by the local governments and one that was to make a long-lasting impact on the region, as fire towers were built on a number of summits and patrols were regularly made along railroad lines to catch cinder fires before they got too big.

It also changed the way the region was seen by visitors. An era dominated by hotels such as the Catskill Mountain House at North-South Lake which catered to the well-to-do and socially prominent was passing its prime, and in its place outdoor recreationists were becoming interested in dry-fly fishing the trout streams, hunting and hiking the mountains.

In 1892, the state spent $250 to build a trail up Slide Mountain, which had only recently been proven by Arnold Henry Guyot to be the range&#x27;s highest peak and was thus attracting a great deal of tourist interest. It would be the first hiking trail built at public expense in New York&#x27;s Forest Preserve, and is still the most heavily used route up the mountain today.

That year had also seen the delineation of the Adirondack Park to the north, as the state sought to focus its land-acquisition efforts, by designating particular towns for inclusion, drawing a line in blue ink around them, a custom that continues on all official state maps today.

Twelve years later, in 1904, it was decided to do the same with the Catskills. But this Blue Line used not existing municipal boundaries but the old Hardenbergh Patent survey lots, watercourses and railroad rights-of-way, creating a finer, more focused park that gave some of the towns on its periphery areas where they could be assured land would not be subject to Article 14. A similar revision would follow suit in the Adirondacks, and future expansions of both parks would follow this model.

In 1912 the law was again amended to say that the Catskill Park consisted of all lands within the Blue Line, not just those owned by the state.
===Construction of the reservoirs===
Shortly afterwards, a new section was added to Article 14 to allow the construction of reservoirs on up to three percent of the total land in each park. The City of Greater New York, having merged in 1898, began looking for new water resources the very next year, and its existing system of reservoirs in the city and Westchester County would not be able to keep up with demand for much longer. The city at first turned to land in Rockland County now part of Harriman State Park, but found a group of speculators called the Ramapo Water Company had beaten them to the water rights. It was thus essential to go even further north, and only in the Catskill Park could it find the land to condemn around Esopus Creek and create the Ashokan Reservoir.

In 1905 the state approved the creation of water supply commissions at various local governmental levels, as well as one at the state level to resolve disputes, like the one rapidly brewing between the city and the Catskill communities over its plan to condemn land for the construction of two reservoirs, Ashokan and what is now Schoharie Reservoir, plus the Shandaken Tunnel to connect the two.

The city prevailed, and construction of Ashokan began the next year, requiring the removal of several small hamlets and many residents in the process (some, such as Shokan, West Shokan and Olive Bridge, survive on its banks). The Esopus was dammed in 1913 and started sending water to the city two years later. Land claims continued to be resolved in area courts until 1940. It was the first of several city reservoirs in and around the park.

===Mid-20th century===
For the next 50 years, within the Blue Line, the state continued to acquire land (first through the State Parks Council and successor agencies, later through the Conservation Department). As time and money permitted, the state developed trails, lean-tos and towers in a piecemeal manner.

Bond issues approved by voters in 1916 and 1924 for a total of $12.5 million led ultimately to the addition of to the state&#x27;s holdings. The economic collapse of the late 1920s and 1930s made a lot of desirable land available at low prices, and with the notably aggressive Robert Moses in charge of the state parks, valuable properties like the Devil&#x27;s Path Range, the summit of Slide Mountain and Windham High Peak became part of the Forest Preserve.
From 1926 to 1931 the state opened its first four public campgrounds within the park. New Deal programs during the Great Depression such as the Civilian Conservation Corps made labor available to build trails and replant forests. The state&#x27;s Conservation Commission was able to compile the first of a series of &quot;Catskill Trails&quot; booklets.

However, the trails built by the state rapidly fell into disuse, Raymond H. Torrey would note by the end of the decade as what hikers there were tended to bypass the Catskills in favor of the Adirondacks and higher peaks in northern New England. Unlike those regions, no lasting organizations of hikers and other passive outdoor recreationists were ever formed around the Catskills (a brief attempt to create a Catskill Mountain Club in the late 1920s sputtered out after a few years). The New York - New Jersey Trail Conference now updates and maintains many of the trails in Catskill Park, including many around Slide Mountain (Ulster County, New York).

The most important change during this time period was the amending of Article 14, in 1948 to allow for the construction of Belleayre Mountain Ski Center and thus encourage skiers to come to the Catskills, following the lead taken in the Adirondacks by the creation of Whiteface and Gore ski areas. It remains in operation and several other private ski areas such as Hunter Mountain and Windham Mountain have followed its lead.

The construction of the Interstate 87 section of the New York State Thruway up the Hudson Valley, and the upgrading of Route 17 from a two-lane road into a freeway, along much of the park&#x27;s southwestern border greatly increased access to the Park during the 1950s and &#x27;60s, although the latter encountered fierce opposition from trout fishermen over some of the original bridges along the Beaver Kill, which would have destroyed some favored holes.

New York City built three more reservoirs partially within the Park: Neversink, Rondout and Pepacton.

In 1957, the Blue Line had expanded to its present configuration, taking in not only the lands almost to the Kingston city limit and Thruway at the east, but more of Sullivan and Delaware counties in the west. Trails and other recreational resources remained underused, however. In 1966 the Catskill Mountain 3500 Club, a peak bagging organization, was formally incorporated after having existed informally for several years – the first organization devoted to, among other things, speaking for the Catskill hiking community. Three years later, in 1969, the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development was founded.

=== Temporary Commission and the Master Plan===
By the early 1970s, the Borscht Belt era was ending, as the restrictions on Jewish guests at other hotels and resorts that had given rise to it fell victim to civil rights laws, and younger generations of Jews in any event felt more assimilated than their parents and grandparents had. In the wake of the Woodstock festival, the Catskills were among the many places whose campgrounds and trails began to see many backpacking enthusiasts of the counter-culture. Previously underused trails began to finally see serious usage, almost to the point of overuse.

On Earth Day in 1970, Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed legislation that recognized growing environmental concerns by combining the Conservation Department, which had been managing the Catskills and Adirondacks, with several other agencies to create the new Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), which exists and manages the Forest Preserve to this day.

An idea that the Catskill Center had been pressing for was realized in 1973, when the state created a Temporary Commission to Study the Future of the Catskills, similar to one that it had set up in the Adirondacks. It took in as its area of study not just the Park but everywhere that could possibly be considered part of the Catskill region: all four counties of the Park, as well as Schoharie, Otsego and two towns in the southwestern corner of Albany County. It was the state&#x27;s first-ever effort to look at what resources the Catskills had and what could be done with them. The Adirondack commission&#x27;s recommendation for the establishment of a park-wide land use agency, the Adirondack Park Agency had been implemented in full, only to arouse great fury in that region as it issued zoning regulations far stricter than some towns had already enacted and mounted battles against longtime local residents over relatively small infractions. Catskills residents were worried that a similar solution awaited them.

While the commission considered the same recommendation for the Catskills, it ultimately decided against it in its final report in 1975 (it did try to promulgate a master land use plan, but that was rejected). What it did recommend was a master plan for the state land in the Forest Preserve, important since management was divided (and still is) between two different DEC regions, which had never been on the same page nor known what the other was doing.

It further recommended, following contemporary trends in public-land management (and a recommendation a special legislative committee had made back in 1960), that at least four of the growing tracts, or &quot;management units&quot; of Forest Preserve be formally designated as either &quot;wilderness areas&quot; or &quot;wild forests&quot;, again following a distinction drawn in the Adirondack Park. The former was similar in philosophy to those the federal government had already been designating in National parks and forests in the West, but slightly less restrictive; the latter is an even less restrictive category that exists only in New York&#x27;s Forest Preserve and allows for greater human impact. The practical effects are discussed below under Management.

A Master Plan was developed and implemented in the early 1980s. DEC got busy finally clarifying what user groups (in addition to hikers, snowmobilers, horseback riders and cross-country skiers) were allowed on which trails, and marking them appropriately.

===1990s===

Advocates for the Catskills wanted to build an Interpretive Center, that would educate visitors about the park and its purpose, as a focus for regional tourism. This project was begun and pursued under the administration of Governor Mario Cuomo. A site was found on New York State Route 28 near the hamlet of Mount Tremper. It was cleared and roads were built to facilitate the eventual building. The Palisades Interstate Park Commission was to operate it (to get around the restrictions of Article 14) and the New York–New Jersey Trail Conference made plans to route the Long Path past it.

George Pataki, who had been elected governor in 1995, decided to put the project on hold citing financial considerations. The site, locally referred to as the &quot;road to nowhere,&quot; was maintained, but had little to do except stop and picnic and follow the short nature trail that has been cut through the nearby woods.

Finishing the project was a cornerstone recommendation of DEC&#x27;s 1999 Public Access Plan, which again followed an Adirondack lead and proposed ways to increase public knowledge and awareness of the Park&#x27;s resources. Some were implemented (such as improving and extending the trail system, which occurred later that year when a trail across Mill Brook Ridge was completed as part of the Finger Lakes Trail, linking the trail network on the lesser peaks in the Delaware County section of the park with the long-established system in Ulster and Greene counties), some have not been.

Also in 1999, Governor Pataki designated most of the summits of the High Peaks as Bird Conservation Areas, in recognition of the importance of their boreal forests as summer habitat for Bicknell&#x27;s thrush, only recently declared to be a separate species. It was the first such designation within either Forest Preserve, and the Adirondacks would this time be the one to follow suit a few years later.

===Master Plan update===
In 2003, DEC released its long-awaited draft update to the Master Plan. It would designate more of the wild forest areas as wilderness and establish some more rules for the use of wilderness, such as limits on group size.

The most controversial aspect, however, was its decision to limit mountain biking to designated trails and ban them from wilderness areas. While this had been done everywhere else where wilderness protection existed, mountain bikers and their organizations have lobbied hard for an exception, arguing that bicycles are not machines and do not deserve to be banned from use of the wilderness. DEC missed its target date of 2004, to coincide with the park&#x27;s centennial celebrations, for the release of the final version. The revised master plan was adopted in August 2008.

The Interpretive Center project was completed and unveiled on July 1, 2015. A nature trail opened near the center in 2016.

==Climate==

According to the Köppen climate classification system, the Catskill Mountains have two climate zones. The vast majority of the Catskills have a warm summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;) with some isolated locations in valleys with hot summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;). The plant hardiness zone on Slide Mountain at 4,180 ft (1,270 m) is 5a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -16.6 °F (-27.0 °C). The plant hardiness zone in Margaretville at 1,000 ft (300 m) is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -10.6 °F (-23.7 °C)


==Management==
Under the Master Plan, all state land in the Catskills is organized into contiguous management units falling under one of four categories: Wilderness, Wild Forest, Intensive Use or Administrative.

===Wilderness===
The pending Master Plan update would add much more land to this classification, the most restrictive, although slightly less so than those on federal lands.

New York&#x27;s wilderness areas must be composed of of contiguous land, twice the federal standard. Land is to be left as &quot;untrammeled by man&quot; and as close to its natural state as possible, offering outstanding opportunities for solitude. No artificially-powered devices are permitted to be used in wilderness areas – chainsaws may only be used to clear trails with express written authorization from the DEC commissioner, and vehicle usage is forbidden in all save dire emergency circumstances. Most trails are single-track, avoiding old logging roads except at the lowest elevations. Designated campsites are kept to a minimum.

The goal of wilderness is to minimize human impact on the land as much as possible. Passive recreation such as hiking, hunting and birding is the main use of these lands.

Under the current Master Plan, many of the remaining tracts of first-growth forest, and many of the higher summits, are within wilderness areas.

Currently there are four: the Slide Mountain and Big Indian-Beaverkill wildernesses in Ulster County, and the Indian Head and West Kill wildernesses in Greene County. The updated Master Plan would add more wilderness in Greene County, most notably the Blackhead Range and Escarpment.

It has also been informal DEC policy to treat all lands in its possession in the Catskill Park above 3,100 feet (944 m) in elevation as &quot;de facto&quot; wilderness. The proposed update would not only make that rule official, it would extend it as much as possible to all land 2,700 feet (823 m) and higher.

===Wild Forest===

While still covered by the strictures of Article 14, Wild Forest areas are often lower in elevation and contain forest that has been more recently and historically disturbed, sometimes having been logged just prior to state acquisition. It is thus not as easy to avoid evidence of human impact as it is in wilderness, and consequently a higher impact is tolerated.

In Wild Forest areas, vehicles may be used as DEC designates. This has made them popular places for snowmobilers, cross-country skiers, and (in one area) mountain bikers (all-terrain vehicles remain banned, however). Hunters also find them desirable as the second- and third-growth forests in the area are more likely to contain deer and the carcass of the taken animal can be driven out of the woods instead of being walked out.

Some Wild Forest units exist with rather forced boundaries to allow for a use otherwise incompatible with a surrounding wilderness, such as the Overlook Mountain Wild Forest a corridor through the Indian Head Wilderness Area which contains the popular and still driveable dirt road to the fire tower atop the summit near Woodstock. A similar solution has been proposed under the new Master Plan to continue to allow more active use of the Hunter Mountain fire tower and the road leading up to it.

The Halcott Mountain Wild Forest is so designated only because it lacks enough contiguous area to qualify as wilderness.

Wild Forest areas besides those mentioned above include the Long Pond-Willowemoc in Sullivan County; the Touch-Me-Not, Cherry Ridge-Campbell Mountain and Dry Brook Ridge in Delaware County; the Balsam Lake, Bluestone, Lundy, Peekamoose Valley and Phoenicia-Mt. Tremper, Shandaken and Sundown in Ulster and the Blackhead, Colgate Lake, Hunter Mountain, Kaaterskill, North Point and Windham High Peak Wild Forests.

In addition to redesignating a good portion of those areas as wilderness, the proposed update would consolidate some into larger units (all the Delaware County properties, for instance).

===Intensive use===
Most of these areas save one, Belleayre Mountain Ski Center, are state campgrounds, meant for heavier, higher-impact use.

The campgrounds are generally far smaller units, with many sites and basic facilities available, sometimes abutting wilderness and wild forest areas, and paved roads offering easy vehicle access. North-South Lake, however, is a vast area (New York&#x27;s largest public campground) including not only many sites but swimming areas at both lakes, the former Catskill Mountain House site at Pine Orchard and many of the historic trails around it.

Similarly, Belleayre&#x27;s property extends well east of its ski trails and includes some of the hiking trails in the region as well.

Other campgrounds include Beaverkill, Devil&#x27;s Tombstone, Kenneth L. Wilson, Mongaup Pond and Woodland Valley.

There are at least two Day Use Areas, within the park, one near Belleayre and the other at the Catskill Interpretive Center site. These are small tracts with picnic tables and sites where camping is forbidden, much as one would find in a small local park.

===Administrative use===
These are even smaller, unnamed plots that DEC is permitted to use for non-Forest Preserve purposes. Three, the Vinegar Hill Wildlife Management Area, the Simpson Ski Slope and the Catskill Mountain Fish Hatchery, which includes the DeBruce Environmental Education Camp, and the Esopus Creek Fish and Wildlife Management Parcel.

<doc id="543426" wikidata="Q7699930" url="?curid=543426" title="Tenleytown–AU station">
<text>Tenleytown–AU station is a subway station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro in Washington, D.C. Located in the Upper Northwest neighborhood, it is the last station on the Red Line heading outbound wholly within the District of Columbia; the next stop, Friendship Heights, lies within both the District and the state of Maryland. The station serves American University (AU).

==Location==
The southernmost station underneath the Wisconsin Avenue NW corridor, Tenleytown–AU station lies within the neighborhood of the same name in the Upper Northwest portion of the city. More specifically, it lies north of Tenley Circle, below Wisconsin Avenue NW at its intersection with Albemarle Street NW. Nearby are several educational institutions, the most notable of which are: American University (AU, which has its law school on the circle, has its main campus a mile from the station, albeit connected by a shuttle); Sidwell Friends School (famous for being the school of choice of presidential children); Jackson-Reed High School; the high school of Georgetown Day School; and the affiliated National Cathedral School and St Albans Schools. In addition, Fort Reno Park and the Washington National Cathedral are located close to the station.

==History==
Originally to be called Tenley Circle, in February 1980 the Metro Board officially changed its name to Tenleytown. The station opened on August 25, 1984. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Van Ness–UDC station and the opening of the Bethesda, Friendship Heights, Grosvenor and Medical Center stations. In May 1989, although objected to by several community groups, the Metro Board officially changed its name to Tenleytown–AU due to its proximity to American University. The $63,500 cost of changing the names on signs, pylons and maps throughout the system was paid for by the District government.

== Station layout ==
This station uses the four-coffer arch design found at most underground stations on the western side of the Red Line. It is one of 11 stations constructed using rock-tunneling methods, lying more than below the surface.

Two entrances on either side of Wisconsin Avenue meet at an upper mezzanine, converging into a set of three long escalators that travel down to the fare control. An elevator adjacent to the eastern surface entrance travels down directly to the platform, with a single faregate and ticket machine to access the platform proper. The separate accessible and general entrances are a relative rarity in the Washington Metro system; only and stations share this feature.

<doc id="543427" wikidata="Q5129965" url="?curid=543427" title="Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve">
<text>Clay Pit Ponds State Park Preserve is state park located near the southwestern shore of Staten Island, New York. It is the only state park located on Staten Island.

==History==
The park was the site of extensive mining of white kaolin clay in the 19th century that provided the raw material for bricks and terra cotta. After the abandonment of the quarrying operations, rainwater, natural springs, and vegetation filled in the pits. The preserve also contains archaeological evidence of settlements of the Lenape, early European settlers, and the Free Blacks of Sandy Ground.

The park was created in 1977 after extensive lobbying by the Protectors of Pine Oak Woods, a local conservation organization.

Groundbreaking for a $1.3 million nature center was held on May 4, 2007. In October 2008, the center opened with exhibits on the history of the Charleston area and wildlife and plants found within the park. The facility contains exhibit space, classrooms, and an outdoor pavilion.

==Park description==

The park is a nature preserve, comprising wetlands, ponds, sand barrens, spring-fed streams, and woodlands. It includes pitch pine woods, and rare wildflowers such as cranberry, lizard-tail, possumhaw, and bog twayblade. The animal species found in the park include northern black racer snakes, box turtles, eastern fence lizards, Fowler&#x27;s toads, green frogs, and spring peepers. More than 170 bird species have been sighted in the park. Deer are also regularly seen there.

The purpose of the preserve is to retain the site&#x27;s unique ecology, as well as to provide educational and recreational opportunities, such a nature walks, pond ecology programs, and birdwatching. Two hiking trails – the Abraham&#x27;s Pond Trail and the Ellis Swamp Trail – are open to the public near the park headquarters, and horseback riding is permitted on of bridle paths.

The park has two designated areas, which are set aside for endangered species and are off-limits to the public.

<doc id="543428" wikidata="Q41519" url="?curid=543428" title="Compton Gamma Ray Observatory">
<text>The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) was a space observatory detecting photons with energies from 20 keV to 30 GeV, in Earth orbit from 1991 to 2000. The observatory featured four main telescopes in one spacecraft, covering X-rays and gamma rays, including various specialized sub-instruments and detectors. Following 14 years of effort, the observatory was launched from Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; during STS-37 on April 5, 1991, and operated until its deorbit on June 4, 2000. It was deployed in low Earth orbit at to avoid the Van Allen radiation belt. It was the heaviest astrophysical payload ever flown at that time at .

Costing $617 million, the CGRO was part of NASA&#x27;s Great Observatories series, along with the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. It was the second of the series to be launched into space, following the Hubble Space Telescope. The CGRO was named after Arthur Compton, an American physicist and former chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis who received the Nobel prize for work involved with gamma-ray physics. CGRO was built by TRW (now Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems) in Redondo Beach, California. CGRO was an international collaboration and additional contributions came from the European Space Agency and various universities, as well as the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory.

Successors to CGRO include the ESA INTEGRAL spacecraft (launched 2002), NASA&#x27;s Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission (launched 2004), ASI AGILE (satellite) (launched 2007) and NASA&#x27;s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (launched 2008); all remain operational as of May 2023.

==Instruments==

CGRO carried a complement of four instruments that covered an unprecedented six orders of the electromagnetic spectrum, from 20 keV to 30 GeV (from 0.02 MeV to 30000 MeV). Those are presented below in order of increasing spectral energy coverage:

===BATSE===
The Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) by NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center searched the sky for gamma-ray bursts (20 to &gt;600 keV) and conducted full-sky surveys for long-lived sources. It consisted of eight identical detector modules, one at each of the satellite&#x27;s corners. Each module consisted of both a NaI(Tl) Large Area Detector (LAD) covering the 20 keV to ~2 MeV range, 50.48 cm in dia by 1.27 cm thick, and a 12.7 cm dia by 7.62 cm thick NaI Spectroscopy Detector, which extended the upper energy range to 8 MeV, all surrounded by a plastic scintillator in active anti-coincidence to veto the large background rates due to cosmic rays and trapped radiation. Sudden increases in the LAD rates triggered a high-speed data storage mode, the details of the burst being read out to telemetry later. Bursts were typically detected at rates of roughly one per day over the 9-year CGRO mission. A strong burst could result in the observation of many thousands of gamma-rays within a time interval ranging from ~0.1 s up to about 100 s.

===OSSE===
The Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment (OSSE) by the Naval Research Laboratory detected gamma rays entering the field of view of any of four detector modules, which could be pointed individually, and were effective in the 0.05 to 10 MeV range. Each detector had a central scintillation spectrometer crystal of NaI(Tl) 12 in (303 mm) in diameter, by 4 in (102 mm) thick, optically coupled at the rear to a 3 in (76.2 mm) thick CsI(Na) crystal of similar diameter, viewed by seven photomultiplier tubes, operated as a phoswich: i.e., particle and gamma-ray events from the rear produced slow-rise time (~1 μs) pulses, which could be electronically distinguished from pure NaI events from the front, which produced faster (~0.25 μs) pulses. Thus the CsI backing crystal acted as an active anticoincidence shield, vetoing events from the rear. A further barrel-shaped CsI shield, also in electronic anticoincidence, surrounded the central detector on the sides and provided coarse collimation, rejecting gamma rays and charged particles from the sides or most of the forward field-of-view (FOV). A finer level of angular collimation was provided by a tungsten slat collimator grid within the outer CsI barrel, which collimated the response to a 3.8° x 11.4° FWHM rectangular FOV. A plastic scintillator across the front of each module vetoed charged particles entering from the front. The four detectors were typically operated in pairs of two. During a gamma-ray source observation, one detector would take observations of the source, while the other would slew slightly off source to measure the background levels. The two detectors would routinely switch roles, allowing for more accurate measurements of both the source and background. The instruments could slew with a speed of approximately 2 degrees per second.

===COMPTEL===
The Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL) by the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, the University of New Hampshire, Netherlands Institute for Space Research, and ESA&#x27;s Astrophysics Division was tuned to the 0.75-30 MeV energy range and determined the angle of arrival of photons to within a degree and the energy to within five percent at higher energies. The instrument had a field of view of one steradian. For cosmic gamma-ray events, the experiment required two nearly simultaneous interactions, in a set of front and rear scintillators. Gamma rays would Compton scatter in a forward detector module, where the interaction energy &quot;E1&quot;, given to the recoil electron was measured, while the Compton scattered photon would then be caught in one of the second layers of scintillators to the rear, where its total energy, &quot;E2&quot;, would be measured. From these two energies, &quot;E1&quot; and &quot;E2&quot;, the Compton scattering angle, angle θ, can be determined, along with the total energy, &quot;E1 + E2&quot;, of the incident photon. The positions of the interactions, in both the front and rear scintillators, was also measured. The vector, V, connecting the two interaction points determined a direction to the sky, and the angle θ about this direction, defined a cone about V on which the source of the photon must lie, and a corresponding &quot;event circle&quot; on the sky. Because of the requirement for a near coincidence between the two interactions, with the correct delay of a few nanoseconds, most modes of background production were strongly suppressed. From the collection of many event energies and event circles, a map of the positions of sources, along with their photon fluxes and spectra, could be determined.

===EGRET===
The Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) measured high energy (20 MeV to 30 GeV) gamma-ray source positions to a fraction of a degree and photon energy to within 15 percent. EGRET was developed by NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, and Stanford University. Its detector operated on the principle of electron-positron pair production from high energy photons interacting in the detector. The tracks of the high-energy electron and positron created were measured within the detector volume, and the axis of the &quot;V&quot; of the two emerging particles projected to the sky. Finally, their total energy was measured in a large calorimeter scintillation detector at the rear of the instrument.

==Results==
===Basic results===
*The EGRET instrument conducted the first all sky survey above 100 MeV. Using four years of data it discovered 271 sources, 170 of which were unidentified.
*The COMPTEL instrument completed an all sky map of (a radioactive isotope of aluminum).
*The OSSE instrument completed the most comprehensive survey of the galactic center, and discovered a possible antimatter &quot;cloud&quot; above the center.
*The BATSE instrument averaged one gamma ray burst event detection per day for a total of approximately 2700 detections. It definitively showed that the majority of gamma-ray bursts must originate in distant galaxies, not nearby in our own Milky Way, and therefore must be enormously energetic.
*The discovery of the first four soft gamma ray repeaters; these sources were relatively weak, mostly below 100 keV and had unpredictable periods of activity and inactivity
*The separation of GRBs into two time profiles: short duration GRBs that last less than 2 seconds, and long duration GRBs that last longer than this.

===GRB 990123===

Gamma ray burst 990123 (23 January 1999) was one of the brightest bursts recorded at the time, and was the first GRB with an optical afterglow observed during the prompt gamma ray emission (a reverse shock flash). This allowed astronomers to measure a redshift of 1.6 and a distance of 3.2 Gpc. Combining the measured energy of the burst in gamma-rays and the distance, the total emitted energy assuming an isotropic explosion could be deduced and resulted in the direct conversion of approximately two solar masses into energy. This finally convinced the community that GRB afterglows resulted from highly collimated explosions, which strongly reduced the needed energy budget.

===Miscellaneous results===
*The completion of both a pulsar survey and a supernova remnant survey
*The discovery of terrestrial gamma ray sources in 1994 that came from thunderclouds

== History ==

;Proposal: Work started in 1977.

;Funding and Development: CGRO was designed for in-orbit refuelling/servicing.

;Construction and test:

;Launch and Commissioning: Launched 7 April 1991. Fuel line problems were found soon after launch which discouraged frequent orbital reboosts.

;Communications: 

;Loss of data tape recorder, and mitigation: Onboard data recorders failed in 1992 which reduced the amount of data that could be downlinked. Another TDRS ground station was built to reduce the gaps in data collection.

===Orbital re-boost===

It was deployed to an altitude of 450 km on April 7, 1991, when it was first launched. Over time the orbit decayed and needed re-boosting to prevent atmospheric entry sooner than desired. It was reboosted twice using onboard propellant: in October 1993 from 340 km to 450 km altitude, and in June 1997 from 440 km to 515 km altitude, to potentially extend operation to 2007.

==De-orbit==
After one of its three gyroscopes failed in December 1999, the observatory was deliberately de-orbited. At the time, the observatory was still operational; however the failure of another gyroscope would have made de-orbiting much more difficult and dangerous. With some controversy, NASA decided in the interest of public safety that a controlled crash into an ocean was preferable to letting the craft come down on its own at random. It entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on 4 June 2000, with the debris that did not burn up (&quot;six 1,800-pound aluminum I-beams and parts made of titanium, including more than 5,000 bolts&quot;) falling into the Pacific Ocean.

This de-orbit was NASA&#x27;s first intentional controlled de-orbit of a satellite.

<text>Metro Center station is the central hub station of the Washington Metro, a rapid transit system in Washington, D.C. The station is located in Downtown, centered on the intersection of 12th Street NW and G Street NW. It is one of the 4 major transfer points in the Metrorail network. The Red Line portion of Metro Center station opened on March 27, 1976, as part of the first section of the Metro system.

The station averaged 10,587 daily riders in 2023, making it the busiest in the system.

==Station layout==
Metro Center station is laid out in two underground levels in a cross shape centered on the intersection of 12th Street NW and G Street NW. The lower level runs north-south under 12th Street between F Street and H Street, with one island platform for the Orange Line, Silver Line, and Blue Line. The upper level runs east-west under G Street between 11th Street and 13th Street, with two side platforms for the Red Line, with wide corridors above the lower level platform and tracks. Mezzanines are located above the tracks at both ends of the upper platforms.

Entrances are located on G Street at 11th Street (southeast corner), 12th Street (northeast corner), and 13th Street (southeast corner); and at the southwest corner of 12th Street and F Street. Only the 12th Street and G Street entrance has a surface elevator.

==History==

Metro Center was one of the original 6 stations to open with the first section of the Red Line on March 27, 1976. The original name of the station was &quot;12th and G&quot;, but WMATA planner William Herman argued it should be renamed, given the importance of the station and the fact that several entrances would be on other streets. Jackson Graham, the WMATA general manager at the time, agreed, and gave Herman twenty seconds to come up with a better name. Herman responded with the first words that came to mind: &quot;Metro Center&quot;.

The upper level with the Red Line opened on March 27, 1976 with the rest of the initial segment from Farragut North to Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood. The lower level opened on July 1, 1977 with the initial segment of the Blue Line from Reagan National Airport to Stadium-Armory. Orange Line service began on November 20, 1979 with the opening of the segment from Stadium–Armory to New Carrollton. Silver line service began on July 26, 2014 with the opening of the segment from East Falls Church to Wiehle-Reston East.

A pedestrian tunnel to nearby Gallery Place–Chinatown has been proposed to connect all six Metro lines within fare control. A study was published in July 2005. The station was closed from January 16–21, 2021, because of security concerns due to the Inauguration of Joe Biden.

<text>Dunwoody College of Technology is a private technology school in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It offers Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Bachelor of Architecture (B. Arch) and Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degrees.

==History==
Dunwoody College was founded as a technical institute in 1914, when Minneapolis businessman William Hood Dunwoody left three million dollars in his will to &quot;provide for all time a place where youth without distinction on account of race, color or religious prejudice, may learn the useful trades and crafts, and thereby fit themselves for the better performance of life&#x27;s duties.&quot; When his widow, Kate L. Dunwoody, died a year later she left additional funds to the school.

In the spring of 1916, the Dunwoody Trustees purchased six city blocks, 3 long and 2 deep, facing the parade grounds. The Minneapolis City Council closed the streets and alleys that traversed the area creating a site of approximately . Hewitt and Brown Architects and Engineers were contracted to design a school building. Their draft included nine buildings: six shop buildings and a three-story administration facility with an auditorium on one side and a gymnasium on the other.

The first two buildings opened in August 1917 and still exist. The Minneapolis Public Library had a branch on campus. Located across from St. Mary’s Basilica and Loring Park, just west of downtown, the new facility was dedicated on October 31, 1917, and the space at Minneapolis Central High School was left empty. University of Minnesota President Marion L. Burton gave the address. Prosser’s May 1918 commencement address contrasted the new facility with the old one used in cooperation with the Minneapolis school district: “Roughly four years ago we were quartered in an old, tumble-down building that, with the kindness of the board of education, served us well in time of need.”

When the University of Minnesota perceived a need to prepare instructors to teach in the emerging area of vocational education, it began to look for partnerships. On April 22, 1920, U of M President Fred Snyder entered into a cooperative agreement with Dunwoody Institute allowing students enrolled at the University in teacher training courses to spend part of their class time at Dunwoody to observe and practice all types of trade and industrial education. This reciprocity allowed Dunwoody instructors to enroll in and receive credit for courses offered by the College of Education at the University that were part of the teacher training authorized by the Smith Hughes Act. These matriculations were considered scholarships and did not encumber the University or the Institute in monetary exchanges, only the awarding of credits. There were no other recognizable post-secondary technical institutes or colleges at this time in Minnesota.In 1953 the Ford Foundation gave Dunwoody a grant to send representatives to consult with the Indonesian Ministry of Education. Under the leadership of Dunwoody’s second director, J. R. Kingman, an Indonesian Technical Teacher Training Institute was to be established in Bandung, Java. An American, Milton G Towner, was its advisor and director. He was on leave as director of the Staff College of the Federal Civil Defense Administration in Washington, DC. Six American teachers from Dunwoody were sent with Towner to work with indigenous Indonesians to make training available to prospective and interested teachers in the Indonesian technical school system. Seven Indonesian teachers were sent to Dunwoody for training so they could return and support Towner&#x27;s efforts. On November 27, 1953, K. Nagaraja Rao, a graduate of the University of Mysore in India, became the head of Dunwoody Industrial Institute’s new International Services Division. He had previously taught at the Illinois Institute of Technology and Korean Technical Institute, where he opened a department of chemical engineering. His job was to be the liaison between the Indonesia project and the Ford Foundation. Since 1951, he had been a consultant to the Indonesian government on the development of indigenous industries.

Phillip S. Van Wyck became the senior advisor of the Government Technical Institute in Insein, Kale, Burma. The institute&#x27;s development and operation was funded by the Ford Foundation and assisted with staffing from Dunwoody. In 1956 Dunwoody began its third technical assistance program, in the Union of Burma, establishing the first technical high school in Rangoon. In a government-sponsored building, four Dunwoody employees assisted the Burmese in developing shops, curriculum and demonstration materials. Burmese instructors were delivered the curriculum. The Annual Report of the Ford Foundation noted Dunwoody Institute’s efforts in Insein and Rangoon. It also noted that a second Teacher’s Institute was started in Jakarta.

The Central Training Institute in Bombay, India, opened in March 1963 with the assistance of a five-member team from Dunwoody, the Indian government and the US Department of Education. The March 29, 1963 issue of the &quot;Dunwoody News&quot; contains a facsimile of the formal invitation indicating that Prime Minister Nehru of India would address the institute&#x27;s inauguration ceremony. That year another project began in Khartoum, Sudan, to establish the Khartoum Senior Trade school. It opened in December 1964. Rao left Dunwoody in 1965 to become a program officer for the Ford Foundation’s Latin American program after a 12-year tenure. Robert R. Minarik, a graduate of the Dunwoody electronics program and the University of Minnesota, replaced Rao, bringing his experience from Burma and Saudi Arabia.

In 1967 Dunwoody began overseas programs with funding from private industries rather than foundations or U.S. government sponsorship. The first initiative was with the Alumina Partners of Jamaica (ALPART). ALPART asked the institute to organize and implement a training school for construction and maintenance workers. This ALPART Training Center for Industrial Skills was to serve the ALPART aluminum plant in Nain, Jamaica. A senior team of Dunwoody employees would begin to train and set in place Jamaican personnel as trainers. Time-release training aimed at select job targets dovetailed with on-the-job training and specifically customized training manuals. This partnership came to a successful conclusion in the fall of 1972. During this time, a nine-member Dunwoody team worked with Esso Standard Libya Inc at the Marsa el Brega terminal in Libya. This refinery and production complex provided an opportunity to develop curricula for and operate ESSO’s Industrial Training Center. In Saudi Arabia, the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) began a long-term training relationship that lasted into the &#x27;80s. New hardware and software for basic and mid-level electric and electronic training at the Ras Tanura Industrial Training shops were targeted. The curriculum developed there was transferable to two other sites: one in Dhahran and the other in Abqaiq. Freeport Indonesia Inc hired a Dunwoody team to help with its copper mining project in Irian Jaya. The objective was to assist in training the indigenous Indonesian workforce as electrical, mechanical, and mobile machinery operators at the townsite of Tembaga Pura. These mining facilities were remote, the Indonesians from jungle tribes and the size of the enterprise larger than Dunwoody had ever attempted before.

In 2000 Jane Plihal, associate professor and chair of the Department of Work, Community and Family Education at the College of Education and Human Development, reevaluated the 1920 “Cooperative Agreement Between Dunwoody Industrial Institute and the University of Minnesota.” She proposed termination of the agreement, seeing it as anachronistic and no longer expressive of the ways in which the two institutions had been cooperating or could cooperate. A notice of termination for this agreement signed on December 28, 2000, by Robert H. Bruininks, Executive Vice President and Provost, voided the reciprocity agreement between the two institutions at the end of summer session 2001.

In 2003 Dunwoody merged with NEI College of Technology of Columbia Heights, Minnesota, which specialized in electronics and computer technology. NEI&#x27;s operations were moved to the Dunwoody campus and the old campus sold and demolished. The combined institution was renamed the Dunwoody College of Technology.

In 2004 Dunwoody took decisive steps to diversify a student body that had long been almost exclusively white and male, hiring a director of diversity and increasing the percentage of students of color to 20%.

In 2007, the college sponsored a new charter high school in North Minneapolis, Dunwoody Academy.

<text>Dame Susan Jocelyn Bell Burnell (; Bell; born 15 July 1943) is an astrophysicist from Northern Ireland who, as a graduate student, discovered the first radio pulsars in 1967. The discovery later earned the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1974 but she was not among the awardees.

Bell Burnell was president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 2002 to 2004, president of the Institute of Physics from October 2008 until October 2010, and interim president of the Institute following the death of her successor, Marshall Stoneham, in early 2011. She was Chancellor of the University of Dundee from 2018 to 2023.

In 2018, she was awarded the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. Following the announcement of the award, she decided to use the $3 million (£2.3 million) prize money to establish a fund to help female, minority and refugee students to become research physicists. The fund is administered by the Institute of Physics.

In 2021, Bell Burnell became the second female recipient (after Dorothy Hodgkin in 1976) of the Copley Medal.

== Early life and education ==
Bell Burnell was born in Lurgan, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, to M. Allison and G. Philip Bell. Their country home was called &quot;Solitude&quot; and she grew up there with her younger brother and two younger sisters. Her father was an architect who helped design the Armagh Planetarium, and during her visits there, the staff encouraged her to pursue a career in astronomy. She also enjoyed her father&#x27;s books on astronomy.

She grew up in Lurgan and attended the Preparatory Department of Lurgan College from 1948 to 1956. At the time, boys could study technical subjects, but girls were expected to study subjects such as cooking and cross-stitching. Bell Burnell was able to study science only after her parents and others challenged the school&#x27;s policies.

She failed the eleven-plus exam and her parents sent her to The Mount School, a Quaker girls&#x27; boarding school in York, England, where she completed her secondary education in 1961. There she was favourably impressed by her physics teacher, Mr. Tillott, and stated: 

She next joined the University of Glasgow, where in 1965 she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Natural Philosophy (physics), with honours, and then New Hall, Cambridge, where she gained a PhD in 1969.

At Cambridge, she worked with Antony Hewish and others to construct the Interplanetary Scintillation Array just outside Cambridge to study quasars, which had recently been discovered.

Bell Burnell was the subject of the first part of the BBC Four three-part series &quot;Beautiful Minds&quot;, directed by Jacqui Farnham.

== Career and research ==


On 28 November 1967, while a postgraduate student at Cambridge, Bell Burnell detected a &quot;bit of scruff&quot; on her chart-recorder papers that tracked across the sky with the stars. The signal had been visible in data taken in August, but as the papers had to be checked by hand, it took her three months to find it. She established that the signal was pulsing with great regularity, at a rate of about one pulse every one and a third seconds. Temporarily dubbed &quot;Little Green Man 1&quot; (LGM-1) the source (now known as PSR B1919+21) was identified after several years as a rapidly rotating neutron star. This was later documented by the BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; series. 

In a 2020 lecture at Harvard, she related how the media was covering the discovery of pulsars, with interviews taking a standard &quot;disgusting&quot; format: Hewish would be asked on the astrophysics, and she would be the &quot;human interest&quot; part, asked about vital statistics, how many boyfriends she had, what colour is her hair, and asked to undo some buttons for the photographs. The Daily Telegraph science reporter shortened &quot;pulsating radio source&quot; to &quot;pulsar&quot;.

She worked at the University of Southampton between 1968 and 1973, University College London from 1974 to 82 and the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh (1982–91). From 1973 to 1987 she was a tutor, consultant, examiner, and lecturer for the Open University. In 1986, she became the project manager for the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, a position she held until 1991. She was Professor of Physics at the Open University from 1991 to 2001. She was also a visiting professor at Princeton University in the United States and Dean of Science at the University of Bath (2001–04), and President of the Royal Astronomical Society between 2002 and 2004.

Bell Burnell was visiting professor of astrophysics at the University of Oxford, and a Fellow of Mansfield College in 2007. She was President of the Institute of Physics between 2008 and 2010. In February 2018 she was appointed Chancellor of the University of Dundee. In 2018, Bell Burnell visited Parkes, NSW, to deliver the keynote John Bolton lecture at the Central West Astronomical Society (CWAS) AstroFest event.

In 2018, she was awarded the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, worth three million dollars (£2.3 million), for her discovery of radio pulsars. The Special Prize, in contrast to the regular annual prize, is not restricted to recent discoveries. She donated all of the money &quot;to fund women, under-represented ethnic minority and refugee students to become physics researchers&quot;, the funds to be administered by the Institute of Physics.

Issued in July 2022, Ulster Bank&#x27;s new science-themed polymer £50 banknote prominently features Bell Burnell alongside other women, including those working in NI&#x27;s life sciences industry. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m passionate about encouraging more women to pursue scientific careers and I think it&#x27;s something that is very important for Northern Ireland. There is a burgeoning scientific sector here. More women pursuing careers in science will support that ongoing growth.&quot;

=== Nobel Prize controversy ===
Controversially, Bell did not receive recognition in the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics. She helped build the Interplanetary Scintillation Array over two years and initially noticed the anomaly, sometimes reviewing as much as of paper data per night. Bell later said that she had to be persistent in reporting the anomaly in the face of scepticism from Hewish, who initially insisted it was due to interference and man-made. She spoke of meetings held by Hewish and Ryle to which she was not invited.

The paper announcing the discovery of pulsars had five authors. Bell&#x27;s thesis supervisor Antony Hewish was listed first, Bell second. Hewish was awarded the Nobel Prize, along with the astronomer Martin Ryle. At the time fellow astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle criticised Bell&#x27;s omission. In 1977, Bell Burnell commented:I believe it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in its press release announcing the prize, cited Ryle and Hewish for their pioneering work in radio-astrophysics, with particular mention of Ryle&#x27;s work on aperture-synthesis technique and Hewish&#x27;s decisive role in the discovery of pulsars.

Feryal Özel, an astrophysicist at the University of Arizona, characterized Bell Burnell&#x27;s contributions as follows:

In later years, she opined that &quot;the fact that I was a graduate student and a woman, together, demoted my standing in terms of receiving a Nobel prize.&quot; The decision continues to be debated to this day.

== Personal and non-academic life ==
Bell Burnell is house patron of Burnell House at Cambridge House Grammar School in Ballymena, County Antrim. She has campaigned to improve the status and number of women in professional and academic posts in the fields of physics and astronomy.

=== Quaker activities and beliefs ===
From her school days, she has been an active Quaker and served as Clerk to the sessions of Britain Yearly Meeting in 1995, 1996 and 1997. Bell Burnell also served as Clerk of the Central Executive Committee of Friends World Committee for Consultation from 2008 to 2012. She delivered a Swarthmore Lecture under the title &quot;Broken for Life&quot;, at Yearly Meeting in Aberdeen on 1 August 1989, and was the plenary speaker at the US Friends General Conference Gathering in 2000. She spoke of her personal religious history and beliefs in an interview with Joan Bakewell in 2006.

Bell Burnell served on the Quaker Peace and Social Witness Testimonies Committee, which produced &quot;Engaging with the Quaker Testimonies: a Toolkit&quot; in February 2007. In 2013, she gave a James Backhouse Lecture which was published in a book entitled &quot;A Quaker Astronomer Reflects: Can a Scientist Also Be Religious?&quot;, in which Burnell reflects about how cosmological knowledge can be related to what the Bible, Quakerism or Christian faith states.

=== Marriage ===
In 1968, between the discovery of the second and third pulsar, Bell became engaged to Martin Burnell and they married soon after; the couple divorced in 1993 after separating in 1989. In a 2021 online lecture at the University of Bedfordshire, Bell Burnell reflected on her first experience returning to the observatory wearing an engagement ring. Though she was proud of her ring and wanted to share the good news with her colleagues, she instead received criticism as, at the time, it was shameful for women to work as it appeared that their partners were incapable of providing for the family. 

Her husband was a local government officer, and his career took them to various parts of Britain. She worked part-time for many years while raising their son, Gavin Burnell, who is a member of the condensed matter physics group at the University of Leeds.

<text>A League of Their Own is a 1992 American sports comedy drama film directed by Penny Marshall that tells a fictionalized account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). It stars Tom Hanks, Geena Davis, Madonna, Lori Petty, Jon Lovitz, David Strathairn, Garry Marshall, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, and Bill Pullman and was written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, from a story by Kelly Candaele and Kim Wilson.

It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $132.4 million worldwide and garnering acclaim for Marshall&#x27;s direction and the performances of its ensemble cast. In 2012, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==

In 1988, Dottie Hinson attends the opening of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League exhibit at the Baseball Hall of Fame. She sees pictures of many former teammates and friends, prompting a flashback to 1943.

With World War II threatening to shut down Major League Baseball (MLB), Chicago Cubs owner Walter Harvey persuades his fellow owners to bankroll a women&#x27;s league. Ira Lowenstein is put in charge. Scout Ernie Capadino attends an industrial-league softball game in Oregon and likes what he sees in Dottie, the catcher for a local dairy. She is not interested, and is happy with her life, waiting for her husband Bob to return from the war. Her younger sister, Kit Keller, however, is desperate to escape and make something of herself. Capadino is unimpressed by Kit&#x27;s batting and refuses to watch her pitch, but agrees to take her along if she changes Dottie&#x27;s mind. Dottie agrees for her sister&#x27;s sake.

Dottie and Kit travel to Harvey Field in Chicago for tryouts; en route, they force Capadino to accept homely second baseman Marla Hooch. They meet taxi dancer Mae &quot;All-the-Way-Mae&quot; Mordabito and her best friend, bouncer Doris Murphy, soft-spoken right fielder Evelyn Gardner, illiterate left fielder Shirley Baker, pitcher/shortstop and former Miss Georgia beauty queen Ellen Sue Gotlander, left field/relief pitcher Betty &quot;Spaghetti&quot; Horn, first baseman Helen Haley and Alice &quot;Skeeter&quot; Gaspers. They and five others constitute the Rockford Peaches, while 48 others make up the Racine Belles, the Kenosha Comets and the South Bend Blue Sox.

The Peaches are managed by former star, Cubs slugger Jimmy Dugan, a cynical alcoholic. He initially treats the whole concept as a joke, forcing Dottie to take over as on-field leader, initially. Dugan is also abrasive toward his players. The team travels with Evelyn&#x27;s spoiled, bratty son Stillwell and team chaperone Miss Cuthburt. With a &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer in the stands, Lowenstein begs the players to do something spectacular, as the league has attracted little attention. Dottie obliges, catching a popped-up ball behind home plate while doing a split. The resulting photograph makes the magazine cover. A publicity campaign draws more people to the ballgames, but the owners remain unconvinced.

The teammates bond. Marla marries a man named Nelson whom she met on a raucous roadhouse outing and leaves the team for the rest of the season, Mae teaches Shirley to read, and Evelyn writes a team song. Lowenstein promotes Dottie as the face of the league, making Kit resentful. Their sibling rivalry intensifies, resulting in Kit&#x27;s trade to the Racine Belles.

The Peaches end the season with the league&#x27;s best record, qualifying for the World Series. Jimmy gives Betty a telegram, informing her that her husband was killed in action in the Pacific Theater. Grief-stricken, she leaves the team. That evening, Dottie receives a surprise when Bob shows up, having been wounded and discharged from the Army. Jimmy discovers that Dottie is going home with Bob. Unable to persuade her to play in the World Series, he tells her she will regret her decision.

The Peaches face the Belles in the World Series, which goes the full seven games. Dottie rejoins the Peaches for the seventh game, while Kit is the starting pitcher for the Belles. With the Belles leading by a run in the top of the ninth, Dottie drives in the go-ahead run. Kit is distraught, but gets a second chance when she comes to bat with two outs in the bottom of the ninth. She gets a hit and, ignoring the third base coach&#x27;s sign to stop, scores the winning run by knocking her sister over at the plate and dislodging the ball from Dottie&#x27;s hand.

The sellout crowd convinces Harvey to give Lowenstein the owners&#x27; support. After the game, the sisters reconcile before Dottie leaves with Bob.

Back in the present at Cooperstown, Dottie is reunited with the other players, including Kit, Capadino and Lowenstein; she sees that Jimmy died a year earlier, in 1987. The surviving Peaches sing Evelyn&#x27;s team song and pose for a photo. During the closing credits, they play baseball once again at Doubleday Field.

==Production==
===Development===
Director Penny Marshall was inspired by the 1987 TV documentary &quot;A League of their Own,&quot; about the All American Girls Professional Baseball League. She had never heard of the league, and contacted the film&#x27;s creators, Kelly Candaele and Kim Wilson, to collaborate with the screenwriters, Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz, on producing a screenplay for 20th Century Fox. Fox eventually passed on the script and Marshall signed with Sony Pictures, which was eager to produce it.

=== Casting ===
On MLB Network&#x27;s &quot;Costas at the Movies&quot; in 2013, director Penny Marshall talked about her initial interest in Demi Moore for the part of Dottie Hinson: &quot;Demi Moore, I liked, but by the time we came around, she was pregnant.&quot; Debra Winger was then cast as Dottie and spent three months training with the Chicago Cubs in preparation. However, she dropped out of the production four weeks before the start of principal photography, later saying that the casting of Madonna was the reason for her decision. Marshall chose Geena Davis to replace Winger.

USC assistant baseball coach Bill Hughes was the film&#x27;s technical adviser and put the film&#x27;s ensemble cast through baseball camp three months before filming.

===Filming===
Principal photography began July 10, 1991. Filming the game scenes involved many physical mishaps among the actors: Anne Ramsay broke her nose with a baseball mitt while trying to catch a ball, and the large bruise seen on Renée Coleman&#x27;s thigh at one point in the movie was real.
Discussing the skirts they wore playing in the film, Geena Davis said on MLB Network&#x27;s &quot;Costas at the Movies&quot; in 2013, &quot;Some of our real cast, from sliding into home, had ripped the skin off their legs. It was nutty.&quot; In a 2021 interview, Petty claimed to have broken her foot during filming, but reiterated her enjoyment of the shoot and the understanding of the film&#x27;s importance at the time.

The tryout scene, at a fictional Major League Baseball stadium in Chicago called Harvey Field, was filmed at the Chicago Cubs&#x27; home stadium, Wrigley Field. The Rockford Peaches&#x27; home games were filmed at League Stadium in Huntingburg, Indiana, and the championship game against Racine was filmed at Bosse Field in Evansville, Indiana. Additional games were filmed at Jay Littleton Ball Park in Ontario, California. The house where the Rockford Peaches lived is in Henderson, Kentucky; in addition to interior shots, the exterior of the house is visible both when one of the team members weds and drives off with her husband and when Dottie is leaving with her husband. Railroad depot and onboard train scenes were filmed at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois. The final week of shooting was during late October 1991 in Cooperstown, New York, where 65 original AAGPBL members appeared in scenes recreating the induction of the league into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988.

Due to the length of the schedule, the cast entertained themselves by putting on an elaborate amateur production, &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar Goes Hawaiian&quot;.

===Soundtrack===
The &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; soundtrack was released on CD and cassette tape by Columbia Records on June 30, 1992. The album peaked at #159 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart on July 25, 1992. Although Madonna contributed &quot;This Used to Be My Playground&quot; to the film, featured over the closing credits, her recording was not included on the soundtrack album for contractual reasons.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;A League of Their Own&quot; was released on July 1, 1992, and grossed $13.2 million in its first weekend, finishing second at the box office behind &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. In its second weekend it dropped just 15%, making $11.5 million and finishing first. It ended up a commercial success, making $107.5 million in the United States and Canada, but only $24.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $132.4 million against a production budget of $40 million.

===Critical response===
&quot;A League of Their Own&quot; was well received by critics, who praised the cast.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 82% based on 82 reviews, with an average score of 7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Sentimental and light, but still thoroughly charming, &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; is buoyed by solid performances from a wonderful cast.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 69 based 21 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Though big of budget, &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; is one of the year&#x27;s most cheerful, most relaxed, most easily enjoyable comedies. It&#x27;s a serious film that&#x27;s lighter than air, a very funny movie that manages to score a few points for feminism in passing.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it three out of four stars, and wrote: &quot;The movie has a real bittersweet charm. The baseball sequences, we&#x27;ve seen before. What&#x27;s fresh are the personalities of the players, the gradual unfolding of their coach and the way this early chapter of women&#x27;s liberation fit into the hidebound traditions of professional baseball.&quot;

===Accolades===
On December 19, 2012, it was announced that &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; would be preserved in the United States National Film Registry.

Jimmy Dugan&#x27;s (Tom Hanks) remark to Evelyn Gardner (Bitty Schram), &quot;There&#x27;s no crying in baseball!&quot;, was ranked 54th on the American Film Institute&#x27;s 2005 list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.

==Home media==
&quot;A League of Their Own&quot; was released as a 20th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray on October 16, 2012.

Forty-seven former AAGPBL players reunited in New York to celebrate the film and the real women who inspired it. Events included a trip to Cooperstown for a special program at the National Baseball Hall of Fame, reminiscent of the film&#x27;s final scene depicting AAGPBL players and family meeting to honor the Women&#x27;s Professional Baseball League. The reunion wrapped up with a game of softball held at Alliance Bank Stadium in nearby Syracuse.

Former players also made an appearance at Bosse Field in Evansville, Indiana on June 6, 2012, where many of the film&#x27;s game scenes were filmed. Bosse Field still retains many of the Racine Belles themes from the movie. The event included an outdoor screening of the film, and a display of cars featured in the film. In addition to Bosse Field, the production used Huntingburg, Indiana&#x27;s League Stadium, another Southwestern Indiana field older than Bosse, that was renovated for it.

==Spinoffs==
A short-lived series of the same title based on the film aired on CBS in April 1993, with Garry Marshall, Megan Cavanagh, Tracy Reiner, Freddie Simpson and Jon Lovitz reprising their roles. Carey Lowell took over Geena Davis&#x27;s role. Only five of the six episodes made were broadcast.

On August 6, 2020, Amazon Video ordered a reboot series with the same title as the movie. The series debuted on August 12, 2022, on Amazon. The series was renewed in March 2023 for a four-episode final season, but in August 2023, Amazon announced that the second season would be scrapped due to delays caused by the WGA strike.

<doc id="543434" wikidata="Q463305" url="?curid=543434" title="American Academy of Pediatrics">
<text>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is the largest professional association of pediatricians in the United States. It is headquartered in Itasca, Illinois, and maintains an office in Washington, D.C. The AAP has published hundreds of policy statements, ranging from advocacy issues to practice recommendations.

==Background==
The Academy was founded in 1930 by 35 pediatricians to address pediatric healthcare standards. , it has 67,000 members in primary care and sub-specialist areas. Qualified pediatricians can become fellows (FAAP). The Academy runs continuing medical education (CME) programs for pediatricians and sub-specialists. The Academy is divided into 14 departments and 26 divisions.

===Publications===
It has the largest pediatric publishing program in the world, with more than 300 titles for consumers and over 500 titles for physicians and other healthcare professionals. These publications include electronic products, professional references, medical textbooks, practice management publications, patient education materials, and parenting books. The &quot;AAP News&quot; is the academy&#x27;s official news magazine, and &quot;Pediatrics&quot; is its flagship journal.

The AAP issues a weekly report on COVID-19 cases in the United States. States began reporting COVID-19 cases on September 17, 2020. The AAP tracked 587,948 child COVID-19 cases, 5,016 child hospitalizations, and 109 child deaths.

== The Julius B. Richmond Center ==
In 2006, the Academy received a grant from the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI) to plan and establish a Center of Excellence dedicated to the elimination of children&#x27;s exposure to tobacco and secondhand smoke. The Richmond Center was established to help institutionalize pediatric tobacco control activities at AAP and was named in honor of Julius B. Richmond, MD, Chair of the FAMRI Medical Advisory Board and former Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service. The Center provides the education, training, and tools needed to protect children from tobacco and secondhand smoke.

== Policy positions ==
The Academy has published hundreds of policy statements, ranging from advocacy issues to practice recommendations. The academy&#x27;s policy website contains all current Academy policies and clinical reports. The AAP policy regarding its statements is to give each statement a five-year life, after which the statement expires unless it is reaffirmed.

=== Abortion ===
The AAP is supportive of abortion rights and criticized the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. In June 2022, they stated that adolescents &quot;should have the right to receive legal and confidential medical and surgical abortion care and counseling&quot; and that &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson] means that in many places in the United States, this evidence-based care will be difficult or impossible to access, threatening the health and safety of our patients and jeopardizing the patient-physician relationship&quot;.

=== Age limit ===
The AAP has changed positions on its age limit throughout the years. In 1988, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a statement on the age limit of pediatrics that identified the upper age limit of pediatrics as age 21. The policy had a note that exceptions could always be made when the doctor and family jointly agree to an older age.

Recent studies have shown that the age of 21 years is just an arbitrary line for adolescence, because brain development does not fully reach adult levels of functioning until the early 30s. In a 2017 policy update, AAP changed its policy to discourage age limits of pediatric providers and instead have families reach an agreement with their pediatric provider as to when to transition care.

===Asthma===
In 2009, the national office and four of its State chapters provided training support to 49 pediatric practices to improve adherence to well-established asthma care guidelines. The percentage of patients at participating practices with well-controlled asthma (as defined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute) rose from 58 to 72 percent.

===Car safety seats===
The AAP periodically issues guidance for child passenger safety, including policy recommendations for transitioning between rear-facing car seats, front-facing car seats, belt-positioning booster seats, and vehicle safety belts. These recommendations are typically published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal &quot;Pediatrics.&quot;

Previously, the AAP recommended that children remain rear-facing until they are two years of age. In response to updated crash test, simulation, and field data, the AAP revised their guidance to exclude the age guideline entirely. Current AAP Child Passenger Safety recommendations () state that children should remain in a rear-facing car seat for as long as possible, until they meet the maximum height or weight dictated by the car seat manufacturer.

===COVID schooling in person===
On June 29, 2020, AAP stated that it &quot;strongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school&quot; as remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States made it more difficult for education professionals to notice learning deficits, physical and sexual abuse, depression and suicidal ideation. The AAP argued that masks are probably not practical for children younger than middle school unless they can wear a mask without increased face touching. Teachers&#x27; unions opposed the AAP statement, however, saying &quot;Our educators are overwhelmingly not comfortable returning to schools ... They fear for their lives, the lives of their students and the lives of their families.&quot; Two weeks later, the AAP walked back its support, under political pressure from teachers and other groups. The then-president Donald Trump cited AAP&#x27;s original statement repeatedly, pressuring school leaders to reopen schools.

===Digital advertising to children===
In its 2020 statement in &quot;Pediatrics&quot;, the AAP called for banning all digital advertising that was targeted to children under the age of 7 and urged limits to advertising aimed at people under 17. This aimed to protect kids from digital tracking on social media, Tv and video games.

===Elective infant circumcision===

In a 2012 position statement, the academy stated that a systematic evaluation of the medical literature shows that the &quot;preventive health benefits of elective circumcision of male newborns outweigh the risks of the procedure&quot; and that the health benefits &quot;are sufficient to justify access to this procedure for families choosing it and to warrant third-party payment for circumcision of male newborns&quot;, but &quot;are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision for all male newborns&quot;. The academy takes the position that parents should make the final decision about circumcision after appropriate information is gathered about the risks and benefits of the procedure.

===Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems===
Electronic nicotine delivery systems (electronic cigarettes, e-hookahs, vape pens, others) are highly addictive and often candy-flavored products that are rapidly rising in popularity among middle and high school students, and appear to be serving as a gateway to other forms of tobacco, and threaten to addict a new generation to nicotine.

===Gun violence===
The American Academy of Pediatrics says that although firearms-related deaths in the US have dropped since the 1990s, guns were used in more than 80 percent of teen homicides in 2009 and were the most common suicide method among US teens. The AAP believes pediatricians should discuss guns and gun safety with parents before babies are born and at children&#x27;s annual exams. It also advocates for, among other things, more background checks, an assault weapons ban, and more federal research on gun violence.

===Marijuana===
The AAP warns of possible marijuana damage to children and adolescents. In states that have already legalized marijuana, the Academy recommends that pediatricians and regulators treat it as they would tobacco. The Academy supports &quot;decriminalization&quot; of marijuana (reductions in the penalties for its use and possession) in combination with an increased commitment to substance-abuse treatment. The Academy recommends changing marijuana from a DEA Schedule I to a DEA Schedule II to facilitate research into pharmaceutical uses.

===School start times for adolescents===
Recognizing that insufficient sleep in adolescents is an important public health issue that significantly affects the health and safety, as well as academic success, the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports efforts of school districts to optimize sleep in students and urges high schools and middle schools to aim for start times no earlier than 8:30 a.m., to allow students the opportunity to achieve optimal levels of sleep (8.5–9.5 hours) and to improve physical and mental health, safety, academic performance, and quality of life. Although the AAP acknowledges that numerous factors may impair the amount and/or quality of sleep in adolescents—among them, biological changes in sleep associated with puberty, lifestyle choices, and academic demands—it considers school start times before 8:30 a.m. (&quot;earlier school start times&quot;) to be a key modifiable contributor to insufficient sleep, together with circadian rhythm disruption. It also recognizes that a substantial body of research has demonstrated that delaying the start of the school day is an effective countermeasure to chronic sleep loss and has a wide range of potential benefits to the physical and mental health, safety, and academic achievement of students—including reduced obesity risk, rates of depression, and drowsy driving crashes as well as improved academic performance and quality of life. Later start times also result in less frequent tardiness.

===Abusive head trauma===
There is limited medical controversy surrounded the AAP regarding abusive head trauma (AHT), also called &quot;shaken baby syndrome&quot; in infants. The current skepticism is not whether violent shaking or shaking with slamming is dangerous to infants and children, but of how the scientific information is used in the legal processes. The AAP updated its policy paper in 2020. In the updated policy paper, the APP states &quot;The AAP continues to affirm the dangers and harms of shaking infants, continues to embrace the &#x27;shaken baby syndrome&#x27; diagnosis as a valid subset of the AHT diagnosis, and encourages pediatric practitioners to educate community stakeholders when necessary.&quot;

===Statins for high cholesterol in children===
In 2008, the AAP and the American Heart Association recommended statins for children as young as eight years with high lipid concentrations and for children as young as two years with major cardiovascular risk factors, if weight management, dietary changes, and additional physical exercise were not sufficient to reduce the risk of heart disease. The organizations were criticized by bloggers and the editorial board of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who expressed &quot;fear that it will open the way for drug companies to bombard anxious parents with ads promoting these and other products and increase the number of parents insisting on prescriptions for their children. The ease of popping pills should not distract parents, health professionals, or policy makers from the more arduous tasks of cutting back on junk foods, promoting healthy diets, and putting physical education back into the schools.&quot;

===Tobacco===
AAP recommends that tobacco control programs should change the image of tobacco by telling the truth about the substance. This includes prohibiting tobacco advertising and promotion that is accessible to children, as well as point of sale advertising, product placements in movies and other entertainment media, and promotion in print or internet-based media accessible to youth. Advertising and promotion has been shown to be a cause of tobacco use initiation in adolescents.

AAP supports a minimum purchasing age of 21 years for tobacco products. Increasing age of purchase has been shown to decrease youth smoking rates. Younger age of starting tobacco use leads to lower rates of ever stopping tobacco use.

===LGBT healthcare===
According to &quot;Block (2023)&quot;, the AAP and other American medical professional groups have becoming increasingly aligned in supporting gender affirming care for gender dysphoria, which may include gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogues (GnRHa) to suppress puberty; oestrogen or testosterone to promote secondary sex characteristics; and surgical removal or augmentation of breasts, genitals, or other physical features.

In 2018, the AAP issued a policy statement putting forward a model of gender affirmative care. Gender affirmative care is based in the idea that transgender identities and diverse gender expressions do not constitute a mental disorder, that variations in gender identity and expression are normal aspects of human diversity, and binary definitions of gender do not always reflect emerging gender identities, that gender identity evolves as an interplay of biology, development, socialization, and culture, and that if a mental health issue exists, it most often stems from stigma and negative experiences rather than being intrinsic to the child.

The AAP also describe conversion therapy as &quot;unsuccessful&quot;, &quot;deleterious&quot; and &quot;outside the mainstream of traditional medical practice&quot;. Finally, the AAP recommends that youth identifying as transgender have access to comprehensive and development-appropriate healthcare provided in safe and inclusive clinics but also that family based therapy be available. The AAP also recommend that the medical field and federal government prioritize research that is dedicated to improving the quality of evidence-based care for transgender youth.

== Programs ==
=== Brush, Book, Bed ===
Brush, Book, Bed (BBB) is an American Academy of Pediatrics program aimed at improving children&#x27;s health by creating a nighttime routine of brushing the child&#x27;s teeth, reading together, and setting a bedtime. It was developed to help pediatricians communicate a simple message to families.

<text>Stephen J. Pyne (born 1949) is an emeritus professor at Arizona State University, specializing in environmental history, the history of exploration, and especially the history of fire.

==Education==
Pyne received his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Stanford University after graduating from Brophy College Preparatory, a Jesuit high school, in Phoenix, Arizona. He later attained his master&#x27;s (1974) and Ph.D. degrees (1976) at the University of Texas at Austin, receiving a MacArthur Fellowship in 1988. He also received a summer Fulbright Fellowship to Sweden, was awarded two National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowships, and had two tours at the National Humanities Center. He was a professor at Arizona State University from 1985 to 2018.

Pyne spent fifteen seasons as a wildland firefighter at the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park between 1967 and 1981, twelve as crew boss. He later spent the summers of 1983–85 writing fire plans for Rocky Mountain and Yellowstone national parks.

== Career and research ==
Many of Pyne&#x27;s works recount the history of exploration. These writings include his biography of G.K. Gilbert, &quot;The Ice&quot;, &quot;How the Canyon Became Grand&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot;, and &quot;The Great Ages of Discovery. How Western Civilization Learned About a Wider World&quot;. Other works include &quot;The Last Lost World&quot;, which he wrote with his daughter, Lydia V. Pyne, and two books on writing nonfiction, &quot;Voice and Vision&quot; and &quot;Style and Story&quot;.

Since the 1982 publication of his second book, &quot;Fire in America&quot;, Pyne has become an authority on the history and management of fire, cataloging the fire histories of Australia, Canada, Europe (including Russia), Mexico, and the overall planet. He has written and co-authored three textbooks on landscape fires and their management. His 2015 book &quot;Between Two Fires&quot; and nine-volume series of regional fire reconnaissances,&quot;To the Last Smoke&quot;, update his earlier history of US fire, surveying events from 1960 to 2013. He is frequently asked to provide historical and comparative context for current fire-related issues.

Pyne has criticized the proposed Anthropocene epoch as emphasizing a single species&#x27; domination over the environment. He instead advocates for a &quot;Pyrocene epoch&quot; defined by humanity&#x27;s usage of fire, opposite to the Pleistocene epoch&#x27;s Ice Age. Managed combustion of fossil fuels has supported the industrialization that is causing significant reductions in biodiversity and climate change, while the nuclear weapons testing has increased the soil concentration of trace elements.

<text>The Souris River (; ) or Mouse River (as it is alternatively known in the U.S., a translation of its French name) is a river in central North America. Approximately in length, it drains about in Canada and the United States.

Rising in southern Saskatchewan in the Yellow Grass Marshes north of Weyburn, the river wanders southeast into the U.S. through North Dakota beyond Minot to its most southern point at Velva, and then back north into Canada in southwestern Manitoba.

Flowing east, it passes through the communities of Melita, Hartney, Souris, and Wawanesa, Manitoba, prior to the confluence with the Assiniboine River near Treesbank, about southeast of Brandon. The main tributaries of the Souris in Manitoba are the Antler River, Gainsborough Creek, and Plum Creek. The elevation at the confluence is approximately above sea level.

At the end of the last ice age, over 10,000 years ago, the rapid draining of former Glacial Lake Regina eroded a large channel that is now occupied by the much smaller contemporary Souris River. Also, much of the drainage basin is fertile silt and clay deposited by another former glacial lake, Lake Souris.

== Flow rates and flood potential ==
During the period from 1930 to 1941 severe drought conditions prevailed and PFRA constructed four stock watering dams. In 1937 the Snyder and Ross Dams were built near Melita. In 1938 the Napinka Dam was built and the Hartney Dam was built in 1941. These were all stop log dams with a total capacity of . The Souris Dam was originally built in 1911 and was rebuilt in 1935. The Wawanesa Dam was completed in 1951 storing about of water.

Most of the annual flow of the Souris River comes from snow melt and spring rains. The annual flow volume varies dramatically from in 1937 to in 1976. It is expected that the total runoff for 2011 at Wawanesa will exceed about a one in 500-year event. The average annual runoff is equivalent to 3 mm over the entire Souris River watershed.

Two large dams in Saskatchewan, Rafferty Dam and Grant Devine Dam were built, in part, to reduce flood peaks on the Souris River.

In summer 2011, a historic flood affected much of the Souris River basin, overtopping levees and causing the evacuation of about 11,000 residents in Minot as well as significant damage to farmland and other property along the length of the river.

The channel capacity of the river in Manitoba varies from about near the border, to about through Melita, to about near Lauder and near Hartney. North of Hartney the capacity increases to more than . The drop between the border and Hartney is only about .

<text>An Arizona state park is an area of land in the U.S. state of Arizona preserved by the state for its natural, cultural, or recreational resources. The state park system in Arizona includes both state parks and state historic parks, as well as other designations such as natural areas and recreation areas. Arizona currently has 31 state park units, which are managed wholly or partly by the Arizona State Parks government agency. In 2010 several Arizona state parks were closed due to budget cuts. Some have since reopened thanks to support in the form of donations and partnerships with local agencies.

<doc id="543450" wikidata="Q753058" url="?curid=543450" title="Attack helicopter">
<text>An attack helicopter is an armed helicopter with the primary role of an attack aircraft, with the offensive capability of engaging ground targets such as enemy infantry, military vehicles and fortifications. Due to their heavy armament they are sometimes called helicopter gunships.

Attack helicopters can use weapons including autocannons, machine guns, rockets, and anti-tank missiles such as the AGM-114 Hellfire. Some attack helicopters are also capable of carrying air-to-air missiles, though mostly for purposes of self-defense against other helicopters and low-flying light combat aircraft.

A modern attack helicopter has two primary roles: first, to provide direct and accurate close air support for ground troops; and second, the anti-tank role to destroy grouped enemy armored vehicles. Attack helicopters are also used as protective escort for transport helicopters, or to supplement lighter helicopters in the armed reconnaissance roles. In combat, an attack helicopter is projected to destroy targets worth around 17 times its own production cost before being destroyed.

== Development ==
===Background===
Low-speed, fixed wing Allied aircraft like the Soviet Polikarpov Po-2 training and utility biplane had been used as early as 1942 to provide night harassment attack capability against the &quot;Wehrmacht Heer&quot; on the Eastern Front, most effectively in the Battle of the Caucasus as exemplified by the Night Witches all-female Soviet air unit. Following Operation Overlord in 1944, the military version of the similarly slow-flying Piper J-3 Cub high-wing civilian monoplane, the L-4 Grasshopper, begun to be used in a light anti-armor role by a few U.S. Army artillery spotter units over France; these aircraft were field-outfitted with either two or four bazooka rocket launchers attached to the lift struts, against German armored fighting vehicles. During the summer of 1944, U.S. Army Major Charles Carpenter managed to successfully take on an anti-armor role with his rocket-armed Piper L-4. His L-4, bearing US Army serial number 43-30426 and named &quot;Rosie the Rocketer&quot;, armed with six bazookas, had notable success in an engagement during the Battle of Arracourt on September 20, 1944, employing top attack tactics in knocking out at least four German armored vehicles, as a pioneering example of taking on heavy enemy armor from a slow-flying aircraft.
The Germans were also engaged in such ad hoc low-speed light aircraft platforms for ground attack very late in the war, with one subtype of the Bücker &quot;Bestmann&quot; trainer—the Bü 181C-3—armed with four &quot;Panzerfaust&quot; 100 anti-tank grenade launchers, two under each of the low-winged monoplane&#x27;s wing panels, for the concluding two months of the war in Europe. This sort of role, being undertaken by low-speed fixed-wing light aircraft was something that was also likely to be achievable after World War II, from the increasing numbers of post-war military helicopter designs. The only American helicopter in use during the war years, the Sikorsky R-4, was only being used for rescue and were still very much experimental in nature.
In the early 1950s, various countries around the world started to make increased use of helicopters in their operations in transport and liaison roles. Later on it was realised that these helicopters, successors to the World War II-era Sikorsky R-4, could be armed with weapons in order to provide them with limited combat capability. Early examples include armed Sikorsky H-34s in service with the US Air Force and armed Mil Mi-4 in service with the Soviet Air Forces. This &quot;experimental&quot; trend towards the development of dedicated attack helicopters continued into the 1960s with the deployment of armed Bell UH-1s and Mil Mi-8s during the Vietnam War, to this day the pair of most produced helicopter designs in aviation history. These helicopters proved to be moderately successful in these configurations, but due to a lack of armor protection and speed, they were ultimately ineffective platforms for mounting weapons in higher-threat ground combat environments.

Since the 1960s, various countries around the world started to design and develop various types of helicopters with the purpose of providing a heavily armed and protected aerial vehicle that can perform a variety of combat roles, from reconnaissance to aerial assault missions. By the 1990s, the missile-armed attack helicopter evolved into a primary anti-tank weapon. Able to quickly move about the battlefield and launch fleeting &quot;pop-up attacks&quot;, helicopters presented a major threat even with the presence of organic air defenses. The helicopter gunship became a major tool against tank warfare, and most attack helicopters became more and more optimized for the antitank mission.

=== United States ===
Amid the opening months of the Korean War era, during August 1950, a joint US Navy and Marine Corps test used a newly acquired Bell HTL-4 helicopter to test if a bazooka could be fired from a helicopter in flight. One of the larger 3.5 inch (90mm calibre) models of the bazooka was chosen, and was mounted ahead and to the right of the helicopter to allow the door to remain clear. The bazooka was successfully tested, although it was discovered that it would require shielding for the engine compartment, which was exposed in the model 47 and other early helicopters. The helicopter itself belonged to HMX-1, a Marine experimental helicopter squadron.

In the mid-1960s, the U.S. Army concluded that a purpose-built attack helicopter with more speed and firepower than current armed helicopters was required in the face of increasingly intense ground fire (often using heavy machine guns and anti-tank rockets) from Viet Cong and NVA troops. Based on this realization, and with the growing involvement in Vietnam, the U.S. Army developed the requirements for a dedicated attack helicopter, the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS). The aircraft design selected for this program in 1965, was Lockheed&#x27;s AH-56 Cheyenne.

As the Army began its acquisition of a dedicated attack helicopter, it sought options to improve performance over the continued use of improvised interim aircraft (such as the UH-1B/C). In late 1965, a panel of high-level officers was selected to evaluate several prototype versions of armed and attack helicopters to determine which provided the most significant increase in capability to the UH-1B. The three highest-ranked aircraft, the Sikorsky S-61, Kaman H-2 &quot;Tomahawk&quot;, and the Bell AH-1 Cobra, were selected to compete in flight trials conducted by the Army&#x27;s Aviation Test Activity. Upon completion of the flight evaluations, the Test Activity recommended Bell&#x27;s Huey Cobra to be an interim armed helicopter until the Cheyenne was fielded. On 13 April 1966, the U.S. Army awarded Bell Helicopter Company a production contract for 110 AH-1G Cobras. The Cobra had a tandem cockpit seating arrangement (vs UH-1 side-by-side) to make the aircraft a smaller frontal target, increased armor protection, and greater speed.
In 1967, the first AH-1Gs were deployed to Vietnam, around the same time that the Cheyenne successfully completed its first flight and initial flight evaluations. And while the Cheyenne program suffered setbacks over the next few years due to technical problems, the Cobra was establishing itself as an effective aerial weapons platform, despite its performance shortcomings compared to the AH-56 and design issues of its own. The cost estimates of the AH-56 increased substantially. By 1972, when the Cheyenne program was eventually cancelled to make way for the Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH), the interim AH-1 &quot;Snake&quot; had built a solid reputation as an attack helicopter. In June 1972 the USMC began deploying AH-1J SeaCobra Attack Helicopters for combat operations in South Vietnam.

During the late 1970s, the U.S. Army saw the need of more sophistication within the attack helicopter corps, allowing them to operate in all weather conditions. Although AH-1Gs served well, they proved vulnerable even in a mid-intensity environment. With that the Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) program started, aiming for a more durable, more advanced, longer range, stronger close air support helicopter, capable of destroying armored formations. It would be capable of carrying the new AGM-114 Hellfire and night fighting capabilities. From this program the Hughes YAH-64 came out as the winner. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the Bell YAH-63 in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, McDonnell Douglas continued and turned it into the AH-64 Apache production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986.

Today, the US attack helicopter has been further refined, and the AH-64D Apache Longbow demonstrates many of the advanced technologies being considered for deployment on future gunships. The US Marine Corps also continued to employ attack helicopters in the direct fire support role, in the form of the AH-1 Super Cobra. While helicopters were effective tank-killers in the Middle East, attack helicopters are being seen more in a multipurpose role. Tactics, such as tank plinking, showed that fixed-wing aircraft could be effective against tanks, but helicopters retained a unique low-altitude, low-speed capability for close air support. Other purpose-built helicopters were developed for special operations missions, including the MH-6 for extremely close support.

=== Soviet Union and its successor states ===
During the early 1960s, Soviet engineers started experimenting with various designs aimed at producing an aerial vehicle that could provide battlefield mobility for infantry and provide fire support to army forces on the ground. The first of these concepts was a mock-up unveiled in 1966 in the experimental shop of the Ministry of Aircraft&#x27;s factory number 329, where Mikhail Leont&#x27;yevich Mil was head designer. The mock-up, which was designated V-24, was based on another project, the V-22 utility helicopter, which itself never entered production. The V-24 had an infantry transport compartment that could hold eight troops sitting back to back, and a set of small wings positioned to the top rear of the passenger cabin, capable of holding up to six missiles or rocket pods, along with a twin-barrel GSh-23L cannon fixed to the landing skid.

These designs were proposed by Mil to the Soviet armed forces, and while he had the support of a number of strategists, he was opposed by several more senior members of the armed forces who believed that conventional weapons were a better use of resources. Despite the opposition, Mil managed to persuade the defence minister&#x27;s first deputy, Marshal Andrey A. Grechko, to convene an expert panel to look into the matter. While the panel&#x27;s opinions were mixed, supporters of the project eventually held sway and a request for design proposals for a battlefield support helicopter was issued.

The development of gunships and attack helicopters by the US Army during the Vietnam War convinced the Soviets of the advantages of armed helicopter ground support doctrine, which had a positive influence on moving forward with the development of the Mil Mi-24. After several mock-ups were produced, a directive was issued on 6 May 1968 to proceed with development of a twin-engine design of the helicopter. Work proceeded under Mil until his death in 1970. Detailed design work began in August 1968 under the codename Yellow 24. A full-scale mock-up of the design was reviewed and approved in February 1969. Flight tests with a prototype began on 15 September 1969 with a tethered hover, and four days later the first free flight was conducted. A second prototype was built, followed by a test batch of ten helicopters. A number of other design changes were made until the production version Mi-24A entered production in 1970, obtaining its initial operating capability in 1971 and was officially accepted into the state arsenal in 1972. Numerous versions have been developed to this day.

In 1972, following completion of the Mi-24, development began on a unique attack helicopter with transport capability. The new design had a reduced transport capability (3 troops instead of 8) and was called the Mil Mi-28.
In 1977, a preliminary design of the Mil Mi-28 was chosen, in a classic single-rotor layout. Its transport capability was removed and it lost its similarity to the Mi-24. Design work on the Mi-28 began under Marat Tishchenko in 1980. In 1981, a design and a mock-up were accepted. The prototype (no. 012) was first flown on 10 November 1982. In this same time frame, Kamov was also attempting to submit its own designs for a new helicopter to the military, which they had designed throughout the early and mid 1980s. In 1984, the Mi-28 completed the first stage of state trials, but in October 1984 the Soviet Air Force chose the more advanced Kamov Ka-50 as the new anti-tank helicopter. The Mi-28 development was continued, but given lower priority. In December 1987 Mi-28 production in Rosvertol in Rostov-on-Don was approved. After several prototypes were built, production ceased in 1993 with additional development continuing into the 21st century. Changes in the military situation after the Cold War made specialized anti-tank helicopters less useful. The advantages of the Mi-28N, like all-weather action ability, lower cost, and similarity to the Mi-24, have become more important. In 2003, the head of Russian Air Force stated that the Mi-28N and Ka-50 attack helicopters will become the standard Russian attack helicopter. The first serial Mi-28N was delivered to the Army on 5 June 2006.

=== China ===

In 1979, the Chinese military studied the problem of countering large armor formations. It concluded that the best conventional solution was to use attack helicopters. Eight Aérospatiale Gazelle armed with Euromissile HOT were procured for evaluation. By the mid-1980s, the Chinese decided a dedicated attack helicopter was required. At the time, they used civilian helicopters converted for the military; these were no longer adequate in the attack role, and suitable only as scouts. Following this, China evaluated the Agusta A129 Mangusta, and in 1988 secured an agreement with the US to purchase AH-1 Cobras and a license to produce BGM-71 TOW missiles; the latter was cancelled following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the resulting arms embargo. The color revolutions prevented the purchase of attack helicopters from Eastern Europe in 1990 and 1991; Bulgaria and Russia rejected Chinese offers to purchase the Mil Mi-24.

While attempting to import foreign designs failed, war games determined that attack helicopters had to be commanded by the army, rather than the air force. This led to the formation of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force Aircraft (PLAGFAF), with an initial strength of 9 Harbin Z-9s. The PLAGFAF conducted tactical experiments that would help define the future Z-10&#x27;s requirements. Research also decided that anti-tank missiles like the BGM-71 TOW were inadequate, and favored an analogue to the AGM-114 Hellfire.

The Gulf War highlighted the urgent need for attack helicopters, and revalidated the assessment that a purpose-built design was needed. (At the time, the Chinese military depended on armed utility helicopters such as the Changhe Z-11 and Harbin Z-9.) Also, it demonstrated that the new attack helicopter would need to be able to defend itself against other helicopters and aircraft. The military perceived that once the new attack helicopter entered service, the existing helicopters would be used as scouts.

The Armed Helicopter Developmental Work Team () was formed to develop a new medium helicopter design, as opposed to basing the new design on the light helicopters then in service. The 602nd and 608th Research Institutes started development of the 6-ton class China Medium Helicopter (CHM) program in 1994. The program was promoted as a civilian project, and was able to secure significant Western technical assistance, such as from Eurocopter (rotor installation design consultancy), Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada (PT6C turboshaft engine) and Agusta Westland (transmission). The Chinese concentrated on areas where it could not obtain foreign help. The 602nd Research Institute&#x27;s called its proposed armed helicopter design the Z-10 ().

The 602nd Research Institute was assigned as the chief designer, while Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation (HAMC) of China Aviation Industry Corporation II (AVIC II) was assigned as the primary manufacturer. Nearly four dozen other establishments participated in the program. According to Chinese sources, the initial test flights were concluded on December 17, 2003, whereas according to other sources they were completed nine months earlier in March 2003. According to Jane&#x27;s Information Group, a total of 3 prototypes had completed over 400 hours of test flights by this time. By 2004, 3 more prototypes were built, for a total of 6, and a second stage of test flights were concluded on December 15, 2004. In one of the test flights the future commander-in-chief of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force Air Force (PLAGAF), Song Xiangsheng (), was on board the prototype. A third stage of intensive test flights followed, taking place during both day and night. By January 2006 weaponry and sensor tests, including firing of live ammunition, had taken place. The helicopter was introduced to the general public in December 2010 and subsequently entered service with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

=== Italy ===
In 1972, the Italian Army began forming a requirement for a light observation and anti-tank helicopter. Agusta had initially studied the development of a combat-orientated derivative of their existing A109 helicopter, however they decided to proceed with the development of a more ambitious helicopter design. In 1978, Agusta formally began the design process on what would become the Agusta A129 Mangusta. On 11 September 1983, the first of five A129 prototypes made the type&#x27;s maiden flight; the fifth prototype would first fly in March 1986. The Italian Army placed an order for 60 A129s.

The A129 was the first European attack helicopter; as such it has several original aspects to its design, such as being the first helicopter to make use of a fully computerised integrated management system to reduce crew workload. It was decided that much of the helicopter&#x27;s functionality was to be automated; as such, parts of the flight and armament systems are monitored and directly controlled by onboard computers. The A129 shares considerable design similarities to Agusta&#x27;s earlier A109 utility helicopter; the rear section of the A129 was derived from the A109 and incorporated to an entirely new forward section. The A129&#x27;s fuselage is highly angular and armoured for ballistic protection; the composite rotor blades are also able to withstand hits from 23mm cannon fire. The two man crew, comprising a pilot and gunner, sit in a conventional tandem cockpit.

During the 1980s, Agusta sought to partner with Westland Helicopters to develop a common light attack helicopter, other prospective manufacturing participants in the joint initiative included Fokker and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA. In 1986, the governments of Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom signed a memorandum of understanding to investigate an improved version of the A129, alternatively called the Joint European Helicopter Tonal or &quot;Light Attack Helicopter&quot; (LAH). By 1988, feasibility studies for four different options had been conducted for the LAH, these would have between 80 per cent and 20 per cent growth over the initial A129; both single-engine and twin-engine configurations were examined using various new powerplants, as well as a new rotor system, retractable landing gear, improved sensors and more powerful armament. However, the LAH project collapsed in 1990 following Britain and the Netherlands independently deciding to withdraw from the program and eventually procure the AH-64 Apache instead.

Turkey had sought a new attack helicopter since the 1990s to replace their diminished Bell AH-1 Cobra and Bell AH-1 SuperCobra fleets. Following a highly protracted selection process, in September 2007, an order was issued for 51 TAI/AgustaWestland T129 ATAK helicopters, a variant of the A129 International. As a part of the deal with AgustaWestland, Turkish defense firm TAI acquired the rights for future manufacturing of the T129; TAI intends to produce the T129 for export customers. Various components and avionics systems are intended to be replaced with indigenously-produced systems as they are developed.

=== France, Germany and Spain ===
In 1984, the French and West German governments issued a requirement for an advanced multirole battlefield helicopter. A joint venture consisting of Aérospatiale and MBB was subsequently chosen as the preferred supplier. According to statements by the French Defence Minister André Giraud in April 1986, the collaborative effort had become more expensive than an individual national programme and was forecast to take longer to complete as well. In July 1986, a government report into the project alleged that the development had become distanced from the requirements and preferences of the military customers the Tiger was being developed for.

Both France and Germany reorganised the programme. Thomson-CSF also took over the majority of the Tiger&#x27;s electronic development work, such as the visual systems and sensors. Despite the early development problems and the political uncertainty between 1984 and 1986, the program was formally relaunched in November 1987; it was at this point that a greater emphasis on the attack helicopter&#x27;s anti-tank capabilities came about. Much of the project&#x27;s organisational framework was rapidly redeveloped between 1987 and 1989; such as the installation of a Franco-German Helicopter Office to act as a program executive agency in May 1989.
Due to the end of the Cold War and subsequent defence budgets decreases in the 1990s, financial pressures led to further questions regarding the necessity for the entire program. In 1992, Aérospatiale and MBB, among other companies, merged to form the Eurocopter Group; this led to considerable consolidation of the aerospace industry and the Tiger project itself. A major agreement was struck in December 1996 between France and Germany that cemented the Tiger&#x27;s prospects and committed the development of supporting elements, such as a series of new generation missile designs for use by the new combat helicopter.

On 18 June 1999, both Germany and France publicly placed orders for an initial batch of 160 Tiger helicopters, 80 for each nation, valued at €3.3 billion. On 22 March 2002, the first production Tiger was rolled out in a large ceremony held at Eurocopter&#x27;s Donauworth factory; although production models began initial acceptance trials in 2003, the first official delivery to the French Army took place on 18 March 2005; the first official Tiger delivery to the Germany followed on 6 April 2005. Germany reduced its order to 57 in March 2013. In 2008 OCCAR estimated the project cost at . France&#x27;s FY2012 budget put their share of the project at €6.3bn (~US$8.5bn), implying a programme cost of €14.5bn (~US$19.5bn) to the three main partners. At FY2012 prices, their 40 HAP cost €27m/unit (~US$36m) and their 40 HAD €35.6m/unit (~US$48m), including development costs the French Tigers cost €78.8m (~US$106m) each.

=== South Africa ===
The Rooivalk project began in early 1984 under the auspices of the Atlas Aircraft Corporation, a predecessor of Denel Aviation. Faced with the increasingly conventional nature of the South African Border War, the South African Defence Force recognised the need for a dedicated attack helicopter and accordingly set along the process of developing a suitable aircraft.

The Atlas XH-1 Alpha was the first prototype to emerge from the program. It was developed from an Aérospatiale Alouette III airframe, retaining that helicopter&#x27;s engine and dynamic components, but replacing the original cockpit with a stepped tandem one, adding a 20 mm cannon on the nose and converting the undercarriage to tail-dragger configuration. The XH-1 first flew on 3 February 1985. The results were ultimately good enough to convince Atlas and the SAAF that the concept was feasible, opening the door for the development of the Rooivalk. During the Rooivalk&#x27;s development, it was decided to base the aircraft on the dynamic components of the Aérospatiale Super Puma, a larger and more powerful helicopter. These components were already used on the Atlas Oryx, a local upgrade and modification of the Aérospatiale Puma.

Unfortunately, the development of the Rooivalk continued until after the conclusion of the South African Border War and defence budgets were slashed due to parliamentary changes to the requirements of the national air force. This resulted in an extensive development and production period beginning in 1990 until 2007, during which 12 aircraft were produced for use by the South African Air Force. These aircraft were subsequently upgraded to the Block 1F standard by 2011. The upgrade involves improved targeting systems and other avionics which enable the helicopter to use guided missiles for the first time. The Mokopa ATGM was qualified as part of the upgrade process. Gearbox components were improved and cooling problems with the F2 20 mm cannon were also addressed.

On 1 April 2011, the South African Air Force received the first five of eleven (one of the twelve aircraft originally delivered to the SAAF was written off after an accident) Block 1F upgraded Rooivalk. The ninth and tenth Rooivalk attack helicopters were delivered in September 2012 following their upgrade to the Block 1F initial operating standard. The eleventh and final Rooivalk was delivered on 13 March 2013.

=== India ===
The Indian Army deploys the Mil Mi-35 (export variant of Mi-24V) and HAL Rudra as of 2014. During the Kargil War in 1999, the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army found that there was a need for helicopters that can operate at such high-altitude conditions with ease. Limitations in terms of both high payloads and maneuverability of the existing Mi-35 fleet reportedly contributed to India developing indigenous rotorcraft, such as the HAL Prachand and HAL Rudra, to perform multi-role high-altitude combat operations. The HAL Rudra was a modified version of HAL Dhruv, free of any major modifications to the airframe to quickly create an armed variant for the Indian Army.

The HAL Prachand is a purpose-built attack helicopter, expressly designed to overcome several operational shortcomings of prior attack rotorcraft. By 2010, the Indian Air Force was reportedly set to acquire 65 LCHs while the Indian Army&#x27;s Aviation Corps was to also procure 114 LCHs for its own purposes. During February 2020, the LCH was declared ready for production, the final assembly line has been established at HAL&#x27;s Helicopter Division in Bangalore. Prime minister Narendra Modi conducted the handover ceremony of HAL Prachand to the Indian Armed forces in Jhansi.

==Operations==
The Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s saw &quot;the most intensive use of the helicopters&quot; in a conventional war ever, as well as the only confirmed helicopter dogfights in history; in particular, Iranian Army Aviation AH-1J SeaCobras engaged with Mi-24 Hind and Mi-8 Hip helicopters of the Iraqi Army Air Corps. The Iranian Cobras also attacked advancing Iraqi divisions in conjunction with fixed-wing F-4 Phantoms armed with Maverick missiles, destroying numerous armoured vehicles and impeded the Iraqi advance, albeit not completely halting it.

The 1990s could be seen as the coming-of-age for the U.S. attack helicopter. The AH-64 Apache was used extensively during Operation Desert Storm with great success, being used to fire the first shots of the conflict, destroying Iraqi early warning radar and surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites with their Hellfire missiles. They were later used successfully in both of their operational roles, to direct attack against enemy armor and as aerial artillery in support of ground troops; both Hellfire missile and cannon attacks by Apaches destroyed numerous enemy tanks and armored cars. General Carl Stiner claimed that: &quot;You could fire that Hellfire missile through a window from four miles [] away at night.&quot; However, serious logistical problems limited operations, Apaches in the Iraqi theater flew only one-fifth of planned flight-hours.
The &quot;deep attack&quot; role of independently operating attack helicopters came into question after a failed mission, during the 2003 Gulf War attack on the Karbala Gap. A second mission in the same area, four days later, but coordinated with artillery and fixed-wing aircraft, was more successful with minimal losses. In October 2014, U.S. Army AH-64s and Air Force fighters participated in four air strikes on Islamic State units northeast of Fallujah. In June 2016, Apaches were used in support of the Iraqi Army&#x27;s Mosul offensive and provided support during the Battle of Mosul, sometimes flying night missions supporting Iraqi operations.

In 2011, France and Britain sent Eurocopter Tiger and AgustaWestland Apache attack helicopters to Libya. The primary objective of the 2011 military intervention was to protect civilians in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1973. Within days of the Apaches deployment, it had completed a variety of tasks such as destroying tanks, checkpoints held by pro-Gaddafi forces and vehicles carrying ammunitions loyal to Muammar Gaddafi. Apache operations over Libya have been heavily influenced and supported by NATO reconnaissance flights and intelligence missions; information was continually relayed to update target information, assess the threat of Surface to Air missiles (SAM), and the presence of civilians, enabling real time changes to missions.
In 2013, the South African National Defence Force announced that it would deploy Denel Rooivalk attack helicopters to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to support the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This was the first combat deployment for the helicopter. Three helicopters from 16 Squadron SAAF were deployed to the region and since November 2013 it was involved in heavy fighting alongside the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade, against rebels operating in North Kivu, in particular the M23 militia, which consisted of hardened former government troops equipped with relatively heavy weaponry such as main battle tanks and anti-aircraft weaponry. During its first ever combat mission it proved to be instrumental in routing the rebels from their hilltop strongholds during an offensive by the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade and the Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<doc id="543454" wikidata="Q1193297" url="?curid=543454" title="Indian epic poetry">
<text>Indian epic poetry is the epic poetry written in the Indian subcontinent, traditionally called Kavya (or &quot;Kāvya&quot;; Sanskrit: काव्य, IAST: &quot;kāvyá&quot;). The &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, which were originally composed in Sanskrit and later translated into many other Indian languages, and the Five Great Epics of Tamil literature and Sangam literature are some of the oldest surviving epic poems ever written.
== List of longest epics==

== Hindi epics ==
In modern Hindi literature, &quot;Kamayani&quot; by Jaishankar Prasad has attained the status of an epic. The narrative of Kamayani is based on a popular mythological story, first mentioned in Satapatha Brahmana. It is a story of the great flood and the central characters of the epic poem are Manu (a male) and Shraddha (a female). Manu is representative of the human psyche and Shradha represents love. Another female character is Ida, who represents rationality. Some critics surmise that the three lead characters of Kamayani symbolize a synthesis of knowledge, action and desires in human life. It inspires humans to live a life based on &quot;karm&quot; and not on fortunes.

Apart from &quot;Kamayani&quot;, &quot;Saketa&quot; (1932) by Maithili Sharan Gupt, &quot;Kurukshetra (Epic Poetry)&quot; (1946), &quot;Rashmirathi&quot; (1952) and &quot;Urvashi&quot; (1961) by Ramdhari Singh &#x27;Dinkar&#x27; have attained the status of epic poetry.

Likewise &quot;Lalita Ke Aansoo&quot; by Krant M. L. Verma (1978) narrates the tragic story about the death of Lal Bahadur Shastri through his wife Lalita Shastri.

== Kannada epics ==
Kannada epic poetry mainly consists of Jain religious literature and Lingayat literature. Asaga wrote &quot;Vardhaman Charitra&quot;, an epic which runs in 18 cantos, in 853 CE, the first Sanskrit biography of the 24th and last tirthankara of Jainism, Mahavira, though his Kannada-language version of Kalidasa&#x27;s epic poem, &quot;Kumārasambhava&quot;, &quot;Karnataka Kumarasambhava Kavya&quot; is lost. The most famous poet from this period is Pampa (902-975 CE), one of the most famous writers in the Kannada language. His &quot;Vikramarjuna Vijaya&quot; (also called the &quot;Pampabharatha&quot;) is hailed as a classic even to this day. With this and his other important work Ādi purāṇa he set a trend of poetic excellence for the Kannada poets of the future. The former work is an adaptation of the celebrated Mahabharata, and is the first such adaptation in Kannada. Noted for the strong human bent and the dignified style in his writing, Pampa has been one of the most influential writers in Kannada. He is identified as &quot;Adikavi&quot; &quot;first poet&quot;. It is only in Kannada that we have a Ramayana and a Mahabharata based on the Jain tradition in addition to those based on Brahmanical tradition.

Shivakotiacharya was the first writer in prose style. His work Vaddaradhane is dated to 900 CE. Sri Ponna (939-966 CE) is also an important writer from the same period, with &quot;Shanti Purana&quot; as his magnum opus. Another major writer of the period is &quot;Ranna&quot; (949-? CE). His most famous works are the Jain religious work &quot;Ajita Tirthankara Purana&quot; and the Gada Yuddha, a birds&#x27; eye view of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; set in the last day of the battle of Kurukshetra and relating the story of the Mahabharata through a series of flashbacks. Structurally, the poetry in this period is in the &quot;Champu&quot; style, essentially poetry interspersed with lyrical prose.

The &quot;Siribhoovalaya&quot; is a unique work of multilingual Kannada literature written by Kumudendu Muni, a Jain monk. The work is unique in that it does not employ letters, but is composed entirely in Kannada numerals. The &quot;Saangathya&quot; metre of Kannada poetry is employed in the work. It uses numerals 1 through 64 and employs various patterns or &quot;bandhas&quot; in a frame of 729 (27×27) squares to represent letters in nearly 18 scripts and over 700 languages. Some of the patterns used include the &quot;Chakrabandha&quot;, &quot;Hamsabandha&quot;, &quot;Varapadmabandha&quot;, &quot;Sagarabandha&quot;, &quot;Sarasabandha&quot;, &quot;Kruanchabandha&quot;, &quot;Mayurabandha&quot;, &quot;Ramapadabandha&quot;, and &quot;Nakhabandha&quot;. As each of these patterns are identified and decoded, the contents can be read. The work is said to have around 600,000 verses, nearly six times as big as the ancient Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

The &quot;Prabhulingaleele&quot;, &quot;Basava purana&quot;, &quot;Channabasavapurana&quot; and &quot;Basavarajavijaya&quot; are a few of the Lingayat epics.

== Meitei epics ==


Meitei language (officially known as Manipuri language), an old Sino-Tibetan language, originated from Ancient Kangleipak (early Manipur) in North East India, is a language with a rich granary of epic poetries, mostly written in archaic version of the Meitei script in Puyas, the Meitei texts.

The sagas of the seven epic cycles of incarnations of the two divine lovers were originated from the shoreline Moirang around the Loktak lake in Manipur. Their stories were composed in both prose and poetry, among which the ballad versions were usually sung by the minstrels, playing Pena (musical instrument) since ancient times.

The &quot;Khamba Thoibi Sheireng&quot; (based on the story of Khamba and Thoibi) is regarded as the greatest of all the Meitei epics. It is regarded as the national epic of the Manipuris. It consists of approximately 39,000 verses. The epic poetry has fifteen chapters () and ninety two sections (). It is based on the legendary love story of Khuman Khamba, an orphan man, and Thoibi, the then princess of Moirang. Though the legend existed in the immortal songs of the Meitei balladeers, it was composed in a proper poetic version by Hijam Anganghal in 1940.

The &quot;Numit Kappa&quot;, literally meaning &quot;Shooting at the Sun&quot; in Meitei, is a 1st-century BC Meitei epic, based on the story of a hero named &quot;Khwai Nungjeng Piba&quot;, who shoots one of the two shining suns in the sky, to create the night.

The &quot;Ougri&quot; is the collection of musical epic poetries, associated with religious themes, originated during the reign of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in 33 AD. Other epics include &quot;Shingel Indu&quot; by Hijam Anganghal, &quot;Khongjom Tirtha&quot; by Nilabir Sharma, &quot;Chingoi Baruni&quot; by Gokul Shastri, &quot;Kansa Vadha&quot; by A. Dorendrajit, and &quot;Vasudeva Mahakavya&quot; by Chingangbam Kalachand.
However, the Sanskrit epics such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana were also translated into Meitei language in the medieval times.
Other translated epic works include the &quot;Meghnad Badh Kavya&quot;, the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, and the &quot;Ashtakam&quot;.

== Assamese epics ==

In 14th century Madhav Kandali dubbed the epic Ramayana as Saptakanda Ramayana. In chronology, among vernacular translations of the original Sanskrit, Kandali&#x27;s Ramayana comes after Kamban&#x27;s (Tamil, 12th century)and Gona Budda Reddy&#x27;s ( Telugu: Ranganath Ramayanamu) and ahead of Kirttivas&#x27; (Bengali, 15th century), Tulsidas&#x27; (Awadhi, 16th century), Balaram Das&#x27; (Oriya) etc. Thus it becomes the first rendition of the Ramayana into an Indo-Aryan language in the Indian subcontinent.

== Sanskrit epics ==
The ancient Sanskrit epics the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot; comprise together the Itihāsa () or Mahākāvya (&quot;Great Compositions&quot;), a of Hindu scripture. The epic form prevailed and verse remained, until very recently, the preferred form of Hindu literary works. Indian culture readily lent itself to a literary tradition that abounded in epic poetry and literature. The Puranas, a massive collection of verse-form histories of India&#x27;s many Hindu gods and goddesses, followed in this tradition. Itihāsa and Puranas are mentioned in the Atharva Veda and referred to as the &quot;fifth Veda&quot;.

The language of these texts, termed &quot;Epic Sanskrit&quot;, constitutes the earliest phase of Classical Sanskrit, following the latest stage of Vedic Sanskrit found in the Shrauta Sutras. The &quot;Suparṇākhyāna&quot;, a late Vedic poem considered to be among the &quot;earliest traces of epic poetry in India,&quot; is an older, shorter precursor to the expanded legend of Garuda that is included within the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;.

The Buddhist kavi Aśvaghoṣa wrote two epics and one drama. He lived in the 1st-2nd century. He wrote a biography of the Buddha, titled Buddhacarita. His second epic is called Saundarananda and tells the story of the conversion of Nanda, the younger brother of the Buddha. The play he wrote is called Śariputraprakaraṇa, but of this play only a few fragments remained.

The famous poet and playwright Kālidāsa also wrote two epics: &quot;Raghuvamsha&quot; (&quot;The Dynasty of Raghu&quot;) and &quot;Kumarasambhava&quot; (&quot;The Birth of Kumar Kartikeya&quot;). Other classical Sanskrit epics are the &quot;Slaying of Śiśupāla&quot; &quot;Śiśupālavadha&quot; of Māgha, &quot;Arjuna and the Mountain Man&quot; &quot;Kirātārjunīya&quot; of Bhāravi, the &quot;Adventures of the Prince of Nishadha&quot; &quot;Naiṣadhacarita&quot; of Śrīharṣa and &quot;Bhaṭṭi&#x27;s Poem&quot; &quot;Bhaṭṭikāvya&quot; of Bhaṭṭi.

== Tamil epics ==

The post-sangam period (2nd century-6th century) saw many great Tamil epics being written, including &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; (or &quot;Silappadhikaram&quot;), &quot;Manimegalai&quot;, &quot;Civaka Cintamani&quot;, &quot;Valayapathi&quot; and &quot;Kundalakesi&quot;. Out of the five, &quot;Manimegalai&quot; and &quot;Kundalakesi&quot; are Buddhist religious works, &quot;Civaka Cintamani&quot; and &quot;Valayapathi&quot; are Tamil Jain works and &quot;Silappatikaram&quot; has a neutral religious view. They were written over a period of 1st century CE to 10th century CE and act as the historical evidence of social, religious, cultural and academic life of people during the era they were created. &quot;Civaka Cintamani&quot; introduced long verses called &quot;virutha pa&quot; in Tamil literature, while &quot;Silappatikaram&quot; used &quot;akaval&quot; meter (monologue), a style adopted from Sangam literature.

Later, during the Chola period, Kamban (12th century) wrote what is considered one of the greatest Tamil epics — the &quot;Kamba Ramayanam&quot; of Kamban, based on the Valmiki Ramayana. The Thiruthondat Puranam (or Periya Puranam) of Chekkizhar is the great Tamil epic of the Shaiva Bhakti saints and is part of the religious scripture of Tamil Nadu&#x27;s majority Shaivites.

== Telugu epics ==
Most of the Telugu epics are about Hinduism.

The first known Telugu epic was the Andhra Mahabharatam written by the Kavitrayam (11th-14th centuries)

Other main Telugu epics are the Ranganatha Ramayanamu, Basava Purana, and the Amuktamalyada

<doc id="543459" wikidata="Q5695903" url="?curid=543459" title="Hebrew and Jewish epic poetry">
<text>Biblical poetry such as the Song of the Sea and the Song of Deborah may be considered early examples of Jewish epic poetry, though very short by normal epic standards. Both songs are compared by scholars to Canaanite and Assyrian epic poetry.

There are a few medieval and later works, some translations or adaptations of works in other languages, and other adaptations of Biblical material. It is fair to say that few of these achieved very wide or lasting fame, even within the Jewish community. The most lasting were composed in Yiddish. It has been argued that Jewish attitudes discouraged the promotion of hero figures, generally a feature of the epic form. It has also been argued that few if any of the works mentioned below are truly epic, if only on the grounds of length.

==Antiquity==
Ezekiel the Tragedian was a Jewish dramatist who lived, according to some scholars, in the 3rd century BC Alexandria, and who wrote the five-act epic drama &quot;Exagōgē&quot;. It&#x27;s written in iambic trimeter, retelling of the biblical story of The Exodus from Egypt. Moses is the main character of the play, and parts of the biblical story have been altered to suit the narrative&#x27;s needs. This drama is unique in blending the biblical story with the Hellenistic tragic drama. Although it survives only in fragments found in the writings of Eusebius, Clement of Alexandria, and Pseudo-Eustathius, the extensive quotations by these writers make possible the assembly of 269 lines of text, about 20-25% of the whole.

==Middle Ages==
Two medieval Jewish communities are notable for producing their own epic works: the Iranian and Ashkenazi Jews. According to Vera Basch Moreen, Judeo-Persian literature is the product of the confluence of two mighty literary and religious streams, the Jewish Biblical and post-Biblical heritage and the Persian literary legacy. Examples of Jewish-Persian Biblical-themed epic poems include 14th century &quot;Mūsā-nāmeh&quot;, &quot;Ezra-nāmeh&quot; and &quot;Bereshit-nāmeh&quot; by Maulānā Shāhīn; &quot;Fatḥ-nāmeh&quot; and &quot;Ḥanukā-nāma&quot; by ʿEmrāni (15th century).

14th-16th century Ashkenazi Yiddish epic poems may be divided into 2 major categories: Jewish-themed compositions fusing Biblical and Midrashic material influenced by Germanic epics, especially The Song of the Nibelungs, and Jewish-flavored variants of Arthurian, German and Middle English epics. The first category includes Shmuel-Bukh, a midrashic verse epic characterized by Sol Liptzin as the greatest Old Yiddish religious epic, and Mlokhim-Bukh (&quot;The Book of Kings&quot;), which fuses Biblical material, Midrashic legends, and rabbinical folklore with European chivalric poetry. Both works, strongly resembling the Nibelungenlied, inspired a series of other Yiddish epic poems.

The second category includes Dukus Horant, a heroic epic in Judeo-German (Proto-Yiddish) with thematic similarities to the German poem Kudrun found in the earliest Yiddish literary manuscript from 1384. In the early 16th century Elia Levita published his Bovo-Bukh, a Yiddish version of Sir Bevis of Hampton. Some characters in Levita&#x27;s work were turned by the author&#x27;s into Jews; the book remained the most popular chivalric romance in Yiddish up until the 19th century. Another example of once popular epic is Vidvilt or Kinig Artis houf, a Yiddish version of the Middle High German epic Wigalois. Despite the fact that the contents of such works are unrelated to Jews, they were perceived by the Ashkenazi Jews as an integral part of their cultural and literary tradition.

==Modern Jewish Epics==

Isidore Singer, the managing editor of the early 20th century Jewish Encyclopedia, argued that though an abundance of historical reminiscence and legend lay in the storehouse of Jewish literature, none of it was built into epic poems until relatively recently. Religious and secular poets often treated of such subjects as Abraham and Isaac and the near sacrifice of Isaac on Mount Moriah, Jacob and Joseph and the story of their lives, Moses and Aaron and the departure from Egypt, Joshua and the entrance into Canaan, Jeremiah and the fall of Jerusalem, Elijah the Prophet, etc. These, however, are often considered only poems with an epic coloring. Singer claimed that a &quot;pure epic poem according to the rules of art&quot; was not produced during the Middle Ages.

According to Singer, &quot;the stern character of Jewish monotheism prevented the rise of hero-worship, without which real epic poetry is impossible&quot;. Subsequent research refuted most of Isidore Singer&#x27;s assumptions on the subject as antiquated misconceptions. It&#x27;s worth to mention that several European epic poems, including The Song of Roland, The Lay of the Cid and The Song of the Nibelungs were produced in Christian societies, which also &quot;prevented the rise of hero-worship&quot; while encouraging veneration and glorification of heroes and saints. Similarly, the Muslim culture of Iran did not prevent Ferdowsi from writing his Shahnameh, which inspired numerous Persian-Jewish epic poems. Both Judeo-Persian and Ashkenazi tradition of epic poetry continued to flourish and develop in the 17th century.

In the 16th century, the Kabbalist rabbi Mordecai ben Judah Dato wrote the epic &quot;Istoria di Ester&quot; (Story of Esther) composed in ottava rima. A Portuguese converso poet, Miguel de Silveyra (c. 1578–1638), composed a Spanish baroque epic El Macabeo (The Maccabean).

Antonio Enríquez Gómez, a Spanish crypto-Jew, was one of the first Jewish modern epic authors who wrote (&quot;Sansón Nazareno: Poema heróico&quot;, a Spanish-language heroic epic version of the Samson story), followed closely by Solomon de Oliveira&#x27;s epic (&quot;Elat Ahabim,&quot; Amsterdam, 1665). One of the first modern Jewish epic poets was N. H. Wessely with his Moses-themes &quot;Shire Tif&#x27;eret&quot; (Berlin, 1789–1802), an epic on the Exodus from Egypt. According to Isidore Singer, the influence of a similar work by the German poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock on is evident. Next to him stands Shalom Kohn with his &quot;Ner David&quot;, an epic poem on King David (Vienna, 1834). The influence of these two epics on the readers and poets of that time was considerable.

In addition the following poets may be mentioned from that and the succeeding period: Issachar Bär Schlesinger (&quot;Ha-Ḥashmona&#x27;im,&quot; Prague, 1817); Samuel Molder (&quot;Beruriya,&quot; Amsterdam, 1825); Süsskind Raschkow (&quot;Ḥayye Shimshon,&quot; Breslau, 1824); Gabriel Pollak (&quot;Ha-Keritot,&quot; Amsterdam, 1834, and &quot;Ḳiḳayon le-Yonah,&quot; ib. 1853); and Hirsch Wassertrilling (&quot;Hadrat Elisha&#x27;,&quot; Breslau, 1857, and &quot;Nezer Ḥamodot,&quot; ib. 1860). Works of this sort have been written by M. I. Lebensohn, Judah Leib Gordon (&quot;Ahavat David u-Mikal&quot;, Wilna, 1856, and vols. iii. and iv. of his collected works, St. Petersburg, 1883), Chaim N. Bialik, and S. Tschernichowski.
