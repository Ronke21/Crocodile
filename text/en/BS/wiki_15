<text>Sleeping Giant (also known as the Blue Hills and Mount Carmel), (&quot;Hobbomock&quot; in Quinnipiac), is a rugged traprock mountain with a high point of , located north of New Haven, Connecticut. A prominent landscape feature visible for miles, the Sleeping Giant receives its name from its anthropomorphic resemblance to a slumbering human figure as seen from either the north or south. The Giant is known for its expansive clifftop vistas, rugged topography, and microclimate ecosystems. Most of the Giant is located within Sleeping Giant State Park. The mountain is a popular recreation site: over of hiking trails traverse it including of the Quinnipiac Trail. Quinnipiac University is located at Mount Carmel&#x27;s foot in Hamden.

==Geography==
The Sleeping Giant, long by wide, is located in Hamden with its eastern edge falling into Wallingford. The Giant&#x27;s profile features distinct &quot;head,&quot; &quot;chin,&quot; &quot;chest,&quot; &quot;hip,&quot; &quot;knee,&quot; and &quot;feet&quot; sections topographically represented by traprock outcrops and ridge crests. The highest point is the Left Hip, , followed by the Chest, , and the Left Knee and Right Leg, each, and so on. The Giant&#x27;s Head, , is marked by a cliff. A stone observation tower located on the Left Hip, built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s, offers 360° views of the surrounding Mill and Quinnipiac River valleys. An old rock quarry, closed since 1933 and now part of the state park, has left scars on the Giant&#x27;s Head. 
It is part of the narrow, linear Metacomet Ridge that extends from Long Island Sound north through the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts to the Vermont border. The Metacomet Ridge extends west and south from Sleeping Giant as Rocky Top and West Rock Ridge. The west side of Sleeping Giant drains into the Mill River thence to New Haven Harbor and Long Island Sound; the east side into the Quinnipiac River, thence to New Haven Harbor and Long Island Sound.

==Geology==

Sleeping Giant, a fault-block ridge that formed 200 million years ago during the Triassic and Jurassic periods, is composed of traprock, also known as basalt, an extrusive volcanic rock. Minor earthquakes have also been measured by seismographs and reported by residents. Basalt is a dark colored rock, but the iron within it weathers to a rusty brown when exposed to the air, lending the ledges a distinct reddish appearance. Basalt frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique &quot;postpile&quot; appearance. Huge slopes made of fractured basalt scree are visible beneath many of the ledges of Sleeping Giant. The basalt cliffs are the product of several massive lava flows hundreds of feet deep that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia and Africa. These basalt floods of lava happened over a period of 20 million years. Erosion occurring between the eruptions deposited deep layers of sediment between the lava flows, which eventually lithified into sedimentary rock. The resulting &quot;layer cake&quot; of basalt and sedimentary sheets eventually faulted and tilted upward. Subsequent erosion wore away the weaker sedimentary layers at a faster rate than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today. One way to imagine this is to picture a layer cake tilted slightly up with some of the frosting (the sedimentary layer) removed in between.

==Ecosystem==
Sleeping Giant hosts a combination of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak and a variety of understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Lower eastern slopes tend to support oak-hickory forest species common in the surrounding lowlands. Narrow ravines crowded with eastern hemlock block sunlight, creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in eastern Connecticut. Because the ridge generates such varied terrain, it is the home of several plant and animal species that are state-listed or globally rare. Sleeping Giant is also an important seasonal raptor migration path.

==Mythology==
According to Native Americans of the Quinnipiac Tribe, the giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent wicked figure in many stories (see Pocumtuck Ridge and Quinnipiac), became enraged about the mistreatment of his people and stamped his foot down in anger, diverting the course of the Connecticut River (where the river suddenly swings east in Middletown, Connecticut after several hundred miles of running due south). To prevent him from wreaking such havoc in the future, the good spirit Keitan cast a spell on Hobbomock to sleep forever as the prominent man-like form of the Sleeping Giant.

In the title story of Eleanor Estes&#x27;s 1948 collection, &quot;The Sleeping Giant and Other Stories&quot;, the Giant decides to get up and leave. The Native American legend is retold (with a few liberties) by Jason J. Marchi in his illustrated children&#x27;s book &quot;The Legend of Hobbomock: The Sleeping Giant&quot;, published in 2015.

==History==
During the mid-19th century, spurred by the painters of the Hudson River School and transcendentalist philosophers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, an interest in mountains as a respite from industrialization and urbanization took hold in New England. Summer cottages were built on the Sleeping Giant and many other locations on the Metacomet Ridge. In 1888, John H. Dickerman built a carriage road on the Giant and opened what he called &quot;Blue Hills Park.&quot; He held picnics with ice cream on the ledges for local residents.

Conservation of the Giant began in 1924 with the creation of the Sleeping Giant Park Association (SGPA) by a group of local residents concerned with ongoing traprock quarrying on the Giant&#x27;s head. A cottage owner, Judge Willis Cook, had leased his property to the Mount Carmel Traprock Company for the purpose of quarrying traprock for building materials. The blasting away of what was a beloved landscape feature resulted in public outrage, well reported by local newspapers at the time. Under the leadership of James W. Toumey, a Yale University forestry professor, the SGPA undertook a ten-year struggle with the traprock operation. The property was purchased by the SGPA in 1933, during the Great Depression, for $30,000; the money was raised through private donations and the property became the Sleeping Giant State Park.

Sleeping Giant State Park was created in 1924, when the SGPA donated 600 acres to the Park and Forest Commission. The state added an additional 65 acres that year, purchased at a cost of $7025.00.

In 1936, the Sleeping Giant Tower was built at the top by the Works Progress Administration. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 as part of the Connecticut State Park and Forest Depression-Era Federal Work Relief Programs Structures.

On May 15, 2018, a 100-mph microburst caused extensive damage to the park, forcing its closure. Ben Lambert of the New Haven Register noted that, &quot;The tops of trees around the park entrance looked as if they had been purposefully shorn away.&quot; After more than a year of clean up, largely in part by the Sleeping Giant Park Association, the park reopened on June 14, 2019. According to the Hartford Courant, officials from the state estimated restoration cost $735,000.

==Recreation==
Sleeping Giant State Park offers clifftop views of much of New Haven County, some of Hartford County and, atmospheric conditions permitting, across Long Island Sound to the Shoreham area on Long Island.

The state park is open until sunset year-round. Activities permitted on the Giant include hiking, rock climbing, snowshoeing, picnicking, bird watching, and other passive pursuits. Trails specifically designed for horseback riding and cross-country skiing are located on the lower reaches of the Giant, and fishing is allowed in the abutting Mill River. Rock climbing, closed on the Giant in 1953 because of accidents, was permitted as of 2015. Youth camping only is allowed on the Giant (by permit). Seasonal facilities include restrooms, a picnic shelter, and picnic tables. The Quinnipiac Trail—the oldest trail in the blue blazed trail system managed by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association—traverses the length of the Giant from the Quinnipiac River west over the Giant&#x27;s high points to the Mill River then continues north over West Rock Ridge and Mount Sanford.

==Conservation==
Most, but not all, of the Sleeping Giant has been conserved. The trails and facilities on Sleeping Giant are collaboratively maintained by the Sleeping Giant Park Association and the State of Connecticut, with the bulk of the trail maintenance done by the association. Sleeping Giant State Park encompasses ; the SGPA remains active in securing additional parcels to add to the property. The SGPA has also been instrumental in defeating attempts to log the Giant, build communications towers on its summits, and close the state park altogether. SGPA runs a regular recreational and interpretive hikes on the Giant and volunteer trail maintenance programs. The Connecticut Forest and Park Association also has a working investment in the conservation of the Giant and trail building on it. The trail system of the park is also designated as a National Recreation Trail.

<doc id="537789" wikidata="Q259207" url="?curid=537789" title="Anatolian sub-plate">
<text>The Anatolian sub-plate is a continental tectonic plate that is separated from the Eurasian plate and the Arabian plate by the North Anatolian Fault and the East Anatolian Fault respectively. Most of the country of Turkey is located on the Anatolian plate. Most significant earthquakes in the region have historically occurred along the northern fault, such as the 1939 Erzincan earthquake. The devastating 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquakes occurred along the active East Anatolian Fault at a strike-slip fault where the Arabian plate is sliding past the Anatolian plate horizontally.

According to the American Museum of Natural History, the Anatolian transform fault system is &quot;probably the most active in the world&quot;. The East Anatolian Fault, a left lateral transform fault, forms a boundary with the Arabian plate. To the south and southwest is a convergent boundary with the African plate. This convergence manifests in compressive features within the oceanic crust beneath the Mediterranean as well as within the continental crust of Anatolia itself, and also by what are generally considered to be subduction zones along the Hellenic and Cyprus arcs. The northern edge is a transform boundary with the Eurasian plate, forming the North Anatolian Fault zone (NAFZ).

Research indicates that the Anatolian plate is rotating counterclockwise as it is being pushed west by the Arabian plate, impeded from any northerly movement by the Eurasian plate. In some references, the Anatolian plate is referred to as a &quot;block&quot; of continental crust still coupled to the Eurasian plate. But studies of the North Anatolian Fault indicate that Anatolia is de-coupled from the Eurasian plate. It is now being squeezed by the Arabian plate from the east and forced toward the west as the Eurasian plate to its north is blocking motion in that direction. The African plate is subducting beneath the Anatolian plate along the Cyprus and Hellenic Arcs offshore in the Mediterranean Sea.

<doc id="537792" wikidata="Q1130148" url="?curid=537792" title="Ketoacidosis">
<text>Ketoacidosis is a metabolic state caused by uncontrolled production of ketone bodies that cause a metabolic acidosis. While ketosis refers to any elevation of blood ketones, ketoacidosis is a specific pathologic condition that results in changes in blood pH and requires medical attention. The most common cause of ketoacidosis is diabetic ketoacidosis but it can also be caused by alcohol, medications, toxins, and rarely, starvation.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of ketoacidosis are variable depending on the underlying cause. The most common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and weakness. Breath may also develop the smell of acetone as it is a volatile ketone that can be exhaled. Rapid deep breathing, or Kussmaul breathing, may be present to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. Altered mental status is more common in diabetic than alcoholic ketoacidosis.

==Causes==
Ketoacidosis is caused by the uncontrolled production of ketone bodies. Usually the production of ketones is carefully controlled by several hormones, most importantly insulin. If the mechanisms that control ketone production fail, ketone levels may become dramatically elevated and cause dangerous changes in physiology such as a metabolic acidosis.

=== Diabetes ===
The most common cause of ketoacidosis is a deficiency of insulin in type 1 diabetes or late-stage type 2 diabetes. This is called diabetic ketoacidosis and is characterized by hyperglycemia, dehydration and metabolic acidosis. Other electrolyte disturbances such as hyperkalemia and hyponatremia may also be present. A lack of insulin in the bloodstream allows unregulated fatty acid release from adipose tissue which increases fatty acid oxidation to acetyl CoA, some of which is diverted to ketogenesis. This raises ketone levels significantly above what is seen in normal physiology.

=== Alcohol ===
Alcoholic ketoacidosis is caused by complex physiology that is usually the result of prolonged and heavy alcohol intake in the setting of poor nutrition. Chronic alcohol use can cause depleted hepatic glycogen stores and ethanol metabolism further impairs gluconeogenesis. This can reduce glucose availability and lead to hypoglycemia and increased reliance on fatty acid and ketone metabolism. An additional stressor such as vomiting or dehydration can cause an increase in counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, cortisol and growth hormone which may further increase free fatty acid release and ketone production. Ethanol metabolism can also increase blood lactic acid levels which may also contribute to a metabolic acidosis.

=== Starvation ===
Starvation is a rare cause of ketoacidosis, usually instead causing physiologic ketosis without ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis from starvation most commonly occurs in the setting of an additional metabolic stressor such as pregnancy, lactation, or acute illness.

=== Medications ===
Certain medications can also cause elevated ketones, such as SGLT2 inhibitors causing euglycemic ketoacidosis. Overdose of salicylates or isoniazid can also cause ketoacidosis.

=== Toxins ===
Ketoacidosis can be the result of ingestion of methanol, ethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, and acetone.

== Pathophysiology ==
Ketones are primarily produced from free fatty acids in the mitochondria of liver cells. The production of ketones is strongly regulated by insulin and an absolute or relative lack of insulin underlies the pathophysiology of ketoacidosis. Insulin is a potent inhibitor of fatty acid release, so insulin deficiency can cause an uncontrolled release of fatty acids from adipose tissue. Insulin deficiency can also enhance ketone production and inhibit peripheral use of ketones. This can occur during states of complete insulin deficiency (such as untreated diabetes) or relative insulin deficiency in states of elevated glucagon and counter-regulatory hormones (such as starvation, heavy chronic alcohol use or illness).

Acetoacetic acid and β-hydroxybutyrate are the most abundant circulating ketone bodies. Ketone bodies are acidic; however, at physiologic concentrations, the body&#x27;s acid/base buffering system prevents them from changing blood pH.
==Diagnosis==
Blood tests for the diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis measure glycemia (sugar level), pH (blood acidity), and ketone bodies. As urgent medical treatment is often required when DKA is suspected, the tentative diagnosis can be made based on clinical history and by calculating the anion gap from the basic metabolic panel, which would demonstrate a high anion-gap metabolic acidosis along with high glucose levels. This allows timely treatment with fluids and insulin well before direct serum ketone body testing results arrive. Urine ketone testing is also available but this cannot easily distinguish DKA from other causes of ketonuria without more context. 

Diagnostic workup should also include tests to determine any potential infectious trigger for DKA such as pneumonia or UTI. 

==Management==
Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is resolved with insulin infusion, intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement and supportive care. Alcoholic ketoacidosis is treated with intravenous dextrose and supportive care and usually does not require insulin. Starvation ketoacidosis can be resolved with intravenous dextrose with attention to electrolyte changes that can occur with refeeding syndrome.

==Epidemiology==
Certain populations are predisposed to develop ketoacidosis including people with diabetes, people with a history of prolonged and heavy alcohol use, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, children, and infants.

People with diabetes that produce very little or no insulin are predisposed to develop ketoacidosis, especially during periods of illness or missed insulin doses. This includes people with type 1 diabetes or ketosis prone diabetes.

Prolonged heavy alcohol use is a risk of ketoacidosis, especially in people with poor nutrition or a concurrent illness.

Pregnant women have high levels of hormones including glucagon and human placental lactogen that increase circulating free fatty acids which increases ketone production. Lactating women also are predisposed to increased ketone production. These populations are at risk of developing ketoacidosis in the setting of metabolic stressors such as fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, or acute illness.

Children and infants have lower glycogen stores and may develop high levels of glucagon and counter-regulatory hormones during acute illness, especially gastrointestinal illness. This allows children and infants to easily produce ketones and although rare, can progress to ketoacidosis in acute illness.

<text>Robert Morris (February 9, 1931 – November 28, 2018) was an American sculptor, conceptual artist and writer. He was regarded as having been one of the most prominent theorists of Minimalism along with Donald Judd, but also made important contributions to the development of performance art, land art, the Process Art movement, and installation art. Morris lived and worked in New York. In 2013 as part of the October Files, MIT Press published a volume on Morris, examining his work and influence, edited by Julia Bryan-Wilson.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Kansas City, Missouri to Robert O. Morris and Lora &quot;Pearl&quot; Schrock Morris. Between 1948 and 1950, Morris studied engineering at the University of Kansas. He then studied art at both the University of Kansas and at Kansas City Art Institute as well as philosophy at Reed College . He interrupted his studies in 1951-52 to serve with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Arizona and Korea. He married dancer Simone Forti in 1955 and later divorced in 1962. After moving to New York City in 1959 to study sculpture, he received a master&#x27;s degree in art history in 1963 from Hunter College.

== Work ==

Initially a painter, Morris’ work of the 1950s was influenced by Abstract Expressionism and particularly Jackson Pollock. While living in California, Morris also came into contact with the work of La Monte Young, John Cage, and Warner Jepson with whom he and first wife Simone Forti collaborated. The idea that art making was a record of a performance by the artist (drawn from Hans Namuth’s photos of Pollock at work) in the studio led to an interest in dance and choreography. During the 1950s, Morris&#x27; furthered his interest in dance while living in San Francisco with his wife, the dancer and choreographer Simone Forti. Morris moved to New York City in 1960. In 1962 where he staged the performance &quot;Column&quot; at the Living Theater in New York based on the exploration of bodies in space in which an upright square column after a few minutes on stage falls over.


In New York City, Morris began to explore the work of Marcel Duchamp, making conceptual pieces such as &quot;Box with the Sound of its Own Making&quot; (1961) and &quot;Fountain&quot; (1963). In 1963 he had an exhibition of Minimal sculptures at the Green Gallery in New York that was written about by Donald Judd. The following year, also at Green Gallery, Morris exhibited a suite of large-scale polyhedron forms constructed from 2 x 4s and gray-painted plywood. In 1964 Morris devised and performed two celebrated performance artworks &quot;21.3&quot; in which he lip syncs to a reading of an essay by Erwin Panofsky and &quot;Site&quot; with Carolee Schneemann. Morris enrolled at Hunter College in New York (his masters thesis was on the work of Brâncuși) and in 1966 published a series of influential essays &quot;Notes on Sculpture&quot; in Artforum. He exhibited two &quot;L Beams&quot; in the seminal 1966 exhibit, &quot;Primary Structures&quot; at the Jewish Museum in New York.

In 1967 Morris created &quot;Steam&quot;, an early piece of Land Art. In 1969, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. By the late 1960s Morris was being featured in museum shows in America but his work and writings drew criticism from Clement Greenberg. His work became larger scale taking up the majority of the gallery space with series of modular units or piles of earth and felt. &quot;Untitled (Pink Felt)&quot; (1970), for example, is composed of dozens of sliced pink industrial felt pieces that have been dropped on the floor. In 1971 Morris designed an exhibition for the Tate Gallery that took up the whole central sculpture gallery with ramps and cubes. He published a photo of himself dressed in S&amp;M gear in an advertisement in &quot;Artforum&quot;, similar to one by Lynda Benglis, with whom Morris had collaborated on several videos.

He created the Robert Morris Observatory in the Netherlands, a &quot;modern Stonehenge&quot;, which identifies the solstices and the equinoxes. It is at coordinates 52°32&#x27;58&quot;N 5°33&#x27;57&quot;E.

During the later 1970s, Morris switched to figurative work, a move that surprised many of his supporters. Themes of the work were often fear of nuclear war.

In 2002, Morris designed a set of seventeen pale blue and beige-coloured stained-glass windows for the medieval Maguelone Cathedral, near Montpelier in France. The windows, which depict the ripples of a pebble dropped in water, were produced by Ateliers Duchemin glassmakers and placed in restored romanesque window lights around the cathedral building.

At the time of his death in late November 2018 an exhibit of Morris&#x27; recent work &quot;Banners and Curses&quot; was on display at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City. The exhibition ran through January 25, 2019. Morris attended the opening night reception for the show at the gallery.

==Death==
Morris died on November 28, 2018, in Kingston, New York, from pneumonia at the age of 87. He had married Lucile Michels in 1984. He is survived by his wife Lucile and a daughter Laura Morris.

== Critical reception ==
In 1974, Robert Morris advertised his display at the Castelli Gallery with a poster showing him bare-chested in sadomasochistic garb. Critic Amelia Jones argued that the body poster was a statement about hyper-masculinity and the stereotypical idea that masculinity equated to homophobia. Through the poster, Morris equated the power of art with that of a physical force, specifically violence.

Robert Morris&#x27;s art is fundamentally theatrical. (…) his theater is one of negation: negation of the avant-gardist concept of originality, negation of logic and reason, negation of the desire to assign uniform cultural meanings to diverse phenomena; negation of a worldview that distrusts the unfamiliar and the unconventional. (Maurice Berger, &quot;Labyrinths: Robert Morris, Minimalism, and the 1960s&quot;, p. 3.)

In Morris&#x27; book, &quot;Continuous Project Altered Daily: The Writings of Robert Morris&quot;, the artist includes a collaborative project with the art critic G. Roger Denson in which he lampoons the criticism of his work published over the course of his career up to the early 1990s. The chapter, entitled &quot;Robert Morris Replies to Roger Denson (Or Is That a Mouse in My Paragon?)&quot;, lists thirteen questions submitted by Denson, with each question representing the criticism of Morris&#x27; work written by a different unnamed critic responding to a specific exhibition, installation, or art work. Instead of answering the questions, Morris has written an elaborate, comically absurd, satirical narrative that in many ways epitomizes the &quot;only possible response&quot; to criticism that had become fashionable in the so-called &quot;demise of criticism&quot; that some writers of the 1980s and 1990s heralded following the &quot;deconstruction of logocentrism&quot; postulated by the post-structuralist theorist Jacques Derrida. As one commentator, Brian Winkenweder, wrote:

&quot;In his reply [to Denson&#x27;s questions], Morris compartmentalized diverse aspects of his oeuvre into nine, named alter-egos such as Body Bob, Major Minimax, Lil Dahlink Felt, Mirror Stagette, Dirt Macher and Blind. He also appropriated the brick-hurling Ignatz Mouse from George Herriman&#x27;s comic strip Krazy Kat as rhetorical flourish to enhance his written answers to Denson&#x27;s questions.&quot;

Winkenweder then cites the mockery to which Morris&#x27; critics are subjected in his absurdist satire, as bricks are hurled at each of Denson&#x27;s questions.

&quot;Hey, what&#x27;s going on, Ignatz? Everybody is rolling on the floor and laughing. I&#x27;ve never seen such a hysterical gang of assassins. What, you read that ticket about our &#x27;new tone of ironic self-reference?&#x27; And what? Body Bob threw the I-Box at the Major who then bent Stagette out of shape with the Corner Piece and Blind smeared cup grease on Dirt Macher&#x27;s … wait a minute, Ignatz. You started this bedlam by throwing bricks at everyone, I bet...Get Body Bob out of that Kraut helmet immediately…No, I did not give it to Lil Dahlink Felt with the Card File. How could you think such a thing, Ignatz? You are so surly today. Why don&#x27;t I punch my own ticket?&quot; (Morris, 1993, 307).

== Exhibitions ==
Morris&#x27; first exhibition of paintings was held in 1958 at the Dilexi Gallery in San Francisco. Numerous museums have hosted solo exhibitions of his work, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1970), the Art Institute of Chicago (1980), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and the Newport Harbor Art Museum (1986), and the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (1990). 

In 1994, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, organized &quot;Robert Morris: The Mind/Body Problem&quot;, a major retrospective of the artist’s work, which traveled to the Deichtorhallen in Hamburg and the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris.

In 2024, the Pérez Art Museum Miami, included his work Untitled (Mirror Cubes) in &quot;Every Sound Is a Shape of Time: Selections from PAMM&#x27;s Collection&quot;, a comprehensive exhibition of diverse artworks spanning nearly thirty years of the institution&#x27;s collecting practices. 

== Notable works ==
* &quot;Box with the Sound of Its Own Making (1961)&quot;, Seattle Art Museum
* &quot;Untitled (Mirrored Cubes)&quot; (1965), Pérez Art Museum Miami 
* &quot;Steam Work for Bellingham-II (1974)&quot;, Western Washington University Public Sculpture Collection, Bellingham, Washington
*&quot;Untitled (L-Beams) (1965)&quot;, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York
* &quot;Labyrinth,&quot; 1982 Gori Collection, Italy

== Art market ==
As a conceptual artist, Morris at times contractually removed work from circulation. When a collector, the architect Philip Johnson, did not pay Morris for a work he had ostensibly purchased, the artist drew up a certificate of deauthorization that officially withdrew all aesthetic content from his piece, making it nonexistent as art.

<doc id="537806" wikidata="Q6929074" url="?curid=537806" title="Mr. Peanut">
<text>Mr. Peanut is the advertising logo and mascot of Planters, an American snack-food company owned by Hormel. He is depicted as an anthropomorphic peanut in its shell, wearing the formal clothing of an old-fashioned gentleman, with a top hat, monocle, white gloves, spats, and cane. He is reported of British heritage and has the proper name of Bartholomew Richard Fitzgerald-Smythe.

== History ==
Planters Peanut Company was founded in 1906 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania by Amedeo Obici, and incorporated two years later as the Planters Nut and Chocolate Company. In 1916, a young schoolboy, Antonio Gentile, submitted drawings of an anthropomorphic peanut to a design contest. When his design was chosen, commercial artist Andrew S. Wallach added the monocle, top hat, and cane to create the iconic image. Gentile&#x27;s family originally received five dollars for winning the contest. Obici befriended them and paid Antonio’s, and four of his siblings&#x27;, way through college. After Obici paid Antonio&#x27;s way through medical school as well, Antonio became a doctor in Newport News, where he died of a heart attack in 1939.

There is a disputed claim that Frank P. Krize Sr., a Wilkes-Barre artist and head of the Suffolk plant, made the additions of the monocle, top hat, and cane. Wallach&#x27;s daughter, Virginia, maintains that Krize joined the project after Mr. Peanut was created. However, neither Planters&#x27; history nor other sources still in circulation positively identify the artist.

By the mid-1930s, the raffish figure had come to symbolize the entire peanut industry. Mr. Peanut has appeared on almost every Planters package and advertisement and is one of the best-known icons in advertising history.
He has appeared in many TV commercials as an animated cartoon character. More recent commercials have shown him stop-motion animated in a real-world setting.

In 2005, Mr. Peanut was shown in MasterCard&#x27;s &quot;Icons&quot; commercial during Super Bowl XXXIX, which depicts several advertising mascots having dinner together.

In 2006, Planters held an online contest to determine whether to add a bow tie, cufflinks, or pocketwatch to Mr. Peanut. The public voted for no changes.

While the character&#x27;s television commercials were often accompanied by an accented narrator, Mr. Peanut never had dialogue. On November 8, 2010, Planters announced that actor Robert Downey Jr. would become Mr. Peanut&#x27;s first-ever voice actor.

In 2011, Mr. Peanut&#x27;s &quot;stunt double&quot;, Peanut Butter Doug, was introduced to tie in with the Planter&#x27;s Peanut Butter launch. The character is voiced by Kevin Dillon.

On July 1, 2013, Planters cast comedian and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumnus Bill Hader as the voice for a campaign focusing on its Planters Nut-rition product line.

In 2017, the Virginia General Assembly passed a joint resolution commending Mr. Peanut.

In 2018, Mr. Peanut was once again revamped, albeit for the first time since 2009, and became silent again.

=== Baby Nut and Peanut Jr. ===

On January 22, 2020, Planters released a teaser for its Super Bowl LIV commercial featuring Mr. Peanut, Wesley Snipes and Matt Walsh. The trio was shown hanging onto a branch after accidentally driving the Nutmobile off a cliff to avoid an armadillo, with Mr. Peanut electing to let go and fall to his death onto the Nutmobile, which then explodes. The company&#x27;s social media outlets stated that his funeral would be the subject of Planters&#x27; Super Bowl ad.

Planters suspended the campaign shortly after the Calabasas helicopter crash on January 26, which killed all passengers including former NBA player Kobe Bryant. They eventually resumed the campaign with the Super Bowl commercial, which showed Snipes and Walsh presiding over the funeral of Mr. Peanut, also attended by fellow mascots Kool-Aid Man and Mr. Clean. Kool-Aid Man&#x27;s tears combined with sunlight, causing a new, younger incarnation of Mr. Peanut, dubbed &quot;Baby Nut&quot;, to grow from the soil.

After the premiere of the commercial, the Planters Twitter account was used to make posts in character as Baby Nut. It also retweeted posts from several Baby Nut meme accounts created before the ad aired, prompting Twitter to suspend them under the presumption that they were created by the company&#x27;s agency to manipulate the platform in violation of its terms of use.

The campaign faced a mixed reaction from viewers, while comparisons were drawn between the character and other juvenile incarnations of characters seen in media, such as Grogu and Groot. Explaining the intent of the campaign, a spokesman for Planters&#x27; advertising agency cited the examples of superhero deaths in the Marvel Cinematic Universe for how such a death could connect with viewers and potential customers.

In August 2020, a continuation of the campaign launched, where Baby Nut is revealed to have aged into a 21-year-old young adult, &quot;Peanut Jr.&quot; This decision resulted in much more volatile reactions than Baby Nut&#x27;s campaign, with a tweet encouraging others to block Peanut Jr.&#x27;s account becoming viral.

=== A Nut Above, 2021 refresh ===
The Baby Nut campaign ended in February 2021, with Mr. Peanut returning to adulthood; Planters announced it would not &quot;spend $5 million dropping (the character) off a cliff&quot;; the company introduced a new campaign, &quot;A Nut Above&quot;, and announced that it would highlight people &quot;who made the world a little less nutty&quot; in 2020. In preparation for the sale of Planters by Kraft to Hormel, Planters relaunched the Mr. Peanut character in May 2021 with new commercials depicting a two-dimensional, animated version of the mascot, and focusing on the nutritional qualities of its products.

== In popular culture ==
In the 2010 novel &quot;Mr. Peanut&quot; by Adam Ross, a man fantasizes about killing his peanut-allergic wife by force-feeding her peanuts. &quot;He poured out a handful and ate them and then wiped the salt from his empty hand on his pants. He looked at the chipper Planters Peanuts man tipping his top hat hello and thought about how one bite could kill Alice dead.&quot;

The artist Vincent Trasov, dressed as Mr. Peanut, ran as a joke candidate in the 1974 Vancouver, British Columbia civic elections.

<text>The NAIA women&#x27;s basketball tournament has been held annually by the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics since 1981 to determine the national champion of women&#x27;s college basketball among its members in the United States and Canada.

The tournament was created to crown a women&#x27;s national title for smaller colleges and universities, debuting one year before the first NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament in 1982.

From 1992 to 2020, the NAIA sponsored two championships, one for its Division I members and another for those in its Division II. Both tournaments moved venues several times during the existences, with the final locations ultimately being Billings, Montana for Division I and Sioux City, Iowa for Division II. During this time, the NAIA tournaments featured 32 teams with the entire events contested at a single arena over the course of one week. Following renewals, the 2018 and 2019 tournaments were held in those same cities, but the 2020 tournaments were called off due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

From 2021, the two tournaments were merged back into a single event, which initially featured 48 teams in 2021 before expanding to 64 teams in 2022. Since the expansion of the tournament to its current size, the format of the event has featured teams beginning play at one of sixteen regional sites with the winners of those regionals advancing to play in a final, four-round national tournament in Sioux City, Iowa.

Dordt are the defending champions, winnining their first national title in 2024.

==Results==
===Single division (1981–1991)===
For the first eleven years that the NAIA sponsored women&#x27;s basketball, it held a single national championship for all programs across its entire membership. The tournament field was initially set at eight before later expansions to 16 and 32 teams. 

===Division I (1992–2020)===
The NAIA Women&#x27;s Basketball National Championship Tournament was most recently held at the Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark in Billings, Montana, which hosted from 2017 until the return to a single division after the 2019–20 season. The NAIA was the only international intercollegiate athletic association in North America; the NAIA Division I Women&#x27;s Basketball Championship was the first championship to feature a college from outside the United States in the championship game. Former member Simon Fraser University was the national DI runner-up in 1996 and 1997. Oklahoma City University has the most tournament championships with 9, and most championship game appearances with 11. 

===Single division (2021–present)===
In 2018, the NAIA announced a new format for the 2021 tournament after the merger of Divisions I and II.

==Champions==
*Division II titles are not included in this list. Schools in &quot;italics&quot; are no longer in the NAIA.

<text>Mianne Bagger (born 25 December 1966) is a professional golfer from Denmark. In 2004, by playing in the Women&#x27;s Australian Open, she became the first openly transitioned woman to play in a professional golf tournament. She also became the first trans woman to qualify for the Ladies European Tour in 2004, and the first high-profile transitioned woman to qualify for a professional sports tour since Renee Richards joined the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association tour during the 1970s.

She has been instrumental in gaining eligibility for transitioned women to compete on professional golf tours. Through her efforts, many professional golf organizations have amended their practices, but the policies generally still constrict rules of gender variance, and view atypically gendered women as something other than women. Bagger has sought to remove gender policies, specifically female-at-birth, as more problematic than helpful, and encourage sports organizations to see &quot;a fuller understanding and acceptance of gender variance and human diversity.&quot;

==Early life and amateur career==
Bagger was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 25 December 1966. She took up golf at the age of eight. At the age of 14, she was pictured with golfer Greg Norman during a golf clinic. Bagger moved with her family to Australia in 1979. In 1992 she started hormone replacement therapy, and in 1995 had sex reassignment surgery. In 1998 she returned to competitive golf as an amateur in Australia. She was open about her life and played in various amateur events around Adelaide and was invited to join the women&#x27;s South Australian State Squad. After winning the 1999 South Australian State Amateur the media attention increased.

Bagger played for the state team of South Australia (1999–2002) achieving a national top-ten rank for amateur women. She described facing suspicion from various players concerned about physiological unfairness: &quot;they would still just say that if I happen to do well or win a tournament, that it was because of an unfair advantage.&quot; She had researched the issues herself and, also through personal experience, believed that concerns were unfounded. All organizations that prevented her from competing had never actually done any research but had merely adopted a blanket ruling without question. Bagger answered that many people are not aware of physiological aspects of gender variant conditions and the issues related to transitioning. Bagger again won the South Australian Amateur in 2001 and 2002.

Bagger felt she had taken her amateur career as far as it could go and was looking to turn professional. She found that rules would prevent her from competing professionally in Australia and &quot;on most golf tours around the world.&quot; While still an amateur, she was offered the chance to play in the 2004 Women&#x27;s Australian Open. This led to a front-page story in Sydney, which prompted Bagger to hold a news conference the day before the tournament to answer questions and present information on transitioned and transgender people.

==Professional career and campaigning for trans rights==
After becoming the 6th best player in Australia in 2003, she turned a professional golfer.

* In 2004 she played the Swedish Telia Tour and finished twice in the top 10.
* In 2005 she played her first tournament on the Ladies European Tour. She finished in the 35th place
* In 2006 she finished on the 91st place
*In 2007 she finished as 54th

Her coach is Australian Andrew Mowatt at the Royal Fremantle Golf Club in Perth.

At Bagger&#x27;s first tournament as a professional, Laura Davies and Rachel Teske were among players who were happy to allow Bagger to compete. Bagger caused a media stir in 2004 when she played the Australia Women&#x27;s Open and had intentions also of joining the Australian Ladies Professional Golf Tour (ALPG Tour). At a tournament in the United States, she met Ty Votaw, the commissioner of the LPGA Tour, who was later questioned about their policies stating &quot;right now, our rule is that they have to be born women.&quot; Bagger notes that &quot;they obviously don&#x27;t consider that I meet that condition.&quot; Votaw left the possibility open for that rule to change in the future.

The 2004 ruling by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) regarding transitioned athletes led to a re-examination of rules in many sports. The IOC 2004 Stockholm Consensus, which researchers have criticized as &quot;a measure that polices the traditional gender binary while being disguised as a progressive and inclusive measure,&quot; spells out specific requirements for a transitioned athlete. Bagger notes that the USGA policy requires &quot;a signed waiver by the entrant giving complete and unrestricted access to one’s medical records and pre-operative and post-operative psychiatric records&quot; – requirements that are unheard of for other competitors.

In September 2004, after continued lobbying by Bagger, the Ladies European Tour voted on amending their membership entry criteria, allowing Bagger to compete on tour. Later that year, the ALPG also voted in favour of changing their constitution to remove the &#x27;female at birth&#x27; clause, thus making Bagger eligible to join the ALPG Tour in Australia. On 9 February 2005, the Ladies Golf Union also announced a policy change allowing Bagger to compete in the Women&#x27;s British Open. On 21 March 2005, the United States Golf Association announced it adopted a new &#x27;gender policy&#x27; that allows transitioned athletes to compete in USGA golf championships, including the upcoming U.S. Women&#x27;s Open. In 2010, the LPGA amended their bylaws and removed the &quot;female at birth&quot; entry condition. Although the various policy changes have enabled transitioned athletes to compete, the policies remain under review. Bagger, along with a few high-profile athletes and a growing number of medical professionals and researchers around the world, continue to lobby the IOC, IAAF, WADA et al. in their approach to embracing transitioned athletes. Bagger also shares that many of these decisions are made by popular vote of members, often professionals in their sport, who are not doctors or medical professionals, and have no relevant medical training.

<text>Planters Nut &amp; Chocolate Company is an American snack food company now owned by Hormel Foods. Planters is best known for its processed nuts and for the Mr. Peanut icon that symbolizes them. Mr. Peanut was created by grade schooler Antonio Gentile for a 1916 contest to design the company&#x27;s brand icon. The design was modified by a commercial artist and has continued to change over the years.

==History==
Planters was founded by Italian immigrant Amedeo Obici in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. He started his career as a bellhop and fruit stand vendor in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Obici later moved to Wilkes-Barre, opened his own fruit stand, and invested in a peanut roaster. Obici turned peddler within a few years, using a horse and wagon, and calling himself &quot;The Peanut Specialist&quot;. In 1906, Obici entered a partnership with Mario Peruzzi, the soon to be owner of Planters. Peruzzi had developed his own method of blanching whole roasted peanuts, doing away with the troublesome hulls and skins; and so with six employees, two large roasters, and crude machinery, Planters was founded. Amedeo Obici believed that prices and first profits were as important as repeat business, focusing his operation on quality and brand name for continued success. Two years later, the firm was incorporated as Planters Nut and Chocolate Company. By 1913, Obici had moved to Suffolk, Virginia, the peanut capital of the world, and opened the company&#x27;s first mass production plant and facility there. In 1950, the company created a puzzle called &quot;PLANTERSPEANUTSPUZZLE&quot; and offered prizes for that. It was acquired by Standard Brands in 1960. In 1981, Standard Brands merged with Nabisco Brands, which was acquired by Kraft Foods in 2000. Kraft subsequently merged with the H.J. Heinz Company to form Kraft Heinz in 2015.

In February 2021, Kraft Heinz announced it would sell Planters and its other nuts businesses to Hormel for $3.35 billion. The transaction was completed on June 7.

<text>The [[Kassel]] World War II bombings were a set of Allied strategic bombing attacks which took place from February 1942 to March 1945. In a single deadliest raid on 22–23 October 1943, 150,000 inhabitants were bombed-out, at least 6,000 people died, the vast majority of the city center was destroyed, and the fire of the most severe air raid burned for seven days. When the US First Army captured Kassel on 3 April 1945, only 50,000 inhabitants remained of its 1939 population of 236,000.

==Targets==

As well as being the capital of the provinces of Hesse-Nassau and Kurhessen, Kassel had some important targets:
*Fieseler aircraft facility
*Henschel &amp; Sohn facilities, maker of the Tiger I and King Tiger heavy tanks
* The Henschel &amp; Sohn firm&#x27;s locomotive plant
* engine plant
* motor transport plant
* railway works
* Military HQs at Wehrkreis IX, and Bereich Hauptsitz Kassel
* Central Germany HQ, highway &amp; railway construction
* Regional Supreme Court

<text>In economics, an Edgeworth box, sometimes referred to as an Edgeworth-Bowley box, is a graphical representation of a market with just two commodities, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, and two consumers. The dimensions of the box are the total quantities Ω&quot;x&quot; and Ω&quot;y&quot; of the two goods.

Let the consumers be Octavio and Abby. The top right-hand corner of the box represents the allocation in which Octavio holds all the goods, while the bottom left corresponds to complete ownership by Abby. Points within the box represent ways of allocating the goods between the two consumers.

Market behaviour will be determined by the consumers&#x27; indifference curves. The blue curves in the diagram represent indifference curves for Octavio, and are shown as convex from his viewpoint (i.e. seen from the bottom left). The orange curves apply to Abby, and are convex as seen from the top right. Moving up and to the right increases Octavio&#x27;s allocation and puts him onto a more desirable indifference curve while placing Abby onto a less desirable one. 

Convex indifference curves are considered to be the usual case. They correspond to diminishing returns for each good relative to the other.

Exchange within the market starts from an initial allocation known as an &quot;endowment&quot;.

The main use of the Edgeworth box is to introduce topics in general equilibrium theory in a form in which properties can be visualised graphically. It can also show the difficulty of moving to an efficient outcome in the presence of bilateral monopoly. In the latter case, it serves as a precursor to the bargaining problem of game theory that allows a unique numerical solution.

==History==
===Development of the Edgeworth box===
The Edgeworth box is named after Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, who presented it in his book &quot;Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences&quot;, 1881.
Edgeworth&#x27;s original two-axis depiction was developed into the now familiar box diagram by Pareto in his 1906 &quot;Manual of Political Economy&quot; and was popularized in a later exposition by Bowley. The modern version of the diagram is commonly referred to as the Edgeworth–Bowley box.

===The mathematical theory of economic equilibrium===
The conceptual framework of equilibrium in a market economy was developed by Léon Walras and further extended by Vilfredo Pareto. It was examined with close attention to generality and rigour by twentieth century mathematical economists including Abraham Wald, Paul Samuelson, Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu. This was part of a wider movement in which Wald also sought to bring greater rigour to decision theory and many mathematicians concentrated on minimising dependence on the axiom of choice.

The theory of Walrasian markets has taken pains to find the most general premises from which a given conclusion can be obtained. Areas in which premises can be strengthened or weakened include:
* Whether functions are differentiable;
* Whether indifference curves are primitive or derivable from utility functions; and
* Whether indifference curves are convex.
Assumptions are also made of a more technical nature, e.g. non-reversibility, saturation, etc. 
The pursuit of rigour is not always conducive to intelligibility. In this article indifference curves will be treated as primitive. At first we will view them as convex and differentiable and concentrate on interior equilibria, but we will subsequently relax these assumptions.

==Market equilibrium==
Since there are only two commodities the effective price is the exchange rate between them. Our aim is to find the price at which market equilibrium can be attained, which will be a point at which no further transactions are desired, starting from a given endowment. These quantities will be determined by the indifference curves of the two consumers as shown in Fig. 2. 

We shall assume that every day Octavio and Abby go to market with endowments and of the two commodities, corresponding to the position ω in the diagram. The two consumers will exchange between themselves under competitive market behaviour. This assumption requires a certain suspension of disbelief since the conditions for perfect competition – which include an infinite number of consumers – aren&#x27;t satisfied. 

If two &quot;Xs exchange for a single &quot;Y&quot;, then Octavio&#x27;s and Abby&#x27;s transaction will take them to some point along the solid grey line, which is known as a budget line&quot;&#x27;. (To be more precise, a budget line may be defined as a straight line through the endowment point representing allocations obtainable by exchange at a certain price.) Budget lines for a couple of other prices are also shown as dashed and dotted lines in Fig. 2.

The equilibrium corresponding to a given endowment ω is determined by the pair of indifference curves which have a common tangent such that this tangent passes through ω. We will use the term &#x27;price line&#x27; to denote a common tangent to two indifference curves. An equilibrium therefore corresponds to a budget line which is also a price line, and the price at equilibrium is the gradient of the line. In Fig. 3 ω is the endowment and ω″ is the equilibrium allocation.

The reasoning behind this is as follows.

Firstly, any point in the box must lie on exactly one of Abby&#x27;s indifference curves and on exactly one of Octavio&#x27;s. If the curves cross (as shown in Fig. 4) then they divide the immediate neighbourhood into four regions, one of which (shown as pale green) is preferable for both consumers; therefore a point at which indifference curves cross cannot be an equilibrium, and an equilibrium must be a point of tangency.

Secondly, the only price which can hold in the market at the point of tangency is the one given by the gradient of the tangent, since at only this price will the consumers be willing to accept limitingly small exchanges.

And thirdly (the most difficult point) all exchanges taking the consumers on the path from ω to equilibrium must take place at the same price. If this is accepted, then that price must be the one operative at the point of tangency, and the result follows.

In a two-person economy there is no guarantee that all exchanges will take place at the same price. But the purpose of the Edgeworth box is not to illustrate the price fixing which can take place when there is no competition, but rather to illustrate a competitive economy in a minimal case. So we may imagine that instead of a single Abby and a single Octavio we have an infinite number of clones of each, all coming to market with identical endowments at different times and negotiating their way gradually to equilibrium. A newly arrived Octavio may exchange at market price with an Abby who is close to equilibrium, and so long as a newly arrived Abby exchanges with a nearly satisfied Octavio the numbers will balance out. For exchange to work in a large competitive economy, the same price must reign for everyone. Thus exchange must move the allocation along the price line as we have defined it.

The task of finding a competitive equilibrium accordingly reduces to the task of finding a point of tangency between two indifference curves for which the tangent passes through a given point. The use of offer curves (described below) provides a systematic procedure for doing this.

==Pareto set==
An allocation of goods is said to &#x27;Pareto dominate&#x27; another if it is preferable for one consumer and no worse for the other. An allocation is said to be &#x27;Pareto optimal&#x27; (or &#x27;Pareto efficient&#x27;) if no other allocation Pareto dominates it. The set of Pareto optimal allocations is known as the Pareto set (or &#x27;efficient locus&#x27;).

Consider a pair of tangential curves, one for each consumer as illustrated in Fig. 5, where the point of tangency is shown by the purple dot. Then convexity guarantees that the curves cannot intercept other than at the point of tangency, and the box is accordingly divided into 3 regions. The pale blue area is preferable to the point of tangency for Octavio but worse for Abby; the pale orange area is preferable for Abby but worse for Octavio; and the white area is worse for both. Similar considerations apply to the boundaries. It follows that the point of tangency is Pareto optimal.

Thus the Pareto set is the locus of points of tangency of the curves. This is a line connecting Octavio&#x27;s origin (O) to Abby&#x27;s (A). An example is shown in Fig. 6, where the purple line is the Pareto set corresponding to the indifference curves for the two consumers.

The vocabulary used to describe different objects which are part of the Edgeworth box diverges. The entire Pareto set is sometimes called the contract curve, while Mas-Colell et al. restrict the definition of the contract curve to only those points on the Pareto set which make both Abby and Octavio at least as well off as they are at their initial endowment. Other authors who have a more game theoretical bent, such as Martin Osborne and Ariel Rubinstein, use the term core for the section of the Pareto set which is at least as good for each consumer as the initial endowment.

Since the Pareto set is the set of points where the consumers&#x27; indifference curves are tangential, it is also the set of points where each consumer&#x27;s marginal rate of substitution is equal to that of the other person.

==The first fundamental theorem of welfare economics==
We have seen that the points of tangency of indifference curves are the Pareto optima, but we also saw previously that the economic equilibria are those points at which indifference curves are tangential to a common price line. It follows that the equilibria are precisely the Pareto optima. 

This argument applies with one restriction even if the curves are undifferentiable or if the equilibrium is on the boundary. The condition for equilibrium is that no further exchange will take place, and the condition for no further exchange to take place is that there is no direction of motion which benefits one consumer without harming the other; and this is equivalent to the definition of a Pareto optimum.

The restriction is that equilibrium implies that no &quot;local&quot; improvement can be made – in other words, that the point is &#x27;locally&#x27; Pareto optimal. But Pareto optimality is nowadays considered global by definition. Thus if the nature of the indifference curves allows non-global optima to arise (as cannot happen if they are convex), then it is possible for equilibria not to be Pareto optimal.

Perfect competition is not a precondition for the theorem. So long as the consumers are free to exchange, and will continue to do so until no mutually acceptable exchange is available, equilibrium will be reached and will be (at least &#x27;locally&#x27;) Pareto optimal.

==The second fundamental theorem of welfare economics==
Now consider an economy in which the consumers have endowments ω as shown in Fig. 7. Left to itself a free market will take them to ω&#x27;. But suppose that some other position in the box – say α&#x27; – is considered socially preferable. We can assume that the socially desired position is Pareto optimal. 

We may think of the price lines (shown as dashed in the diagram) as corresponding to different distributions of real income, and movement along them as reallocation of resources while incomes remain fixed. 

Then in order to reposition society at the desired point α&#x27; it is not necessary for the government to redistribute resources in such a way that Octavio holds (α&#x27;&quot;x&quot;,α&#x27;&quot;y&quot;) and Abby holds the complement: it is sufficient to reallocate resources to take the economy to &quot;any&quot; point (say α) on the price line through α&#x27;, and then leave the market to find its own equilibrium. Indeed, so long as the government recognises a desirable distribution of income it does not need to have any idea of the optimal allocation of resources.

In a statement for a more general economy, the theorem would be taken as saying that α&#x27; can be reached by a monetary transfer followed by the free play of market exchange; but money is absent from the Edgeworth box.

The second fundamental theorem does not provide a blueprint for righting society&#x27;s ills. The government may decide to reallocate resources between Octavio and Abby, moving them from ω to α in advance of the day&#x27;s trading; and in consequence whoever loses out may decide to take less to market the next day. The second fundamental theorem takes no account of the distortions introduced by the reallocation.

==Offer curves==
Offer curves provide a means of finding points of equilibrium, and are also useful for investigating their existence and uniqueness. 

Two such curves, one for each consumer and both depending on the endowment, can be drawn in the box. We pivot the budget line about ω and trace the two consumers&#x27; most favoured points along the line as shown by the coloured dots in Fig. 8. These are points at which the line is tangential to their own indifference curves.

The locus of a consumer&#x27;s most favoured points is his or her offer curve. Fig. 9 shows Octavio&#x27;s offer curve as dark blue and Abby&#x27;s as brown. They meet at the point ω″ and the equilibrium budget line (drawn in grey) is the one passing through this point. The indifference curves through ω″ for the two consumers are shown in paler colours.

An offer curve necessarily passes through the endowment point ω. If we take Abby as an example, we note that one of her indifference curves must pass through ω and that a budget line can be chosen to have the same gradient as the indifference curve here, making ω a most favoured point for this line. 

In consequence the two consumers&#x27; offer curves necessarily intersect at ω; but the property which makes this happen is that ω is the only possible point of intersection consistent with budget lines of differing gradient, and that therefore it doesn&#x27;t necessarily constitute an equilibrium. 

Any intersection of offer curves at a point other than ω determines a stable equilibrium. If the two offer curves are tangential at the endowment point, then this point is indeed an equilibrium and their common tangent is the corresponding budget line.

===Terminology for offer curves===
Offer curves were first used by Vilfredo Pareto – see his &quot;Manuale&quot;/&quot;Manuel&quot; Chap. III, §97. He called them &#x27;exchange curves&#x27; (&quot;linee dei baratti&quot; / &quot;lignes des échanges&quot;), and his name for Octavio&#x27;s preferred allocation along a budget line was his &#x27;equilibrium point&#x27;.

This preferred allocation is sometimes nowadays referred to as Octavio&#x27;s &#x27;demand&#x27;, which constitutes an asymmetric description of a symmetric fact. An allocation determines Abby&#x27;s holding as much as Octavio&#x27;s, and is therefore as much a supply as a demand. 

&quot;Offre&quot; is French for &#x27;supply&#x27;, so calling an offer curve a locus of demands amounts to calling a supply curve a locus of demands.

===Uniqueness of equilibria===
It might be supposed from economic considerations that if a shared tangent exists through a given endowment, and if the indifference curves are not pathological in their shape, then the point of tangency will be unique. This turns out not to be true. Conditions for uniqueness of equilibrium have been the subject of extensive research: see General equilibrium theory.

Figs. 9 and 10 illustrate an example from Mas-Colell et al. in which three distinct equilibria correspond to the endowment point ω. The indifference curves are:

formula_1 (Octavio)

formula_2 (Abby).

The indifference curves fill the box but are only shown when tangential to some representative budget lines. 
The offer curves, drawn in Fig. 11, cross at three points shown by large grey dots and corresponding to exchange rates of , 1 and 2.

==Generalisations==
Early examinations of the properties of equilibrium were based on an implicit definition as tangency, and convexity seems to have been implicitly assumed. There was no doubt that equilibrium would be reached: gradient ascent would lead to it. But the results lacked generality.

===Boundary equilibria and non-differentiable curves===
Kenneth Arrow and Gérard Debreu published papers independently in 1951 drawing attention to limitations in the calculus proofs of equilibrium theorems. Arrow specifically mentioned the difficulty caused by equilibria on the boundary, and Debreu the problem of non-differentiable indifference curves.

Without aiming for exhaustive coverage it is easy to see in intuitive terms how to extend our methods to apply to these cases. We need to broaden the concept of a tangent to include any line which touches the curve: a tangent in the etymological sense rather than that of the differential calculus. In the example of Fig. 12 there is an arc of legal price lines through a point of contact, each touching indifference curves without cutting them inside the box, and accordingly there is a range of possible equilibria for a given endowment.

===Competitive equilibrium===
The equilibria of Fig. 12 are not points at which curves are true tangents to each other. They do however have a property which generalises the definition in terms of tangents, which is that the two curves can be locally separated by a straight line. 

Arrow and Debreu defined equilibrium in the same way as each other in their (independent) papers of 1951 without providing any source or rationale for their definition. They retained their definition in their joint paper (on the existence of equilibrium) of 1954. The new definition required a change of mathematical technique from the differential calculus to convex set theory.

Their definition in effect was this: an equilibrium attainable from an endowment ω consists of an allocation x and a budget line through x and ω such that there is no point along the line which either consumer (strictly) prefers to x. A pair comprising an allocation and a line which satisfies this property is known as a &#x27;Walrasian&#x27; or &#x27;competitive&#x27; equilibrium.

The budget line of this definition is a line which separates the indifference curves of the two consumers, but it does so &quot;globally&quot; rather than locally. Arrow and Debreu do not explain why they require global separation, which may have made their proofs easier but can be seen to have unexpected consequences. In Fig. 13 the point x is a point of tangency which is also a point at which indifference curves are locally separated by the dashed price line; but since they are not globally separated the point is not an equilibrium according to Arrow and Debreu&#x27;s definition. 

In Fig. 14 the point x is a Pareto optimum which does not satisfy the definition of competitive equilibrium. The question of whether the economy would &quot;settle&quot; at such a point is quite separate from whether it satisfies a given definition of equilibrium; evidently in this case it would indeed settle there. 

Arrow and Debreu always included the convexity of indifference curves amongst their &#x27;assumptions&#x27;. The term &#x27;assumptions&#x27; is a vague one which might refer to a presupposition underlying definitions as well as theorems, or to a premise which is needed only for the latter. Given that their definition does not include all equilibria which may exist when curves may be non-convex, it is possible that they meant the assumption of convexity in the former sense. Whether or not this is so, the definition has been widely adopted without any restriction of domain. 

It has sometimes been found that results can be derived under their definition without assuming convexity in the proof (the first fundamental theorem of welfare economics being an example).

===Existence of competitive equilibrium===
In some economies there will be no resting point reachable from a given endowment by exchange at uniform prices; hence no resting point exists satisfying the definition of competitive equilibrium. Families of curves of the pattern of Fig. 14 are an example of this.

===The fundamental theorems of welfare economics===
With equilibrium defined as &#x27;competitive equilibrium&#x27;, the first fundamental theorem can be proved even if indifference curves need not be convex: any competitive equilibrium is (globally) Pareto optimal. However the proof is no longer obvious, and the reader is referred to the article on Fundamental theorems of welfare economics.

The same result would not have been considered to hold (with non-convex indifference curves) under the tangency definition of equilibrium. The point x of Fig. 13 would have been considered an equilibrium which was &quot;not&quot; (globally) optimal since the yellow region Pareto dominates it. 

It does not follow that the result has been strengthened since the attainability of equilibrium has been rendered doubtful. In Fig. 13 the point x may not be a &#x27;competitive equilibrium&#x27;, but the economy can get stuck there preventing it from reaching the &#x27;true&#x27; (and Pareto optimal) equilibrium in the yellow region. 
It was always considered essential to the first welfare theorem that equilibrium would actually be attained. Lerner&#x27;s interpretation of the theorem was that &quot;Fortunately the optimum allocation of goods can be reached automatically&quot;. However nothing can guarantee that a global optimum will be attained when local optima are present. If the concept of equilibrium includes local optima such as x, then equilibrium may be attainable but sub-optimal; if such points are excluded, then equilibrium may be optimal but unattainable. 

The differences caused by non-convexity become more deep-rooted when we look at the second fundamental theorem. Not every Pareto optimum is a competitive equilibrium (though it may still be a resting place for the economy). Consequently the theorem needs either to be given convexity of preferences as a premise, or else to be stated in such a way that &#x27;equilibrium&#x27; is not understood as &#x27;competitive equilibrium&#x27; as defined above.

The School of Art &amp; Design is located at the Clare Street and Clonmel campuses.

The institute offered courses from level 6 (certificate) through level 10 (PhD) whilst also catering for craft apprentices and adult and continuing education. The institute had twice been named as &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Institute of Technology of the Year in &quot;The Sunday Times University Guide&quot;, firstly in 2008 and again in 2013.

A consortium between the Athlone Institute of Technology and itself was announced with the intention of forming a technological university. On 23 November 2020, the AIT-LIT Consortium announced that the joint Limerick-Athlone IT application for Technological University status had been submitted for government approval, which was granted in May 2021. On 16 July 2021, the institute of technology was officially dissolved and succeeded by the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, which began operations on 1 October 2021.

== History ==
The Limerick Institute of Technology (LIT) can trace its roots back to the School of Ornamental Art on Leamy Street, Limerick, on 3 July 1852. This re-opened in 1855 on Cecil Street under the auspices of the Limerick Athenaeum, founded by William Lane Joynt. The Limerick Athenaeum was part of an international movement for the promotion of artistic and scientific learning, started by John Wilson Croker at the Athenaeum Club in London in 1823.

The trustees of the Limerick Athenaeum handed the building over to Limerick Corporation in 1896 in order to administer the property for the advancement of artistic and technical education in Limerick. This brought the tradition of fusing artistic and technical education into the public domain, a tradition that had been retained and refined by the institute.

For much of the history of the school, it was constituted as the Municipal Technical Institute (known locally as &quot;The Red Tech&quot;) which was opened in 1910. By the 1970s, it had grown to such a degree that a new campus had to be acquired in Moylish for technical education, with artistic education continuing in a number of locations in the city centre.

The Limerick City Vocational Education Committee (VEC) founded the college in 1975 as the Limerick Technical College. The institute was constituted as the Limerick College of Art, Commerce and Technology (Limerick CoACT) in 1980, became a regional technical college in 1993, and finally an institute of technology in 1997.

Moylish had since developed into the main campus of the Limerick Institute of Technology, with the Limerick School of Art and Design located at both the Moylish campus and the Clare Street campus since 2008.

In 2012, LIT merged with the Tipperary Institute, which had been founded in 1998. This merger brought two new campus locations in Thurles and Clonmel, as well as increased the institution&#x27;s footprint across the region. This footprint was further extended in Clare when the institute introduced degree-level education at its Ennis Learning Centre in 2016. In 2017, the institute was granted planning permission for a new campus at Coonagh in Limerick, to be focused on teaching and research in engineering.

Pat MacDonagh served as head of the college from 1978 through its evolution. He resigned as director in 2003. Dr. Maria Hinfelaar joined in 2004 as president, serving for 11 years. In 2016, Vincent Cunnane was appointed president of the institute.

=== AIT-LIT Consortium and dissolution ===
In October 2019, a consortium between the Athlone Institute of Technology and itself was announced with the intention of forming a technological university. On 23 November 2020, the AIT-LIT Consortium announced that the joint Limerick-Athlone IT application for technological university (TU) status had been submitted for approval. Approval was announced in May 2021 by minister of Higher Education, Simon Harris. On 31 August 2021, it was announced that outgoing LIT president Vincent Cunnane would be appointed as the new technological university&#x27;s first president.

On 16 July 2021, both the Athlone Institute of Technology and itself were officially dissolved through a signed order by the minister. The institute was succeeded by the Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, which began operations on 1 October 2021.

== Organisation ==

The institute was divided into four Schools, each with constituent departments:
* Limerick School of Art &amp; Design
** Department of Design
** Department of Fine Art
** Department of Digital Arts &amp; Media
* Applied Sciences &amp; Technology
** Department of Applied Science

The Development Office worked with the registrar and heads of school/department to address the widening participation agenda in the broadest sense from level 6 to level 10 as per the National Framework of Qualifications by piloting new initiatives and then assisting to mainstream these initiatives within LIT. The Development Office activity included: enhancing R&amp;D and Technology Transfer; managing relationships with second-level education providers; Lifelong Learning; and liaison with enterprise and employment development agencies in the mid-west region.

== Enterprise and research ==
One of LIT&#x27;s attributes were its co-location of enterprise campuses with all of its education campuses.

The Enterprise Acceleration Centre (EAC) is an incubation facility for start-up companies, with particular emphasis on export and growth-focused businesses. The centre is located on the Moylish Park campus and is 1,350 m2 with 18 self-contained units. Client companies can rent office suites and avail of management development supports, including one-to-one business coaching, peer networking and research collaboration. The centre works with enterprise support agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and County &amp; City Enterprise Boards and is a Microsoft BizSpark Network Partner.

The Shannon Applied Biotechnology Centre (SABC) is based on the main campus and is a joint venture between LIT and the Institute of Technology, Tralee.

== Sports ==
LIT had a focus on sport with basketball, hurling and rugby being the most dominant. Most recently, LIT&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team won All Ireland Division 3 championship in 2016, and All Ireland Division 2 championship in 2019. The players of the man&#x27;s basketball team are commonly referred to as &#x27;Champs&#x27;. The institute senior hurling team captured the Fitzgibbon Cup in 2005 and 2007 and the senior rugby team captured the All-Ireland Colleges Championship in 1998, 1999 and 2005.

One of the largest sports clubs in the institute is the Outdoor Club. This was founded in 2001 and runs on the philosophy &quot;alternative activities for all&quot;. It caters for all students, past and present interested in non-competitive activities such as hillwalking, orienteering, mountaineering, canoeing/kayaking, rock climbing, windsurfing, surfing, caving, sailing, and mountain biking.

LIT had a number of sports-related courses with programmes in strength and conditioning being run at its Thurles campus, in partnership with the online sports college Setanta College, and the Department of Humanities offers a level 8-degree in Business Studies with Sports Management.

== Millennium Theatre ==
The Millennium Theatre is located at Moylish Park and is host to a variety of live entertainment, concerts, recitals, drama, comedy and dance, with a capacity of 400. It also acts as a learning space for students in a number of disciplines, including music and sound production.

== Accommodation ==
There have been several notable student villages to accommodate students attending the institute, with the largest ones being Thomond Village and Cratloe Wood Student Village.

<text>The Fremont Troll (also known as The Troll, or the Troll Under the Bridge) is a public sculpture in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States.

==Description==

&quot;The Troll&quot; is a mixed media colossal statue, located on N. 36th Street at Troll Avenue N., under the north end of the George Washington Memorial Bridge (also known as the Aurora Bridge). It is clutching an actual Volkswagen Beetle, as if it had just swiped it from the roadway above. The vehicle has a California license plate. Originally, the car held a time capsule, including a plaster bust of Elvis Presley, which was stolen when the sculpture was vandalized.

&quot;The Troll&quot; is high, weighs , and is made of steel rebar, wire, and concrete.

==Artists and inspiration==
&quot;The Troll&quot; was sculpted by four artists: Steve Badanes, Will Martin, Donna Walter, and Ross Whitehead. The idea of a troll living under a bridge is derived from the Scandinavian (Norwegian) folklore.

The artists have copyright to the &quot;Troll&quot; images. They have sued businesses that use its image commercially without written permission. Postcards, beer, and other products approved by the artists are commercially available, and use is free to non-profit organizations.

==History==

In 1990, the Fremont Arts Council launched an art competition for the area under the bridge with the intent to construct hostile architecture to deter the presence of &quot;rodents, mattresses, beer cans, [and] guys sleeping&quot; there, believing that the solution to the issue was &quot;having a piece of art&quot; instead. The piece, built later that same year, easily won the competition, and was meant to become a cultural icon of the city from its conception. The vote in favor of the &quot;funky&quot; troll was also motivated of concerns about increased development in Fremont, including numerous large apartment buildings and an office park, urbanizing the largely residential neighborhood.

The construction of the troll provoked immediate complaints from homeless people who previously lived under the bridge, and in 1991, just a year after it was erected, neighbors funded powerful floodlights to deter squatters and &quot;late-night revelers&quot; from acts of vandalism targeting the troll&#x27;s beard and hair, as well as the continued dumping of trash around it by homeless people who used to live there. Despite the intent of the arts council, the sculpture has periodically been the target of vandalism, although local activists have made efforts to clean graffiti on a regular basis, and the city of Seattle has swept homeless encampments adjacent to the sculpture following repeated drug overdoses in January 2019; from January to mid-May alone, the city received 28 complaints about needles or homelessness within a block of the sculpture.

In 2005, the segment of Aurora Avenue North under the bridge, running downhill from the Troll to North 34th Street was renamed &quot;Troll Avenue&quot; in honor of the sculpture. In 2011, the Fremont Arts Council licensed a Chia Pet based on the Fremont Troll that was sold at a local drug store chain.&gt;

The stairway leading to the top of the sculpture was rebuilt in September 2023 using funds from the Move Seattle levy; the Troll is planned to be surrounded by more vegetation planted by volunteers the following month.

== In popular culture ==
The 1999 romantic comedy film &quot;10 Things I Hate About You &quot;features the Fremont Troll in a scene between Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#x27;s and Larisa Oleynik&#x27;s characters.

The 2015 video game &quot;Life is Strange&quot; features the Fremont Troll partway through the first episode, in which the player can find a picture of the protagonist, Max, and two of her friends from her time living in Seattle, climbing on the sculpture.

The seventh and final season of the ABC fantasy-drama series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; features a fictionalized version of the sculpture. Filming for the series took place in Vancouver, Canada, as such, a replica of the sculpture was built for the show. In the season&#x27;s fourteenth episode, &quot;The Girl in the Tower&quot;, a backstory for the sculpture is revealed, which includes references to the 1982 children&#x27;s book &quot;The BFG&quot;. In 2016, the Chicago rock band Majungas released &quot;The Fremont Troll&quot; off their Seattle Rock album.

In 2022, the Seattle Kraken introduced Buoy, a mascot said to be the Fremont Troll&#x27;s nephew.

In 2022, the Seattle Repertory Theatre produced &quot;Lydia and the Troll&quot; a play that heavily featured the Fremont Troll.

<text>The Troll by Julia Donaldson with illustrations by David Roberts is a children&#x27;s story about a troll and some pirates. 

==Plot==

The troll in this story is based on the troll from the &quot;Three Billy Goats Gruff&quot; fairy tale. However, in this story, no goats ever cross the troll&#x27;s bridge and he is forced to survive on fish that he catches from the river. He does encounter, in turn, a spider, a mouse and a rabbit, each of which convinces the troll not to eat them by telling him that he should try a bridge further down the river that is more suitable for capturing goats as he is &quot;sick of fish&quot;. Meanwhile, the pirate captain Hank Chief and his crew (Peg Polkadot, Ben Buckle, and Percy Patch) are searching for the treasure that is marked on their map, but are unable to locate the correct island. The pirates also display very poor culinary skills. Eventually, the troll reaches the sea and realises that he has been tricked by the other animals; he sees what he thinks are goat tracks in the sand and sets about laying a trap for the goat in a spot not too far from the location on the pirate&#x27;s treasure map. He duly discovers an old chest when digging a large hole to ensnare his prey and throws away the &quot;round shiny objects&quot; he finds therein. He decides to lie in wait in the chest for the goat and falls asleep. Predictably, the pirates then arrive and make off with their &quot;treasure&quot;; upon opening the chest the pirates decide to make the troll walk the plank, until Peg discovers the troll&#x27;s frying pan and cookbook. On discovering the troll&#x27;s culinary talents, they agree to spare the troll and make him their cook. The troll is delighted and proceeds to tell the pirates that he will make them his favourite goat stew only to be advised, to his horror, that all the pirates desire is fish.

<text>A police dog, also known as a K-9 (portmanteau of canine),is a dog that is trained to assist police and other law enforcement officers. Their duties may include searching for drugs and explosives, locating missing people, finding crime scene evidence, protecting officers and other people, and attacking suspects who flee from officers. The breeds most commonly used by law enforcement are the German Shepherd, Belgian Malinois, Bloodhound, Dutch Shepherd, and Labrador Retriever. In recent years, the Belgian Malinois has become the leading choice for police and military work due to their intense drive, focus, agility, and smaller size, though German Shepherds remain the breed most associated with law enforcement.

Police dogs are used on a federal and local level for law enforcement purposes in many parts of the world. They are often assigned to what in some
nations is referred to as a K-9 Unit, with a specific handler, and must remember several verbal cues and hand gestures. Initial training for a police dog typically takes between eight months and a year, depending on where and how they are trained, and for what purpose. Police dogs often regularly take training programs with their assigned handler to reinforce their training. In many countries, intentionally injuring or killing a police dog is a criminal offense.

==History==
===Early history===
Dogs have been used in law enforcement since the Middle Ages. Wealth and money was then tithed in the villages for the upkeep of the parish constable&#x27;s bloodhounds that were used for hunting down outlaws. The first recorded use of police dogs were in the early 14th century in St. Malo, France, where dogs were used to guard docks and piers. By the late 14th century, bloodhounds were used in Scotland, known as &quot;Slough dogs&quot; – the word &quot;Sleuth&quot;, (meaning detective) was derived from this. Between the 12th and 20th centuries, police dogs on the British Isles and European continent were primarily used for their tracking abilities.

The rapid urbanization of England and France in the 19th century increased public concern regarding growing lawlessness. In London, the existing law enforcement, the Bow Street Runners, struggled to contain the crime on their own, and as a result, private associations were formed to help combat crime. Night watchmen were employed to guard premises, and were provided with firearms and dogs to protect themselves from criminals.

===Modern era===

One of the first attempts to use dogs in policing was in 1889 by the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police of London, Sir Charles Warren. Warren&#x27;s repeated failures at identifying and apprehending the serial killer Jack the Ripper had earned him much vilification from the press, including being denounced for not using bloodhounds to track the killer. He soon had two bloodhounds trained for the performance of a simple tracking test from the scene of another of the killer&#x27;s crimes. The results were far from satisfactory, with one of the hounds biting the Commissioner and both dogs later running off, requiring a police search to find them.

It was in Continental Europe that dogs were first used on a large scale. Police in Paris began using dogs against roaming criminal gangs at night, but it was the police department in Ghent, Belgium that introduced the first organized police dog service program in 1899. These methods soon spread to Austria-Hungary and Germany; in the latter the first scientific developments in the field took place with experiments in dog breeding and training. The German police selected the German Shepherd Dog as the ideal breed for police work and opened up the first dog training school in 1920 in Greenheide. In later years, many Belgian Malinois dogs were added to the unit. The dogs were systematically trained in obedience to their officers and tracking and attacking criminals. 

In Britain, the North Eastern Railway Police were among the first to use police dogs in 1908 to put a stop to theft from the docks in Hull. By 1910, railway police forces were experimenting with other breeds such as Belgian Malinois, Labrador Retrievers, and German shepherds.

== Training ==

Popular dog breeds used by law enforcement include the Airedale terrier, Akita, Groenendael, Tervueren, Malinois dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Bloodhound, Border Collie, Boxer, Bouvier des Flandres, Briard, Cane Corso, Bullmastiff, Croatian Sheepdog, Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd, German Shorthaired Pointer, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Rottweiler and English Springer Spaniel, Dogo Argentino.

Training of police dogs is a very lengthy process since it begins with the training of the canine handler. The canine handlers go through a long process of training to ensure that they will train the dog to the best of its ability. First, the canine handler has to complete the requisite police academy training and one to two years of patrol experience before becoming eligible to transfer to a specialty canine unit. This is because the experience as an officer allows prospective canine officers to gain valuable experience in law enforcement. However, having dog knowledge and training outside of the police academy is considered to be an asset, this could be dog obedience, crowd control, communicating effectively with animals and being approachable and personable since having a dog will draw attention from surrounding citizens.

For a dog to be considered for a police department, it must first pass a basic obedience training course. They must be able to obey the commands of their handler without hesitation. This allows the officer to have complete control over how much force the dog should use against a suspect. Dogs trained in Europe are usually given commands in the country&#x27;s native language. Dogs are initially trained with this language for basic behavior, so, it is easier for the officer to learn new words/commands, rather than retraining the dog to new commands. This is contrary to the popular belief that police dogs are trained in a different language so that a suspect cannot command the dog against the officer.

Dogs used in law enforcement are trained to either be &quot;single purpose&quot; or &quot;dual purpose&quot;. Single-purpose dogs are used primarily for backup, personal protection, and tracking. Dual-purpose dogs, however, are more typical. Dual-purpose dogs do everything that single-purpose dogs do, and also detect either explosives or narcotics. Dogs can only be trained for one or the other because the dog cannot communicate to the officer if it found explosives or narcotics. When a narcotics dog in the United States indicates to the officer that it found something, the officer has probable cause to search whatever the dog alerted on (i.e. bag or vehicle) without a warrant, in most states.

In suspect apprehension, having a loud barking dog is helpful and can result in suspects surrendering without delay.

== Specialization ==
Police dogs can be specialized to perform in specific areas.

*Apprehension and attack dogs – This dog is used to locate, apprehend, and sometimes subdue suspects.
* Detection dogs – Trained to detect explosives or drugs such as marijuana, heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine, or methamphetamines. Some dogs are specifically trained to detect firearms and ammunition.
* Dual purpose dog – Also known as a patrol dog, these dogs are trained and skilled in tracking, handler protection, off-leash obedience, criminal apprehension, and article, area and building search.
* Search and rescue dogs (SAR) – This dog is used to locate suspects or find missing people or objects. Belgian Malinois, German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, and Bloodhounds can all be used.

==Retirement==

Police dogs are retired if they become injured to an extent where they will not recover completely, pregnant or raising puppies, or are too old or sick to continue working. Since many dogs are raised in working environments for the first year of their life and retired before they become unable to perform, the working life of a dog is 6–9 years.

However, when police dogs retire in some countries they may have the chance to receive a pension plan for their contribution to policing. In 2013, a pension scheme for police dogs in Nottinghamshire, England was introduced, wherein the police force offered £805 over the span of three years to cover any additional medical costs; the dogs were also allowed to be adopted by their original handler.

In many countries, police dogs killed in the line of duty receive the same honors as their human partners.

==Accusations of brutality and racial partiality==
A 2020 investigation coordinated by the Marshall Project found evidence of widespread deployment of police dogs in the U.S. as disproportionate force and disproportionately against people of color. A series of 13 linked reports found more than 150 cases from 2015 to 2020 of K-9 officers improperly using dogs as weapons to catch, bite, and injure people. The rate of police K-9 bites in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a majority-Black city of 220,000 residents, averages more than double that of the next-ranked city, Indianapolis, and nearly one-third of the police dog bites are inflicted on teenage men, most of whom are Black. Medical researchers found that police dog attacks are &quot;more like shark attacks than nips from a family pet&quot; due to the aggressive training police dogs undergo. Many people bitten were not violent and were not suspected of crimes. Police officers are often shielded from liability, and federal civil rights laws don&#x27;t typically cover bystanders who are bitten by mistake. Even when victims can bring cases, lawyers say they struggle because jurors tend to love police dogs.

<text>John Tayler (July 4, 1742 – March 19, 1829) was a merchant and politician. He served nine years as the lieutenant governor of New York, four months acting as the fifth governor of New York, and also in both houses of the New York State Legislature.

==Life==
He was a trader, farmer, and shopkeeper in Albany, New York. He married Margarita Van Valkenburgh in 1764.

Tayler was a Patriot during the Revolutionary War. He was drawn into public service for the Colonies.

Tayler was a member from Albany County in the New York State Assembly from 1777 to 1779, in 1780–81, and from 1785 to 1787. He was appointed City Recorder (Deputy Mayor) of Albany in 1793, and First Judge of the Albany County Court in 1797. In 1794, he was one of three minor Democratic-Republican candidates to challenge Federalist congressman Henry Glen, with each of the three receiving less than 3% of the vote. In 1798, he ran for U.S. Senator from New York, but was defeated by Federalist James Watson. He served in the New York State Senate from 1804 to 1813. On January 29, 1811, he was elected President pro tempore of the State Senate and was Acting Lieutenant Governor, Lt. Gov. John Broome having died in August 1810. He served until the end of June 1811 when he was succeeded by DeWitt Clinton who had been elected Lt. Gov. in a special election under the provisions of Article XX of the New York State Constitution of 1777.

Tayler was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1813, and re-elected in 1816, on the ticket with Daniel D. Tompkins. After Tompkins&#x27; resignation to assume the office of Vice President of the United States, Tayler served as Acting Governor from February 24 to June 30, 1817.

Article XVII of the New York State Constitution of 1777 states &quot;...as often as the seat of government shall become vacant, a wise and descreet freeholder of this State shall be, by ballot, elected governor..., which elections shall be always held at the times and places of choosing representatives in assembly...&quot; This meant that, whenever a vacancy occurred, the Lt. Gov. did not succeed to the governor&#x27;s office but administrated the state only until the end of the yearly term of the New York State Assembly on June 30, the successor being elected in April. This was the only occurrence of a vacancy of the governor&#x27;s office under this Constitution, and in April 1817 DeWitt Clinton was elected Governor. Tayler was re-elected Lt. Gov. and re-elected in 1820.

The duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr in 1804 is linked to comments spoken by Hamilton at Tayler&#x27;s home in Albany, which were related in a letter written by Tayler&#x27;s son-in-law, Dr. Charles D. Cooper, which was later published in an Albany newspaper.

Tayler was a presidential elector in 1828, voting for Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun.
Tayler died on March 19, 1829, in Albany. He was buried in Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.

<text>Margaret Marian McPartland OBE ( Turner; 20 March 1918 – 20 August 2013), was an English and American jazz pianist, composer, and writer. She was the host of &quot;Marian McPartland&#x27;s Piano Jazz&quot; on National Public Radio from 1978 to 2011.

After her marriage to trumpeter Jimmy McPartland in February 1945, she resided in the United States when not travelling throughout the world to perform. In 1969, she founded Halcyon Records, a recording company that issued albums for 10 years. In 2000, she was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master. In 2004, she was given a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement. In 2007, she was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. Although known mostly for jazz, she composed other types of music as well, performing her own symphonic work &quot;A Portrait of Rachel Carson&quot; with the University of South Carolina Symphony Orchestra in 2007. In 2010, she was named a member of the Order of the British Empire.

==Early life==
Margaret Marian Turner was born on 20 March 1918 to Frank and Janet (née Payne) Turner in Slough, Buckinghamshire, west of central London, England. She had one younger sibling, a sister, Joyce. She demonstrated early aptitude at the piano, and would later realize that she had perfect pitch. Margaret (Maggie to her family) studied violin from the age of nine, but never took to the instrument. She also trained as a vocalist and received a number of favorable reviews in the local paper. Janet refused to find her daughter a piano teacher until the age of 16, by which time Margaret was already adept at learning songs by ear. This lack of early education meant that Margaret was never a strong reader of notated music, and would always prefer to learn through listening.

Turner studied at Miss Hammond&#x27;s School for Young Children from 1924 to 1927, Avonclyffe from 1927 to 1929, Holy Trinity Convent from 1929 to 1933, and finally Stratford House for Girls from 1933 to 1935. There, she met Doris Mackie, a teacher who would be hugely influential on her. Mackie suggested to the Turners that Margaret should apply to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, since she clearly had an aptitude and passion for music. She was accepted in the spring of 1935 on the merit of her &quot;rampant enthusiasm, God-given faculty, and a dangerous surplus of imagination&quot; and in spite of the fact that she was &quot;sadly lacking in technique.&quot;

==Early career (Europe)==

Turner pursued studies at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where she worked toward a performance degree that would enable her to become a concert pianist, though she also did coursework in vocal performance. She studied with Orlando Morgan, who also taught Myra Hess. Turner&#x27;s talents for improvisation and composition were recognized early when she won the Wainwright Memorial Scholarship for Composition, the Worshipful Company of Musicians Composition Scholarship, and the Chairman&#x27;s School Composition Prize in 1936 and 1937. Much to her family&#x27;s dismay, she developed a love for American jazz and musicians such as Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, Teddy Wilson, and Mary Lou Williams, among others. In 1938, Turner sought out Billy Mayerl at his School of Modern Syncopation to seek lessons, and was convinced to audition for his piano quartet. Despite her family&#x27;s efforts to keep her at Guildhall, Turner left to join Billy Mayerl&#x27;s Claviers, a four-piano vaudeville act. There, she elected to perform under the stage name of Marian Page. She promised her family that she would one day return to finish her degree at Guildhall. After the Claviers tour, Marian returned to London in the fall of 1938 and played sporadically for shows and on the &quot;Carroll Lewis Show&quot;. To avoid conscription during World War II, she volunteered for the Entertainment National Service Association (ENSA), a group that was playing for Allied troops, in fall 1940. In 1944, her friend Zonie Dale recommended that Marian join the United Service Organizations (USO) because they paid more and played with American men.

With the USO, Marian went through basic training and was issued a set of combat gear – GI boots, helmet, and uniform. Marian was assigned to a group called the Band Wagon, which followed the Allied forces after the D-Day invasion. In anticipation of wartime demands, Marian learned to play the accordion in the event that there was no piano available with which to play for the troops.

In St Vith, Belgium, on 14 October 1944, Marian met a Chicago cornetist named Jimmy McPartland at a jam session. McPartland had volunteered for the army and was serving active duty when his superiors realized that he could do better work as an entertainer, since he was well known among the troops. Jimmy was solicited to put together a sextet to entertain the troops, and invited Marian to join him as their pianist. They soon fell in love, and signed an official US Army marriage document on 14 December 1944. They married on 3 February 1945, in Aachen, Germany, and played at their own military base wedding. Her marriage to an American male automatically gave Marian US citizenship, side by side with her British citizenship. Marian was reluctant to tell her parents of the marriage, and had Jimmy&#x27;s commanding officer tell them when he had lunch with them in England in early 1945. It was with Jimmy that Marian began her first real training in jazz. Jimmy and Marian did their first recording together on 6 January 1946 in London before leaving for the US. They arrived in New York City on 23 April 1946, and Marian would never live outside of the US again. However, she kept her British citizenship throughout her life.

==Early career (Chicago 1946–50 and New York City 1950–62)==

After the war, Marian and Jimmy moved to Chicago to be near his family. Jimmy was raised in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago, and was an original member of the Austin High Gang that played Chicago-style Dixieland jazz in the 1920s. In June 1946, Marian made her American debut at the Moose Lodge. Soon, Jimmy&#x27;s group, which now included Marian, landed a standing gig at the Rose Bowl through the end of 1946. This engagement was followed by ones at Taboo, Capitol Lounge, and finally Brass Rail. Marian flourished in Jimmy&#x27;s group, and by her association with him. They played at clubs like Blue Note and Silhouette with stars like Billie Holiday.

During their Chicago years, Jimmy and Marian visited France in 1949 for the Paris Jazz Festival. This was semi-important for their association with the European jazz scene, but more significant because it marked the beginning of Marian&#x27;s writing career. Marian&#x27;s testimonial about the festival ran in the July 1949 issue of &quot;DownBeat&quot;.

In 1949, the McPartlands settled in Manhattan, living in an apartment in the same building as the Nordstrom Sisters. In 1950, she announced that she would no longer go by her stage name, Marian Page, but would now go by her married name, Marian McPartland. With Jimmy&#x27;s help and encouragement, Marian started her own trio, which started performing at the newly opened 54th street club called The Embers on 8 May 1951. Here, she learned how to lead her own group, and played with musicians such as Roy Eldridge, Coleman Hawkins, and Terry Gibbs. After trying out different combos, she settled on a trio of piano, bass, and drums that would soon become standard. This gig led to a laudatory &quot;DownBeat&quot; profile by Leonard Feather, an advocate for women in jazz, who wrote that French fans would be unlikely to accept her because &quot;She is English, white and a girl--three hopeless strikes against her from the Gallic angle. Yet, if you ask Coleman Hawkins...or any of the other cats...you&#x27;ll know from their enthusiasm that ...She&#x27;s a fine, swinging pianist...&quot; (McPartland sometimes loosely paraphrased Feather as saying &quot;Oh, she&#x27;ll never make it: she&#x27;s English, white and a woman.&quot;) She signed her first record deal without Jimmy in 1951, with Savoy Records.
On 2 February 1952, McPartland opened a gig at the Hickory House that continued regularly through November 1962. During her time at the Hickory House, Duke Ellington would often be in the audience. Ellington was influential on McPartland&#x27;s development as a pianist, and told her she played too many notes, a sentiment she would take to heart. The drummer Joe Morello joined the group in 1953 and was a member of the trio until he departed to join Dave Brubeck&#x27;s Quartet in late 1956. In December 1953, Bill Crow replaced Vinnie Burke as her bass player. This trio of McPartland, Morello, and Crow would stay together through 1956, and be named Small Group of the Year by &quot;Metronome&quot; in 1954. The success of this trio would lead to the signing of McPartland to Capitol Records for five albums. The group of McPartland, Crow, and Morello would become McPartland&#x27;s best-known trio. It has been argued that McPartland never received the acclaim she deserved because she never stayed with any sidemen long enough to develop a unique sound, her 1953-1956 group being the exception to this rule.

In 1956, McPartland and Morello began an affair that would continue for almost ten years. In late 1956, Morello&#x27;s wife discovered their affair, and Brubeck hired Morello away.

McPartland continued writing testimonial pieces for journals such as &quot;Down Beat&quot; after the favorable reception of her first piece in 1949. Toward the end of the 1950s, she began to write about the issue of being a woman in jazz. She questioned &quot;Can&#x27;t we women make our own contribution to jazz by playing like women, but still capturing the essential elements of jazz – good beat – good ideas – honesty and true feeling?&quot;

In the 1953–54 season, McPartland appeared as a regular on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Judge for Yourself&quot; quiz program emceed by Fred Allen.
In 1958 a black and white group portrait of 57 notable jazz musicians, including McPartland, was photographed in front of a brownstone in Harlem, New York City. Art Kane, a freelance photographer working for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, took the photo, which was called, &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot;, and it became a well-known image of New York&#x27;s jazz musicians of the time. Immediately preceding her death in August 2013, she was one of only four of the 57 participating musicians who were still alive. After many years of recording for labels such as Capitol, Savoy, Argo, Sesac, Time, and Dot, in 1969 she founded her own record label, Halcyon Records, before having a long association with the Concord label. Marian and Jimmy divorced in 1972, but they remained close, and remarried in 1991, shortly before Jimmy&#x27;s death.

==Mid-career (New York City 1962–78)==
After McPartland&#x27;s Hickory House engagement ended, Benny Goodman offered her a spot in his septet for his 1963 tour. It quickly became clear that Goodman did not like her more modern playing style, and she shifted out of the full septet to play exclusively in the trio numbers. The physical and emotional strain of the last few years weighed hard on Marian during the stressful tour, and she checked herself into the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas for two weeks as an outpatient when the tour finished. There, she was referred to Dr. William Benjamin, a psychotherapist who would counsel her for many years.

McPartland&#x27;s counselling with Benjamin eventually led her to a number of important choices, the first being the decision to end her affair with Morello in the spring of 1964. The second was her decision to divorce Jimmy in the summer of 1967, a separation that was made public in December of the same year. Despite their divorce, Marian and Jimmy would remain close friends and eventually remarry weeks before Jimmy&#x27;s 1991 death.

In the late 1960s, McPartland began reviewing albums for &quot;DownBeat&quot;. During 1966–69, she reviewed 34 albums. Her perspective was unique, because she approached the review from her background as a peer musician. After 1969, she stopped reviewing, but continued to write instructional pieces. In May 1966, she began hosting a weekly radio show called &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; that aired for two hours each Saturday. The show began as a traditional program, but soon shifted to include interviews as well. These interviews and connections would prove to be an important precursor to McPartland&#x27;s &quot;Piano Jazz&quot; series.

Marian struggled to connect to the avant-garde jazz of the late 1960s, though she did endeavor to learn and adapt the free jazz style for her own use. She was not in high demand as a performer through the 1960s, and her focus shifted to focus on jazz education. Marian became aware of the need for jazz education when she was convinced to do a workshop at a high school in Rochester, New York, in 1956. She realized that the adolescents were totally unaware of jazz, and utterly enamored with the new rock and roll sweeping the country. In 1964, she began teaching at jazz clinics organized by Clem DeRosa, one of her former drummers. DeRosa was developing a jazz curriculum in the Huntington, New York school district. In 1966, DeRosa received a grant that allowed him to further develop his method, and he moved to the Cold Spring Harbor High School. Through this grant, he was able to pay Marian full-time to teach with him through 1967. McPartland continued to work in jazz education throughout the following decade. One of her most challenging projects was in 1974 when she received a Washington DC grant to teach in poor black neighborhoods. McPartland would be recognized for her work in jazz education in 1986, when she received the Jazz Educator of the Year award. She would continue to teach and judge jazz festivals for young people for the rest of her life.

During an engagement at the Apartment, a New York club, in February 1967 she met Alec Wilder, a man with whom she would develop a great friendship and who would encourage her to write and compose. They encountered each other again when Marian was touring in Rochester and began a collaboration that would become important, though difficult, for both of them. In 1974, Marian recorded an album, &quot;Marian McPartland Plays the Music of Alec Wilder&quot;, which was released by Halcyon Records.

After many years of recording for labels such as Capitol, Savoy, Argo Records, Sesac, Time, Design, and Dot Records, in 1969 McPartland co-founded her own record label, Halcyon Records. She would later have a long association with the Concord Records label. McPartland founded Halcyon with Sherman Fairchild and Hank O&#x27;Neal. They joined with a mind to produce the work of underrated or underrepresented jazz artists. Their first album was &quot;Interplay&quot;, a McPartland–Linc Milliman (bass) album of duets. Fairchild died in 1971, and McPartland bought out O&#x27;Neal in order to maintain the label for self-distribution or other projects. The last Halcyon album was released in 1979.

By 1977, McPartland had become a public advocate for women in jazz, and headlined the first Women&#x27;s Jazz Festival, which took place in Kansas City, 17–19 March 1978. In the late &#x27;70s, Marian performed internationally, including appearances in Asia, Europe, South America, and across the United States. McPartland rarely used women in her combos, but she helped many young women find their feet in the jazz business such as Mary Fettig (first female musician in the Stan Kenton band) and Susannah McCorkle.

McPartland appears in the 5 December 1977 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; – Goings on About Town, &quot;presides over the keyboard in the Bemelmans Bar (at the Carlyle Hotel) Mondays through Saturdays from nine-thirty to one (a.m.).&quot; It&#x27;s likely this was a gig she held for a time in 1977.

In 1978, McPartland performed Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto in A Minor with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra. Though the performance was poorly reviewed by most critics, she went on to perform the work with many symphonies across the country. Due to her poor sight-reading skills, she learned the piece principally by ear.

==Late career (&quot;Piano Jazz&quot; and on)==
In 1964, Marian McPartland launched a new venture on WBAI-FM (New York City), conducting a weekly radio program that featured recordings and interviews with guests. Pacifica Radio&#x27;s West Coast stations also carried this series, which paved the way for &quot;Marian McPartland&#x27;s Piano Jazz&quot;, a National Public Radio (NPR) series that began recording on 8 October 1978 and premiered on 1 April 1979 on WLTR (South Carolina) and was offered nationally by NPR. McPartland was offered the opportunity primarily on the recommendation of her friend Alec Wilder, who hosted &quot;American Popular Song&quot; until his health prevented him from continuing the program. &quot;Piano Jazz&quot; was the longest-running cultural program on NPR, as well as one of the longest-running jazz programs ever produced on public radio. The theme, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, was an original composition by McPartland. The program featured McPartland at the keyboard with guest performers, usually pianists, but also singers, guitarists, other musicians, and even the author Studs Terkel, who was not a musician. The first show aired 1 April 1979, with guest Mary Lou Williams. Several &quot;Piano Jazz&quot; programs have been released on CD by Concord Records.

In 1984, &quot;Piano Jazz&quot; received the Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting. In 1986, it won both the Gabriel Award and the NY Gold Medal Awards.

She celebrated the 25th anniversary of the NPR series with a live taping at the Kennedy Center for which Peter Cincotti was the guest. After not having recorded a new show since September 2010, on 10 November 2011, NPR announced that McPartland was stepping down as host of &quot;Piano Jazz&quot;. She then asked her long-time friend, jazz pianist Jon Weber, to carry on with the show. As a result, &quot;Piano Jazz: Rising Stars&quot;, an NPR series hosted by Weber, began broadcast on 3 January 2012. &quot;Piano Jazz&quot; soon returned to the air in repeat broadcasts.
Due to Marian&#x27;s increased profile, mostly from the success of &quot;Piano Jazz&quot;, she began booking increasingly prestigious shows and recording more often. McPartland was beloved for bringing in an underrepresented demographic to jazz clubs. She also used her celebrity to champion young artists and feature them in her combos.

In 1979, McPartland received an NEH grant to write a book about women in jazz, focusing specifically on The International Sweethearts of Rhythm. This endeavor was further supported with a 1980 Guggenheim Fellowship. Although she published a provisional essay in June 1980, she struggled to complete her book. In the early &#x27;80s, many books were published about the rise of women in jazz, including interviews with many of the same people that she interviewed, thereby reducing the novelty of her own research. She eventually published a collection of 13 essays, &quot;All in Good Time&quot;, in 1987. She attempted to write her autobiography for many years, with the encouragement of Alec Wilder, but never completed the project.

==Death and legacy==

&quot;DownBeat&quot; honored McPartland with a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994.

McPartland was awarded a Grammy in 2004, a Trustees&#x27; Lifetime Achievement Award, for her work as an educator, writer, and host of NPR Radio&#x27;s long-running &quot;Marian McPartland&#x27;s Piano Jazz&quot;. Although a master at adapting to her guest&#x27;s musical styles and having a well-known affinity for beautiful and harmonically rich ballads, she also recorded many tunes of her own. Her compositions included &quot;Ambiance&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;ll Be Other Times&quot;, &quot;With You in Mind&quot;, &quot;Twilight World&quot;, and &quot;In the Days of Our Love&quot;.

Just before her 90th birthday, McPartland composed and performed a symphonic piece, &quot;A Portrait of Rachel Carson&quot;, to mark the centennial of the environmental pioneer.

McPartland was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 New Year Honours, &quot;For services to jazz and to aspiring young musicians in the USA&quot;.

McPartland&#x27;s encyclopaedic knowledge of jazz standards, highly musical ear, involvement in over 60 years of evolving jazz styles, and rich experience blending with radio guests led to a musical style that was described as &quot;flexible and complex, and almost impossible to pigeonhole.&quot; She was known as a harmonically and rhythmically complex and inventive improviser. &quot;She was never content to be in one place, and always kept improving. She has great ears and great harmonics. Because of her ear, she can go into two or three different keys in a tune and shift with no problem.&quot;

McPartland was also a synesthete, associating different musical keys with colours, stating that &quot;The key of D is daffodil yellow, B major is maroon, and B flat is blue.&quot;

McPartland died at her home in Port Washington, New York on 20 August 2013. She was 95.

<text>John Morgan (1929–1988) was a Welsh journalist and broadcaster. Morgan worked for the BBC as a presenter on programmes such as &quot;Panorama&quot;, and wrote for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, among other publications.

== Early life ==
Morgan was born in Treboeth, Swansea, grew up in Morriston and attended the University College of Swansea.

== Career ==
In 1961 he interviewed Aldous Huxley in a one-off TV film of the same name, about modern society, Christianity, his life in the USA, his friend D. H. Lawrence, and giving up the search for utopia.

Morgan wrote the librettos for two television operas produced by HTV: Alun Hoddinott&#x27;s &quot;The Magician&quot; (1976), and Norman Kay&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1978).

When Morgan was diagnosed with terminal cancer, he made a film for the 4 episode Channel 4 series &quot;Concerning Cancer&quot;, documenting his experience. His film titled &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, won the 1989 Grierson Award for &quot;Best Documentary.&quot; A collection of his articles was published posthumously in 1993.

<doc id="537885" wikidata="Q452147" url="?curid=537885" title="Sarah Vowell">
<text>Sarah Jane Vowell (born December 27, 1969) is an American historian, author, journalist, essayist, social commentator and actress. She has written seven nonfiction books on American history and culture. Vowell was a contributing editor for the radio program &quot;This American Life&quot; on Public Radio International from 1996 to 2008, where she produced commentaries and documentaries. She was the voice of Violet Parr in the 2004 animated film &quot;The Incredibles&quot; and its 2018 sequel.

==Early life and education==
Sarah Vowell was born in Muskogee, Oklahoma on December 27, 1969. Her family moved to Bozeman, Montana when she was eleven. She has a fraternal twin sister, Amy. Vowell graduated from Bozeman High School. She earned a B.A. from Montana State University in 1993 in Modern Languages and Literature, and an M.A. in Art History from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1999.

==Career==
===Writing===
Vowell&#x27;s articles have been published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Spin Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;SF Weekly&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. She has been a regular contributor to the online magazine &quot;Salon.com&quot;, and was one of the original contributors to &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s&quot;, participating in many of the quarterly&#x27;s readings and shows.

Vowell&#x27;s first book, &quot;Radio On: A Listener&#x27;s Diary&quot; (1997), which featured her year-long diary of listening to the radio in 1995, caught the attention of &quot;This American Life&quot; host Ira Glass, and it led to Vowell becoming a frequent contributor to the show. Thereafter, segments on the show became the subjects for many of her subsequent published essays. Vowell&#x27;s first essay collection was &quot;Take the Cannoli&quot; (2000), which was followed by &quot;The Partly Cloudy Patriot&quot; (2002).

In 2005, Vowell served as a guest columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot; during several weeks in July, briefly filling in for Maureen Dowd. She again served as a guest columnist in February 2006. Her book &quot;Assassination Vacation&quot; (2005) describes a road trip to tourist sites devoted to the murders of presidents Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield and William McKinley. Vowell&#x27;s book, &quot;The Wordy Shipmates&quot; (2008), analyzes the settlement of the New England Puritans in America and their contributions to American history. Also in 2008, Vowell&#x27;s essay about Montana appeared in the book &quot;State by State: A Panoramic Portrait of America&quot;.

Vowell wrote &quot;Unfamiliar Fishes&quot; (2011), which discusses the Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the Newlands Resolution. In April 2011, the book became a New York Times Bestseller. In her Los Angeles Times review, Susan Salter Reynolds wrote that Vowell&#x27;s &quot;cleverness is gorgeously American: She collects facts and stores them like a nervous chipmunk, digesting them only for the sake of argument.&quot; Allegra Goodman, writing in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, describes the work as &quot;a big gulp of a book, printed as an extended essay... Lacking section or chapter breaks, Vowell&#x27;s quirky history lurches from one anecdote to the next. These are often entertaining, but in the aggregate they begin to sound the same...&quot;, adding that &quot;Vowell tells a good tale&quot; with &quot;shrewd observations&quot;, but that &quot;the narrative wears thin where casual turns cute and cute threatens to turn glib.&quot;

Her most recent book is &quot;Lafayette in the Somewhat United States&quot; (2015), an account of the Marquis de Lafayette, a French aristocrat who became George Washington&#x27;s trusted officer and friend, and afterward an American celebrity. In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Charles P. Pierce wrote, &quot;Vowell wanders through the history of the American Revolution and its immediate aftermath, using Lafayette&#x27;s involvement in the war as a map, and bringing us all along in her perambulations… and doing it with a wink.&quot; NPR reviewer Colin Dwyer wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s awfully refreshing to see Vowell bring our founders down from their lofty pedestals. In her telling, they&#x27;re just men again, not the gods we&#x27;ve long since made of them.&quot;

===Public appearances and lectures===

Vowell has appeared on television shows including &quot;Nightline&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

In April 2006, Vowell served as the keynote speaker at the 27th Annual Kentucky Women Writers Conference. In August and September 2006, she toured the United States as part of the &quot;Revenge of the Book Eaters&quot; national tour, which benefited the children&#x27;s literacy centers 826NYC, 826CHI, 826 Valencia, 826LA, 826 Michigan, and 826 Seattle.

Vowell provided commentary in Robert Wuhl’s 2005 &quot;Assume the Position with Mr. Wuhl&quot; HBO specials.

===Voice and acting work===
Vowell provided the voice of Violet Parr, a shy teenager, in the 2004 Pixar animated film &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, and returned to her role for the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Incredibles 2&quot;, in 2018. She voiced the character in related video games, and for &quot;Disney on Ice&quot; presentations. Director Brad Bird heard Vowell on &quot;This American Life&quot;, &quot;Guns&quot;, (in which she and her father fire a homemade cannon) and determined that Vowell’s voice fit the character. Pixar made a test animation for Violet using audio from that sequence, which was included on the DVD of &quot;The Incredibles&quot;. Vowell wrote and was featured in a documentary included on the same DVD, entitled &quot;Vowellett—An Essay by Sarah Vowell&quot;, in which she reflects on the difference between being an author of history books on assassinated presidents and voicing the superhero Violet, and on what the role meant to her nephew.

Vowell featured prominently in the 2002 documentary about the alternative rock band They Might Be Giants, entitled &quot;Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns&quot;, and she appeared with band members John Linnell and John Flansburgh in the DVD commentary for the movie. She provided commentary for the April 2006 episode &quot;Murder at the Fair: The Assassination of President McKinley,&quot; one of ten in the History Channel miniseries &quot;10 Days That Unexpectedly Changed America.&quot;

In September 2006, Vowell appeared as a minor character in the ABC drama &quot;Six Degrees&quot;. She appeared in an episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Bored to Death&quot;, as an interviewer in a bar, and in 2010, appeared briefly in the film &quot;Please Give&quot;, as a shopper. Vowell appeared on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; as a Senior Historical Context Correspondent.

==Personal life==
Vowell writes that she has a small amount of Cherokee Nation ancestry (about 1/8 on her mother&#x27;s side and 1/16 on her father&#x27;s side). She is not a citizen of the Cherokee Nation or any other tribe. She retraced the path of the forced removal of the Cherokee from the southeastern United States to Oklahoma, known as the Trail of Tears, with her twin sister Amy. In 1998, &quot;This American Life&quot; chronicled her story, devoting the entire hour to her work. 
Vowell spent many vacations with her sister and nephew visiting historical sites. As a child she attended church three times a week and seldom travelled.

She has described herself as a “culturally Christian atheist”.

Vowell lives in Manhattan, New York. She is on the advisory board of 826NYC, a nonprofit tutoring and writing center for students aged 6–18 in Brooklyn.

<text>The Cleveland Botanical Garden, located in the University Circle neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States.

==History==
The origins of the Cleveland Botanical Gardens began to bloom in 1916 when Eleanor Squire donated horticultural books to the Garden Club in Cleveland. The garden itself was founded in 1930 as the Garden Center of Greater Cleveland. It was the first such civic garden in an American city. Originally housed in a converted boathouse on Wade Park Lagoon, the center served as a horticultural library, offering classes and workshops for gardeners and spearheading beautification projects in the community.

In 1966 having outgrown its original home, the Garden Center moved to its present location in University Circle, the site of the old Cleveland Zoo. Remnants of the old bear pit still remain in the Ohio Woodland Garden. The move occurred after nearly six years of heavy springtime flooding in University Circle. That same year, the boathouse was damaged from the onslaught of flooding and the boathouse was demolished. Due to the damage to the boathouse and other structures in University Circle, a city initiative to install sewers and interceptors to control future flooding were installed near the Circle.

In 1994, the organization&#x27;s Board of Trustees changed the name from Garden Center of Greater Cleveland to Cleveland Botanical Garden to reflect a dramatically expanded mission and launched an ambitious capital campaign to develop a facility that would support the enhanced program agenda. The expanded and renovated building, designed by Graham Gund Architects of Cambridge, Massachusetts, opened to the public in July 2003. The Cleveland Botanical Garden expanded again in 2014 when it joined forces with the Holden Arboretum. The two entities joined and became Holden Forest &amp; Gardens. As of 2024, visitors of the Cleveland Botanical Garden can enjoy the extensive horticultural museum, special events, an indoor-outdoor all season botanical experience, and much more. The Gardens also supports environmental research, community outreach, and urban farming programs.

==Facilities==

The centerpiece of the $50 million 2003 expansion is The Eleanor Armstrong Smith Glasshouse, a 17,000 square foot (1,700 m²) conservatory home to plant and animal life from two separate biomes, the spiny desert of Madagascar and the cloud forest of Costa Rica. They feature over 350 species of plants and 50 species of animals, including hundreds of butterflies.

There are also of gardens, including the award-winning Hershey Children&#x27;s Garden (the first children&#x27;s garden in Ohio), the Elizabeth and Nona Evans Restorative Garden, the David and Paula Swetland Topiary Garden, the Western Reserve Herb Society Garden, the Japanese Garden, the Sears-Swetland Rose Garden, the Ohio Woodland, the C.K. &quot;Pat&quot; Patrick Perennial Border, and the public Campsey-Stauffer Gateway Garden.

==Awards==
The Vail Medal is awarded for &quot;significant national contributions to the field of horticulture&quot; Past winners include Lynden B. Miller

==In popular culture==
The gardens were featured in a fifth-season episode of &quot;Supernatural&quot;, titled &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

<doc id="537892" wikidata="Q841613" url="?curid=537892" title="Civil death">
<text>Civil death () is the loss of all or almost all civil rights by a person due to a conviction for a felony or due to an act by the government of a country that results in the loss of civil rights. It is usually inflicted on persons convicted of crimes against the state or adults determined by a court to be legally incompetent because of mental disability.

==Medieval Europe==
In medieval Europe, felons lost all civil rights upon their conviction. This civil death often led to actual death, since anyone could kill and injure a felon with impunity. Under the Holy Roman Empire, a person declared civilly dead was referred to as &quot;vogelfrei&quot; (&#x27;free as a bird&#x27;) and could even be killed since they were completely outside the law.

Historically outlawry, that is, declaring a person as an outlaw, was a common form of civil death.

Under early English common law a living person could under certain conditions be considered legally dead. The three categories generally recognized as resulting in civil death were profession (&quot;monastery death&quot;), abjuration, and banishment.

==United States==
In the U.S., the disenfranchisement of felons has been called a form of civil death, as has being subjected to collateral consequences in general. The contention is not generally supported by legal scholars. Civil death as such remains part of the law in New York, Rhode Island, and the Virgin Islands.

==China==
The deprivation of political rights is a supplementary punishment defined in the Criminal Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. While this punishment is usually issued for at least one but not more than five years in conjunction with other crimes, such as counterrevolution, there are situations where the deprivation of political rights can be issued on its own or for longer periods:
*For those sentenced to life imprisonment or capital punishment, the deprivation of political rights is lifelong;
*Those who assemble a crowd for &quot;beating, smashing, or looting&quot; can be issued an exclusive punishment of deprivation of political rights.

===Political rights===
Political rights are defined in the Criminal Law as:
*the right to vote and to stand for election;
*the rights of freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of demonstration;
*the right to hold a position in a state organization; and
*the right to hold a leading position in any state-owned company, enterprise, institution or people&#x27;s organization.

*Disfranchisement
*Loss of rights due to felony conviction
*Sex offender registries in the United States
*Social death
*&quot;Ghosts… of the Civil Dead&quot;
*Homo Sacer, a similar status in ancient Roman Law

<text>Clergy reserves were tracts of land in Upper Canada and Lower Canada reserved for the support of &quot;Protestant clergy&quot; by the Constitutional Act 1791. One-seventh of all surveyed Crown lands were set aside, totaling and respectively for each province, and provision was made to dedicate some of those reserved lands as glebe land in support of any parsonage or rectory that may be established by the Church of England. The provincial legislatures could vary or repeal these provisions, but royal assent could not be given before such passed bills having been laid before both houses of the British Parliament for at least thirty days.

==Upper Canada==
The first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, interpreted &quot;Protestant clergy&quot; to mean the clergy of Church of England only. However, in 1823 the Law Officers of the Crown held that the Church of Scotland was also entitled to a share of the revenues under the 1791 Act. Although Lt-Governor Maitland attempted to suppress the publication of that decision, the Legislature passed resolutions the following year that recognized that church&#x27;s status.

Complications in establishing leasing procedures prevented the reserve lands from being leased before 1803. Until 1819, the reserve lands were managed by the Province, and in most years they earned revenues that were barely sufficient to cover their expenses. After the Rev. John Strachan was appointed to the Executive Council of Upper Canada in 1815, he began to push for the Church of England&#x27;s autonomous control of the clergy reserves on the model of the Clergy Corporation of Lower Canada, created in 1817. The Clergy Corporation, of which Strachan became the chairman, was subsequently incorporated in 1819 to manage the clergy reserves.

The 1819 charter (drafted by Strachan&#x27;s former student, Attorney General John Beverly Robinson) provided for the Bishop of Quebec to become the perpetual Principal and Director (as he was for the Lower Canada body), who, with twelve other directors, constituted the Board. The Bishop&#x27;s Official (named by the Bishop) and the rectors of Niagara and York could each serve as acting chairman.

Other perpetual directors were:

:* the incumbents at Kingston, Niagara, York, Cornwall, Grimsby, Ancaster and Hamilton; and
:* the Inspector General and Surveyor General of the Province of Upper Canada.

Any two directors, together with the Principal or an acting chairman, constituted a quorum, but, because of the poor network of roads, most clergy members were generally unable to attend Corporation meetings. This effectively meant that Strachan (as rector of York), together with the Inspector General and Surveyor General, controlled the Board. These three members were part of the Family Compact, of which Strachan was the leader.

The reserves were allotted in lots of , generally intermixed with other lots sold to individuals within each surveyed township. Except in the Talbot Settlement (where they were located off the main roads), they were generally arranged in a checkerboard pattern within each township, and were a serious obstacle to economic development as they were effectively , either being abandoned by lessees after the timber had been fully harvested, or unattractive because of the availability of cheap freehold land. This was recognized by the Legislative Assembly in 1817 when it passed resolutions that condemned the lands as &quot;insurmountable obstacles&quot; and called on the Parliament in Westminster to authorize their sale.

Until 1827, no reserve lands were sold. They were leased for terms of twenty-one years, with rents on a sliding scale:

Even with higher rates being charged from 1819, total annual revenues were still only £1200 in 1824, and only one-third could be collected without pursuing legal action.

In 1826, the Canada Company was formed to sell off the remaining crown and clergy reserves in the province. However, because of opposition from Strachan, the Company received in the Huron Tract, in substitution for the originally contemplated of clergy reserve lands. As the provincial policy of free land grants had come to an end, Strachan lobbied for and secured an Act from the British Parliament granting authority to sell up to one-fourth of all reserve lands, up to each year, from which there would be income sufficient to support 200300 Anglican clergymen.

In 1836, before Sir John Colborne was succeeded by Sir Francis Bond Head as lieutenant-governor, he created 57 rectories for the Church of England, with glebe land totalling . This action created significant political dissent, and was subsequently declared illegal in 1837, but was later held in 1856 to have been lawful. In the interim, it became one of the issues in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837 (and subsequently identified as such in the 1838 report written by Lord Durham), where William Lyon Mackenzie exclaimed to the crowd outside Montgomery&#x27;s Tavern:

The Parliament of Upper Canada passed a bill to sell the reserves in 1840, but the Governor General reserved the bill for consideration by the British government, which disallowed the bill. The British then enacted the Clergy Reserves in Canada Act 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 78) later in that year. Although considered to be more favourable to the Church of England, the Act as passed provided that only one-half of future sales would be dedicated on a 2:1 basis to the Churches of England and Scotland, with the remaining half being distributed to all other churches according to their respective strengths. The administration of the reserve lands was transferred to the Crown Lands Department, where it was handled in a more professional manner.

==Lower Canada==

Unlike the distribution of lots that was pursued by Simcoe in Upper Canada, Alured Clarke, lieutenant-governor of Lower Canada, instituted a policy of setting aside large blocks of land apart from either current or contiguous settlement.

The Clergy Corporation in Lower Canada, more formally known as the &quot;Corporation for Superintending, Managing and Conducting the Clergy Reserves within the Province of Lower-Canada&quot;, was constituted with the Bishop of Quebec (initially the Right Rev. Jacob Mountain) as perpetual Principal and Director, and with rectors of four parishes within the diocese constituted as perpetual directors. In 1828, a British parliamentary committee reported that leases were being granted on certain terms:

The reserve lands generated little income in Lower Canada, with the average annual profit from such activity amounting to only £3 between 1791 and 1837.

==Abolition==
Pressure arose to reform the entire structure of the reserves, but the government of Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine chose not to proceed on such a course, because of the resistance of the established churches and the roadblocks presented by the 1791 Act. However, such caution eventually came to be seen as inflexibility, which would be overcome by the rise of the Grit movement in 1850.

Even as late as 1853, Strachan was still campaigning to ensure the Church of England&#x27;s dominance in the matter. As he stated in a letter to Lord Newcastle:

Following the victory of Augustin-Norbert Morin and Allan MacNab in the 1854 general election, in conjunction with the abolition of seigneurial tenure in Lower Canada, the lands were finally removed from church control and secularized under an Act of the Parliament of the Province of Canada, under which:

:* sales and other revenues from the reserves were constituted as separate funds dedicated to municipal purposes in Upper and Lower Canada, and
:* recipients of stipends could cede their life claims to their respective churches, which could in turn commute the sums of such claims at 6% &quot;per annum&quot;.

==Impact and aftermath==
Reform of the clergy reserves was a major issue in Canadian politics from its creation until its abolition. The controversy stemmed from the fact that many supporters of the religious endowment were part of the Tory ruling class. Even Robert Baldwin, who was the leader of the struggle for Responsible Government did not advocate for complete abolition and chose to resign his seat rather than tackle the question.

In 1867, the Municipalities Funds for Upper and Lower Canada were declared to be part of the joint property of the new provinces of Ontario and Quebec, subject to division and adjustment at a later date by arbitrators appointed under s. 142 of the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;. The funds were awarded to each province respectively in September 1870, and the award itself was held to be valid by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in March 1878. In Ontario, the Fund continued to be accounted for separately until the passage of an Act in 1908, where all special funds were declared to form part of the province&#x27;s Consolidated Revenue Fund.

<doc id="537898" wikidata="Q6249412" url="?curid=537898" title="John Morgan (poet)">
<text>John Morgan (also known as John Morgan Matchin or John Morgan of Matchin) (7 February 1688 – 28 February 1733 or 1734) was a Welsh clergyman, scholar and poet.

==Life==
Morgan was born at Llangelynnin, Merionethshire, the younger son of the local curate. He studied at Jesus College, Oxford, from 1704 to 1708, and is thought to have been influenced by Edward Lhuyd, the antiquary, whilst he was there. He was ordained in 1709 and spent a year as curate of Llandegfan, Anglesey. From 1710 to 1713, he was curate of Llanfyllin, Montgomeryshire, before becoming curate (1713) and then vicar (1728) of Matching, Essex, a position he held until his death in February 1733 or 1734. This led to his commonly being known as John Morgan Matchin. He was buried in the parish church in Matching.

==Work==
Morgan had a particular interest in Welsh literature, and was one of the &quot;London Welsh&quot;, a group intent on preserving and promoting Welsh culture in the capital, from around the time of his appointment to Matching. He wrote poetry, but was also a prose writer and translator. His best known work is &quot;&quot; (‘Devout musings on the four last things’), first published in 1714, became a minor classic, with an eighth edition appearing in 1830, almost one hundred years after his death. Other works include a collection of proverbs and colloquialisms and, it is thought, some translations of Tertullian and Cyprian published in 1716. He was concerned about the English-only education policy of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, saying in letters to his Oxford contemporary Moses Williams that the result would be &quot;barbarism&quot;. He also discussed matters of literature and antiquary, and these letters were studied later in the eighteenth century by those involved in the cultural revival of Wales at that time.

<text>Inva Mula (born 27 June 1963) is an Albanian opera lyric soprano. She began her soprano career at a very early age. Her father (Avni Mula) and mother () were also opera singers. She is also known for providing the voice of the diva Plavalaguna in the film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;.

==Life and career==
Mula was born in Tirana, Albania, to Avni Mula and Nina Mula. Avni was a Kosovo Albanian man from Gjakova while Nina was a Russian woman from Izhevsk. In 1987 she won the Cantante d&#x27;Albania competition in Tirana and in 1988 the George Enescu Competition in Bucharest. In 1992 she won the Butterfly competition in Barcelona. She received an award at Plácido Domingo&#x27;s first Operalia International Opera Competition in Paris, 1993. A CD of the event was released.

She later performed in various concerts at the Opéra Bastille in Paris, and in Brussels for Europalia Mexico, in Munich, and in Oslo. In 1996 she performed Luigi Cherubini&#x27;s opera &quot;Médée&quot; (which was taped for TV) at Compiègne in France. She then returned for Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;La jolie fille de Perth&quot; (released CD, filmed for TV, and released DVD in Japan) in 1998. After this she recorded Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La rondine&quot; with Angela Gheorghiu for EMI and for 2005&#x27;s stage production she took Gheorghiu&#x27;s place in the leading role of Magda during performances in Toulouse and Paris. Later on, she performed Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Ivan IV&quot; concert version, which had its recital debut at Salle Pleyel in Paris, and a live recording was released as CD. In 2001, she was busy in Italy, performing Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot; at the Teatro alla Scala and &quot;Rigoletto&quot; at the Verona Arena, both of which were taped for TV then released on DVD.

Mula has sung in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, and &quot;Manon&quot;, among others. She is also a renowned Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;, and has sung the role in many cities around the world, including Tokyo, Bilbao, Orange, Trieste, and Toronto. In 2007, she performed Adina in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; at Toulouse, and in 2009 she sang the title role in Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Mireille&quot; with the Paris Opera at the Palais Garnier, a performance that was issued on DVD. Also in 2009, she released the album &quot;Il Bel Sogno&quot;, a compilation of opera arias.

She is often accompanied by the French-Albanian pianist Genc Tukiçi.

Her ex-husband Pirro Çako is a well-known singer and composer from Albania, but she used the spelling Tchako rather than Çako. However, after mid-1990 she began using the name Inva Mula, and never returned to the old one. Her current husband is Hetem Ramadani, a businessman from Kosovo.

===In film===
Mula is perhaps best known to Western filmgoers as the singing voice of the Diva Plavalaguna, played on-screen by Maïwenn Le Besco, in the 1997 film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, where she is credited using her then married name as Inva Mula Çako. She performed the aria &quot;Il dolce suono&quot; from the mad scene of Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; and &quot;The Diva Dance&quot;.

Director Luc Besson adored Maria Callas, but the sound quality of her 1956 EMI Classics recording of &quot;Lucia&quot; wasn&#x27;t clear enough to use on a film soundtrack, so Callas&#x27;s agent Michel Glotz, who had produced this recording, introduced him to Mula.

<text>Todd Jay Weinstein (born 1951) is a photographer and artist, born in Detroit, Michigan, and who now lives in New York City. Todd&#x27;s first started photography back in high school in the mid 1960s. After graduating high school he studied at the Center for Creative Studies under his teacher George Phillips. Worked as 3rd assistant to the photographer Dick James studio in Detroit Michigan, after moving to New York City in 1970 Todd started working at the Gaslight folk music club which move to upstairs at Max&#x27;s Kansas City.

One goal of &quot;Darkness into Light&quot; was to &quot;add insight into the Jewish culture that is moving forward in post-Holocaust Germany.&quot; Mr. Weinstein&#x27;s work on that project led to the more abstract &quot;The Thirty-Six Unknown&quot; (cf. Lamed vov-niks). In 1994, Todd Weinstein was invited by the German government to be an artist in residence in Germany. After the photographs from that period were developed, he picked up the many threads of his past experiences and began using the photographs toward a project on the re-emergence of Jewish culture in Germany. Most recently he produced a documentary titled Making Their Mark for the German Consulate General of New York. Focuses on German American heritage celebrating 400 years of Germans coming to America. He is the co founder of http://www.onclicknyc.com and PROSPEKT. Todd 30 year retrospective at the Detroit Holocaust Memorial Center in Detroit showed, his work on Jewish themes titled “Light Is My Voice” Images, Legends and Abstractions.

Todd was also one of the founders and became the director of the Union Square Gallery 1980- 1990. Todd changed the gallery the name to The Union Square Gallery Ernst Haas viewing Room after Ernst death in 1986. The Gallery showed many different artists: Louis Stettner, Sid Kaplan, Maggie Steber, Eugene Richards, Ed Grazda, Barry Kornbluh, Tore Johnson, Tom Braun, Arlene Gottfried, Carlos Rena Perez, Sid Kaplan, to name a few, and artists from Detroit MI.Europe as well an outside curator Greg Master. The gallery showed emerging and famous artists with a community spirit. Todd working as a street photography which he published titled &quot;Personal journalism a Decade of Color Photography&quot; 1980–1990 to celebrate 10 years of the Union Square gallery Ernst Haas viewing Room.

<doc id="537926" wikidata="Q4834412" url="?curid=537926" title="B3ta">
<text>B3ta (stylised as b3ta) is a popular British website, described as a &quot;puerile digital arts community&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. It was founded in 2001 by Rob Manuel, Denise Wilton and Cal Henderson.

B3ta&#x27;s main feature is a newsletter featuring the latest work of the B3ta community and other interesting, humorous or perverse things found on the Web. The newsletter has about 100,000 readers. A message board allows members to post digital images and short animations they have created, the ones considered the best appearing on the front page, along with various announcements. Previously there was a B3ta radio show on the London station Resonance FM. 

Many popular Internet phenomena were created by B3ta members (also called &quot;b3tans or &quot;B3tards&quot;). These include the Macromedia Flash cartoons created by Joel Veitch and Jonti Picking, the surrealist animations by Cyriak Harris, and the quizzes by Rob Manuel.

A book entitled &quot;The Bumper B3ta Book of Sick Jokes&quot; was published in 2006, containing jokes compiled from B3ta contributors and a spin-off wiki humour website, Sickipedia.

== Message boards ==

===Main board===
On the main board, images and animated GIFs are posted by the members. The B3ta message board has a strong code of &quot;netiquette&quot; – a new thread should generally not be started unless it contains an image, made by that user and not previously posted to /board. Spamming (promoting a website purely for financial gain) is not tolerated.

Newly registered users cannot post on the board until the Tuesday after they register, known as &quot;Newbie Tuesday&quot;. This gives an opportunity to discover site etiquette before getting involved.

Internet memes are the lifeblood of B3ta messageboard. Meme is a name given to a clichéd image that is frequently used in images as a cheap gag. Although many older board members may resent the lack of originality shown by using these clichés, some, such as &quot;The Quo&quot; or &quot;The Fear&quot;, crop up regularly.

===Image Challenge===
This is a weekly Photoshop contest, where images are posted along a certain theme – examples include &quot;New Software Products&quot;, or &quot;The World If It Was Run By Kittens&quot;. The entries are posted as normal threads on the message board, but are marked with a &quot;C&quot; icon to differentiate from normal posts. Entries are collected in a central repository that can be browsed any time, with the highest voted images displayed first. Three &quot;special mentions&quot; are chosen by the site mods, and these are posted along with the theme of the new challenge in the Friday newsletter.

The challenge topics are alternately chosen by board members, and the &quot;Challenge Dictator&quot; (basically a site moderator) on a two-week cycle.

Image Challenge suggestions appear to be generally listed in order of posting, with the newest responses first. However, whilst a question is open, other users can click &quot;I like this!&quot; which gives a score of one point to that answer. Once a question is closed answers are listed by the number of users who have clicked the &quot;I like this!&quot; on that answer; however, as many answers are submitted each week, most are never clicked on and so are sorted by the time they were posted.

===Question of the Week (QOTW)===
Recognizing that &quot;not everyone wants to muck around with Photoshop&quot;, the site asks a question each week hoping to provoke amusing anecdotes. It was originally used as material for the radio show and the newsletter, but realising the popularity of the content, the site owners decided to continue the questions after the close of the show. A new topic is begun every Thursday (at which point it becomes impossible to reply to the previous QOTW) and, as with the other areas of the site, Question of the Week attracts regulars known for their characteristic posts. Each post is voted for in the same way as the image challenge.

The first question was &quot;Worst Record Ever?&quot; posed by Rob Manuel in 2003; examples of questions since include &quot;Why should you be fired from your job?&quot;, &quot;Mad Stuff You&#x27;ve Done To Get Someone To Sleep With You&quot; and &quot;Expensive mistakes&quot;.

QOTW Off Topic was invented for those users of QOTW who found they had things in common and liked to talk to each other using the reply system. Over several weeks it became clear that more and more people were preferring to chat to each other through the replies instead of the /talk board which was already set up, so Off Topic was created.

===Links board===
The links board is another section of the site that was created in response to an equivalent page on the 4rthur website. This board is a place for b3ta members to share interesting links they have found, in preference to the original practise of posting them on the main board. The links board has itself become a place for particular groups of b3tans ( or &quot;b3tards&quot;) to congregate, and for links specific memes to proliferate.

Posting something which is deemed to be clichéd is not tolerated. These cliché links are often referred to as &quot;glasscock&quot;, named after the famous image of a female golfer kissing a glass trophy, which appeared to be a phallic shape due to the camera angle. The best images of the day are displayed on the front page of the site, reaching many more people. The Board members vote by clicking a button labelled &quot;I like this!&quot;, then the site moderators pick their favourites.

===Talk board===
The talk board is identical to the main message board except for the fact that it is not possible to post images. It was created in response to the arrival of 4rthur, a (now defunct) talk based offshoot of b3ta which drew a couple of hundred members away, and, more recently, cliqr, Dynafoo (both also defunct now) and c4mbodia. Also, the site owners wanted a place where people could banter without worrying about creating images.

Like the many message boards, the b3ta talk board has developed a clique-like atmosphere, with many users having met one another at so called &quot;B3ta bashes&quot;. Oxford in particular has become known amongst members as a bash hotspot, and has developed from a few B3tards getting together for a drink to a genuine spectacle. On 31 May 2008, the biggest &quot;bash&quot; so far took place in Earls Court, London, although this was mainly a messageboard event.

==B3ta Radio==
From August 2003 until July 2004, B3ta had its own radio show, which was broadcast from Resonance FM (104.4 FM in London, also available via streaming broadcast from the Resonance FM website) between 4pm and 5pm. The show was presented by Rob Manuel, a co-owner of the site, and David Stevenson. There were often special guests – sometimes contributors to the site, sometimes semi-famous people, such as the drummer from Blur, Miles Hunt of The Wonder Stuff and &quot;a chap who once played a Dalek in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&quot;.

== &quot;The Bumper B3ta Book of Sick Jokes&quot; and Sickipedia ==
In 2006, independent publishers The Friday Project and B3ta launched a venture to publish a collection of &quot;sick jokes&quot; gathered from B3ta contributors. A public wiki site named &quot;Sickipedia&quot; (a pun on &quot;Wikipedia&quot;) was established to collect user-submitted humour for the book. The site encouraged submission of jokes intended to be bad taste or taboo, and entries were organised under a categorisation system of topics which included racism, jokes about celebrities, current affairs and sexual humour. Similarly to the main B3ta site, Sickipedia site functionality offered an electronic voting system to subject user submissions to a form of peer review.

The book, entitled &quot;The Bumper B3ta Book of Sick Jokes&quot;, was published on 20 October 2006 and was made available from both online and real-world bookshops. It claims to offer an &quot;antidote&quot; to political correctness. The book is now published by HarperCollins.

The Sickipedia site was sold in 2012. The new owners released an ebook and a print-on-demand book in 2014 entitled &quot;The Best Of Sickipedia: A Collection Of The Sickest, Most Offensive and Politically Incorrect Jokes&quot;, along with mobile apps. In February 2016, the Sickipedia website went offline due to a drive failure, resulting in the apps also failing.

==Controversy==
Virgin asked B3ta to run an image competition in which board members could win PlayStation Portables and an Xbox 360 for creating something on the theme &quot;What would happen if you said Yes to everything?&quot;. Virgin later cancelled the challenge early because they did not like some of the images being created, including Richard Branson urinating on Rob Manuel, dressed in baby clothes.

On 4 June 2007, a b3ta member posted an &quot;alternative logo&quot; for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, which referenced an image from the former shock site goatse. The BBC then posted this logo on its website and ran it on its BBC News 24 channel as part of a viewer-submitted contest.

In November 2007, lawyers acting for Prince threatened the site and its members with legal action over an image challenge.

A Sickipedia joke about stricken Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba on the evening of his cardiac arrest on the pitch at White Hart Lane caused outrage on Twitter. In February 2009, the site was criticized as &quot;monstrous&quot; for its jokes about the death of Francesca Anobile, and one of the site&#x27;s users reported &quot;very real threats of legal action&quot;. In October 2012, a 19-year-old from Chorley, Lancashire, was jailed for copying and pasting Sickipedia jokes about abducted children April Jones and Madeleine McCann onto Facebook.

<text>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., commonly known as Wiley (), is an American multinational publishing company that focuses on academic publishing and instructional materials. The company was founded in 1807 and produces books, journals, and encyclopedias, in print and electronically, as well as online products and services, training materials, and educational materials for undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education students.

==History==
The company was established in 1807 when Charles Wiley opened a print shop in Manhattan. The company was the publisher of 19th century American literary figures like James Fenimore Cooper, Washington Irving, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe, as well as of legal, religious, and other non-fiction titles. The firm took its current name in 1865. Wiley later shifted its focus to scientific, technical, and engineering subject areas, abandoning its literary interests.

Wiley&#x27;s son John (born in Flatbush, New York, October 4, 1808; died in East Orange, New Jersey, February 21, 1891) took over the business when Charles Wiley died in 1826. The firm was successively named Wiley, Lane &amp; Co., then Wiley &amp; Putnam, and then John Wiley. The company acquired its present name in 1876, when John&#x27;s second son William H. Wiley joined his brother Charles in the business.

Through the 20th century, the company expanded its publishing activities, the sciences, and higher education.

In 1960 Wiley set up a European branch in London, which later moved to Chichester.

In 1982, Wiley acquired the publishing operations of the British firm Heyden &amp; Son.

In 1989, Wiley acquired the life science publisher Liss.

In 1996, Wiley acquired the German technical publisher VCH.

In 1997, Wiley acquired the professional publisher Van Nostrand Reinhold (the successor to the company started by David Van Nostrand) from Thomson Learning.

In 1999, Wiley acquired the professional publisher Jossey-Bass from Pearson.

In 2001, Wiley acquired the publisher Hungry Minds (formerly IDG Books, including most titles formerly published by Macmillan General Reference) from International Data Group.

In 2005, Wiley acquired the British medical publisher Whurr.

Wiley marked its bicentennial in 2007. In conjunction with the anniversary, the company published &quot;Knowledge for Generations: Wiley and the Global Publishing Industry, 1807-2007&quot;, depicting Wiley&#x27;s role in the evolution of publishing against a social, cultural, and economic backdrop. Wiley has also created an online community called Wiley Living History, offering excerpts from Knowledge for Generations and a forum for visitors and Wiley employees to post their comments and anecdotes.

In 2021, Wiley acquired Hindawi and J&amp;J Editorial.

In 2023, Academic Partnerships acquired Wiley&#x27;s online education business for $150 million.

===High-growth and emerging markets===
In December 2010, Wiley opened an office in Dubai. Wiley established publishing operations in India in 2006 (though it has had a sales presence since 1966), and has established a presence in North Africa through sales contracts with academic institutions in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. On April 16, 2012, the company announced the establishment of Wiley Brasil Editora LTDA in São Paulo, Brazil, effective May 1, 2012.

===Strategic acquisition and divestiture===
Wiley&#x27;s scientific, technical, and medical business was expanded by the acquisition of Blackwell Publishing in February 2007 for , its largest purchase to that time. The combined business, named Scientific, Technical, Medical, and Scholarly (also known as Wiley-Blackwell), publishes, in print and online, 1,600 scholarly peer-reviewed journals and an extensive collection of books, reference works, databases, and laboratory manuals in the life and physical sciences, medicine and allied health, engineering, the humanities, and the social sciences.

Through a backfile initiative completed in 2007, 8.2 million pages of journal content have been made available online, a collection dating back to 1799. Wiley-Blackwell also publishes on behalf of about 700 professional and scholarly societies; among them are the American Cancer Society (ACS), for which it publishes &quot;Cancer&quot;, the flagship ACS journal; the Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing; and the American Anthropological Association. Other journals published include &quot;Angewandte Chemie&quot;, &quot;Advanced Materials&quot;, &quot;Hepatology&quot;, &quot;International Finance&quot; and &quot;Liver Transplantation&quot;.

Launched as a pilot in 1997 with fifty journals and expanded through 1998, Wiley Interscience provided online access to Wiley journals, reference works, and books, including backfile content. Journals previously from Blackwell Publishing were available online from Blackwell Synergy until they were integrated into Wiley Interscience on June 30, 2008. In December 2007, Wiley also began distributing its technical titles through the Safari Books Online e-reference service. Interscience was supplanted by Wiley Online Library in 2010.

On February 17, 2012, Wiley announced the acquisition of Inscape Holdings Inc., which provides DISC assessments and training for interpersonal business skills. A month later, Wiley announced its intention to divest assets in the areas of travel (including the Frommer&#x27;s brand), culinary, general interest, nautical, pets, and crafts, as well as the Webster&#x27;s New World and CliffsNotes brands. The planned divestiture was aligned with Wiley&#x27;s &quot;increased strategic focus on content and services for research, learning, and professional practices, and on lifelong learning through digital technology&quot;. In May 2012, the company acquired publishing company Harlan Davidson, Inc., which is a family-owned business based in Illinois. On August 13 of the same year, Wiley announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of its travel assets, including all of its interests in the Frommer&#x27;s brand, to Google Inc. On November 6, 2012, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt acquired Wiley&#x27;s cookbooks, dictionaries and study guides. In 2013, Wiley sold its pets, crafts and general interest lines to Turner Publishing Company and its nautical line to Fernhurst Books. HarperCollins acquired parts of Wiley Canada&#x27;s trade operations in 2013; the remaining Canadian trade operations were merged into Wiley U.S.

In 2021, Wiley acquired the Hindawi publishing firm for $298 million in cash to expand its open access journals portfolio.
Wiley stated it would keep the Hindawi journals under their previous brand and continue developing the open source publishing platform Phenom. In 2023 and after over 7000 article retractions in Hindawi journals related to the publication of articles originating from paper mills, Wiley announced that it will cease using the Hindawi brand and will integrate Hindawi&#x27;s 200 remaining journals into its main portfolio. The Wiley CEO who initiated the Hindawi acquisition stepped down in the wake of those announcements.

In 2021, Wiley announced the acquisition of eJournalPress (EJP), a provider of web-based technology solutions for scholarly publishing companies.

==Products==

===Brands and partnerships===
Wiley&#x27;s Professional Development brands include &quot;For Dummies&quot;, Jossey-Bass, Pfeiffer, Wrox Press, J.K. Lasser, Sybex, Fisher Investments Press, and Bloomberg Press. The STMS business is also known as Wiley-Blackwell, formed following the acquisition of Blackwell Publishing in February 2007. Brands include The Cochrane Library and more than 1,500 journals.

Wiley has publishing alliances with partners including Microsoft, CFA Institute, the Culinary Institute of America, the American Institute of Architects, the National Geographic Society, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Wiley-Blackwell also publishes journals on behalf of more than 700 professional and scholarly society partners including the New York Academy of Sciences, American Cancer Society, The Physiological Society, British Ecological Society, American Association of Anatomists, Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues and The London School of Economics and Political Science, making it the world&#x27;s largest society publisher.

Wiley partners with GreyCampus to provide professional learning solutions around big data and digital literacy. Wiley has also partnered with five other higher-education publishers to create CourseSmart, a company developed to sell college textbooks in eTextbook format on a common platform. In 2002, Wiley created a partnership with French publisher Anuman Interactive in order to launch a series of e-books adapted from the &quot;For Dummies&quot; collection. In 2013, Wiley partnered with American Graphics Institute to create an online education video and e-book subscription service called The Digital Classroom.

In 2016, Wiley launched a worldwide partnership with Christian H. Cooper to create a program for candidates taking the Financial Risk Manager exam offered by the Global Association of Risk Professionals. The program will be built on the existing Wiley efficient learning platform and Christian&#x27;s legacy Financial Risk Manager product. The partnership is built on the view the FRM designation will rapidly grow to be one of the premier financial designations for practitioners that will track the growth of the Chartered Financial Analyst designation. The program will serve tens of thousands of FRM candidates worldwide and is based on the adaptive learning technology of Wiley&#x27;s efficient learning platform and Christian&#x27;s unique writing style and legacy book series.

With the integration of digital technology and the traditional print medium, Wiley has stated that in the near future its customers will be able to search across all its content regardless of original medium and assemble a custom product in the format of choice. Web resources are also enabling new types of publisher-customer interactions within the company&#x27;s various businesses.

===Open access===
In 2016, Wiley started a collaboration with the open access publisher Hindawi to help convert nine Wiley journals to full open access. In 2018 a further announcement was made indicating that the Wiley-Hindawi collaboration would launch an additional four new fully open access journals.

On January 18, 2019, Wiley signed a contract with Project DEAL to begin open access to its academic journals for more than 700 academic institutions. It is the first contract between a publisher and a leading research nation (Germany) toward open access to scientific research.

===Higher education===
Higher Education&#x27;s &quot;WileyPLUS&quot; is an online product that combines electronic versions of texts with media resources and tools for instructors and students. It is intended to provide a single source from which instructors can manage their courses, create presentations, and assign and grade homework and tests; students can receive hints and explanations as they work on homework, and link back to relevant sections of the text.

&quot;Wiley Custom Select&quot; launched in February 2009 as a custom textbook system allowing instructors to combine content from different Wiley textbooks and lab manuals and add in their own material. The company has begun to make content from its STMS business available to instructors through the system, with content from its Professional/Trade business to follow.

In September 2019, Wiley entered into a collaboration with IIM Lucknow to offer analytics courses for finance executives.

=== Online Program Management ===
In November 2011, Wiley Education Services announced the purchase Deltak for $220 million. Wiley later acquired The Learning House in 2018. This made Wiley one of the largest OPM providers at the time, with 60 university partners and more than 700 online programs.

In June 2023, Wiley announced they would divest several business units, including Wiley University Services. Wiley&#x27;s 2023 full year revenue was $208 million, an 8% reduction from the prior year. In 2020, Wiley reported $232 million in OPM revenue with organic growth of 11% compared to prior year.

In November 2023, Academic Partnerships announced they would purchase Wiley&#x27;s OPM business for $110 million.

===Medicine===
In January 2008, Wiley launched a new version of its evidence-based medicine (EBM) product, InfoPOEMs with InfoRetriever, under the name Essential Evidence Plus, providing primary-care clinicians with point-of-care access to the most extensive source of EBM information via their PDAs/handheld devices and desktop computers. Essential Evidence Plus includes the InfoPOEMs daily EBM content alerting service and two new content resources—EBM Guidelines, a collection of practice guidelines, evidence summaries, and images, and e-Essential Evidence, a reference for general practitioners, nurses, and physician assistants providing first-contact care.

===Architecture and design===
In October 2008, Wiley launched a new online service providing continuing education units (CEU) and professional development hour (PDH) credits to architects and designers. The initial courses are adapted from Wiley books, extending their reach into the digital space. Wiley is an accredited AIA continuing education provider.

===Wiley Online Library===
Wiley Online Library is a subscription-based library of John Wiley &amp; Sons that launched on August 7, 2010, replacing Wiley Interscience. It is a collection of online resources covering life, health, and physical sciences as well as social science and the humanities. To its members, Wiley Online Library delivers access to over 4 million articles from 1,600 journals, more than 22,000 books, and hundreds of reference works, laboratory protocols, and databases from John Wiley &amp; Sons and its imprints, including Wiley-Blackwell, Wiley-VCH, and Jossey-Bass. The online library is implemented on top of the Literatum platform, developed by Atypon which Wiley acquired in 2016.

==Corporate structure==

===Governance and operations===
While the company is led by an independent management team and Board of Directors, the involvement of the Wiley family is ongoing, with sixth-generation members (and siblings) Peter Booth Wiley as the non-executive chairman of the board and Bradford Wiley II as a Director and past chairman of the board. Seventh-generation members Jesse and Nate Wiley work in the company&#x27;s Professional/Trade and Scientific, Technical, Medical, and Scholarly businesses, respectively.

Wiley has been publicly owned since 1962, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1995; its stock is traded under the symbols (for its Class A stock) and (for its class B stock).

Wiley&#x27;s operations are organized into three business divisions:
*Scientific, Technical, Medical, and Scholarly (STMS), also known as Wiley-Blackwell
*Professional Development
*Global Education

The company has approximately 10,000 employees worldwide, with headquarters in Hoboken, New Jersey, since 2002.

===Corporate culture===
In 2008, Wiley was named for the second consecutive year to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual list of the &quot;400 Best Big Companies in America&quot;. In 2007, &quot;Book Business&quot; magazine cited Wiley as &quot;One of the 20 Best Book Publishing Companies to Work For&quot;. For two consecutive years, 2006 and 2005, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine named Wiley one of the &quot;100 Best Companies to Work For&quot;. Wiley Canada was named to &quot;Canadian Business&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006 list of &quot;Best Workplaces in Canada&quot;, and Wiley Australia has received the Australian government&#x27;s &quot;Employer of Choice for Women&quot; citation every year since its inception in 2001. In 2004, Wiley was named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s &quot;Best Workplaces for Commuters&quot; list. &quot;Working Mother&quot; magazine in 2003 listed Wiley as one of the &quot;100 Best Companies for Working Mothers&quot;, and that same year, the company received the Enterprise Award from the New Jersey Business &amp; Industry Association in recognition of its contribution to the state&#x27;s economic growth. In 1998, &quot;Financial Times &quot;selected Wiley as one of the &quot;most respected companies&quot; with a &quot;strong and well thought out strategy&quot; in its global survey of CEOs.

In August 2009, the company announced a proposed reduction of Wiley-Blackwell staff in content management operations in the UK and Australia by approximately 60, in conjunction with an increase of staff in Asia. In March 2010, it announced a similar reorganization of its Wiley-Blackwell central marketing operations that would lay off approximately 40 employees. The company&#x27;s position was that the primary goal of this restructuring was to increase workflow efficiency. In June 2012, it announced the proposed closing of its Edinburgh facility in June 2013 with the intention of relocating journal content management activities currently performed there to Oxford and Asia. The move would lay off approximately 50 employees.

Wiley is a signatory of the SDG Publishers Compact, and has taken steps to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the publishing industry. These include becoming carbon neutral and supporting reforestation.
Wiley&#x27;s &quot;Natural Resources Forum&quot; was one of six out of 100 journals to receive the highest possible &quot;Five Wheel&quot; impact rating from an SDG Impact Intensity journal rating system analyzing data from 2016 to 2020.

===Gender pay gap===
Wiley reported a mean 2017 gender pay gap of 21.1% for its UK workforce, while the median was 21.5%. The gender bonus gaps are far higher, at 50.7% for the median measure and 42.3% for the mean. Wiley said: &quot;Our mean and median bonus gaps are driven by our highest earners, who are predominantly male.&quot;

==Controversies==

=== Forced inclusion of authors into AI LLM&#x27;s ===
In August 2024, it was reported that Wiley was projected to earn $44 million (£33 million) from partnerships with Artificial Intelligence (AI) firms that utilize authors&#x27; content to train Large Language Models (LLMs). Authors are not provided with an opt-out option for these deals.

===Journal protests===
In 2020, the entire editorial board of the resigned over a dispute about contract terms and the behavior of its publisher, Wiley. Wiley did not allow the editorial board members to decide over editorial appointments and decisions.

A majority of the editorial board of the journal &quot;Diversity &amp; Distributions&quot; resigned in 2018 after Wiley allegedly blocked the publication of a letter protesting the publisher&#x27;s decision to make the journal entirely open access.

===Publication practices===
According to Retraction Watch, Wiley makes some articles disappear from their journals without any explanation.

===Manipulation of bibliometrics===
According to Goodhart&#x27;s law and concerned academics like the signatories of the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment, commercial academic publishers benefit from manipulation of bibliometrics and scientometrics like the journal impact factor, which is often used as proxy of prestige and can influence revenues, including public subsidies in the form of subscriptions and free work from academics.

Five Wiley journals, which exhibited unusual levels of self-citation, had their journal impact factor of 2019 suspended from &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot; in 2020, a sanction which hit 34 journals in total.

===Publication of &quot;Paper Mill&quot; generated papers===
In April 2022, the journal &quot;Science&quot; revealed that a Ukrainian company, International Publisher Ltd., run by Ksenia Badziun, operates a Russian website where academics can purchase authorships in soon-to-be-published academic papers. Over a two-year period, researchers found that at least 419 articles &quot;appeared to match manuscripts that later appeared in dozens of different journals&quot; and that &quot;more than 100 of these identified papers were published in 68 journals run by established publishers, including Elsevier, Oxford University Press, Springer Nature, Taylor &amp; Francis, Wolters Kluwer, and Wiley-Blackwell.&quot; Wiley-Blackwell claimed that they were examining the specific papers that were identified and brought to their attention.

In 2024, Wiley closed down 19 of the about 250 journals it had acquired in the Hindawi deal, after retracting &quot;more than 11,300 &#x27;compromised&#x27; studies over the past two years&quot;; Wiley had earlier shuttered four journals for publishing fake articles coming from paper mills.

==Copyright cases==
===Hindawi case===
In 2021, Wiely purchased another Open Access company named Hindawi. Shortly after, many articles published by Hindawi were retracted and Scopus disconnected all of them from their database.

===Photographer copyrights===
A 2013 lawsuit brought by a stock photo agency for alleged violation of a 1997 license was dismissed for procedural reasons.

A 2014 ruling by the District Court for the Southern District of New York, later affirmed by the Second Circuit, says that Wiley infringed on the copyright of photographer Tom Bean by using his photos beyond the scope of the license it had purchased. The case was connected to a larger set of copyright infringement cases brought by photo agency DRK against various publishers.

A 2015 9th Circuit Court of Appeals opinion established that another photo agency had standing to sue Wiley for its usage of photos beyond the scope of the license acquired.

===Used books===
In 2018, a Southern District of New York court upheld the award of over $39 million to Wiley and other textbook publishers in a vast litigation against Book Dog Books, a re-seller of used books which was found to hold and distribute counterfeit copies. The Court found that circumstantial evidence was sufficient to establish distribution of 116 titles for which counterfeit copies had been presented and of other 5 titles. It also found that unchallenged testimony on how the publishers usually acquired licenses from authors was sufficient to establish the publishers&#x27; copyright on the books in question.

===&quot;Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons&quot;===
In 2008, John Wiley &amp; Sons filed suit against Thailand native Supap Kirtsaeng over the sale of textbooks made outside of the United States and then imported into the country. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court held 6–3 that the first-sale doctrine applied to copies of copyrighted works made and sold abroad at lower prices, reversing the Second Circuit decision which had favored Wiley.

===Internet Archive lawsuit===
In June 2020, Wiley was one of a group of publishers who sued the Internet Archive, arguing that its collection of e-books was denying authors and publishers revenue and accusing the library of &quot;willful mass copyright infringement&quot;.

== Antitrust cases ==
In September 2024, Lucina Uddin, a neuroscience professor at UCLA, sued John Wiley &amp; Sons along with five other academic journal publishers in a proposed class-action lawsuit, alleging that the publishers violated antitrust law by agreeing not to compete against each other for manuscripts and by denying scholars payment for peer review services.

<doc id="537948" wikidata="Q6531690" url="?curid=537948" title="Clean and jerk">
<text>The clean and jerk is a composite of two weightlifting movements, most often performed with a barbell: the clean and the jerk. During the &quot;clean&quot;, the lifter moves the barbell from the floor to a racked position across the deltoids, without resting fully on the clavicles. During the &quot;jerk&quot;, the lifter raises the barbell to a stationary position above the head, finishing with straight arms and legs, and the feet in the same plane as the torso and barbell.

Of the several variants of the lift, the most common is the Olympic clean and jerk, which, with the snatch, is included in Olympic weightlifting events. Clean and jerk is most commonly performed with a squat clean and a split jerk.

== Clean ==

The first part of clean and jerk is the &quot;clean&quot;, which moves the barbell from the ground to shoulder height. To execute a clean, a lifter grasps the barbell just outside the legs, typically using a hook grip. Once the barbell is above the knees, the lifter extends explosively, raising the bar as high as possible before quickly dropping into a squat and receiving it in a &quot;racked&quot; position in front of the neck and resting on the shoulders. To complete the clean, the lifter stands, often propelling the bar upward from the shoulders slightly as the erect position is attained and shifting the grip slightly wider and the feet slightly closer together in preparation for the jerk.

== Jerk ==

The &quot;jerk&quot; is a movement that lifts a barbell from the shoulder to the overhead position. It starts from the &quot;front rack&quot; position, which is the finishing position of the &quot;clean&quot;. The lift begins with the dip-drive phase – the lifter dips a few inches by bending the knees, keeping the back vertical, before driving the barbell explosively upward by straightening the legs. The lifter continues driving the barbell upward by lifting it off the shoulder with the arms, and once the barbell has passed the head, the lifter dips underneath the bar and moves the body into a stable receiving position. How the body moves into the receiving position depends on the style of jerk (split jerk, power jerk, or squat jerk) being performed, with split jerk the most common. The bar is received overhead on straight arms; once stable, the lifter recovers to a normal standing position, with the legs in the same vertical plane as the rest of the body.

== Variants ==
=== Clean ===
The &quot;clean&quot; in clean and jerk implies a squat clean. The start of squat clean is similar to a deadlift, the lifter then fully extends and shrugs to pull, moves the bar up while dropping the body under the bar, catching it between the shoulders and clavicles with the elbows up in a squat, before standing up with the bar.

The power clean refers to any variant of the clean in which the lifter does not catch the bar in a full squat position (commonly accepted as thighs parallel to the floor or below). It is used as a weight training exercise, but it is usually not performed in elite competitions.

The hang clean begins with the barbell off the ground, &quot;hanging&quot; from the arms. Both power and hang cleans are considered to be ideal for sports conditioning, as they are both total body exercises that have been known to increase neuromuscular co-ordination and core stability.

The continental clean involves lifting the bar from the floor to the final clean position by any method of the lifter&#x27;s choosing so long as the bar is not upended and does not touch the ground. The bar may be rested on the legs, stomach, or belt. Hands may be removed and replaced. The continental clean plays a special role in strongman training, where the use of an axle bar makes the additional steps of a continental clean necessary.

In split clean, the legs are split during the lift, with one leg forward and the other leg backward before moving to a standing position. It was more common in the past for clean and jerk, but it is now rare. It may be performed by those who do not have the flexibility or are too tall to perform a squat in the clean well.

=== Jerk ===

The split jerk is the most common of the three forms of jerk used in competitions, therefore the term &quot;jerk&quot; normally implies a split jerk unless an athlete prefers a different style of jerk. In split jerk, the lifter dips down their hips and propels the barbell upward by performing a short jump. The lifter then &#x27;splits&#x27; their legs and catches the bar with straight arms above their head. The split in the split jerk is not as deep as in split clean or split snatch, and moving too low in split jerk can lead to injury.

In the power jerk or push jerk, the lifter performs the same dip and jump movement, but unlike the split jerk, the lifter catches the barbell in a partial squat position. Power jerk may be used synonymously with push jerk, but a distinction may be made with push jerk being a type of power jerk where the feet stayed connected to the platform instead of being lifted.

The squat jerk is like the power jerk in how the lifter catches the barbell in a squat position, but unlike the power jerk, the lifter catches the barbell in a full squat position with the barbell locked out above their head. The squat jerk requires considerable shoulder stability and flexibility to avoid injury, and it is therefore practiced only by a small minority of lifters.

=== Single arm ===
A single arm is used instead of two. The weight lifted is usually a dumbbell or kettlebell. A barbell can also be used. The movement is broadly similar to the two armed clean and jerk, although there are various changes to the range of movement and posture. As a form of unilateral exercise, a single arm clean and jerk can be beneficial for core strength as the lifter has to work to stabilise the off-centred weight. It can also help to reduce an excessive strength imbalance which has developed between the different sides of the body. For example, in a two armed clean and jerk, there may be a muscle imbalance meaning that the right arm is performing an excessively large amount of the work and the left arm an excessively small amount. By using the single arm style and alternating between each arm, it can be ensured that each arm is performing the same amount of work.

<text>:&quot;In general mechanical terms, the word desmodromic is used to refer to mechanisms that have different controls for their actuation in different directions.&quot;
A desmodromic valve is a reciprocating engine poppet valve that is positively closed by a cam and leverage system, rather than by a more conventional spring.

The valves in a typical four-stroke engine allow the air/fuel mixture into the cylinder at the beginning of the cycle and exhaust spent gases at the end of the cycle. In a conventional four-stroke engine, valves are opened by a cam and closed by return spring. A desmodromic valve has two cams and two actuators, for positive opening and closing without a return spring.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Greek words &quot;desmos&quot; (, translated as &quot;bond&quot; or &quot;knot&quot;) and &quot;dromos&quot; (, &quot;track&quot; or &quot;way&quot;). This denotes the major characteristic of the valves being continuously &quot;bound&quot; to the camshaft.

==Idea==
The common valve spring system is satisfactory for traditional mass-produced engines that do not rev highly and are of a design that requires low maintenance. At the period of initial desmodromic development, valve springs were a major limitation on engine performance because they would break from metal fatigue. In the 1950s new vacuum melt processes helped to remove impurities from the metal in valve springs, increasing their life and efficiency greatly. However, many springs would still fail at sustained operation above 8000 RPM. The desmodromic system was devised to remedy this problem by completely removing the need for a spring. Furthermore, as maximum RPM increases, higher spring force is required to prevent valve float, leading to larger springs (with increased spring mass, and thus greater inertia), cam drag (as the valve springs require energy to compress, robbing the engine of power), and higher wear on the parts at all speeds, problems addressed by the desmodromic mechanism.

==Design and history==
Fully controlled valve movement was conceived during the earliest days of engine development, but devising a system that worked reliably and was not overly complex took a long time. Desmodromic valve systems are first mentioned in patents in 1896 by Gustav Mees. Austin&#x27;s marine engine of 1910 produced 300 bhp and was installed in a speedboat called &quot;Irene I&quot;; its all-aluminium, twin-overhead-valve engine had twin magnetos, twin carburettors and desmodromic valves. The 1914 Grand Prix Delage and Nagant (see Pomeroy &quot;Grand Prix Car&quot;) used a desmodromic valve system (quite unlike the present day Ducati system).

Azzariti, a short-lived Italian manufacturer from 1933 to 1934, produced 173 cc and 348 cc twin-cylinder engines, some of which had desmodromic valve gear, with the valve being closed by a separate camshaft.

The Mercedes-Benz W196 Formula One racing car of 1954–1955, and the Mercedes-Benz 300SLR sports racing car of 1955 both had desmodromic valve actuation.

In 1956, Fabio Taglioni, a Ducati engineer, developed a desmodromic valve system for the Ducati 125 Grand Prix, creating the Ducati 125 Desmo.

He was quoted:

The specific purpose of the desmodromic system is to force the valves to comply with the timing diagram as consistently as possible. In this way, any lost energy is negligible, the performance curves are more uniform and dependability is better.

The engineers that came after him continued that development, and Ducati held a number of patents relating to desmodromics. Desmodromic valve actuation has been applied to top-of-the-range production Ducati motorcycles since 1968, with the introduction of the &quot;widecase&quot; Mark 3 single cylinders.

In 1959 the Maserati brothers introduced one of their final designs: a desmodromic four-cylinder, 2000cc engine for their last O.S.C.A. Barchetta.

==Comparison with conventional valvetrains==
In modern engines, valve spring failure at high RPM has been mostly remedied. The main benefit of the desmodromic system is the prevention of valve float at high rpm.

In traditional spring-valve actuation, as engine speed increases, the inertia of the valve will eventually overcome the spring&#x27;s ability to close it completely before the piston reaches top dead centre (TDC). This can lead to several problems. First, the valve does not completely return to its seat before combustion begins. This allows combustion gases to escape prematurely, leading to a reduction in cylinder pressure which causes a major decrease in engine performance. This can also overheat the valve, possibly warping it and leading to catastrophic failure. Second, and most damaging, the piston collides with the valve and both are destroyed. In spring-valve engines the traditional remedy for valve float is to stiffen the springs. This increases the seat pressure of the valve (the static pressure that holds the valve closed). This is beneficial at higher engine speeds because of a reduction in the aforementioned valve float. The drawback is increased forces on all valvetrain components and increased friction and associated temperature and wear. It does not decrease power because nearly all work put into compressing the spring is later released as the spring is allowed to uncompress.

The desmodromic system avoids some of the shortcomings of spring-loaded valves because it is not subject to the high loads associated with compressing stiff springs. However, it must still overcome the inertia of the valve itself, and that depends on the mass distribution of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass for symmetric springs and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed at one end of the rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its &quot;effective mass&quot; advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another disadvantage is the difficulty in incorporating hydraulic valve lash adjusters to a desmodromic system; thus frequent valve clearance (lash) adjustments are required. Additionally, each valve requires two lash adjustments - one for the opening rocker and another for the closing rocker. However, it is rare for most high RPM engines with conventional spring-loaded valvetrains to incorporate hydraulic lash adjusters – so they too require periodic checks and adjustments of valve lash.

==Disadvantages==

Before the days when valve drive dynamics could be analyzed by computer, desmodromic drive seemed to offer solutions for problems that were worsening with increasing engine speed. Since those days, lift, velocity, acceleration, and jerk curves for cams have been modelled by computer to reveal that cam dynamics are not what they seemed. With proper analysis, problems relating to valve adjustment, hydraulic tappets, push rods, rocker arms, and above all, valve float, became things of the past without desmodromic drive.

Today most automotive engines use overhead cams, driving a flat tappet to achieve the shortest, lightest weight, and most inelastic path from cam to valve, thereby avoiding elastic elements such as pushrod and rocker arm. Computers have allowed for fairly accurate acceleration modelling of valve-train systems.

Before numerical computing methods were readily available, acceleration was only attainable by differentiating cam lift profiles twice, once for velocity and again for acceleration. This generates so much hash (noise) that the second derivative (acceleration) was uselessly inaccurate. Computers permitted integration from the jerk curve, the third derivative of lift, that is conveniently a series of contiguous straight lines whose vertices can be adjusted to give any desired lift profile.

Integration of the jerk curve produces a smooth acceleration curve while the third integral gives an essentially ideal lift curve (cam profile).
With such cams, which mostly do not look like the ones &quot;artists&quot; formerly designed, valve noise (lift-off) went away and valve train elasticity came under scrutiny.

Today, most cams have mirror image (symmetric) profiles with identical positive and negative acceleration while opening and closing valves. However, some high speed (in terms of engine RPM) motors now employ asymmetrical cam profiles in order to quickly open valves and set them back in their seats more gently to reduce wear. As well, production vehicles have employed asymmetrical cam lobe profiles since the late 1940s, as seen in the 1948 Ford V8. In this motor both the intake and exhaust profiles had an asymmetric design. More modern applications of asymmetrical camshafts include Cosworth&#x27;s 2.3 liter crate motors, which use aggressive profiles to reach upwards of 280 brake horsepower. An asymmetric cam either opens or closes the valves more slowly than it could, with the speed being limited by Hertzian contact stress between curved cam and flat tappet, thereby ensuring a more controlled acceleration of the combined mass of the reciprocating componentry (specifically the valve, tappet and spring).
In contrast, desmodromic drive uses two cams per valve, each with separate rocker arm (lever tappets). Maximum valve acceleration is limited by the cam-to-tappet galling stress, and therefore is governed by both the moving mass and the cam contact area. Maximum rigidity and minimum contact stress are best achieved with conventional flat tappets and springs whose lift and closure stress is unaffected by spring force; both occur at the base circle, where spring load is minimum and contact radius is largest. Curved (lever) tappets of desmodromic cams cause higher contact stress than flat tappets for the same lift profile, thereby limiting rate of lift and closure.

With conventional cams, stress is highest at full lift, when turning at zero speed (initiation of engine cranking), and diminishes with increasing speed as inertial force of the valve counters spring pressure, while a desmodromic cam has essentially no load at zero speed (in the absence of springs), its load being entirely inertial, and therefore increasing with speed. Its greatest inertial stress bears on its smallest radius. Acceleration forces for either method increase with the square of velocity resulting from kinetic energy.

Valve float was analyzed and found to be caused largely by resonance in valve springs that generated oscillating compression waves among coils, much like a Slinky. High speed photography showed that at specific resonant speeds, valve springs were no longer making contact at one or both ends, leaving the valve floating before crashing into the cam on closure.

For this reason, today as many as three concentric valve springs are sometimes nested inside one other; not for more force (the inner ones having no significant spring constant), but to act as snubbers to reduce oscillations in the outer spring.

An early solution to oscillating spring mass was the mousetrap or hairpin spring used on Norton Manx engines. These avoided resonance but were ungainly to locate inside cylinder heads.

Valve springs that do not resonate are progressive, wound with varying pitch or varying diameter called beehive springs from their shape. The number of active coils in these springs varies during the stroke, the more closely wound coils being on the static end, becoming inactive as the spring compresses or as in the beehive spring, where the small diameter coils at the top are stiffer. Both mechanisms reduce resonance because spring force and its moving mass vary with stroke. This advance in spring design removed valve float, the initial impetus for desmodromic valve drive.

==Examples==

Famous examples include the successful Mercedes-Benz W196 and Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR race cars and, most commonly, modern Ducati motorcycles.

Ducati motorcycles with desmodromic valves have won numerous races and championships, including Superbike World Championships from 1990 to 1992, 1994–96, 1998–99, 2001, 2003–04, 2006, 2008 and 2011. Ducati&#x27;s return to Grand Prix motorcycle racing was powered by a desmodromic V4 990 cc engine in the GP3 (Desmosedici) bike, which went on to claim several victories, including a one-two finish at the final 990 cc MotoGP race at Valencia, Spain in 2006. With the onset of the 800 cc era in 2007, they are generally still considered to be the most powerful engines in the sport, and have powered Casey Stoner to the 2007 MotoGP Championship and Ducati to the constructors championship with the GP7 (Desmosedici) bike.

<doc id="537954" wikidata="Q816581" url="?curid=537954" title="Ben Pollack">
<text>Ben Pollack (June 22, 1903 – June 7, 1971) was an American drummer and bandleader from the mid-1920s through the swing era. His eye for talent led him to employ musicians such as Benny Goodman, Jack Teagarden, Glenn Miller, Jimmy McPartland, and Harry James. This ability earned him the nickname the &quot;Father of Swing&quot;.

==Music career==

===Early years===
Pollack was born in Chicago, learned to play drums in high school and formed groups on the side, performing professionally in his teens. He joined the New Orleans Rhythm Kings in Chicago in 1923 and later joined the Los Angeles-based Harry Bastin Band. 

In 1924, he returned to Chicago, where he played for several bands, including Art Kessel&#x27;s, which ultimately led to his forming a band, the 12-piece Venice Ballroom Orchestra, there in 1925, also known as ben Pollack and his Californians, which had some performances broadcast on WLW radio in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Over time the band included Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Jack Teagarden, and Jimmy McPartland. One of the earliest members of his band was Gil Rodin, a saxophonist whose business acumen served him well later as an executive for the Music Corporation of America.

From about 1928, with involvement from Irving Mills, members of Pollack&#x27;s band moonlighted at Plaza-ARC and recorded a vast quantity of hot dance and jazz for their dime store labels — Banner, Perfect, Domino, Cameo, Lincoln, Romeo — under the names Mills&#x27; Merry Makers, Goody&#x27;s Good Timers, Kentucky Grasshoppers, Mills&#x27; Musical Clowns, The Lumberjacks, Dixie Daises, The Caroliners, The Whoopee Makers, The Hotsy Totsy Gang, Dixie Jazz Band, and Jimmy Bracken&#x27;s Toe Ticklers. Combining Pollack&#x27;s regular recordings with these side groups made Pollack&#x27;s one of the more prolific bands of the 1920s and 1930s.

Pollack&#x27;s band played in Chicago and moved to New York City in 1928, having obtained McPartland and Teagarden around that time. This outfit enjoyed immense success, playing for Broadway shows and winning an exclusive engagement at the Park Central Hotel. Pollack&#x27;s band was involved in extensive recording activity at that time, using a variety of pseudonyms in the studios. The orchestra also made a Vitaphone short subject sound film.

Pollack, in the meantime, had fancied himself as more of a bandleader-singer type instead of a drummer. To this end, he signed Ray Bauduc to handle the drumming chores. The band was booked by the Park Central Hotel in New York, during which time they became known as Ben Pollack and his Park Central Orchestra. Benny Goodman and Jimmy McPartland left the band in mid-1929. They were replaced by Matty Matlock on clarinet and Jack Teagarden&#x27;s brother, Charlie, on trumpet. Eddie Miller was also signed as a tenor saxophonist in 1930.

===Breakup and reformation===
The band broke up in 1935. Many of its members soon formed a group led by Bob Crosby, brother of Bing Crosby.

Pollack formed a new band with Harry James and Irving Fazola. With James he wrote the hit &quot;Peckin&#x27;&quot;. In the early 1940s, he organized a band led by comedian Chico Marx. He started Jewel Records, opened restaurants in Hollywood and Palm Springs, appeared as himself in the movie &quot;The Benny Goodman Story&quot;, and made a cameo in &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot;.

Pollack&#x27;s bands from the 1920s through the 1940s included Benny Goodman, Bud Freeman, Dick Cathcart, Eddie Miller, Frank Teschemacher, Freddie Slack, Glenn Miller, Charlie Spivak, Harry James, Irving Fazola, Jack Teagarden, Jimmy McPartland, Joe Marsala, Matty Matlock, Muggsy Spanier, and Yank Lawson.

==Personal life==
Pollack and Doris Robbins, who had no children, were divorced in 1957. In later years, after suffering a series of financial losses, Pollack grew despondent and hanged himself in his home in Palm Springs in 1971. He was buried in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

==Labels==
In 1926, Pollack began recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company. A 1927 newspaper ad promoted &quot;a new Victor organization – Ben Pollack and His Californians.&quot;

Pollack left Victor in late 1929 and recorded for Hit of the Week (1930), the dime store labels (Banner, Cameo, Domino, Lincoln, Perfect, Romeo) (1930–1931), Victor (1933), Columbia (1933–1934), Brunswick, Vocalion and Variety (1936–37), and Decca (1937–1938).

Most of these records are listed in discographical books (such as Brian Rust&#x27;s &quot;Jazz Records&quot;) as by Irving Mills. &quot;Jack Teagarden&#x27;s Music&quot; lists them as a &quot;Ben Pollack Unit&quot;.

==Compositions==
Pollack co-wrote the jazz standard &quot;Tin Roof Blues&quot; in 1923 when he was a member of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. The band&#x27;s trombonist George Brunies is also credited as a composer. In 1954, Jo Stafford recorded &quot;Make Love to Me&quot;, which used Pollack&#x27;s music from &quot;Tin Roof Blues&quot;. &quot;Make Love to Me&quot; was No. 1 for three weeks in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine and No. 2 in &quot;Cashbox&quot;. The song was also recorded by Anne Murray and B. B. King.

<doc id="537961" wikidata="Q263706" url="?curid=537961" title="Swift fox">
<text>The swift fox (Vulpes velox) is a small light orange-tan fox around the size of a domestic cat found in the western grasslands of North America, such as Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. It also lives in southern Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta in Canada, where it was previously extirpated. It is closely related to the kit fox (&quot;V. macrotis&quot;) and some mammalogists classify them as conspecific. However, molecular systematics imply that the two species are distinct. Interbreeding between the two species does occur where their ranges overlap (eastern New Mexico and western Texas), but this hybridization is quite restricted in scope.

The swift fox lives primarily in short-grass prairies and deserts. It became nearly extinct in the 1930s as a result of predator control programs, but was successfully reintroduced later. Currently, the conservation status of the species is considered by the IUCN as Least Concern owing to stable populations elsewhere.

Like most canids, the swift fox is an omnivore, and its diet includes grasses and fruits as well as small mammals, carrion, and insects. In the wild, its lifespan is 3 to 6 years, and it breeds once annually, from late December to March, depending on the geographic region. Pups are born anywhere from March to mid-May, and are weaned at six to seven weeks old.

==Description==

The swift fox has a dark, grayish, tan coloration that extends to a yellowish tan color across its sides and legs. The throat, chest, and belly range from pale yellow to white in color. Its tail is black-tipped, and it has black patches on its muzzle. Its ears are noticeably large, like those of the kit fox, although slightly farther apart than on the head of the latter. It is about 12 inches (30 cm) in height, and 31 inches (79 cm) long, measuring from the head to the tip of the tail, or about the size of a domestic cat. Its weight ranges from around five to seven pounds. Males and females are similar in appearance, although males are slightly larger.

==Distribution and habitat ==
The swift fox lives in short-grass prairies and western grassland. They form their dens in sandy soil on open prairies, in plowed fields, or along fences. It is native to the Great Plains region of North America, and its range extends north to the southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, and south to Texas. It reaches from western Iowa to Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming, Nebraska, and Montana.

==Conservation status==
The swift fox was once a severely endangered species, due to predator control programs in the 1930s that were aimed mostly at the gray wolf and the coyote. The species was extirpated from Canada by 1938, but a reintroduction program started in 1983 has been successful in establishing small populations in southeast Alberta and southwest Saskatchewan, despite the fact that many reintroduced individuals do not survive their first year. Nonetheless, by 1996, 540 foxes had been released around the Alberta-Saskatchewan border and Milk River Ridge areas, parts of the species&#x27; original native range. Four years later, those introduced foxes had tripled in number, making the program one of the most successful endangered species reintroduction programs in the world. In May 1999, the Species at Risk Act listed the swift fox as an &quot;endangered species&quot; in Canada, giving the species further protection for growth. A small, but stable and growing population continues to live freely in the southeastern regions of Alberta, and southwestern regions of Saskatchewan. Canada&#x27;s national recovery strategy plan was revised in 2008 by the National Swift Fox Recovery Team, with projections of a long-term goal by 2026, &quot;to restore a self-sustaining swift fox population of 1,000 or more mature, reproducing foxes that does not experience greater than a 30% population reduction in any 10-year period&quot;.

Exact population numbers of the swift fox are unknown, but it is known that they currently inhabit only 40% of their historic range. In addition to its populations in Canada, there are also swift fox populations in the United States, ranging from South Dakota to Texas. In 1995, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined that the fox warranted an endangered listing, but other higher priority species precluded its listing. This prompted state wildlife agencies within the fox&#x27;s range to create the Swift Fox Conservation Team, which worked to implement better swift fox management and monitoring programs. Populations in the United States are stable in the central part of its range, and it is not considered endangered in the United States. The IUCN Red List characterizes it as of Least Concern.

==Behavior and ecology==
In the wild, the swift fox usually lives 3–6 years, but may live up to 14 years in captivity. It is primarily nocturnal, spending only evenings and nighttime above ground in the summer. Daytime activities are usually confined to the den, but it has been known to spend the warm midday period above ground during the winter. Due to the harsh winter conditions where the swift fox can be found, there is an increase in mortality rates. The swift fox is more heavily dependent on its den than most North American canids, using them as shelter from predators. These dens are usually burrows that are two to four meters in length. It has been known to run very fast, at speeds of over . or up to The coyote is the swift fox&#x27;s main predator, but at times chooses not to consume the swift fox, killing it more often as competition than as prey. Other predators include the American badger, golden eagle, and bobcat. It is also vulnerable to trapping and poisoning, as well as death on highways.

===Reproduction===
Swift foxes are a socially monogamous species, although multiple breeding strategies have been observed. The adult swift fox&#x27;s breeding season varies with region. In the southern United States, it mates between December and February with pups born in March and early April, while in Canada, the breeding season begins in March, and pups are born in mid-May. The male swift fox matures and may mate at one year, while the female usually waits until her second year before breeding. Adults live in pairs, and although some individuals mate for life, others choose different partners each year. Gestation takes around 51 days, and four to five kits are born.

The swift fox only has one litter annually, but may occupy up to thirteen dens in one year, moving because prey is scarce or because skin parasites build up inside the den. Sometimes it makes other burrows from other bigger animals, even though it is completely capable of digging one on its own. Pups are born in the den and typically remain there for approximately one month. A newborn pup&#x27;s eyes and ears remain closed for ten to fifteen days, leaving it dependent on the mother for food and protection during this time. It is usually weaned around six or seven weeks old and remains with its parents until fall. Recent research has shown that social organization in the swift fox is unusual among canids, since it is based on the females. Females maintain territories at all times, but males emigrate if the resident female is killed or removed.

===Diet===
Like most foxes, the swift fox is an omnivore. Rabbits, mice, ground squirrels, birds, insects, other arthropods, lizards, amphibians, fish and eggs are staples. Grasses and fruits round out its diet. However, like any efficient forager, the swift fox takes advantage of seasonal foods. During the summer, adults eat large amounts of insects, including beetles and grasshoppers, and feed their young with larger prey items. Deer and other carrion killed by other animals may also be important food sources.

<doc id="537968" wikidata="Q256380" url="?curid=537968" title="Carly Fiorina">
<text>Cara Carleton &quot;Carly&quot; Fiorina (; ; born September 6, 1954) is an American businesswoman and politician, known primarily for her tenure as chief executive officer (CEO) of Hewlett-Packard (HP) from 1999 to 2005. Fiorina was the first woman to lead a &quot;Fortune&quot; Top-20 company.

Fiorina started her career at AT&amp;T and subsequently worked at Lucent Technologies, where she led the joint venture with Philips.

In 2002, Fiorina oversaw what was then the largest technology sector merger in history, in which HP acquired rival personal computer manufacturer, Compaq. The transaction made HP the world&#x27;s largest seller of personal computers. HP subsequently laid off 30,000 U.S. employees. Nonetheless, the number of employees exceeded the pre-merger figure and grew to 150,000 during her tenure. In February 2005, she was forced to resign as CEO and chair following a boardroom disagreement. She subsequently served as Chair of the philanthropic organization Good360.

Fiorina was an adviser to Republican senator John McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. In 2010, she won the Republican nomination for the United States Senate in California, but lost the general election to incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. Fiorina was a candidate in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, and was for seven days the vice-presidential running mate of Ted Cruz until he suspended his campaign. In 2020, Fiorina endorsed the presidential campaign of Democrat Joe Biden.

==Early life and education==
Cara Carleton Sneed was born on September 6, 1954, in Austin, Texas, the daughter of Madelon Montross (née Juergens) and Joseph Tyree Sneed III. The name &quot;Carleton&quot;, from which &quot;Carly&quot; is derived, has been used in every generation of the Sneed family since the Civil War. At the time of her birth, Fiorina&#x27;s father was a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. He would later become dean of Duke University School of Law, Deputy U.S. Attorney General, and judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Her mother was an abstract painter. She is mainly of English and German ancestry, and was raised Episcopalian. Her paternal great-great-great-grandfather, Joseph P. Sneed, was a Methodist minister and educator in Texas. Her paternal great-great-great-great-uncle built the Constantine Sneed House in Brentwood, Tennessee, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Carly was a Brownie but did not become a Girl Scout due to her family&#x27;s frequent moves. She attended Channing School, in London. She later attended five different high schools, including one in Ghana, graduating from Charles E. Jordan High School in Durham, North Carolina. At one time she aspired to be a classical pianist. She received a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy and medieval history at Stanford University, in 1976. During her summers, she worked as a secretary for Kelly Services. She attended the UCLA School of Law in 1976, but dropped out after one semester. She worked as a receptionist for six months at a real estate firm, Marcus &amp; Millichap, moving up to a broker position. When she married in 1977, she and her husband moved to Bologna, Italy, where he was doing graduate work; there she did English tutoring to Italian businessmen.

In 1980, Fiorina received a Master of Business Administration, in marketing, from the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, College Park. In 1989 she obtained a Master of Science degree in management from the MIT Sloan School of Management, under the Sloan Fellows program.

==Business career==

===AT&amp;T and Lucent===

In 1980, Fiorina joined AT&amp;T as a management trainee, selling telephone services to big federal agencies. In 1990, she became the company&#x27;s first female officer as senior vice president overseeing the company&#x27;s hardware and systems division, eventually heading its North American operations.

In 1995, Fiorina led corporate operations for Lucent Technologies, Inc., a spin-off from AT&amp;T of its Western Electric and Bell Labs divisions into a new company. In that capacity, she reported to Lucent chief executive Henry B. Schacht. She played a key role in planning and implementing the 1996 initial public offering of a successful stock and company launch strategy. The spin-off became one of the most successful IPOs in U.S. history, raising 3 billion.

Later in 1996, Fiorina was appointed president of Lucent&#x27;s consumer products sector. In 1997, she was named group president for Lucent&#x27;s 19 billion global service-provider business, overseeing marketing and sales for the company&#x27;s largest customer segment. That year, Fiorina chaired a 2.5 billion joint venture between Lucent&#x27;s consumer communications and Royal Philips Electronics, under the name Philips Consumer Communications (PCC). In the edition of October 12, 1998, of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, Fiorina was named &quot;The Most Powerful Woman in American Business&quot;.

Lucent added 22,000 jobs and revenues grew from US$19 billion to US$38 billion and the company&#x27;s market share increased in every region for every product. According to Fortune magazine, Lucent increased sales by lending money to their own customers, writing that &quot;In a neat bit of accounting magic, money from the loans began to appear on Lucent&#x27;s income statement as new revenue while the dicey debt got stashed on its balance sheet as an allegedly solid asset&quot;. Lucent&#x27;s stock price grew 10-fold.

===Hewlett-Packard (HP)===

====Hiring====

In July 1999, Hewlett-Packard Company named Fiorina chief executive officer, succeeding Lewis Platt and prevailing over the internal candidate Ann Livermore. Matthew Boyle of &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine said of Fiorina&#x27;s hiring as HP&#x27;s first woman CEO that, &quot;Carly Fiorina didn&#x27;t just break the glass ceiling, she obliterated it, as the first woman to lead a FORTUNE 20 company.&quot;

Writing in &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in August 2015, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld described the hiring as the result of &quot;a dysfunctional HP board committee, filled with its own poisoned politics, hired her with no CEO experience, nor interviews with the full board.&quot; Fiorina received a larger signing offer than any of her predecessors, including: 65 million in restricted stock to compensate her for the Lucent stock and options she left behind, a 3 million signing bonus, a 1 million annual salary (plus a 1.25–3.75 million annual bonus), 36,000 in mortgage assistance, a relocation allowance, and permission (and encouragement) to use company planes for personal affairs. Fortune also named her the most powerful woman in America for five consecutive years.

====Separating Agilent Technologies from HP and proposed PWC acquisition====
Although the decision to spin off the company&#x27;s analytical instruments division pre-dated her arrival, one of her first major responsibilities as chief executive was overseeing the separation of the unit into the stand-alone Agilent Technologies. Fiorina proposed the acquisition of the technology services arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers for almost 14 billion, but withdrew the bid after a lackluster reception from Wall Street. Following the collapse of the dot-com bubble, the PwC consulting arm was acquired by IBM for less than 4 billion. HP later acquired Electronic Data Systems, another technology services company, which some considered a validation of Fiorina&#x27;s strategy.

====Compaq merger====
In early September 2001, in the wake of the bursting of the Tech Bubble, Fiorina announced the acquisition of PC maker Compaq with 25 billion in stock, which, at the time, was the second largest producer of personal computers, after Dell. HP stock traded down by 30% on the news of the merger. The Compaq merger created the world&#x27;s largest personal computer manufacturer in terms of units shipped.

Fiorina was frequently at odds with HP&#x27;s board of directors, and she had to fight with the board for the merger. Walter Hewlett (the son of company co-founder William Hewlett) was a source of particularly strong opposition. Hewlett originally voted with the other board members to approve the Compaq deal, but he later changed his mind. He launched a proxy fight against Fiorina&#x27;s efforts which Fiorina won with a &quot;razor-thin margin&quot; of 51.4% of the shareholders, with the institutional shareholders providing the bulk of the support. Fiorina was supported in the proxy battle by other board members, including Richard Hackborn, Philip M. Condit, George A. Keyworth, II, and Robert Knowling. Fiorina proceeded to reorganize HP and merge the parts of it that she kept with Compaq.

The merger was met initially with almost universal skepticism. The February 7, 2005, issue of &quot;Fortune&quot; described her merger plan as &quot;failing&quot; and the prognosis as &quot;doubtful&quot;. Business professor Robert Burgelman and former HP executive vice president, Webb McKinney, who led HP&#x27;s post-merger integration team, analyzed the merger and concluded that it was ultimately successful. In 2008, former acting CEO of Compaq Ben Rosen stated that although Fiorina lacked the skills to run the merged company, her successors made it work. HP was able to integrate Compaq&#x27;s operations and emerge as the world&#x27;s largest seller of personal computers. The industry soon fell into decline, leading to further difficulties for the company. HP eventually wrote off 1.2 billion from the acquisition as the personal computer market declined. Looking back, a 2011 &quot;The New York Times&quot; article described it as &quot;one of the more questionable deals of the time.&quot;

====Allegations of sales to Iran despite sanctions====

In 1997, prior to Fiorina&#x27;s joining the company, HP&#x27;s Dutch subsidiary formed a partnership with a company in Dubai, Redington Gulf, which sold HP&#x27;s products in Iran. Under Fiorina&#x27;s leadership at HP, the company sold millions of dollars worth of printers and computer products to Iran through the foreign subsidiary, while U.S. export sanctions were in effect. After the story was initially reported by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 2008, the SEC sent a letter of inquiry to HP, who responded that products worth 120 million were sold in fiscal 2008 arguing that the sales did not violate export sanctions because they were made through a foreign subsidiary. According to former officials who worked on sanctions, HP was using a loophole by routing their sales through a foreign subsidiary. HP ended its relationship with Redington Gulf after the SEC inquiry.

====Providing HP servers to the NSA====
In a September 2015 interview with Michael Isikoff, Fiorina said that, in the weeks following the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, she received a phone call from Michael Hayden, then the director of the National Security Agency, asking her assistance in providing HP computer servers to the NSA for expanded surveillance. Hayden confirmed that he had made the request for HP servers as part of Stellar Wind, a 2001–2007 NSA warrantless surveillance program, but the details were not revealed to Fiorina at the time. Fiorina &quot;acknowledged she complied with Hayden&#x27;s request, redirecting trucks of HP computer servers that were on their way to retail stores from a warehouse in Tennessee to the Washington Beltway, where they were escorted by NSA security&quot; to the agency&#x27;s Fort Meade headquarters. In 2015, Fiorina said: &quot;I felt it was my duty to help, and so we did,&quot; adding, &quot;They were ramping up a whole set of programs and needed a lot of data crunching capability to try and monitor a whole set of threats. ... What I knew at the time was our nation had been attacked.&quot; Hayden also requested that Fiorina provide advice to the agency &quot;on how the CIA could maintain its undercover espionage mission in a culture of increasing government leaks and demands for greater public accountability and openness.&quot; According to Fiorina, she advised the agency to be &quot;as transparent as possible, about as much as possible&quot;.

====Changes to HP culture====
Fiorina&#x27;s predecessor at HP had pushed for an outsider to replace him because he believed that the company had become complacent and that consensus-driven decision making was inhibiting the company&#x27;s growth. Fiorina instituted three major changes shortly after her arrival: replacing profit sharing with bonuses awarded if the company met financial expectations, a reduction in operating units from 83 to 12, and consolidating back-office functions.

Fiorina faced a backlash among HP employees and the tech community for her leading role in the demise of HP&#x27;s egalitarian &quot;The HP Way&quot; work culture and guiding philosophy, which she felt hindered innovation. Because of changes to HP&#x27;s culture, and requests for voluntary pay cuts to prevent layoffs (subsequently followed by the largest layoffs in HP&#x27;s history), employee satisfaction surveys at HPpreviously among the highest in Americarevealed &quot;widespread unhappiness&quot; and distrust, and Fiorina was sometimes booed at company meetings and attacked on HP&#x27;s electronic bulletin board.

According to &quot;The Fiscal Times&quot;, Fiorina and others have argued that she &quot;laid the groundwork for some of HP&#x27;s progress under her successors&quot;, and that she shook the culture at HP so that it could compete in the Internet Age.

====iPod+HP====

In January 2004, Fiorina announced an agreement with Apple founder Steve Jobs for the iPod+HPa co-branded iPod sold through HP&#x27;s retail channels. As part of the agreement, HP was forbidden from selling a competitor to the iPod until August 2006 and HP agreed to pre-install iTunes on every computer sold. Two days before Fiorina announced the HP+iPod, Jobs announced a new product, the iPod mini, catching Fiorina off guard. HP did not sell the newer versions of the iPod in a timely fashion, leaving them to sell an outdated device for several months. In addition, Apple began selling its own iPods through the same retail channels. As a result, at the peak of the program, iPod+HP sales represented only a small portion of total iPod sales. In July 2005, soon after Fiorina resigned as CEO, her successor Mark Hurd ended HP&#x27;s agreement with Apple, within days of taking office, a &quot;highly symbolic decision&quot; that was well-received as a return to innovation by HP.

Steven Levy, writing in 2015 on the agreement, wrote that &quot;Steve Jobs blithely mugged her and HP&#x27;s shareholders. By getting Fiorina to adopt the iPod as HP&#x27;s music player, Jobs had effectively gotten his [iTunes] software installed on millions of computers for free, stifled his main competitor, and gotten a company that prided itself on invention to declare that Apple was a superior inventor. And he lost nothing ...&quot;

====Layoffs====
In January 2001, HP laid off 1,700 marketing employees. In June 2001, Fiorina asked employees to either take pay cuts or use their allotted vacation time to cut additional costs, resulting in more than 80,000 people signing up and saving HP 130 million. Despite these efforts from employees, in July Fiorina announced that 6,000 jobs would be cut, the biggest reduction in the company&#x27;s 64-year history, but those cuts would not actually occur until after the Compaq merger was announced. In September 2001, Fiorina said she intended to cut an additional 15,000 jobs in the event of a merger with Compaq.

In all, Fiorina laid off 30,000 U.S. employees. According to &quot;PolitiFact&quot;, those 30,000 layoffs were &quot;as a result of the merger with Compaq...&quot; By 2004 the number of HP employees was about the same as the pre-merger total of HP and Compaq combined, and that 2004 number included roughly 8,000 employees of other companies acquired by HP since 2001. Altogether, under Fiorina&#x27;s leadership, HP had a net gain of employees, including employees from mergers as well as hires in countries outside the United States.

In 1999, when Fiorina became CEO of HP, the company had 84,800 employees. After the merger with Compaq, the company had a total of 145,000 employees worldwide. At the time of her resignation in 2005, after HP had acquired several other companies, HP had about 150,000 employees.

====Forced resignation====
HP&#x27;s revenue doubled and the rate of patent filings increased due to mergers with Compaq and other companies during Fiorina&#x27;s stint as CEO. In addition, HP&#x27;s cash flow increased by 40%, to around $6.8 billion. However, the company underperformed by a number of other metrics: there were no gains in HP&#x27;s net income despite a 70% gain in net income of the S&amp;P 500 over this period; the company&#x27;s debt rose from 4.25 billion to 6.75 billion; and its stock price fell by 50%, exceeding declines in the S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Sector index and the NASDAQ. By contrast, stock prices for IBM and Dell fell by 27.5% and 3% respectively during this time. The Compaq acquisition was not as transformative as Fiorina and the board had envisioned: in the merger proxy, they had forecasted that the PC division of the merged entities would generate an operating margin of 3.0% in 2003, while the actual figure was 0.1% in that year and 0.9% in 2004.

In 2004, HP fell dramatically short of its predicted third-quarter earnings, and Fiorina fired three executives during a 5 AM telephone call. In early January 2005, the Hewlett-Packard board of directors discussed with Fiorina a list of issues that the board had regarding the company&#x27;s performance and disappointing earning reports. The board proposed a plan to shift her authority to HP division heads, which Fiorina resisted strongly. A week after the meeting, the confidential plan was leaked to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. According to &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;&#x27;s Ben Elgin, directors were also concerned about the board&#x27;s inability to work effectively with Fiorina.

Less than a month later, the board brought back Tom Perkins and forced Fiorina to resign as chair and chief executive officer of the company. The company&#x27;s stock jumped 6.9 percent on news of her departure, adding almost three billion dollars to the value of HP in a single day.

In her book &quot;Tough Choices&quot;, she referred to board members&#x27; behavior as &quot;amateurish and immature&quot;. Larry Sonsini, who investigated the leak related to Fiorina&#x27;s forced resignation, described the board in his report to Fiorina as being &quot;dysfunctional.&quot;

On May 13, 2008, HP, under then-Chief Executive Mark Hurd, confirmed that it had reached a deal to buy Electronic Data Systems, the largest since the Compaq purchase. The price was a reported $12.6 billion. At the time of the announcement, Loren Steffy of &quot;The Houston Chronicle&quot; suggested that the EDS acquisition after Fiorina&#x27;s tenure was evidence that her failed plan to acquire part of Pricewaterhouse Coopers was justified.

Under the company&#x27;s agreement with Fiorina, which was characterized as a golden parachute by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and Yahoo! Finance, Fiorina received a severance package valued at 21 million, which consisted of 2.5 times her annual salary plus bonus and the balance from accelerated vesting of stock options.
According to &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, Fiorina collected over 100 million in compensation during her short tenure at HP.

===Business leadership image===
In 2003, Fiorina was named by &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; the most powerful woman in business, a position she held for five years. In 2004, she was included in the &quot;Time&quot; 100 ranking of &quot;most influential people in the world today&quot; and named tenth on the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of The World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women. In 2005, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described Fiorina as the epitome of &quot;an alluring, controversial new breed of chief executive officers who combine grand visions with charismatic but self-centered and demanding styles&quot;. The same year, Wharton School professor Michael Useem opined, &quot;Fiorina scored high on leadership style, but she failed to execute strategy&quot;.

Following her forced resignation from HP, several commentators ranked Fiorina as one of the worst American (or tech) CEOs of all time. In 2008, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; grouped her with a list of products and ideas that flopped, declaring that her tenure as CEO of HP was the sixth worst tech flop of all time, and characterizing her as the &quot;anti-Steve Jobs&quot; for reversing the goodwill of &quot;geeks&quot; and alienating existing customers. During Fiorina&#x27;s tenure as CEO, HP leased or purchased five planes, including two Gulfstream IVs, to replace four aging aircraft, only one of which had the range to fly overseas. One Gulfstream IV, acquired at a cost of 30 million and available for Fiorina&#x27;s &quot;exclusive&quot; use, became a rallying point among HP employees who complained of Fiorina&#x27;s expensive self-promotion and top-down managerial style during a time of company layoffs. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of Yale School of Management said in August 2015 that problems with Fiorina&#x27;s leadership style were what caused HP to lose half its value during her tenure.

Others have defended her business leadership decisions and viewed the Compaq merger as successful over the long term.

==Transition of career and public persona==

===Autobiography===
In October 2006, Fiorina published an autobiography entitled &quot;Tough Choices&quot;, about her career and her views on issues, what constitutes a leader, how women can thrive in business, and the role technology will continue to play in reshaping the world. A review by NPR Books noted that &quot;The book covers Fiorina&#x27;s rise and fall as America&#x27;s most powerful female executive.&quot;

Earlier books by others about Fiorina&#x27;s role in the merger at HP included: &quot;Backfire,&quot; (2003) by Peter Burrows, and &quot;Perfect Enough: Carly Fiorina and the Reinvention of Hewlett-Packard,&quot; (2003), by George Anders. A 2003 review by &quot;The New York Times&quot; of these books said, &quot;Two new books about the deal and its main championHewlett-Packard&#x27;s chair and chief executive officer, Carly Fiorinashow that there is much investors can glean immediately from this merger.&quot;

===Other organizational involvement===
In October 2007, Fiorina signed with the Fox Business Network as a business commentator.

After resigning from HP, Fiorina served on the board of Revolution Health Group and computer security company Cybertrust in 2005. In 2006, she became a member of the board of directors for chip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), but resigned from that board on November 30, 2009, with the company saying this was &quot;because she planned to devote her full time and energy&quot; to her Senate campaign. She had attended 17% of the TSMC directors&#x27; meetings in 2009 and 20% of TSMC directors&#x27; meetings in 2008. She served as a member of the MIT Corporation from 2004 to 2012. She was a member of the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 2005. She is an honorary fellow of the London Business School. In July 2012, Governor Bob McDonnell of Virginia appointed her to the James Madison University Board of Visitors. In 2015, Fiorina received an honorary degree and delivered the commencement address at Southern New Hampshire University.

Fiorina is the chair and CEO of Carly Fiorina Enterprises, a business and charitable foundation. A spokesperson described Fiorina Enterprises as &quot;...a nonprofit enterprise that helped Fiorina structure speaking engagements and appearances while providing the public with information about her activities...&quot; The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that, as of July 2009, she had &quot;never registered her Carly Fiorina Enterprises to conduct business in California, either with the California secretary of state or the clerk of Santa Clara County, where Fiorina lives.&quot;

==Nonprofit work==

===Good360===
In April 2012, Fiorina became chair of Good360, a 501(c)(3) nonpartisan nonprofit organization in Alexandria, Virginia, which helps companies donate excess merchandise to charities. Good360 has been consistently ranked by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as one of the top 10 most efficient charities, and ranked as the 33rd largest charity in the United States. Good360 is &quot;the largest product donation marketplace in the world. We help companies take excess inventory and then distribute that excess inventory to 37,000 vetted charities around this country.&quot;

In September 2014, Fiorina led an effort by Good360 to get American corporations &quot;to help combat the Ebola virus in West Africa – by donating specific items.&quot; She left the organization when she declared her presidential candidacy in 2015.

===One Woman Initiative===

Fiorina served as Fund Chair of One Woman Initiative (OWI), a partnership between the private sector and government agencies, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the United States Department of State (DoS). OWI describes itself as &quot;An International Women&#x27;s Empowerment Fund&quot; that seeks to &quot;support existing initiatives in Muslim majority countries and countries with large Muslim populations&quot; and &quot;focus on key empowerment issues including entrepreneurship, political leadership, and the rule of law.&quot; OWI said it would raise funds in order to give grants to achieve these objectives, with contributions managed through a separate section 501(c)(3) designated organization.

In June 2009, USAID announced that OWI grants totaling over 500,000 had been made to grassroots organizations in Azerbaijan, Egypt, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines.

===Opportunity International===

On February 14, 2013, Opportunity International announced a partnership with Fiorina and OWI to provide financial resources, education and training to two million women living in poverty. Fiorina was referred to as Global Ambassador to Opportunity International. On May 4, 2015, Opportunity International announced that Fiorina was resigning from the Board after the announcement of her presidential candidacy.

===Fiorina Foundation===
Fiorina is the chair and CEO of the Fiorina Foundation, a charity that has donated to causes including Care-a-Van for Kids, a transportation program to aid seriously ill children, and the African Leadership Academy, an educational institution in South Africa. The foundation &#x27;enables corporations, spokeswomen entrepreneurs and philanthropists alike to address some of the world&#x27;s most challenging issues,&#x27; according to Fiorina&#x27;s Web site, carlyfiorina.com.&quot;

The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that &quot;Records also show that her Fiorina Foundation has never registered with the Internal Revenue Service or the state attorney general&#x27;s charitable trust division, which tax-exempt charities are required to do. A spokeswoman commented that &quot;Fiorina and her staff believed the foundation was not required to file with the IRS because it accepted no outside contributions and donated only her personal wealth to worthy causes.&quot;

===Colonial Williamsburg Foundation===
In 2017, Fiorina joined the board of trustees for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. In December 2020, she was elected the chair of the board of trustees.

==Political career==
Fiorina has never held public office, but said that her status as an outsider is a positive attribute, given that in her opinion, professional politicians have failed to deliver to the American people, stating in an interview with Fox News in 2015 that &quot;82% of the American people now think we need people from outside the professional political class to serve in public office.&quot;

===Republican National Committee fundraising chair and 2008 campaign===
In 2006, Fiorina worked as an advisor for Republican senator John McCain&#x27;s presidential campaign. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that while she did not want to run, she was an executive who could possibly become a candidate for president. On March 7, 2008, Fiorina was named fundraising chair for the Republican National Committee&#x27;s &quot;Victory&quot; initiative. She was reportedly a &quot;point person&quot; for the McCain campaign on issues related to business and economic affairs. Fiorina&#x27;s severance package from Hewlett-Packard in 2005 was viewed by some as a political liability during the campaign. Referring to the McCain campaign, &quot;Newsweek&quot; described Fiorina as &quot;the most prominent surrogate on economics issues in any of the major campaigns.&quot;

Earlier that day, she defended the selection of Sarah Palin as McCain&#x27;s running mate and said that Palin was being subjected to sexist attacks, a charge she repeated a few days later in response to one of the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parodies of Sarah Palin.

When asked during a radio interview on September 15, 2008, whether she thought Palin had the experience to run a major company like Hewlett-Packard, Fiorina answered &quot;No, I don&#x27;t. But that&#x27;s not what she&#x27;s running for. Running a corporation is a different set of things.&quot; When questioned about her answer, she answered, &quot;I don&#x27;t think John McCain could run a major corporation.&quot; Fiorina further said that none of the candidates on either ticket had the experience to run a major corporation. After media coverage of Fiorina&#x27;s comments, she &quot;disappeared from public view&quot; and planned television appearances were cancelled, although she continued to chair the party&#x27;s fundraising committee. Responding to Barack Obama&#x27;s victory over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary, Fiorina sought to attract more women to the Republican camp by praising Clinton&#x27;s effort.

==== Vice presidential campaign speculation ====
In early 2008, she was referred to in media sources as a potential vice presidential candidate, In discussing the possibility of Fiorina becoming McCain&#x27;s running mate, political analyst Stuart Rothenberg pointed out her potential downside, stating that she &quot;is rather easy to sketch out&quot; because she would &quot;become a talking point for Democrats&quot; who would focus on Fiorina&#x27;s generous severance package from when she had left HP and her management style. Rothenberg concluded that Fiorina was &quot;like a dream come true&quot; for Democratic opposition researchers.

===Defense Business Board and Central Intelligence Agency===
Fiorina performed unpaid service on the Defense Business Board, which looked at staffing issues, among others, at The Pentagon.

Fiorina spent two years leading the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s External Advisory Board, from 2007 to 2009, and became chair of that board, when the board was first created in 2007 by then-CIA director Michael Hayden during the George W. Bush administration.

===2010 U.S. Senate candidacy for California===
On November 4, 2009, Fiorina formally announced her candidacy in the 2010 Senate election in a bid to unseat incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer. Fiorina&#x27;s campaign in the Republican primary for that seat received a number of endorsements, including one from Sarah Palin in the form of a Facebook note. Her campaign ad about Republican rival Tom Campbell featuring a &quot;Demon Sheep&quot;created by Fiorina advertising consultant Fred Davis IIIgenerated largely negative international publicity. After the ad went viral, the California Democratic Party created a parody of the ad depicting Fiorina herself as a demon sheep.

On June 8, 2010, Fiorina won the Republican primary election for the Senate with over 50 percent of the vote, beating Campbell and state assemblyman Chuck DeVore.

A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; search of public records indicated Fiorina had failed to vote in most elections. Fiorina responded: &quot;I&#x27;m a lifelong registered Republican but I haven&#x27;t always voted, and I will provide no excuse for it. You know, people die for the right to vote. And there are many, many Californians and Americans who exercise that civic duty on a regular basis. I didn&#x27;t. Shame on me.&quot;

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that Fiorina had conservative positions on certain social issues. She personally opposed abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment of the mother&#x27;s life. As a private citizen, she stated that she voted for Proposition 8, which defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Following an August 4, 2010, federal court ruling that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, Fiorina expressed disagreement with the ruling, saying that California voters spoke clearly against same-sex unions when a majority approved the proposition in 2008. She stated that she opposed litmus tests for Supreme Court nominations and did not favor a federal &quot;personhood&quot; amendment. Fiorina had called global warming a &quot;serious issue&quot; but said that the science surrounding it is inconclusive, saying &quot;I think we should have the courage to examine the science on an ongoing basis.&quot; In a campaign ad, Fiorina likened Boxer&#x27;s concerns over global warming to worrying about &quot;the weather.&quot; Fiorina accepted contributions from the coal industry as well as Koch Industries. Fiorina opposed the cap-and-trade legislation supported by Boxer, and thought efforts to control greenhouse gases would cost 3 million jobs and are &quot;massively destructive&quot;.

In financial disclosures, Fiorina identified her net worth at between 30 million and 120 million, and by October 22, Fiorina had contributed a total of 6.5 million to her own race.

Sarah Palin was set to appear at a GOP fundraiser two weeks ahead of the November 2 election, but neither Meg Whitman (the Republican nominee for Governor of California) nor Fiorina – both big-name Republicans – planned to attend. The prediction was that Palin&#x27;s primary endorsement would jeopardize her general election candidacy.

Boxer won the general election, defeating Fiorina 52.2% to 42.2%.

===&quot;Unlocking Potential Project&quot; PAC===
Fiorina launched and developed a political action committee (PAC) known as &quot;Up-Project&quot; (short for &quot;Unlocking Potential Project&quot;) from 2011 to 2014. The stated mission of the organization was &quot;...to engage women with new messages and new messengers by focusing on personal interactions with voters and going beyond the traditional methods of identifying, persuading and turning-out voters...&quot; In November 2014, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;Helping Fiorina chart her political future are consultants Frank Sadler, who once worked for Koch Industries, and Stephen DeMaura, a strategist who heads Americans for Job Security, a pro-business advocacy group in Virginia&quot;; The Up-Project website lists Fiorina as chair.

===American Conservative Union Foundation and CPAC===

On October 1, 2013, Al Cardenas, chair of the American Conservative Union (ACU), appointed Fiorina as chair of the American Conservative Union Foundation (ACUF), the ACU&#x27;s educational arm. The ACU is a conservative 501(c)(4) organization, while the ACUF is its affiliated 501(c)(3) foundation, which organizes the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).

Fiorina was co-chair of CPAC 2014, making a speech at the conference. At CPAC 2015, Fiorina again made a speech at the conference. It was speculated that Fiorina would announce her candidacy for the Republican nomination for president in that speech, but Fiorina did not, instead making her official announcement months later, on May 4, 2015, in a television and promotional video, therein repeating her talking points from CPAC and including an attack on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

Fiorina resigned as ACU Foundation chair in early 2015.

===U.S. presidential campaign, 2016===
Fiorina ruled out running for the U.S. Senate in 2016, but refused to rule out running for president in 2016 or Governor of California in 2018. In November 2014, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Fiorina was &quot;actively exploring&quot; a run for president. Her business background and status as the only CEO and the only woman in a &quot;sea of suited men&quot; were mentioned as positives, though Republican strategists pointed to her poor 2010 Senate performance, unpaid campaign debt, and dismissal from HP as &quot;considerable challenges&quot; to her prospects. In March 2015, Fiorina said on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; that there was a &quot;higher than 90% chance&quot; that she would run for president in 2016.

On May 4, 2015, Fiorina announced her candidacy during an interview on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, with George Stephanopoulos. Fiorina entered the race with immediate criticism of Hillary Clinton. It was reported that the GOP saw Fiorina as &quot;the tip of the spear&quot; in its attack of the Clinton campaign because she was uniquely positioned to isolate her criticisms of Clinton from claims of gender bias.

Shortly after Fiorina announced her entry into the 2016 presidential race, in a replay of her 2010 senatorial race, the social media and editorial outlets questioned her tenure as HP&#x27;s CEO as a basis for her run for president, focusing around US job cuts and offshoring that Fiorina directed during her tenure at HP, and contrasting it with the high compensation bonuses she received from the company. Campaign Manager, Sarah Isgur Flores, deflected the job cut criticism saying, Fiorina &quot;worked hard to save as many jobs as possible.&quot;

On August 6, Fiorina participated in Fox News&#x27;s first GOP debate. Failing to qualify for one of the Fox News prime-time debate slots, she was relegated to the debate airing earlier the same day. Fiorina&#x27;s performance led news sources to conclude she had won the early debate. Following the debate, several pundits correctly predicted that her polling numbers would surge. On August 9, Fiorina reported an uptick in fundraising support. In an online poll by NBC and SurveyMonkey on August 10, Fiorina came in fourth of the seventeen Republican contenders with 8% of the sampled Republican primary voters saying they would support her in a primary or a caucus, a gain in support of six points from previous polling data. At another debate in September, hosted by CNN, Fiorina misrepresented a Planned Parenthood sting video, describing a grisly scene which was not in the video. She was sharply criticized for this in the media; the gaffe consumed much of the post-debate coverage. Planned Parenthood responded that she had lied, saying it was &quot;not the first time Carly Fiorina has lied.&quot; PolitiFact chief editor Angie Drobnic Holan mentioned this particular lie in a December 2015 comparison of the presidential candidates with regard to their truthfulness. In the comparison, Fiorina scored 50% falsehood, the sixth worst performance.

&quot;The National Review&quot; pointed out her role as foil to Hillary Clinton, saying &quot;Carly Fiorina is no doubt getting attention because of her unique background, but more and more people are staying to listen because she has something fresh to say&quot;, and that &quot;Fiorina also seems to relish the role of being the most pointed critic of Hillary Clinton... She contrasts her background as a &#x27;problem solver&#x27; with Clinton&#x27;s record as a professional politician.&quot; &quot;The Nation&quot; commented, &quot;With so-called women&#x27;s issues poised to play an unprecedented role in the upcoming election, Republicans need someone who can troll Hillary Clinton without seeming sexist.&quot; Meg Whitman, then CEO of Hewlett-Packard, stated that in her opinion Fiorina was not qualified to be President of the United States, stating that a business background is important but that having worked in government is also important, and that &quot;it&#x27;s very difficult for your first role in politics to be President of the United States&quot;.

As part of her financial disclosures related to her candidacy, Fiorina reported a net worth of 59 million, with 12 million in income in 2013. &quot;International Business Times&quot; estimates Fiorina&#x27;s net worth between 30 million and 120 million.

Her performances in early debates for the Republican primary nomination, particularly her rebukes of front-runner Donald Trump in the September 16, 2015, debate, earned her a significant spike in the polls from 3% to 15% post-debate, but her polling numbers dropped to 4% by October, and to 3% in December.
On February 10, due to weak results in the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, Fiorina announced that her campaign was suspended. On March 9, 2016, Fiorina endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz for President, saying she was &quot;horrified&quot; by Donald Trump, and that Cruz was the only candidate that could stop him.

===Vice presidential campaign and aftermath===
On April 27, 2016, Cruz announced that, if he were selected as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee, he would choose Fiorina as his vice presidential running mate, but after losing the Indiana primary six days later, he suspended his campaign, making her vice-presidential candidacy the shortest in modern American history.

Fiorina received one electoral college vote for vice president from a faithless elector in Texas. Following Trump&#x27;s election, Fiorina was considered for the position of director of national intelligence during the 2016 transition period. In 2020, Fiorina endorsed Joe Biden&#x27;s presidential campaign due to her disapproval of President Donald Trump.

==Political positions==
When she first entered politics as a Senate candidate in November 2009, Carly Fiorina was &quot;considered to be a moderate Republican with little history on social issues&quot; and her views changed during her run for Senate and her run for President in 2016. In 2017, she has described herself as conservative. In 2020, Fiorina announced that she would vote for Joe Biden for President. &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot;, a non-partisan organization which analyzes candidates&#x27; positions and conducts polling, considered Fiorina to be within the moderate and establishment wings of the GOP.

=== Social issues ===
Fiorina is anti-abortion. She expressed support for legislation to ban abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, with an exception for cases of rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother. In 2010, she said that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was settled law, but later reversed that position. Fiorina supported overturning &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion in the United States, allowing states to set their own abortion policies. She does support embryonic stem-cell research if the embryos were not created for that purpose.

In a February 2015 speech, Fiorina acknowledged the scientific consensus that climate change is real and caused by human activity, but expressed skepticism that government can affect the issue, and has &quot;implied that targeting the coal industry will not solve the problem&quot;.

Fiorina said in May 2015 that &quot;drug addiction shouldn&#x27;t be criminalized&quot; and cited &quot;decriminalizing drug addiction and drug use&quot; as an example of a successful reform. Fiorina opposes the legalization of marijuana, but says that she believes in states&#x27; rights, and that as president she will not enforce the federal ban on marijuana in Colorado, where voters have legalized marijuana as a matter of state law.

While running for president, Fiorina has been a critic of the Common Core State Standards. In September 2015, Fiorina said: &quot;No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, Common Core – they&#x27;re all big, bureaucratic programs that are failing our nation.&quot; This was a reversal of her position on federal education policies during her 2010 campaign for U.S. Senate from California. In that campaign, Fiorina issued a position paper in which she &quot;strongly advocated for metric-based accountability in schools&quot; and &quot;praised No Child Left Behind as setting high standards, and Race to the Top for using internationally-benchmarked measures.&quot;

In California, Fiorina supported the DREAM Act, which would allow children brought to the U.S. by their parents when they were under the age of 16 to secure permanent U.S. residency and a path to citizenship, if they graduate from college or serve in the armed forces.

Carly Fiorina opposed same-sex marriage, but supported civil unions. She later said that she hoped the nation would support &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, the decision legalizing same-sex marriage, and also respect individuals&#x27; consciences. In November 2009, during a &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; interview, Fiorina said that she voted in favor of Proposition 8, a California ballot proposition that banned same-sex marriage in that state. During the 2010 United States Senate election in California, Fiorina was endorsed by GOProud, a gay conservative organization. In 2010, Fiorina stated that she supported the Defense of Marriage Act, but also supported civil unions. She supported the repeal of Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell. In 2015, Fiorina reaffirmed her support for civil unions with the same government benefits accorded to married persons. She does not support a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. In 2017, Fiorina headlined the 40th anniversary of Log Cabin Republicans, a political action committee which supports LGBT rights. In her address, she said, &quot;Everyone has to be free to be who they are.&quot;

Fiorina believes employers should decide whether they should provide paid maternity leave to their employees and it should not be mandated by the government, noting that some companies in the private sector are already doing so. She also pointed out that HP, while she was CEO, offered paid maternity leave.

===Foreign and military policy===

Fiorina has criticized the international nuclear agreement with Iran, saying that Iran is &quot;at the heart&quot; of evil in the Middle East; that the agreement is a &quot;flawed deal&quot;; and that &quot;there is a lot of reason to be suspicious&quot; of it. Fiorina also suggested that verification provisions in the agreement were insufficient and that approval of the agreement by the international community and the U.S.&#x27;s negotiating partners was suspect because Russia and China have an interest in gaining access to Iran&#x27;s economy and the European Union &quot;has negotiated, frankly, a number of weak deals.&quot; Fiorina opposes the normalization of U.S.-Cuba relations, telling Hugh Hewitt that if elected she would close the U.S. embassy in Havana.

In a January 2015 discussion with an Iowa political blogger, Fiorina said of the Chinese: &quot;They&#x27;re not terribly imaginative. They&#x27;re not entrepreneurial. They don&#x27;t innovate. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;re stealing our intellectual property.&quot; Fiorina supports keeping the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba open. In September 2015, Fiorina &quot;offered a vigorous defense of CIA waterboarding,&quot; a tactic used by the United States during the George W. Bush-era War on Terror. Fiorina&#x27;s interest in national security issues led to her name being floated for the position of director of national intelligence by Donald Trump during the 2016 transition period.

=== Economic and fiscal Issues ===
Fiorina was critical of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) health care reform legislation during the debate in 2009 that led to the act&#x27;s passage. Fiorina has supported repealing the ACA during both her 2010 Senate run in California, and in her 2015 presidential campaign. Fiorina has called the law &quot;deeply flawed&quot; and a &quot;vast legislative overreach.&quot; Fiorina supports an individual mandate that would require individuals to carry &quot;high-deductible &#x27;catastrophic care&#x27; insurance plans and use federal dollars to subsidize state-based high-risk pools to provide care for those who otherwise cannot afford it.&quot;

Fiorina has stated that &quot;there is no constitutional role for the federal government to be setting minimum wages&quot; and that the minimum wage &quot;is a classic example of a policy that is best carried out in the states&quot; because economic conditions in New Hampshire vary significantly from more expensive economic conditions in Los Angeles or New York. Florina also believes that raising the federal minimum wage would &quot;hurt those who are looking for entry-level jobs&quot;.

Fiorina opposes net neutrality rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and has said she would &quot;roll back&quot; that policy: &quot;Regulation over innovation is a really bad role for government.&quot; Fiorina has repeatedly criticized the rules, arguing that &quot;the FCC just issuedwithout anyone commenting on it or anyone voting on it400 pages of new regulations over the Internet. It&#x27;s not good, it&#x27;s not helpful.&quot;

Fiorina &quot;generally believes that reducing government regulations helps to spur the economy&quot;. She has condemned the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, saying in April 2015 that &quot;We should get rid of Dodd-Frank and start again.&quot; Fiorina has been questioned by some in the media for stating that not &quot;a single regulation has ever been repealed.&quot; Glenn Kessler of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that, &quot;Important parts of the economy have been deregulated in recent decades. While the repeal of a specific rule is relatively rare, there are certainly examples.&quot;

Fiorina favors lowering tax rates, simplifying the tax code, and closing loopholes that she says mostly benefit wealthy taxpayers. Florina has said &quot;the government needs to take in less tax money, not more.&quot; During her 2010 Senate campaign, Fiorina &quot;called for eliminating the estate tax and capital gains taxes for investments in small businesses, and lowering marginal tax rates.&quot; Fiorina opposes proposals to increase the federal gas tax or state gas taxes in order to fund the Highway Trust Fund, asserting in a February 2015 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed that &quot;Any gas tax hike, big or small, will harm American families and hurt economic growth.&quot; Fiorina opposed the federal stimulus package of 2009 intended to create short-term job growth and invest in infrastructure, education, health, and renewable energy, calling it a waste of taxpayer money. Fiorina has said she would cut the pay of federal workers and base their compensation on performance. She also advocates zero-based budgeting for the federal budget, which would start the annual budgeting process for each department from a baseline of zero.

Fiorina favors expanding the H-1B visa program. Writing in opposition to proposals she considered protectionist in a 2004 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed, Fiorina said that while &quot;America is the most innovative country,&quot; it would not remain so if the country were to &quot;run away from the reality of the global economy.&quot; Fiorina said to Congress in 2004: &quot;There is no job that is America&#x27;s God-given right anymore. We have to compete for jobs as a nation.&quot;

==Personal life==

Fiorina (then Cara Carleton Sneed) married Todd Bartlem, a Stanford classmate, in June 1977. They divorced in 1984. In 1981, she was introduced to AT&amp;T executive Frank Fiorina, who told her on their third date that she would one day be running the company. She married him in 1985; it was the second marriage for both. Fiorina has said that they wanted to have children together but &quot;that wasn&#x27;t God&#x27;s plan&quot;. Frank Fiorina took early retirement from AT&amp;T in 1998 at age 48 to travel with and support his wife in her career.

Frank Fiorina had two daughters, Traci and Lori Ann, from his first marriage. Their mother, Patricia, was awarded custody of both children following the divorce. Carly helped her husband raise his daughters. Lori Ann struggled with alcoholism, prescription drug addiction and bulimia. She died in 2009 at age 35.

In February 2009, Fiorina was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer. She underwent a double mastectomy at Stanford Hospital in March 2009, followed by chemotherapy, which caused her to temporarily lose her hair, and later radiation therapy. She was given &quot;an excellent prognosis for a full recovery.&quot; In late 2009, during her campaign for the United States Senate seat held by Barbara Boxer, Fiorina humorously told a group of supporters: &quot;I have to say that after chemotherapy, Barbara Boxer just isn&#x27;t that scary anymore.&quot;

According to the financial disclosures filed by Fiorina&#x27;s campaign in June 2015, she and her husband have a combined net worth of $59 million. Fiorina has released the income tax returns that she and her husband jointly filed in 2013 and 2012; in those years, the Fiorinas reported income of almost $2 million and $1.3 million, respectively.

Fiorina and her husband live in a home in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Mason Neck, Virginia, overlooking the Potomac River. The house and grounds were valued at $6.6 million in 2015. At the time of the 2010 Senate election, Fiorina and her husband lived in Los Altos Hills, California, a San Francisco Bay area suburb. Between 2005 and 2012, Fiorina and her husband also owned a condominium in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, where they lived for roughly half the year; they sold the condo for $5.3 million.

Discussing her religious faith, Fiorina said that she is Christian. Specifically, she said that &quot;she was raised Episcopalian but is not a regular churchgoer.&quot;

<doc id="537969" wikidata="Q5968834" url="?curid=537969" title="IBM hexadecimal floating-point">
<text>[[Hexadecimal]] [[floating-point arithmetic|floating point]] (now called HFP by IBM) is a format for encoding floating-point numbers first introduced on the IBM System/360 computers, and supported on subsequent machines based on that architecture, as well as machines which were intended to be application-compatible with System/360.

In comparison to IEEE 754 floating point, the HFP format has a longer significand, and a shorter exponent. All HFP formats have 7 bits of exponent with a bias of 64. The normalized range of representable numbers is from 16−65 to 1663 (approx. 5.39761 × 10−79 to 7.237005 × 1075).

The number is represented as the following formula: (−1)sign × 0. × 16exponent−64.

== Single-precision 32-bit ==
A single-precision HFP number (called &quot;short&quot; by IBM) is stored in a 32-bit word:

In this format the initial bit is not suppressed, and the
radix (hexadecimal) point is set to the left of the significand (fraction in IBM documentation and the figures).

Since the base is 16, the exponent in this form is about twice as large as the equivalent in IEEE 754, in order to have similar exponent range in binary, 9 exponent bits would be required.

=== Example ===
Consider encoding the value −118.625 as an HFP single-precision floating-point value.

The value is negative, so the sign bit is 1.

The value 118.62510 in binary is 1110110.1012. This value is normalized by moving the radix point left four bits (one hexadecimal digit) at a time until the leftmost digit is zero, yielding 0.011101101012. The remaining rightmost digits are padded with zeros, yielding a 24-bit fraction of .0111 0110 1010 0000 0000 00002.

The normalized value moved the radix point two hexadecimal digits to the left, yielding a multiplier and exponent of 16+2. A bias of +64 is added to the exponent (+2), yielding +66, which is 100 00102.

Combining the sign, exponent plus bias, and normalized fraction produces this encoding:

In other words, the number represented is −0.76A00016 × 1666 − 64 = −0.4633789… × 16+2 = −118.625

=== Largest representable number ===

The number represented is +0.FFFFFF16 × 16127 − 64 = (1 − 16−6) × 1663 ≈ +7.2370051 × 1075

=== Smallest positive normalized number ===

The number represented is +0.116 × 160 − 64 = 16−1 × 16−64 ≈ +5.397605 × 10−79.

=== Zero ===

Zero (0.0) is represented in normalized form as all zero bits, which is arithmetically the value +0.016 × 160 − 64 = +0 × 16−64 ≈ +0.000000 × 10−79 = 0. Given a fraction of all-bits zero, any combination of positive or negative sign bit and a non-zero biased exponent will yield a value arithmetically equal to zero. However, the normalized form generated for zero by CPU hardware is all-bits zero. This is true for all three floating-point precision formats. Addition or subtraction with other exponent values can lose precision in the result.

== Precision issues ==
Since the base is 16, there can be up to three leading zero bits in the binary significand. That means when the number is converted into binary, there can be as few as 21 bits of precision. Because of the &quot;wobbling precision&quot; effect, this can cause some calculations to be very inaccurate. This has caused considerable criticism.

A good example of the inaccuracy is representation of decimal value 0.1. It has no exact binary or hexadecimal representation. In hexadecimal format, it is represented as 0.19999999...16 or 0.0001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001...2, that is:

This has only 21 bits, whereas the binary version has 24 bits of precision.

Six hexadecimal digits of precision is roughly equivalent to six decimal digits (i.e. (6 − 1) log10(16) ≈ 6.02). A conversion of single precision hexadecimal float to decimal string would require at least 9 significant digits (i.e. 6 log10(16) + 1 ≈ 8.22) in order to convert back to the same hexadecimal float value.

== Double-precision 64-bit ==
The double-precision HFP format (called &quot;long&quot; by IBM) is the same as the &quot;short&quot; format except that the fraction field is wider and the double-precision number is stored in a double word (8 bytes):

The exponent for this format covers only about a quarter of the range as the corresponding IEEE binary format.

14 hexadecimal digits of precision is roughly equivalent to 17 decimal digits. A conversion of double precision hexadecimal float to decimal string would require at least 18 significant digits in order to convert back to the same hexadecimal float value.

== Extended-precision 128-bit ==
Called extended-precision by IBM, a quadruple-precision HFP format was added to the System/370 series and was available on some S/360 models (S/360-85, -195, and others by special request or simulated by OS software). The extended-precision fraction field is wider, and the extended-precision number is stored as two double words (16 bytes):

28 hexadecimal digits of precision is roughly equivalent to 32 decimal digits. A conversion of extended precision HFP to decimal string would require at least 35 significant digits in order to convert back to the same HFP value. The stored exponent in the low-order part is 14 less than the high-order part, unless this would be less than zero.

== Arithmetic operations ==
Available arithmetic operations are add and subtract, both normalized and unnormalized, and compare. Prenormalization is done based on the exponent difference. Multiply and divide prenormalize unnormalized values, and truncate the result after one guard digit. There is a halve operation to simplify dividing by two. Starting in ESA/390, there is a square root operation. All operations have one hexadecimal guard digit to avoid precision loss. Most arithmetic operations truncate like simple pocket calculators. Therefore, 1 − 16−8 = 1. In this case, the result is rounded away from zero.

== IEEE 754 on IBM mainframes ==
Starting with the S/390 G5 in 1998, IBM mainframes have also included IEEE binary floating-point units which conform to the IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic. IEEE decimal floating-point was added to IBM System z9 GA2 in 2007 using millicode and in 2008 to the IBM System z10 in hardware.

Modern IBM mainframes support three floating-point radices with 3 hexadecimal (HFP) formats, 3 binary (BFP) formats, and 3 decimal (DFP) formats. There are two floating-point units per core; one supporting HFP and BFP, and one supporting DFP; there is one register file, FPRs, which holds all 3 formats. Starting with the z13 in 2015, processors have added a vector facility that includes 32 vector registers, each 128 bits wide; a vector register can contain two 64-bit or four 32-bit floating-point numbers. The traditional 16 floating-point registers are overlaid on the new vector registers so some data can be manipulated with traditional floating-point instructions or with the newer vector instructions.

== Special uses ==
The IBM HFP format is used in:

* SAS 5 Transport files (.XPT) as required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for New Drug Application (NDA) study submissions,
* GRIB (GRIdded Binary) data files to exchange the output of weather prediction models (IEEE single-precision floating-point format in current version),
* GDS II (Graphic Database System II) format files (OASIS is the replacement), and
* SEG Y (Society of Exploration Geophysicists Y) format files (IEEE single-precision floating-point was added to the format in 2002).

As IBM is the only remaining provider of hardware using the HFP format, and as the only IBM machines that support that format are their mainframes, few file formats require it. One exception is the SAS 5 Transport file format, which the FDA requires; in that format, &quot;All floating-point numbers in the file are stored using the IBM mainframe representation. [...] Most platforms use the IEEE representation for floating-point numbers. [...] To assist you in reading and/or writing transport files, we are providing routines to convert from IEEE representation (either big endian or little endian) to transport representation and back again.&quot; Code for IBM&#x27;s format is also available under LGPLv2.1.

== Systems that use the IBM floating-point format ==
* IBM System/360 and successors
* RCA Spectra 70
* English Electric System 4
* GEC 4000 series minicomputers
* Interdata 16- and 32-bit computers
* SDS Sigma series
* Data General minicomputers
* ICL 2900 Series computers
* Siemens 7.700 and 7.500 series mainframes and successors

== The decision for hexadecimal floating-point ==

The article &quot;Architecture of the IBM System/360&quot; explains the choice as being because &quot;the frequency of pre-shift, overflow, and precision-loss post-shift on floating-point addition are substantially reduced by this choice.&quot; This allowed higher performance for the large System/360 models, and reduced cost for the small ones. The authors were aware of the potential for precision loss, but assumed that this would not be significant for 64-bit floating-point variables. Unfortunately, the designers seem not to have been aware of Benford&#x27;s Law which means that a large proportion of numbers will suffer reduced precision.

The book &quot;Computer Architecture&quot; by two of the System/360 architects quotes Sweeney&#x27;s study of 1958-65 which showed that using a base greater than 2 greatly reduced the number of shifts required for alignment and normalisation, in particular the number of &quot;different&quot; shifts needed. They used a larger base to make the implementations run faster, and the choice of base 16 was natural given 8-bit bytes. The intention was that 32-bit floats would only be used for calculations that would not propagate rounding errors, and 64-bit double precision would be used for all scientific and engineering calculations. The initial implementation of double precision lacked a guard digit to allow proper rounding, but this was changed soon after the first customer deliveries.

<text>Thermoluminescence is a form of luminescence that is exhibited by certain crystalline materials, such as some minerals, when previously absorbed energy from electromagnetic radiation or other ionizing radiation is re-emitted as light upon heating of the material. The phenomenon is distinct from that of black-body radiation.

==Physics==
High energy radiation creates electronic excited states in crystalline materials. In some materials, these states are &quot;trapped&quot;, or &quot;arrested&quot;, for extended periods of time by localized defects, or imperfections, in the lattice interrupting the normal intermolecular or inter-atomic interactions in the crystal lattice. Quantum-mechanically, these states are stationary states which have no formal time dependence; however, they are not stable energetically, as vacuum fluctuations are always &quot;prodding&quot; these states. Heating the material enables the trapped states to interact with phonons, i.e. lattice vibrations, to rapidly decay into lower-energy states, causing the emission of photons in the process.

==Use in dating==

The amount of luminescence is proportional to the original dose of radiation received. In thermoluminescence dating, this can be used to date buried objects that have been heated in the past, since the ionizing dose received from radioactive elements in the soil or from cosmic rays is proportional to age. This phenomenon has been applied in the thermoluminescent dosimeter, a device to measure the radiation dose received by a chip of suitable material that is carried by a person or placed with an object.

Thermoluminescence is a common geochronology tool for dating pottery or other fired archeological materials, as heat empties or resets the thermoluminescent signature of the material (Figure 1). Subsequent recharging of this material from ambient radiation can then be empirically dated by the equation:

Age = (subsequently accumulated dose of ambient radiation) / (dose accumulated per year)

This technique was modified for use as a passive sand migration analysis tool (Figure 2). The research shows direct consequences resulting from the improper replenishment of starving beaches using fine sands. Beach nourishment is a problem worldwide and receives large amounts of attention due to the millions of dollars spent yearly in order to keep beaches beautified for tourists, e.g. in Waikiki, Hawaii. Sands with sizes 90–150 μm (very fine sand) were found to migrate from the swash zone 67% faster than sand grains of 150-212 μm (fine sand; Figure 3). Furthermore, the technique was shown to provide a passive method of policing sand replenishment and a passive method of observing riverine or other sand inputs along shorelines (Figure 4).

<doc id="537979" wikidata="Q1070474" url="?curid=537979" title="River Cherwell">
<text>The River Cherwell ( or ) is a tributary of the River Thames in central England. It rises near Hellidon, Northamptonshire and flows southwards for to meet the Thames at Oxford in Oxfordshire.

The river gives its name to the Cherwell local government district and &quot;Cherwell&quot;, an Oxford student newspaper.

==Pronunciation==
Cherwell is pronounced , particularly near Oxford, and in north Oxfordshire. The village of Charwelton uses the river name. It lies upriver in Northamptonshire, suggesting that the pronunciation has long vied for use.

==Drainage basin==
The river drains an area of . The Cherwell is the second largest tributary of the Thames by average discharge (after the River Kennet).

==Course==
===Upper course===

The Cherwell is the northernmost Thames tributary. It rises in the ironstone hills at Hellidon, west of Charwelton near Daventry. Helidon Hill, immediately north, forms a watershed: on the south side, the Cherwell feeds the Thames, in turn the North Sea; opposite, the Leam feeds the Warwickshire&#x27;s Avon through Worcestershire into the Severn, the head of the Bristol Channel. Another source rises east of Charwelton and feeds headwaters of the Nene, an inflow of the North Sea at The Wash and the source of the similar River Great Ouse is nearby.

South of Charwelton, the Cherwell passes between the villages of Hinton and Woodford Halse.

Two miles further on, the river swings westward a few miles, passing below the village of Chipping Warden through Edgcote, site of a Romano-British villa, then entering Oxfordshire at Hay&#x27;s Bridge on the A361&#x27;s Daventry to Banbury stretch.

===Cropredy and the Upper Oxford Canal===
Half-a-mile north of the village of Cropredy, the Cherwell resumes south. The Oxford Canal enters the valley here, and roughly follows, on its route to Oxford until Thrupp near Kidlington. The canal connects the Coventry Canal to the Thames, and the Act of Parliament authorising it was passed in 1769. A few years earlier, Oxford merchants had proposed canalising the river as far as Banbury.

Construction of the canal began near Coventry. The canal reached Banbury in 1778, however it was a further 12 years before the southernmost section was completed and the first boats reached Oxford in January 1790.

The Cherwell skirts the east side of Cropredy itself and passes under Cropredy Bridge, site of a major battle of the English Civil War in 1644, a long encounter with riverside skirmishes concentrated along of bank between Hay&#x27;s bridge and a ford at Slat Mill near Great Bourton. King Charles&#x27;s forces beat the Parliamentarian army. The bridge has a plaque with words: &quot;Site of the Battle of Cropredy Bridge 1644. From Civil War deliver us.&quot; The bridge was rebuilt in 1780 and this plaque is a facsimile of the original one. Cropredy&#x27;s church holds battle relics. Local tradition holds that locals hid the church&#x27;s eagle lectern in the Cherwell in case marauding soldiers damaged or stole it.

South of the bridge, the river runs through fields used for the annual Cropredy Festival, a three-day music event run by the band Fairport Convention. 
It then passes an ex-water mill as usual created by a weir holding back a millpond and a mill race (leat); this is the highest major mill. Upstream simpler mills are suspected from the Domesday Book and similar land returns.

===Banbury===
After a few miles the Cherwell passes under the M40 motorway and the industrial hinterland of Banbury, a town centred on the river, passing another mill position. From here, a main line railway runs alongside on the west side. This line was built by the Great Western Railway and links London and Oxford with Birmingham and the north. South, the railway closely follows the valley.

A Roman villa at nearby Wykham Park dates from around the year 250. Much later the Saxons built the first settlement: west of the flow. On the opposite bank is the Saxon-established Grimsbury, now absorbed into Banbury.

Banbury Castle was built in 1135 to command the river and valley. The castle was extended and rebuilt many times. In the civil war it became a Royalist stronghold and was besieged during the winter of 1644–1645. A second siege began in January 1646 and lasted until April when a surrender was negotiated. After petition to the much-empowered House of Commons in 1648, it was demolished.

A great water mill ground grain near the castle. The brick-built building and miller&#x27;s cottage have been modernised and extended as Banbury&#x27;s main theatre and arts centre.

===South of Banbury===
South of Banbury, the valley widens. On the west bank is a large housing estate built in the 1970s, Cherwell Heights, and a mile south the ancient village of Bodicote on high ground west of the river. Downstream, most of the valley&#x27;s villages are similarly set back to enable flood-meadows.

After Bodicote, the river passes an industrial estate at Twyford Mill before reaching King&#x27;s Sutton, a village noted for its rare, high spire which overlooks the river. At Kings Sutton the Sor and Mill Lane brooks join. Two miles further, the Cherwell reaches a neighbourhood Nell Bridge and passes under a main road leading to Aynho, a village a mile east on a low hill, overlooking.

Shortly after this comes a crossing of the Oxford Canal at a right-angle, flowing in on the east and out over a weir. Such level river crossings are rare nationally. The canal, a few yards below, has Aynho Weir Lock, unusual as instead of rectangular form, it has a wide, lozenge chamber – the lock lowers the canal by – the form speedily tops up the water as often used up in the fall of locks below.

By the weir the railway&#x27;s older line continues down the valley to Oxford; east of it, a more direct route (opened in 1910 by the Great Western Railway) runs via Bicester and High Wycombe to London, originally connecting Paddington station, succeeded by London&#x27;s newest main terminus, Marylebone.

The Cherwell supplied water to the engines on the Oxford route, feeding long troughs on top of the sleepers between rails for scooping up water at stations or at low speed.

===Lower course, Somerton, Heyford, Rousham and Shipton===

From Aynho, the Cherwell meanders, overlooked by hilltop villages. Somerton and Heyford, the only villages adjacent, once had water mills. That at Lower Heyford (noted as pre-Conquest and in 1086 there in the Domesday Book) was last rebuilt in the early 19th century, milling until 1946.

At Rousham, the river passes a famous landscape garden designed by William Kent. It features many statues and a near-replica Roman pagan &quot;temple&quot; which overlooks. The river terrace is named the Praeneste after the temple in Palestrina near Rome.

Two miles south, the river is crossed by a medieval packhorse bridge at Northbrook and a further mile south the course of Akeman Street, a Roman road. South, the valley narrows and becomes more wooded.

The Cherwell passes under the Woodstock to Bicester road and shortly after the Oxford Canal flows into it from the east. The next mile of the river is used by boats as part of the canal, passing a now-demolished cement works once supplied by canal narrowboats and which used river water.

After sharing their course for about , the watercourses diverge at Shipton Weir Lock (in larger, lozenge form) west of which is Shipton on Cherwell.

East of Shipton, the deserted village of Hampton Gay fronted the river, main remnants being its disused church in the watermeadows and ruins of a manor house.

Below, the river reaches Thrupp where the Oxford Canal finally leaves the valley.

In hills to the east, a Romano-British settlement stood near Kidlington and a contemporary villa in a west-bank parish, Islip. To its east is a wide plain, Otmoor, drained by the multi-headwater Ray, the largest tributary, which joins at a weir in Islip, known as The Stank.

===The city of Oxford===
Entering Oxford, the average flow rate of the Thames is then exiting after taking in the Cherwell it is .

The Cherwell reaches the northern outskirts of Oxford and runs south on the eastern edge of North Oxford to the city centre. Near Summertown it passes the Victoria Arms riverside public house/restaurant at Marston and then under a modern bridge, part of Marston Ferry Road. A little further south, it passes Wolfson College (a graduate college of the University of Oxford), the Cherwell Boathouse (where punts can be hired) and the playing fields of the Dragon School. Next is Lady Margaret Hall, the first of the previously all-women&#x27;s colleges.

The river is then flanked by Oxford University Parks and passes under Rainbow Bridge. Parson&#x27;s Pleasure and Dame&#x27;s Delight were for typically nude bathing for men and women respectively, now defunct. Below the Parks, the river splits into up to three streams, with a series of islands. One is Mesopotamia, which is a long thin island just south of the Parks with a scenic, tree-lined path. At the northern end are punt rollers next to a weir. St Catherine&#x27;s College is on the largest island formed by the split of the river. It also flows past Magdalen College.

The river conjoins again into two close streams to flow under Magdalen Bridge. Early on May Morning, students used to jump off the bridge, a dangerous tradition if the river is low, so more recently the bridge has been closed on May Day. The river splits again. To the west is the Oxford Botanic Garden. To the east are Magdalen College School and St Hilda&#x27;s College. The river then skirts Christ Church Meadow before flowing into the Thames (or Isis) through two branches; the island in between has the main shared college boathouses for rowing.

Easter and Summer punting is popular on the Oxford stretch. (A punt is a long, flat-bottom, low-topsides, boat propelled by a pole pushed against the river bed.) Punts are typically hired from a punt station by Magdalen Bridge, or the Cherwell Boathouse (just to the north of the University Parks). It is possible to punt all the way from the Isis, north past the University Parks, and out beyond the ring road.

==History==
The lowest point saw early settlement. The river is known as the divide of the Dobunni to the west and the Catuvellauni to the east (Celtic tribes documented at the time of Romanisation).

At Oxney, Oxford a Romano-British settlement grew up, being naturally protected from raids by the large rivers. This settlement dominated the pottery trade in what is now central southern England, distributing it by boats on the Thames and its tributaries.

In 2023, a Viking sword from between 850 and 975AD was found in the river.

==Navigation==
The river itself has never been properly navigable. In the 17th century weirs were fewer and goods seem to have been laden up to Banbury in modest flat-bottomed boats. A load of coal was taken up the river in 1764 as a test. Since the opening of the Oxford Canal in 1790 only a few sections are navigable, mainly to canoes and punts of shallow draft.

==In literature==
The Cherwell was mentioned by John Betjeman (1906–1984) in his poetry:

&lt;poem style=&quot;padding-left:40px;&quot;&gt;
The Cherwell carried under Magdalen Bridge
Its leisure puntfuls of the fortunate
Who next term and the next would still come back.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The Withywindle river in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has been identified with the Cherwell near Tolkien&#x27;s home in Oxford. Growing beside the Withywindle was the evil character Old Man Willow; Tolkien made a careful pencil and coloured pencil drawing of the character while he was writing the chapter &quot;The Old Forest&quot;. Tolkien&#x27;s son John suggests that the drawing was based on one of the few unpollarded willows on the Cherwell at Oxford. The Tolkien Society and the Mythopoeic Society have placed a Tolkien memorial bench beside the Cherwell in the University Parks.

<doc id="537983" wikidata="Q2081482" url="?curid=537983" title="Wonder Twins">
<text>The Wonder Twins (Zan and Jayna) are a fictional extraterrestrial twin brother and sister superhero duo who first appeared in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s American animated television series &quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot;. The pair can activate their superpowers by touching their fists and saying the phrase &quot;Wonder Twin powers, activate!&quot; Jayna can transform into any animal, and Zan can become water in any state. The pair also have a pet monkey, Gleek, who assists in their crime-fighting activities.

They subsequently appeared in comics based on the animated series and were later introduced into the main DC Comics Universe. They have since appeared in other media, including the animated series &quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot; and the live-action TV series &quot;Smallville&quot;.

==Broadcast and publication history==
The duo made their debut in &quot;The All-New Super Friends Hour&quot; (&quot;Joy Ride&quot;, September 10, 1977) and then appeared in &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Super Friends&quot;, &quot;Super Friends&quot;, and &quot;Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show&quot;. Zan (voiced by Michael Bell) and Jayna (voiced by Louise Williams from 1977-1983 and B. J. Ward in 1984) are siblings from the planet Exxor (also spelled Exor) who were being informally trained by the superheroes. Unlike their predecessors, Wendy Harris and Marvin White, this pair was able to participate in combat with abilities of their own.

Hanna-Barbera animator Darrell McNeil recalls the twins were created by Norman Maurer, the &quot;Super Friends&quot; series developer/story editor. They were originally called Dick and Jane, and their sidekick was Mighty Monkey, before finally becoming Zan, Jayna, and Gleek. The names &quot;Zan&quot; and &quot;Jayna&quot; derived from the Edgar Rice Burroughs characters Tarzan and his romantic interest Jane. According to McNeil: &quot;Originally Zan (Dick) had &#x27;Plastic Man&#x27; powers and Jayna (Jane) could transform into anything, not just animals, but they were scaled back to their present powers as it made the other Super Friends (even Superman) seem almost superfluous&quot;. Jayna&#x27;s distinctive hairdo was based on that of an animation checker at Hanna-Barbera, while the pointed ears were inspired by the character Spock from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. The twins&#x27; personalities were heavily based on Donny and Marie Osmond, who were extremely popular at the time and had their own show on ABC as well.

The Wonder Twins were the most prominently featured characters in their first season on &quot;Super Friends&quot;. However, by the final seasons, the twins were largely marginalized in favor of well established DC Comics teenage superheroes like Firestorm, and were wholly eliminated in the final season in favor of Cyborg.

The characters were introduced to comics in issue #7 of the &quot;Super Friends&quot; tie-in series (cover-dated October 1977, but published in July), by E. Nelson Bridwell and Ramona Fradon. The &quot;Super Friends&quot; comic book provided considerably more details of the Wonder Twins&#x27; background and how they came to join the team than was provided in the television series. Because of the different production lag times between animation and comics, the first comic book appearance is chronologically before the first television appearance.

In the 1990s, they were introduced into the main DC Universe in &quot;Extreme Justice&quot; #9 (October 1995), by Ivan Velez, Jr. and Al Rio. The series rewrote and updated their origin story. Velez, an avowed die-hard fan of the Wonder Twins, intended to begin a revival of the characters, but was taken off the series after the first issue with the Wonder Twins. Though the twins remained with the series until its cancellation with #18, they were used only sparingly after Velez&#x27;s departure.

Following the cancellation of &quot;Extreme Justice&quot;, the Wonder Twins showed up only sporadically in the DC Universe. After 2003, they made no significant appearance for sixteen years. In 2019, however, the characters enjoyed a revival when DC published a six-issue &quot;Wonder Twins&quot; miniseries, written by Mark Russell and drawn by Stephen Byrne. The series was a critical and commercial success, and was extended into a 12 issue maxi-series.

In November 2019, the first 6 issues of &quot;Wonder Twins&quot; were collected as a trade paper back, and released under the title &quot;Wonder Twins - Activate&quot;. In the following August, the second six issues of the maxi-series were released in another trade paper back titled &quot;The Fall &amp; Rise of the Wonder Twins&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;Super Friends&quot;===
Little background is provided for the Wonder Twins in &quot;Super Friends&quot;, save that they are superheroes-in-training that are friends of the Super Friends and were born on November 6.

According to the 1977 &quot;Super Friends&quot; comic book by writer E. Nelson Bridwell and artist Ramona Fradon, Zan and Jayna are Exxorian metahumans, genetic throwbacks to an ancient race of Exxorian shapeshifters. Their parents died to a plague when they were young, and because of their origin, no Exxorians wanted to adopt them. They are adopted by the owner of a space circus who only wants to use them as sideshow freaks. However, the circus&#x27; clown (or &quot;laugh-maker&quot;) is a kind man and raises them. He also gives them Gleek as a pet. Eventually, as teens, the pair escapes the circus and hides on a planet where a space villain called Grax (an enemy of Superman) has established his headquarters. Spying on him, they learn that Grax is planning to destroy the Earth with hidden superbombs. The twins decide to travel to Earth and warn the Justice League, which is how they come to replace Wendy and Marvin (who were planning on retiring as heroes anyway) as their sidekicks. The heroes arrange for the kids to live with an old scientist named Professor Carter Nichols and they even take secret identities as Johan and Joanna Fleming. &quot;Johan&quot; and &quot;Johanna&quot; were supposedly transfer students from Esko, Sweden, disguised with blonde hair (Zan wore a wig, while Jayna used her powers to transform into a human to change her hair color and ear shape), to allow them to attend Gotham City High School.

According to the twins&#x27; self-titled 2019 series, Zan is older by three minutes.

===In comics===

In 1996, the twins were introduced into post-&quot;Crisis&quot; DC continuity in the series &quot;Extreme Justice&quot; as escaped slaves of an alien overlord. Unable to speak English, they inadvertently attack some civilians and the Justice League. During their fight with the JLA, Zan becomes an ice golem, a water monster, and a demonic-looking whirlpool, while Jayna becomes a griffin, a werewolf, and a sea serpent. The pair are later emancipated by the Justice League and join Captain Atom&#x27;s team in issue #16 (May 1996). That same year, they appeared in the crossover storyline &quot;Final Night&quot; and in the series &quot;Total Justice&quot;.

In a 2002–03 storyline by Peter David and Todd Nauck in &quot;Young Justice&quot;, they help avenge the murder of Empress&#x27; parents, wearing uniforms which resembled T-shirts and jeans. In late 2003, they appeared in the fourth issue of the Marvel-DC intercompany crossover miniseries &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;, which was written by Kurt Busiek and illustrated by George Pérez.

In 2007, they appeared in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; vol. 3 #70, and in 2011, and in &quot;DCU: Legacies&quot; #9, a story by Len Wein and Rob Leigh.

In &quot;Smallville: Titans&quot;, a story arc in the series &quot;Smallville season 11&quot;, Zan and Jayna are members of the team with Conner Kent/Superboy, Speedy, Blue Beetle and Miss Martian at Jay Garrick&#x27;s school for the &quot;gifted&quot;.

In &quot;Superpowers&quot;, a 2017 backup series in &quot;Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye&quot;, cartoonist Tom Scioli offers a slightly different version of the origin of the Wonder Twins, set on an alternate Earth.

In February 2019, the first issue of a 12-issue mini-series was released on Wonder Comics, titled &quot;Wonder Twins&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==

The Wonder Twins&#x27; powers are activated when they touch each other and speak the phrase, &quot;Wonder Twin powers, activate!&quot; Physical contact is required. If the two are out of reach of each other, they are unable to activate their powers. As they are about to transform, they would each announce their intended form. &quot;Shape of...&quot;, &quot;Form of...&quot;

Zan can transform into water at any state (solid, liquid, gas) and add to his mass by incorporating water in his immediate area. In the case of becoming solid ice, he can also become any form he chooses, from a humanoid ice giant to a cage for a criminal to complex machinery (such as a jet engine, as he did in the episode &quot;Eruption&quot;). In the episode &quot;Pressure Point&quot;, he changes into a gelatinous form. In &quot;Terror from the Phantom Zone&quot;, he was able to transform into liquid nitrogen. In addition, he can transform himself into atmospheric disturbances (usually very localized) involving water, such as a blizzard, a monsoon, waterspout or a typhoon, as he did in the episodes &quot;The Water Beast&quot;, &quot;The Beasts are Coming&quot;, and &quot;Stowaways&quot;.

Jayna can transform into any animal, whether real, mythological, indigenous to Earth, or indigenous to some other planet like Exxor. Since she must vocalize her choice of form to assume, she must know the common name. As revealed in &quot;The Mummy of Nazca,&quot; she will assume the form of whatever animal she names, even if she intended a different animal and erred on the common name. She has been known to take the form of anything from a mosquito to a whale, as in &quot;The Water Beast&quot; episode.

In the &quot;Super Friends&quot; comic book, their powers were shown to be more extensive. By transforming into an animal of Kryptonian origin, for instance, Jayna could gain both the creature&#x27;s natural abilities and the super-powers that all Kryptonians possess under Earth-like conditions; she was even capable of overpowering Superman in the form of a Kryptonian animal. Similarly, Zan was able to transform into anything tangentially related to water or ice, including a frost giant in the &quot;Demons of Exxor&quot; episode.

In addition to their powers of transformation, the two share a telepathic link, enabling one to alert the other over a distance when in dire circumstances, as revealed in the episode &quot;The Village of Lost Souls&quot;.

The Wonder Twins have a pet Space Monkey named Gleek, who has a useful prehensile tail and who can act as a conduit for the twins to activate their powers should they be out of reach. Gleek also serves as a courier when the twins need to travel: Jayna will typically transform into a large eagle, and Zan will transform into water, &quot;jumping&quot; into a bucket which Gleek will hold while being clutched by Jayna in her eagle form.

A rarely seen aspect of their powers is the ability to break mind control. On at least two occasions (&quot;Pied Piper From Space&quot; and &quot;Circus of Horrors&quot;), while the twins were under the influence of mind control, Gleek caused them to make contact and the activation of their powers freed them instantly from the mind control.

<text>Antoine Jacques Claude Joseph, comte Boulay de la Meurthe (; 19 February 17614 February 1840), was a French politician and magistrate.

==Biography==
Boulay was the son of an agricultural labourer, born at Chamousey (Vosges).
He became orphaned at an early age and was adopted by his uncle l&#x27;Abbé POIROT.

Called to the bar at Nancy in 1783, he presently went to Paris, where he rapidly acquired a reputation as a lawyer and a speaker. He supported the revolutionary cause in Lorraine, and fought at Valmy (1792) and Wissembourg (1793) in the republican army. But his moderate principles brought suspicion on him, and during the Terror he had to go into hiding.

He represented La Meurthe in the Council of Five Hundred, of which he was twice president, but his views developed steadily in the conservative direction. Fearing a possible renewal of the Terror, he became an active member of the plot for the overthrow of the Directory in November 1799. He was rewarded by the presidency of the legislative commission formed by Napoleon to draw up the new constitution; and as president of the legislative section of the council of state he examined and revised the draft of the civil code.

In eight years of hard work as director of a special land commission he settled the titles of land acquired by the French nation at the Revolution, and placed on an unassailable basis the rights of the proprietors who had bought this land from the government. He received the grand cross of the Legion of Honour and the title of count, was a member of Napoleon&#x27;s privy council, but was never in high favour at court.

After Waterloo he tried to obtain the recognition of Napoleon II. He was placed under surveillance at Nancy, and later at Halbesstadt and Frankfort-on-Main. He was allowed to return to France in 1819, but took no further active part in politics, although he presented himself unsuccessfully for parliamentary election in 1824 and 1827. He died in Paris on 4 February 1840.

His books on English history, contained much indirect criticism of the Directory and the Restoration governments. He devoted the last years of his life to writing his memoirs, which, with the exception of a fragment, remained unpublished as of 1911.

==Works==
He published two books on English history:
*&quot;Essai sur les causes qui, en 1649, amenérent en Angleterre l&#x27;établissement de la république&quot; (Paris, 1799)
*&quot;Tableau politique des règnes de Charles II et Jacques II, derniers rois de la maison de Stuart&quot; (The Hague, 1818)
A fragment of his memoirs:
*&quot;Théorie constitutionnelle de Sieyès&quot; (1836)

==Family==
His elder son, Comte Henri Georges Boulay de la Meurthe (1797–1858), was a constant Bonapartist, and after the election of Louis Napoleon to the presidency, was named (January 1849) vice-president of the republic. He zealously promoted popular education, and became in 1842 president of the society for elementary instruction.

<doc id="537988" wikidata="Q323925" url="?curid=537988" title="Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">
<text>Donatello, nicknamed Donnie, is a superhero and one of the four main characters of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comics and all related media. He is the smartest and often gentlest of his brothers, wearing a purple mask over his eyes. He wields a bō staff, his primary signature weapon in all media. 
He is the adoptive and mutated son of Master Splinter and the brother of Leonardo, Raphael, and Michelangelo. He is the most rational and logical of the turtles, and second-in-command of the team. Donatello has a natural aptitude for science and technology and often speaks in technobabble. Thus, he generally prefers using gadgets in battle over hand-to-hand combat, although just as skilled as his brothers in that regard. Like his brothers, he is named after an Italian Renaissance artist, in this case Donatello. He is the favorite turtle of co-creator Peter Laird, who served as the basis of Donatello&#x27;s personality.

==Comic books==
===Mirage Comics===
In the comics, Donatello is depicted as the calmest turtle. While the comics&#x27; portrayal of the team has no official command structure, he is depicted as the next in command in the early stories, and the closest brother to Leonardo. In the first issue, he is the one that killed the Shredder by knocking him and his grenade off the roof. The second issue elaborated more on each turtles&#x27; personalities and opened with Donatello soldering a circuit. Later in the issue, Donatello states that he is &quot;familiar with some computer systems&quot; and helps April O&#x27;Neil deactivate the Mousers. During the turtles&#x27; exile to Northampton, Donatello becomes obsessed with fixing up and repairing the many broken things within the farmhouse they were living in. Most notably he spent days and nights fixing the boiler to give his family hot running water and builds a windmill and a water wheel to provide electricity. He also finds an old typewriter and writes his own personal credo.

In the &quot;Donatello&quot; one-shot, Donatello encounters an artist called Kirby (an homage to the comic artist Jack Kirby) whose mysterious crystal brings his drawings to life before disappearing. The two newfound friends journey to a dimension inhabited by Kirby&#x27;s creations and help the heroes defeat the invading monsters.

In the &quot;Shades of Grey&quot; storyline, Casey Jones encounters the turtle by a ravine as he was pondering &quot;the fractal structure of natural patterns&quot;. Casey accuses the turtle of using big words and acting better than everyone else. Donatello suggests they should continue the conversation when Casey is sober. Grabbing a stick, an angry Jones continually pokes the turtle until he loses his temper and sends Casey careening into the water.

In the &quot;City at War&quot; storyline, the turtles return to New York to put an end to the Foot Clan&#x27;s civil war. During a battle with Shredder&#x27;s Elite Guards in the ruins of the Second Time Around Shop, Donatello falls through the floor and breaks his leg. Seeing their ally Karai subdued and about to be killed, Donatello grabs one of the Foot&#x27;s machine guns and repeatedly shoots the Foot Elite. Donatello is visibly shaken by the violence and throws the gun away. At the end of the story the turtles, April and Casey move back to New York save for Donatello who chooses to stay in Northampton with Master Splinter to heal from his injury as well as reflect on everything that had happened. After encountering the turtle vigilante ally Nobody in civilian guise he returns with him to New York to help his brothers battle Baxter Stockman.

In the current comics, Donatello finds an armored truck in the sewers which apparently had been part of a bank robbery in the sixties. Along with Raphael and Casey Jones, he undertakes the task of fixing up the vehicle. Donatello decides to accompany the Utroms on a mission to Tepui to search for two missing research teams. The group are attacked by strange wooden creatures who shrink them to miniature size. The creatures turn out to be a group of Utroms which had been stranded in the Jungle during their first stay on Earth and had been living in secret thanks to their Quantum Inversion Redimensioning device which could alter their size. The process could not be reversed on Donatello, possibly due to his mutation, leaving him the size of an action figure. While the Utroms work on returning him to normal, Donatello put his new size to use infiltrating a terrorist organizations warehouse. He has also made a robotic body for him made to resemble a turtle to help him move around.

===Image Comics===
In the Image Comics incarnation of the TMNT, he became a cyborg after his body was partially destroyed after he was shot and dropped out of a helicopter (he maintained a positive attitude nonetheless, although he was constantly at risk of losing his mind to the cyborg half). He was almost killed by Image character Deathwatch by having his brain drained of mutagen, while assailing with mental torture tactics. Leonardo blamed the CPU of his injured brother&#x27;s armor for his subsequent brain death; however, Donatello was not dead but was somehow separated from his body, and with the help of his brothers he returned to his body. In the independent published series of the Image Comics, Issue #24, Don&#x27;s armor began to malfunction and was so powerful Donatello was on his last legs until he made a deal with Baxter Stockman who Don was reluctant to work with but had no choice. Donatello is rid of most of his body metal by issue #25 and Baxter informs him his shell had regrown and as a result he was back to being a non-cyborg turtle. Baxter died once more when Don&#x27;s metal particles would not help restore his body; as a result Baxter requested Donatello give April O&#x27;Neil his regards and he died laughing maniacally. Donatello then went on to battle Lady Shredder and the foot clan with his brothers and Pimiko. Donatello was then by the end of the issue completely rid of all metal particles and had kept his and Baxter&#x27;s ordeal a secret.

In the official IDW-published conclusion, &quot;TMNT Urban Legends&quot;, after Dr. X activated an EMP, the living armor abandoned Donatello for a new host, where it was discovered the armor had been impeding Donatello&#x27;s natural healing abilities.

===Archie Comics===
Donatello&#x27;s appearance in the Archie publications were largely based on the 1987 Fred Wolf incarnation, but with Mirage writers on board at &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures&quot; such as Steve Murphy and Ryan Brown, a lot of references to his Mirage counterpart were made. Donatello was showcased to be pure of heart and soul, being able to pass through the Netherworld unscathed. He was also chosen of the Turtles by a group of Aliens known as the Sons of Silence to share their wisdom. He was one of the few who could telepathically communicate with them. Donatello was almost a pacifist, detesting every time he used violence.

===IDW Publishing===
Donatello was seemingly killed at the end of issue #44 when Leonardo, Raphael and Michelangelo were on a mission to stop Krang from transforming the Earth using an alien device called the &quot;Technodrome&quot;. Donatello was left at the home base, and while the others were away, he was attacked by Bebop and Rocksteady. After a brief fight, Rocksteady smashed Donatello&#x27;s shell, nearly killing him.

The news of Donatello&#x27;s apparent death spread across the internet and IGN conducted an interview with script writer Tom Waltz, where he called the final scene a beautiful rendered scene, catching the emotion of the family. He also claimed there was no earthly way that Donatello could survive, but at the same time, he said it was not the end of him and his career.

In Issue #45, it was revealed that Donatello was not dead as his spirit was in an alternate plane and he was barely clinging to life. Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael carried Donatello&#x27;s body into the freezer to slow down the bleeding and increase his chance of survival. Fugitoid says he needs to go to Burrow Island to get the equipment to save Donatello. Splinter finds Donatello&#x27;s spirit and guides his son back to earth, however, due to Donatello wearing a helmet to keep his consciousness alive, his mind is in Metalhead, while his own body is being restored to how it was before his near demise.

In Issue #46, In Harold&#x27;s lab, Donatello-as-Metalhead finishes prepping his body to be moved to the lair. He tries his best to remain brave, but being trapped in a robot body has been an upsetting experience. The Fugitoid tries to help Donnie adapt to having his mind in a robot body while Harold sees to Metalhead&#x27;s repairs (the robot having been trashed by Bebop and Rocksteady). Raphael storms off with Alopex following behind him. Raphael starts regretting leaving Donatello behind and seeing him in a robot body is too much for Raphael to handle, but as soon as Alopex and Leonardo give him some comfort he eventually accepts Donatello as Metalhead and he, Leo and Mikey go on patrol while Donatello and the Fugitoid transfer Donnie&#x27;s turtle body to the lair of the turtles while Harold gets some equipment to help Donatello get back into his own body.

In issue #47, He mentioned to Fugitoid and Harold he is connected to his body&#x27;s vital signs. Indicating he could still feel his body and was slowly getting back to normal. In issue #50, Metalhead self-destructed and Donatello returned to his organic body which has now been outfitted with an artificial shell. Since then he has been fighting alongside his brothers.

== Television ==

=== 1987 animated series ===
Donatello appears in the 1987 animated television series, voiced by Barry Gordon, and understudied for 7 episodes by Greg Berg. In this series, he is depicted as the genius of the group who invents many of the turtles&#x27; vehicles and equipment including the Turtle Van, the Turtle Blimp and the Turtle Com. He is the calmer turtle out of the 4 turtles. Donatello made many revolutionary inventions, the most notable being the portable portal capable of opening gateways to other dimensions as well as an early warning system which warns of impending attacks from other dimensions or from Krang and Shredder.

Gordon reprised the role of the 1987 Donatello in five episodes of the 2012 TV series, &quot;Wormquake!&quot;, &quot;Trans-Dimensional Turtles&quot; and the three part series final &quot;Wanted: Bebop &amp; Rocksteady&quot;.

=== Coming Out of Their Shells Tour ===
The 1990 &quot;&quot; would have its first show broadcast from Radio City Music Hall on Pay Per View and later released on VHS. Donatello would be depicted as playing both a portable electric keyboard and in some iterations of the show after this initial show, a keyboard guitar. He was also depicted as having constructed all of the Turtles instruments. The &quot;Making Of&quot; VHS tape, which was set in the fictional &#x27;universe&#x27; of the concert, depicted the Turtles as real people, and expanded on Donatello&#x27;s interest in electronics, and confirms the concert&#x27;s claim that he constructed the Turtles&#x27; instruments. He is also shown helping backstage during the construction of the set for the inaugural show.

=== 1997 live-action series ===
Donatello appeared in the live-action series, &quot;Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation&quot;, as well as the crossover episode of &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot;, portrayed by Richard Yee and voiced by Jason Gray-Stanford.

=== 2003 animated series ===
Donatello appears in the 2003 animated series, voiced by Sam Riegel. However he is more pacifistic in this incarnation. His skin color is a medium olive green color; this particular color is only used for him in the 2003 animation.

In the S3E21 titled Same as It Never Was, Donatello is transported into a future by Ultimate Drako where Shredder has taken over the planet and the Turtles were unable to stop him and lost Splinter and Casey Jones to him and later split up because of infighting due to Donatello&#x27;s absence.

In the S4E17 Outbreak, during an outbreak of mutations of people and animals in New York, Donatello got a nasty gash by a monster while fighting several monsters with his brothers.

Then in the episode two-part episode &quot;Return of Savanti&quot;, in Season 4, Donatello caught the sniffles. Later, in the episode &quot;Adventures in Turtlesitting&quot;, he went from a turtle who was home ill with the flu to a monster himself as a result of being infected by the outbreak.

In the seventh season, also called &quot;Back to the Sewer&quot;, Donatello blamed himself for Master Splinter&#x27;s decompiling and vowed to restore his bits from cyberspace. This obsession caused him to disregard anything else, such as the gang war between the Foot Clan and the Purple Dragons, as unimportant. It was not until seeing his brothers in danger from the Cyber Shredder did he realize he was ignoring his responsibilities to help them and promised not to let his obsession with saving Master Splinter take control again.

=== 2012 animated series ===
Donatello appears in Nickelodeon&#x27;s 2012 animated series, voiced by Rob Paulsen. In this version, Donatello has a crush on April O&#x27;Neil (who is also in her teenage years in this adaptation). Despite Donatello being quiet, sensitive, and friendly, and a genius he also can be sarcastic and is here more prone to panicking and losing his temper. Donatello is active and purpose-driven, but at times does not understand and/or has a hard time grasping the lectures of Master Splinter. A running gag is Raphael scolding or hitting him whenever he explains something in scientific terms. His character design was also updated, giving him a gap in his teeth and a taller, leaner appearance than his brothers. In this version, he wields a bō staff that converts to a naginata (Japanese glaive).

Donatello also shows to have a heart as big as his intelligence as he, like his brother Michelangelo, care for humans and creatures that others find a nuisance like The Pulverizer and Bigfoot. His passion to help others is most demonstrated when he creates a retro-mutagen to undo mutations that happen throughout the series.

=== 2018 animated series ===

Donatello appears once again in the 2018 series &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, voiced by Josh Brener. This version is described as &quot;an unflappable mechanical genius and tech wizard whose ninja skills are second only to his coding.&quot; This incarnation of Donatello is more confident, level-headed, avoidant of physical contact, and sarcastic. He wields a high-tech bō staff modified by rocket boosters.

In &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie&quot;, Donnie mostly takes a backseat with Mikey, looking out for each other while they fight against the Krang. The two manage to seize control of the Technodrome, with Donnie organically connecting to the ship&#x27;s main controls, before being ripped out by Krang Leader. After Leo sacrifices himself to save Earth from the Krang invasion, Mikey is able to open a portal to the prison dimension with the help of Donnie and Raph and rescue Leo.

== Movies ==

=== Original trilogy (1990–1993) ===
Donatello appears in the first three live action films. He is depicted as more childish than he was in the Mirage comics and the 1987 animated series, as he is shown joking around more and is the skateboarder of the team. He is voiced by Corey Feldman in the first movie. In the second film, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot;, Adam Carl provided his voice. He finds himself dejected when professor Perry reveals that the turtles&#x27; creation was a mere accident, as the ooze was just the result of chemical spillage rather than a deliberate product, but Splinter comforts him by telling him their worth is not defined by their past. He later assists Perry with the creation of an antidote to the Ooze, which the turtles use on Shredder&#x27;s mutant minions, Tokka and Rahzar. In the third film, Feldman reprises his role from the first film. He is the only Turtle who is not tempted to stay in the Feudal Japan of the past, saying that he can&#x27;t live without technology.

=== 2007 film ===
Donatello has a supporting role in the 2007 film, voiced by Mitchell Whitfield. In the film, Donatello runs an IT tech support line to earn money for the family and keeps an eye on Mikey. He also serves as the turtles&#x27; unofficial leader until Leonardo returns from training in Central America.

=== Reboot series (2014–2016) ===
Donatello appears in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (2014), portrayed by Jeremy Howard. In this film, Donatello is the brains of the team and relies heavily on high-tech equipment and gear. His personality in this film is very calm and measured, and was also given a much more nerdy portrayal than in previous adaptations, on account of his large glasses with the middle taped. He also has a similar personality to his 1987 and 2003 counterparts where he is always talking of calculations and constantly confusing his brothers with them. He is also the one who stopped the toxic poison that Shredder had activated on Sacks Tower. Like Michelangelo and Leonardo, Donatello wears a glove on his left hand, has a tech pack on his shell and boots although you can partly see his toes making only him, Raphael and Michelangelo the only turtles to stay true to their other incarnations with the two toes. Donatello appears in the sequel, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;, with Howard reprising his role. In the film, Donatello discovers the mutagen Shredder used on Bebop and Rocksteady can be used to turn the turtles into humans, which Michelangelo overhears, leading to a brief friction between the team. He later hacks into the Technodrome&#x27;s computer, allowing the turtles to find the beacon Krang is using to build it and send it back to Krang&#x27;s native dimension.

=== DC crossover film ===
Donatello appears in the direct-to-video crossover film &quot;Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, voiced by Baron Vaughn. He is the one who located the Batcave after an encounter with Batman. After becoming allies, he soon becomes fast friends with Batgirl and concocts an anti-mutagen alongside her to reverse the effects and nullify the plans of the Shredder and Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, who developed a mutant army out of their henchmen. Near the climax, Ghul breaks Donatello&#x27;s arm from a counter attack, resulting in Donatello having to guide Michelangelo through disabling the mutagen-disseminating device, which he does by recklessly smashing its parts. At the film&#x27;s conclusion, Donatello&#x27;s arm is placed in a sling by Alfred before he partakes in eating pizza with his brothers and newfound allies.

=== &quot;Mutant Mayhem&quot; ===
Donatello appears in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot;, the first animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film since &quot;TMNT&quot; (2007). He is shown to wear glasses, in contrast to his previous designs, and is voiced by Micah Abbey. It&#x27;s established that this iteration of Donnie is a late bloomer, as shown by his younger sounding voice. He ends up forming a strong bond with Wingnut and Leatherhead due to their shared interest in technology. He is also shown to be a fan of human popular culture, referencing anime series such as &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;.

Donatello appears in the follow-up TV series &quot;Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, with Abbey reprising his role.

==Video games==
In the video games based on the 1987 animated series, Donatello has the longest range, although he cannot inflict as much damage as Leonardo, who has the second-longest range; one notable exception is the first NES game, where Donatello both did the most damage and had the longest range, though his attacks were slow. This has been carried over into the games inspired by the 2003 animated series. In &quot;&quot;, he is voiced by Sam Riegel.

Donatello is one of the main playable characters in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;, where he is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal. Donatello also appears in the 2014 film-based game, voiced by Oliver Vaquer.

Donatello is featured as one of the playable characters from &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; as DLC in &quot;Injustice 2&quot;, voiced by Joe Brogie. While Leonardo is the default turtle outside the gear loadout, he, Michelangelo, and Raphael can only be picked through the said loadout selection similar to the premier skin characters.

Donatello is in &quot;Smite&quot; as a Sun Wukong skin, voiced by Landon McDonald. He is also available as a skin in &quot;Brawlhalla&quot;.

Donatello is also a main playable character in the sequel to &quot;Turtles in Time&quot;, titled &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. In the game, Donatello once more carries a high range stat, balanced by an average power stat and low speed. This is the first official &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; game in which he is played by his original voice actor, Barry Gordon.

<doc id="537990" wikidata="Q19000581" url="?curid=537990" title="Classical swine fever">
<text>Classical swine fever (CSF) or hog cholera (also sometimes called pig plague based on the German word ) is a highly contagious disease of swine (Old World and New World pigs). It has been mentioned as a potential bioweapon.

==Clinical signs==
Swine fever causes fever, skin lesions, convulsions, splenic infarctions and usually (particularly in young animals) death within 15 days.

The disease has acute and chronic forms, and can range from severe, with high mortality, to mild or even unapparent.

In the acute form of the disease, in all age groups, there is fever, huddling of sick animals, loss of appetite, dullness, weakness, conjunctivitis, constipation followed by diarrhoea, and an unsteady gait. Several days after the onset of clinical signs, the ears, abdomen and inner thighs may show a purple discoloration. Animals with acute disease die within 1–2 weeks. Severe cases of the disease appear very similar to African swine fever. With low-virulence strains, the only expression may be poor reproductive performance and the birth of piglets with neurologic defects such as congenital tremor.

==Immunization==
A small fraction of the infected pigs may survive and are rendered immune. Artificial immunization procedures were first developed by Marion Dorset.

==Epidemiology==
The disease is endemic in much of Asia, Central and South America, and parts of Europe and Africa. It was believed to have been eradicated in the United Kingdom by 1966 (according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), but an outbreak occurred in East Anglia in 2000. On January 31, 1978 USDA Secretary Bob Bergland declared that the United States was free of the disease. The appearance of CSF in Italy and Spain was traced by in a retroactive genetic analysis. Greiser-Wilke &quot;et al.&quot;, 2000 traced these to shipments of piglets from the Netherlands.

Other regions believed free of CSF include Australia, Belgium (1998), Canada (1962), Ireland, New Zealand, and Scandinavia.

==Virus==

The infectious agent responsible is a virus CSFV (previously called hog cholera virus) of the genus &quot;Pestivirus&quot; in the family &quot;Flaviviridae&quot;. CSFV is closely related to the ruminant pestiviruses that cause bovine viral diarrhoea and border disease.

The effect of different CSFV strains varies widely, leading to a wide range of clinical signs. Highly virulent strains correlate with acute, obvious disease and high mortality, including neurological signs and hemorrhages within the skin.

Less virulent strains can give rise to subacute or chronic infections that may escape detection, while still causing abortions and stillbirths. In these cases, herds in high-risk areas are usually serologically tested on a thorough statistical basis.

Infected piglets born to infected but subclinical sows help maintain the disease within a population. Other signs can include lethargy, fever, immunosuppression, chronic diarrhoea, and secondary respiratory infections. The incubation period of CSF ranges from 2 to 14 days, but clinical signs may not be apparent until after 2 to 3 weeks. Preventive state regulations usually assume 21 days as the outside limit of the incubation period. Animals with an acute infection can survive 2 to 3 months before their eventual death.

Eradicating CSF is problematic. Current programmes revolve around rapid detection, diagnosis, and slaughter. This may possibly be followed by emergency vaccination (ATCvet codes: for the inactivated viral vaccine, for the live vaccine). Vaccination is only used where the virus is widespread in the domestic pig population and/or in wild or feral pigs. In the latter case, a slaughter policy alone is usually impracticable. Instead, countries within the EU have implemented hunting restrictions designed to limit the movement of infected boars, as well as using marker and emergency vaccines to inhibit the spread of infection. Possible sources for maintaining and introducing infection include the wide transport of pigs and pork products, as well as endemic CSF within wild boar and feral pig populations.

== Strains ==
* 1 including 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, the unassigned 1.x
* 2 including 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
* 3 including 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4

== Diagnosis ==
===Standard diagnostic tests include===
* Fluorescent antibody test (FAT) detection of viral protein using fluorescent labelled antibodies in tissue
* Serum Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection of host animal antibody response in serum samples.
* Antigen ELISA detection of viral protein (antigen) in serum samples.
* RT-qPCR test detection of viral RNA in samples, especially useful to differentiate strains. Direct genetic typing for CSF was first developed by Greiser-Wilke &quot;et al.&quot;, 2000 to trace descendants of the 1997-1998 EU epizootic.
* Virus isolation isolation of virus in cell culture.

===Histopathological examination===
* Histology of the brain shows vasculoendothelial proliferation and perivascular cuffing (cuffing is highly suggestive when accompanied by other signs, but is not pathognomonic for the disease).

<text>The Pajama Game is a musical based on the 1953 novel &quot;7½ Cents&quot; by Richard Bissell.
The book is by George Abbott and Richard Bissell; the music and lyrics are by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross. Dances were staged by Bob Fosse in his choreography debut. The story deals with labor troubles and romance in a pajama factory.

The original Broadway production opened on May 13, 1954, at the St. James Theatre, and ran for 1,063 performances, with a brief stop at the Shubert Theatre at the end of the run. It was revived in 1973, and again in 2006 by The Roundabout Theatre Company. The original production, produced by Frederick Brisson, Robert E. Griffith and Harold S. Prince, won a Tony Award for Best Musical. The 2006 Broadway revival won a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical. The musical is a popular choice for community and school group productions.

The original West End production opened at the London Coliseum on October 13, 1955, where it ran for 588 performances.

==Plot==
Act I

Vernon Hines, the efficiency expert at the Sleep-Tite Pajama Factory in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, breaks the fourth wall to introduce the story (&quot;The Pajama Game Opening&quot;). Inside the factory, workers churn out pajamas at a backbreaking pace (&quot;Racing with the Clock&quot;). In the middle of this, Sid Sorokin has come from out of town to work in the factory as the new superintendent (&quot;A New Town Is a Blue Town&quot;). The union, led by Prez, is seeking a wage raise of seven-and-a-half cents an hour, though the company president, Myron Hasler, refuses to give way. Katherine &quot;Babe&quot; Williams is the leader of the Union Grievance Committee. Sid and Babe are in opposite camps, yet romantic interest is sparked at their first encounter. Despite cajoling from her fellow garment workers, Babe appears to reject Sid (&quot;I&#x27;m Not At All in Love&quot;). Meanwhile, Hines is in love with Gladys Hotchkiss, the company president&#x27;s secretary, but is pushing her away with his jealous behavior. After witnessing a fight between the couple, Sid&#x27;s secretary, Mabel, tries to help Hines break from his jealous ways (&quot;I&#x27;ll Never Be Jealous Again&quot;). Meanwhile, Sid, rejected again by Babe, is forced to confide his feelings to a dictaphone (&quot;Hey There&quot;).

During the annual company picnic, kicked off with the official &quot;Sleep-Tite&quot; Company Anthem (&quot;Sleep-Tite&quot;), Hines demonstrates his knife throwing act while intoxicated, almost striking Babe while attempting to knock an apple off her head. Prez chases after Gladys, who rejects his advances (&quot;Her Is&quot;). Babe warms up to Sid, and they turn the entire picnic into a celebratory dance (&quot;Once a Year Day&quot;). As the picnic-goers head home, Prez turns his attentions to Mae, who responds in the positive far more quickly and aggressively than he&#x27;d expected (&quot;Her Is (Reprise)&quot;). At Babe&#x27;s home, Sid&#x27;s romantic overtures are deflected by Babe, who makes casual conversation on tangential subjects (&quot;Small Talk&quot;). Eventually the walls come down between the two, who admit their love for one another (&quot;There Once Was a Man&quot;), but their estrangement is reinforced when they return to the factory. A slow-down is staged by the union, strongly supported by Babe (&quot;Racing with the Clock (Reprise)&quot;). Sid, as factory superintendent, demands an &quot;honest day&#x27;s work&quot; and threatens to fire slackers. Babe, however, is still determined to fight for their cause, and intentionally jams the factory line, causing a breakdown, and Sid reluctantly fires her. As she leaves, he begins to wonder again whether a romance with her is a mistake (&quot;Hey There (Reprise)&quot;).

Act II

At the Union meeting, after a rallying speech by Prez, Gladys (Mae in the 2006 revival) performs for the rest of the union, with &quot;the boys from the cutting room floor&quot; (&quot;Steam Heat&quot;). After the main meeting, the Grievance Committee meets at Babe&#x27;s house, to discuss further tactics, such as mismatching sizes of pajamas and sewing the fly-buttons onto the bottoms such that they are likely to come off and leave their wearer pants-less. At the meeting, as Prez and Mae&#x27;s relationship is waning, Sid arrives and tries to smooth things over with Babe. Despite her feelings for Sid, she pushes him away (&quot;Hey There (Reprise)&quot;).

Back at the factory, the girls reassure Hines, who is personally offended by the slow down, that he is doing nothing wrong (&quot;Think of the Time I Save&quot;). Hasler has a meeting in his office with Max, one of the company&#x27;s traveling salesmen, about an incident that occurred in Peoria, Illinois. Hines is called in to try on pajama pants, which fall down in front of everybody just as Gladys walks in. Believing that he is fooling around, she angrily dismisses him. Sid, now convinced that Babe&#x27;s championship of the union is justified, takes Gladys out for the evening to a night club, Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway (&quot;Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway&quot;), where he wheedles the key to the company&#x27;s books from her. Hines and Babe each discover the pair and assume they are becoming romantically involved. Babe storms out, and Hines believes his jealous imaginings have come true (&quot;I&#x27;ll Never Be Jealous Again Ballet&quot;).

Using Gladys&#x27; key, Sid accesses the firm&#x27;s books and discovers that Hasler has already tacked on the extra seven and one-half cents to the production cost, but has kept all the extra profits for himself. Hines, still jealous out of his mind, has broken into Gladys&#x27; office, and flings knives past Sid and Gladys, narrowly missing an increasingly paranoid Mr. Hasler. After detaining Hines, Sid then brings about Hasler&#x27;s consent to a pay raise and rushes to bring the news to the Union Rally, already in progress (&quot;7½ Cents&quot;). This news brings peace to the factory and to his love life, allowing him to reconnect with Babe (&quot;There Once Was a Man (Reprise)&quot;). Everyone goes out to celebrate at Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway clothed in company brand pajamas (&quot;The Pajama Game Finale&quot;).

===Notes on the music===
Two of the songs, &quot;There Once Was a Man&quot; and &quot;A New Town Is a Blue Town&quot;, were actually written by Frank Loesser, although they were uncredited.

====&quot;Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway&quot;====
For the 2006 revival, Harry Connick Jr. played the piano, when Gladys (Megan Lawrence), Sid, and Company were on stage for &quot;Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway&quot;.
&quot;The length and form of the song remain steady&quot;, Kathleen Marshall said, &quot;but he can improvise within it.&quot;

====&quot;Steam Heat&quot;====
In the original production, and in the film version, the famed dance number &quot;Steam Heat&quot; was danced by Gladys. In the 2006 revival, the number was made with Mae (Joyce Chittick), instead of Gladys. Kathleen Marshall explains: &quot;Hines accuses Gladys of being a flirt, and she&#x27;s not. So does it make sense that she&#x27;d go and strut her stuff in front of the whole union? Hines would say, &#x27;Aha, you floozy, I caught you!&#x27; Also, she&#x27;s the boss&#x27;s secretary, so why would she be at a union meeting? I think it&#x27;s much more fun that Gladys doesn&#x27;t really let go until she goes out with Sid, gets real drunk, and throws caution to the wind.&quot;

====New songs for the 2006 revival====

=====&quot;The Three of Us (Me, Myself and I)&quot;=====
Words and music by Richard Adler; in 2006, Hines (Michael McKean) performed the new number, &quot;The Three of Us&quot; at show&#x27;s end with Gladys (Megan Lawrence). At the time of the revival, Adler was quoted as saying that he wrote the song for Jimmy Durante in 1964. &quot;It was written for Jimmy Durante&quot;, says McKean, &quot;and Durante used to do it in his act, but he never recorded it, so it&#x27;s kind of an orphan.&quot; The song was actually featured in the 1966 television musical, &quot;Olympus 7-000&quot;, part of the &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot; series which also produced Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Evening Primrose&quot;. Eddie Foy Jr. (who had played Hines in the original Broadway and movie versions of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;) introduced the song in &quot;Olympus 7-000&quot; and sings it on the Command Records soundtrack album. Donald O&#x27;Connor, Larry Blyden and Phyllis Newman co-starred in the TV special with Foy.

=====&quot;The World Around Us&quot;=====
&quot;The World Around Us&quot; was part of the 1954 Broadway previews and opening, but was dropped during the first week of the Broadway run, replaced by Babe&#x27;s reprise of &quot;Hey There&quot;. This would leave Sid with no songs in the second act, aside from the reprise of &quot;There Once was a Man&quot;. The number was restored for the 2006 Broadway revival, allowing star Harry Connick Jr. to have a second-act song.

=====&quot;If You Win, You Lose&quot;=====
Words and music by Richard Adler; for the 1973 revival, in place of the second-act &quot;Hey There&quot; reprise, there was a new song, &quot;Watch Your Heart&quot;. Retitled &quot;If You Win, You Lose&quot;, the song has been included in recent productions of the show and was in the 2006 Broadway production.

==Production history==
===Original Broadway===
The original Broadway production opened at the St. James Theatre on May 13, 1954, and closed on November 24, 1956, after 1,063 performances. It was directed by George Abbott and Jerome Robbins and was the first Broadway show to feature the choreography of Bob Fosse. The production&#x27;s scenic designer and costume designer was Lemuel Ayers. The original cast included Eddie Foy Jr. (Hines), Stanley Prager (Prez), Gordon Woodbrun (Joe), Ralph Dunn (Hasler), Carol Haney (Gladys), John Raitt (Sid Sorokin), Reta Shaw (Mabel), Buzz Miller (Second Helper), Janis Paige (Babe Williams), Rae Allen (Poopsie) and Jack Waldron (Salesman).

This production is also noted for jump-starting the career of Shirley MacLaine. An unknown 20-year-old at the time, she was selected to understudy Carol Haney&#x27;s role. Starting in late May 1954, MacLaine filled the role while Haney was out of commission with an injured ankle. Director/producer Hal B. Wallis was an audience member at one of MacLaine&#x27;s performances, and signed her as a contract player for Paramount Pictures. The production received the Tony Award for Best Musical, and Carol Haney&#x27;s performance and Bob Fosse&#x27;s choreography were also honored.

&quot;The Pajama Game&quot; opened at the London Coliseum on 13 October 1955 and ran for 588 performances – an undoubted hit. Edmund Hockridge played Sid Sorokin and Joy Nichols played Babe Williams. Max Wall, in a rare outing to the musical stage, played Hines, Elizabeth Seal, who later found stardom playing the lead role in &quot;Irma La Douce&quot;, played Gladys, and Frank Lawless played Prez.

=== Original Australia and New Zealand ===
The original Australian production presented by J.C. Williamson commenced at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne on February 2, 1957.

The cast was led by Toni Lamond as Babe Williams and William Newman as Sid Sorokin, with Keith Petersen as Hines, Jill Perryman as Mabel, Don Richards as Prez and Tikki Taylor as Gladys.

It subsequently toured to Sydney&#x27;s Empire Theatre, commencing June 12, 1957, followed by Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Brisbane from November 12, 1957. The show then made a return engagement to Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne, commencing Boxing Day, December 26, 1957.

The production continued touring through 1958, first to His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Perth from May 3, 1958, then to Theatre Royal, Adelaide from June 18, 1958.

After its Australian season, the tour commenced its New Zealand season on February 10, 1958 at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Auckland, followed by the Grand Opera House, Wellington, from March 12, 1958, where it concluded its run.

===Film, 1957===
The film version was released by Warner Bros. in 1957 and featured the original stage cast except for Janis Paige, whose role is played by Doris Day, and Stanley Prager, whose role is played by Jack Straw.

===Broadway revival, 1973===
A Broadway revival opened on December 9, 1973, at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, but it closed on February 3, 1974, after just 65 performances. It was directed by George Abbott, one of the two directors of the original production in 1954, with choreography by Zoya Leporska. The cast included Hal Linden, Barbara McNair, and Cab Calloway as Hines.

=== West End, 1999 ===
A West End revival arrived at the Victoria Palace Theatre in October 1999 having originated at Birmingham Rep and transferred to the Victoria Palace via Toronto. Directed by Simon Callow, it briefly starred Ulrika Johnson as Babe (Birmingham Rep), but she left the production when it travelled to Toronto where Babe was played by Camilla Scott, then in London, Leslie Ashe. Sid Sorokin was played by Graham Bickley throughout, earning himself a Dora Award nomination for &#x27;Outstanding Performance by a male in a Principal Role&#x27; in Toronto. It also starred John Hegley and Anita Dobson with choreography by David Bintley. It closed on 18 December 1999.

===Broadway, 2006===
The Roundabout Theatre Company revival, produced by special arrangement with Jeffrey Richards, James Fuld Jr. and Scott Landis, opened on February 23, 2006 and closed on June 17, 2006, after 129 performances (and 41 previews). Kathleen Marshall was choreographer and director, with a cast starring Harry Connick Jr., making his Broadway acting debut as Sid, Kelli O&#x27;Hara as Babe, Michael McKean as Hines, Roz Ryan as Mabel, and Megan Lawrence as Gladys. The revival included three added songs by Richard Adler. The original book by George Abbott and Richard Bissell was revised by Peter Ackerman. This revival cast made a recording that was included in full on the two-part album &quot;Harry on Broadway, Act I&quot; with Connick Jr. and O&#x27;Hara recording a second set of selections from the 2001 musical &quot;Thou Shalt Not&quot;.

===Chichester Festival Theatre and West End, 2013/2014===
Directed by Richard Eyre, the UK 2013 revival of &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; opened on April 22 at Chichester Festival Theatre&#x27;s Minerva Theatre and the cast included television personality Gary Wilmot. The production&#x27;s sold-out run at Chichester ended on 8 June 2013, and on 1 May 2014 it transferred to the West End&#x27;s Shaftesbury Theatre. The West End transfer received positive reviews from a number of national media outlets. The production ran for a limited season at the Shaftesbury Theatre, closing on 13 September 2014.

<text>This list of comics publishing companies lists companies, specifically publishing companies who primarily publish comics. Comic art is an art medium used to present ideas or stories via images. The images are usually arranged in panels in a sequence that conveys the story. Sounds are expressed using speech balloons and onomatopoeia. European comics have existed since 1837, when Swiss artist Rodolphe Töpffer published &quot;Histoire de Mr. Vieux Bois&quot;. The oldest comic publishing company on this list is the now-defunct book publishing company, David McKay Publications that was founded in 1882 and published comics from 1935 to 1950. Most comic publishing companies were established in the United States, where comics became popular in the middle of the twentieth century.

<text>There are 56 municipalities classified as cities in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. 
Each city is further classified based on population, with Philadelphia being of the first class, Pittsburgh of the second class, Scranton of the second class A, and the remaining 53 cities being of the third class.

While the default form of government for third class cities is the Third Class City Code, only 18 cities still use this form of government. The City of Parker is the only city that still operates under a special act, and has a weak mayor-council form of government. All three cities not of the third class, along with 23 third class cities, have adopted home rule charters, which give the cities broader powers to manage their affairs. When a city adopts a home rule charter, it does not lose its status as a city nor its classification. 

Two cities have adopted optional plans under the same law. From 1957 to 1972, third class cities were able to adopt optional charters, of which 9 remain in effect. Cities that operate under home rule charters, optional plans, or optional charters are also found in the List of Pennsylvania municipalities and counties with home rule charters, optional charters, or optional plans.

Home rule municipalities that are styled as cities but not classified as cities are not included below.

<text>In geology and physical geography, a plateau (; ; : plateaus or plateaux), also called a high plain or a tableland, is an area of a highland consisting of flat terrain that is raised sharply above the surrounding area on at least one side. Often one or more sides have deep hills or escarpments. Plateaus can be formed by a number of processes, including upwelling of volcanic magma, extrusion of lava, and erosion by water and glaciers. Plateaus are classified according to their surrounding environment as intermontane, piedmont, or continental. A few plateaus may have a small flat top while others have wider ones.

== Formation ==
Plateaus can be formed by a number of processes, including upwelling of volcanic magma, extrusion of lava, plate tectonics movements, and erosion by water and glaciers.

=== Volcanic ===
Volcanic plateaus are produced by volcanic activity. The Columbia Plateau in the north-western United States is an example. They may be formed by upwelling of volcanic magma or extrusion of lava. The underlining mechanism in forming plateaus from upwelling starts when magma rises from the mantle, causing the ground to swell upward. In this way, large, flat areas of rock are uplifted to form a plateau. For plateaus formed by extrusion, the rock is built up from lava spreading outward from cracks and weak areas in the crust.

=== Tectonic ===
Tectonic plateaus are formed by tectonic plate movements which cause uplift, and are normally of a considerable size, and a fairly uniform altitude. Examples are the Deccan Plateau in India and the Meseta Central on the Iberian Peninsula.

=== Erosion ===
Plateaus can also be formed by the erosional processes of glaciers on mountain ranges, leaving them sitting between the mountain ranges. Water can also erode mountains and other landforms down into plateaus. Dissected plateaus are highly eroded plateaus cut by rivers and broken by deep narrow valleys. An example is the Scottish Highlands.

== Classification ==
Plateaus are classified according to their surrounding environment.

* Intermontane plateaus are some of the highest and most extensive plateaus in the world, enclosed by fold mountains. Examples are the Tibetan Plateau between the Himalayas and Kunlun Mountains, Altiplano plateau between two ranges of Andes.
* Lava or volcanic plateaus are the plateau that occur in areas of widespread volcanic eruptions. The magma that comes out through narrow cracks or fissures in the crust spread over large area and solidifies. These layers of lava sheets form lava or volcanic plateaus. The Antrim Plateau in Northern Ireland, the Deccan Plateau in India, and the Columbia Plateau in the United States are examples of lava plateaus.
* Piedmont plateaus are bordered on one side by mountains and on the other by a plain or a sea. The Piedmont Plateau of the Eastern United States between the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic Plain is an example.
* Continental plateaus are bordered on all sides by plains or oceans, forming away from the mountains. An example of a continental plateau is the Antarctic Plateau in East Antarctica.

== Large plateaus by continent ==
=== Africa ===
The highest African plateau is the Ethiopian Highlands which cover the central part of Ethiopia. It forms the largest continuous area of its altitude in the continent, with little of its surface falling below 1,500 metres (4,921 ft), while the summits reach heights of up to 4,550 metres (14,928 ft). It is sometimes called the Roof of Africa due to its height and large area.

Another example is the Highveld which is the portion of the South African inland plateau which has an altitude above approximately 1,500 metres, but below 2,100 metres, thus excluding the Lesotho mountain regions. It is home to some of the largest South African urban agglomerations.

In Egypt are the Giza Plateau and Galala Mountain, which was once called Gallayat Plateaus, rising 3,300 ft above sea level.

=== Antarctica ===
Another very large plateau is the icy Antarctic Plateau, which is sometimes referred to as the Polar Plateau or King Haakon VII Plateau, home to the geographic South Pole and the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, which covers most of East Antarctica where there are no known mountains but rather high of superficial ice and which spreads very slowly toward the surrounding coastline through enormous glaciers. The polar ice cap is so massive that the echolocation measurements of ice thickness have shown that large areas are below sea level. But, as the ice melts, the land beneath will rebound through isostasy and ultimately rise above sea level.

=== Asia ===
The largest and highest plateau in the world is the Tibetan Plateau, sometimes metaphorically described as the &quot;Roof of the World&quot;, which is still being formed by the collisions of the Indo-Australian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Tibetan Plateau covers approximately , at about above sea level. The plateau is sufficiently high to reverse the Hadley cell convection cycles and to drive the monsoons of India towards the south. The Deosai Plains in Pakistan are situated at an average elevation of 4,114 meters (13,497 ft) above sea level. They are considered to be the second highest plateaus in the world.

Other major plateaus in Asia are: Najd on the Arabian Peninsula, elevation 762 to 1,525 m (2,500 to 5,003 ft), Armenian Highlands (≈, elevation ), Iranian Plateau (≈, elevation ), Anatolian Plateau, Mongolian Plateau (≈, elevation ), and the Deccan Plateau (≈, elevation ).

=== North America ===
A large plateau in North America is the Colorado Plateau, which covers about in Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.

In northern Arizona and southern Utah the Colorado Plateau is by the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. This came to be over 10 million years ago, the river was already there, though not necessarily on exactly the same course. Then, subterranean geological forces caused the land in that part of North America to gradually rise by about a centimeter per year for millions of years. An unusual balance occurred: the river that would become the Colorado River was able to erode into the crust of the Earth at a nearly equal rate to the uplift of the plateau. Now, millions of years later, the North Rim of the Grand Canyon is at an elevation of about above sea level, and the South Rim of the Grand Canyon is about above sea level. At its deepest, the Colorado River is about below the level of the North Rim.

Another high-altitude plateau in North America is the Mexican Plateau. With an area of and average height of 1,825 metres, it is the home of more than 70 million people.

=== Oceania ===
The Western Plateau, part of the Australian Shield, is an ancient craton covering much of the continent&#x27;s southwest, an area of some 700,000 square kilometres. It has an average elevation between 305 and 460 metres.

The North Island Volcanic Plateau is an area of high land occupying much of the centre of the North Island of New Zealand, with volcanoes, lava plateaus, and crater lakes, the most notable of which is the country&#x27;s largest lake, Lake Taupō. The plateau stretches approximately 100 km east to west and 130 km north to south. The majority of the plateau is more than 600 metres above sea level.

=== South America ===
The parallel Sierra of Andes delimit one of the world highest plateaux: the Altiplano, (Spanish for &quot;high plain&quot;), Andean Plateau or Bolivian Plateau. It lies in west-central South America, where the Andes are at their widest, is the most extensive area of high plateau on Earth outside of Tibet. The bulk of the Altiplano lies within Bolivian and Peruvian territory while its southern parts lie in Chile. The Altiplano plateau hosts several cities like Puno, Oruro, El Alto and La Paz the administrative seat of Bolivia. Northeastern Altiplano is more humid than the Southwestern, the latter of which hosts several &quot;salares&quot;, or salt flats, due to its aridity. At the Bolivia-Peru border lies Lake Titicaca, the largest lake in South America.

The Colombian capital city of Bogota sits on another Andean plateau known as the Altiplano Cundiboyacense roughly the size of Switzerland. Averaging a height of above sea level, this northern Andean plateau is situated in the country&#x27;s eastern range and is divided into three main flat regions: the Bogotá savanna, the valleys of Ubaté and Chiquinquirá, and the valleys of Duitama and Sogamoso.

<text>The NCAA Division III men&#x27;s basketball tournament (officially styled as &quot;Championship&quot; instead of &quot;Tournament&quot;) is a tournament to determine the NCAA Division III national champion. It has been held annually from 1975 to 2019 &amp; since 2022, but not played in 2020 and 2021 due to COVID-19 issues.

From 1996 to 2012 and 2014 to 2018, the NCAA Division III men&#x27;s basketball championship was held at the Salem Civic Center in Salem, Virginia. The event had been hosted by the Old Dominion Athletic Conference and the City of Salem. From 2017 to 2020 &amp; since 2022, the tournament has been a 64-team single-elimination tournament, with teams advancing from four sectionals to the semifinals and final in Fort Wayne.

For 2013, as part of the celebration of the 75th NCAA Division I tournament, the championship games in both the NCAA Division II and Division III tournaments were played at Philips Arena, now known as State Farm Arena, in Atlanta. From 2014 to 2018, the final game returned to Salem. Currently, the Final Four is held in Fort Wayne, Indiana at Allen County War Memorial Coliseum. For 2020 only, the national semifinals were to be played in Fort Wayne, but the championship game was to have returned to Atlanta, with the NCAA choosing to hold the championship games of both Divisions II and III as part of the festivities surrounding the men&#x27;s Division I Final Four; however, the NCAA decided to abandon the tournament after the second round, 16 teams remaining. The NCAA also canceled the 2021 tournament after a majority of D-III conferences chose not to play due to continued COVID-19 issues. Of teams and conferences that played, D3Hoops&#x27; top two ranked teams, No. 1 Randolph-Macon College and No. 2 Trine University, opted to play a self-organised mythical national championship game. Randolph-Macon won, 69-55.

Trine is the defending national champion, beating Hampden–Sydney 69–61 in the 2024 championship.

==Qualification==
Since 2023–24, a total of 64 bids have been available for each tournament: 
*42 automatic bids, awarded to the champions of all Division III conferences.
*22 at-large bids.

===Conference tournaments===
Schools in &quot;italics&quot; are, as of the current 2023–24 basketball season, no longer members of that specific conference.

<text>This is a list of towns and boroughs in Pennsylvania. There are currently 956 municipalities classified as boroughs and one classified as a town in Pennsylvania. Unlike other forms of municipalities in Pennsylvania, boroughs and towns are not classified according to population.

Boroughs designated in the table below with a dagger (†) are home rule municipalities and are also found in the List of Pennsylvania municipalities and counties with home rule charters, optional charters, or optional plans. The state classifies these as boroughs for certain purposes, even though they do not operate under the Borough Code in Pennsylvania Law and may not contain the word &quot;Borough&quot; in their corporate names. Home rule municipalities that are styled as towns but classified as townships are not included in this list.

In addition, two boroughs, Quakertown and Weatherly, have adopted optional plans, which allow them to change their form of local government but do not significantly change those boroughs&#x27; relationships with the state.

<text>The Bay of Pomerania ( ; ; ) is a basin in the southwestern Baltic Sea, off the Pomeranian shores of Poland and Germany. It stretches between the northernmost tip of the island of Rugia called &quot;Gellort&quot; northwest of Cape Arkona in the west, and the village of Jarosławiec in the east. In the south, it is bounded by the islands of Usedom/Uznam and Wolin, which separate it from the Szczecin Lagoon which is flown through by the Oder River, and is connected to the bay by three straits, the Dziwna, Świna, and Peenestrom. 

The Bay of Greifswald with the islands of Koos and Vilm is a large sub-bay in the southwest of the Bay of Pomerania. Apart from Rugia, Usedom/Uznam, and Wolin, the islands Greifswalder Oie and Ruden also lie in the Bay of Pomerania. Maximum depth is 20 metres and salinity is about 8%. The main ports on the Bay of Pomerania are Mukran Port in Sassnitz-Mukran, the port of Świnoujście, the port of Kołobrzeg, the port of Greifswald on the mouth of the Ryck River in Greifswald-Wieck, the port of Dziwnów, and the port of Wolgast.

<doc id="538014" wikidata="Q7598810" url="?curid=538014" title="Stanford University Medical Center">
<text>Stanford University Medical Center is a teaching hospital which includes Stanford Health Care and Stanford Children&#x27;s Health. It serves as a private hospital for the Stanford University School of Medicine. In 2022–23, it was ranked by the US News as the 3rd-best hospital in California (behind Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and UCLA Medical Center) and 10th-best in the country.

==Stanford Hospital==
Stanford Health Care is located at 500 Pasteur Drive, Stanford, California. The main hospital building and the Hoover Pavilion are within the city limits of Palo Alto. It is consistently ranked as one of the best hospitals in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and serves as the primary teaching hospital for the Stanford University School of Medicine. The facility, located at the north end of the university campus, includes the main hospital building, Stanford Comprehensive Cancer Center, Blake Wilbur Building, Boswell Building, Hoover Pavilion, Neurosciences Health Center, and the Department of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences building, as well as miscellaneous professional offices &amp; departments of the School of Medicine and Stanford Health Care, plus the recent expansions. The roof of the main building contains a landing facility and Life Flight helicopter.

Stanford Health Care provides both general acute care services and tertiary medical care for patients locally, nationally and internationally. Organ transplantation, cancer diagnosis and treatment, cardiovascular medicine and surgery, and neurosciences are clinical specialties of worldwide renown. Among its many achievements, the first combined heart-lung transplant in the world was successfully completed at Stanford University Medical Center in 1981. The hospital plays a key role in the training of physicians and other medical professionals. It provides a clinical environment for the medical school&#x27;s researchers as they study ways to translate new knowledge into effective patient care. Full-time Stanford faculty and community physicians make up the hospital medical staff.

Stanford Hospital is home to a Level I trauma center. It became a trauma center in 1986 and first received American College of Surgeons certification as a Level I trauma center in 1998.

===History===

The hospital&#x27;s history began with the foundation of the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children (the &quot;Con Home&quot;) in 1911. When the Stanford Medical School moved south from San Francisco in 1959, the Stanford Hospital was established and was co-owned with the city of Palo Alto; it was then known as Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital Center. It was purchased by the university in 1968 and renamed.

The Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine opened in 1989; the Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital at Stanford opened in 1991; the Richard M. Lucas Center for Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Imaging opened in 1992. In 1999, Stanford University approved a $185 million, five-year plan to improve the 40-year-old School of Medicine facility. The Center for Clinical Sciences Research (CCSR) opened in 2000. The Clark Center for interdisciplinary research and bioengineering opened in 2004.

In 2009, the Stanford outpatient clinics, which were running out of expansion room, were relocated to the Stanford Medicine Outpatient Center, a large new site in Redwood City, California formerly occupied by the corporate headquarters of Excite@Home. The buildings were extensively remodeled for medical use to provide facilities the clinics&#x27; old homes lacked. For example, the Sleep Medicine Center&#x27;s new sleep lab has thorough soundproofing and can accommodate a few morbidly obese patients. In 2018, these outpatient facilities were expanded to receive the main campuses outgoing Digestive Health Center and endoscopy suite, to make room for the new expansions/renovations at the main Stanford Hospital, in addition to nearly doubling the existing imaging facilities and adding an external parking structure at the Stanford Outpatient Center.

The inpatient facilities remain on the main campus, which as of 2019, has undergone another round of major expansions, renovations, and revitalization, including a new inpatient structure, renovation of the old inpatient building, renovations of the Cancer Center and Blake Wilbur Building, and new emergency facilities, all located on a plot adjacent to the existing hospital. These major renovations are part of Stanford University&#x27;s long-term master planning for renovation and medical advancement, which have included past projects such as the Lucile Salter Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital at Stanford and the Stanford Neurosciences Health Center.

==== Life Flight ====
The Stanford Life Flight program began May 1, 1984. Its aircraft is an EC 145 helicopter that can fly under both visual and instrument flight rules, allowing for response to calls in nearly any weather. The aircraft accommodates two patients with two flight nurses, or one patient with up to four caregivers, plus the pilot guru.

===Staff===
The hospital&#x27;s medical staff numbers 1,910 with an additional 850 interns and residents, as well as nearly 1,500 registered nurses and approximately 610 licensed beds. Stanford Clinics, the group practice of most faculty physicians of Stanford University School of Medicine, includes 493 full-time faculty physicians. Their areas of expertise range from primary care to the most advanced medical and surgical specialties. Stanford Clinics offer more than 100 specialty and subspecialty service areas. Under the supervision of faculty physicians, Stanford medical students and residents participate in patient care in most specialties. The clinics participate in preferred provider health care programs as well as Medicare and MediCal.

===Recognition===
Stanford University Medical Center is world-renowned for its work in cardiovascular medicine and cardiothoracic surgery, organ transplantation, neurology, neurosurgery, and cancer medicine. It has over 100,000 emergency department visits per year. In 2017, Stanford Hospital was ranked by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as the 9th-best hospital out of 5,462 medical centers in the United States, and third in the West Coast after the UCSF Medical Center and the UCLA Medical Center. As of 2018, Stanford received high rankings in the following specialties:

==Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital==

Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital at Stanford (LPCH) is a nationally ranked women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s hospital which is part of the Stanford University Health system. The hospital is located adjacent to the campus at 725 Welch Road, Palo Alto, California. It was founded in 1991 and is staffed by over 650 physicians with 4,750 staff and volunteers. The hospital specializes in the care of infants, children, teens, young adults aged 0–21, but sometimes treats older adults and expectant mothers. Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital is an ACS verified Level 1 regional pediatric trauma center, 1 of 7 in the state.

<text>South Carolina is a state located in the Southern United States. According to the 2020 United States census, South Carolina is the 23rd-most populous state with inhabitants, but the 11th-smallest by land area spanning of land. South Carolina is divided into 46 counties and contains 271 municipalities consisting of 71 cities and 200 towns. South Carolina&#x27;s municipalities cover only of the state&#x27;s land mass but are home to of its population.

At incorporation, municipalities may choose to be named either &quot;City of&quot; or &quot;Town of&quot;, however there is no legal difference between the two. All municipalities are responsible for providing local service including law enforcement, fire protection, waste and water management, planning and zoning, recreational facilities, and street lighting. Municipalities may incorporate with one of three forms of government: 141 chose mayor–council, 95 chose council, and 33 chose council–manager. Under the mayor–council form of government, an elected municipal council is composed of a mayor and four or more council members. The mayor&#x27;s responsibilities include: staffing of all municipal employees; directing and supervising the administration of all departments, offices, and agencies; voting in, and presiding over, council meetings; and preparing the annual budget (with council), capital program (with council), and public financial reports. Under the council form of government, the council can be composed of five, seven or nine members including the mayor, all elected, and each with one vote on council. The council has the power to levy taxes and raise funds from other sources that match the operating and capital budgets. Under the council–manager form of government, the council is composed of a mayor and four, six, or eight councilmen each with one vote. The municipality must employ a manager, establish administrative departments upon recommendation of the manager, adopt an annual budget, provide an independent annual audit of the books and business affairs of the municipality, provide for the general health and welfare of the municipality, and enact ordinances of any nature and kind.

<doc id="538026" wikidata="Q708251" url="?curid=538026" title="Norman Vincent Peale">
<text>Norman Vincent Peale (May 31, 1898 – December 24, 1993) was an American Protestant clergyman, and an author best known for popularizing the concept of positive thinking, especially through his best-selling book &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot; (1952). He served as the pastor of Marble Collegiate Church, New York, from 1932, leading this Reformed Church in America congregation for more than a half century until his retirement in 1984. Alongside his pulpit ministry, he had an extensive career of writing and editing, and radio and television presentations. Despite arguing at times against involvement of clergy in politics, he nevertheless had some controversial affiliations with politically active organizations in the late 1930s, and engaged with national political candidates and their campaigns, having influence on some, including a personal friendship with President Richard Nixon.

Peale led a group opposing the election of John F. Kennedy for president, saying, &quot;Faced with the election of a Catholic, our culture is at stake.&quot; Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr responded that Peale was motivated by &quot;blind prejudice,&quot; and facing intense public criticism, Peale retracted his statement. He also opposed Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s candidacy for president because he was divorced, which led Stevenson to famously quip, &quot;I find Saint Paul appealing and Saint Peale appalling.&quot;

Following the publication of Peale&#x27;s 1952 best seller, his ideas became the focus of criticism from several psychiatric professionals, church theologians and leaders. Peale was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States, on March 26, 1984, by President Ronald Reagan. He died at age 95, following a stroke, on December 24, 1993, in Pawling, New York. He was survived by Ruth Stafford, his wife of 63 years, who had influenced him with regard to the publication of &quot;The Power&quot; in 1952, and with whom he had founded &quot;Guideposts&quot; in 1945; Ruth died on February 6, 2008, at the age of 101.

==Early life and education==

Peale was born in Bowersville, Ohio on May 31, 1898, the eldest of three sons of Charles and Anna (née Delaney) Peale. Charles was a physician-turned-Methodist minister in southern Ohio, and as such, his three sons were raised as Methodists.

Peale graduated from Bellefontaine High School, Bellefontaine, Ohio in 1916. He attended and earned a degree at Ohio Wesleyan University, where he became a brother at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. He also began to attend Boston University School of Theology.

==Career==
===Beginnings===

Serving as a pulpit replacement in a subsequent summer break (for an Ohio church pastor that had fallen ill), the Boston theology trainee was persuaded by his father to abandon the formal preaching style of his training for one of simplicity, which led Peale to talk about &quot;Jesus Christ... relat[ing him] to the simplicities of human lives,&quot; and which led, he would later recollect, to a &quot;good reception&quot; and &quot;look[s] of gratitude and goodness&quot; on the faces of congregants. Leaving school thereafter to earn needed funds, Peale would work in journalism at &quot;The Detroit Journal&quot;, after a year of reporting in Findlay, Ohio at &quot;The Morning Republican&quot;. Leaving journalism, Peale returned his focus to ministry, and in 1922 was ordained a pastor in the Methodist Episcopal Church. After a first assignment in Rhode Island, at an unknown church in Berkeley, he accepted a call to Brooklyn, where, in 1924, his work from the pulpit, and in general, boosted its membership more than twenty-fold within a year, leading the small congregation to build a new church.

He received a call to Syracuse, New York and in 1927 took the pulpit at the University Methodist Church; it was also while there that he became one of the first American clergymen to bring his sermons to the emerging commercial technology of radio, a media decision that added to his general popularity, and that he would later extend in the same way to television. During the Depression, Peale teamed up with J.C. Penney &amp; Co. founder James Cash Penney, radio personality Arthur Godfrey, and IBM founder and President Thomas J. Watson, forming (and sitting the first board of) 40Plus, an organization aimed at helping unemployed managers and executives.

On June 20, 1930, Peale married Iowan teacher Loretta Ruth Stafford; the wedding was held in Syracuse.

In 1932 or 1933 he was called to the Marble Collegiate Church in New York City, a call which required that he &quot;switch his denomination&quot; - for a clergyman, transfer his ordination - to the Reformed Church in America, &quot;a transfer made... with no apparent problem for him&quot;. His tenure at Marble Collegiate Church, which dated to 1628 and was &quot;said to be the oldest continuous Protestant congregation in the country&quot;, began with an attendance at service of 200, but which would grow to thousands, as a result of his &quot;spirited sermons&quot;. Peale would remain at Marble until his retirement from pastoral work, in 1984.

His theology was controversial, and some theologians such as Ronald Niebuhr and William Miller spoke out publicly against it. They contended that Peale&#x27;s theology falsely represented Christianity and that Peale&#x27;s writings and sermons were factually false as well. Niebuhr said &quot;This new cult is dangerous. Anything which corrupts the Gospel hurts Christianity. And it hurts people too.&quot; William Miller Wrote that Peale&#x27;s theology is &quot;hard on the truth,&quot; full of undocumented claims, and after reviewing Peale&#x27;s entire library of books, said &quot;the later ones are worse.&quot;.

===Early association with psychiatry===
Following the 1929 market crash, and being presented with congregants with &quot;complex problems,&quot; his wife counseled him to &quot;fin[d] a psychiatrist who could help parish members,&quot; which he did through consultation with his physician, Clarence W. Lieb. Peale wrote books together with Smiley Blanton, notably &quot;Faith Is the Answer: A Psychiatrist and a Pastor Discuss Your Problems&quot; (1940). The book consisted of alternating chapters, with Blanton writing one chapter, then Peale. Blanton espoused no particular religious point of view in his chapters. In 1951 this clinic of psychotherapy and religion grew into the American Foundation of Religion and Psychiatry, with Peale serving as president and Blanton as executive director. Blanton handled difficult psychiatric cases and Peale, who had no mental health credentials, handled religious issues.

When Peale came under heavy criticism from the mental health community for his book &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot; (1952), Blanton distanced himself from Peale and refused to publicly endorse the book. Blanton did not allow Peale to use his name in &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot; and declined to defend Peale publicly when he came under criticism. As scholar Donald Meyer describes it: &quot;Peale evidently imagined that he marched with Blanton in their joint labors in the Religio-psychiatric Institute. This was not exactly so.&quot;: Meyer notes that Blanton&#x27;s own book, Love or Perish (1956), &quot;contrasted so distinctly at so many points with the Peale evangel&quot; of &quot;positive thinking&quot; that these works had virtually nothing in common.:

===Radio and publishing===
In the same period, Peale returned to the radio work that he began in Syracuse, as a means to deal with what he termed a personal obsession, &quot;reach[ing] as many people as I could with the message of Jesus Christ.&quot; His first programs in New York City began in 1935, an effort which led to the National Council of Churches sponsoring a program on the NBC Radio Network entitled &quot;The Art of Living&quot;, which would grow to reach millions.

This title then became the same as first of his books from New York City, in 1937, from Abingdon Press, which spoke of a power that individuals had within themselves that they could &quot;tap&quot; through &quot;applied Christianity&quot;. With the advent of war in 1939, his second book appeared from Abingdon, &quot;&quot;You Can Win&quot;, which spoke of the tensions of life, the possibility of self-mastery, and ones being one unconquerable with God. Despite a clear and apparent philosophy and message, the books did not &quot;advis[e] people how to apply [the ideas] to their lives,&quot; and they did not sell well. (Some of his other works include &quot;The Tough-Minded Optimist&quot; (1961)) By the end of World War II in 1945, Peale, his wife Ruth, and Raymond Thornburg (a businessman from Pawling, New York), had founded &quot;Guideposts&quot; magazine, a non-denominational forum that presented inspirational stories.

With the end of the war - which was marked, in the words of George Vecsey, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, by Americans having &quot;some leeway to question what they believed and how they should live&quot; - Peale achieved his first best seller, published with Prentice-Hall in 1948, a self-help book entitled &quot;A Guide for Confident Living&quot; that brought religion to bear on personal problems. This was followed soon thereafter by the book for which he is most widely known, &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot;; as Vecsey describes it, it arose from a draft book that Ruth Peale &quot;sent to [an] editor without her husband&#x27;s knowledge&quot;, and this usurpation led to a book that would remain on best seller lists for more than three years, which &quot;rank[ed] it... behind the Bible... as one of the highest-selling spiritual books in history&quot;.

Vecsey was careful to categorize Peale&#x27;s book as a best seller in the narrow &quot;spiritual books&quot; category rather than comparing it to the much larger sales figures of the non-fiction or self-help categories. First published in 1952, it stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for 186 consecutive weeks, and according to the publisher, Simon and Schuster, the book has sold around 5 million copies. The fact that the book has sold 5 million copies is printed on the cover of the current edition in both paperback and hard cover, and directly contradicts exaggerated claims that the book has sold more than 20 million copies in 42 languages. The publisher also contradicts the translation claim, saying the book has been translated into only 15 languages. Nearly half of the sales of the book (2.1 mil.) occurred before 1958, and by 1963, the book had still only sold 2 million copies according to Peale. Since then, the book has sold less than 3 million copies over the past 60 years. Some of his other popular works include The Art of Living, A Guide to Confident Living, The Tough-Minded Optimist, and Inspiring Messages for Daily Living.

The Peale radio program, &quot;The Art of Living&quot;, was ongoing, and would continue for 54 years, and under the continued and evolving sponsorship of the National Council of Churches, he moved into television when the new medium arrived. In the meantime he continued to write books and to edit &quot;Guideposts&quot; magazine. As well, his sermons went out monthly to an extensive mailing list.

===Organizations===
In 1947, Peale, along with educator Kenneth Beebe, co-founded the Horatio Alger Association, an organization dedicated to recognizing and honoring Americans who achieved success despite facing challenging circumstances. The association aimed to celebrate perseverance, hard work, and determination, values that aligned closely with Peale&#x27;s philosophy of overcoming adversity through optimism and self-belief. In addition to his involvement with the Horatio Alger Association, Peale founded several other organizations to spread his ideas on positive thinking. These included the Peale Center and the Positive Thinking Foundation.

Peale also founded Guideposts Publications, a nonprofit organization that publishes inspirational content aimed at helping people lead fulfilling lives. Guideposts magazine, one of the organization&#x27;s publications, became popular for its uplifting stories, practical advice, and encouragement to cultivate faith and optimism in the face of life&#x27;s challenges.

==Personal life==
Peale was close to President Richard Nixon&#x27;s family, and officiated at the 1968 wedding of Julie Nixon and David Eisenhower. He continued calling at the White House throughout the Watergate crisis, and was quoted as saying &quot;Christ didn&#x27;t shy away from people in trouble.&quot;

Peale was a 33-degree Freemason of the Scottish Rite.

==Later life==
President Ronald Reagan awarded Peale the Presidential Medal of Freedom (the highest civilian honor in the United States) on March 26, 1984, for his contributions to the field of theology.

Peale died at age 95 following a stroke, on December 24, 1993, in Pawling, New York He was survived by his wife of 63 years, Ruth Stafford Peale, who had influenced him with regard to the publication of &quot;The Power&quot; in 1952, and with regard to his early interactions with psychiatry, and with whom he had founded &quot;Guideposts&quot; (of which she was chairman emeritus, and which had an annual readership of 8 million in 2008); she died on February 6, 2008, at the age of 101.

== Criticism and controversies ==

===General and psychological critique===
Peale&#x27;s works were criticized by several mental health experts who denounced his writings as bad for mental health, and concluded that Peale was a &quot;con man and a fraud,&quot; and a &quot;Confidence Man.&quot; These critics appeared in the early 1950s after the publication of &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot;.

One critique of &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot; noted that the book contained anecdotes that are hard to substantiate. Critics noted many of the testimonials that Peale quoted as supporting his philosophy were unnamed, unknown and unsourced. Examples included a &quot;famous psychologist,&quot; a two-page letter from a &quot;practicing physician&quot;, another &quot;famous psychologist&quot;, a &quot;prominent citizen of New York City&quot;, and dozens, if not hundreds, more unverifiable quotations. Similar scientific studies of questionable validity are also cited. As psychiatrist R.C. Murphy wrote, &quot;All this advertising is vindicated as it were, by a strict cleaving to the side of part truth,&quot; and referred to the work and the quoted material as &quot;implausible and woodenly pious&quot;. Peale&#x27;s works were criticized by several mental health experts who declared his writings were actually bad for mental health, concluding that Peale was a &quot;con man and a fraud,&quot; with his being referred to as a confidence man in the popular press in 1955.

Agreeing with Murphy is William Lee Miller, a professor at the University of Virginia, who wrote an extensive article called &quot;Some Negative Thinking About Norman Vincent Peale.&quot; After reviewing the entire Peale library, Miller concluded that the books &quot;are hard on the truth,&quot; and that &quot;the later books are worse&quot; than the earlier ones. Miller challenged the plausibility and truthfulness of Peale&#x27;s testimonials with &quot;Great Men&quot; in his books, almost all of whom were unnamed, unknown and unverifiable. &quot;In Dr. Peale&#x27;s books these men turn out to talk just like Dr. Peale... There is a continuing recurring episode in his books that goes like this: Peale meets Great Man; Peale humbly asks Great Man for his secret (his formula, technique); Great Man tells Peale his strikingly Peale-like secret (formula, technique)...&quot;Miller also mocks the success formulas these &quot;great men&quot; reveal, such as the unnamed newspaper editor who credits repeating a single phrase [a technique in auto-hypnosis] as the reason for his success. The unnamed editor&#x27;s &quot;secret is card in wallet with words to the effect that successful man is successful.&quot; Miller explains, &quot;There is never the suggestion that hard work might be involved in achievement. There are no demands on the reader.&quot; Miller wrote &quot;All this is hard on the truth, but it is good for the preacher&#x27;s popularity. It enables him to say exactly what his hearers want to hear.&quot; Miller further mocks Peale&#x27;s claims that his methods of &quot;religion&quot; are scientifically proven. Miller quotes Peale: &quot;The laws are so precise and have been so often demonstrated... that religion may be said to form an exact science.&quot; Peale provides no scientific evidence in his books to support this claim. He provides no evidence that his methods and &quot;techniques&quot; have been scientifically tested or proven to work. Miller goes on to note that there are no scientific references supporting Peale, no footnotes, no index, no bibliography, no recommendations for further readings, almost no evidence of any kind presented in the Peale books. Miller concluded that the Peale claims were untruthful and unsupported by evidence. Miller wrote that in order to gain followers &quot;He [Peale] is willing to use without flinching the most blatant appeals and to promise without stint.&quot;

A second critique of Peale was that he attempted to conceal that his techniques for giving the reader absolute self-confidence and deliverance from suffering are a well known form of hypnosis, and that he persuaded his readers to follow his beliefs through a combination of false evidence and self-hypnosis (autosuggestion), disguised by the use of terms which may sound more benign from the reader&#x27;s point of view (&quot;techniques&quot;, &quot;formulas&quot;, &quot;methods&quot;, &quot;prayers&quot;, and &quot;prescriptions&quot;). One author called Peale&#x27;s book &quot;The Bible of American autohypnotism&quot;. While his techniques have been debated by psychologists, Peale said his theological practice and strategy was directed more at self-analysis, forgiveness, character development, and growth which has been suggested by some to be much like the teachings of the Jesuits of the Catholic Church.

Psychiatrist R. C. Murphy wrote &quot;Self knowledge, in Mr. Peale&#x27;s understanding is unequivocally bad: self hypnosis is good.&quot; Murphy added that repeated hypnosis defeats an individual&#x27;s self-motivation, self-knowledge, unique sense of self, sense of reality, and ability to think critically. Murphy describes Peale&#x27;s understanding of the mind as inaccurate, &quot;without depth&quot;, and his description of the workings of the mind and the unconscious as deceptively simplistic and false: &quot;It is the very shallowness of his concept of &#x27;person&#x27; that makes his rules appear easy ... If the unconscious of man ... can be conceptualized as a container for a small number of psychic fragments, then ideas like &#x27;mind-drainage&#x27; follow. So does the reliance on self-hypnosis, which is the cornerstone of Mr. Peale&#x27;s philosophy.&#x27;&quot;

Psychologist Albert Ellis, founder of the branch of psychology known as cognitive psychology, compared the Peale techniques with those of French psychologist, hypnotherapist and pharmacist Émile Coué, and Ellis said that the repeated use of these hypnotic techniques could lead to significant mental health problems. Ellis, ranked by the American Psychological Association as the second most influential psychologist of the 20th century (behind Carl Rogers, but ahead of Sigmund Freud), documented in several of his books the many individuals he has treated who suffered mental breakdowns from following Peale&#x27;s teachings. Ellis described one of his case studies: &quot;One of my 50-year-old clients, Sidney, read everything that Norman Vincent Peale ever wrote, went to many of his sermons at Marble Collegiate Church, and turned many of his friends onto trusting completely in God and in the Reverend Peale to cure them of all their ills. When some of these friends, in spite of their vigorous positive thinking, wound up in the mental hospital, and when Sidney had to turn to massive doses of tranquilizers to keep himself going, he became disillusioned...&quot; Fortunately, Ellis&#x27; client began attending therapy and workshop groups at his clinic (The Albert Ellis Institute), and through cognitive behavioral therapy (at that time, known as Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy, or REBT), he was able to improve his mental health and reduce his medications. Ellis&#x27; writings repeatedly warn the public not to follow the Peale message. Ellis contends the Peale approach is dangerous, distorted, unrealistic. He compares the black or white view of life that Peale teaches to a psychological disorder (borderline personality disorder), perhaps implying that dangerous mental habits which he sees in the disorder may be brought on by following the teaching. &quot;In the long run [Peale&#x27;s teachings] lead to failure and disillusionment, and not only boomerang back against people, but often prejudice them against effective therapy.&quot;

A third critique was that Peale&#x27;s philosophy was based on exaggerating the fears of his readers and followers, and that this exaggerated fear inevitably leads to aggression and the destruction of those considered &quot;negative&quot;. Peale&#x27;s views were critically reviewed in a 1955 article by psychiatrist R. C. Murphy, published in &quot;The Nation,&quot; titled &quot;Think Right: Reverend Peale&#x27;s Panacea&quot;.

Donald B. Meyer seemed to agree with this assessment, presenting similar warnings of a religious nature. In his article &quot;Confidence Man&quot;, Meyer wrote, &quot;In more classic literature, this sort of pretension to mastery has often been thought to indicate an alliance with a Lower rather than a Higher power.&quot; The mastery Peale speaks of is not the mastery of skills or tasks, but the mastery of fleeing and avoiding one&#x27;s own &quot;negative thoughts&quot;. Meyer wrote, exaggerated fear inevitably leads to aggression: &quot;Battle it is; Peale, in sublime betrayal of the aggression within his philosophy of peace, talks of &#x27;shooting&#x27; prayers at people.&quot;

Psychologist Martin Seligman, former APA president and the founder of the branch of psychology known as Positive Psychology, differentiated Peale&#x27;s positive thinking from his own positive psychology, while acknowledging their common roots.

Seligman went on to say &quot;Positive thinking often involves trying to believe upbeat statements such as &#x27;Every day, in every way, I am getting better and better,&#x27; in the absence of evidence or even in the face of contrary evidence. ... Learned optimism, in contrast, is about accuracy&quot;.

Another difference experts noted was that though Seligman describes his positive psychology as a self-empowering program completely within the ability of the individual to achieve on his or her own, experts described positive thinking as disempowering to the individual and a religion of weakness, where individuals are told by Peale they cannot overcome their negative circumstances without his autosuggestive &quot;techniques,&quot; which he claims will give them the power of God. As Meyer quotes Peale as saying, &quot;No man, however resourceful or pugnacious, is a match for so great an adversary as a hostile world. He is at best a puny and impotent creature quite at the mercy of the cosmic and social forces in the midst of which he dwells.&quot; Meyer noted that Peale always &quot;reacted to the image of harshness with flight rather than competitive fight&quot;, and the only solution Peale offers out of this state of helplessness are his autosuggestive &quot;techniques&quot;, which he claims will give people the power of God. Meyer adds that the proof that positive thinking cannot work is that according to Peale, even with God&#x27;s power on one&#x27;s side, one still cannot face negative reality, which is always stronger.

Meyer, like Seligman, noted that such unrealistic thinking by a positive thinker could easily be fatal.

Faith that you could defeat an opponent who could run faster than you would be contemptible since it could only mean you expected God to lend you power He refused to lend your opponent or that you hoped your opponent lacked self-knowledge, lacked faith, and hence failed to use his real powers. Such faith could be fatal if it led you into competitions it would be fatal to lose. As for those competitions where luck or accident or providence might decide, certainly the faith which looked to luck or accident or providence would be contemptible, and also possibly fatal.

=== Theological critique ===
Episcopal Church theologian and future bishop John M. Krumm criticized Peale and the &quot;heretical character&quot; of his teaching on positive thinking. Krumm cites &quot;the emphasis upon techniques such as the repetition of confident phrases... or the manipulation of certain mechanical devices&quot;, which he says &quot;gives the impression of a thoroughly depersonalized religion. Very little is said about the sovereign mind and purpose of God; much is made of the things men can say to themselves and can do to bring about their ambitions and purposes.&quot; Krumm cautions that &quot;The predominant use of impersonal symbols for God is a serious and dangerous invitation to regard man as the center of reality and the Divine Reality as an impersonal power, the use and purpose of which is determined by the man who takes hold of it and employs it as he thinks best.&quot;

Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, professor of applied Christianity at the Union Theological Seminary, reported similar concerns about positive thinking. &quot;This new cult is dangerous. Anything which corrupts the gospel hurts Christianity. And it hurts people too. It helps them to feel good while they are evading the real issues of life.&quot;

Liston Pope, Dean of Yale Divinity School, agreed with Neibuhr. &quot;There is nothing humble or pious in the view this cult takes of God. God becomes sort of a master psychiatrist who will help you get out of your difficulties. The formulas and the constant reiteration of such themes as &quot;You and God can do anything&quot; are very nearly blasphemous.&quot;

G. Bromley Oxnam, a Methodist bishop in Washington D.C., also weighed in with his concerns. &quot;When you are told that if you follow seven easy rules you will become president of your company, you are being kidded. There just aren&#x27;t that many openings. This kind of preaching is making Christianity a cult of success.&quot;

A. Powell Davies, pastor of All Souls&#x27; Unitarian Church, Washington D.C., added his view:

It has sort of a drug effect on people to be told they need not worry. They keep coming back for more. It keeps their minds on a superficial level and encourages emotional dependency. It is an escape from reality. People under stress do one of two things; seek shelter or respond to harsh reality by a deeper recognition of what they are up against. The people who flock to the &#x27;peace of mind&#x27; preachers are seeking shelter. They don&#x27;t want to face reality.

William Lee Miller, professor in religious studies at the University of Virginia, expressed similar concerns: &quot;The absolute power that Dr. Peale&#x27;s followers insist on granting to their Positive Thinking may betray, however, a note of desperation. The optimism is no longer the healthy-minded kind, looking at life whole and seeing it good, but an optimism arranged by a very careful and very anxious selection of the particular bits and pieces of reality one is willing to acknowledge. It is not the response of an expanding epoch when failure, loneliness, death, war, taxes, and the limitations and fragmentariness of all human striving are naturally far from consciousness, but of an anxious time when they are all too present in consciousness and must be thrust aside with slogans and &quot;formulas,&quot; assaulted with clenched fists and gritted teeth, and battered down with the insistence on the power of Positive Thinking. The success striving is different, too. The Horatio Alger type seems to have had a simple, clear confidence in getting ahead by mastering a craft, by inventing something out in the barn, or by doing an outstanding job as office boy. The Peale fan has no such confidence and trusts less in such solid realities as ability and work and talent than in the ritual repetition of spirit lifters and thought conditioners written on cards and on the determined refusal to think gloomy thoughts.

In spite of the attacks, Peale did not resign from his church, though he threatened that he would repeatedly. He also never challenged or rebutted his critics directly. Meanwhile, his book &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot; had stopped selling by 1958. As Donald Meyer noted,

Religious scholars, however, warned the public not to believe Peale just because he was a minister. They said the Peale message was not only false factually but also misrepresented Christianity. Reinhold Niebuhr told the public the Peale message was &quot;a partial picture of Christianity, a sort of half-truth&quot;, and added &quot;The basic sin of this cult is its egocentricity. It puts &#x27;self&#x27; instead of the cross at the center of the picture&quot;. Edmund Fuller, novelist, book critic, and book review editor of the Episcopal Churchnews took it a step further. &quot;The Peale products and their like are equated blatantly with Christian teaching and preaching. They are represented as a revival or response in Christianity with which they have no valid connection. They influence, mislead and often disillusion sick, maladjusted, unhappy or ill-constructed people, obscuring for them the Christian realities. They offer easy comforts, easy solutions to problems and mysteries that sometimes perhaps, have no comforts or solutions at all, in glib, worldly terms. They offer a cheap &#x27;happiness&#x27; in lieu of the joy Christianity can offer, sometimes in the midst of suffering. The panacea of positive thinking has been called by qualified people a positive hazard to the delicate marginal areas of mental health&quot;.

Meyer noted Peale&#x27;s influence over his followers began when &quot;Peale had &#x27;discovered&#x27; the power of suggestion over the human mind, and therewith, had caught up with Henry Wood, Charles Fillmore, and Emmett Fox, sixty forty and twenty years before him. He was teaching Mental Photography all over again. Thoughts were things&quot;. Meyer described Peale&#x27;s religion: &quot;Peale&#x27;s aim in preaching positive thinking was not that of inducing contemplative states of Oneness nor of advancing self-insight nor of strengthening conscious will, let alone sensitizing people to their world. The clue lay here in Peale&#x27;s reiterated concern that the operation of his positive thoughts and thought conditioners become &#x27;automatic&#x27;, that the individual truly become &#x27;conditioned ...&#x27; But was the automated power of positive thinking liberty or just one more form of mind-cure hypnotism? Was this new power really health or simply further weakness disguised?&quot; After considering all points of view, Meyer answered his own questions, and concluded positive thinking was a religion of &quot;weakness&quot;. &quot;Peale&#x27;s phenomenal popularity represented a culture in impasse. The psychology for which the cult was also religion culminated the treatment of weakness by weakness&quot;.

===Political controversies===
====Peale and rightist/anti-semitic claims====

For a time, Peale was acting chairman and Secretary of the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government (NCUCG), a pressure group opposed to Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s policies. In 1938, he was summoned by a Senate Committee Investigating Lobbying Activities, to answer questions concerning the NCUCG&#x27;s activities.

Also. late in 1938, Peale appeared with Elizabeth Dilling, the Reverend Edward Lodge Curran, and other figures at a &quot;Mass Meeting and Pro-American Rally&quot; (on October 30), at the Commodore Hotel in New York; this event was later described by Arthur Derounian (John Roy Carlson) in his 1943 book &quot;Under Cover&quot;. Rev. Curran was a known supporter of Franco and other right-wing causes, as well as being &quot;an anti‐communist and... an advocate of the, &#x27;social justice&#x27; credo of Father [Charles] Coughlin, who was eventually ordered, off the air by his superiors&quot; (and who Peale had earlier called out and harshly criticized for his &quot;bizarre demogogy&quot; in 1935). Peale said that he was distressed by Derounian&#x27;s book, that he had been badgered into giving the convocation (a pre-meeting prayer) by a parishioner, and that he had no idea of the nature of the rally. He considered but was advised against filing a defamation case against the publisher, Putnam&#x27;s, as it was not feasible given the fact that he had in fact delivered the convocation as described.

In 1943, after the U.S. entry into World War II, Peale preached a sermon denouncing antisemitism and demanding that the government and church take steps to &quot;stamp it out.&quot; As late as 1944, Peale was still described as the Chairman of the Committee for Constitutional Government, and had his signature appended to its publications.

====Peale and Adlai Stevenson====
Peale is also remembered in politics because of the Adlai Stevenson quote: &quot;I find Saint Paul appealing and Saint Peale appalling.&quot; The origin of the quote can be traced back to the 1952 election when Stevenson was informed by a reporter that Peale was accusing him of being unfit for the presidency because he was divorced. Later during his 1956 campaign for president against Dwight Eisenhower, Stevenson was introduced at a speech with: &quot;Gov. Stevenson, we want to make it clear you are here as a courtesy because Dr. Norman Vincent Peale has instructed us to vote for your opponent.&quot; Stevenson stepped to the podium and quipped, &quot;Speaking as a Christian, I find the Apostle Paul appealing and the Apostle Peale appalling.&quot; In 1960, a reporter asked Stevenson about a comment in which he denounced Peale for accusing John F. Kennedy of being unfit for the presidency because he was Catholic, to which Stevenson responded: &quot;Yes, you can say that I find Paul appealing and Peale appalling.&quot;

Stevenson continued to lampoon Peale on the campaign trail in speeches for Kennedy. Though Richard Nixon and other Republicans tried to distance themselves from the furor that was caused by Peale&#x27;s anti-Catholic stance, Democrats did not let voters forget it. President Harry Truman, for one, accused Nixon of tacitly approving Peale&#x27;s anti-Catholic sentiment, and it remained a hot issue on the campaign trail. Regarding Peale&#x27;s intrusion into Republican politics, Stevenson said in this transcript of a speech given in San Francisco: &quot;Richard Nixon has tried to step aside in favor of Norman Vincent Peale (APPLAUSE, LAUGHTER) ... We can only surmise that Mr. Nixon has been reading &#x27;The Power of Positive Thinking.&#x27; (APPLAUSE). America was not built by wishful thinking. It was built by realists, and it will not be saved by guesswork and self-deception. It will only be saved by hard work and facing the facts.&quot;

At a later date, according to one report, Stevenson and Peale met, and Stevenson apologized to Peale for any personal pain that his comments might have caused Peale, though Stevenson never publicly recanted the substance of his statements. There is no record of Peale apologizing to Stevenson for his attacks on Stevenson. Historians of the 1950s, Miller and Nowak, argued that even Peale&#x27;s &quot;positive thinking&quot; message was by implication politically conservative: &quot;The underlying assumption of Peale&#x27;s teaching was that nearly all basic problems were personal.&quot;

====Peale and John F. Kennedy====
Peale was invited to attend a strategy conference of about 30 Evangelicals in Montreux, Switzerland, by its host, the well-known evangelist Billy Graham, in mid-August 1960. There they agreed to kick off a group called The National Conference of Citizens for Religious Freedom in Washington the following month. On September 7, Peale served as its chairman and spoke for 150 Protestant clergymen, opposing the election of John F. Kennedy as president. &quot;Faced with the election of a Catholic,&quot; Peale declared, &quot;our culture is at stake.&quot;

In a written manifesto, Peale and his group also declared that Kennedy would serve the interests of the Catholic Church before he would serve the interests of the United States: &quot;It is inconceivable that a Roman Catholic president would not be under extreme pressure by the hierarchy of his church to accede to its policies with respect to foreign interests,&quot; and the election of a Catholic might even end free speech in America.

Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr responded, &quot;Dr. Peale and his associates ... show blind prejudice.&quot; Protestant Episcopal Bishop James Pike echoed Niebuhr: &quot;Any argument which would rule out a Roman Catholic just because he is Roman Catholic is both bigotry and a violation of the constitutional guarantee of no religious test for public office.&quot; Peale&#x27;s statement was also condemned by former President Harry Truman, the Board of Rabbis, and other leading Protestants such as Paul Tillich and John C. Bennett. Peale recanted his statements and he was later fired by his own committee. As conservative William F. Buckley described the fallout: &quot;When ... The Norman Vincent Peale Committee was organized, on the program that a vote for Kennedy was a vote to repeal the First Amendment to the Constitution, the Jesuits fired their Big Bertha, and Dr. Peale fled from the field, mortally wounded.&quot; Peale subsequently went into hiding and threatened to resign from his church. The fallout continued as Peale was condemned in a statement by one hundred religious leaders and dropped as a syndicated columnist by a dozen newspapers.

== Influence ==
Five U.S., presidents (Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush) spoke well of Peale in the documentary about his life, &quot;Positive Thinking: The Norman Vincent Peale Story&quot;.

The Reverend Billy Graham said at the National Council of Churches on June 12, 1966, that &quot;I don&#x27;t know of anyone who had done more for the kingdom of God than Norman and Ruth Peale or have meant any more in my life for the encouragement they have given me.&quot;

Mary L. Trump in &quot;Too Much and Never Enough&quot; wrote that Donald Trump&#x27;s father, Fred Trump, was heavily influenced by Peale and that the Trump family regularly attended Peale&#x27;s sermons during the 1950s. As a child, Donald Trump attended Marble Collegiate Church with his parents. Both he and his two sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, were married there. Trump has repeatedly praised Peale and cited him as a formative influence. Peale officiated Donald Trump&#x27;s first wedding.

Scott Adams, creator of &quot;Dilbert&quot;, says Peale&#x27;s writing influenced him to achieve success.

At the invitation of Robert R. Spitzer, former under-secretary in the Ford administration, Peale, accompanied by his wife, Ruth, spoke several times to the student leaders at MSOE University prior to passing in 1993, influencing engineers, technical writers, managers, and architects for decades who today serve as executives in companies like GE, Nvidia, and many others.

<doc id="538029" wikidata="Q647879" url="?curid=538029" title="Bay of Greifswald">
<text>The Bay of Greifswald or Greifswald Bodden () is a basin in the southwestern Baltic Sea, off the shores of Germany in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. With an area of 514 km², it is the largest Bodden of the German Baltic coast.

To the west is the island of Rügen; to the southeast, the island of Usedom; to the east, the Bay of Pomerania, and to the south, the German mainland. The bay is also joined to the Baltic Sea through the Strelasund, a narrow sound separating Rügen from the mainland. The bay&#x27;s northern end is sometimes called the &quot;Rügischer Bodden&quot;.

The bay itself has a heavily indented coastline, making it a bay of bays. The headlands of Mönchgut (in east Rügen) and Zudar (in south Rügen) – the former actually being made up of several peninsulae – subdivide the bay into many smaller bays. The bay&#x27;s main port is Greifswald. Amongst the islands in the east of the &quot;bodden&quot; are Vilm, Koos, Riems and the former island of Stubber, now a sandbank.

The Bay of Greifswald is quite shallow, with an average depth of 5.6 m, and a maximum depth of 13.5 m. Its water is brackish rather than briny owing to inflow from rivers, and the Baltic Sea&#x27;s complex hydrography (saltier water is generally found only at greater depths there). The average salinity is at 7 to 8 psu, ranging from 5.3 and 12.2 psu.

Before German reunification in 1990, the Bay of Greifswald was a public watersports venue, unlike most of East Germany&#x27;s Baltic coast. The local geography made it easy to keep watch over the bay, thereby thwarting those who thought to use it to flee the country. The place outside the Warsaw Pact nearest the bay was the Danish island of Bornholm, more than 100 km away.

<doc id="538030" wikidata="Q1643491" url="?curid=538030" title="Höganäs Keramik">
<text>Höganäs Keramik began its manufacturing operations in 1909. It is now a design company and a part of Iittala Group, which is also known for BodaNova, Rörstrand and Iittala design brands.

The company&#x27;s range includes stoneware from Höganäs Keramik, cutlery, glass, serving products from BodaNova and porcelain tableware from Rörstrand. 

== History ==
The company was founded in 1909 and was originally called Andersson &amp; Johansson&#x27;s Pottery Factory. Sigfrid Johansson was glazier and colleague Karl Andersson was master turner. The production of ceramics in earthenware was initially conducted in rather modest forms, but already after five years - 1914 - it was possible to participate in the Baltic exhibition in Malmö. During the 1920s, the factory was expanded to accommodate five turntables. Since Höganäs AB in 1926 switched completely to stoneware production, it was possible to take over their premises for pottery production. During the 1930s came the first own collections. They now began to manufacture various refractory products for trade, including ashtrays with red glaze. 

A factory twice the size was taken into use in the 1940s, and in 1948 the business was transformed into a limited company. Molds, pots and pans became increasingly common elements in the range. During the exhibition H55 in Helsingborg, the ceramic series Old Höganäs was launched, inspired by the light lead-glazed goods from Höganäsbolaget. During this time, several well-known artists are also associated with the factory, including John Andersson, Signe Persson-Melin and Hertha Bengtsson. </text><links>

<doc id="538031" wikidata="Q47206" url="?curid=538031" title="List of municipalities in Tennessee">
<text>Tennessee is a state located in the Southern United States. There are 346 municipalities in the state of Tennessee. Municipalities in the state are designated as &quot;cities&quot; or &quot;towns&quot;. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, 3,564,494 Tennesseans, or just over 56% of the state&#x27;s total population of 6,346,105, lived in these 346 municipalities. The remainder lived in unincorporated areas.

==Municipal charters==
Before 1954, all Tennessee municipalities were established by private act of the state legislature and operated under charters established by private act of the legislature. As of 2007, 212 of the state&#x27;s municipalities were operating under charters established by private act of the legislature. In 1953, amendments to the Tennessee Constitution prohibited subsequent incorporations by private act and provided for several new forms of municipal charter. Fourteen cities, including Memphis, Knoxville, and Chattanooga, three of the state&#x27;s four largest cities, are &quot;home rule cities&quot; organized under charters approved by referendum of the citizens. Home rule charters are authorized by Article XI, Section 9, of the Tennessee State Constitution, as amended in 1953. Other municipalities are incorporated under one of several standardized types of charter authorized by state statute:
* 67 cities use a mayor-aldermanic charter under Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) §6-1-101 &quot;et seq.&quot; Hendersonville is the largest city using this type of charter.
* 49 cities use a uniform city manager-commission charter under TCA §6-18-101 &quot;et seq.&quot; Brentwood is the largest city operating with a uniform manager-commission charter.
* Two cities (Elizabethton and Union City) are incorporated under a modified city manager-council charter under TCA §6-30-101 &quot;et seq.&quot;
* Consolidated city-county governments exist in three places: Nashville and Davidson County, Lynchburg and Moore County, and Hartsville and Trousdale County. City-county government consolidation is authorized by the Tennessee Constitution as amended in 1953 and TCA Title 7.

Some Tennessee municipalities are called &quot;cities&quot; and others are called &quot;towns.&quot; These terms do not have legal significance in Tennessee and are not related to population, date of establishment, or type of municipal charter.

Under current state law (TCA Title 6), a minimum of 1,500 residents are required to incorporate as a new municipality under the mayor-alderman or city manager-commission charter, and a minimum of 5,000 residents are required to incorporate under a modified city manager-council charter. In general, unincorporated areas within three miles of an existing municipality (within five miles if the municipality has a population of 100,000 or more) are not permitted to incorporate as new municipalities. Provisions for incorporation were less restrictive in the past. The capital of Tennessee is Nashville.

==List of incorporated cities and towns==

* A All but one of Tennessee&#x27;s county seats are municipalities. The exception is Blountville, county seat of Sullivan County.
* B For municipalities located in more than one county, the primary county (according to U.S. Census) is listed first.

<text>The Bay of Mecklenburg ( or &quot;Mecklenburgische Bucht&quot;; ), also known as the Mecklenburg Bay or Mecklenburg Bight, is a long narrow basin making up the southwestern finger-like arm of the Baltic Sea, between the shores of Germany to the south and the Danish islands of Lolland, Falster, and Møn to the north, the shores of Jutland to the west, and joining the largest part of the Baltic to the east.

The Bay of Mecklenburg, which includes the Bay of Wismar and the Bay of Lübeck, connects to the Bay of Kiel in the northwest. Notable ports in the bay are Lübeck, Rostock and Wismar.

== The Blinkerwall ==
In 2024, a long wall was discovered on the seabed at a depth of , off the coast. Named &quot;the Blinkerwall&quot; by its discoverers, the wall is around high. Its direction changes when it meets a series of larger boulders. In total, the wall&#x27;s stones weigh more than 142 tonnes. It is thought to be Europe&#x27;s oldest megastructure (around 10,000 years old) and may have been used by hunter-gatherers as a driving lane for pursuit of herds of reindeer.

The wall was constructed on land (perhaps on a lake shore) in the period after the Weichselian glaciation, when much of the southern Baltic area was dry land. In the millennia following this, post-glacial rebound caused the Baltic Shield to rise and the southern Baltic area to sink. The waters of the Baltic Sea inundated the site. This process preserves some Stone Age artifacts, which are more likely to have been erased had they remained above water. Stone Age structures have also been discovered in the inundated lands west of Denmark, the area known as Doggerland.

<text>The Bay of Lübeck (, ) is a basin in the southwestern Baltic Sea, off the shores of the German states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Schleswig-Holstein. It forms the southwestern part of the Bay of Mecklenburg.

The main port is Travemünde, a borough of the city of Lübeck, at the mouth of river Trave. The Elbe–Lübeck Canal connects the Baltic Sea with the Elbe River. The bay is surrounded by the land strips of Ostholstein and Nordwestmecklenburg. Located in the North of the Bay, the Hansa-Park amusement park creates a popular sight for families all around the region and Southern Denmark. The Pötenitzer Wiek Lake splits the states of Schleswig-Holstein and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and got historical attention, as it gave East Germany refugees the possibility to flee from East Germany into West Germany.

<text>Pogradec (, ) is the eleventh most populous city in Albania and the capital of the eponymous municipality. It is located on a narrow plain between two mountain chains along the southwestern banks of the Lake of Ohrid. Its climate is profoundly influenced by a seasonal Mediterranean and continental climate. The total municipal population is 46,070, of which 17,371 is in the municipal unit as of the 2023 census.

Pogradec and its surroundings were listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site as part of the natural and cultural heritage of the region of Ohrid. Nevertheless, the Illyrian Royal Tombs in the adjacent unit of Proptisht are on the Albanian tentative list for becoming a World Heritage Site.

== Etymology ==

The name of the town is Eastern South Slavic in origin. Pogradec comes from &quot;Po(d)&quot; (under/beneath) and &quot;Gradec&quot; (town, city, castle or fortified settlement) and means literally &quot;under the city&quot;. This is a reference to the ancient Illyrian settlement, which was situated on a hill above the contemporary region of Pogradec. In the medieval period during the Ottoman occupation, the town was known as İstarova or İstarye during Ottoman rule and was bounded to as kaza center in Görice Sanjak of Manastır Vilayet before Balkan Wars.

== History ==

From the 8th until the 14th century, Pogradec area was captured by various medieval states such as the Bulgarian, Byzantine and Serbian Empires as well as by noble Albanian families such as Gropa. It was most likely during the Bulgarian empires rule in Pogradec is when it gained its modern name. In the middle of 15th century the area became part of the League of Lezhë and after Skanderbeg&#x27;s death in 1468, it was invaded by the Ottomans who kept it until Albania&#x27;s Independence in 1912. During their occupation Pogradec was the center of the kaza of Starova and was developed as a small town of craftsmen and fishermen. When the Turkish traveler Evliya Celebi visited the area in 1662 he wrote that &quot;Pogradec was a sweet city with red roofs, four neighborhoods, four mosques, two elementary schools, six hundred houses and one hundred and fifty shops&quot;.

During the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, Pogradec area played an important role in the Albanian National Renaissance. In 14 March 1887 the second Albanian language school was started here.
During WWI Pogradec became a battlefield divided between the enemy fronts. From 1914 until 1920 Austro-Hungarian, Serbian, Greek, Bulgarian and French armies, captured the city replacing each-other from time to time.

During WWII the city was first invaded by the Italian army in 12 April 1939. Italian occupation of Pogradec was interrupted due to Greco-Italian War and Greek troops occupied the city between 30 November 1940 and 14 April 1941. After Italy&#x27;s capitulation in 1943 it was liberated by the Albanian partisans.

After the war the town was a favorite summer escape for many communist government officials and particularly Enver Hoxha. The summer residences and the area around them were sealed off from the public.

== Geography ==
Pogradec is located at , on the shore of the southwestern corner of the Lake of Ohrid between two mountain chains located in the north and east. The mountain chain of Mali i Thatë in the Prespa National Park rises in the east of the city and divides the region from the Lake of Prespa. Defined in an area of , the municipality of Pogradec is encompassed in the county of Korçë within the Southern Region of Albania and consists of the adjacent administrative units of Buçimas, Çërravë, Dardhas, Proptisht, Trebinjë, Udenisht, Velçan and Pogradec as its seat.

=== Climate ===

The climate of the Lake Ohrid is classified as a local-continental type because of a microclime that is created in that area influenced by Mediterranean climate. The average annual rainfall in the Lake basin amount to approximately 730 mm.
== Economy ==

Pogradec is located about 139 km from Tirana, the capital city of Albania, 40 km from Korça, and 5 km from North Macedonia.
Pogradec is the last railway station: Tirana - Durrës - Elbasan - Librazhd - Pogradec and located along SH3 road that passes through Devoll and continues to Greece.
However, the train service now finishes at Elbasan, and parts of the line from there on are derelict. There are some proposals to revive the line and extend it to connect to the Greek railway network.
Translake transport started on 15 June 2014 with a tourist ferry between Pogradec and Ohrid, but the service is sporadic and unreliable.

== Culture ==

Pogradec is well known for its famous writers and poets such as Lasgush Poradeci and Mitrush Kuteli, and lately Luan Starova. Their works are a crucial part of Albanian literature.

The main characters of Luan Starova&#x27;s cycle of novels, &quot;The Balkan Saga&quot;, are the author&#x27;s own parents and their family, who fled Pogradec for Macedonia during World War II. Separated from their old hometown and their relatives by the Albania-Yugoslavia border during the Enver Hoxha&#x27;s era, they would often look at Pogradec through a binocular from the vantage point of Monastery of Saint Naum on the other side of the lake.

Pogradec is also the home of nationally and internationally acclaimed artist painters like Anastas Kostandini(Taso), Gjergji Lako, Gentian Zeka, Vangjo Vasili, Odhisea Dhima, Ilir Dhima, etc. All kinds of sports are practiced in town, especially by the youth.

Pogradec has a professional football team called KS Pogradeci. There are several varsity soccer teams mainly composed of high school students. Even volleyball and basketball are played competitively. During the summer, beach volleyball draws the attention of all the residents. Many professional volleyball teams from Albania and other Balkan countries participate in a championship which lasts about two weeks. Pogradeci team has been awarded the first prize several times. Other sports to mention are swimming and boxing. The boxing team, &quot;Dragoi&quot;, is one of the top teams in the nation and has always trained champions.

Pogradec also has a rich folklore. Many songs and dances have been created throughout the centuries. Their themes are based on the beauty of the lake and a love for nature.

Some of the main recurring cultural events in the city are:

&quot;Puppet Theater Festival&quot; - Takes place every June. Participants vary from national to European level.

&quot;Lake Day&quot; - Takes place in 21 June. All the towns surrounding lake Ohrid (Pogradec, Ohrid and Struga) gather in a festival where local delicacies, including food and culture are showcased.

<text>Levofloxacin, sold under the brand name Levaquin among others, is a broad-spectrum antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone drug class. It is the left-handed isomer of the medication ofloxacin. It is used to treat a number of bacterial infections including acute bacterial sinusitis, pneumonia, &quot;H. pylori&quot; (in combination with other medications), urinary tract infections, Legionnaires&#x27; disease, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and some types of gastroenteritis. Along with other antibiotics it may be used to treat tuberculosis, meningitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease. It is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form.
Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and trouble sleeping. A warning concerning all fluoroquinolones was issued in 2016: &quot;An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically (i.e. tablets, capsules, and injectable) are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious adverse effects that can occur together. These adverse effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.&quot;

Other serious side effects may include tendon rupture, tendon inflammation, seizures, psychosis, and potentially permanent peripheral nerve damage. Tendon damage may appear months after treatment is completed. People may also sunburn more easily. In people with myasthenia gravis, muscle weakness and breathing problems may worsen. While use during pregnancy is not recommended, risk appears to be low. The use of other medications in this class appear to be safe while breastfeeding; however, the safety of levofloxacin is unclear.
Levofloxacin was patented in 1985 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 251st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Levofloxacin is used to treat infections including: respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, prostatitis, anthrax, endocarditis, meningitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, traveler&#x27;s diarrhea, tuberculosis, and plague and is available by mouth, intravenously, and in eye drop form.

As of 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that &quot;serious side effects associated with fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs generally outweigh the benefits for patients with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections who have other treatment options. For patients with these conditions, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for those who do not have alternative treatment options.&quot;

Levofloxacin is used for the treatment of pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and abdominal infections. As of 2007 the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society recommended levofloxacin and other respiratory fluoroquinolines as first line treatment for community acquired pneumonia when co-morbidities such as heart, lung, or liver disease are present or when in-patient treatment is required. Levofloxacin also plays an important role in recommended treatment regimens for ventilator-associated and healthcare-associated pneumonia.

As of 2010 it was recommended by the IDSA as a first-line treatment option for catheter-associated urinary tract infections in adults. In combination with metronidazole it is recommended as one of several first-line treatment options for adult patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to-moderate severity. The IDSA also recommends it in combination with rifampicin as a first-line treatment for prosthetic joint infections. The American Urological Association recommends levofloxacin as a first-line treatment to prevent bacterial prostatitis when the prostate is biopsied. and as of 2004 it was recommended to treat bacterial prostatitis by the NIH research network studying the condition.

Levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones have also been widely used for the treatment of uncomplicated community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections, indications for which major medical societies generally recommend the use of older, narrower spectrum drugs to avoid fluoroquinolone resistance development. Due to its widespread use, common pathogens such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; have developed resistance. In many countries as of 2013, resistance rates among healthcare-associated infections with these pathogens exceeded 20%.

Levofloxacin is also used as antibiotic eye drops to prevent bacterial infection. Usage of levofloxacin eye drops, along with an antibiotic injection of cefuroxime or penicillin during cataract surgery, has been found to lower the chance of developing endophthalmitis, compared to eye drops or injections alone.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
According to the FDA approved prescribing information, levofloxacin is pregnancy category C. This designation indicates that animal reproduction studies have shown adverse effects on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but the potential benefit to the mother may in some cases outweigh the risk to the fetus. Available data point to a low risk for the unborn child. Exposure to quinolones, including levofloxacin, during the first-trimester is not associated with an increased risk of stillbirths, premature births, birth defects, or low birth weight.

Levofloxacin does penetrate into breastmilk, though the concentration of levofloxacin in the breastfeeding infant is expected to be low. Due to potential risks to the baby, the manufacturer does not recommend that nursing mothers take levofloxacin. However, the risk appears to be very low, and levofloxacin can be used in breastfeeding mothers with proper monitoring of the infant, combined with delaying breastfeeding for 4–6 hours after taking levofloxacin.

===Children===
Levofloxacin is not approved in most countries for the treatment of children except in unique and life-threatening infections because it is associated with an elevated risk of musculoskeletal injury in this population, a property it shares with other fluoroquinolones.

In the United States levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of anthrax and plague in children over six months of age.

Levofloxacin is recommended by the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America as a first-line treatment for pediatric pneumonia caused by penicillin-resistant &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, and as a second-line agent for the treatment of penicillin-sensitive cases.

In one study, 1534 juvenile patients (age 6 months to 16 years) treated with levofloxacin as part of three efficacy trials were followed up to assess all musculoskeletal events occurring up to 12 months post-treatment. At 12 months follow-up the cumulative incidence of musculoskeletal adverse events was 3.4%, compared to 1.8% among 893 patients treated with other antibiotics. In the levafloxacin-treated group, approximately two-thirds of these musculoskeletal adverse events occurred in the first 60 days, 86% were mild, 17% were moderate, and all resolved without long-term sequelae.

===Spectrum of activity===
Levofloxacin and later generation fluoroquinolones are collectively referred to as &quot;respiratory quinolones&quot; to distinguish them from earlier fluoroquinolones which exhibited modest activity toward the important respiratory pathogen &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;.

The drug exhibits enhanced activity against the important respiratory pathogen &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; relative to earlier fluoroquinolone derivatives like ciprofloxacin. For this reason, it is considered a &quot;respiratory fluoroquinolone&quot; along with more recently developed fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. It is less active than ciprofloxacin against Gram-negative bacteria, especially &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, and lacks the anti-methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) activity of moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. Levofloxacin has shown moderate activity against anaerobes, and is about twice as potent as ofloxacin against &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; and other mycobacteria, including &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; complex.

Its spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for respiratory, urinary tract, gastrointestinal, and abdominal infections, including Gram negative (&quot;Escherichia coli&quot;,&quot; Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;, &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot;, and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;), Gram positive (methicillin-sensitive but not methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;, &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;, and &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;), and atypical bacterial pathogens (&quot;Chlamydophila pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;). Compared to earlier antibiotics of the fluoroquinoline class such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin exhibits greater activity towards Gram-positive bacteria but lesser activity toward Gram-negative bacteria, especially &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;.

===Resistance===
Resistance to fluoroquinolones is common in &quot;staphylococcus&quot; and &quot;pseudomonas&quot;. Resistance occurs in multiple ways. One mechanism is by an alteration in topoisomerase IV enzyme. A double mutant form of S. &quot;pneumoniae&quot; Gyr A + Par C bearing Ser-81--&gt;Phe and Ser-79--&gt;Phe mutations were eight to sixteen times less responsive to ciprofloxacin.

==Contraindications and interactions==
Package inserts mention that levofloxacin is to be avoided in patients with a known hypersensitivity to levofloxacin or other quinolone drugs.

Like all fluoroquinolines, levofloxacin is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy or other seizure disorders, and in patients who have a history of quinolone-associated tendon rupture.

Levofloxacin may prolong the QT interval in some people, especially the elderly, and levofloxacin should not be used for people with a family history of Long QT syndrome, or who have long QT, chronic low potassium, it should not be prescribed with other drugs that prolong the QT interval.

Unlike ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin does not appear to deactivate the drug metabolizing enzyme CYP1A2. Therefore, drugs that use that enzyme, like theophylline, do not interact with levofloxacin. It is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, suggesting potential to block the breakdown of warfarin and phenprocoumon. This can result in more action of drugs like warfarin, leading to more potential side effects, such as bleeding.

The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in combination with high dose fluoroquinolone therapy may lead to seizures.

When levofloxacin is taken with anti-acids containing magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide, the two combine to form insoluble salts that are difficult to absorb from the intestines. Peak serum concentrations of levofloxacin may be reduced by 90% or more, which can prevent the levofloxacin from working. Similar results have been reported when levofloxacin is taken with iron supplements and multi-vitamins containing zinc.

A 2011 review examining musculoskeletal complications of fluoroquinolones proposed guidelines with respect to administration to athletes, that called for avoiding all use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics if possible, and if they are used: ensure there is informed consent about the musculoskeletal risks, and inform coaching staff; do not use any corticosteroids if fluoroquinolones are used; consider dietary supplements of magnesium and antioxidants during treatment; reduce training until the course of antibiotic is finished and then carefully increase back to normal; and monitor for six months after the course is finished, and stop all athletic activity if symptoms emerge.

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects are typically mild to moderate. However, severe, disabling, and potentially irreversible adverse effects sometimes occur, and for this reason it is recommended that use of fluoroquinolones be limited.

Prominent among these are adverse effects that became the subject of a black box warning by the FDA in 2016. The FDA wrote: &quot;An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically (i.e. tablets, capsules, and injectable) are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious adverse effects that can occur together. These adverse effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.&quot; Rarely, tendinitis or tendon rupture may occur due to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, including levofloxacin. Such injuries, including tendon rupture, has been observed up to six months after cessation of treatment; higher doses of fluoroquinolones, being elderly, transplant patients, and those with a current or historical corticosteroid use are at elevated risk. The U.S. label for levofloxacin also contains a black box warning for the exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disease myasthenia gravis. Similarly, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency recommendations warn of rare but disabling and potentially irreversible adverse effects, and to recommend limiting use of these drugs. Increasing age and corticosteroid use appears to increase the risk of musculoskeletal complications.

A wide variety of other uncommon but serious adverse events have been associated with fluoroquinolone use, with varying degrees of evidence supporting causation. These include anaphylaxis, hepatotoxicity, central nervous system effects including seizures and psychiatric effects, prolongation of the QT interval, blood glucose disturbances, and photosensitivity, among others. Levofloxacin may produce fewer of these rare serious adverse effects than other fluoroquinolones.

There is some disagreement in the medical literature regarding whether and to what extent levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones produce serious adverse effects more frequently than other broad spectrum antibacterial drugs.

Concerning more usual adverse effects, in pooled results from 7537 patients exposed to levofloxacin in 29 clinical trials, 4.3% discontinued treatment due to adverse drug reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were gastrointestinal, including nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Overall, 7% of patients experienced nausea, 6% headache, 5% diarrhea, and 4% insomnia, along with other adverse reactions experienced at lower rates.

Administration of levofloxacin or other broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; associated diarrhea which may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Fluoroquinolone administration may be associated with the acquisition and outgrowth of a particularly virulent &quot;Clostridioides&quot; strain.

More research is needed to determine the best dose and length of treatment.

==Overdose==
Overdosing experiments in animals showed loss of body control and drooping, difficulty breathing, tremors, and convulsions. Doses in excess of 1500 mg/kg orally and 250 mg/kg IV produced significant mortality in rodents.

In the event of an acute overdosage, authorities recommend unspecific standard procedures such as emptying the stomach, observing the patient and maintaining appropriate hydration. Levofloxacin is not efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanism of action===
Levofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Like all quinolones, it functions by inhibiting the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, two bacterial type IIA topoisomerases. Topoisomerase IV is necessary to separate DNA that has been replicated (doubled) prior to bacterial cell division. With the DNA not being separated, the process is stopped, and the bacterium cannot divide. DNA gyrase, on the other hand, is responsible for supercoiling the DNA, so that it will fit in the newly formed cells. Both mechanisms amount to killing the bacterium. Levofloxacin acts as a bactericide.

As of 2011, the mechanism of action for the drug&#x27;s musculoskeletal complications were not clear.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Levofloxacin is rapidly and essentially completely absorbed after oral administration, with a plasma concentration profile over time that is essentially identical to that obtained from intravenous administration of the same amount over 60 minutes. As such, the intravenous and oral formulations of levofloxacin are considered interchangeable. Levofloxacin&#x27;s ability to bind to proteins in the body ranges from 24 to 38%.

The drug undergoes widespread distribution into body tissues. Peak levels in skin are achieved 3 hours after administration and exceed those in plasma by a factor of 2. Similarly, lung tissue concentrations range from two-fold to five-fold higher than plasma concentrations in the 24 hours after a single dose.

The mean terminal plasma elimination half-life of levofloxacin ranges from approximately 6 to 8 hours following single or multiple doses of levofloxacin given orally or intravenously. Elimination occurs mainly via excretion of unmetabolized drug in the urine. Following oral administration, 87% of an administered dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged drug within 2 days. Less than 5% was recovered in the urine as the desmethyl and N-oxide metabolites, the only metabolites identified in humans.

==Chemistry==
Like all fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin is a fluorinated quinolone carboxylic acid. It is a chiral molecule and the pure (−)-(&quot;S&quot;)-enantiomer of the racemic drug ofloxacin. This enantiomer binds more effectively to the DNA gyrase enzyme and to topoisomerase IV than its (+)-(&quot;R&quot;)-counterpart. Levofloxacin is referred to as a chiral switch: These are chiral drugs that have already been patent claimed, approved and marketed as racemates (or as mixtures of diastereomers but have since been redeveloped as pure enantiomers. Distinct functional groups on this molecules include a hydroxyl group, carbonyl group, and an aromatic ring.

The substance is used as the hemihydrate, which has the empirical formula C18H20FN3O4 · H2O and a molecular mass of 370.38 g/mol. Levofloxacin is a light-yellowish-white to yellow-white crystal or crystalline powder. A major issue in the synthesis of levofloxacin is identifying correct entries into the benzoxazine core in order to produce the correct chiral form.

==History==
Levofloxacin is a third-generation fluoroquinolone, being one of the isomers of ofloxacin, which was a broader-spectrum conformationally locked analog of norfloxacin; both ofloxacin and levofloxaxin were synthesized and developed by scientists at Daiichi Seiyaku. The Daiichi scientists knew that ofloxacin was racemic, but tried unsuccessfully to separate the two isomers; in 1985 they succeeded in separately synthesizing the pure levo form and showed that it was less toxic and more potent than the other form.

It was first approved for marketing in Japan in 1993, for oral administration, and Daiichi marketed it there under the brand name Cravit. Daiichi, working with Johnson &amp; Johnson as it had with ofloxacin, obtained FDA approval in 1996 under the brand name Levaquin to treat bacterial sinusitus, bacterial exacerbations of bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia, uncomplicated skin infections, complicated urinary tract infections, and acute pyelonephritis.

==Society and culture==
=== Economics ===
Levofloxacin had reached blockbuster status by this time; combined worldwide sales of levofloxacin and ofloxacin for J&amp;J alone were in 2009.

The term of the levofloxacin United States patent was extended by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 810 days under the provisions of the Hatch Waxman Amendment so that the patent would expire in 2010 instead of 2008. This extension was challenged by generic drug manufacturer Lupin Pharmaceuticals, which did not challenge the validity of the patent, but only the validity of the patent extension, arguing that the patent did not cover a &quot;product&quot; and so Hatch-Waxman was not available for extensions. The federal patent court ruled in favor of J&amp;J and Daiichi, and generic versions of levofloxacin did not enter the U.S. market until 2009.

===Availability===

Levofloxacin is available in tablet form, injection,patches and oral solution.

===Usage===
The US Food and Drug Administration estimated that in 2011, over 23 million outpatient prescriptions for fluoroquinolones, of which levofloxacin made up 28%, were filled in the United States.

===Litigation===

As of 2012, Johnson and Johnson was facing around 3400 state and federal lawsuits filed by people who claimed tendon damage from levofloxacin; about 1900 pending in a class action at the United States District Court in Minnesota and about 1500 pending at a district court in New Jersey.

In October 2012, J&amp;J settled 845 cases in the Minnesota action, after Johnson and Johnson prevailed in three of the first four cases to go to trial. By May 2014, all but 363 cases had been settled or adjudicated.

=== Brand names ===
Levofloxacin is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis under a license agreement signed with Daiichi in 1993, under the brand name Tavanic.

<text>The Bay of Kiel or Kiel Bay (, ; ) is a bay in the southwestern Baltic Sea, off the shores of Schleswig-Holstein in Germany and the islands of Denmark. It is connected with the Bay of Mecklenburg in the east, the Little Belt in the northwest, and the Great Belt in the North.

Maritime traffic entering or leaving the Baltic through the two Belts must enter the bay. Once in, through traffic to the Baltic passes through another strait, the Fehmarn Belt, into the Bay of Mecklenburg, which opens out into the Baltic Sea. In the other direction, traffic can either pass northward through the Great Belt, keeping Langeland on the port side, or enter the Kiel Fjord and traverse the Kiel Canal directly to the mouth of the Elbe River and the North Sea. The Kiel Fjord ends at Kiel, the capital of Schleswig-Holstein.

==Geography==
The southwest shore of the bay is the coast of Schleswig-Holstein. From the latter drains the Schlei inlet, actually a brackish estuary, at the head of which is the city named after it, Schleswig. In that coast also are two other smaller bays: the Eckernförde Bay and the Flensburg Fjord. In the north are the Danish islands of Als, Ærø, and Langeland.

===Kieler Förde===
Kieler Förde, projecting from the bay to the south, is about 17 km long and 1 km wide at its narrowest point. The strategic location was not lost on the founders of Holstein, of which Kiel was intended to be a major city. It became a prolific shipyard, which made it a prime target of allied bombing in World War II. Before the foundation of Kiel in 1242 and the construction of a walled city there, the region could not have escaped settlement, especially by the Vikings. Any archaeological trace of them, however, either lies under the city or was disturbed long ago.

===Eckernförde Bay===
Eckernförde Bay is about 16 km long and turns at the mouth, with the south bank on approximately ten km of the Bay of Kiel. The border with Kiel Fjord is at Bülker lighthouse. The once forested peninsula between Kiel Fjord and Eckernförde Bay formed the borderland between the Saxons and the Danes in the Middle Ages. It was termed the Danish Wold. North of Eckernförde Bay is the Schwansen region; at the end of the bay is the city of Eckernförde. The bay itself hosted the sailing events for the 1936 Summer Olympics mainly held in Berlin.

===Schlei===
The 42-km Schlei forms the border between the historical regions Angeln and Schwansen. This part of the bay hosted the sailing competitions for the 1972 Summer Olympics held in mainly held Munich, Bavaria.

===Flensburg Fjord===
Flensburg Fjord is approximately 50 km long. It forms part of the border between Germany and Denmark and marks north border of Angeln.

<text>The NCAA Division III women&#x27;s basketball championship is the annual tournament organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to determine the national champions of women&#x27;s collegiate basketball among its Division III members in the United States. It has been held every year since 1982 (when the NCAA began to sponsor women&#x27;s sports at all three levels), except for 2020 or 2021 due to COVID-19.

Washington St. Louis has been the most successful program, with five national titles. 

The most recent champions are NYU, who won their second national title in 2024.

==History==
=== 1982 Final Four ===
Held in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, the 1982 Women&#x27;s Final Four Basketball Tournament was the first sponsored by the NCAA. Featuring host Elizabethtown College, Clark University (Massachusetts), Pomona College and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, the tournament was played in a classic field house over a three-day period. In the first game of the National Semi-Final Elizabethtown took control right from the tip-off against Clark and easily cruised to a 71–51 victory. In the second game of the Final Four Pomona took the lead early in the game, but UNC Greensboro battled back to tie the game at 56 with six minutes to play. UNC Greensboro then went on a run and pulled away for a 77–66 win. Elizabethtown and UNC Greensboro turned the championship game into an epic battle of lead changes and shifts in momentum. Last second heroics by UNC Greensboro sent the game into overtime, but Elizabethtown came up with the final stop in overtime to win 67–66 in overtime. Television coverage was provided by a fledgling ESPN while exclusive radio coverage was provided by KSPC Radio - Pomona College&#x27;s tiny KSPC sports broadcasting group with Geoff Willis (Pomona &#x27;83) and James Timmerman (Pomona &#x27;82) providing the play by play and color. ESPN was so embryonic that the game was broadcast multiple times during the following two weeks and ESPN hired the KSPC Radio staff to help with background and color research about the players and the teams.

<doc id="538066" wikidata="Q323934" url="?curid=538066" title="Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)">
<text>Leonardo, commonly nicknamed Leo, is a superhero appearing in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comics and related media, and created by American comic book artists Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. He is one of the four central characters of the franchise, along with his brothers, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo. Leonardo is often depicted as the leader and strategist of the turtles.

Often shown wearing an ocean blue bandana, his signature weapons are a pair of swords (named katanas in many versions of the series). He is traditionally portrayed as the most mature and disciplined of the Turtles, displaying a stoic demeanor and a strong sense of responsibility. Like his brothers, he is named after an Italian Renaissance artist, in this case Leonardo da Vinci. In the original comics, all four of the Turtles wear red masks, but for the creators to tell them apart, he was written and redrawn to have an ocean-blue mask.

==Comics==
===Mirage===
Leo is the protagonist of the comics. He does not explicitly refer to himself as a leader in the early stories, except in issue #44 (&quot;The Violent Underground&quot;). He is the one to usually take charge of the turtles when Splinter is not present. He is often at odds with his more hot-headed brother Raphael.

In &quot;Leonardo&quot; #1 (What Goes Around... ...Comes Around!), Leo goes out for a run on the rooftops of New York City and is ambushed by the Foot Clan. He puts up an fight against an army of Foot Ninja but is overwhelmed. Beaten to near unconsciousness, he is thrown through April O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s apartment window. The remaining Turtles and Splinter are forced to continue the fight, but even with the aid of Casey Jones, the odds are against them. In the end, the building catches fire and the police arrive, but they secretly escape to Northampton, Massachusetts. Leonardo recovers from his physical wounds, but he lost his confidence. He repeatedly attempts unsuccessfully to hunt for deer. While out hunting, he sees April fall through ice into a lake, and he rescues her. In subsequent issues, it is implied that Leonardo has regained most of his confidence.

In the &quot;Return to New York&quot; storyline (&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (vol. 1) #19-21), Raphael demands that the Turtles return to New York to confront the Foot Clan and the Shredder. He accuses Leonardo of cowardice, and the arguing brothers fight. Leonardo is beaten by Raphael, who throws Leonardo through the wall of the barn and leaves. Along with his younger brother Donatello and his youngest brother Michelangelo, Leonardo returns to New York and reunites with his wayward brother in the old sewer lair. The three go along with Raphael&#x27;s plan to storm the Foot Headquarters, where once again Raphael goes off on his own to fight the Shredder. He is ambushed and beaten by the Shredder&#x27;s Elite guard but is rescued by Leonardo. This prompts Raphael to cede to Leonardo&#x27;s leadership, leaving him to fight the Shredder. Leonardo engages in a bloody battle with Shredder that ends up on the rooftop of the building. Leonardo ends the battle by decapitating the Shredder just as the building implodes. The Turtles later burn the Shredder&#x27;s corpse on a funeral pyre in a nearby Manhattan harbor.
In the &quot;City at War&quot; storyline (&quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (vol. 1) #50-62), a feud between various factions of the Foot Clan over leadership breaks out. As fighting ensues in the streets of New York, the Turtles and the civilian populace get caught in the middle. Leonardo grows weary of constant battle with the Foot Clan and seems fraught with indecision. The Turtles are approached by Karai, the leader of the Foot Clan in Japan who has come to New York to unite the Foot. She presents the Turtles with an offer of a truce between the Foot and the Turtles if they help her kill Shredder&#x27;s Elite Guards, which are a major obstacle to her reorganizing the Foot. Despite Raphael&#x27;s objections, Leonardo persuades his brothers to accept Karai&#x27;s offer and all four Turtles successfully work with Karai to eliminate the Elite Guard.

In Volume 2 of the Mirage Studios comic, the turtles begin living in separate places. Leonardo decides to live in a newfound sewer lair. Michelangelo and Raphael notice a change in Leonardo and note that he seems more easygoing, though Raphael points out that his and Leonardo&#x27;s natural order is to be &quot;buttin&#x27; heads.&quot;

Years later in Volume 4, Leonardo still leads his brothers (all four now in their thirties) in fights against crime. Leonardo and Raphael&#x27;s conflict seems to have lessened. When the Utroms arrive on Earth and reveal alien life to humans the Turtles become free to mingle in everyday society. The Turtles help the Utroms acclimate to life on Earth and work alongside the Foot Clan as security. One Foot Clan member is Cha Ocho, who Leonardo has a rivalry with due to an encounter years earlier. Karai approaches Leonardo for help when a mysterious force begins attacking various Foot Clans; only the New York branch is left intact. His investigation takes him to the Battle Nexus, where he meets Oroku Yoshi (who wears armor similar to the Shredder&#x27;s).

This incarnation of Leonardo makes an appearance in the &quot;Turtles Forever&quot; crossover special voiced by Jason Griffith.

===Image Comics===
In Volume 3 of the Image Comics series, Leonardo was initially portrayed as similar to his Mirage counterpart (at the time, Image was picking up where Volume 2 left off). In the later issues, he lost a hand when it was eaten by King Komodo, although this did not seem to deter him. He tried to use a prosthetic hand, which was given to him by Donatello, but he preferred to wear a steel cap which came with a retractable blade. In the IDW-published conclusion, &quot;TMNT Urban Legends 25&quot;, after an altercation with Lady Shredder which smashed his steel cap beyond use, Leonardo&#x27;s hand was found to have grown back.

===Archie Comics===
The Archie Comics series initially began as an adaptation of the 1987 animated series, so Leonardo was portrayed like his animated counterpart. As the series progressed, it began telling original stories. Leonardo demonstrated a dislike for firearms. A future version of Leonardo was depicted, having founded a ninja school. Four of his top students were depicted: Nobuko, possibly his love interest; Miles, a young black man; Carmen, a Latina woman and possibly his love interest; and Bob, an anthropomorphic baboon. These students seemed to have an &quot;extended family&quot; relationship with the Turtles, Bob, in particular, referring to them as uncles.

===IDW Comics===
Although the IDW series is a re-imagination of the franchise, Leonardo is initially portrayed as similar to his Mirage counterpart. Leonardo is the eldest brother and the leader of the four. In the &quot;Cityfall&quot; saga, he gets captured by the Foot while he and his brothers try to save Casey and is taken to a Shinto witch by the name of Kitsune, who uses her dark magic to brainwash him into working for Shredder as his chunin (second-in-command), which infuriates Karai. He is saved by his brothers and their allies, however, after the death of the Shredder at the hands of his father, Splinter, who took over the Foot Clan after the battle, Leo once again became the chunin, but, like last time, it did not last. The relationship between Splinter and his sons deteriorated after he decided to take another life, going against the philosophy he taught them to always follow. He revealed that this was, in fact, an intentional way of pushing them away from him, as he believes being around him would be too much of a threat to them, as shown during the events of the comic book. Leonardo assumed leadership over the Clan Hamato, and since then, they have come into conflict with the Foot Clan several times.

==Television==
===1987 animated series===
In the lyrics for the 1987 TV series&#x27; theme song, Leonardo is stated to be the leader of the turtles; his orders are usually followed, and he is a serious do-gooder who does not joke around. He was attracted to a young kunoichi named Lotus, a swordswoman prodigy from Japan who was hired by Krang to replace Shredder, whom she defeated (along with Rocksteady and Bebop). She and Leonardo dueled to a standstill before she resorted to a trick sword to knock him out. When they met the second time, she tried to convince him to join her as a &quot;ninja for hire&quot;, but he refused. She turned on Krang and escaped to continue her mercenary lifestyle, telling Leonardo that there was little good in goodness, though she hoped that they would one day be on the same side.

Leonardo takes his role of being a leader seriously. He can be bossy which annoys his brothers. Mostly they will obey, but sometimes they will not. In a Season 4 episode &quot;Leonardo lightens up&quot;, his brothers got so annoyed that they used a personality alternator to make him loosen up, which lead to huge problems but ended up going back to normal in the end.

When the cartoon series starts out, he is shown with having a level head, akin to his leadership qualities in the comic. However, as the series carried on, he became more of a hero of a group of superheroes and spoke in a high pitched voice, which was very different from the original, deeper pitch in the first season.

Leonardo seems to enjoy reading. For example, many times when the Turtles are at home, Leo is reading a book. In the episode &quot;Four Musketurtles&quot;, he is the only Turtle that read &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. Another good example is in &quot;Leonardo is Missing&quot;; while the other Turtles go to an arcade, Leonardo stays at the lair and reads. In the Season 6 episode &quot;Snakes Alive&quot;, it is revealed that Leonardo has Ophidiophobia, but confronted it later.

In the Season 3 episode &quot;Take Me to Your Leader!&quot;, Leonardo gives up his leadership and walks away after a dream he believes convinces him he is no longer a good leader. The others have to find him, and stop Shredder, Krang, and Bebop and Rocksteady from draining energy from the Sun with a Solar Siphon and store it in solar batteries. However, Leonardo returns when he spots a bridge collapsing due to snow. After a man says that everybody talks about the weather but nobody does anything, Leonardo realizes his responsibility and begins to search for his brothers. He later finds them, and together they save the Earth.

Leonardo&#x27;s voice actor was Cam Clarke. This role was the actor&#x27;s &quot;breakout role&quot;, and is still one of his best-known roles in the 1987 cartoon. In the crossover film &quot;Turtles Forever&quot;, this version of Leonardo is voiced by Dan Green. Leonardo made a couple of appearances in the 2012 series in the episode, &quot;The Manhattan Project&quot;. He and the other turtles along with Casey and April are seen through a portal by their 2012 counterparts walking on a road and he made a speaking cameo along with the other turtles at the end of the episode when a space worm from the 2012 dimension started terrorizing the street. All four turtles see the worm and spring into action while shouting their famous catchphrase, &#x27;Cowabunga&#x27;. Clarke reprised his role as Leonardo for the cameo. This would mark the first time in over 28 years the 1987 TMNT cast would return to their roles, with the sole exception of Rob Paulsen who returned to the TMNT franchise as Donatello in the 2012 series. The 1987 turtles then had a crossover with the 2012 turtles in the season 4 episode, &quot;Trans-Dimensional Turtles&quot; then in the three-part series final &quot;Wanted: Bebop &amp; Rocksteady&quot;.

===Coming Out of Their Shells tour===
The live-action &quot;Coming Out of Their Shells&quot; concert tour kickoff event at Radio City Music Hall would see Leonardo cast as the band&#x27;s bass player, taking a secondary role while Michelangelo would take the role of lead singer and guitarist. However, once the Turtles are confronted by the Shredder and his forces during portions of the show, Leonardo again takes his role as the Turtles&#x27; battlefield commander, as they begin to defer to his orders during the various fight scenes in the show.

===1997 live-action series===
From 1997 to 1998, Leonardo along with the other Ninja Turtles was featured in a short-lived live-action series &quot;Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation&quot;, as well as a crossover episode with &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot;. In it, he carried one double-bladed ninjaken instead of two and his sibling rivalry with Raphael drove many episodes. In one episode where they were sparring, Raphael took advantage of Leo&#x27;s apparent physical weakening, insulting, mocking and taunting his brother to make him more reckless, until finally, Leo lost his temper and angrily kicked Raph so hard that he sent Raph flying across the sewer den. They spent the rest of the episode arguing and challenging each other to tests of skill (some of them quite absurd) until finally using arm wrestling to decide who would live in the sewer and who would leave. Although Leo won, it was decided that Raph should stay. In this series, Leonardo was portrayed by Gabe Khouth and voiced by Michael Dobson.

===2003 animated series===

In the Mirage Studios and 4Kids Entertainment 2003 animated TV series, Leonardo is voiced by Michael Sinterniklaas.

Leonardo is the eldest brother, and leader of the group, quiet and the most serious of the four. He has a very close bond with Splinter, and has a strong sense of honor, ethics, and Bushidō. Leonardo&#x27;s twin swords are slung across his back. Episodes that deal with the Shredder and honor usually also focus on Leonardo, and he is often the Turtle who &quot;saves the day&quot;. Leonardo is a more self-doubting character than in previous incarnations. His brother Raphael often quarrels with him and resents his leadership, sarcastically calling Leonardo &quot;Fearless Leader&quot;, although the two are shown to be very close at times. Though Leonardo&#x27;s relationships with his younger brothers Donatello and Michelangelo are not as volatile, both have made comments alluding to the high standards the former has set, and his tendency to make them look bad. Despite this, his brothers view him as a pillar of strength and are at a loss when he is injured or absent. One of Leonardo&#x27;s most prominent qualities is his determination to believe in the good and the best in people, even potential enemies; such as Karai.

At times, Leonardo is shown to be very hard on himself, as he feels that a lot is expected of him. As in the Mirage comics, Leonardo is ambushed and seriously injured by the Foot Clan and he feels he let his family and himself down. He has the same feelings after the final battle with the Shredder-his anger and self-doubt were caused by Karai, who he believed was an honorable ally, but she was unable to go against her master&#x27;s orders, eventually causing her to stab Leonardo (albeit unintentionally). Leonardo also feels extremely inadequate, as he believes that again, he let himself and his family down, this time by finding no other way to destroy the Shredder than to blow up the spaceship that both the Turtles and the Shredder were on; the Turtles and Splinter would have perished if they had not been rescued by Utroms. Because of what happen in the last battle against the Shredder, Leo becomes bitter and increasingly stern with himself and adopts a greatly aggressive personality, which has been likened to Raph&#x27;s previous impulsive and hotheaded ways on many occasions. Leonardo also shows considerably less reluctance in using violence to interrogate people, and devotes himself to even greater lengths of training in order to protect his family.

Not wanting to worry his family, Leonardo decided to not tell them about his true feelings about their final battle against the Shredder, although he open up to April and Usagi about his problems. However, Leonardo ended up making his family concern for him anyway and they didn&#x27;t like his attitude. Eventually, Leonardo finds inner peace under the guidance of the Ancient One, who trained Splinter&#x27;s sensei, Hamato Yoshi. From their final battle with the Shredder, Leonardo was the only Turtle to sustain truly lasting damage; part of the shell on his upper left shoulder had its edge shorn. Nevertheless, he is the most skilled of the Turtles, being the only one trained by two ninja masters, capable of facing and defeating Karai, the new Shredder, in a one-on-one fight, as well as defeating all three of his brothers at once in a sparring match.

In the fifth season, of the eight acolytes under the Tribunal&#x27;s training, Leonardo is the only one who does not receive a weapon from the Spirit Forge. It is implied that his spirit is his weapon, and anything he holds is merely an extension. (This was hinted at in previous seasons.) His otherworldly form is that of a dragon, a rare form, unheard of in someone his age. It is shown destroying evil guarding the second artifact. This avatar is first shown in &quot;More Worlds Than One&quot;. His brothers later exhibit dragon avatars as well. In the fifth episode &quot;Beginning of the End&quot;, he is given the sword &quot;Gunjin&quot; (one of the Fangs of the Dragon that commands the &quot;White Flame of the Dragon King&quot;) by the wounded Faraji, who believes the sword was meant to be Leo&#x27;s. Leo returns Gunjin in episode 12 &quot;Enter the Dragons&quot; when Faraji returns to help battle the Tengu Shredder because he believes the sword truly belongs to Faraji.

In the Fast Forward season and the Back to the Sewers season, the damage that occurred to Leonardo&#x27;s shell as stated above has somehow been repaired.

Leonardo is trained not just by Master Splinter but the Ancient One himself, Hamato Yoshi&#x27;s trainer and adoptive father. From then on, Leonardo is far more experienced and skillful at even more complex ninjitsu moves than even Splinter, Raph, Mikey, and Donnie all at once. In the third part of the first season episode series &quot;Return to New York&quot;, he cuts the Shredder&#x27;s head off in a one-on one-duel in Shredder&#x27;s domain.

Leonardo is the most skilled at ninjutsu and other forms of hand-to-hand combat he all learned from his adopted father and master, Splinter. As his weapons are dual katanas, he is proficient in &quot;the ways of the sword&quot; and basic knife-throwing techniques. If need be, he can use Qi Qong to slow his own bodily functions to survive temporarily without oxygen. After training sessions with &quot;the Ancient One&quot; he developed an intuitive/psionic-like ability to see what has previously transpired by &quot;allowing thought to flow out and within.&quot;

===2012 animated series===
Leonardo again leads the team in Nickelodeon&#x27;s animated series. In this latest version, Leonardo seems to be less experienced and still perfecting his fighting skills and leadership abilities to make more solid decisions and gain more trust from his three brothers. He regularly watches an animated science fiction show called &quot;Space Heroes&quot; (a parody of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;) and uses it as a guide for his leadership skills, often attempting to quote from the show in an attempt to sound intimidating and heroic, even if most of his attempts fall flat due to him sounding too cliché.

Leonardo&#x27;s weapons here are purely dual katanas, which he uses in the Niten Ryu style of kenjutsu, making him an excellent swordsman. Despite the fact the other three turtles have added traits in this series, Leonardo is almost completely normal but now has blue eyes. 
Upon the sudden demise of his adopted father and master, he reluctantly steps up as sensei in addition to being the leader, which puts even more pressure on him. He is visited, on occasion, by the spirit of Splinter who encourages him to lead his family and friends to stop new evils.

In addition to his natural ninjitsu skills, he eventually developed the strong innate ability to heal via an enchanted mantra known as &quot;the healing hands&quot;. By chanting the incantation and making the right hand seals, Leo is fully capable of revitalizing his inner strength and counteracting even the most lethal of poisons and venom of &quot;the healing hands&quot;. He managed to develop and utilize it to counteract the lethal venom of Karai, and attempted to use it on her to release her from the Shredder&#x27;s control but failed. He then succeeded in saving Casey and Michelangelo from death. According to Splinter, he shows great gifts as a healer, and that being at the edge of his life had given him &quot;a power that few martial artists can tap.&quot;

The character was voiced by actor Jason Biggs up until &quot;The Wrath of Tiger Claw&quot;. Biggs then departed the series and was replaced by Dominic Catrambone for the remainder of the second season; Seth Green then took on the role for the remainder of the series, this change in voice was explained in the series as a throat injury sustained in the season 2 finale.

===2018 animated series===

In the 2018 animated series, &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, &quot;Leonardo, the self-professed &quot;coolest&quot; brother possesses irreverent charm and a rebel heart&quot;. Unlike past versions, he is not the official leader of the turtles until the second season finale, and boasts a less serious, more laidback, charming, sardonic, and joke-cracking personality. This incarnation of Leo is the second born brother, with Raphael being the oldest. Despite his apparent immaturity and goofiness, Leo is quick-witted and strategic by nature. He initiatively leads his brothers whenever something has happened to Raphael, who is the group&#x27;s de facto leader throughout the first two seasons. Despite coming off as somewhat arrogant, he also demonstrates insecurity and self-doubt. At the end of the season 2 finale &quot;Rise&quot;, Splinter appoints Leo the new leader of his sons, much to the shock of him and his brothers. He is voiced by Ben Schwartz.

In &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie&quot;, Leo ends up doing more harm than good when his ego causes an alien race called the Krang to invade and Raphael to be captured. But over the course of the film Leo becomes more adept at fulfilling the role of leader. He sacrifices himself by trapping both himself and the Krang in the prison dimension to save the world (and possibly to make-up for all the harm he’s done), being content knowing that his family was safe from a future where the Krang decimate the planet. He is saved from the prison dimension at the end of the film thanks to Mikey&#x27;s new mystic powers and Leo reconciles with Raphael.

===&quot;Tales of the TMNT&quot; (2024)===
Leo appears in &quot;Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, a follow-up 2d-animated series sequel to &quot;TMNT: Mutant Mayhem&quot;, with Nicolas Cantu reprising his role from the latter film.

==Films==
===Original trilogy===
In &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, Leonardo was fairly modest and sensitive, rarely issuing direct commands and seemingly much more relaxed around his brothers thinking of himself as more of an equal than a leader. It was he who first communicated telepathically with a kidnapped Splinter and seems the most anxious about Raphael&#x27;s health after his ambush by the Foot Clan. He fought alongside his brothers against The Shredder in the climactic battle and was the only one of the four to actually injure The Shredder, but, like his brothers, could not defeat him. Due to the focus on Raphael in the film&#x27;s plot, Leonardo&#x27;s personality was rarely explored and his leadership position in the team took a back seat. Leonardo was portrayed by David Forman and voiced by Brian Tochi.

In &quot;The Secret of the Ooze&quot;, Leonardo was much more prominent and his leadership position was brought to focus. He is seen on many occasions bickering with Raphael as their sibling rivalry begins to become much more serious. He, like his brothers, was astonished at the return of the Foot but he found that their current homelessness due to their last battle was a more pressing issue and soon he convinced his brothers that they needed to move. Leonardo is once again sensitive, caring, and humorous in this adaption but he now appears much bossier and controlling. This time, Leonardo was portrayed by Mark Caso and once again voiced by Brian Tochi

In &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot;, after traveling back in time to feudal Japan, Leonardo leads his brothers to help a village in trouble from the villainous weapons trader, Walker, and to return home. In the last of the original film&#x27;s trilogy, Leonardo was once again portrayed by Mark Caso and voiced by Brian Tochi

===2007 film===
In &quot;TMNT&quot;, Leo was sent away by Master Splinter to hone his skills in becoming a more efficient leader after Shredder&#x27;s defeat. April finds him in Central America and while he was hesitant to return to New York City, he does at the right time to take on a new force of evil.

His brotherly relationship with Raphael is strained due to Raphael feeling abandoned by Leo as well as feeling less appreciated by Splinter. Leonardo&#x27;s vision of the world is perhaps wider than Raph&#x27;s. In the first movie prequel comic, Leo becomes angry with Raph for trying to leave them in order to save a man from being mugged because 4 heavily armed Triceratons in the sewers could cause devastation to the city. He becomes further angered when Raphael deserts them mid-battle to help an old man. This conflict suggests that the two brothers operate on different levels of morality, though neither is necessarily wrong. Raph states in the comic that he was tired of waiting for disaster to fall on his family and tired of fighting aliens while people in their own neighborhood are being mugged and murdered. Leo, on the other hand, believes that the world of men is the responsibility of the police, while Utroms and Triceratons are their domain... that they should fight only when there is no one else to solve the problem. This also engages Leo in a contradiction when he stays in Central America, using violence to fight local lawlessness and effectively deserting his brothers because he believes as Raph believes, that others need him more. Such parallels suggest that the two brothers are experiencing the same dedication to justice but in a different mentality, albeit in very different locales and using different tactics. In fact, when Leo tracks down and scolds the Nightwatcher (not knowing that he is Raphael), he remarks that he is well aware of the Nightwatcher&#x27;s good intentions but cannot simply approve of the latter&#x27;s methods.

Raph challenges Leonardo after arguing about their own individual sense of justice and the reasons for their actions. Leonardo discovers that Raphael is the Nightwatcher and the two engage in an emotional fight. Raph almost kills Leo out of anger and then retreats due to shame and his brother&#x27;s deep and confused stare. Leo is captured by the Stone Generals and the Foot Clan but is rescued by his family later before the final battle where Leo and Raph finally resolve their differences, Raph accepting Leo as their leader while Leo confesses to needing Raph. Leo is voiced by James Arnold Taylor in this film.

===Reboot series===
Leonardo appears in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, portrayed by Pete Ploszek in motion capture and voiced by Johnny Knoxville. In this movie, he is dedicated to perfecting his ninjutsu skills and will stop at nothing to defend his brothers and the entire city. There are times when his cautious nature makes him clash with his brothers. Leonardo firmly believes it&#x27;s his ninja duty to protect all people. He tends to have a similar personality to his other counterparts where he is determined to help people and keep his brothers in line. He and Raphael, unlike in their other adaptions, do fight over leadership although they have a brief argument over the Hamatshi and Raphael talking about leaving which Leo debunks Raph&#x27;s claim. In the movie, he, like Donnie and Raph, does not seek April&#x27;s attention, unlike Mikey who does. He also appears in the sequel, &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot;, although Knoxville didn&#x27;t return to voice him, and Ploszek provided both motion-capture and voice.

===DC crossover film===
Leonardo appears in the direct-to-video crossover film &quot;Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, voiced by Eric Bauza.

=== &quot;Mutant Mayhem&quot; ===
Leonardo appears in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot;, the first animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film since &quot;TMNT (2007)&quot;, voiced by real teenager Nicolas Cantu. He is characterized as trying hard to be seen as serious, only for the others to mock him, making him feel slightly insecure about himself. Over the course the movie, he eventually comes into his own and starts to act more leader-like. He is also portrayed as having a crush on April O&#x27;Neil and is the first to suggest helping her, upon seeing her for the first time.

==Video games==

In the video games, Leonardo is portrayed as well-balanced, having strong but not extreme abilities in all areas and no glaring weaknesses. His range is rather long, but not as long as Donatello&#x27;s; however, Leonardo can usually inflict more damage. In the &quot;Tournament Fighters&quot; games, his moves are the closest to a Ryu/Ken archetype from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; franchise. He appears in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up&quot; as a playable character, with Michael Sinterniklaas reprising the role.

Leonardo is one of the main playable characters in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot; video game, where he is voiced by Scott Whyte. Leonardo also appears in the 2014 film-based game, played by his original voice actor, Cam Clarke.

Leonardo is featured as one of the playable characters from &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; as DLC in &quot;Injustice 2&quot;, voiced by Corey Krueger. He is the default turtle outside the gear loadout, while the rest of his brothers, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello can only be picked through the said loadout selection, similar to premier skin characters. In their single-player ending, Krang had sent them to the world where the war between the Insurgency and Regime was taking place. After the victory over Brainiac, Harley Quinn serves some pizza with 5-U-93-R. With this, they became powerful enough to return home and defeat Krang and Shredder.

Leonardo is featured as a TMNT season pass in &quot;Smite&quot; as an Osiris skin, voiced by Matthew Curtis. He is also available as a skin in &quot;Brawlhalla&quot;.

Leonardo is also a main playable character in the sequel to &quot;Turtles in Time&quot;, titled &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. In the game, Leonardo once more plays the role of the &quot;standard&quot; character, with equal statistics in range, speed, and power. This is the second official &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; game in which he is played by his original voice actor, Cam Clarke.

Leonardo also appeared in &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl&quot;, with Cam Clarke reprising his role.

<text>Raphael, nicknamed Raph, is a superhero and one of the four main characters of the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comics and all related media. In most iterations, he is depicted as the most aggressive of the turtle brothers, physically the strongest, and often at odds with his brother, Leonardo.

He is usually depicted wearing a red eye mask; in this regard, he is the only turtle to retain this color since the original incarnation of the characters, as the remaining turtles received different colors at a later time. Raphael wields twin sai as his primary weapon. He is commonly portrayed in media as speaking with a Brooklyn accent. Raphael is known for his temperamental and cynical personality, being short-tempered, aggressive, sullen, maddened, sarcastic, and rebellious. The origin of Raphael&#x27;s anger is not always fully explored, but in some incarnations appears to stem partly from the realization that they are the only creatures of their kind and ultimately alone, while also bothered by the injustice the helpless and innocent suffer. Despite his fiery personality, he has shown a soft side on many occasions, mainly to Michelangelo.

Raphael is an opinionated and independent character who chafes under authority. He serves as the team&#x27;s . The combination of his personality and role contributes to his rivalry and frequent arguments with his brother and leader, Leonardo. When he feels as though Leonardo&#x27;s decision is not in the best interest of the family, for whatever reason, he is sure to voice it.

However, in a later iteration of the franchise, &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, his role as protector takes precedence over his traditional characterization and his dynamics with his brothers. In this series, Raphael is the eldest brother and his dynamic with Leonardo is effectively swapped—with Raphael now admonishing Leonardo for his irresponsible attitude and disregard for his role as leader.

Like all of the brothers, he is named after a Renaissance artist; in this case, he is named after the 16th-century Italian painter Raphael. In 2011, Raphael placed 23rd on IGN&#x27;s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes, a list that did not feature any of his brothers. He is the only Teenage Turtle brother whose name does not end in the letter &quot;O&quot;, even though the artist he got his name from is &quot;Raffaello&quot;.

==Comic books==

===Mirage Comics===
In the earliest black-and-white Mirage Comics, Raphael was the most violent turtle and had a tendency for going berserk either in battle or when his temper flared up. He has a somewhat cynical and sarcastic sense of humor. In later issues, it is shown that he is not particularly fond of the supernatural, stating so explicitly in &quot;Tales of Raphael: Bad Moon Rising&quot;.

Raphael mellowed somewhat as the series went on, possibly a key moment for his character development was when he allowed Leonardo to go in alone to defeat The Shredder after nearly being killed by the Foot Elite. Since then, he has been less likely to challenge Leonardo&#x27;s leadership, and on the whole is more friendly towards his family and allies.

Of his three brothers, Raphael is closest to Michelangelo, having stated this in the fourth issue of the Mirage &quot;TMNT&quot; comics. Raphael often shows a caring, more laid-back, side of himself when around Mikey, frequently indulging the young turtle emotionally when at home and ferociously protecting him from harm when in battle. Raphael openly admits that the mere thought of Mikey being grievously injured causes him to experience violent rage. In his self-titled one-shot miniseries, Raphael meets human vigilante Casey Jones, his foil, who is more violent and unstable than he was. Despite their brutal first meeting, the two have since formed a close bond.

In the Mirage comic book series&#x27; Volume 4, he is still the most violent turtle but is more sociable. After having been bitten by a vampire-like creature, he experienced a further mutation and became a large, dinosaur-like version of himself. He went into a state of berserk animal rage because of it, but with some guidance from an inner manifestation of Master Splinter, he regained his original mentality and later assisted Leonardo and Casey Jones in tracking down the vampires who attacked him. This is also somewhat similar to an earlier storyline during Volume 1, where Raphael was attacked by a leech-like creature who, when sucking his blood, also drained him of the mutagen in his body and reverted him to a small turtle. The leech itself mutated and vanished, prompting the remaining turtles to follow it. Finally, after tracking down the creature, Raphael manages to bite it and pierce its skin, thereby drinking its blood and mutating it back.

This incarnation of Raphael appeared in the crossover special &quot;Turtles Forever&quot; voiced by Sean Schemmel.

===Image Comics===
In the Image series that treated the first two volumes of the Mirage Comics as canonical, Raphael was blasted in the face and disfigured. After that, he wore one of Casey Jones&#x27; hockey masks for much of the time, and eventually just an eye patch. Later, Raphael wore Shredder&#x27;s armor in an attempt to psychologically dominate a number of the New York Mob, with whom the Foot Clan was engaged in a losing gang war. He donned a slightly variant version of the armor and pretended to be the Shredder to get the advantage on his pursuers. He succeeded in defeating them and was then accepted into, and given control of, the New York faction of the Foot Clan for a brief time. In the independent published series of Image Comics #24, Raphael had an eyepatch and red bandana for the whole issue and was even angrier than ever. He killed Cheng with whom he had been friends in issue #25, and as soon as Pimiko was killed by the gauntlet of Lady Shredder, Raph removed his bandana and eyepatch to reveal his left eye was no longer disfigured but was back to normal. He later said to Leonardo he had a thing for Pimiko, and like Donatello with Baxter&#x27;s help in ridding him of cyborg parts, Raphael kept his crush on Pimiko a secret.

===Archie Comics===
The Archie Comics series was titled &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures&quot; and began as a direct adaptation of the popular cartoon series in the late 1980s. After the second story arc, Raphael changed costumes and began wearing an all-dark ninja outfit which he won during an Alien Wrestling Match. He would be the first member of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to have a girlfriend, meeting Ninjara in issue #28 and breaking up near the end of the magazine&#x27;s 75-issue run. In the future, Raphael would lose an eye during a conflict with the Shredder, Verminator X, and Armaggon (in most of the future timeline incarnations of Raphael, his left eye is missing). He would time travel after his brother Donatello invented the technology and eventually retire on the island Turtleco (which used to be Manhattan) and become a bar owner.

===IDW Comics===
In the IDW Comics, Raphael, like his brothers, is one of the reincarnated sons of Hamato Yoshi, who was murdered by Oroku Saki in medieval Japan. He began his new life in the present as a young turtle in the laboratory of StockGen Research, Inc., Baxter Stockman&#x27;s genetics laboratory, and served as a guinea pig for an experiment to be grown to be a naturally armored super soldier. Some ninjas tried to seize the Turtles and various other research results from the laboratory, including a mutagen. The intervention also led his reincarnated father, now a lab rat, and the Turtles to be doused with a chemical cocktail that triggered their mutation.

Shortly before his mutation, Raphael was separated from his family during an attack from a hungry street cat. He panicked as he mutated and was taken under the wing of a homeless man named Buck. However, Buck was murdered by street thugs, inspiring rage and grief in Raphael.

In the fifteen months after his mutation, he resided as a vagrant on the streets of New York City without a memory of his life before his transformation, or even of a name. During this time, his brothers regularly searched for him but did not find him. After befriending Casey Jones during a domestic dispute, Raphael was attacked by Old Hob, the street cat now mutated, but the other Turtles intervened and brought an uncertain but happy Raphael home to Splinter. He trained extensively with them for the next month, making incredible progress and being rewarded with a pair of sais.

His new family&#x27;s status was soon put to the test when their home was attacked by M.O.U.S.E.R. robots and Splinter was abducted. Raphael fought alongside his brothers to get their father back but came to the attention of the Shredder and the Foot Clan in the process.

Despite joining his brothers in their training and patrols, Raphael maintained his friendship with Casey by sometimes going out and assaulting criminals. When Casey was badly beaten by his father, Raphael lost his temper and set out to murder the man, but was stopped by Splinter, who taught him that he fights with too much anger.

His anger was turned inward during the City Fall storyline, in which rescuing a stabbed Casey from Shredder led to Leonardo being captured by the Foot Clan and brainwashed by Kitsune, becoming loyal to the Foot and Shredder, becoming murderous and sinister. Devastated, Raphael blamed the entire event on himself, and savagely attacked Foot Clan from informants until Michelangelo and Donatello stopped him. When Splinter and the Turtles tried to extract the brainwashed Leonardo from Shredder&#x27;s clutches, Raphael managed to penetrate some of the brainwashing and remind Leo of who they were.

At the O&#x27;Neil Farm in Northampton, Raphael clashed again with the emotionally disturbed Leonardo, until Leonardo physically attacked him. From then on, Raphael watched and guarded his brother from a distance; including keeping Alopex away from him but did not engage him. He became more friendly with the mutant fox Alopex, though any trust he had for her was still shaky and he incorrectly believed that she had betrayed them when the Foot attacked.

Due to Hob&#x27;s early efforts to kill him, Raphael remained extremely wary of Old Hob and did not believe that their family should be working with him. Despite this wariness, he still went on errands to Hob on Splinter&#x27;s behalf.

During the &quot;Turtles in Time&quot; event, Raphael was captured by Utroms in prehistoric times and adopted a small dinosaur he named Pepperoni. When Leonardo attempted to change the past by killing Oroku Saki in medieval Japan, it was Raphael who talked him out of it. He participated in the attack on the Technodrome with his brothers Leonardo and Michelangelo, where they fought Krang. However, he was devastated upon returning to New York, where a dying Donatello was barely saved by the Fugitoid by being transferred into the body of the robot Metalhead. Raphael remained convinced that Donatello was not really &quot;alive&quot; and that the Fugitoid would not be able to save his life. In particular, he blamed himself for leaving Donatello behind.

When Splinter entered his family into the Gauntlet, an ancient ritual that would end the bloody conflict between them and the Foot, Raphael was pitted against the powerful but dimwitted Rocksteady, who had nearly beaten Donatello to death. He and Michelangelo used their skill and agility to pit Bebop and Rocksteady against each other. He participated in the final fight against Shredder along with his brothers, with his father as the victor.

When his father became leader of the Foot Clan, Raphael reluctantly joined as well, though he remained somewhat distant from it compared to Leonardo. He also remained in contact with their newly estranged brother Michelangelo, assuring him that he knew how hard it was to be homeless, and that Michelangelo would always have a home with them.

The brothers reunited for a trip to Burnow Island shortly thereafter, where they encountered a mysterious alligator mutant named Leatherhead. Raphael and Leonardo also sought out two of Krang&#x27;s remaining warriors, Tragg and Granitor, only to be knocked out by Leatherhead. They pursued the alligator to New York but lost him.

Upon returning home, Raphael and his brothers were horrified to see Kitsune about to kill Splinter, and a brainwashed Alopex assisting her. Kitsune ensnared Raphael&#x27;s mind and turned him against Leonardo.

Raphael attempted to reconcile Michelangelo with his family in the Chasing Phantoms arc, in which he argued that Michelangelo should be with them, even if their new place was as part of the Foot Clan. However, he became increasingly uncomfortable with Splinter&#x27;s methods. And upon Splinter&#x27;s execution of Darius Dun, Raphael changed his mind and decided that Michelangelo had been right all along, leaving the Foot Clan along with Donatello and Leonardo, and moving back into their old lair.

During the days that followed, Raphael participated in a raucous Christmas party, assisted Angel Bridge in bringing a traumatized Alopex back to New York, and infiltrated the Pantheon Family Reunion, with nearly-deadly results. He returned to Dimension X with his brothers in The Trial of Krang story arc, in which they were required to bring back a collection of key witnesses to testify against Krang. During the trial, he participated in the defense of Planet Neutrino from the Malignoid swarm. Afterward, he and his brothers were attacked by the Collectors, and Raphael was forced to go on an inter-dimensional journey with Ray Stantz, resulting in his body temporarily being stolen by Viking ghosts.

His strained relationship with Splinter became even more so when the Turtles returned to Earth, and found the Foot Clan in conflict with the Triceratons. When Splinter attempted to imprison the Turtles for their safety, Raphael was particularly outraged. He later accompanied his brothers to attempt to defuse the situation, defeating the Elite Foot ninja in the process. When Bishop attacked Burnow Island, Raphael was reluctant to assist the Utroms and Triceratons but accompanied his brothers anyway.

He was captured by Agent Bishop shortly afterward and experimented on, as the E.P.F. wished to know what made the Turtles different from other mutants. They intended to kill and dissect him, but Raphael broke free and escaped, reminded of Buck and his losses and pain from the past. He defeated many E.P.F. personnel, before being rescued by Casey, Angel, and Alopex.

The miniseries &quot;TMNT: The Last Ronin&quot; depicts a dark future where almost all of the Turtles and their allies have been killed by the Foot Clan, now led by Shredder&#x27;s grandson Hiroto Saki. Raphael is the first turtle to die; when a truce between the Turtles and the Foot is broken with an attack on Splinter that leaves the rat near death, Raphael mounts a one-man assault on the Foot and drowns while trying to kill Karai, who is herself left in a permanent coma from her injuries.

==Television==
===1987 animated series===
Raphael&#x27;s personality in the 1987 animated series deviates the most from all other incarnations, though the show&#x27;s theme song states that Raphael is &quot;cool, but rude&quot; (he takes a slice of pizza with his sai and shoves the rest of it onto the screen before eating the selected slice). Although his violent temper is toned down, Raphael still can get cranky when annoyed or angry.

Raphael is a sardonic wise guy, and supplies alongside Michelangelo, whose humor is usually attributed to his carefree and fun-loving behavior, whereas Raphael is more sardonic and sarcastic.

Michelangelo and Raphael&#x27;s relationship is not exactly confrontational. However, Raphael would make fun of or get annoyed with Michelangelo&#x27;s antics. Furthermore, Raphael&#x27;s relationship with Leonardo is not as strained in the animated series. Despite this, Raphael usually served as a contrast to Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;gung-ho do-gooder&quot; personality with his pessimistic, sarcastic remarks. However, Raphael did challenge Leonardo&#x27;s leadership once in the season 8 episode &quot;Turtle Trek&quot;.

In the 1987 series, Raphael&#x27;s voice actor is Rob Paulsen from season one to season nine with Thom Pinto as the 1989 alternate, Hal Rayle as the 1993 alternate, and Michael Gough in the final season. In &quot;Turtles Forever&quot;, the 1987 version of Raphael is voiced by Sebastian Arcelus. Raphael also made a couple of appearances in the 2012 series in the episode, The Manhattan Project. He and the other turtles along with Casey and April are seen through a portal by their 2012 counterparts walking on a road and he makes a speaking cameo along with the other turtles at the end of the episode when a space worm from the 2012 dimension starts terrorizing the street. All four turtles see the worm and spring into action while shouting their famous catchphrase, &#x27;Cowabunga&#x27;. This would be Rob Paulsen&#x27;s second role in the 2012 series, the other being Donatello while he returned to his role as Raphael for the cameo. This would mark the first time in over 28 years the 1987 TMNT cast would return to their roles. Paulsen once again provided the voices of the 1987 Raphael and the 2012 Donatello in the season 4 episode, &quot;Trans-Dimensional Turtles&quot; and the three-part series final &quot;Wanted: Bebop &amp; Rocksteady&quot;.

===Coming Out of Their Shells tour===
A live-action &quot;Coming Out of Their Shells&quot; concert tour, whose inaugural show was broadcast on pay-per-view from Radio City Music Hall and later released on VHS in 1990. The concert depicted the Turtles as having formed a band, and beginning their tour in their canonical home of New York City. Raphael is stated during the song &quot;Cowabunga&quot; as having written the music for all the songs performed at the concert, while Michelangelo provided the lyrics. In the inaugural show, Raphael is depicted as playing the drums, including an electronic device that imitates drum sounds that he can control and adjust as necessary. He also splits lead vocals with Michelangelo. Like his film counterpart released the same year, Raphael is depicted as more prone to anger than the rest of his brothers, but ultimately able to get past his issues to help the Turtles defeat Shredder&#x27;s plan to steal all the world&#x27;s music. In the &quot;Making Of&quot; VHS tape which was released as a supplement to the Radio City Music Hall show and depicted the Turtles as if they were real people, Raphael and Michelangelo relate the story of how the band started; The two were waiting on a pizza delivery, and Raphael had begun playing on some sewer pipes, and Michelangelo joined in with a bit of singing. Realizing they enjoyed making music, they began to pursue it as a serious hobby, eventually bringing Leonardo and Donatello into their activities, leading to them forming the band and eventually going on tour.

One of the actors to portray Raphael during the tour was Michael Ian Black.

===1997 live-action series===
Raphael appears in the live-action series, &quot;Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation&quot;, as well as its crossover episode with &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot; portrayed by Mitchell A. Lee Yuen and voiced by Matt Hill.

===2003 animated series===
In the 2003 series, Raphael is voiced by Greg Abbey and speaks with a Brooklyn accent. In this incarnation, he has a dark, bright green skin color, much more vivid than those of his brothers. This version of Raphael has a personality that is more akin to his Mirage incarnation - he is angrier and more sardonic, but not quite as violent as his darker personality from the comics, unless furious - as proven in one incident where he almost smashed Michelangelo&#x27;s head in with a pipe after Mikey beat him in a sparring match. The theme song for seasons 1-3 did not have a part that described each turtle individually, but from season 4 onwards it was changed, and stated, &quot;Count on Raphael to throw the first punch&quot;.

His relationship with Leonardo is brotherly and they sometimes bicker due to their strong opinions. He is the first of the turtles to shed tears when Leonardo is gravely injured and might not survive. Overall Raphael is close with him.

His relationship with Donatello is a more mellow one compared to his other two brothers. They get along very well and they have a close bond like twins. He is usually the first to compliment his invention. Raphael&#x27;s favorite of Donatello&#x27;s inventions is the Shell Cycle. He uses it very often.

However, Raphael&#x27;s relationship with Michelangelo is very difficult. Michelangelo would annoy Raphael with his antics and insults, and Raphael would put up a fight or reprimand him. Both of them tend to argue with each other. However, when Michelangelo is in danger, Raphael would help him. Overall, it is just a love-hate relationship.

Raphael is generally very protective of his brothers, getting outraged when an enemy harms them or captures them. His best friend is generally regarded as Casey Jones and is the best man at Casey and April O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s wedding in the final episode of this series.

===2012 animated series===

Raphael is voiced by Sean Astin in the 2012 series.

Raphael&#x27;s character design was updated, giving him green eyes as well as a small, lightning-shaped chip out of his plastron across his left shoulder (a scar that resulted from an injury Raphael received as a baby). In this incarnation, Raphael is described (in the theme song) as having &quot;the most attitude on the team&quot;. Raphael can get incredibly explosive when he feels hurt or misunderstood. Sometimes he would walk out on the team to do his own thing or prove himself better, which has happened many times.

Raphael&#x27;s behavior is inconsistent. Sometimes Raphael would cooperate and take orders and sometimes he will rebel. His relationship with Leonardo is strained. Raphael would erupt at Leonardo and Leonardo would either try to calm him down or confront him. Raphael hated the fact that Leonardo was the leader and often tried to take over as leader, even succeeding twice as the Seasons progressed. In Season 5, Raphael does not backtalk to Leonardo as much as he did in the earlier season probably because Leonardo is the sensei and has more control when it comes to Raphael. Despite all of this, Leonardo and Raphael are very close and care deeply for each other. They would team up to fight and challenge Donatello and Michelangelo during training.

Raphael&#x27;s relationship with his two brothers Michelangelo and Donatello is not as bad as his relationship with Leonardo but it can be tense at times. Sometimes he would attack or challenge them, especially in training and other times they would team up to mock Leonardo. When Michelangelo annoys him, Raphael insults him. However, Raphael is a big brother to Mikey and serves as his role model, reassuring and comforting him and even saying he is awesome at one point. Raphael&#x27;s relationship with Donatello often involves counterarguments. Donatello and Raphael would sometimes argue and insult each other like Donatello calls him a &quot;big baby&quot; whenever Raphael erupts or when Raphael calls Donatello a &quot;dork&quot;. When Raphael behaves in an upsetting manner and when his brothers confront him, he will get in denial at first but then he will reluctantly or willingly apologize.

Raphael has a soft spot for his pets which helps him calm him down. A normal pet turtle named Spike, later mutates and becomes this show&#x27;s version of Slash. Later on, he got an alien turtle named Chompy Picasso. Raphael is also petrified of cockroaches until he manages to defeat the mutant cockroach, Spyroach.

===2018 animated series===

In the 2018 animated series, &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, Omar Benson Miller voices Raphael, who in this incarnation is the eldest turtle brother and physically biggest brother, being mutated from an Alligator Snapping Turtle. Before Leonardo being named the official team leader by Splinter in the second season finale, Raph is the team&#x27;s de facto leader, a change from previous incarnations, and his enthusiasm and bravado put him front and center for most of their bizarre adventures. Unlike past versions, he does not use his trademarked Sai, but rather he uses a pair of Tonfa (though he does gain his trademark Sai in the final episodes after his Tonfa are destroyed by the Shredder). He is also considerably less angry and more serious than previous incarnations, though still eager to get into fights.

In &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie&quot;, Raph has a heated argument with Leo over the latter&#x27;s high ego and tells him how hard it is being a leader. Raph sacrifices himself to the Krang to save Leo from being captured and ends up paradoxically possessed for part of the film. Leo helps Raph break free and the two reconcile at the end of the movie after Leo defeats the Krang.

===&quot;Tales of the TMNT&quot; (2024)===
Raph appears in &quot;Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, a follow-up 2d-animated series sequel to &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot;, with Brady Noon reprising his role from the latter film.

==Movies==

===Original trilogy (1990–1993)===
In the 1990 film adaptation, Raphael is played by Josh Pais; the only actor to play both the physical (in the suit) and voice roles as a turtle. He speaks with a distinctive tough-sounding New York accent (that was imitated in the later versions of TMNT) and is the turtle whose character is explored most completely. He has a quick temper, uses profanity, and verbally challenges his brother Leonardo. This film focuses more so on his feeling of isolation from his brothers and his sense of regret and anger when Splinter is eventually captured by the Shredder. Here, it is established that he shares a closer relationship with news reporter April O&#x27;Neil having saved her from the Foot Clan on several occasions.

In &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot;, he is played by Kenn Troum, and voiced by Laurie Faso, and in the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot; film he is played by Matt Hill, and voiced by Tim Kelleher. In the films, he is still angry and occasionally goes off by himself in the second movie, but has a soft spot for the young people the team meets. It is also shown that he has an appreciation for nature as it appears to calm him.

===2007 film===
In &quot;TMNT&quot;, Raphael (voiced by Nolan North) is the only member of the Turtles who has continued to fight evil and crime on the streets in the absence of their leader, Leonardo; he has spent his nights as an armored vigilante known as The Nightwatcher. His time as the Nightwatcher is one of the few instances in which Raphael does not use his trademark sai; instead, he uses a manriki: weighted chains that can be concealed in the hands and used from considerable distances. Unlike his sai, the manikin are typically non-lethal weapons (though they could prove fatal if used with enough force).

Raphael keeps his solo vigilantism a secret from his family, however, which leads to tension and distrust between him and Donatello in particular (as Donatello is implied to be the one in charge in Leonardo&#x27;s absence). Donatello claims that &quot;all [Raphael does] is sleep all day&quot; and that at least he and Michelangelo contribute to the household. Raphael aggressively confronts him and sarcastically agrees that he does nothing, Donatello has him all figured out. Donatello claims that Raphael&#x27;s tendency to rely on fear to accomplish things (i.e. get what he wants) is wrong. Raphael responds by threatening to punch him, causing Donatello to flinch; Raphael smirks and claims he made his point.

Raphael&#x27;s relationship with Michelangelo is not touched upon much in the movie, but they do not seem to have the same antagonistic relationship that Raphael has with his other brothers. This may be in part because Michelangelo is shown on multiple occasions to admire the Nightwatcher.

What takes center stage, however, is Raphael&#x27;s rocky relationship with Leonardo. The animosity between them in this adaptation is arguably the most intense of the iterations. It is made apparent that Raphael resents Leonardo for leaving (or perhaps only because he stayed away an additional year past his original indeterminate training period). Master Splinter informs Leonardo, upon his return, that he should speak with Raphael as his &quot;absence has been particularly difficult for [Raphael], though [Raphael] will never admit it&quot;.

Raphael&#x27;s anger grows when Leonardo acts as though nothing has changed—treating his brothers like his &quot;little soldiers&quot; despite (at least from Raphael&#x27;s perspective) abandoning them. This is compounded by Leonardo insulting the Nightwatcher and his methods to which Raphael replies that &quot;crime never took a break, you did&quot;.

The tension between Raphael and Leonardo comes to a head when Leonardo later confronts the Nightwatcher. The confrontation devolves into a physical altercation in which Raphael&#x27;s identity is revealed. After a verbal altercation, they begin to fight anew. They appear equally matched, until Raphael is visibly overtaken by rage, breaks Leonardo&#x27;s katana, and barely refrains from mortally wounding him. Similar to previous iterations, Raphael retreats in a panic after realizing what his anger almost led to. Due to his disarmed state and exhaustion, Leonardo is easily subdued and kidnapped—for which Raphael feels responsible.

Raphael returns to the lair and in a fit of self-recrimination, confesses to Master Splinter that he understands why Leonardo is &quot;the better son and [he] is not&quot;. Master Splinter responds by explaining that Raphael&#x27;s tendency to bear &quot;the world&#x27;s problems on [his] shoulders&quot; is an admirable quality as a protector and emphasizes that while Raphael may not be his favorite student at times, that does not mean he is his least favorite son. He tells Raphael that his strength, passion, and loyalty are also merits of a great leader, but only if they can be tempered with compassion and humility. Though Master Splinter&#x27;s words seem to calm him, Raphael still shows resistance to the compliments and admits his grave mistake: his actions led to Leonardo being taken.

Raphael, his family, Casey, and April rescue Leonardo. When they locate him inside Winter&#x27;s tower, Raphael personally hands Leonardo a new set of katana. Throughout the final battle, the brothers seamlessly fight alongside one another, instead of against one another.

After the battle, the movie ends with Raphael retiring as the Nightwatcher and placing his helmet among memorabilia in Splinter&#x27;s shrine.

The movie ends with Raphael narrating about the importance of his bonds with his brothers over top of the classic scene of the turtles leaping across rooftops together.

===Reboot series (2014–2016)===
Raphael appears in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; portrayed by Alan Ritchson. In the film, he is aggressive and struggles with following orders. He often loses his temper and has fierce independence, which does not sit well with his brother Leonardo. He is the first turtle that April O&#x27;Neil sees after stopping the Foot Clan, although she does not get a good look at him and thinks he is a man. When April takes their picture, Raph threatens her even after Donatello erases her phone&#x27;s memory data. In the battle at the turtle&#x27;s lair with the Foot, Raph is crushed under rubble and is presumed dead. Because of this, he is the only turtle not captured by the Foot. When he awakes, he finds a dying Splinter who tells him and April to save his brothers. They team up with Vern Fenwick to help him save them from Sacks Industries, where he fights Shredder to buy April and Vern time to do so. After rescuing Leonardo, Donatello, and Michelangelo and defeating the Shredder, Raphael and his brothers use the mutagen to save Splinter&#x27;s life. He, along with Donatello and Leonardo, does not try to get April&#x27;s attention, unlike Michelangelo who does voice his feelings to April. Although in the end of the movie, he does show appreciation to her for sacrificing everything for them. In this incarnation, Raphael is not as hot-headed and does not clash with Leonardo over leadership however they have a brief argument over the Hatamishi which Raphael refuses to go to and claims he will leave which Leo debunks. He is more close to his brothers in the film than in most adaptations. He still get annoyed at Donatello when he talks of his calculations in a way the others do not understand. He is the only turtle in the film to not wear any footwear, much like other adaptations of the turtles.

In the sequel, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;, Raphael is shown to be more like his standard self. He becomes enraged when he learns Leonardo had ordered Donnie not to reveal to him or Mikey about the Purple Ooze being able to turn them into humans, stating that Leo broke the third code of the ninja (honor) by lying to his brothers. He disobeys direct orders from Leo and has no problem lying to April and Casey to get them to go along on a mission with him. He does still show caring for his brothers as he and Mikey are shown to be very close, with the two of them pulling pranks on Casey Jones and Raph becoming enraged when Krang nearly kills Mikey. Raphael in the film is also shown to have a fear of great heights, possibly due to the events of the first film; while the other turtles leap out of an airplane with little thought Raphael puts on a parachute and even then must psych himself up to perform the jump.

===DC crossover film===
Raphael appears in the direct-to-video crossover film &quot;Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, voiced by Darren Criss. At the beginning of the movie, he is seen among his brothers saving Barbara Gordon and stopping the Foot. They then fought the Penguin and his goons and later Batman, who easily defeats them and takes one of his sais.

=== &quot;Mutant Mayhem&quot; ===
Raphael appears in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem&quot;, the first animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film since &quot;TMNT (2007)&quot;, voiced by real teenager Brady Noon. This version of the character is implied to have temperamental issues, as he is incapable of retaining his actions and becomes incredibly excited and unfocused when fighting. He ends up befriending Bebop and Rocksteady due to their shared love showing off their strength and abilities and is glad when they switch over to their side and become a family.

==Video games==
In the first few video games, based on the 1987 cartoon, Raphael was an unpopular character because of the short range of his weapon. He is the least skilled Turtle, the same goes for the video game based on the 2007 movie TMNT. He appears in &quot;&quot; as a playable character, with Frank Frankson reprising his role. The Nightwatcher also makes an appearance as a separate playable character.

Raphael is one of the main playable characters in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot; video game, where he is voiced by Carlos Alazraqui. His special move is Iron Fists, where he puts on iron gloves which have extremely high power, but little range. Raphael also appears in the 2014 film-based game, voiced by Roy Samuelson.

Raphael is featured as one of the playable characters from &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; as DLC in &quot;Injustice 2&quot;, voiced by Ben Rausch. While Leonardo is the default turtle outside the gear loadout, he, Michelangelo, and Donatello can only be picked through the said loadout selection similar to the premier skin characters.

Raphael is featured as a TMNT season pass in &quot;Smite&quot; as a Loki skin, voiced by Mark Whitten. He is also available as a skin in &quot;Brawlhalla&quot;.

Raphael appears in &quot;Pixel Gun 3D&quot; as a skin called &quot;Super Turtle&quot;.

Raphael is also a main playable character in the sequel to &quot;Turtles in Time&quot;, titled &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. In the game, Raphael is now the turtle with the most attack power and average speed, as opposed to &quot;Turtles in Time&quot;, where he had the highest speed with average attack power. He carries over his limited range from the original game. This is the first official &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; game in which he is played by his original voice actor, Rob Paulsen.

Raphael appears in &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6&quot; as a playable operator in the multiplayer and Zombies modes, voiced by Roger Craig Smith.

==Reception==

In 2008, Raphael shared the fifth place with Leonardo on TechCrunch&#x27;s list of Top 10 Video Game Ninja Characters. As mentioned above, he came in 23rd on IGN&#x27;s list of Top 100 comic book heroes.

<doc id="538070" wikidata="Q1194204" url="?curid=538070" title="Perfidious Albion">
<text>&quot;Perfidious Albion&quot; is a pejorative phrase used within the context of international relations diplomacy to refer to acts of diplomatic slights, duplicity, treachery and hence infidelity (with respect to perceived promises made to or alliances formed with other nation states) by monarchs or governments of the United Kingdom (or Great Britain prior to 1801, or England prior to 1707) in their pursuit of self-interest and the expansion of the British Empire. 
&quot;&quot; means not keeping one&#x27;s faith or word (from the Latin word &quot;perfidia&quot;); &quot;Albion&quot; is an ancient and now poetic name for Great Britain.

== Origins and use ==
The use of the adjective &quot;perfidious&quot; to describe England has a long history; instances have been found as far back as the 13th century. A very similar phrase was used in a sermon by 17th-century French bishop and theologian Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet:

The coinage of the phrase in its current form, however, is conventionally attributed to Augustin Louis de Ximénès, a French-Spanish playwright who wrote it in a poem entitled &quot;&quot;, published in 1793:

In this context, Great Britain&#x27;s perfidy was political. In the early days of the French Revolution, when the revolution aimed at establishing a liberal constitutional monarchy along British lines, many in Great Britain had looked upon the Revolution with mild favour. Diminishing the threat that Royalist France posed to British interests was an additional factor encouraging support for the new regime. 
However, following the turn of the revolution to republicanism with the overthrow and execution of Louis XVI, Britain, concerned that revolutionary fervor might spread to other countries, had allied itself with the other monarchies of Europe against the Revolution in France. This was seen by the revolutionaries in France as a &quot;perfidious&quot; betrayal.

&quot;&quot; became a stock expression in France in the 19th century, to the extent that the Goncourt brothers could refer to it as &quot;a well-known old saying&quot;. It was utilised by French journalists whenever there were tensions between France and Britain, for example during the competition for colonies in Africa, culminating in the Fashoda Incident. The catch-phrase was further popularized by its use in , the first French comic strip, in which one of the characters fulminates against &quot;Perfidious Albion, which burnt Joan of Arc on the rock of Saint Helena&quot;. (This sentence mixes two major incidents in French history that can be related to the UK&#x27;s perfidy: Joan of Arc, whose execution may have been due to English influence; and Napoleon, who died in exile on Saint Helena. He may have died by being poisoned, according to the Swedish toxicologist Sten Forshufvud. There is however, significant speculation that the use of arsenic as a dye may be related to Napoleon&#x27;s death.)

In German-speaking areas, the term &quot;&quot; became increasingly frequent, especially during the rule of the German Empire (1871–1918) against the backdrop of rising British-German tensions.

=== Examples of usage ===

* The term often refers to the Kingdom of England reneging on the Treaty of Limerick of 1691, which ended the Williamite War between the predominantly Roman Catholic Jacobite forces and the English forces loyal to William of Orange, giving favourable terms to the Irish Catholics, including the freedoms to worship, to own property and to carry arms, but those terms were soon repudiated by the Penal Laws of 1695.
* The Irish ballad &quot;The Foggy Dew&quot; includes the term in its lyrics. The song concerns the Easter Rising and the hypocrisy that England is concurrently fighting World War I so that &quot;Small Nations might be free&quot;, while Ireland&#x27;s struggle for freedom is forcibly suppressed.
* In Portugal, the term was widely used after the 1890 British Ultimatum, after Cecil Rhodes&#x27; opposition to the Pink Map. Portugal and England had been allied since 1386.
* Bastiat uses the term sarcastically in his satirical letter &quot;The Candlemakers&#x27; Petition&quot;, first published in 1845.
* The Italian term &quot;&quot; (perfidious Albion) was used in the propaganda of Fascist Italy to criticise the global dominion of the British Empire. Fascist propaganda depicted the British as ruthless colonialists, who exploited foreign lands and peoples to feed extravagant lifestyle habits like eating &quot;five meals a day&quot;. The term was used frequently in Italian politics after the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, because despite having gained large colonial territories for itself, Britain approved of trade sanctions in the wake of Italian aggression against Ethiopia. The sanctions were depicted as an attempt to deny Italy its &quot;rightful&quot; colonial dominions, while at the same time, Britain was trying to extend its own influence and authority. The same term was used after World War I related to the so-called mutilated victory.
* During the Vichy French regime, Philippe Petain made frequent use of the term &quot;blood-soaked Perfidious Albion&quot; and described the UK as the relentless &quot;eternal enemy&quot; of France. Such sentiments were exacerbated by the British Attack on Mers-el-Kébir, which caused great bitterness in France and went a great way towards reinforcing the perfidious stereotype. Petain further regarded England as always having been France&#x27;s most implacable enemy, with Vichy propaganda mixing Anglophobia with racism and anti-Semitism to portray the British as a racially degenerate &quot;mixed race&quot; working for Jewish capitalists, in contrast to the &quot;racially pure&quot; peoples on the continent of Europe who were building a &quot;New Order.&quot;
* The father of Israeli novelist Amos Oz wrote pamphlets for the Irgun that attacked &quot;perfidious Albion&quot; during the British rule in Palestine.
* After their victory against England at the 1950 World Cup, the president of the Spanish Football Federation (Armando Muñoz Calero) sent a telegram to Spanish dictator Francisco Franco that read, &quot;we have beaten Perfidious Albion.&quot;
* It is used by Ian Smith in his memoirs (&quot;The Great Betrayal&quot;, 1997) to describe his opposition on the British handling of Rhodesian independence.
* In his book &quot;I&#x27;m Not the Only One&quot; (2004), British politician George Galloway expressed the opinion that Kuwait is &quot;clearly a part of the greater Iraqi whole, stolen from the motherland by perfidious Albion&quot;.
* In 2012, Fabian Picardo, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, used the phrase to describe the UK government&#x27;s position on the UN Decolonisation Committee: &quot;Perfidious Albion, for this reason ... The position of the United Kingdom is as usual so nuanced that it&#x27;s difficult to see where they are on the spectrum, but look that&#x27;s what Britain&#x27;s like and we all love being British&quot;.
* The term was used in reference to a possible United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union in the run up to the referendum on the issue in 2016. An article in the French newspaper claimed that a poll showing that only 54% of French people supported UK membership of the EU (compared to 55% of British people) showed that &quot;the British will always be seen as the Perfidious Albion&quot;. In contrast, the editor of the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Lionel Barber, has written that &quot;Too many people in the UK are under the illusion that most European countries cannot wait to see the back of perfidious Albion.&quot; Eventually, the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU.
* In arguing for a &quot;hard&quot; Brexit, and the EU rejecting a possible extension requested by the UK of the deadline to leave the EU, the Brexit-supporting British MP Mark Francois said to the Bruges Group in April 2019: &quot;My message to the European Council ... If you now try to hold on to us against our will, you will be facing Perfidious Albion on speed. It would therefore be much better for all our sakes if we were to pursue our separate destinies, in a spirit of mutual respect.&quot;
