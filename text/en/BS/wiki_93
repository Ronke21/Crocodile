<text>The 2nd Carrier Air Group (2nd CAG) was an aircraft carrier air group of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. It was initially formed in June 1945, for service in the British Pacific Fleet, until disbanding during the same year, in October. The group was embarked on (67).

== Naval Air Squadrons ==
The 2nd Carrier Air Group consisted of a number of squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm.
== History ==

=== 1945 ===

The 2nd Carrier Air Group was formed on 30 June 1945. It was based on the , for service as part of the British Pacific Fleet. The 2nd CAG was formed of 848 Naval Air Squadron, which was equipped with Grumman Avenger, an American torpedo bomber aircraft, 1841 Naval Air Squadron and 1842 Naval Air Squadron, both from the 6th Naval Fighter Wing, and operated the Vought Corsair an American carrier-borne fighter aircraft.

During July and August 1945, the group was involved with attacks on the Japanese mainland. On 17 July, the 2nd Carrier Air Group flew twenty eight of its Vought Corsair aircraft, off &quot;Formidable&quot;, bound for targets north of Tokyo, however, some aircraft were unable to locate them due to bad weather. Twenty four aircraft attacked targets near Tokyo the following day, before more bad weather halted flying operations. Airstrikes resumed on 24 July, and then on 30 July, the Japanese escort ship Okinawa was attacked and sunk near Maizuru. However, a combination of bad weather, refuelling requirements and the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki resulted in a stop to any sorties until the resumption of air operations on 9 August.

The 2nd CAG’s Grumman Avenger aircraft flew off &quot;Formidable&quot; and attacked Matsushima Air Field during the morning of 9 August. This was followed by eight of the group’s Corsair aircraft, led by Lieutenant Robert Hampton Gray, RCNVR, a Canadian naval officer and senior pilot of 1841 Naval Air Squadron. However, Gray was diverted to attack Japanese warships located in Onagawa Wan, Miyagi Prefecture. Two escort ships were spotted and Gray led his aircraft into attack. Intense flak set his engine on fire, but he continued his attack, skip bombing a bomb into the &quot;Etorofu&quot;-class escort &quot;Amakusa&quot;, sinking the ship with the loss of 157 lives. Unfortunately, after releasing the bomb, Gray&#x27;s aircraft rolled inverted and crashed into the sea; he did not survive. Gray was later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

After the initial announcement of Japan&#x27;s surrender, on 15 August 1945, the group then left its aircraft in Australia and returned to the United Kingdom, on , where it disbanded on 31 October 1945.

<text>The Westland Lysander is a British army co-operation and liaison aircraft produced by Westland Aircraft that was used immediately before and during the Second World War.

After becoming obsolete in the army co-operation role, the aircraft&#x27;s short-field performance enabled clandestine missions using small, improvised airstrips behind enemy lines to place or recover agents, particularly in occupied France with the help of the French Resistance. Royal Air Force army co-operation aircraft were named after mythical or historical military leaders; in this case the Spartan admiral Lysander was chosen.

==Design and development==
In 1934 the Air Ministry issued Specification A.39/34 for an army co-operation aircraft to replace the Hawker Hector. Initially Hawker Aircraft, Avro and Bristol were invited to submit designs, but after some debate within the ministry, a submission from Westland was invited as well. The Westland design, internally designated P. 8, was the work of Arthur Davenport under the direction of &quot;Teddy&quot; Petter. It was Petter&#x27;s second aircraft design and he spent considerable time interviewing Royal Air Force pilots to find out what they wanted from such an aircraft. The army wanted a tactical and artillery reconnaissance aircraft to provide photographic reconnaissance and observation of artillery fire in daylight – up to about behind the enemy front. The result of Petter&#x27;s pilot enquiries suggested that field of view, low-speed handling characteristics and STOL performance were the important requirements.
Davenport and Petter designed an aircraft to incorporate these features. The Lysander was to be powered by a Bristol Mercury air-cooled radial engine and had high wings and a fixed conventional landing gear mounted on an innovative inverted U square-section tube that supported wing struts at the apex, and contained internal springs for the faired wheels. The large streamlined spats also contained a mounting for a Browning machine gun and fittings for removable stub wings that could carry light bombs or supply canisters. The wings had a reverse taper towards the root, which gave the impression of a bent gull wing from some angles, although the spars were straight. It had a girder type construction faired with a light wood stringers to give the aerodynamic shape. The forward fuselage was duralumin tube joined with brackets and plates, and the after part was welded stainless steel tubes. Plates and brackets were cut from channel extrusions rather than being formed from sheet steel. The front spar and lift struts were extrusions. The wing itself was fabric covered and its thickness was greatest at the strut anchorage, similar to that of later marks of the Stinson Reliant high-winged transport monoplane.

Despite its appearance, the Lysander was aerodynamically advanced; being equipped with fully automatic wing slats and slotted flaps and a variable incidence tailplane. These refinements gave the Lysander a stalling speed of only . The tube that supported the wings and wheels was the largest Elektron alloy extrusion made at the time. Due to the difficulties involved in manufacturing such a large extrusion Canadian-built machines had a conventionally fabricated assembly. The Air Ministry requested two prototypes of the P.8 and the competing Bristol Type 148, quickly selecting the Westland aircraft for production and issuing a contract in September 1936.

The high-lift devices gave the Lysander a short take off and landing (STOL) performance much appreciated by the Special Duties pilots such as Squadron Leader Hugh Verity. The wings were equipped with automatic slats which lifted away from the leading edge as the airspeed decreased towards stalling speed. These slats controlled automatic flaps. Slow speed flight was therefore greatly simplified, &quot;and it was possible to bring a Lysander down to land, if not like a lift, at least like an escalator&quot;. The inboard slats were connected to the flaps and to an air damper in the port wing which governed the speed at which the slats operated. The outboard slats operated independently and were not connected and each was fitted with an air damper. On a normal approach, the inboard slats and the flaps would begin to open when the airspeed has dropped to about and be approximately half down at . The only control that the pilot has is a locking lever which he can set to lock the flaps down once they have been lowered automatically.

==Operational history==
===United Kingdom===
The first Lysanders entered service in June 1938, equipping squadrons for army co-operation and were initially used for message-dropping and artillery spotting. When war broke out in Europe, the earlier Mk.Is had been largely replaced by Mk.IIs, the older machines heading for the Middle East. Some of these aircraft, now designated type L.1, operated with the Chindits of the British Indian Army in the Burma Campaign of the Second World War.

Four regular squadrons equipped with Lysanders accompanied the British Expeditionary Force to France in October 1939, and were joined by a further squadron early in 1940. Following the German invasion of France and the low countries on 10 May 1940, Lysanders were put into action as spotters and light bombers. In spite of occasional victories against German aircraft, they made very easy targets for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; even when escorted by Hurricanes. Withdrawn from France during the Dunkirk evacuation, they continued to fly supply-dropping missions to Allied forces from bases in England; on one mission to drop supplies to troops trapped at Calais, 14 of 16 Lysanders and Hectors that set out were lost. 118 Lysanders were lost in or over France and Belgium in May and June 1940, of a total of 175 deployed.

With the fall of France, it was clear that the type was unsuitable for the coastal patrol and army co-operation role, being described by Air Marshal Arthur Barratt, commander-in-chief of the British Air Forces in France as &quot;quite unsuited to the task; a faster, less vulnerable aircraft was required.&quot; The view of army AOP pilots was that the Lysander was too fast for artillery spotting purposes, too slow and un-manoeuvrable to avoid fighters, too big to conceal quickly on a landing field, too heavy to use on soft ground and had been developed by the RAF without ever asking the army what was needed. Nevertheless, throughout the remainder of 1940, Lysanders flew dawn and dusk patrols off the coast and in the event of an invasion of Britain, they were tasked with attacking the landing beaches with light bombs and machine guns. They were replaced in the home-based army co-operation role from 1941 by camera-equipped fighters such as the Curtiss Tomahawk and North American Mustang carrying out reconnaissance operations, while light aircraft such as the Taylorcraft Auster were used to direct artillery. Some UK-based Lysanders went to work operating air-sea rescue, dropping dinghies to downed RAF aircrew in the English Channel. Fourteen squadrons and flights were formed for this role in 1940 and 1941.

In India, Nos 20 and 28 Squadrons flying Westland Lysanders were listed as non-operational, but part of No. 221 Group RAF in the army co-operation role from Jamshedpur and Ranchi, respectively, on 1 July 1942.

====Special duties====

In August 1941 a new squadron, No. 138 (Special Duties), was formed to undertake missions for the Special Operations Executive to maintain clandestine contact with the French Resistance. Among its aircraft were Lysander Mk.IIIs, which flew over and landed in occupied France. While general supply drops could be left to the rest of No. 138&#x27;s aircraft, the Lysander could insert and remove agents from the continent or retrieve Allied aircrew who had been shot down over occupied territory and had evaded capture. For this role the Mk.IIIs were fitted with a fixed ladder over the port side to hasten access to the rear cockpit and a large drop tank under the belly. In order to slip in unobtrusively Lysanders were painted matte black overall (some early examples had brown/green camouflaged upper surfaces and later examples had grey/green upper surfaces). Operations almost always took place within a week of a full moon, as moonlight was essential for navigation. The aircraft undertook such duties until the liberation of France in 1944.

Lysanders were based at airfields at Newmarket in Suffolk and later Tempsford in Bedfordshire, but used regular RAF stations to fuel-up for the actual crossing, particularly RAF Tangmere. Flying without any navigation equipment other than a map and compass, Lysanders would land on short strips of land, such as fields, marked out by four or five torches or to avoid having to land, the agent, wearing a special padded suit, stepped off at very low altitude and rolled to a stop on the field. They were originally designed to carry one passenger in the rear cockpit, but for SOE use the rear cockpit of the Mk III (SD) version was modified to carry up to three passengers in case of urgent necessity as they were fitted with a rearward facing bench for two passengers (with a locker underneath) and a shelf at the rear of the compartment which could also serve as a seat for a third passenger.

The pilots of No. 138, and from early 1942 No. 161 Squadron, transported 101 agents to and recovered 128 agents from German-occupied Europe. The Germans knew little about the British aircraft and wished to study one. Soldiers captured an intact Lysander in March 1942 when its pilot was unable to destroy it after a crash, but a train hit the truck carrying the Lysander, destroying the cargo.

In the Far East, from 1944 No. 357 Squadron RAF operated six SD Lysanders as C Flight for dropping agents in support of Fourteenth Army in Burma.

Lysanders were also used as target-towing and communication aircraft. Two aircraft (&quot;T1443&quot; and &quot;T1739&quot;) were transferred to the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) for training and 18 were used by the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. All British Lysanders were withdrawn from service in 1946.

===Free French===
Lysander also joined the ranks of the &quot;Forces Aériennes Françaises Libres&quot; (Free French Air Force, FAFL) when &quot;Groupe Mixte de Combat&quot; (GMC) 1, formed at RAF Odiham on 29 August 1940, was sent to French North-West Africa in order to persuade the authorities in countries such as Gabon, Cameroon and Chad, which were still loyal to Vichy France, to join the Gaullist cause against the Axis powers, and to attack Italian ground forces in Libya. As with all FAFL aircraft, Lysanders sported the Cross of Lorraine insignia on the fuselage and the wings instead of the French tricolour roundel first used in 1914, to distinguish their aircraft from those flying for the Vichy French Air Force. Lysanders were mostly employed on reconnaissance missions, but were also used to carry out occasional attacks. In all, 24 Lysanders were used by the FAFL.

===Canada===
One hundred and four British-built Lysanders were delivered to Canada supplementing 225 that were built under licence by National Steel Car at Malton, Ontario (near Toronto) with production starting in October 1938 and the first aircraft flying in August 1939. The RCAF primarily operated Lysanders in the Army Co-operation role, where they represented a major improvement over the antiquated Westland Wapiti which could trace its origins back to 1916. Initial training was conducted at RCAF Station Rockcliffe (near Ottawa, Ontario) with No. 123 Squadron running an army co-operation school there. Units that operated the Lysander for training in this role in Canada include 2 Squadron, 110 Squadron (which became 400 Squadron overseas) and No. 112 Squadron RCAF.

414 squadron formed overseas and joined 110 Squadron and 112 Squadron with Lysanders. Prior to going overseas 2 Squadron was disbanded and its airmen reassigned to 110 and 112 Squadrons to bring them up to war establishment (2 Squadron would later reform in England as a Hurricane unit and eventually be renumbered as 402 Squadron). In all there were three squadrons ready to begin operations against the Axis Powers. Although Operation Sea Lion – the planned German invasion of Great Britain – was averted by the British victory in the Battle of Britain in 1940, the high losses suffered by RAF Lysanders in the Battle of France resulted in any plans for cross-channel offensive operations by Lysanders stopped, although the Canadian squadrons continued training with the Lysanders until suitable replacements were available.

No. 118 Squadron and No. 122 Squadron RCAF were the only Canadian units to use their Lysanders on active-duty operations – 118 in Saint John, New Brunswick, and 122 at various locations on Vancouver Island, where they performed anti-submarine patrols and conducted search-and-rescue operations. During the same period, No. 121 Squadron RCAF and several Operational Training Units (OTUs) used Lysanders – painted in a high-visibility yellow-and-black-striped scheme – for target towing duties.

For a brief period in 1940 when every available Hurricane fighter had been sent overseas to fight in the Battle of Britain, leaving the RCAF without a modern fighter aircraft at home in Canada, two RCAF Lysander-equipped squadrons which were supposed to convert to fighter aircraft but had none to convert to were re-designated as operational fighter squadrons. 111 Squadron, a coastal artillery squadron which earlier had replaced its Avro trainers with Lysanders and been reclassified as an army co-operation unit, was again reclassified as a fighter squadron – the only one on the Canadian west coast – in June 1940. Lysander-equipped 118 Squadron was also converted to a fighter squadron. The Lysander completely lacked the capability to operate in a fighter role, and neither squadron saw action as a fighter unit while equipped with Lysanders, but their designation as fighter squadrons did allow RCAF fighter pilots to work up at a critical time without having to wait for the arrival of true fighter aircraft. No. 118 Squadron was disbanded in September 1940, and when it reformed in December 1940, still as a fighter squadron, it was equipped with 15 old, otherwise unwanted Grumman Goblin fighters produced by Canadian Car and Foundry. Both 111 and 118 Squadrons soon re-equipped with the Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk, bringing the brief service of Lysanders in fighter squadrons to an end. By late 1944 all Canadian Lysanders had been withdrawn from flying duties.

===Other countries===

Other export customers for the Lysander included the Finnish Air Force (which received four Mk.I and nine Mk.III aircraft), the Irish Air Corps (which took delivery of six Mk.II aircraft), the Turkish Air Force (which received 36 Mk.IIs), the Portuguese Air Force (which took delivery of eight Mk.IIIA aircraft), the United States Army Air Forces (which received 25), the Indian Air Force (which took delivery of 22) and No. 1 Squadron of the Royal Egyptian Air Force. The REAF received 20 aircraft. Egyptian Lysanders were the last to see active service, against Israel in the 1947–1949 Palestine war.

===Civilian use===
After the war a number of surplus ex-Royal Canadian Air Force Lysanders were employed as aerial applicators with Westland Dusting Service, operating in Alberta and western Canada. Two of these were saved for inclusion in Lynn Garrison&#x27;s collection for display in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

==Production==
A total of 1,786 Lysanders were built, including 225 manufactured under licence by National Steel Car in Malton near Toronto, Ontario, Canada during 1938 and 1939.

;P.12 Delanne Lysander
:The P.12, also sometimes referred to as the Lysander Mk.V or Wendover, was a rebuild of the prototype Lysander &quot;K6127&quot; with a Delanne configuration tandem rear wing to carry a four-gun power-operated tail gun turret. The design was intended for &quot;beach strafing&quot; in case of invasion of the UK. The installation of a dorsal (Boulton Paul) gun turret had been mocked up but the movement of the centre of gravity aft was a concern which led to the investigation of the use of a Delanne tailplane which would provide 50% of the lift and allow for wide C-of-G range. Petter and Harald Penrose consulted Maurice Delanne, and Penrose flew the Delanne 20T in spring 1940 after which Petter drew up a design. The rear fuselage was altered into a wider one of constant cross section. Mounted low on the fuselage was the tail surface with twin tail fins replacing the central fin. This left room for a gun turret just aft of the rear wing. Both Frazer Nash and Boulton-Paul turrets were considered but only a ballasted dummy with no power system was installed. The main wing and forward fuselage remained unchanged. Trials did not start until July 1941 and by the time A&amp;AEE evaluation was complete the need for a breach-strafer had disappeared.
;&quot;Pregnant Perch&quot;
:&quot;L6473&quot; adapted with a ventral gun position, resulting in a bulged fuselage belly, again for beach strafing. During testing in June 1940 an engine failure led to a force landing and the aircraft ended up &quot;with its nose in a ditch&quot;. In 1940 &quot;K6127&quot; was tested with a pair of Oerlikon cannon mounted on top of the wheel fairings and the stub wings removed; the intention was to use the aircraft against invasion barges in Operation Sealion.

==Surviving aircraft==
A number of Lysanders are preserved in museums in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Belgium, and elsewhere.
* Lysander IIIA on static display at the Indian Air Force Museum in Palam, Delhi. Formerly RCAF 1589, it is painted in spurious colours. It is possible that this is the one that Canada traded for a B-24 Liberator bomber in the late 1960s.
* RCAF 2349 – Lysander III on display at the Canadian Museum of Flight in Langley, British Columbia. It is displayed without most of its fabric covering. This one was restored for Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia. The wings came from Cliff Douglas in Coutenay, B.C. The fuselage was found in the Prairies. The first fuselage was destroyed en route to British Columbia in a vehicle accident and another one was obtained.
* RCAF 2363 – Lysander IIIA under restoration to airworthy condition at the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton, Ontario. It flew for the first time following its restoration a few weeks before the museum&#x27;s Flyfest on 20–21 June 2009. It is finished in a yellow &amp; black &#x27;bumblebee&#x27; target tug scheme.
* RCAF 2365 – Lysander IIIA airworthy at the Vintage Wings of Canada in Gatineau, Quebec. It is painted in No. 400 &quot;City of Toronto&quot; RCAF Squadron markings, and is doped silver overall with RCAF serial number 416. After a full restoration, it first flew 18 June 2010 in Gatineau, QC.
* RCAF 2442 – Lysander III under restoration to airworthy condition with Sabena Old Timers in Zaventem, Belgium.
* RCAF 2445 – Lysander IIIA in storage at the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in Wetaskiwin, Alberta.
* T1562 or V9562 – Lysander TT III on static display at the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History in Brussels. Previously registered as OO-SOP, it was restored from 1983 to 1988, and again by December 2010 following a forced landing.
* R9125 – Lysander III on static display at the Royal Air Force Museum London. It is painted in the early war brown and green temperate land scheme marked JR-M R9125 of No. 225 Squadron RAF.
* V9552 – Airworthy as of 2019 as part of The Shuttleworth Collection, Old Warden, Bedfordshire in the UK. It is currently painted in the all black scheme of the clandestine Special Duties aircraft of No.161 Squadron RAF, bearing the serial &quot;V9367&quot; (flown by Pilot Officer Peter Vaughan-Fowler, DSO, DFC and bar, AFC.)
* V9312 – Airworthy as of 2019 following restoration to flight by the Aircraft Restoration Company at Imperial War Museum Duxford. Flew in August 2018 for the first time since 1944. A Westland-built example, manufactured in 1940. Currently painted in the livery of No. 225 squadron RAF, with whom the plane served in wartime. Apparently now in the process of being certified to carry paying passengers.
* Lysander III on static display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, Ontario. This example was a composite, restored from three aircraft by the RCAF as a centennial project in 1967 and is painted in the early war temperate land scheme (dark earth and dark green over sky).
* RCAF 2346 – Lysander IIIA on static display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia. It is painted in a night finish with grey and green topsides, and marked as AC-B &quot;N7791&quot;, a No. 138 Squadron RAF aircraft famous for spy-dropping missions in wartime Europe.

<text>The 7th Carrier Air Group (7th CAG) was an aircraft carrier air group of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. It was formed in June 1945, at HMS &quot;Nabthorpe&quot;, a Royal Navy Mobile Operatioral Naval Air Base (MONAB) at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base RAAF Station Schofields at Schofields, New South Wales, in Australia. The group was initially embarked in .

== Naval Air Squadrons ==
The 7th Carrier Air Group consisted of a number of squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm.
== History ==

The squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm, embarked in the Royal Navy’s Fleet and Light Fleet aircraft carriers, were organized into Air Groups in alignment with United States Navy policy following the conclusion of World War II in Europe. This reorganisation aimed to facilitate operations in the Pacific Theater against Japanese forces in 1945.

=== 1945 - 1946 ===

The 7th Carrier Air Group was formed on 30 June 1945, HMS &quot;Nabthorpe&quot;, located at Schofields, in Australia. The 7th CAG was assigned to the , for service in the British Pacific Fleet. It was made up of 820 Naval Air Squadron, which operated Grumman Avenger, an American torpedo bomber aircraft, 1770 Naval Air Squadron which flew Fairey Firefly, a carrier-borne fighter and anti-submarine aircraft and the squadrons from the 24th Naval Fighter Wing: 887 Naval Air Squadron and 894 Naval Air Squadron, both of which were equipped with Supermarine Seafire, a navalised version of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft. 1770 Naval Air Squadron left after one month in the July, and 1772 Naval Air Squadron took its place in the group.

The air groups squadrons embarked on &quot;Indefatigable&quot; on the 7 July and the carrier sailed for Manus. The coast of Japan was reached on 20 July and the air group aircraft began attacking targets near Osaka and in the Inland Sea, four days later. Large external fuel tanks were now used by the CAG&#x27;s Supermarine Seafire aircraft, therefore, were now no longer limited to combat air patrol due to restricted range.

At the end of July, a combination of poor weather, refuelling, along with the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, meant any air operations were paused until the 9 August. During the day, the Carrier Air Group&#x27;s aircraft attacked targets in northern Honshu and southern Hokkaido, with the attacks repeated the following day.

A large part of the British Pacific Fleet withdrew on the 12 August, however, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and the group remained as part of an occupation force and the group and was involved in strikes around Tokyo just before VJ-Day. On the 15 August, the Carrier Air Group was targeting Kisarazu Air Field, but poor weather meant it had to instead attack a secondary target. The group was then attacked by a number of Mitsubishi A6M Zero aircraft, in the last British air combat of the war. The Japanese fighters shot down one Supermarine Seafire on their first pass and crippled a Grumman Avenger.

Sub Lieutenant Fred Hockley was leading five Supermarine Seafire aircraft from 894 Naval Air Squadron which was tasked, along with three 887 Naval Air Squadron Supermarine Seafire aircraft, led by Sub Lieutenant Victor Lowden, with defending Fairey Firefly and Grumman Avenger fighter bomber aircraft within the CAG. The target changed to a chemical factory at Odaki Bay, south of Tokyo, and the formation was attacked from behind by a number of Mitsubishi Zero aircraft.

Hockley&#x27;s radio had failed, therefore, did not hear any warning call and as lead aircraft, was unable to see his formation break. His aircraft was hit and he bailed out of his Supermarine Seafire. Fred Hockley surrendered, however, he was executed by Japanese forces after capture.

An 887 Naval Air Squadron Supermarine Seafire aircraft, serial number NN212, Fleet Air Arm coded &quot;112/S&quot; and flown by Sub Lieutenant G.J. Murphy, RN, shot down two Japanese Mitsubishi Zeros. By the end of the engagement, the Supermarine Seafire aircraft pilots had claimed four Mitsubishi Zeros shot down, four others probably shot down, and another four damaged. A Grumman Avenger crew also claimed one Mitsubishi Zero as damaged.

The 7th Carrier Air Group lost one Supermarine Seafire aircraft and one Grumman Avenger aircraft. The damaged Grumman Avenger deliberately ditched next to a destroyer on the return journey. Victor Lowden was the last to land his Supermarine Seafire on the return to &quot;Indefatigable&quot;. He was credited with two Mitsubishi Zero aircraft destroyed, one shared and two damaged. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions over Tokyo Bay.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot;&#x27;s air group continued to fly Combat Air Patrols (CAP) and also flew reconnaissance missions looking for Allied prisoners of war, dropping supplies to them as they were located. The flying operations continued until the group entered Sagami Bay on 5 September. They departed three days later for Australia, where the aircraft carrier had a refit, before returning to the United Kingdom, via New Zealand, Australia again and also South Africa. The aircraft carrier and its air group arrived at Portsmouth Dockyard on the 16 March 1946. The 7th Carrier Air Group disbanded on 23 March 1946.

===1950 - 1951 ===

On the 7 December 1950, the group reformed, but was known as the 7th Night Air Group. It was assigned to the light aircraft carrier, and was made up of 809 Naval Air Squadron, which operated de Havilland Hornet, a twin-engine fighter aircraft, and 814 Naval Air Squadron, which was equipped with Fairey Firefly, a carrier-borne fighter and anti-submarine aircraft.

814 Naval Air Squadron was awarded the Boyd Trophy for its high standard of operational efficiency, night flying with the Fairey Firefly aircraft whilst deployed onboard &quot;Vengeance&quot;, in 1951.

The night air group approach was deemed unsuccessful, only lasting for six months. The group disbanded on the 1 June 1951.

<text>The 8th Carrier Air Group (8th CAG) was an aircraft carrier air group of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. It was formed in June 1945, for service in the British Pacific Fleet, until disbanding the following year, in April 1946. The group was embarked on (R86).

== Naval Air Squadrons ==
The 8th Carrier Air Group consisted of a number of squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm.
== History ==

=== 1945 - 1946 ===
The 8th Carrier Air Group of the Fleet Air Arm was formed on 30 June 1945, for the name ship of her class, the aircraft carrier , for service in the British Pacific Fleet. It was made up of 828 Naval Air Squadron which operated the Grumman TBF Avenger, an American torpedo bomber, 801 Naval Air Squadron and 880 Naval Air Squadron, which were equipped with Supermarine Seafire, a navalised Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft, and 1771 Naval Air Squadron which flew the Fairey Firefly, a carrier-borne fighter and anti-submarine aircraft.

The group flew off eight Fairey Firefly and a dozen Supermarine Seafire aircraft, from HMS &quot;Implacable&quot;, against targets north of Tokyo on 17 July, however, due to bad weather only the Fairey Firefly were able to locate their targets. Eight Fairey Firefly and twenty Supermarine Seafire aircraft attacked targets near Tokyo the following day, however, more bad weather halted flying operations. On the 24–25 July, Fleet Air Arm aircraft resumed attacks, crippling the escort carrier .

With the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and more bad weather, the group was unable to operate between the end of July and the 9 August. However, on that day, the CAG flew 94 x Supermarine Seafire sorties and flew 14 x Fairey Firefly sorties off HMS &quot;Implacable&quot;, against targets in northern Honshu and southern Hokkaido, with the loss of two Supermarine Seafire aircraft. On the 10 August, the sorties continued, sinking two warships, various small merchantmen and destroying railroad locomotives and dispersed aircraft. The CAG aircraft flew over 1,000 sorties since their arrival, the previous month.

In September 1945, 880 Naval Air Squadron was absorbed by 801 Naval Air Squadron, and also 1771 Naval Air Squadron disbanded. The 8th Carrier Air Group was disbanded in April 1946.

<text>The 14th Carrier Air Group (14th CAG) was an aircraft carrier air group of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. It was initially formed in June 1945, for service in the British Pacific Fleet, until disbanding in July 1946. The group was embarked on (R15).

The 14th CAG reformed in October 1946, at RNAS Eglinton (HMS Gannet), in Northern Ireland, for embarkation on (R64), until disbanding in December 1947.

It reformed a second time, in January 1948, operating in the Mediterranean and then seeing action in Korea, before disbanding a third time in May 1952.

== Naval Air Squadrons ==
The 14th Carrier Air Group consisted of a number of squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm.
== History ==

=== 1945 - 1946 ===

The 14th Carrier Air Group was formed on 30 June 1945. It was based on the light aircraft carrier, , the name-ship of the s, for service in the British Pacific Fleet. The group initially contained 827 Naval Air Squadron flying the Fairey Barracuda, a British carrier-borne torpedo and dive bomber aircraft, and 1846 Naval Air Squadron flying the Vought Corsair, an American fighter aircraft. The group disbanded, when &quot;Colossus&quot; arrived back home, on 23 July 1946.

=== 1946 - 1947 ===

The 14th Carrier Air Group reformed, on 1 October 1946 at RNAS Eglinton (HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;), located north east of Eglinton, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, this time for the , , deployed as the Flagship, for the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron in the British Pacific Fleet, with 804 and 812 Naval Air Squadrons. 804 Naval Air Squadron operated the Supermarine Seafire, a naval version of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft, adapted for operation from an aircraft carrier. 812 Naval Air Squadron was equipped with Fairey Firefly, a carrier-borne fighter and anti-submarine aircraft. The group disbanded, when &quot;Theseus&quot; arrived back in the United Kingdom, on 21 December 1947.

=== 1948 - 1952 ===
The 14th Carrier Air Group reformed, on 15 January 1948, at RNAS Ford (HMS &quot;Peregrine&quot;),located at Ford, in West Sussex, England. The group was for the light fleet aircraft carrier, (R68). It was made up of 802 and 814 Naval Air Squadrons again, the difference however, was that while both squadrons operated with the same aircraft, they now used later variants. The 14th CAG moved to RNAS Donibristle (HMS &quot;Merlin&quot;), located east of Rosyth, Fife, and RNAS Eglinton (HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;), located north east of Eglinton, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, before emabarking on &quot;Ocean&quot;, on the 24 August 1948, then arriving at RNAS Hal Far (HMS &quot;Falcon&quot;), on Malta, on the 1 September 1948.

In July 1949, 804 NAS swapped it&#x27;s Supermarine Seafire aircraft for Hawker Sea Fury, a British Naval fighter-bomber aircraft, and 812 NAS received the FR.Mk 5 variant of the Fairey Firefly. Four Fairey Firefly NF.Mk I &quot;night fighter&quot; variant aircraft were also received, enabling the squadron to form Black Flight, which became known as the 14th CAG Night Fighter unit. In November 1949, the CAG transferred over to another aircraft carrier, (R62).

Aboard &quot;Glory&quot;, the CAG deployed to the Far East as the Korean War was now taking place. From April 1951 &quot;Glory&quot; and the 14th CAG, undertook a tour of nine, nine day patrols, off the West coast of North Korea. The aircraft carrier departed to Australia for a refit, but was back by February 1952, to undertake five more patrols, before returning home.

The 14th Carrier Air Group spent 316 days on patrols, during its time operating in the Korean War, amassing ~9,500 operational sorties. It disbanded, upon returning home to the United Kingdom, on the 2 May 1952.

<text>The 15th Carrier Air Group (15th CAG) was an aircraft carrier air group of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm. It was initially formed in June 1945, for service in the British Pacific Fleet, until disbanding in March 1947. The group was embarked on the , (R63).

The 15th CAG reformed in May 1947, at RNAS Eglinton (HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;), in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, for embarkation on another &quot;Colossus&quot;-class aircraft carrier, (R71). In late 1951 the group was deployed on (R64), a &quot;Colossus&quot;-class aircraft carrier. The 15th Carrier Air Group disbanded in January 1952, at RNAS Culdrose (HMS &quot;Seahawk&quot;), in Cornwall, England.

== Naval Air Squadrons ==
The 15th Carrier Air Group consisted of a number of squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm.
== History ==

=== 1945 - 1947 ===

The 15th Carrier Air Group was formed on 30 June 1945 and was based on the light aircraft carrier, (R63), a &quot;Colossus&quot;-class aircraft carrier. The group initially consisted 814 Naval Air Squadron, flying the Fairey Barracuda, a carrier-borne torpedo and dive bomber aircraft, and 1851 Naval Air Squadron, flying the Vought F4U Corsair, an American fighter aircraft. 814 NAS replaced its Fairey Barracuda with Fairey Firefly, a carrier-borne fighter aircraft, in December 1945. Then, in June 1946 1851 NAS transferred to another &quot;Colossus&quot;-class aircraft carrier, (R71), and 802 Naval Air Squadron replaced it in the CAG, bringing its Supermarine Seafire aircraft, a navalised version of the Supermarine Spitfire fighter. The 15th CAG was disbanded in 1947.

=== 1947 - 1952 ===

The 15th Carrier Air Group reformed on 16 May 1947 at RNAS Eglinton (HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;), located north east of Eglinton, in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland, this time for the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class aircraft carrier, (R71), with 802 and 814 Naval Air Squadrons. Here, 802 NAS replaced its Supermarine Seafire aircraft with Hawker Sea Fury fighter aircraft. In April 1950, 802 NAS left the group and was replaced with 809 Naval Air Squadron, which brought with it de Havilland Sea Hornet twin-engined fighter aircraft, however, in the following September, 802 NAS returned and 809 NAS left the group.

In November 1950, only 802 NAS remained in the group as 814 NAS departed. It wasn&#x27;t until June 1951 that the group was back to initial strength, when 825 Naval Air Squadron arrIves, which operated Fairey Firefly aircraft. However, 825 NAS only stayed for around three months and left in September 1951. It was replaced with 814 NAS, which re-joined the 15th CAG and the group embarked on another &quot;Colossus&quot;-class aircraft carrier, (R64). The 15th Carrier Air Group disbanded on 15 January 1952, at RNAS Culdrose (HMS &quot;Seahawk&quot;) in Cornwall, England.

<text>Hip-hop fashion (also known as rap fashion) refers to the various styles of dress that originated from Urban Black America and inner city youth in cities like New York City, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Being a major part of hip-hop culture, it further developed in other cities across the United States, with each contributing different elements to the overall style that is now recognized worldwide.

== History ==

=== Late 1970s to mid-1980s ===
During the late 1970s, sportswear and fashion brands such as Le Coq Sportif, Kangol, Adidas and Pro-Keds became established and attached themselves to the emerging hip-hop scene.

In the 1980s, hip-hop DJs were known for wearing brightly colored name-brand tracksuits, sheepskin and leather bomber jackets, backpiece jackets, Clarks shoes, Britishers (also known as British walkers) and sneakers. DJs would wear sneakers from brands such as Pro-Keds, Puma, Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars and Adidas Superstars often with oversized or &quot;phat&quot; shoelaces. Popular haircuts of the time ranged from the early-1980s Jheri curl to the early-1990s hi-top fade, which was popularized by Will Smith (The Fresh Prince) and Christopher &quot;Kid&quot; Reid of Kid &#x27;n Play, among others. Another trend in hip-hop clothing, pioneered by Dapper Dan in the early 1980s, was the adaptation and brandishing of high-net-worth fashion house brands such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Gucci and logos on custom-designed tracksuits, jackets, and mink coats.

Trending accessories of the time included items such as large eyeglasses (Cazals), Kangol bucket hats, nameplates, name belts, multiple rings and heavy gold jewelry. Men&#x27;s jewelry typically focused on heavy gold chains, while women&#x27;s jewelry consisted of large gold earrings. Hip-hop performers like Kurtis Blow and Big Daddy Kane helped popularize gold necklaces and other types of jewelry, while female rappers such as Roxanne Shanté and the group Salt-N-Pepa helped popularize made oversized gold door-knocker earrings trend. The heavy jewelry was seen as a symbol of prestige and wealth, and some even connected the style to Africanism. For instance, MC Schoolly D claimed that wearing gold &quot;is not something that was born and raised in America. In the rap genre, artists would engage in battles. As the leading warriors, we must rise and proudly proclaim our victories, while also sharing the methods that helped us achieve them.&quot;

The fashion of 1980s hip-hop is widely regarded as one of the key components of the old-school hip-hop culture. It is often celebrated in nostalgic hip-hop tracks such as Ahmad&#x27;s 1994 single &quot;Back in the Day&quot; and Missy Elliott&#x27;s 2002 song of the same name.

As per Gwendolyn O&#x27;Neal, author of &quot;African American Aesthetics of Dress&quot; (1997), &quot;The African-American aesthetic of dress is not exclusively African or American, but rather is influenced by distinct &#x27;cultural&#x27; experiences that stem from being of African ancestry and living in America.&quot; In an interview with Black Book Magazine, rapper Jay-Z supported this view and defended the preference for luxury fashion brands in hip-hop culture as a way of &quot;living on our own terms, rather than trying to imitate an elite lifestyle.&quot; The use of high-end fashion products in the hip-hop lifestyle is not necessarily driven by conspicuous consumption.

==== Preppy ====
In the 1980s, the first wave of hip-hop influence, preppy fashion also gained popularity among the youth. This group of young, upwardly mobile black individuals, known as &quot;buppies&quot;, embraced 1980s hip-hop music and wore clothing items from brands like Polo, Timberland, and Tommy Hilfiger. They were particularly drawn to the exclusivity and aspirational appeal of Hilfiger, with its all-American, WASP-y, and country club aesthetic. The brand&#x27;s immense popularity among the hip-hop subculture community eventually led to its global expansion.

=== Late 1980s to early 1990s ===
Black nationalism was increasingly influential in rap during the late 1980s, and fashions and hairstyles reflected traditional African influences. Blousy pants were popular among dance-oriented rappers like M.C. Hammer. Fezzes, kufis decorated with the Kemetic ankh, Kente cloth hats, Africa chains, dreadlocks, and Black Nationalist colors of red, black, and green became popular as well, promoted by artists such as Queen Latifah, KRS-One, Public Enemy, Native Tongues and X-Clan.

In the 1990s, hip-hop fashion underwent a gradual evolution from the 1980s, as the community began to draw inspiration from traditional African-American dress. The style of dressing in the early 1990s was influenced by elements such as bright colors, oversized pants, and headwear. The character portrayed by Will Smith in &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; serves as a notable example of the classic style and fashion trends of the 1990s. He is consistently dressed in bright and colorful garments, throwback jerseys, and baseball caps. Similarly, rappers such as Kid &#x27;n Play and Left Eye of TLC also popularized the use of bright-colored clothing and baseball caps. Among women, TLC and the late R&amp;B singer Aaliyah created a fashion trend by pairing baggy pants with crop tops or sports bras, and occasionally adding an oversized flannel shirt to their looks. This style represented their own version of femininity and conveyed the idea that not everything needs to be form-fitting and tight in order to be considered sexy.

Kris Kross established the fad of wearing clothes backwards.

Kwamé sparked a brief trend of polka-dot clothing.

In 1984, Nike collaborated with Michael Jordan to create the well-known basketball shoes, the Air Jordans. Even though the price point ranged from US$100 (which was considered a high price point then), it did not stop people from lining up for hours just to get their hands on a pair of these shoes. To date, Air Jordans are still widely worn by basketball players, and with Nike releasing retro versions from time to time, which sell out globally within minutes of the release date. Adidas had a large role in sneaker culture, helped by Run-DMC when the group&#x27;s single &quot;My Adidas&quot; released in 1986. Other clothing brands such as Reebok, Kangol, Fila, Champion, Carhartt, and Timberland were closely associated with the hip hop scene, particularly on the East coast with hip hop acts such as the Wu-Tang Clan and Gang Starr sporting the look.

Gangsta rap pioneers N.W.A popularized an early form of street style in the late 1980s from the African American gangs and hustler cliques who were there mimicking cholo fashion. This included khaki Dickies work pants, white T-shirts, Locs sunglasses, Air Jordan or Nike Cortez sneakers, with black Los Angeles Raiders or Kings snapback hats and Starter jackets. These jackets were also a popular trend in their own right in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They became something of a status symbol, with incidents of robberies of the jackets reported in the media.

Hip hop fashion in this period also influenced high fashion designs. In the late 1980s, Isaac Mizrahi, inspired by his elevator operator who wore a heavy gold chain, showed a collection deeply influenced by hip hop fashion. Models wore black catsuits, &quot;gold chains, big gold nameplate-inspired belts, and black bomber jackets with fur-trimmed hoods.&quot; &quot;Womenswear Daily&quot; called the look &quot;homeboy chic&quot;. In the early 1990s, Chanel showed hip hop-inspired fashion in several shows. In one, models wore black leather jackets and piles of gold chains. In another, they wore long black dresses accessorized with heavy, padlocked silver chains. (These silver chains were remarkably similar to the metal chain-link and padlock worn by Treach of Naughty by Nature, who said he did so in solidarity with &quot;all the brothers who are locked down.&quot;)

The eight-ball jacket, created by designer Michael Hoban in 1990, was trendy during the 1990s, particularly in the East Coast hip hop scene of New York City. The style is characterized by bright color-blocking and large black and white decals on the back and sleeves, made to look like the eight ball used in some cue sports.

=== Mid 1990s to late 2000s ===
==== Fashion among &quot;hip hop&quot; elites ====
On the East Coast of the United States, members of the hip hop community looked back to the gangsters of the 1930s and 1940s for inspiration. Mafioso influences, especially and primarily inspired by the 1983 remake version of &quot;Scarface&quot;, became popular in hip hop. Many rappers set aside gang-inspired clothing in favor of classic gangster fashions such as bowler hats, double-breasted suits, silk shirts, and alligator-skin shoes (&quot;gators&quot;).

This look transcended into the R&amp;B world in the mid-1990s when Jodeci came onto the scene, who were crooners but with a more edgy and sexual look. By wearing gangster-style clothes along with the bad-boy attitude and being a R&amp;B group, they appealed to both men and women. They were particularly known for their baggy clothing, symbolizing a hand-me-down from an older relative with a bigger build, as a sign of toughness.

On the East Coast, &quot;ghetto fabulous&quot; fashion (a term coined by Sean Combs) was on the rise.

==== Urban streetwear ====

Tommy Hilfiger was one of the most prominent brands in 1990s sportswear, though Polo Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, Nautica, and DKNY were also popular. Snoop Dogg wore a striped Hilfiger rugby shirt during an appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and it sold out of New York City stores the next day. Furthermore, Tommy Hilfiger tube tops were also a big hit within the hip-hop community. It was considered a &quot;must-have&quot; piece for every girl influenced by this music genre. Artists like TLC, the late Aaliyah and so on were commonly seen in events dressed in it. Hilfiger&#x27;s popularity was due to its perceived waspiness, which made it seem exclusive and aspirational. Hilfiger courted the new hip hop market: black models featured prominently in the company&#x27;s advertising campaigns, and rappers like Puffy and Coolio walked during its runways shows. As of late, Tommy Hilfiger launched People&#x27;s Place, a program designed to amplify the brand&#x27;s efforts and dedication to increasing opportunities in fashion for underrepresented communities.

Karl Kani was another influential designer who merged hip hop with fashion.

Other brands, such as Nike, Jordan, FUBU, Southpole, Reebok Pro-Keds, Adidas, Eckō Unltd., Walker Wear, Mecca USA, Lugz, Rocawear, Boss Jeans by IG Design, and Enyce, arose to capitalize on the market for urban streetwear.

==== Throwback clothing ====


One sportswear trend that emerged was the rise in popularity of throwback jerseys, such as those produced by Mitchell &amp; Ness. Sports jerseys have always been popular in hip hop fashion, as evidenced by Will Smith&#x27;s early 1990s video &quot;Summertime&quot;, and Spike Lee wearing a throwback Brooklyn Dodgers jersey in the film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;. The late 1990s saw the rise in popularity of very expensive throwbacks, often costing hundreds of dollars. Hip hop artists donning the pricey jerseys in music videos led to increased demand, and led to the rise of counterfeiters flooding the market with fake jerseys to capitalize on the craze. The mid-to-late 2000s saw a decrease in popularity of throwbacks, with some hip hop artists even shunning them.

The &quot;hip-pop&quot; era also saw the split between male and female hip hop fashion, which had previously been more or less similar. Women in hip hop had emulated the male tough-guy fashions such as baggy pants, &quot;Loc&quot; sunglasses, tough looks and heavy workboats; many, such as Da Brat, accomplished this with little more than some lip gloss and a bit of make-up to make the industrial work pants and work boots feminine. The female performers who completely turned the tide, such as Lil&#x27; Kim and Foxy Brown, popularized glamorous, high-fashion feminine hip hop styles, such as Kimora Lee Simmons&#x27; fashion line of Baby Phat. Lauryn Hill and Eve popularized more conservative styles that still maintained both a distinctly feminine and distinctly hip hop feel.

==== Bling ====
In the mid-to-late 1990s, platinum replaced gold as the metal of choice in hip hop fashion. Artists and fans alike wore platinum (or silver-colored) jewelry, often embedded with diamonds. Juvenile and The Hot Boys were largely responsible for this trend. Platinum fronts also became popular; Cash Money Records executive/rapper Brian &quot;Baby&quot; Williams has an entire mouthful of permanent platinum teeth. Others have fashioned grills, removable metal jeweled teeth coverings.

With the advent of the jewelry culture, the turn-of-the-century-established luxury brands made inroads into the hip hop market, with brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton and 212 Diamond City making appearances in hip hop videos and films.

=== Modern (2000s–2020s) ===

Hip-hop fashion from the 1980s to 2011 has undergone numerous changes, with new trends emerging and old trends resurfacing. Some of the most popular styles during this period include snapbacks, sportswear, basketball and skateboarding shoes, hoodies, piercings in one or both ears, leather jackets, sleeveless shirts, polo shirts, baggy pants, bikini tops, crop tops, tube tops, tank tops, factory tracksuits, and cropped T-shirts. These items of clothing have become iconic in hip-hop culture, with many artists and fans incorporating them into their personal style.

==== Streetwear ====

In the 1990s and beyond, many hip hop artists and executives started their own fashion labels and clothing lines. Notable examples include Wu-Tang Clan (Wu-Wear), Pharrell (Billionaire Boys Club/Ice Cream), Nelly (Vokal and Apple Bottom Jeans), Russell Simmons (Phat Farm), Kimora Lee Simmons (Baby Phat), Diddy (Sean John and Enyce), T.I. (AKOO), Damon Dash and Jay-Z (Rocawear), 50 Cent (G-Unit Clothing), Eminem (Shady Limited), 2Pac (Makaveli Branded), OutKast (OutKast Clothing), Lil Wayne (Trukfit), Young Thug (Sp5der), and Kanye West (Yeezy).

Up-and-coming urban clothing lines have dominated the fashion in the hip hop genre. Skinny jeans also came into style in part due to New Boyz&#x27; jerk dance from the song &quot;You&#x27;re a Jerk&quot;.

The resurgence of Adidas track jackets and the incorporation of fashion scarves are some of the latest trends to emerge in hip hop fashion. While Adidas tracksuits have been a part of hip hop culture since the commercialization of the genre, they have recently regained popularity.

Skateboarding fashion has been used in the hip hop scene since the early 2010s, including knit caps, bonnets, fitted pants or shorts, Vans, Nike SB (skateboarding), shirts with sleeves and printed Tees (brands like OBEY, Supreme, Stussy, Adidas, Supra, Circa, DC, RDS and Emericas). Chris Brown, Tyler, the Creator and Lil Wayne wear these in their music videos and concerts.

The rebirth of the 1990s snapback caps is the most notable sign of the new school throwback image. The &quot;new&quot; snapback hype started around mid-2010. Around late 2010 and early 2011, the &quot;new&quot; snapback movement exploded. Starter Clothing Line manufactured the most sought-after snapbacks in the 1990s, and made its return as the hype for the hats grew. Many other well-known hat companies started to sell snapbacks, such as New Era, Mitchell &amp; Ness, Reebok, and Adidas. Many notable artists are credited with the comeback of snapbacks by sporting gear from a company named Ti$A VI$ION. Chris Brown, Tyga, and Big Sean were among the early supporters of this company since 2010. Many urban fashionistas credit Mac Miller, a well-known YouTube MC, with starting the hype with the release of his song entitled &quot;Snap Back&quot;, from the mixtape &quot;The Jukebox: Prelude to Class Clown&quot;, released in June 2009. There is controversy as to who started the &quot;new&quot; snapback trend.

Skater culture is also prominent in the Hip-Hop scene. The boost in its popularity is largely attributed to alternative rapper and leader of the musical group Odd Future, Tyler, The Creator. Brands like Obey, Supreme, Thrasher, and Tyler, the Creator&#x27;s merchandise line, Golf Wang have also boosted the significance of skater fashion in Hip-Hop.

==== Designer clothing ====
The hip hop fashion trends of the 2000s were all over the place and changed constantly, starting with the baller-type image. Michael Jordan&#x27;s cover on &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; was significant in hip-hop fashion because he was able to influence millions of people into the direction of baggy shorts, baggy tops, and gold chains. There have been other celebrity influences among fashion trends, with most of these influences coming from hip hop artists. Gucci and Louis Vuitton became extremely popular among the hip hop/urban community from the use of the words, &quot;Gucci&quot; and &quot;Louis&quot; in lyrics and music videos.

During this time period, many fashion trends from the 1980s and early 1990s experienced a resurgence in popularity. For example, door knocker earrings and form-fitting jeans for men came back into style. Cartoon graphic print hoodies by Bathing Ape, as popularized by artist and producer Pharrell, also gained popularity. Women continued to wear high heels in various forms, and new shoe styles emerged, such as the open-toed boot.

Around 2012, fashion in hip hop saw a shift towards modern &quot;high&quot; streetwear and haute couture brands popularized by online fashion forums such as Superfuture and Styleforum. Brands such as Rick Owens, Raf Simons, and Saint Laurent Paris are now featured prominently in the lyrics and wardrobes of rappers such as A$AP Rocky, Travis Scott, and Kanye West.
==== Tattoos ====
In recent years, the hip hop world has seen a resurgence of old fads as well as the emergence of new ones. The last few years of the first decade of the new millennia gave rise to the popularity of tattoos covering artists from head to toe. Soulja Boy, Wiz Khalifa, Lil Wayne and Tyga have set the trend of being completely &quot;tatted up.&quot; Birdman now sports a star tattoo on the crown of his head, Gucci Mane has an ice cream tattoo on his right cheek, and Lil Wayne has tattoos on his eyelids and forehead.

==== Women&#x27;s hair ====
When discussing fashion trends, one cannot overlook the significance of hairstyles, particularly for women. In recent years, there has been a revival of the asymmetrical haircut with a modern twist. Celebrities like Rihanna, Cassie, and Kelis have all helped popularize the trend of the half-shaven head.

==== Face coverings ====
Fashion scarves have also gained popularity in recent years. Kanye West is one of the latest artists to launch his own line of products, selling decorative scarves with provocative depictions under the name Risque Scarves. In the 2020s, balaclavas (known as &quot;shiesty masks&quot;) have become popular. The rapper Yeat has also popularized wearing distressed balaclavas and scarves tied as turbans.

==== Overlap with punk fashion ====
Around 2019, a fashion trend emerged coined as the &quot;Opium&quot; aesthetic, named after Playboi Carti&#x27;s record label. The label includes Ken Carson, Destroy Lonely, and Homixide Gang, although related acts such as &quot;Burberry Erry&quot; (Erik Artega), &quot;F1lthy, and &quot;Oji&quot; are also notable contributors to the punk-like aesthetic. The aesthetic and fashion trend focuses around dark monochrome, usually black clothing, Gothic structures, and high streetwear and avant-garde brands such as Balenciaga, Rick Owens, Vetements, Alyx, Undercover, and Chrome Hearts.

==== Glasses ====

In the mid 2010s to 2020s, luxury glasses made by French brand Cartier have surged in popularity, especially in the Michigan rap scene, but also outside of it. According to Detroit jeweler Tony Bahu, &quot;It started back in the 80s. They started making the main Cartier glasses in 1983, and Detroit came on the scene right away. It was a lot of Detroit auto money.&quot; Certain Cartier glasses (colloquially, &quot;buffs&quot;, &quot;yays&quot;, or &quot;white sticks&quot;) have been famous for having temples made out of buffalo horn and are widely considered as a status symbol because of their price. Cartier also makes glasses with temples out of metal (gold or silver) or wood, which are called &quot;wires&quot; and &quot;woods&quot;, respectively. In 2020, Detroit rapper Gmac Cash attempted to gift a pair of Cartiers to the Governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, but she denied the offer. Rappers such as Quavo, Big Sean, and Icewear Vezzo are known for their expensive Cartier sunglasses. The hinges and bridges of designer glasses are also typically &quot;iced&quot; with diamonds, which is part of hip-hop bling. Sports players in the Detroit Pistons and Michigan Wolverines have also worn Cartier glasses.

As a negative part of the trend, multiple robberies have occurred in Detroit and Washington, D.C. that were motivated by Cartier glasses.

Glasses made by Gucci, Balenciaga, Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Prada have also gained popularity.

The rapper Kanye West has also frequently worn shutter shades in the 2000s and 2010s, partially for their camp value, and shutter shades have become synonymous with Kanye West.

== Influence ==
As music played a significant role in the way people dressed during the 1990s, many celebrities were known as fashion icons, especially rappers. Legendary rapper, Tupac, was not only known for his resonating lyrics, but also his timeless style. He was seen as a trend setter during that period. His signature, classic style were bandanas paired with baggy overalls or Red Wings jersey. In return, he made bandanas into an iconic headwear accessory. Today, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s fashion influence has taught society to be more accepting of different styles and has inspired fashion designers from all over the world to be innovative in their designs. Furthermore, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s influence has taught people that confidence comes with pride, which is the key to feeling comfortable and looking good in your individual fashion style.

Moreover, hip hop has also adopted and then transformed traditional or &quot;old world&quot; luxury symbols and made them modern-day, &quot;cool&quot; commodities. Rapper LL Cool J wore a Kangol hat back in the 1980s, when few Americans knew anything about the European hat maker, but its association with hip hop would invigorate the brand. In 2003, London-based Kangol acknowledged the popularity given its sixty-year-old brand by a young LL Cool J in 1983.

== Criticism ==

Commentators from both inside and outside the hip hop community have criticized the cost of many of the accoutrements of hip hop fashion. Chuck D of Public Enemy summarized the mentality of hip hop fashion and some low-income youths as &quot;Man, I work at McDonald&#x27;s, but in order for me to feel good about myself I got to get a gold chain or I got to get a fly car in order to impress a sister or whatever.&quot; In his 1992 song &quot;Us&quot;, Ice Cube rapped that &quot;Us niggaz will always sing the blues / &#x27;cause all we care about is hairstyles and tennis shoes&quot;. Some fans have expressed disappointment with the increased amount of advertising for expensive hip hop brands in hip hop magazines. In one letter to the editor in &quot;Source&quot; magazine, a reader wrote that the magazine should &quot;try showing some less expensive brands so heads will know they don&#x27;t have to hustle, steal, or rob and blast shots for flyness.&quot; There were many highly publicized robberies of hip hop artists by the late 1990s; Guru of Gang Starr was robbed of his Rolex watch at gunpoint, Queen Latifah&#x27;s car was car-jacked, and Prodigy was robbed at gunpoint of $300,000 in jewelry.

Hip hop has sometimes come under fire for glorifying brands that shut it out and for embracing a fashion culture which does not embrace hip hop or black culture. A dichotomy exists in the &quot;collaboration&quot; between influential hip hop artists who embrace designer brands and fashions, and these same brands that profit from hip hop&#x27;s influencers. Designer brands such as Louis Vuitton or Versace align themselves with influential musicians because of the potential gains, but simultaneously maintain distance from these allies outside of advertising, &quot;almost as with a keen desire to hold the controlling hand in these relationships&quot; and control their public image. In these partnerships/collaborations between designers and artists there is sometimes a pattern of exploitation in which the designers benefit disproportionately more than hip hop artists.

A few hip-hop insiders, such as the members of Public Enemy, Immortal Technique, Paris and Common, have made the deliberate choice not to don expensive jewelry as a statement against materialism.

== Gender roles and dress ==
=== Women ===

Along with the turning of the tide by select female hip hop artists came the emergence of promoting sex appeal through fashion. Female artists have faced a number of pressures ranging from gaining exposure to further their careers as well as conforming with certain images to remain in demand and relevant. Female rappers in today&#x27;s time like Cardi B and Nicki Minaj are two of the most popular female rappers and still conform to this standard. The alignment of R&amp;B music with hip hop music (with collaborations being more and more prevalent) placed a whole new category of women within the categorization of what constituted a hip hop artist.

As referenced above, the nineties centered around women&#x27;s senses of style revolving around that of men, in that they adopted the use of oversized T-shirts and baggy pants. Also listed above are Aaliyah, TLC, and Da&#x27; Brat as conformists to that trend. Female rap group Salt-N-Pepa are considered amongst the frontrunners in leading the transition of moving away from the male alignment and asserting feminism in creating a new sense of dress. They are said to have &quot;wowed fans while wearing hot pants, cut-off denim shorts and Lycra body suits&quot;.

&quot;Black women&#x27;s relationships to their bodies occur within overlapping cultural contexts that offer contradictory messages about their value and function&quot;. In a male dominated society, it is no wonder that women used to work hard to align themselves with male images including how they&#x27;d dressed. As women generally gained access to and exposure within the offerings of several sectors of society, for example music, movies and television, we saw more images of what constituted attractiveness emerge. Following this came the perception of freedom to express oneself through several avenues including apparel. Rappers Lil&#x27; Kim and Eve are known for resorting to trends surrounding being scantily clad with provocative tattoos and being perceived as attractive in the process. Not all female rappers, or female artists in general have resorted to these methods within their careers. &quot;...the recent appearance of Black women performers, songwriters, and producers in Black popular culture has called attention to the ways in which young Black women use popular culture to negotiate social existence and attempt to express independence, self-reliance, and agency&quot;.

===LGBT community and gender variance===

Hip hop has had a history of homophobia, only recently becoming more accepting of the LGBT community. Lyrics that openly use derogatory words such as &quot;fag&quot; or &quot;dyke&quot; have saturated the market, even being found in conscious rap, considered the most progressive section of hip hop. Marc Lamont Hill argues, &quot;the progressive agendas of political rap artists such as Public Enemy, X-Clan, Paris, and Sista Souljah were strongly informed by radical Afrocentric, Black Islamic, and crude Black Nationalist ideologies that were openly hostile to queer identities&quot;.

The hip hop genre has been traditionally viewed as a predominantly hyper-masculine community, with female artists adopting traits traditionally associated with men. Female artists such as Young M.A., Conscious Daughters, and Aaliyah have often dressed in clothing typically considered masculine, wearing baggy clothes and other traditionally masculine clothing items.

However, men have also begun to explore reversing gender roles through their fashion choices. Artists like Kid Cudi, Lil Wayne, A$AP Rocky, Kanye West, Young Thug, and other self-identified straight men have made headlines for their androgynous dress. And while this style may seem new, it is not exclusive to recent times - even the early years of hip hop saw legends dressed in the disco styles of the era.

Rappers like Lil Uzi Vert and Lil B have also challenged norms by redefining fashion in hip-hop. Their bold choices, from Uzi&#x27;s avant-garde streetwear to Lil B&#x27;s eclectic and gender-fluid styles, sparked conversations about self-expression and identity. Through their attire, they broke down stereotypes and embraced individuality, inspiring a new generation to embrace diversity in fashion.

<text>The Atlantic Coast Conference Men&#x27;s Basketball Player of the Year is an award given to the men&#x27;s basketball player in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) voted as the most outstanding player. It has been presented since the league&#x27;s first season, 1953–54, by the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association, and beginning in 2012–13 has also been presented in separate voting by the league&#x27;s head coaches. The award was first given to Dickie Hemric of Wake Forest, and the coaches&#x27; award was first presented in 2013 to Shane Larkin of Miami.

Two players have won the award three times: David Thompson of NC State and Ralph Sampson of Virginia. Hemric, Len Chappell, Larry Miller, John Roche, Len Bias, Danny Ferry, Tim Duncan and JJ Redick have won the award twice. There have been two ties in the award&#x27;s history, which occurred at the end of the 2000–01 and 2012–13 seasons: In 2000–01 Joseph Forte of North Carolina and Shane Battier of Duke shared the award, while in 2012–13 Erick Green of Virginia Tech and Larkin shared honors. Green and Larkin split the honor in the first year that the ACC began voting for players of the year by the conference&#x27;s coaches and media separately (the media chose Green while the coaches chose Larkin).

<text>In mathematics, a level set of a real-valued function of real variables is a set where the function takes on a given constant value , that is:

: formula_1

When the number of independent variables is two, a level set is called a level [[curve]], also known as &quot;contour line&quot; or &quot;isoline&quot;; so a level curve is the set of all real-valued solutions of an equation in two variables and . When , a level set is called a level [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] (or &quot;isosurface&quot;); so a level surface is the set of all real-valued roots of an equation in three variables , and . For higher values of , the level set is a level [[hypersurface]], the set of all real-valued roots of an equation in variables.

A level set is a special case of a fiber.

==Alternative names==

Level sets show up in many applications, often under different names. For example, an implicit curve is a level curve, which is considered independently of its neighbor curves, emphasizing that such a curve is defined by an implicit equation. Analogously, a level surface is sometimes called an implicit surface or an isosurface.

The name isocontour is also used, which means a contour of equal height. In various application areas, isocontours have received specific names, which indicate often the nature of the values of the considered function, such as isobar, isotherm, isogon, isochrone, isoquant and indifference curve.

== Examples ==

Consider the 2-dimensional Euclidean distance: formula_2 A level set formula_3 of this function consists of those points that lie at a distance of formula_4 from the origin, that make a circle. For example, formula_5, because formula_6. Geometrically, this means that the point formula_7 lies on the circle of radius 5 centered at the origin. More generally, a sphere in a metric space formula_8 with radius formula_4 centered at formula_10 can be defined as the level set formula_11.

A second example is the plot of Himmelblau&#x27;s function shown in the figure to the right. Each curve shown is a level curve of the function, and they are spaced logarithmically: if a curve represents formula_12, the curve directly &quot;within&quot; represents formula_13, and the curve directly &quot;outside&quot; represents formula_14.
==Level sets versus the gradient==
:Theorem: If the function is differentiable, the gradient of at a point is either zero, or perpendicular to the level set of at that point.

To understand what this means, imagine that two hikers are at the same location on a mountain. One of them is bold, and decides to go in the direction where the slope is steepest. The other one is more cautious and does not want to either climb or descend, choosing a path which stays at the same height. In our analogy, the above theorem says that the two hikers will depart in directions perpendicular to each other.

A consequence of this theorem (and its proof) is that if is differentiable, a level set is a hypersurface and a manifold outside the critical points of . At a critical point, a level set may be reduced to a point (for example at a local extremum of ) or may have a 
singularity such as a self-intersection point or a cusp.

==Sublevel and superlevel sets==
A set of the form

: formula_15

is called a sublevel set of &quot;f&quot; (or, alternatively, a lower level set or trench of &quot;f&quot;). A strict sublevel set of &quot;f&quot; is

: formula_16

Similarly

: formula_17

is called a superlevel set of &quot;f&quot; (or, alternatively, an upper level set of &quot;f&quot;). And a strict superlevel set of &quot;f&quot; is

: formula_18

Sublevel sets are important in minimization theory. By Weierstrass&#x27;s theorem, the boundness of some non-empty sublevel set and the lower-semicontinuity of the function implies that a function attains its minimum. The convexity of all the sublevel sets characterizes quasiconvex functions.

<doc id="559636" wikidata="Q1439372" url="?curid=559636" title="Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester">
<text>Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester (9 March 1602 or 9 March 16033 April 1667), styled Lord Herbert of Raglan from 1628 to 1644, was an English nobleman involved in royalist politics, and an inventor.

While Earl of Glamorgan, he was sent by Charles I to negotiate a peace treaty and alliance with the leadership of the Catholic Irish Confederacy. He enjoyed some success, but the agreement quickly broke down. He then joined the Confederates, and was appointed the commander of their Munster Army.

In 1655 he wrote &quot;The Century of Inventions&quot;, detailing more than 100 inventions, including a device that would have been one of the earliest steam engines.

==Origins==
He was the son of Henry Somerset, 1st Marquess of Worcester by his wife Anne Russell, a daughter of John Russell, Baron Russell, eldest son and heir apparent of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford.

==Career==
Edward Somerset was brought up as a Roman Catholic in Monmouthshire. He graduated from Cambridge University, England, in 1627 with a Master of Arts (MA) degree. 

In his day he was one of the richest lords in England, funding his experiments, later self-funding his military endeavours, and sending large amounts of money to King Charles I during the English Civil War. He was a Cavalier who supported the King in Wales, where he raised a regiment of horse for him. His campaigning in the West of England and in Wales, however, did not go well. 

After a month with his force of over 2,000 troops encamped at Highnam, outside Gloucester, in March 1643 Herbert left them and travelled to meet the king at Oxford. In his absence the entire force surrendered without any exchange of fire, earning it the title &quot;The Mushroom Army&quot; (they appeared and disappeared very quickly). He was rewarded in 1644, however, with a peerage, being created Earl of Glamorgan and Baron Beaufort of Caldecote. Due to irregularities in the letters patent, these titles were not recognised after the Restoration.

Sent to Ireland, he made a false move in concluding a treaty, in great secrecy, on behalf of Charles that was considered to concede too much to the Catholics there; he himself was a Catholic. 

In extricating himself from that position, he became a close ally of Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, and a potential replacement for James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde as royalist leader. His plans to bring Irish troops over to England were overtaken by events, and he left for France with George Leyburn. He succeeded his father as Marquess of Worcester in 1646.

He was formally banished in 1649, but after four years in Paris returned to England in 1653. He was discovered, charged with high treason and sent to the Tower of London; he was treated leniently by the Council of State, and released on bail in 1654. That year he took up again his interest in engineering and inventions, leasing a house at Vauxhall where his Dutch or German technician Kaspar Kalthoff could work. After the Restoration his estates were restored, but he largely avoided politics, and did not press his claims to the various other titles of nobility.

==Works==
In 1655 he authored a book which consisted of textual descriptions of 100 separate inventions. It was eventually printed in 1663 and included a device described as his &quot;Water-commanding Engine&quot;. Constructed from the barrel of a cannon, it was an obvious prototype design for what would later become the steam engine, and clearly anticipated the power and applications of that machine.

In 1663 Samuel Sorbière visited Edward&#x27;s Vauxhall workshop and saw and described the &quot;hydraulic machine which the Marquis of Worcester has invented.&quot; It was designed for purposes of irrigation, and would &quot;raise to the height of forty feet, by the strength of one man and in the space of one minute of time, four large buckets of water.&quot; Cosimo de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Tuscany, visited it in 1669, when a similar description was given. Robert Hooke, however, described it as &quot;one of the perpetual motion fallacies.&quot;

Edward suggested that when he died, a model of his engine should be buried with him:
&quot;I call this a Semi Omnipotent Engine, and do intend that a model thereof be buried with me.&quot;

==Marriage and children==
He married twice:
*Firstly in 1628 to Elizabeth Dormer (died 31 May 1635), daughter of Sir William Dormer and Alice Molyneux, and sister of Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon, by whom he had one son and two daughters:
**Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort, 3rd Marquess of Worcester, his heir and successor, who was created Duke of Beaufort;
**Lady Anne Somerset (c. 1631–1662), who married Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk, and had issue;
**Lady Elizabeth Somerset (before 16351691), who married William Herbert, 1st Marquess of Powis, and had issue.
*Secondly in 1639 he married Lady Margareta O&#x27;Brien (died 26 July 1681), daughter of Henry O&#x27;Brien, 5th Earl of Thomond and Mary Brereton, by whom he had one daughter: 
**Lady Mary Somerset, died young.

==Burial==
After his death his widow remarried Donough Kearney, who was charged with treason during the Popish Plot, but acquitted.

Almost 200 years after his death, in 1861, Victorian patent inspector Bennet Woodcroft attempted to locate the grave and the model steam engine which the Marquis stated should be buried with him. Woodcroft hoped, if the model was located, that &quot;Englishmen will be gratified to find that their country has contributed even more than was supposed to the advancement of civilisation&quot;.

Woodcroft sought permission from the then Duke of Beaufort (successor to the Marquis) to examine remains in the Somerset crypt within St Cadoc&#x27;s Church, Raglan, in search of the model, and the Duke granted permission on the basis that Woodcroft also obtained ecclesiastical permission.

Archive documents indicate ecclesiastical permission was not obtained, yet Woodcroft and a party locked themselves inside the church on 4 January 1861, and opened the crypt. They found 7 coffins, as documented when the crypt had previously been opened.
They opened coffin 7, which had an inscription indicating this was the Marquis&#x27; coffin, their report stating: 
... the lead on the outside was dry and well preserved, and when a part of it had been cut and rolled back some holes were made with the bit and brace in the elm wood cover, which allowed a few smart blows with the chisel to take out a small piece of wood. 

The foot of the coffin was opened and the 6 or 7 layers of &quot;strong linen&quot; were cut open to reveal &quot;two legs inside with skin very white and not very much shrunken&quot;. Outside the linen, they found matter &quot;exactly like the slush in an Irish bog and emitting a strong but not pungent or disagreeable odour&quot;. The head of the coffin was then opened, although &quot;out of respect for the remains of the mighty dead we did not open the cloth over the face&quot;.

They then moved their attention to coffin 3, which had a plaque resting (but not fixed) on it identifying it as Lady Granville&#x27;s coffin, in the hope that the model could be found there. &quot;The lead was therefore cut and folded back and underneath there was found a carefully placed ceiling of beautifully glass-like green wax which seemed quite untouched by decay.&quot; They then cut out a section of wood and saw &quot;that the two breasts of a female lying in state confirmed the supposition that the plate [identifying this as Lady Granville&#x27;s coffin] was correctly placed on this coffin&quot;. The party then cut open the head covering and &quot;the mouth was soon disclosed and five or six long and rather misshapen teeth appeared. The lower jaw was much separated from the other and I raised it in order to search carefully below for any necklace or other ornament which might be buried there&quot;. The model was not located in this coffin. This last action, searching for a &quot;necklace or other ornament&quot;, is when the expedition shifted from a legally dubious search for a model steam engine, to a clearly illegal desecration of human remains, as having identified this coffin contained a female body and no model, there was no legitimate reason to investigate further.

They then returned to coffin 7, with their report stating:
... making a long cut through the stiff close shroud and inserting the axe point in the edge we lifted up the naked body of the renowned Marquis of Worcester. The hands were crossed over the lower part of the stomach, the right hand being uppermost and bound to the other with a lanyard of yarn rope. The skin and flesh were soft and a little shrunken and the nails were long, beautifully shaped and perfectly preserved. There was a good deal of reddish hair on the body. No sign of any substance metal wood or other hard matter being in the coffin could be observed. I was determined to make a thorough search when I was about it and therefore sending for a large screwdriver which was nearly two feet long I probed carefully round the whole body at intervals of about an inch to see if under any part or concealed by the dark mud like matter there might haply be any small metallic ring to indicate the model we were in search of.&gt; 

Having failed to find the model in either coffin, they closed the coffins &quot;as well as we could arrange them, and stopped till the great stone was placed on the vault and the loose earth above was filled in&quot;.

<text>Pat Mooney (born in 1947) has worked with civil society organizations on international trade and development issues related to agriculture, biodiversity and emerging technologies for over 40 years.

==Career==

Pat Mooney had no formal university training, but, together with Cary Fowler and Hope Shand, he began working on the &#x27;Seeds&#x27; issue - the problem that legislation was enabling agribusiness corporations to control access to the seeds to grow the decreasing variety of crops that supported global food supply - in the 1970s. In 1984, the three co-founded RAFI (Rural Advancement Foundation International), whose name was changed to ETC Group (pronounced &quot;etcetera&quot; group) in 2001. ETC Group is a small international CSO addressing the impact of new technologies on vulnerable communities.

Mooney’s more recent work has focused on geoengineering, nanotechnology, synthetic biology and global governance of these technologies as well as corporate involvement in their development. He is a member of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems, and led their Long Food Movement project.

==Awards and recognition==

* 1985 - Right Livelihood Award (with Cary Fowler) for &quot;working to save the world&#x27;s genetic plant heritage.&quot;

<doc id="559645" wikidata="Q5648723" url="?curid=559645" title="Hanna Newcombe">
<text>Hanna Newcombe (February 5, 1922 – April 10, 2011) was the co-founder of Peace Research Abstracts and Peace Research Reviews, was the recipient of the 1997 Pearson Medal of Peace and was elected a member of the Order of Canada in 2007 for her work in peace research and international relations. 

== Early life ==
Newcombe was born Hanna Hammerschlag in Prague, Czechoslovakia. She was the only surviving child of Arthur and Paula Hammerschlag (née Seger); an older brother, Georg, was killed in a tragic kitchen accident when he was a toddler. Her childhood and early adolescence were in Prague. When she was 17, the Nazis marched into Prague, prompting her Jewish parents to emigrate with her to Canada in 1939. Her father was able to obtain a visa through contacts made in the course of his business as an importer of grain. As a Canadian requirement of their immigration, the family managed a fruit farm near Grimsby, Ontario, for several years, moving to Toronto after the Second World War. Newcombe earned a B.Sc from McMaster University in 1945. She met her husband Alan George Newcombe at McMaster, and they then both went on to earn doctorates in chemistry from the University of Toronto.

== Career ==
After receiving her PhD in 1950, Newcombe never worked full-time as a chemist, due in large part to the fact that, at that time, married women with children were not expected to work. Daughter Nora was born in 1951 and son George in 1953, both in Toronto, where Alan was working at the Ontario Research Foundation. In 1955, the Newcombes moved to Hamilton, Ontario, where Alan took a job as Director of Research and Development for Porritts &amp; Spencer, a manufacturer of felts for paper making. Son Ian was born in 1956. While raising her three children, Newcombe worked occasionally as an instructor in chemistry. She also took advantage of her knowledge of several languages, including Czech, German and English, to translate scientific articles. In 1962, she briefly tried teaching high school chemistry, but was dismayed by her students&#x27; lack of interest in her subject.

After meeting Norman Alcock, a physicist who had founded the Canadian Peace Research Institute, Newcombe realized that she had found her calling: the use of science to better understand the path to peace. Alan joined her in working for CPRI shortly thereafter. The Newcombes founded the Peace Research Institute in Dundas, Ontario in the late 1970s. The Canadian Peace Research and Education Association was also their initiative. They founded and published for many years two scholarly journals: Peace Research Abstracts and Peace Research Reviews. They also organized summer institutes on peace research at Grindstone Island, located in the Rideau Lakes, which was a center for peace education managed by the Canadian Friends Service Committee. Hanna was prominent for many decades in the World Federalist Movement, the Canadian Voice of Women, and the Canadian Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). She was also an advocate of mundialization and of twinning. Her writing ranged over many topics, including ruminations on philosophy, religion and the history of science.

== Death ==
Hanna Newcombe died in Hamilton in the early morning of April 10, 2011, after a short illness, with her son Ian at her bedside. She was very proud of her three children and of her seven grandchildren: Felice, Claire, Talia, Paul, Andrew, Connor and Eric. Before she died, she knew that she had a great-grandchild on the way, and was thrilled to know that Felice&#x27;s son (Mason, born in August 2011) would continue the great chain of being. Family and friends have endowed the Newcombe Prize in Peace Studies at McMaster University, which is given annually to an outstanding undergraduate in Peace Studies. McMaster is also the home of an electronic record of her writing available at *

<doc id="559649" wikidata="Q6412305" url="?curid=559649" title="List of Syrian monarchs">
<text>The title King of Syria appeared in the second century BC in referring to the Seleucid kings who ruled the entirety of the region of Syria. It was also used to refer to Aramean kings in the Greek translations of the Old Testament, mainly indicating the kings of Aram-Damascus. Following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, the region came under the rule of France, the United Kingdom and Prince Faisal of Hejaz, who was proclaimed King of Syria on 8 March 1920. Faisal&#x27;s reign lasted a few months before he was overthrown by France and the title fell out of use.

==Background==

The term Syria was first applied by Herodotus in the 5th century BC to indicate a region generally extending between Anatolia and Egypt. With the advent of the Hellenistic period, Greeks and their Seleucid dynasty used the term &quot;Syria&quot; to designate the region between the Mediterranean and the Euphrates. The usage of the name in referring to the region during the Iron Age (ended 586 BC) is a modern practice.

==List of monarchs==
===Seleucid dynasty===
According to Polybius, King Antigonus I Monophthalmus established the Syrian kingdom which included Coele-Syria. The Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great defeated the Ptolemaic Kingdom in the Battle of Panium (200 BC); he annexed the Syrian lands controlled by Egypt (Coele-Syria) and united them with his Syrian lands, thus gaining control of the entirety of Syria. Starting from the 2nd century BC, ancient writers, such as Polybius and Posidonius, began referring to the Seleucid ruler as the king of Syria. The evidence for this title&#x27;s usage by the kings is provided by the inscription of Antigonus son of Menophilus, who described himself as the &quot;admiral of Alexander, king of Syria&quot; (Alexander refers either to Alexander I Balas or Alexander II Zabinas).

=== Non-dynastic ===
Diodotus Tryphon, who opposed Demetrius II by raising Antiochus VI to the throne, killed his protege and declared himself king ruling until 138 when the Seleucids unified Syria again.

=== Seleucid dynasty ===
=== Ptolemaic dynasty ===
=== Seleucid dynasty ===
=== Ptolemaic dynasty ===
=== Seleucid dynasty ===
=== Artaxiad dynasty ===
=== Seleucid dynasty ===
===Antonian dynasty===
===Hashemite dynasty===
On 8 March 1920, prince Faysal of the House of Hashim, supported by the Syrian National Congress, declared himself king of the Arab Kingdom of Syria; the kingdom collapsed on 24 July of the same year.

==Biblical usage for Aramean kings==
In the first translation of the Old Testament into Greek written during the third century BC (called the Septuagint), Aram and Arameans were often translated as Syria and the Syrians; hence, the king was referred to as the king of Syria, and this was carried on by many English translations. Aram in the Hebrew Old Testament and Syria in the translation indicated the kingdom of Aram-Damascus most of the times. Occasionally, other Aramean regions were also referred to as Syria. In the view of W. Edward Glenny, the rendering of Aram by Syria might be explained by an anti-Syrian bias, since at the time of the translation, Syria belonged to the Seleucids, the Jews&#x27; main enemy; Aram-Damascus was the Jews&#x27; enemy during its Iron Age prime in the 9th century BC.

<doc id="559665" wikidata="Q389512" url="?curid=559665" title="Lemminkäinen">
<text>Lemminkäinen () or Lemminki () is a prominent figure in Finnish mythology. He is one of the heroes of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, where his character is a composite of several separate heroes of oral poetry. He is usually depicted as young and good-looking, with wavy red hair.

==Description==

The original, mythological Lemminkäinen is a shamanistic figure. In the Kalevala, he has been blended together with epic war-heroes Kaukomieli/Kaukamoinen and Ahti Saarelainen. 

In one myth, he drowns in the river of Tuonela (the underworld) in trying to capture or kill the black swan that lives there as part of an attempt, as Ilmarinen once made, to win a daughter of Louhi as his wife. In a tale somewhat reminiscent of Isis&#x27; search for Osiris, Lemminkäinen&#x27;s mother searches heaven and earth to find her son. Finally, she learns of his fate and asks Ilmarinen to fashion her a rake of copper with which to dredge her son&#x27;s body from the river of Tuonela. Thus equipped, she descends into the underworld in search of her son. On the banks of the river of the underworld, she rakes up first Lemminkäinen&#x27;s tunic and shoes, and then, his maimed and broken body. Unrelenting, she continues her work until every piece of Lemminkäinen&#x27;s body is recovered. Sewing the parts together and offering prayers to the gods, the mother tries to restore Lemminkäinen to life, but while she succeeds in remaking his body, his life is still absent. Then, she entreats a bee to ascend to the halls of the over-god Ukko and fetch from there a drop of honey as ointment that would bring Lemminkäinen back to life. Only with such a potent remedy is the hero finally restored.

One of the challenges Lemminkäinen faced was a character named Surma. Surma was a terrible beast which embodied sudden, violent death and guarded the gates of the Tuonela to prevent escape. Surma is often described as being a large dog with a snake-tail that can turn people into stone (with a stare). An often-used Finnish metaphor is &quot;surman suuhun&quot; &quot;into Surma&#x27;s mouth&quot;, as if the victim was mauled to death by Surma.

==Lemminkäinen in arts==
Lemminkäinen is the subject of the four-part &quot;Lemminkäinen Suite&quot; by Jean Sibelius, and of an overture by , both of them Finnish composers.

Parts of the story of Lemminkäinen and Kullervo are used by Elizabeth Goudge (1900-1984) in her 1938 play &quot;Suomi&quot;, one of her &quot;Three Plays: Suomi; The Brontës of Haworth; Fanny Burney&quot; (Gerald Duckworth, 1939). Goudge&#x27;s modern play, set in 1899, 1917 and 1918, has modern characters, fighting for Finnish independence from Tsarist Russia. These include &quot;Suomi&quot;, the mother, nicknamed after the Finnish word for &quot;Finland&quot;, and her sons, Olof and Kyosti. Olof, a version of Lemminkäinen, marries a Russian woman, and is killed by his enemies, but seemingly resurrected in his son, Sigurd. Kyosti, a version of Kullervo, kills Sigurd, and then commits suicide. Goudge&#x27;s play includes quotes from the &quot;Kalevala&quot; and Sibelius&#x27;s &quot;Finlandia&quot;.

The 2007 album (&quot;Silent Waters&quot;) of Finnish metal band Amorphis is about the story of Lemminkäinen.

The 2008 song (&quot;River of Tuoni&quot;) by Finnish metal band Amberian Dawn is about Lemminkäinen&#x27;s mother&#x27;s search for him in the river of Tuoni. 

Lemminkäinen appears as Lemminkal Heikkinen the Warrior-Mage in Mercedes Lackey&#x27;s 500 Kingdoms Series&#x27; homage to Sámi, among other Scandinavian and northern European myths and legends, &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; (2008). 

The 2018 song The Bee by Finnish metal band Amorphis also references the story of Lemminkäinen and of the bee entrusted by his mother to retrieve honey from the halls of the over-god Ukko.

Lemminkäinen is the protagonist of the 1959 film, &quot;The Day the Earth Froze&quot;.

The &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; character Mordenkainen is partially named after him.

<doc id="559669" wikidata="Q7843987" url="?curid=559669" title="Trish Draper">
<text>Patricia Draper (born 2 April 1959) is a former Liberal Party politician. She held the seat of Makin seat from 1996 to 2007.

==Early life==
Draper was born in Woodville, South Australia, the daughter of German migrants who travelled to Australia after WWII. During her early teens she was a member of the Girl Guides and the RSPCA. Her early ambition was to become a High School Teacher, to teach economics and history. However, influenced by her mother&#x27;s chosen career of nursing, at the age of 19, Trish became a nurse.

She joined the navy and completed her training as a medic specialising in surgical and theatre nursing. After leaving the navy, she moved into the area of aged care nursing, while completing her Bachelor of Arts Degree at the University of South Australia. In 1993 and 1994 Trish was elected as a student representative for the Salisbury Campus and coordinator of the Save Salisbury Campus Campaign.

==Parliamentary career==
Draper joined the Liberal Party in 1992 and subsequently stood for pre-selection for the Makin in November 1994. Draper went on to win the seat of Makin at the 1996 Federal Election.

Draper went on to win the former Labor seat of Makin in the next three elections (1998, 2001 and 2004). In 1998 she held her seat despite holding a 1% margin before the election.

In 2000, Draper campaigned against continuing high petrol prices, calling on the Federal Government to freeze the proposed GST component of petrol excise indexation. The Prime Minister and Cabinet subsequently changed the policy to permanently abolish the GST component of petrol excise indexation.

In 2003, together with her colleague the Member for Canning Don Randall MP, Trish Draper introduced a Private Members Bill, Protection of Australian Flags (Desecration of the Flag) Bill 2003 A Bill for an Act to amend the Flags Act 1953. However the bill lapsed, and did not become law.

Draper was involved in a travel controversy when she took her boyfriend away with her to a taxpayer-funded study tour to England, Ireland, France and the Netherlands in 2004. She was forced to pay back nearly $10,000 of his expenses. Whilst Draper maintained she had done nothing wrong, the ensuing controversy lead to a review of MP travel entitlements.

In September 2007, Draper was awarded the William Wilberforce Parliamentary Award.

==Retirement from Federal Parliament==
In June 2006, after the death of a long serving staff member, and the sudden illness of her husband, Draper decided to retire from Federal politics. Although Prime Minister John Howard encouraged her to stay, Draper announced her intention to retire at the 2007 election. The seat fell to Labor then-record two-party vote of 57.7 percent from a then-record two-party swing of 8.6 percent. The seat became the safest of the 23 Labor won from the coalition at the election.

In the lead up to 2010 South Australian state election, Draper stood for pre-selection for the state seat of Newland. She failed to win the seat at the subsequent election.

As of 2022, Draper continues to be a member of the Liberal Party, and active in the Newland and Makin branches.

In 2022, Draper was a part of the South Australian Liberals committee to examine all aspects of how to get more women into parliament, after the Liberals preselected Jack Batty over 2 women in the Bragg Byelection and having only 2 women in the South Australian Parliament.

<doc id="559673" wikidata="Q184946" url="?curid=559673" title="Joe Cole">
<text>Joseph John Cole (born 8 November 1981) is an English football coach and former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder or winger. He is regarded by some commentators as one of the most talented English players of his generation and one of the most technically gifted English players of all time.

Cole started his career with West Ham United, where, after breaking into the first team in January 1999, he played more than 120 Premier League games over five seasons. He was one of a number of players who left West Ham in the summer of 2003, after the club had been relegated to the Football League First Division, with Cole signing for Chelsea. He spent seven seasons at Chelsea, playing over 280 games in all competitions and winning seven trophies, including three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and a League Cup. He left Chelsea on a free transfer in July 2010 to join Liverpool, who a year later loaned him to Lille. After a season in France, he returned to Liverpool before re-joining West Ham in January 2013. He signed for Aston Villa in June 2014, then joined Coventry City on loan in October 2015, joining on a permanent deal in January 2016. This was to be his last club in England.

Capped by England at under-16, under-18 and under-21 level, Cole was a full international between 2001 and 2010, capped by the England national team on 56 occasions, scoring 10 goals. He was selected for the England squad at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups and Euro 2004.

After retirement in 2018, Cole took up a coaching role at Chelsea. He is currently a pundit on TNT Sports.

==Early life==
Cole was born Joseph Rooks in Paddington, London, and lived there until he moved to Somers Town at the age of six.

==Club career==
===West Ham United===
Cole is a product of the West Ham United youth system. He was long touted as a child prodigy and as the hottest prospect in English football, with Manchester United reportedly offering to pay £10 million for his services as a 16-year-old. Playing in a mould similar to former England favourite Paul Gascoigne, he progressed through the West Ham ranks and signed professional terms in November 1998 before making his first-team debut aged 17 on 2 January 1999 in an FA Cup third round tie against Swansea City. Eight days later he made his Premier League debut, away to Manchester United. In 1999, Cole was part of West Ham&#x27;s victorious FA Youth Cup-winning squad (alongside Michael Carrick), defeating Coventry City 9–0 on aggregate in the final. Cole played only eight Premier League games in his first season but in the following season, he made 22 Premier League appearances, was a member of the West Ham team which won the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup, scored his first goal for West Ham, in a 3–2 League Cup win at Birmingham City on 30 November 1999 and scored his first Premier League goal, in a 5–4 home win against Bradford City, on 12 February 2000. In January 2003, then West Ham manager Glenn Roeder gave Cole the club captain&#x27;s armband at the age of 21. Cole&#x27;s last game for West Ham came on 11 May 2003 in a 2–2 draw with Birmingham City, a game which saw West Ham relegated from the Premier League. Cole won the &quot;Hammer of the Year award&quot; for 2003.

===Chelsea===

On 6 August 2003, Cole signed for Chelsea for a fee of £6.6 million after he had rejected a new contract with West Ham. He was the sixth player signed after the club&#x27;s takeover by billionaire Roman Abramovich, amongst those was his former West Ham teammate Glen Johnson. Manager Claudio Ranieri saw Cole as the perfect replacement for Gianfranco Zola, whom the club had released earlier that year, and West Ham declared that the transfer was enough for them not to sell any more players that summer.

====2003–04 season====
A week after signing for the club, Cole made his debut in a UEFA Champions League qualifier away to MŠK Žilina. He came on as a substitute for fellow new signing Damien Duff with 21 minutes remaining and caused Michal Drahno to score an own goal to conclude a 2–0 victory. On 17 August, he played his first Premier League game for the club, again replacing Duff for the last 15 minutes in a 2–1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield. He scored his first goal on 29 October in the League Cup against Notts County, replacing Jesper Grønkjær in the 70th minute and netting the last goal in a 4–2 victory which put Chelsea into the last 16. On 17 December, in the next round, he started away to Aston Villa, finishing Hernán Crespo&#x27;s cross to equalise in an eventual 1–2 defeat. Cole&#x27;s only other goal of the season was his only one in the league campaign, ending a one-two with Frank Lampard to open the scoring after five minutes away to Newcastle United, albeit in a 1–2 defeat.

====2004–05 season====
Cole took advantage of injuries to wingers Duff and Arjen Robben to become a regular member of Chelsea&#x27;s Premier League title winning team in 2004–05. He started in the League Cup Final at the Millennium Stadium on 27 February, making way for Johnson after 81 minutes of an eventual 3–2 win after extra time against Liverpool. His form saw him hit a run of goals towards the end of the season, and he scored a goal on 9 March against Norwich City blasted in from 20 yards off his weaker left foot Cole scored ten goals for Chelsea in 2004–05 and ended the season with a Premier League champions&#x27; medal.

====2005–06 season====
In the first half of the 2005–06 season, Cole secured himself in the Chelsea first-team lineup, ahead of Shaun Wright-Phillips and Damien Duff. Cole also extended his contract with Chelsea for another four seasons. He ended his season by scoring one of the goals in Chelsea&#x27;s 3–0 win over Manchester United, which earned the Premier League title for the team. He was subsequently named in the PFA Team of the Year.

====2006–07 season====
In January 2007, Cole underwent surgery for a stress fracture on his foot he suffered in late 2006. He made his return for Chelsea in the first leg of Chelsea&#x27;s 1–1 draw in the Champions League quarter-final tie against Valencia. He started for Chelsea in their victory over Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup Final, and went on to be substituted at half-time.

====2007–08 season====
In 2007–08, Cole scored a low driven shot that tucked into the corner against West Ham, opting not celebrate against his former club. He scored another goal in the League Cup semi-finals against Everton which sent Chelsea to another final. Cole played in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final, which Chelsea lost on penalties to Manchester United; he was substituted in extra time for Nicolas Anelka, who missed Chelsea&#x27;s crucial penalty.
 Joe Cole continued his excellent performances racking up a rate of ten goals and eight assists in all competitions, due to his performance he won the Chelsea Player of the Year 2008.

====2008–09 season====
On 17 August 2008, Cole scored the first Premier League goal of the management of Luiz Felipe Scolari in a 4–0 win against Portsmouth. After surgery on his knee to repair an injury he picked up in the FA Cup clash with Southend United, Cole missed the rest of the season.

====2009–10 season====
Cole did not play for Chelsea in the 2009–10 pre-season due to cruciate ligament damage in his knee, suffered in January 2009. He made a return to the starting line-up in Chelsea&#x27;s League Cup match against Queens Park Rangers on 23 September 2009 in which he was also handed the captain&#x27;s armband. Cole made his first 2009–10 Premier League appearance for Chelsea against Blackburn Rovers, playing in attacking midfield in a 5–0 win.

On 8 November 2009, he played his 250th game for Chelsea, coming on as a substitute against Manchester United in the 62nd minute for Deco, on his 28th birthday. On 3 April 2010, Cole scored the first goal in a 2–1 win at Old Trafford against Manchester United in a potential title deciding game. Described as a &quot;clever flick&quot;, his goal helped Chelsea win and overtake Manchester United at the top of the league as they were at the end of the season. He came on as a substitute as Chelsea won the 2010 FA Cup Final, his second appearance in an FA Cup Final for Chelsea. His contract with Chelsea expired on 30 June 2010, making him a free agent. Cole ended his career at Chelsea having won three Premier League titles, two FA Cups and a League Cup.

===Liverpool===

====2010–11 season====

Cole joined Liverpool on a free transfer after signing a four-year deal in July 2010. He was manager Roy Hodgson&#x27;s first signing at the club and was given the number 10 shirt. Cole was to receive £90,000-a-week wages and was advertised as a major coup by the club. Club captain Steven Gerrard even claimed Cole was as technically good as Lionel Messi. After leaving the club in 2013, Cole said that joining Liverpool was a mistake due to not feeling a connection with the club or fans.

Cole made his Liverpool debut on 5 August 2010 against Rabotnički in the UEFA Europa League assisting the opening goal for David Ngog in a 2–0 win. His league debut, against Arsenal at Anfield on 15 August 2010, lasted just 45 minutes as he was sent off for a challenge on Laurent Koscielny. In his next match, on 19 August 2010, Cole missed a penalty against Trabzonspor in the UEFA Europa League third qualifying round first leg, though Liverpool still won 1–0. Cole played in Jamie Carragher&#x27;s testimonial match, where he scored his first goal for the club. He then scored his first competitive goal for the club against Steaua București in a Europa League group stage match at Anfield on 16 September 2010, converting just 27 seconds into the game. Liverpool ended up winning 4–1. He scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool in a 2–1 win against Bolton Wanderers on 1 January 2011. On 17 February, Cole played his first match under new manager Kenny Dalglish in a 0–0 draw against Sparta Prague in the Europa League, in which he came on as a first-half substitute for the injured Fábio Aurélio. Cole scored his first and only goal under Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s tenure in a 5–0 win against Birmingham City at Anfield in April.

====Loan at Lille====

On 31 August 2011, Cole signed for French champions Lille on a season-long loan. On his debut against Saint-Étienne, he gained his first assist after a solo run where he took on and beat four players to set up the third goal in Lille&#x27;s 3–1 victory. Cole got another assist in his second Lille appearance against Bordeaux, assisting an Eden Hazard goal in a 1–1 draw. On 24 September, he scored his first goal for Lille, against Lorient, in a 1–1 draw. On 23 October, Cole came on as a 60th-minute substitute for Idrissa Gueye and scored his second goal for Lille in the 3–1 win over Lyon. Following his successful substitute appearance, he was included in the starting line-up for Lille&#x27;s Round of 16 Coupe de la Ligue match against Ligue 2 club Sedan on 26 October. In the match, Cole scored the team&#x27;s second goal in the 40th minute, which turned out to be decisive in a 3–1 win. Cole closed out the first half of the Ligue 1 season by scoring a goal in Lille&#x27;s 4–4 draw with Nice on 21 December.

Cole netted his first hat-trick for Lille in a 6–0 victory over amateur club Chantilly in the Coupe de France Round of 64 on 7 January 2012.

Cole scored his fourth league goal of the season in a 4–1 triumph over Ajaccio on 15 April, firing the ball just inside the post following a cross from Nolan Roux. The final appearance in his loan with Lille came in their 4–1 final day victory over Nancy, he provided an assist for one of Eden Hazard&#x27;s three goals and was later substituted off in the 64th minute by Nolan Roux. The playmaker underwent a career renaissance during his loan spell with Lille, scoring on four occasions in 27 league appearances and providing three assists. Following the season, Lille manager Rudi Garcia declared his desire to keep Cole at the club. On 5 June 2012, however, he confirmed that Cole would not remain at Lille after stating that new Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wanted the player to rejoin the Liverpool squad.

====Return to Liverpool====
After a one-year loan to Lille, Cole returned to Liverpool with new manager Brendan Rodgers saying he wanted to have him in the squad for the upcoming season. He played three pre-season matches, against Toronto FC, Roma, and Tottenham Hotspur. On 2 August 2012, Cole started his first Liverpool game for over a year, playing in the Europa League first leg qualifier victory over FC Gomel. He was substituted after just 23 minutes being replaced by Raheem Sterling after tweaking his hamstrings. On 18 August 2012, he was able to return as a substitute in Liverpool&#x27;s 3–0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion.

On 22 November 2012, Cole was given a start against BSC Young Boys in the Europa League, providing a cross to Jonjo Shelvey to score the opener and then scoring Liverpool&#x27;s second, in the 2–2 draw. On 9 December 2012, he scored the equaliser as Liverpool beat his former club West Ham 3–2.

===Return to West Ham===
In January 2013, West Ham signed Cole on a free transfer from Liverpool, with Cole returning to his first professional club on an 18-month deal. He made his second &quot;debut&quot; on 5 January in an FA Cup third round tie against Manchester United. The game finished 2–2 with Cole providing the assists for both of West Ham&#x27;s goals which were scored by James Collins. Cole scored his first league goal on his return to West Ham in a 1–1 home draw with Queens Park Rangers on 19 January 2013, scoring from close range after Carlton Cole&#x27;s shot had been saved by QPR goalkeeper Júlio César.
Cole scored his second West Ham goal since his return on 25 February 2013 in a 2–3 defeat to Tottenham, putting the Hammers 2–1 up by turning with the ball to score. On 17 August 2013, Cole scored West Ham&#x27;s first Premier League goal of the 2013–14 campaign, netting the first in a 2–0 home victory over newly promoted Cardiff City.

Cole was ruled out of action for six weeks with a hamstring injury in September 2013. On 30 November 2013, he scored his second goal of the season in a home victory over Fulham, coming off the bench to complete the 3–0 victory. At the end of the 2013–14 season, and the end of Cole&#x27;s 18-month contract, his departure from West Ham was confirmed. In his second spell, he had played in 37 games in all competitions, scoring five goals.

===Aston Villa===
In June 2014, Cole signed a two-year contract with Aston Villa on a free transfer after he was released by West Ham. His debut for the club came on 27 August, starting and being replaced by Andreas Weimann in the 62nd minute as they lost 0–1 to League One club Leyton Orient in the second round of the League Cup.

Cole&#x27;s first Premier League game was on 18 October, coming on for the final nine minutes in place of Christian Benteke in a 0–3 defeat away to Everton. On 29 November, Cole made his first start for Villa away to Burnley, opening the scoring in a 1–1 draw. He was an unused substitute on 30 May 2015 in the FA Cup Final, which Villa lost 0–4 to Arsenal.

===Coventry City===
On 16 October 2015, Cole signed for Coventry City on a 35-day, emergency loan deal, and made his debut four days later, playing for just under an hour in an away 0–0 draw against Rochdale. His debut goal came on 3 November in a 4–3 home win against Barnsley, a free-kick which put Coventry 4-2 up. In November, his loan with Coventry was extended until 3 January 2016.

On 7 January 2016, Cole signed on a free transfer on a deal lasting until the end of the season. In all, Cole made 22 league appearances for the Sky Blues, scoring twice, both from long-range free kicks.

===Tampa Bay Rowdies and retirement===
On 4 May 2016, Cole signed with the Tampa Bay Rowdies in the North American Soccer League (NASL), signing a contract through the end of the 2017 NASL season, with a club option for 2018. He made his debut ten days later, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–1 home draw against Rayo OKC. Two weeks later, away to Minnesota United, he scored his first goal to open a 2–0 win, assisting Eric Avila for the other; he was voted the league&#x27;s Player of the Week. On 19 October, Cole was one of ten players nominated for the NASL Golden Ball award. In June 2018, Cole was promoted to assistant coach with the Rowdies, while still acting as a player as well.

Cole retired from professional football on 13 November 2018. He has since taken up a coaching role at Chelsea.

==International career==
As a youngster, Cole played for the England&#x27;s under-17 team, where he scored the winning goal against Norway in a final of the Nordic Tournament. Cole made his senior international debut against Mexico in May 2001. He was a member of England&#x27;s 2002 World Cup squad, making one substitute appearance in the tournament. Cole was also a squad member at UEFA Euro 2004, but did not play.

Cole&#x27;s displays in England&#x27;s friendlies leading up to the 2006 World Cup enhanced his reputation ahead of the summer&#x27;s finals in Germany. In May 2006, he was confirmed in the England squad for the World Cup, ahead of Chelsea teammate Shaun Wright-Phillips. He played on the left side of midfield in England&#x27;s opening game against Paraguay on 10 June 2006. On 20 June 2006, England drew with Sweden in Group B play, with a final score of 2–2. Cole scored a volley in the 34th minute of the match and got an assist in the 85th when he sent in a ball to Steven Gerrard, with this contribution earning him the Man of the match award.

Cole lined up for the England squad for the first time since the 2006 World Cup in the 1–1 friendly draw against the Netherlands, on 15 November 2006 providing an assist for Wayne Rooney from a cross. After another injury, he returned to start the friendly against Brazil at Wembley Stadium on 1 June 2007.

Cole scored his seventh goal for England in June 2007, in Euro 2008 qualifying, away to Estonia.

On 7 February 2008, Cole was one of the 23-man squad selected for the friendly against Switzerland which they won 2–1, courtesy of Jermaine Jenas and Shaun Wright-Phillips goals. For Jenas&#x27; goal, Cole skipped down the left and crossed to Jenas. Cole was named Man of the match for his performance.

In August 2008, Cole scored a late equalising goal in a 2–2 draw at Wembley against the Czech Republic after coming on as a substitute. He then scored England&#x27;s two goals in the next fixture after coming on as a second-half substitute in the 2–0 defeat of Andorra in the opening match for 2010 World Cup qualifying. In England&#x27;s next World Cup qualifier, against Croatia, he suffered a head injury in a clash with Croatian defender Robert Kovač which resulted in the Croat&#x27;s sending off.

Cole was named in the final 23-man selection for England&#x27;s 2010 World Cup squad. He played, and scored, in a 3–0 victory against Platinum Stars, of South Africa&#x27;s Premier Soccer League, in an unofficial warm-up game. However, he was limited to only two substitute appearances in the tournament itself, as England lost to Germany in the second round in what was to be his final international appearance.

==Style of play==

A clever, versatile, and technically gifted midfielder, Cole was capable of playing in several offensive midfield positions, as an attacking midfielder, winger or supporting striker. A quick, strong and creative player, Cole was known in particular for his dribbling skills, and was capable of both scoring and creating goals due to his vision, passing and striking ability. His dribbling and overall flair was praised by Pelé, who stated that, &quot;He has the skills of a Brazilian,&quot; during Cole&#x27;s spell at Chelsea. Despite his talent, some pundits have argued that he failed to live up to the potential he demonstrated in his youth, partially due to the recurring injuries he sustained throughout his career.

==Personal life==
Cole married fitness instructor Carly Zucker in June 2009. Cole had been dating Zucker since 2002 and proposed to her in 2007. The couple have a daughter, Ruby Tatiana Cole, born in March 2010, and a son, Harrison &quot;Harry&quot; Cole, born in October 2012.

In November 2009, Cole was caught driving his Audi A4 at 105 mph on a 70 mph section of dual carriageway in Claygate, Surrey. Subsequently Cole received a suspended driving ban, and was fined £750 and ordered to pay £600 costs.

Cole is a wearer of contact lenses. He has worn them since his early days at Chelsea.

<text>Escott Graves Meredith Reid, CC (January 21, 1905 – September 28, 1999), was a Canadian diplomat who helped shape the United Nations and NATO, author, international public servant and academic administrator.

==Early life and education==

Born in Campbellford, Ontario, he was the son of Shropshire native and Anglican minister Rev. Alfred John Reid (1861–1957), by his wife Morna Irvine Meredith (1871–1962), the youngest daughter of Edmund Allen Meredith and a god-daughter of George Irvine. His Meredith grandfather had served as Deputy Under-Secretary of Canada, and Reid later occupied his very same offices at Parliament Hill.

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Trinity College, in the University of Toronto in 1927. A Rhodes scholar, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1929 and a Master of Arts degree in 1935 from Christ Church, Oxford. Though academic jobs were scarce in 1930, he had won a Rockefeller Fellowship which enabled him to study the Canadian party and electoral systems in general and Saskatchewan&#x27;s in particular.

At Oxford he had met and married Ruth Herriot, of Winnipeg, and they had three children: Patrick Reid; Morna Reid; and Tim Reid (b. 1936), a Canadian educator, civil servant, and executive.

==Public life and career==

Turning down a position to teach at Harvard University, from 1932 to 1938, he was the first full-time National Secretary for the Canadian Institute of International Affairs (CIIA), today known as the Canadian International Council (CIC). He was active in the League for Social Reconstruction, an association of left-wing intellectuals founded in Montreal and Toronto in the winter of 1931–1932. He also joined the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation, the new social-democratic political party that took shape in 1932–1933. His left-wing views and his conviction that Canada should maintain neutrality in a renewed European war put him at odds with many CIIA members, and essentially made it necessary for him to find a new career path. From 1937 to 1938, he was the acting Professor of Government and Political Science at Dalhousie University.

In 1939, he joined the Canadian Foreign Service and held positions in Washington, London, San Francisco and Ottawa, working on the creation of the United Nations. He was an important member of that extraordinary generation of public servants who helped give Canadian statecraft in the 1940s and 1950s its reputation for excellence.

He accompanied Minister of Trade and Commerce James MacKinnon on a tour of Latin America in 1941 which established trade agreements with several nations. From 1946 to 1949 he was Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s chief aide, and instrumental in devising the idea of a collective security alliance of Western democracies, which culminated in NATO.

In 1947, he was appointed Assistant Under-Secretary for External Affairs and was Deputy Under-Secretary from 1948 to 1952. He was a member of the Canadian delegation to the founding conference of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945. From 1952 to 1957, he was the High Commissioner for Canada to India and from 1958 to 1962 he was Ambassador to West Germany. From 1962 to 1965, he was Director of the South-Asia and Middle East Department of the World Bank. From 1965 to 1969, he was the first Principal of Glendon College, York University.

==Retirement and legacy==

Reid spent a large part of his retirement at the farm he and his wife owned at Wakefield, Quebec. From 1973 to 1989 he published seven books, all rooted in his personal experience while dealing with subjects of evident public interest. They included works about the World Bank, the founding of the United Nations, the making of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Hungarian and Suez crises of 1956, his years in India and his friendship with Jawaharlal Nehru, and, finally, his autobiography, &#x27;Radical Mandarin&#x27;, which is how he referred to himself.

Though he was thought by some to have been &#x27;arrogant, given to excess, and a naïve liberal idealist&#x27;, Reid&#x27;s vital contributions helped to shape some of the 20th century&#x27;s most important international developments. During his service, Canadian diplomacy was at the forefront of the recognised world leaders, a status that declined rapidly after his departure. In 1971, Reid was made a Companion of the Order of Canada &quot;for his services as a diplomat, international public servant and educator&quot;. In 1993, he received the Pearson Medal of Peace for his work as a public servant. He died in Ottawa on, September 28, 1999.

<doc id="559679" wikidata="Q2548615" url="?curid=559679" title="Farragut North station">
<text>Farragut North station is an underground Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., located on the Red Line. The station serves Downtown Washington and is immediately northwest of Farragut Square. With an average of 7,615 daily riders in 2023, Farragut North was the sixth-busiest stop in the system.

==History==
Farragut North was one of the original five stations to open with the first section of the Red Line on March 27, 1976. It was the western terminus of the Red Line until January 17, 1977, when Dupont Circle opened. In 1992, the station coffer was painted white.

On February 12, 2010 at approximately 10:13 a.m. a train derailed in the pocket track immediately to the north of the station when the front car left the tracks. Of the approximately 345 passengers on board, one person was transported to the hospital. All of the passengers were evacuated without incident. The cause of the derailment was investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board. It was found that the train derailed as it was leaving the pocket track due to a derailer, preventing the train from entering the active main tracks and potentially a deadly collision.

On November 24, 2009, a large crack was found in the ceiling during a routine inspection; repairs began the following day. On Wednesday, November 17, 2010, a chunk of concrete fell from the station roof after street construction work on Connecticut Avenue above the station penetrated the station roof. The station reopened the next day after inspection and emergency repairs. During the majority of 2011, the station had structural repairs. The renovation added a new structural support column, patched cracks in the ceiling where moisture is entering the station, and acoustic ceiling tiles replaced. In addition, the escalators were overhauled.

On January 15, 2018, a 7000-series train derailed on the northbound track between Farragut West and Metro Center because of a cracked track. The response was hampered by poor radio reception for Metro&#x27;s radios inside the tunnel and minimal cell service due to the depth and the lack of repeaters.

In 2019, Metro repaired the station chiller, which had been out of service for almost 4 years.

Between January 15 to January 21, 2021, the station was closed because of security concerns due to the Inauguration of Joe Biden.

===Farragut West tunnel===
Farragut North is only a block away (across the square) from Farragut West station; however, there is no direct connection between the two stations. WMATA originally planned to have a single Farragut station that would serve as an alternate transfer station to ease congestion that would develop in Metro Center. However, it would have been constructed using the cut-and-cover method, disrupting the square above. The National Park Service, which owns the square, would not allow construction which would disrupt the park, so the stations were built separately with no direct passenger connection.

As part of its long-term capital improvement plan dated September 12, 2002, Metro has proposed building an underground pedestrian tunnel connecting the station with Farragut West to relieve transfer pressure on Metro Center. This work would also include projects to expand capacity at the station, including more fare gates, extending the mezzanines down the length of the station, more platform-mezzanine connections and more.

On October 28, 2011, Metro announced its Farragut Crossing program, allowing riders using a SmarTrip card up to 30 minutes to transfer for free by foot between Farragut West and Farragut North stations.

==Station layout==
Farragut North station features unique architecture not seen in other stations throughout the system. Its mezzanine stretches across more of the platform and is longer than most, with an open depression looking onto the platform in the middle. There are two elevated mezzanines that serve different escalators and exits. Special buttress-like structures support these stretches of the mezzanine. The low, flat ceiling at the west end was built to accommodate a proposed freeway ramp to Interstate 66, which was never built.

South of this station, a non-revenue track diverges from the outbound track that connects with the outbound track on the shared Orange/Blue/Silver Line tracks between Farragut West and McPherson Square station.

&quot;Pulse&quot; is a 2013 sculpture by Jefre Manuel, installed at the station&#x27;s Connecticut Avenue and K Street, NW entrance. It is mounted to the wall at the Connecticut Avenue and K Street, NW entrance. The installation is made of acrylic resin tile. It was funded by the Golden Triangle BID and DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities.

<doc id="559686" wikidata="Q5386756" url="?curid=559686" title="Eric Hoskins">
<text>Eric William Hoskins (born November 29, 1960) is a Canadian physician and former politician who served as an Ontario cabinet minister from 2010 to 2018. A member of the Ontario Liberal Party, he represented Toronto—St. Paul&#x27;s in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2009 to 2018. Before entering politics, Hoskins was the president of War Child Canada and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2008 for his humanitarian work.

Hoskins served in the governments of Dalton McGuinty and Kathleen Wynne, holding the portfolios of Health and Long-Term Care (2014–2018), Economic Development, Trade, and Employment (2013–2014), Children and Youth Services (2011–2012), and Citizenship and Immigration (2010–2011). In 2013, he contended for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party, which was won by Kathleen Wynne. Hoskins resigned from cabinet and the legislature on February 26, 2018, three months before the provincial election. On June 20, 2018, the federal government announced that Hoskins had been appointed Chair of the Advisory Council on the Implementation of National Pharmacare.

== Early life and education ==
Hoskins was born on November 29, 1960, in Simcoe, Ontario. After he attended Simcoe Composite School for high school, Hoskins completed a bachelor of science (B.Sc.) in chemistry at McMaster University in 1982 and graduated with a doctor of medicine (M.D.) from McMaster University Medical School in 1985. After an internship in internal medicine, Hoskins was awarded a Rhodes scholarship and subsequently continued his studies at the University of Oxford where he completed a doctor of philosophy (DPhil) in public health and epidemiology. Hoskins also holds a master of science (M.Sc.) from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and a postgraduate diploma in health economics from The University of Aberdeen. He is a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada and is board-certified in the specialty of community medicine (public health).

==Career==
=== Working in conflict areas ===
From 1987 to 1990, Hoskins lived and worked in Sudan providing humanitarian relief to Ethiopian refugees in eastern Sudan, and to displaced civilians in southern Sudan. In 1991, Hoskins co-founded the International Study Team, and led a group of international experts to examine the impact of war on the civilian population in Iraq. The study provided a detailed humanitarian assessment of post-Gulf War Iraq.

Having seen the impact of war on Iraqi children, Hoskins lobbied the Canadian government to release over 2 million dollars of frozen Iraqi assets held in Canadian banks, and spent the following two years overseeing the purchase and distribution of food and medicine to tens of thousands of at-risk Iraqi children.

=== Department of Foreign Affairs ===
In 1997, Hoskins joined the Department of Foreign Affairs Canada as Lloyd Axworthy&#x27;s Senior Policy Advisor. While at the Department of Foreign Affairs, he was responsible for contributing to Canadian foreign policy in the areas of human rights, human security, humanitarian affairs, peace building, war-affected children and Africa.

Hoskins later also served as an advisor to the Office of the Special Representative for Children and Armed Conflict at the United Nations, and has been involved in setting United Nations policy on issues concerning the protection of children living with war.

=== War Child Canada ===
Hoskins is the co-founder and former president of War Child Canada, a charitable organization that works to raise funds for relief and development programs in support of war-affected children around the world. Working alongside his wife, War Child Executive Director Samantha Nutt, Hoskins helped the organization develop international relief programs and spread awareness of the issues facing war-affected children. He worked with the United Nations and non-governmental organizations in some of the world&#x27;s worst conflict areas including Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Burundi, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

As President of War Child Canada, Hoskins was a frequent contributor to Maclean&#x27;s magazine on war-related issues. He was a regular commentator on CTV, CBC and other major broadcast networks concerning the impact of war on civilians. In 2008, Hoskins was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for his humanitarian work.

=== First foray into politics ===
On April 21, 2007, Hoskins was chosen as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Haldimand—Norfolk for the 2008 Federal election. On October 14, 2008, he was defeated by Conservative incumbent Diane Finley.

=== Provincial politics ===
On August 12, 2009, Hoskins was nominated as the provincial Liberal candidate in the St. Paul&#x27;s by-election. On September 19, 2009, he defeated Toronto Sun columnist Sue-Ann Levy running for the Progressive Conservatives.

On January 18, 2010, he was named Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in Dalton McGuinty&#x27;s second government.

In the 2011 Ontario election, Hoskins was easily re-elected defeating PC candidate Christine McGirr by 16,076 votes. After the election he was appointed as Minister of Children and Youth Services.

Hoskins resigned on November 9, 2012, to stand as a candidate in the Ontario Liberal Party leadership election. He was eliminated after the first ballot and he endorsed Kathleen Wynne, the eventual winner. On February 11, 2013, he was appointed Minister of Economic Development, Trade &amp; Employment.

Hoskins was re-elected in June 2014, and was appointed by Kathleen Wynne as Minister of Health and Long-Term Care.

On February 26, 2018, Hoskins announced his resignation as an MPP and as Minister of Health and Long-Term Care.

=== Pharmacare leader ===

On June 20, 2018, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Hoskins to head a national pharmacare strategy.

== Awards and recognition ==
In April 2008, Hoskins was made an Officer of the Order of Canada by Governor General Michaëlle Jean for his humanitarian work. At age 33, Hoskins became the youngest recipient of the United Nations Association in Canada&#x27;s Lester B. Pearson Peace Medal and was later awarded the Meritorious Service Cross by the Governor General of Canada in the name of the Queen of Canada for his work in war-torn communities around the world.

Hoskins has been awarded the Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration Citation for Citizenship, was a member of Canada&#x27;s Top 40 Under 40 Award, and won the Distinguished Alumni Award from McMaster University.

Hoskins and his wife, Samantha Nutt, received Honorary Doctorates of Law from McMaster University in May 2005 for their work promoting human rights and their role in delivering humanitarian assistance to some of the world&#x27;s most vulnerable populations. Hoskins also has honorary degrees from Brock and Niagara Universities.

<doc id="559687" wikidata="Q318964" url="?curid=559687" title="Stabshauptmann">
<text> () is a German language variant of senior captain.

== History==
Historically, a rank named &quot;Stabshauptmann&quot; (also: &quot;Stabskapitän&quot;) existed in several German armies in the 18th century. However, while the modern Stabshauptman is a Senior Captain senior to a regular Hauptmann, the historical Stabshauptmann was a Junior captain, ranking below Hauptmann rank. In 18th century armies companies often were &quot;owned&quot; by a noble man, who formally was the company&#x27;s captain, but did not actually command the unit. Instead, the owner of the company appointed an officer from the company his &quot;Stabshauptmann&quot;, who technically served as the Hauptmann&#x27;s mere staff assistant, but actually led the unit in his place.

The reversing in ranking of &quot;Hauptmann&quot; and &quot;Stabshauptmann&quot; in modern times is consequence of the practice in modern German military organisations (Reichswehr, Wehrmacht) to name the highest rank of a rank group beginning with the prefix &quot;Stabs-&quot;, indicating that the holder serves in staff position to officers of the next higher rank group, e.g. during World War II, the highest NCO rank in the German army was Stabsfeldwebel, who served as direct assistant to company-grade officers or in staff function. However, this is no longer represented in the Bundeswehr&#x27;s post-World War II rank structure since the creation of rank levels senior to the &quot;Stabs-&quot; level of ranks, denoted by the prefix &quot;Oberstabs-&quot; (&quot;Senior Staff-&quot;, e.g. Oberstabsfeldwebel). There are no plans to create the rank of &quot;Oberstabshauptmann&quot;.

== Belgium ==

The rank of () is used by the Belgian Land, Air and Medical Components. It is rank just below Major, but still ranked OF-3 with the NATO rank structure.

== Germany ==

 is the highest military rank in the Bundeswehr for specialist officers ().

Instead of being promoted to the rank of major, specialist officers that were holding the rank of Hauptmann (Captain) for a specific time are promoted to the rank of Stabshauptmann and given the salary of a Major. Sometimes regular officers are promoted to a post that is intended for a Stabshauptmann if there is no free post for a Major. 

The badge of rank is four silver stars. It is one of the rarest ranks in the German military. One notable case in which the rank is conferred has been the &quot;MilFD officers&quot;. These are former NCOs who have completed a training programme in order to be raised from the ranks, to specialist-officer roles. The duties of such officers are therefore specialised similar to those of Warrant officer grades in the United States Army .

=== Rank insignia ===
On the shoulder straps (Heer, Luftwaffe) there are four silver pips (stars).

There is no corresponding rank for officers in Bundeswehr Joint Medical Service.

<text>Dupont Circle station is an underground rapid transit station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro in Washington, D.C. Located below the traffic circle, it is one of the busiest stations in the Metro system, with an average of 16,948 entries each weekday. The station parallels Connecticut Avenue NW between the southern edge of the circle to the south and Q Street NW to the north.

== Station layout ==
Dupont Circle station has two tracks with side platforms, one of the only Red Line stations with this setup. This single-bore layout is required by its deep passage beneath the Connecticut Avenue NW underpass and an abandoned streetcar tunnel, now used as an art space. The station&#x27;s depth required construction using rock-tunneling methods.

There are two entrances to the station. The north entrance, on the southeast corner of Q Street NW and 20th Street NW contains a set of three escalators and an elevator to reach a mezzanine and fare control at the north end of the station. Unique to the station, the edges of the escalators are trellised with plants where normally there would be granite slabs. The south entrance, located on the southern edge of Dupont Circle at 19th Street NW and Connecticut Avenue NW, has another set of three escalators to reach a separate mezzanine and fare control at the south end of the platforms. The station&#x27;s north entrance escalators are long. Its south entrance escalators are long and rise .

==History==
Dupont Circle station opened on January 17, 1977, the first to open after the original stretch of the Red Line between Union Station and Farragut North. It remained the western terminus of the Red Line until December 5, 1981, upon the extension of the line to Van Ness–UDC.

On May 6, 2000, a woman fell between the tracks but was unharmed as the train passed over her. The station was temporarily closed and the woman was extracted from under the train as power had been shut off. In May 2006, a Metro employee died after being struck by a train in the station.

In 2007, a portion of Walt Whitman&#x27;s 1865 poem &quot;The Wound Dresser&quot; was inscribed into the granite wall around the north entrance escalators to honor the city&#x27;s caregivers during the HIV crisis.

The south entrance was closed from February 1 to October 21, 2012, to replace all three escalators, deemed among the system&#x27;s least reliable.

On January 15, 2018, a train headed to Glenmont derailed outside the station. Nobody was seriously hurt.

In 2019, Metro repaired the station chiller, which had been out of service for almost 4 years.

In April 2019, construction began on a station canopy for the north entrance, identical to other canopies across the system. Construction was set to be completed in summer 2022. However, construction was delayed due to the contractor that was supposed to provide the custom glass panels going bankrupt.

During the afternoon of December 10, 2019, smoke was reported from an arcing insulator at station causing service to be suspended between Dupont Circle and . Red Line trains were later forced to single track between Friendship Heights and Van Ness due to another arcing insulator failure.

<text>, short: StKptLt / in lists: SKL, () is the highest &quot;Fachdienstoffizier&quot; rank (en: specialist officer, comparable to US limited duty officer) in the German Navy.

The rank is rated OF-2a in NATO, and equivalent to &quot;Stabshauptmann&quot; in Heer, and Luftwaffe. It is grade A13 in the pay rules of the Federal Ministry of Defence and is senior to the regular OF-2 rank of (en: Lt).

==Address==
The official manner, in line to ZDv 10/8, of formal addressing of military people with the rank (OF-2a) is &quot;Herr/Frau &quot;. However, as to German traditions and in line to seamen&#x27;s language the &quot;&quot; will be addressed &quot;Herr/Frau Kaleu&quot;.

==Rank insignia==
Its rank insignia, worn on the sleeves and shoulders, are one five-pointed star above two stripes with two half stripes between them (without the star when rank loops are worn).

==Particularity==
Military people of the &quot;line officer career&quot; () skip over this rank, by regular promotion from (OF-2) to Korvettenkapitän (OF-3); however, the pay grade A13 ( and Korvettenkapitän) is identical.

The sequence of ranks (top-down approach) in that particular group is as follows:
*OF-2a: / Stabshauptmann
*OF-2: / 
*OF-1a: / 
*OF-1: /

<text>Muriel Helen Duckworth (née Ball; October 31, 1908 – August 22, 2009) was a Canadian pacifist, feminist, and social and community activist. She was a practising Quaker, a religious denomination committed to non-violence. Duckworth maintained that war, with its systematic violence against women and children, is a major obstacle to social justice. She argued that money spent on armaments perpetuates poverty while reinforcing the power of privileged elites. She believed that &quot;war is stupid&quot; and she steadfastly refused to accept popular distinctions between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; wars.

Duckworth was a founding member of the Nova Scotia Voice of Women for Peace, a provincial branch of the national peace organization called the Voice of Women (VOW). From 1967 to 1971, she served as president of VOW leading protests against the Canadian government&#x27;s quiet support for the US-led war in Vietnam.

Duckworth was the first woman in Halifax to run for a seat in the Nova Scotia legislature. She also led community organizing efforts seeking improvements in education, housing, social assistance and municipal planning. In her later years, Duckworth performed with the Halifax chapter of the Raging Grannies, a group that composes and sings satirical ballads promoting social justice.

Duckworth received many honours and awards including the 1981 Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case and the Order of Canada in 1983. In 1991, she received the Pearson Medal of Peace. She was also granted 10 honorary university degrees.

==Childhood influences==

===Early life and education===

Muriel Helena Ball was born on October 31, 1908, on her parents&#x27; farm in Austin, Quebec, a village in the Eastern Townships about 130 km east of Montreal. She was one of five children born to Anna Westover and Ezra Ball. Their farm was on the scenic shores of Lake Memphremagog and Muriel spent her first years enjoying the natural beauty around her. She was so deeply affected by the landscape that she returned nearly every summer for the rest of her life to the cottage her aunt and uncle built in 1913.

Although the family farm was suitable for raising livestock such as chickens and cattle, the land was not very fertile. Muriel&#x27;s mother supplemented the family income by taking in summer boarders, while her father sold lightning rods. Muriel attended a local one-room country school until she was seven, then transferred to a larger school in the town of Magog where she boarded during the week with two siblings and an aunt. In 1917, when she was nine, her father sold the farm and bought a grocery and feed store in Magog. He also sold wood and oil. The next year, her mother opened a tea room and boarding home that catered to summer visitors who came by steamship and rail. As they grew older, Muriel and her two sisters helped their mother with cleaning, cooking, making beds and waiting on tables. Serving the public in the tea room helped Muriel cope with her chronic shyness.

===Anna Ball as role model===

Her mother&#x27;s career as a successful businesswoman and her dedication to community service in the Methodist church and the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union had a powerful influence on Muriel. Anna Ball had a boarding house, a block from the train station. She fed hungry men and gave shelter to homeless young women who came to Magog on the trains and raised funds to establish a home for the elderly and started a community lending library. Duckworth was also an admirer of Nellie McClung and Agnes Macphail, two political activists who championed women&#x27;s rights. Many decades later, Muriel told an interviewer that her mother&#x27;s example helped lead her into social activism. Her mother cared passionately about what she did, Muriel said. She believed she could have a positive effect and did.

===Ontario Ladies College===

After finishing high school which ended at grade 11, Muriel attended the Ontario Ladies College, a Methodist girls&#x27; school in Whitby, Ontario. Her aunt, Abbie Ball, taught there and offered to pay Muriel&#x27;s fees. The college provided instruction in languages, history, mathematics and piano but little science. The 15-year-old Muriel was too shy to participate in drama even though her aunt was the school&#x27;s drama coach. She also suffered from homesickness. Once a month, guest speakers, usually from the United Church of Canada addressed the student assembly. Muriel especially remembered James Endicott, then a missionary in China, who went on to become a prominent church leader and a lifelong acquaintance.

==University years==

===McGill, 1925–1929===

Muriel undertook studies at Montreal&#x27;s McGill University with the help of a small college bursary and money from her Aunt Abbie. She was enrolled in the university&#x27;s Bachelor of Arts program and in her graduating year, took the education courses required to qualify for a high school teaching diploma. To practise teaching in front of a classroom full of children as well as her fellow education students was especially difficult for her, but Muriel hid her fear so well that the supervising professor praised her apparent lack of nervousness. She also tried to overcome her shyness by entering a public speaking contest and volunteering to take minutes at student meetings.

===Student Christian Movement===

Muriel&#x27;s participation in the Student Christian Movement (SCM) at McGill was a life-changing experience. &quot;Looking back over the years,&quot; she told her biographer, &quot;I&#x27;ve felt always that the experience of the SCM was the most important thing that happened to me, probably the most important aspect of my college life, more important than any of the courses that I took.&quot; The SCM conducted small study groups in which students were encouraged to discuss their beliefs freely and come to their own conclusions about how to interpret the Gospels. For Muriel, such discussions were unsettling and painful, yet also exciting. &quot;I had always before treated the Gospel as though its authors had set down day by day events in the life of Jesus as they happened,&quot; she said. &quot;To face the implication that nothing was written down until after Jesus died was itself a shock. But this question of free and open discussion, that everything needed to be challenged, to be questioned, to be talked about, that was completely opposite to the authoritarian approach in the church.&quot; The SCM study groups fostered independent thinking. &quot;This was the beginning of my adult search for truth,&quot; Muriel told her biographer, &quot;and my sense that all things must be open to me.&quot;

===Graduation and marriage===

In 1926, Muriel met Jack Duckworth, a McGill student who was also active in the SCM. She was 18, he was 29. Duckworth was attending university to qualify for a job with the YMCA where he had been a volunteer working with boys in Vancouver. To finance his studies, he became a student minister and discovered his talents as a preacher. He decided to continue studying theology after earning his MA degree from McGill. In 1928, Muriel and Duckworth were engaged to be married. In the fall, he began two years of studies at the Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York (UTS). Muriel graduated from McGill in May 1929 and a month later the Duckworths were married at an informal wedding in Montreal. They began their married life in New York where Duckworth was completing his final year at UTS.

===Union Theological Seminary===
Muriel Duckworth enrolled as a full-time student at Union Theological Seminary in 1929. She was also registered as a part-time UTS field student and worked with poor teenage girls at a community church in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen on New York&#x27;s West Side. Duckworth met these 16- and 17-year-old working-class girls twice a week in a recreation group and in a Sunday School class. She also visited their homes gaining first-hand knowledge of the conditions experienced by working-class immigrants who lived in cramped, windowless flats beside &quot;booming and clattering&quot; elevated trains. In her academic studies, Duckworth learned about the Social Gospel movement which strove to improve people&#x27;s lives through social services and adult education at a time when the Great Depression was just beginning. Her teachers at UTS included Harry Ward, a Christian socialist who campaigned for civil and political rights and the noted theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. &quot;The Social Gospel and pacifism were linked in my mind,&quot; Duckworth said adding that she remembered hearing about Eugene V. Debs &quot;a labour hero who had gone to prison for opposition to the First World War and who ran for president of the U.S. while he was in jail.&quot;

===Family life===

Muriel and Jack Duckworth returned to Montreal in 1930 where they began raising a family. Their son Martin was born in 1933; Eleanor, named after Eleanor Roosevelt, was born in 1935 followed by John in 1938. The family moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1947 where Jack Duckworth served as general secretary of the YMCA, while Muriel worked in adult education. From 1948 until 1962, Muriel was a part-time parent education adviser for the Nova Scotia Department of Education. Jack Duckworth died, age 76, in May 1975 when Muriel was 66.

==Subsequent activities==

Muriel Duckworth&#x27;s pacifism was reflected in her religious beliefs and her work on behalf of peace organizations. She was a founding member of the Nova Scotia Voice of Women, a provincial branch of the Voice of Women (VOW). She served as the National President of VOW, now called the Canadian Voice of Women for Peace, from 1967 to 1971. During her presidency, VOW protested vigorously against the US-led War in Vietnam. It also condemned the Canadian government&#x27;s tacit support for the war and its policy of quietly encouraging the sale of Canadian-made weapons to the US military. In 1969 and 1971, Duckworth helped organize two highly publicized visits to Canada by Vietnamese women directly affected by the war.

Duckworth was also active in community organizing, electoral politics and the advancement of women&#x27;s issues. In 1971, she helped establish the Movement for Citizens&#x27; Voice and Action (MOVE), a coalition of community groups in Halifax, Nova Scotia working for a wide range of goals including improvements in education, housing, social assistance and municipal planning. Duckworth became the first woman in Halifax to run for a seat in the Nova Scotia Legislature when she campaigned as a New Democratic Party candidate during the provincial elections of 1974 and 1978. In 1976, she became a founding member of the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women (CRIAW), an organization set up to sponsor the dissemination of research on issues affecting women. She served as president of CRIAW in 1979–80. Later, she played a leading role in organizing a five-day Women&#x27;s International Peace Conference held in Halifax in June 1985.

Duckworth was the recipient of numerous honours including the 1981 Governor General&#x27;s Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case and the Order of Canada in 1983. In 1991, she received the Pearson Medal of Peace. She was also granted 10 honorary degrees including one from Mount Saint Vincent University in 1978 and another from Dalhousie University in 1987. In celebration of her 100th birthday, Oxfam Canada established the &quot;Jack and Muriel Duckworth Fund for Active Global Citizenship&quot; in recognition of Duckworth&#x27;s and her late husband&#x27;s leadership in working for social justice. Duckworth was awarded a posthumous Order of Nova Scotia on September 2, 2009.

==Death and legacy==
Duckworth fell and broke her leg in August 2009 while at her Quebec cottage. She was treated in hospital in Magog, Quebec, where her condition deteriorated. As she received palliative care, Duckworth reportedly told visitors, &quot;I&#x27;m going to leave you now. It&#x27;s time for me to go. Everything is ready.&quot; Then she added: &quot;Be happy with each other. You have each other. Goodbye, I&#x27;m going now.&quot; Her imminent death drew this comment from her friend, the well-known scholar and peace activist Ursula Franklin: &quot;I would like her to be remembered as somebody who demonstrated that it&#x27;s possible to change one&#x27;s society, to be profoundly critical and still remain a respected member of that society.&quot; Muriel Duckworth died on August 22, 2009, aged 100. Her biographer, Marion Douglas Kerans said, &quot;She showed women how to become true leaders in their community, and in the world, without losing any feminine grace.&quot;

<text>Woodley Park station (also known as Woodley Park–Zoo/Adams Morgan) is an underground station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro. Located at 24th Street and Connecticut Avenue Northwest, it serves the neighborhoods of Woodley Park and Adams Morgan in Northwest Washington.

==Station layout==

Woodley Park was the first in the system to deviate from the waffle-like coffers found at most underground stations in downtown Washington, instead using a simpler four-coffer arch. The advantage of the four-coffer arch was that it was pre-cast in Winchester, Virginia, and then hauled underground and installed on-site, while the waffle-style arches used in other stations had to be cast in place. This was done as a cost-saving measure.

Access to the station&#x27;s mezzanine is provided by two sets of three escalators, connected by a short walkway just underneath street level. The entrance is located at the southwest corner of Connecticut Avenue and Woodley Road. An elevator connects to the street with the mezzanine, which contains fare control and access to the island platform.

Like other stations on the Red Line constructed with rock-tunneling methods, it is rather deep, at below ground. After Forest Glen, it is the second deepest station in the system. The escalators have a vertical rise of ; they are the longest in the District of Columbia and the third longest on the Metrorail system (behind Wheaton and Bethesda). 
==History==

The station opened on December 5, 1981. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Dupont Circle station and the opening of the Cleveland Park and Van Ness–UDC stations.

Originally known as simply &quot;Zoological Park&quot;, in 1979 its name was changed to &quot;Woodley Park–Zoo&quot; because neighbors believed that the name was misleading, as the National Zoological Park is located from the station. The Adams Morgan neighborhood lies at the other end of the nearby Duke Ellington Bridge, and &quot;Adams Morgan&quot; was added to the station name in 1999 to reflect this. On November 3, 2011, the station was renamed to &quot;Woodley Park&quot;, with &quot;Zoo/Adams Morgan&quot; as a subtitle.

On November 3, 2004, an out-of-service train rolled backwards into the station and collided with an in-service train. The non-fatal collision injured about 20 people and caused $3.5 million in damages. An investigation determined that the operator of the runaway train was likely asleep.

The original escalators were replaced in 2015–18.

<doc id="559699" wikidata="Q1148334" url="?curid=559699" title="Tokyo Metropolitan University">
<text>, often referred to as TMU, is a public research university in Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan.

In contrast to other non-private universities in Tokyo, the university is established under the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and not the national government.

== Origin ==
The origin of Tokyo Metropolitan University was Prefectural Higher School, under the old system of education, established by Tokyo Prefecture in 1929 as the third public higher school. The School was modelled on Eton College, with three years of pre-university advanced course and four years of university regular course.

The seven-year system had the advantage of guaranteeing entrance to the Imperial universities at the age of Middle School. Before the end of the Second World War, many academic elite would start their post-primary education in Tokyo First Middle School, proceed to the First Higher School, and then enroll at Tokyo Imperial University.

Since the jurisdiction control of Tokyo First Middle School and First Higher School were different, however, Tokyo First Middle School attempted to originally establish the prefectural higher school, whereas the other Middle Schools opposed to the said attempt. Prefectural Higher School was established in 1929 located in the same site of Tokyo First Middle School, as a result of the opposition.

In 1932, Prefectural Higher School was relocated to 1–1–1 Yakumo, Meguro, and became known as one of the best higher schools with First Higher School. As the reign of Tokyo Metropolis was enacted in 1943, Prefectural Higher School was renamed to Metropolitan Higher School.

After the reform of the educational system in 1949, Tokyo Metropolitan University was established as a research university consisting of three faculties, namely Faculty of Humanities, Faculty of Science and Faculty of Technology; three years of advanced course was reorganized to Senior High School affiliated to Tokyo Metropolitan University, whereas four years of regular course was restructured into the university proper. Five Prefectural Colleges, namely Tokyo Prefectural College of Technology, Tokyo Prefectural College of Science, Tokyo Prefectural College of Machine Industry, Tokyo Prefectural College of Chemical Industry and Tokyo Prefectural College of Women were also merged with the Tokyo Metropolitan University. In 1957, Faculty of Law and Economics was separated from Faculty of Humanities, and then further divided into separate Faculty of Law and Faculty of Economics in 1966.

As expanding its organization, the university was relocated to 1–1–1 Minami-Osawa, Hachioji in 1991.

The university signed the student exchange agreement with University of Vienna in 1997.

Tokyo Metropolitan University was reformed in 2005 by integrating three metropolitan universities and one junior college: , , , and with subsequent change in its Japanese name, although its English name for the university has not changed since 1949.

== University reform ==
In the later 1990s, Government and local municipalities facilitated to reform of the administrative scheme and financial management in line with economic bubble burst and financial difficulties due to Japan&#x27;s progressive low birthrate and longevity. As a part of the said administrative and financial reform, social interest grew on restructuring national and public universities to independent administrative agencies with consolidating them. Tokyo Metropolitan University was also planned by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to be consolidated with the aforementioned three metropolitan universities and one junior college.

As a result of Tokyo gubernatorial election in April 2003, Shintaro Ishihara was re-elected as Governor of Tokyo, holding up a promise &quot;I will establish a revolutionary university&quot;, and consequently the original restructuring plan was significantly and rapidly changed, in terms of the organization of faculties, course structure, etc. During this process, several faculty members left the university as a sign of protest against the reform.

<doc id="559703" wikidata="Q2548809" url="?curid=559703" title="Cleveland Park station">
<text>Cleveland Park station is an underground rapid transit station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro. Located in the neighborhood of the same name in Washington D.C., it opened on December 5, 1981.

== Station layout ==
There are two entrances to the station, both on Connecticut Avenue but on opposite sides of the street between Ordway Street NW and Porter Street NW. Each of these street-level entrances contains an escalator and a staircase leading to an upper mezzanine that joins the two entrances underground. A set of three escalators descends to the station concourse, which houses fare control and ticket machines.

An escalator and staircase lead down from the fare gates to the platform. An elevator from street level to the concourse is available on the northeastern corner of the intersection of Connecticut Avenue NW and Ordway Street NW and an elevator is available between the concourse and platform after passing through the fare gates. Cleveland Park station has an island platform.

There are a pair of crossovers north of the station. Architecturally, Cleveland Park is similar to other stations along the underground stretch of the Red Line between Woodley Park and Medical Center. Because of the high cost of the waffle design and the relative large depth of these stations, pre-fabricated concrete segments were shipped to the construction site and placed together to form the structure of the station, resulting in a four-coffer station design.

==History==
While Cleveland Park was part of the initial system plan in 1959, the station opened on December 5, 1981, five years after the first segment began operations. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Dupont Circle station and the opening of Van Ness–UDC and Woodley Park stations.

On June 21, 2016, a heavy rainstorm with as much as of rain per hour at times produced flash flooding with a southerly flow along Connecticut Avenue. The north-facing Porter Street entrance was flooded, with water cascading down both the stairs and escalator for over 11 minutes. The escalator was not shut off and continued to run even while underwater at its base, however, no one was electrocuted.

The 5 escalators leading from the surface to the faregate mezzanine were replaced from June 2017 to February 2019. The station was closed from March 26 to June 28, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="559705" wikidata="Q5166847" url="?curid=559705" title="Coogan's Bluff">
<text>Coogan&#x27;s Bluff is a promontory near the western shore of the Harlem River in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan in New York City. Its boundaries extend approximately from 155th Street and the Macombs Dam Bridge viaduct to 160th Street, between Edgecombe Avenue and the river. A deep escarpment descends from Edgecombe Avenue to the river, creating a sheltered area between the bluff and river known as Coogan&#x27;s Hollow. From 1890 to 1964, the hollow was home to the Polo Grounds sports stadium.

==Namesake==
The promontory is named for James J. Coogan (1846–1915), a real estate developer and one-term Manhattan Borough President, who owned the land during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest known published reference to &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot; appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1893.

==Polo Grounds==
From 1890 until April 1964, the bluff overlooked the Polo Grounds, a professional sports venue that served as the home ballpark for Major League Baseball&#x27;s New York Giants from 1891 until the franchise&#x27;s move to San Francisco after the 1957 season. Sportswriters commonly used Coogan&#x27;s Bluff as a sobriquet for the Polo Grounds—as Chavez Ravine refers to Dodger Stadium and China Basin to Oracle Park—although the ballpark was actually situated in Coogan&#x27;s Hollow, the bottomland between the bluff and the river. The Coogan heirs continued to own the land on which the Polo Grounds stood even though the Giants owned the stadium. This stymied the Giants&#x27; efforts to maintain the stadium and was a factor in their decision to move to San Francisco after the 1957 season.

Before the opening of the first Yankee Stadium in 1923, the New York Yankees shared the Polo Grounds with the Giants for ten seasons (1913–22). For their first 31 years, the football Giants of the National Football League (NFL) played home games at the Polo Grounds (1925–55), then went to Yankee Stadium. After four seasons without a baseball team (1958–1961), the expansion New York Mets were tenants in 1962 and 1963, then moved to the new Shea Stadium in northern Queens in 1964. The New York Titans/Jets of the American Football League (AFL) played their first four seasons at the venue (1960–63), then also left for Shea in 1964.

 The Bushman Steps, located just west of Coogan&#x27;s Bluff in Sugar Hill/Hamilton Heights, led from the 155th Street subway station to the Polo Grounds ticket booths; the John T. Brush Stairway, on West 157th Street between St Nicholas Avenue and Edgecombe Avenue, then carried fans the rest of the way down to the stadium. The two stairways are the only intact structures that remain from the Polo Grounds era. The Brush Stairway was named in honor of the owner of the Giants franchise from 1890 until his death in 1912. The identity of the namesake of the Bushman Steps has apparently been lost.

==Housing complex==
The hollow, bordered by Frederick Douglass Boulevard, West 155th Street and Harlem River Drive, is currently home to the Polo Grounds Towers housing complex: four 30-story buildings containing a total of 1,616 apartments. The complex was completed on June 30, 1968, and is run by the New York City Housing Authority. Attached to Tower #2 is the Polo Grounds Community Center, run by Children&#x27;s Village, which hosts such programs as the Polo Grounds Youth Conference. A plaque on the property marks the approximate location of home plate within the demolished ballpark.

==Transportation==
Coogan&#x27;s Bluff can be reached via the New York City Subway&#x27;s 155th Street station, on the IND Concourse Line (). City bus routes service the area as well.

==Nearby points of interest==
The Morris-Jumel Mansion, the oldest house in Manhattan still standing (built in 1765 and now a museum) is located nearby, in Washington Heights. South of 155th Street, Coogan&#x27;s Bluff becomes a smaller cliff within Jackie Robinson Park.

Immediately across the Harlem River, in the Bronx, is Yankee Stadium, home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s New York Yankees.

<doc id="559711" wikidata="Q7913537" url="?curid=559711" title="Van Ness–UDC station">
<text>Van Ness–UDC station is a Washington Metro station serving the Forest Hills and North Cleveland Park neighborhoods of Washington, D.C., United States. The island platformed station was opened on December 5, 1981, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Red Line, the station is on the 4200 block of Connecticut Avenue NW, with exits on either side of the street. The station is also close to the University of the District of Columbia (UDC), as well as to both Howard University School of Law and the Edmund Burke School.

== Station layout ==
Van Ness–UDC station is the northernmost station in the tunnel beneath Connecticut Avenue, one of Washington&#x27;s busiest thoroughfares. After northbound trains leave the station, the tunnel shifts westwards underneath Yuma Street and at the next station, Tenleytown–AU, the tunnel then parallels the route of Wisconsin Avenue into Maryland.

Architecturally, Van Ness–UDC is similar to other stations along the underground stretch of the Red Line between Woodley Park and Medical Center. Because of the high cost of the four-coffer waffle design and the relative large depth of these stations, pre-fabricated concrete segments were shipped to the construction site and placed together to form the structure of the station. This resulted in what is now known as the &quot;Arch I&quot; station design of the Washington Metro.

Access to the station is provided by banks of escalators on either side of Connecticut Avenue, north of Veazey Terrace, which meet in an upper mezzanine and connect to a set of three long escalators to reach fare control. An elevator on the southwest corner of the intersection connects directly to the main mezzanine.

==History==
The station opened on December 5, 1981. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northwest of the Dupont Circle station and the opening of the Cleveland Park and Woodley Park stations. It would serve as the northwestern terminus of the Red Line until the opening of an extension to the then-named Grosvenor station on August 25, 1984.

<doc id="559712" wikidata="Q994197" url="?curid=559712" title="Niohuru">
<text>The Niohuru (Manchu: ; in Manchu) were a prominent Manchu clan during the Qing dynasty. The clan had inhabited the Changbai Mountains since as early as the Liao dynasty. The clan was well known during the Qing dynasty for producing a variety of consorts of all ranks for emperors, several of whom went on to become mothers to reigning emperors. Prominent people who belonged or trace heritage to the Niohuru clan including famed Manchu warrior Eidu, his son the high official Ebilun, the Empress Dowager Ci&#x27;an, the infamous corrupt official Heshen, the contemporary concert pianist Lang Lang and Lang Tsuyun (Ann Lang), Taiwanese TV, movie and stage actress, singer and producer.

== Distribution ==

Written records of the Niohuru clan dates back to the Liao dynasty (907–1125), when it was known as the &quot;Dilie&quot; clan (敌烈氏) by Chinese transliteration. The current transliteration Niohuru came into being during the Ming dynasty. The Niohuru clan inhabited the Changbai mountains region of present-day Jilin province in northeast China (otherwise known as &quot;Manchuria&quot;), and also on the banks of the Songhua River and Mudan River.

According to members of the clan who attempted to re-trace their genealogy, the common primogenitor of the vast tribe date back to one Sohoji Bayan (honorific &quot;Su Gung&quot;), who was six generations removed from Eidu, the first eminent Niohuru clan member in recorded Qing history. The Niohuru were widely distributed throughout the territory of the Manchu empire, and each of the Eight Banners had some Niohurus among their ranks.

Towards the end of the Qing dynasty and particularly after the founding the Republic of China in 1912, many Manchus adopted single-character Chinese surnames based on their clan origin. The Niohuru were known to have adopted to two versions, &quot;Niu&quot; (钮), which could be found in the modern province of Jiangxi in addition to Manchuria; and &quot;Lang&quot; (朗). Lang sounded like &quot;wolf&quot; in Chinese (狼), roughly corresponding to the Manchu root word &quot;Niohe&quot; for Niohuru meaning &quot;wolf&quot;.

Niu 钮 is on the Hundred Family Surnames poem.

<text>Nancy Meek Pocock, (October 24, 1910 – March 4, 1998), known as &quot;Mama Nancy&quot;, was a Canadian Quaker who was the 1987 recipient of the Pearson Medal of Peace for her work in disarmament, development and feminism. She was awarded the Order of Ontario in 1992.

==Biography==
===Early life and Career===
Nancy Pocock was born in Chicago as Anne Dorothy Meek. She was raised in both Illinois and Pennsylvania but by the age of ten has settled with her family in Toronto where she lived until her death in 1998. After graduating from Central Technical School she studied at the Ontario College of Art.

In 1930, she studied design and bench work in Paris, and upon returning to Toronto opened a jewellery studio on Gerrard Street which she shared with potter and friend Nunzio D&#x27;Angelo. Pocock (with Harold Stacey) was one of the founding directors of the Metal Arts Guild of Ontario and the only one to be described as a &quot;silversmith&quot; in its letters patent. Her work was included as part of the craft component for the Canadian Pavilion in the Universal and International Exhibition in Brussels in 1958. She later moved her studio to Yorkville, where she worked until 1970.

Pocock married her husband, Jack (John) Pocock, in 1944. While he served in World War II, she joined the Canadian Society of Friends (the Quakers), and soon he became a member as well. They helped establish the Grindstone Island programs, a series of seminars devoted to tackling the problems of war through peaceful means. 

Pocock was also a founding member of the Voice of Women and Project Ploughshares and was involved with the Canadian Peace Research Institute, the Canadian Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and a variety of Quaker peace projects including the Canadian Friends Service Committee. She was also a Quaker representative to the Inter-Church Committee on Refugees (ICCR) and co-ordinator of Toronto Refugee Affairs Council. Pocock committed much of her time to working with refugees during the Vietnam War by helping American draft dodgers and deserters as well as Vietnamese refugees find homes in Canada. She visited Vietnam four times, the first time during the war as a member of a Quaker committee sending aid to Vietnam. After the death of her husband in 1975, her work with refugees intensified and she expanded her scope of interest to include refugees from Latin and Central America.

Nancy Pocock was awarded the Medal of Friendship by Vietnam in 1978, the Pearson Peace Medal in 1987, an honorary doctorate of divinity from Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston in 1990, and the Order of Ontario in 1992.

===Death===
At age 86, she stated she would not retire. And indeed, she never did. Lying on a bed in the Emergency unit just days before she died, she continued to sign documents for an Iranian refugee. She passed on March 4, 1998.

<doc id="559728" wikidata="Q6826407" url="?curid=559728" title="Meyer Brownstone">
<text>Meyer Brownstone (June 26, 1922 – April 3, 2019) was a Canadian activist, civil servant, and academic, particularly notable for his longtime involvement with Oxfam Canada.

==Early life==
Brownstone was born in Winnipeg in 1922 to a poor Jewish socialist family. His parents were Olia Brownstone (née Roseman) and Charles Brownstone. His siblings were Hannah (married to Dr. Norman Hirt), Sam (married to Odette, parents of Justice Harvey Brownstone) and Shieky (married to Ellen).

In his youth, he worked in the gold mines of Red Lake, Ontario in order to pay for his schooling. Earlier, he had worked on his uncle&#x27;s farm where he tried to organize the Ukrainian women working in the field into a trade union, to his uncle&#x27;s dismay.

==Government of Saskatchewan==
From 1947 until 1964 Meyer Brownstone served as a civil servant in the government of Saskatchewan.

==Involvement with Oxfam==
Meyer Brownstone became the chair of Oxfam Canada in 1975. For his work with Oxfam Canada, he was the 1986 recipient of the Pearson Medal of Peace. Meyer was Chair Emeritus for Oxfam Canada at the time of his death.

===Central America===
Faced with the numerous conflicts in Central America in the 1970s and 1980s, Meyer Brownstone was deeply involved in the region. From 1981-1985, Brownstone participated in several observer missions to the refugee camps of Colomancagua, El Tesoro, Mesa Grande, and La Virtud in Honduras, documenting the life and struggles of the refugees fleeing the Salvadoran Civil War. He was head of a 1985 mission sponsored by Oxfam Canada and the International Committee of Voluntary Agencies to investigate reports of an assault by Honduran troops on the Salvadoran refugees at Colomancagua.

In 1986 and 1987 Brownstone participated in two missions to El Salvador, working with the Salvadoran government and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front. Brownstone also participated in Oxfam Canada missions in Nicaragua during this time.

===Namibia and South Africa===
During the dismantling of apartheid in South Africa and the South African administered territory of Namibia (then known as South-West Africa), Meyer Brownstone played a central role in a number of international observer missions. In July 1989, Brownstone was appointed spokesperson/coordinator of the Canadian Council on International Cooperation&#x27;s mission to Namibia. The primary goal of the mission was to monitor the withdrawal of South African troops following the end of the Namibian War of Independence. A few months later, Brownstone was appointed head of the Canadian mission that oversaw the first Namibian parliamentary election in November 1989.

In the lead up to the first South African election following the end of apartheid, Meyer Brownstone participated in two observer missions to South Africa. Brownstone and his team were tasked with increasing voter awareness, enlisting staff for the electoral process, determining the logistics for the election, and monitoring political violence. In 1994, Brownstone was appointed head of the Canadian mission to oversee the election itself. Among the Canadians on the mission were Ed Broadbent, former leader of the federal New Democratic Party, and Flora MacDonald, a former cabinet minister. The electoral mission was tasked with peace monitoring, election monitoring, advising and aiding the Independent Election Commission, and providing coordination with other international missions.

==Academic life==

Meyer Brownstone was sequentially Professor of Political Science at the University of Toronto, where he headed the Centre for Urban and Community Studies, and Professor of Environmental Studies at York University in Toronto. He had earned a PhD at Harvard University.

==Death==
Meyer Brownstone died in Toronto on April 3, 2019.

<doc id="559733" wikidata="Q678016" url="?curid=559733" title="Armand-Augustin-Louis de Caulaincourt">
<text>Armand-Augustin-Louis de Caulaincourt, duc de [[Vicenza|Vicence]] (, 9 December 177319 February 1827), was a French military officer, diplomat and close advisor to Napoleon I.

==Early life and family==

Armand de Caulaincourt was born into a noble family in the village of Caulaincourt, in the province of Picardy, northern France, on 9 December 1773. He was the eldest son of Marquis Louis-Gabriel de Caulaincourt (1740-1808) and Anne-Joséphine de Barandier de la Chaussé d&#x27;Eu (1751-1830), married in 1770. His father served in the French Army through the &quot;ancien régime&quot; and into the Republic, being made Count of the Empire by Napoleon shortly before his death in 1808. His grandfather, Marc-Louis de Caulaincourt, fought in the Third Silesian War and the Seven Years&#x27; War, reaching the rank of maréchal de camp.

==Military career==
Caulaincourt began his military service on 13 January 1788, at the age of 14, when he joined the Royal Foreign Cavalry Regiment (&quot;Régiment Royal Étranger Cavalerie&quot;) stationed in Arras, at the time commanded by Alexandre de Lameth, a distant relative. Six months after the start of the French Revolution, he was promoted to second lieutenant in the now renamed 7th Cavalry Regiment in November 1789. Two years later he was requested by his father to serve as his aide-de-camp, which was approved by Minister of war Louis Duportail in November 1791.

At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792 Caulaincourt had been promoted to captain and was serving as an adjutant on the staff of his uncle, Louis-Auguste Juvénal des Ursins d&#x27;Harville. His lineage as a noble made him suspect by the revolutionaries, causing Caulaincourt to volunteer to serve in the Paris National Guard as a common soldier. While on his way to join his regiment he was denounced as an aristocrat and thrown into prison. He escaped prison, and returned to serving in the army. In three years he had regained his previous rank and was serving General Lazare Hoche. He attained the rank of colonel in the Army of the Rhine. By 1801 Caulaincourt had been involved in thirteen campaigns and wounded twice.

==Diplomatic career==
Caulaincourt was fluent in a number of languages, including Russian. After the peace of Lunéville in 1801 he was sent to Saint Petersburg by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte. His mission was primarily to check British influence in the Russian court.

On his return he was named aide-de-camp of Napoleon. At this juncture an event occurred which was to profoundly affect his life. In 1804 Caulaincourt had been sent by Napoleon across the Rhine to seize some agents of the British government who were in Baden. He was used to pass on orders calling for the seizure and transport to Paris of Louis Antoine de Bourbon, the Duke of Enghien. Once in Paris the Duke of Enghien was tried for treason by a military tribunal and summarily executed. Caulaincourt, an aristocrat, had been used as a means to deliver a fellow aristocrat to his death. When Caulaincourt returned to Paris he learned of the Duke&#x27;s execution, and wept openly over it. He was incensed that he had been used in this way, and the event forever gave supporters of the Bourbon monarchy a means by which to impugn Caulaincourt&#x27;s integrity and honor. The shroud of idealism which had earlier colored his view of Napoleon was forever pulled away. From then on, though he treated Napoleon with courtesy, there was always a reserve, and he made a point to be frank in informing the Emperor of what he felt were the true motives behind the Emperor&#x27;s policies. The event was a point of shame that would haunt Caulaincourt for the rest of his days.
After the establishment of the empire he received various honors and in 1808 was given the title of &quot;Duke of Vicenza&quot;, a duché grand-fief. In 1807, Napoleon sent him as ambassador to St. Petersburg, where Caulaincourt endeavored to maintain the alliance of Tilsit between France and Russia. During this time he developed a friendship with the Tsar Alexander I. His tasks as ambassador included attempting to arrange a marriage between Napoleon and one of the sisters of the Tsar. Though nothing came of it, he was able to manage the negotiations without engendering an embarrassing rebuff upon the Emperor. In 1811, with Napoleon preparing to declare a change in policy with Russia, Caulaincourt was sent for to return to France. Napoleon wrote the Tsar to say the Duke was recalled to France because of the Duke&#x27;s &quot;poor state of health.&quot;

===Russian campaign===
In 1812, Caulaincourt strongly advised Napoleon against his proposed campaign into Russia. He was unsuccessful in dissuading the Emperor. He accompanied Napoleon as Grand Écuyer, or Master of the Horse, in which he was tasked with maintaining the horses of the Emperor and his close guard, and he had charge of the despatch riders and orderlies. He rode at the Emperor&#x27;s left side, and was prepared to surrender his horse to him in case there was need. He was with the Emperor at the Battle of Borodino, when Caulaincourt&#x27;s younger brother, Major-General Auguste-Jean-Gabriel de Caulaincourt, was killed while pressing forward the assault following the capture of the great redoubt.

During the French occupation of Moscow that followed, Caulaincourt repeatedly warned the Emperor of the dangers of wintering in Russia. The Emperor wanted to send him to St. Petersburg to negotiate terms of an armistice, but Caulaincourt declined, noting that the Tsar would not negotiate peace terms with the French while they were still in Moscow. During the subsequent French retreat from Moscow, Caulaincourt noted the disintegration of the army, and implored Napoleon to return directly to France to stabilize the political situation in Europe. Napoleon eventually did so, choosing Caulaincourt to travel alongside him in December 1812.

===Return to France===
The following month Caulaincourt was assigned the position of Grand Marshal of the Palace and charged with all diplomatic negotiations. He assumed this position following the death of the previous office holder, General Geraud Duroc. Caulaincourt signed the armistice of Pleswitz, June 1813, which suspended hostilities between France and Prussia and Russia for seven weeks. In the following negotiations, he represented France at the congress of Prague in August 1813, and at the Treaty of Fontainebleau on 10 April 1814. The provision for Napoleon on the island of Elba after his abdication is credited to Caulaincourt, who reportedly was able to influence the Tsar Alexander I for this disposition. During the First Restoration of the Bourbons that followed, Caulaincourt lived in obscure retirement.

With Napoleon&#x27;s escape from Elba and his regaining power in France, Caulaincourt was chosen to serve as Napoleon&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs. Caulaincourt tried to persuade Europe of the emperor&#x27;s peaceful intentions during the Hundred Days, but he was unsuccessful in this, culminating in the War of the Seventh Coalition. Following Napoleon&#x27;s second fall from power Caulaincourt&#x27;s name was on the list of those proscribed for arrest and execution in what came to be known as the Second White Terror during the Second Restoration of the Bourbons. His name was removed from the list by the personal intervention of the Tsar Alexander I.

==Later life==

Caulaincourt lived in retirement in Paris. Of the politicians of the First Empire, he was one of the most loyal and faithful to Napoleon. Caulaincourt&#x27;s name is engraved on the Arc de Triomphe&#x27;s West pillar, and a street in Paris is named Rue Caulaincourt in his honor. His eldest son served as a senator during the rule of Napoleon III. Caulaincourt died in Paris in 1827 at the age of 53, following an illness with cancer of the stomach, the same illness as his former employer.

==Memoir==
Caulaincourt had kept copious notes on his conversations with the Emperor Napoleon. In the 1820s a number of memoirs of the First Empire were published, written by individuals who had served with Napoleon. These seemed to rely on the retelling of events by Hugues-Bernard Maret, Duke of Bassano, who had served as a personal secretary of Napoleon. Caulaincourt believed these to be badly misrepresented conversations, individuals and events. In response Caulaincourt wrote his own memoir using his notes as reference. The work consisted of two independent parts. The first work records the discussions between the author and Napoleon just prior to the campaign in Russia, the events of the campaign, the occupation of Moscow, the fire that destroyed the city and the retreat that destroyed the Grande Armée. Following this is a recitation of Napoleon&#x27;s analysis of events and the world situation as told to the author in the course of their journey to Paris. The second part of the memoir covered the period of 1813 through Napoleon&#x27;s first abdication, and was still being worked upon at the time of the author&#x27;s death.

The publication of Caulaincourt&#x27;s memoir was delayed for a variety of reasons, and the work was eventually lost. Following the First World War the work was rediscovered, and efforts were made to prepare it for publication. After several years of work the entire memoir was published by Jean Hanoteau in 1933 with the title &quot;With Napoleon in Russia&quot;.

The work developed newfound significance with the events of the Second World War. Following the initial astonishing success of the German invasion of Russia in June 1941, military historian and theorist B. H. Liddell Hart coolly appraised the difficulties awaiting the Wehrmacht, citing Caulaincourt&#x27;s work extensively in an article he published in the British magazine &quot;The Strand&quot; in October 1941. After the war, it was learned that Caulaincourt&#x27;s &quot;With Napoleon in Russia&quot; was read with great interest by many German officers during their invasion of Russia. Friedrich von Mellenthin made reference to it in his memoir while describing the character of the Russian soldier, his stubbornness in defense, and his capacity to endure bombardments. General Günther von Kluge, commander of Army Group Center, reportedly often referred to the work. Liddell-Hart interviewed a great many German commanders after the war, and though Kluge did not survive he states General Günther Blumentritt recounted: &quot;I can still see von Kluge trudging through the mud from his sleeping quarters to his office, and standing there before the map with Caulaincourt&#x27;s book in his hand. That went on day after day.&quot;

Besides Liddell Hart, William Shirer, the author of the famous book, &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot;, also pointed briefly the impact of Caulaincourt&#x27;s memoirs in the chapter, &quot;A Turn of the Tide&quot;, when depicting the Battle of Moscow---

<text>Peter Craig Dutton (born 18 November 1970) is an Australian politician. He is the current Leader of the Opposition, holding office as the leader of the Liberal Party of Australia since May 2022. He has been the member of Parliament (MP) for the division of Dickson since 2001. Dutton previously served as the minister for Defence from 2021 to 2022 and the minister for Home Affairs from 2017 to 2021. He held various ministerial positions from 2004 to 2022 in the governments of Howard, Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison.

Dutton grew up in Brisbane. He worked as a police officer in the Queensland Police for nearly a decade upon leaving school, and later ran a construction business with his father. He joined the Liberal Party as a teenager and was elected to the House of Representatives at the 2001 election, aged 30. Following the 2004 election, he was appointed as Minister for Employment Participation. In January 2006, he was promoted to become Assistant Treasurer under Peter Costello. After the defeat of the Liberal-National Coalition at the 2007 election, he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Minister for Health, a role he held for the next six years.

Upon the victory of the Coalition at the 2013 election, Dutton was appointed Minister for Health and Minister for Sport. He was moved to the role of Minister for Immigration and Border Protection in December 2014, where he played a key role in overseeing Operation Sovereign Borders. He was kept in that position after Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott as Prime Minister in September 2015. In December 2017, he was also given the restored role of Minister for Home Affairs, heading a new &quot;super&quot; department with broad responsibilities brought together from other existing departments.

After the defeat of Abbott, Dutton became widely seen as the leader of the National Right faction in the Liberal Party, and began to be spoken of as a potential leader. In August 2018, after a period of poor opinion polling for the Coalition, Dutton unsuccessfully challenged Turnbull for the leadership. He then was defeated by Scott Morrison in a second leadership ballot days later after Turnbull chose to resign. He was retained as Minister for Home Affairs by Morrison, later becoming Minister for Defence and Leader of the House in March 2021. He went on to succeed Morrison as party leader unopposed after the Coalition&#x27;s defeat at the 2022 election, becoming leader of the opposition. He is the first Liberal leader to come from Queensland, and the first leader since Alexander Downer to represent a seat outside of New South Wales.

==Early years==
Dutton was born on 18 November 1970 in the northern Brisbane suburb of Boondall. Dutton is the great-great-grandson of the pastoralist squatter and politician Charles Boydell Dutton. He is also a descendant of Captain Richard James Coley, who was Queensland&#x27;s first Sergeant-at-Arms, who built Brisbane&#x27;s first private dwelling and who gave evidence confirming the mass poisonings of Aboriginal Australians at Kilcoy in 1842.

Dutton is the eldest of five children, with one brother and three sisters. His mother Ailsa Leitch worked in childcare and his father Bruce Dutton was a builder. Dutton finished high school at the Anglican St Paul&#x27;s School, Bald Hills. He worked cash in hand at a butcher shop during his school years, and his parents separated shortly after he graduated.

Dutton joined the Young Liberals in 1988 aged 18. He became the policy vice-chair of the Bayside Young Liberals the following year and chair of the branch in 1990. At the 1989 Queensland state election, the 19-year-old Dutton ran unsuccessfully as the Liberal candidate against Tom Burns, a former state Labor leader, in the safe Labor seat of Lytton.

===Police career===
Upon leaving high school, Dutton graduated from the Queensland Police Academy in 1990. He served as a Queensland Police officer for nearly a decade, working in the drug squad in Brisbane in the early 1990s. He also worked in the sex offenders squad and with the National Crime Authority.

In 1999, Dutton left the Queensland Police, having achieved the rank of detective senior constable. Documentation filed in the District Court of Queensland in 2000 describes his resignation as being prompted by a loss of driving confidence resulting from an incident in August 1998. He was driving an unmarked Mazda 626 during a covert surveillance operation, before rolling his car while in pursuit of an escaped prisoner who was driving erratically. Dutton also suffered numerous physical injuries during the accident, and as a result, was hospitalised briefly and bedridden for a week. He had sought damages of $250,000 from the escaped prisoner&#x27;s insurance company but dropped the claim in 2005.

===Business activities===
On leaving the police, Dutton completed a Bachelor of Business at the Queensland University of Technology. He and his father founded the business Dutton Holdings, which was registered in 2000; it operated under six different trading and business names. The company bought, renovated, and converted buildings into childcare centres, and in 2002 it sold three childcare centres to the now defunct ABC Learning. ABC Learning continued to pay rent of A$100,000 to Dutton Holdings. Dutton Holdings continues to trade under the name Dutton Building &amp; Development.

==Howard government (2001–07)==
===Backbencher, 2001–2004===

In early 2001, Dutton won Liberal preselection for the seat of Dickson in Brisbane&#x27;s northern suburbs, reportedly with the support of Liberal powerbroker Santo Santoro. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the 2001 federal election, aged 30. He defeated the high-profile incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) MP Cheryl Kernot, a shadow cabinet minister and former leader of the Australian Democrats, with Dickson regarded as a key target seat for the Coalition.

Dutton&#x27;s first overseas trip as an MP was a visit to the site of the September 11 attacks attacks in New York City. In his maiden speech in February 2002 he stated that the &quot;silent majority&quot; and &quot;forgotten people&quot; were dissatisfied with &quot;the boisterous minority and the politically correct&quot; and &quot;the dictatorship of the trade union movement&quot;. He was also critical of members of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, which he said were &quot;obsessed with the rights of criminals yet do not utter a word of understanding or compassion for the victims of crime&quot;.

Dutton had a relatively high profile as a first-term backbencher. He was appointed to the House Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in 2002 and served on an inquiry into family law and the Child Support Agency, where he advocated for lawyers to have less of a role in determining parental custody. The inquiry&#x27;s report was publicly criticised by Alastair Nicholson, the chief justice of the Family Court of Australia, who said its proposals were &quot;impractical and naive&quot;.

Dutton also spoke frequently on crime topics, including supporting the death penalty for the perpetrators of the 2002 Bali bombings and supporting legislation that would allow businesses to refuse service to drug addicts. In 2004, following the High Court decision in &quot;R v Carroll&quot;, he accompanied Faye Kennedy, the mother of murdered infant Deidre Kennedy, on a statewide tour to promote &quot;Deirdre&#x27;s Law&quot;, which sought to amend the double jeopardy provisions of Queensland&#x27;s criminal code.

===Minister, 2004–2007===
On 26 October 2004, Dutton was appointed Minister for Workforce Participation in the Howard government, following the Coalition&#x27;s re-election at the 2004 election. He was seen as politically close to Prime Minister John Howard. In July 2005, he was one of the few government ministers to support Howard&#x27;s suggestion that a national identity card be introduced as an anti-terrorism measure, with a number of cabinet ministers publicly opposing the idea.

Dutton was responsible for the government&#x27;s suite of &quot;welfare-to-work&quot; policies, which were intended to break generational poverty and welfare dependency. In November 2004, he flagged that the government would be looking at measures to encourage disability support pensioners to enter the workforce. The following year he announced that disability support pensioners deemed capable of working more than 15 hours per week would be moved to the Newstart Allowance. Changes were also made to rules to single parents, with recipients required to prove that they were not in a &quot;de facto&quot; relationship or face a reduced payment. In April 2005, Dutton announced that single parents would be required to seek employment once their youngest children entered school or receive a decrease in welfare payments. He stated that the changes were necessary to &quot;ensure welfare dependency is not entrenched&quot;.

Following a ministerial reshuffle, Dutton was appointed Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue on 27 January 2006. He had previously worked closely with Treasurer Peter Costello on the welfare reforms, and was reportedly a &quot;strident proponent&quot; of WorkChoices, the government&#x27;s industrial relations reform package. He successfully retained Dickson at the 2007 election, which saw the government lose office. However, his margin was reduced to 217 votes more than Labor&#x27;s Fiona McNamara.

==Opposition (2007–2013)==
Following the 2007 election, Dutton was promoted to shadow cabinet by the new Liberal leader Brendan Nelson, as Shadow Minister for Finance, Competition Policy and Deregulation. In 2008, he chose not to be present in the chamber during the apology to the Stolen Generations, which enjoyed bipartisan support. He said &quot;I regarded it as something which was not going to deliver tangible outcomes to kids who are being raped and tortured in communities in the 21st century.&quot; Later, in a 2014 interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, Dutton said he regretted boycotting the apology: &quot;I underestimated the symbolic and cultural significance of it.&quot; In 2023 Dutton apologised for skipping the apology, saying he &quot;failed to grasp&quot; its significance.

In September 2008, Nelson was replaced as Liberal leader by Malcolm Turnbull, who appointed Dutton as Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing. He retained that position when Tony Abbott succeeded Turnbull as leader in December 2009. In June 2010, Dutton released the Coalition&#x27;s mental health policy. &quot;The Australian&quot; described it as &quot;the most significant announcement by any political party in relation to a targeted, evidence-based investment in mental health&quot;, but not all experts agreed.

Dutton retained his seat with a positive swing at the 2010 federal election, despite an unfavourable redistribution. In the lead-up to the 2013 federal election, he announced a range of Coalition health policies, which were received favourably by industry groups. The Australian Medical Association said &quot;the Coalition has delivered a strong package of practical, affordable health policies that would strengthen general practice&quot;, while Cancer Council Australia said that &quot;Dutton&#x27;s promise to finalise the bowel cancer screening program by 2020 would save an additional 35,000 lives over the next 40 years.&quot;

===Attempted seat shift===
As the 2010 election approached, it looked like Dutton would lose to the Labor candidate due to a redistribution of division boundaries that had erased his majority and made Dickson notionally Labor. To safeguard himself, Dutton sought pre-selection for the merged Liberal National Party in the safe Liberal seat of McPherson on the Gold Coast (despite not living in or near McPherson). Some constituents complained, &quot;The abandoning of a seat by a sitting MP halfway through a parliamentary term to contest pre-selection in a seat over 100 kilometres to the south is not looked upon favourably.&quot;

Dutton lost the McPherson pre-selection to Karen Andrews, reportedly due to misgivings from former Nationals in the area. He then asked the LNP to &quot;deliver him a seat for which he does not have to fight other preselection candidates&quot;. Liberal MP Alex Somlyay (the chief Opposition whip of the time) said that Dutton&#x27;s expectation of an uncontested preselection was &quot;unusual&quot;. When the state executive did not provide Dutton an unchallenged preselection, Dutton reluctantly returned to campaign for the seat of Dickson. In the election, he won the seat with a 5.9% swing towards him.

==Cabinet minister (2013–2022)==
=== Minister for Health ===
Dutton retained his seat at the 2013 election. He was appointed to the new ministry by Prime Minister Tony Abbott as Minister for Health and Minister for Sport.

As Health Minister, Dutton announced the $20 billion Medical Research Future Fund. As announced, the capital and any ongoing capital gains of the Medical Research Future Fund will be preserved in perpetuity.

Under Dutton, projected funding in the health portfolio increased in the 2014–15 Budget to $66.9 billion, an increase of 7.5 percent from $62.2 billion in 2012–13, the final full year of the Labor government. Projected expenditure on Medicare increased over 9.5 percent from $18.5 billion in 2012–13 under Labor to a projected $20.32 billion in 2014–15 under Dutton. Funding for public hospital services increased by nearly 14 percent under Dutton in the 2014–15 Budget to a projected $15.12 billion compared to $13.28 billion in the last full year of the Labor government in 2012–13.

In a 2015 poll by &quot;Australian Doctor&quot; magazine, based on votes from over 1,100 doctors, Dutton was voted the worst health minister in the last 35 years by 46 percent of respondents.

=== Minister for Immigration (2014–17) ===
On 23 December 2014, Dutton was sworn in as the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection after a cabinet
reshuffle. In September 2015, Dutton cancelled the visa of anti-abortion activist Troy Newman, over remarks in his 2000 book &quot;Their Blood Cries Out&quot;.
In 2016, News Corp Sunday political editor Samantha Maiden wrote a column critical of Jamie Briggs. Dutton drafted a text message to Briggs describing Maiden as a &quot;mad fucking witch&quot; but inadvertently sent it to Maiden. Maiden accepted an apology from Dutton.

==== Sarah Hanson-Young spying incident ====
On 5 June 2015, Dutton denied claims made by Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young that she was spied on during a visit to Nauru. At the same time he called into question her credibility saying &quot;I have evidence that Senator Hanson-Young over-states every issue. She gets her facts wrong most of the time. And I just think you need to look at it in the light of experience with Senator Hanson-Young. If she&#x27;s got evidence, produce it.&quot; He also claimed that &quot;What Sarah Hanson-Young is about is publicity. She loves the camera and she loves to see her own name in the paper. That&#x27;s the start and finish of Sarah Hanson-Young.&quot; Hanson-Young responded that &quot;Peter Dutton can attack and insult me as much as he likes, but nothing will change the fact that my work has revealed systemic child abuse and the rape of young women on Nauru under his watch.&quot; The spying claims were later confirmed by the Immigration Department and Wilson Security who carried out the spying operation.

====Au pair cases====

In June 2015, an au pair who was detained at Brisbane Airport made a phone call and had her tourist visa reinstated. In November, in a second case, Dutton granted a visa to another au pair, despite his department warning him that she was at risk of breaching her work conditions on her tourist visa. Dutton indicated that he knew neither tourist. In August 2018, Roman Quaedvlieg indicated that he had personal knowledge of one of the cases, and was seeking to correct Hansard if it did not match his knowledge. A third au pair was granted a visa due to lobbying by AFL chief Gillon McLachlan, she was due to stay with his relative Callum Maclachlan. Dutton&#x27;s department again warned him there were indications that she was intending to work for Callum&#x27;s family. A Senate inquiry into two of the cases published a report on 11 September 2018. It recommended &quot;that the Senate consider censuring the Minister for Home Affairs (the Hon Peter Dutton MP) ... for failing to observe fairness in making official decisions as required by the Statement of Ministerial Standards.&quot;

==== Rising seas joke ====
On 11 September 2015, Dutton was overheard on an open microphone, before a community meeting on Syrian refugees, joking about rising sea levels in the Pacific Islands, saying: &quot;Time doesn&#x27;t mean anything when you&#x27;re about to have water lapping at your door&quot;. Dutton initially refused to apologise, saying it was a private conversation, but later apologised. The Foreign Minister of
the Marshall Islands at the time, Tony deBrum, responded by writing: &quot;insensitivity knows no bounds in the big polluting island down [south]&quot; and the &quot;Next time waves are battering my home [and] my grandkids are scared, I&#x27;ll ask Peter Dutton to come over, and we&#x27;ll see if he is still laughing&quot;.

==== Manus Island ====
On 15 April 2017 shots were fired by the Papua New Guinea defence force into the Manus Island Detention Centre. Dutton responded saying &quot;There was difficulty, as I understand it, in the community. There was an alleged incident where three asylum seekers were alleged to be leading a local five-year old boy back toward the facility and there was a lot of angst around that, if you like, within the local PNG community.&quot; &quot;I think there was concern about why the boy was being led or for what purpose he was being led away back into the regional processing centre. So I think it&#x27;s fair to say that the mood had elevated quite quickly. I think some of the local residents were quite angry about this particular incident and another alleged sexual assault.&quot;

However, the regional police commander on Manus Island said a young boy who was 10, not five, had gone to the centre two weeks earlier to ask for food. He said &quot;It&#x27;s a total separate incident altogether&quot; The Greens senator Nick McKim said Dutton had been caught telling an outrageous lie. &quot;This has disturbing echoes of the children overboard affair lies.&quot;

On 31 October 2017, the Papuan government closed down the Manus Island regional processing centre. However, 600 men residing in the processing centre refused to be moved to alternative accommodation in the town of Lorengau and staged a protest. Dutton defended the closure of the processing centre and asserted that the Papuan authorities had given notice of the camp&#x27;s impending closure in May 2017. He also rejected Australian Greens Senator Nick McKim&#x27;s report that there was no safe alternative accommodation available as false and claimed McKim was inciting trouble. Following a prolonged standoff with Papuan security forces, the remaining men were evacuated, many forcibly, to new accommodation. Arrangements have been made to resettle an unspecified number of the asylum seekers in the United States. The others will be moved to either a different part of Papua New Guinea or a different country.

In mid-November 2017, Dutton rejected an offer by the newly-elected New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to resettle 150 asylum seekers from the Manus Island detention centre in New Zealand and warned that it would have repercussions for the two countries&#x27; bilateral relations. He also claimed that New Zealand&#x27;s offer would encourage people smugglers. Dutton also criticised a New Zealand offer to provide $3 million for services for asylum seekers on Manus and Nauru as a &quot;waste of money&quot; that could be spent elsewhere, such as displaced people in Indonesia. In addition, Dutton criticised Australia&#x27;s Opposition Leader Bill Shorten&#x27;s call for Australia to accept the New Zealand offer as an attempt to appease the Labor Left with &quot;cheap political stunts and mealy-mouthed words&quot;.

=== Minister for Home Affairs (2017–2021) ===

On 20 December 2017, Dutton was appointed the Minister for Home Affairs with responsibilities of overseeing the Department of Home Affairs which was established on 20 December 2017 by Administrative Arrangement Order. The Home Affairs portfolio is a major re-arrangement of national security, law enforcement, emergency management, transport security, border control, and immigration functions.

==== South African farm attacks ====

In March 2018, Dutton made calls to treat white South African farmers as refugees, stating that &quot;they need help from a civilised country&quot;. However, his offer was rejected by Afrikaner rights organisation AfriForum, which stated that the future of Afrikaners was in Africa, as well as by the survivalist group the Suidlanders, which took credit for bringing the issue of a purported &quot;white genocide&quot; to international attention and for Dutton&#x27;s decision, and was met with &quot;regret&quot; by the South African foreign ministry. The Australian High Commissioner was subsequently summoned by the South African foreign ministry, which expressed its offence at Dutton&#x27;s statements, and demanded a &quot;full retraction&quot;.

His proposal got support from some of his party&#x27;s backbenchers and Liberal Democrat Senator David Leyonhjelm with Leyonhjelm later clarifying that he thought that South African farmers should be admitted under existing visa programmes, and could not be regarded as refugees. National Party of Australia MP Andrew Broad warned that the mass migration of South African farmers would result in food shortages in South Africa. Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema encouraged white farmers to take up Dutton&#x27;s offer. After initially leaving the door open to changes, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop subsequently ruled out any special deals for white South African farmers, emphasising the non-discriminatory nature of Australia&#x27;s humanitarian visa programme. In a subsequent interview, Dutton vowed to push forward with his plans, saying that his critics were &quot;dead to me&quot;.

In April 2018, it emerged that Dutton&#x27;s department had previously blocked asylum applications by a white farmer, and another white South African woman, with the decisions upheld by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

==== Immigration from New Zealand ====

As both Immigration Minister and Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton has defended an amendment to the Migration Act 1958 that facilitates the denial or cancellation of Australian visas for non-citizens on &quot;character&quot; grounds. This stringent &quot;character test&quot; also affects non-citizens who have lived most of their lives in Australia or who have families living in the country. New Zealand nationals living in Australia were disproportionately affected by this &quot;character test&quot; with over 1,300 New Zealanders having been deported from Australia in the period between January 2015 and July 2018. According to a Home Affairs Department report, 620 New Zealanders had their visas cancelled on character grounds in 2017 alone.

In July 2017, Dutton&#x27;s Department of Immigration and Border Protection introduced a special Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa to provide a pathway for New Zealanders holding a Special Category Visa to acquire Australian citizenship. The visa requires NZ nationals to have held a Special Category Visa for five years and to maintain an annual income of $53,900. Between 60,000 and 80,000 New Zealanders residing in Australia are eligible for the Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa. By February 2018, 1,512 skilled independent visas had been issued by late February 2018 with another 7,500 visas still being processed. The Skilled Independent subclass 189 visa was criticised by Australian Greens Senator Nick McKim as a stealth means of favouring &quot;English-speaking, white and wealthy&quot; migrants.

In February 2018, Dutton used his discretionary powers as Minister of Home Affairs to deport New Zealander Caleb Maraku on the grounds that he breached the &quot;character test&quot; provision of the Migration Act 1958. Maraku had been sentenced to 12 months probation for committing a one punch attack on another youth in Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast in November 2017. Maraku&#x27;s perceived lenient sentencing and insensitive behaviour following his sentence had drawn substantial media and public attention, including a 50,000 strong petition calling for his deportation. In response to Maraku&#x27;s case, Dutton stated: 

In early July 2018, Dutton ordered the deportation of controversial New Zealand Baptist Pastor Logan Robertson, who had disrupted services at two mosques in Kuraby and Darra in Brisbane. Dutton approved Robertson&#x27;s visa cancellation on the grounds that he had violated the conditions of his visa, stating that &quot;we have a wonderful tradition in our country of freedom of speech, but we&#x27;re not going to tolerate people going to a place of worship and harassing others.&quot; Robertson had early drawn controversy in New Zealand for his homophobic remarks and opposition to same-sex marriage.

In mid-July 2018, Dutton&#x27;s immigration &quot;character test&quot; became the subject of a controversial Australian Broadcasting Corporation documentary, entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Australia Home&quot;, focusing on New Zealanders who had been deported from Australia. In response, Dutton issued a tweet defending his deportation policy and claiming that deporting 184 &quot;bikies&quot; saved Australia A$116 million. In response, the New Zealand Minister of Justice Andrew Little, who also appeared in the documentary, criticised Australia&#x27;s deportation laws for lacking &quot;humanitarian ideals.&quot; The documentary&#x27;s release also coincided with the release of a 17-year-old New Zealand youth from an Australian detention centre, which had caused friction between the two governments. In response, Dutton defended his government&#x27;s policy of deporting non-citizen criminals and chastised New Zealand for not contributing enough to assist Australian naval patrols intercepting the &quot;people smugglers.&quot;

In mid-July 2019, Dutton defended Australia&#x27;s right to deport criminal non-citizens in response to concerns raised by the visiting New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, stating: In response, Professor Patrick Keyzer and Dave Martin of La Trobe University criticised Dutton&#x27;s pedophilia remarks as misleading and contended that most deportees from Australia had spent most of their lives in Australia and had little ties to New Zealand.

==== Protests ====
In October and November 2019, Dutton expressed his views on protesters and police response. He stated that when protesters break the law &quot;There needs to be mandatory or minimum sentences imposed... A community expectation is that these people are heavily fined or jailed.&quot; He also agreed with an on-air statement made by conservative 2GB radio presenter Ray Hadley that protesters should not receive social security payments. Leader of the Australian Greens Richard Di Natale responded by saying that &quot;Peter Dutton doesn&#x27;t know what living in a democracy means&quot; and claimed that he&#x27;s &quot;starting to sound more like a dictator than he is an elected politician. Because somebody says something that he doesn&#x27;t like, that he doesn&#x27;t support, he&#x27;s saying we&#x27;re going to strip away income support.&quot;

In November 2019, Dutton said that the States should make protesters pay for the cost of police response to demonstrations. He said of protesters: &quot;For many of them they don&#x27;t even believe in democracy... These people are completely against our way of life. These people can protest peacefully, as many people do, but the disruption that they seek to cause, the disharmony that they seek to sow within our society is unacceptable.&quot;

==== Policing ====
In December 2019, Dutton announced that airport security measures were to be increased to detect, deter and respond to potential threats to aviation safety. Measures include greater use of canines and the deployment of extra protective services personnel armed with MK18 short-barreled rifles. Dutton appeared in a video alongside police personnel to announce the policy, sparking criticism of the potential use of police for political purposes.

In March 2019, the Australian Federal Police Association had claimed that the AFP should be removed from the Department of Home Affairs to preserve its integrity and its ability to carry out investigations without government influence. Association president Angela Smith described it as &quot;an embarrassing situation... We look the least independent police force in Australia, surely the other police forces are laughing at us.&quot;

====Leadership challenges====

On 21 August 2018, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called a snap ballot of the leadership of the Liberal Party following several days of feverish leadership speculation, of which Dutton was at the centre. Dutton responded to Turnbull&#x27;s ballot call by formally challenging for the leadership of the party and won 35 of 83 votes available, 7 short of a majority. Dutton then resigned from the Ministry despite being offered by Turnbull to retain his position of Minister for Home Affairs, and the media speculated that Dutton and his conservative backers in the party were likely to challenge for the leadership again in the near future. 

On 22 August 2018, described what his policies would be if he were to be elected leader of the Coalition. These included scrapping the GST on electricity, which Scott Morrison described as &quot;an absolute budget blower&quot;. Dutton also floated the idea of having a royal commission into electricity companies.

Three days later, Dutton called for another leadership spill, and Malcolm Turnbull tendered his resignation to the Governor-General. Dutton was defeated by Treasurer and Acting Home Affairs Minister Scott Morrison by 45 votes to 40.
Doubts surrounding Dutton&#x27;s eligibility to be elected to parliament emerged on the grounds of section 44(v) of the Australian Constitution, as the family trust owned by Dutton operated a child care centre that received over $5.6 million in funding from the Commonwealth government, in a situation similar to Bob Day&#x27;s case. Although Dutton had received legal advice stating that he was not in breach of section 44(v), Labor had received contrary advice; at Turnbull&#x27;s request, the Attorney-General referred the matter to the Solicitor-General. On 23 August, Labor attempted to move a motion to refer Dutton&#x27;s eligibility as an MP to the High Court, in a similar manner to referrals made during the recent parliamentary citizenship crisis. The motion failed by 69 votes to 68. On 24 August, the Solicitor-General advised that in terms of section 44(v) Dutton was &quot;not incapable&quot; of sitting as an MP, although he added that he had been provided with limited factual information and that, owing to differences of judicial opinion in earlier decisions of the High Court on section 44(v), Dutton&#x27;s legal position could not be entirely clear without a referral to the High Court.
Dutton was reappointed to his former Home Affairs portfolio by Scott Morrison in the Morrison Ministry; however, responsibility for Immigration was stripped from the role and was assigned to David Coleman.

====2019 federal election====
Dutton was re-elected at the 2019 federal election. The political think tank GetUp! identified Dutton as &quot;Australia&#x27;s most unwanted hard-right politician&quot; after surveying more than &quot;30,000 members&quot;. GetUp! mounted a campaign in an attempt to defeat Dutton in Dickson. In response, Dutton said GetUp! was, &quot;deceptive&quot;, &quot;undemocratic&quot; and &quot;unrepresentative&quot; and that he would back &quot;parliamentary processes to bring the activist group to heel.&quot; GetUp! has defended the effectiveness of its campaigning in Dutton&#x27;s electorate.

=== Minister for Defence (2021–22) ===

In March 2021, Dutton was appointed Minister for Defence. On 21 May 2021, Dutton directed the department and serving military personnel to stop pursuing a &quot;woke agenda&quot;, and cease holding events to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia and Transphobia where staff wore rainbow clothing.

On 11 July 2021, Dutton announced the end of Australia&#x27;s military presence in Afghanistan.

In October 2021, Dutton said Australia will back up any U.S. effort to defend Taiwan if China attacks. In November 2021, he branded the former Prime Minister Paul Keating as &quot;Grand Appeaser Comrade Keating&quot;.

==== Defamation case ====
On 16 June 2021, in the Federal Court, Justice Richard White ordered Dutton to attend mediation over a defamation suit he brought against refugee activist, Shane Bazzi over a tweet calling him a &quot;rape apologist&quot;. In August 2021, it was announced this mediation had failed.

On 24 November 2021, White ruled in Dutton&#x27;s favour and awarded $35,000 in defamation damages, but refused Dutton&#x27;s bid for an injunction to prevent Bazzi tweeting about him.

This decision was overturned on 17 May 2022 by the Full Court of the Federal Court, which found that the words &quot;rape apologist&quot;, taken in the context of the whole message together with the &quot;Guardian&quot; article to which it was linked, referred to Dutton&#x27;s attitude not to rape itself but toward claims of having been raped and accordingly did not amount to defamation.

== Leader of the Opposition (2022–present) ==

The Coalition was defeated at the 2022 federal election, with Dutton retaining his seat despite a swing against him. After Scott Morrison resigned as leader of the Liberal Party, Dutton was elected unopposed as the new leader, with Sussan Ley elected as deputy.

In parliament, in December 2022, Dutton repeatedly, after multiple corrections, referred incorrectly to Sharon Claydon as &quot;Mr Speaker&quot;.

On 1 April 2023, a by-election was held in the seat of Aston, triggered by the resignation of Liberal MP Alan Tudge. In a surprise result, the Labor candidate Mary Doyle won the election, marking the first time since 1920 that an Australian government had won a by-election from the opposition. Having said during the campaign that the result would be a &quot;verdict on the leaders&quot;, Dutton said afterwards that he accepted responsibility for the result, but still deserved to remain Liberal leader.

In April 2023, Dutton announced that the Liberal Party would be opposing the 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum. Although members of the Liberal frontbench will be forced to adopt this position, party backbenchers are free to campaign for the referendum.

Dutton&#x27;s stance on the referendum was immediately met with opposition from within the Liberal Party. On 6 April, former Liberal MP Ken Wyatt resigned from the party in protest. The following week, shadow Attorney-General Julian Leeser quit the Liberal frontbench and moved to the backbenches so he could freely campaign in favour of the referendum. The next day, Simon Birmingham, the leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, also announced that he would not be adopting the party position.

Following a shadow cabinet reshuffle, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price was appointed the shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians on 18 April 2023.

Following allegations of sexual harassment and assault made by independent Senator Lidia Thorpe, Dutton removed Liberal Senator David Van from the Liberal party room on 15 June 2023.

In August 2023, Dutton said that ballot counting rules in the upcoming 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum were &quot;rigged&quot;, attracting criticism from MPs (see ).

On 3 September 2023, Dutton committed to hold a second referendum on Indigenous recognition if the Voice referendum failed, while also expressing support for his party&#x27;s election proposal for a series of legislated local bodies (without a national one). However, following the defeat of the Voice proposal, Dutton stated that his party&#x27;s prior commitment to symbolic constitutional recognition would be reviewed and that &quot;it&#x27;s clear the Australian public is probably over the referendum process for some time&quot;.

On 10 January 2024, Dutton called for a boycott of Woolworths after it confirmed that it will no longer stock Australia Day-themed merchandise due to reduced sales over recent years.

In July 2024, Dutton&#x27;s remarks relating to Fatima Payman were characterised by Laura Tingle as &quot;an example of how to surgically hit every hot-button issue in one short grab for the cameras&quot; (see ).

On 29 July 2024, Dutton arrived in Israel for a three-day visit reimbursed by the Australia/Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council. He met Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials.

=== Home Affairs revelations ===
In 2023-24, a number of stories regarding Dutton&#x27;s leadership of the Department of Home Affairs reached the public for the first time. It was revealed that a 2020 report had uncovered serious issues with the department&#x27;s detention approach, but Dutton had chosen not to act.

In February 2024, the independent Richardson Review was published, which uncovered a number of damning failures of governance at the Department of Home Affairs while Dutton was Minister. It was revealed that under Dutton&#x27;s leadership:

* The department had made multi-million dollar contracts with companies suspected of criminal activity, including drug smuggling, corruption, and bypassing US sanctions.
* Dutton had personally intervened with the department to allow a criminal to stay in Australia, stating that it would be in the public interest.
* The department had made an extremely lucrative contract with Paladin without a competitive tender process, and despite the company being registered to a beach shack on Kangaroo Island. In two separate cases, KPMG had audited the wrong company when undergoing financial audits of contractors.
An editorial in &quot;The Age&quot; noted that the Department seem to lack accountability, with nobody found responsible for any of the failings. However, media outlets including News Corporation and the ABC largely ignored the scandal.

At the same time, the Department was involved in another scandal, when $80M intended for Papua New Guinea disappeared. The payments were in return for resettling refugees from Manus Island, however, service providers stopped receiving payments in 2022, and neither government could explain why.

Shortly after these revelations, a group of 30 men arrived in Australia by boat. Dutton blamed the Albanese government, and misleadingly claimed that Labor had cut $600M from Operation Sovereign Borders.

==Political positions==
Dutton is aligned with the &#x27;National Right&#x27; faction of the Liberal Party, which he leads. He has been described as a right-wing populist. Dutton is opposed to an Australian republic. In December 2018, Dutton told Sky News that for the prior seventeen years he had regarded &quot;parliament as a disadvantage for sitting governments&quot;.
===Age verification===
In 2024, Dutton supported moves for age verification in social media.

===Drug prohibition===
On 26 September 2019, one day after the partial decriminalisation of personal cannabis use by the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) government, Dutton called the decision &quot;unconscionable&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot; in a 2GB interview.

In September 2023, Dutton characterised ACT legislation on the limited decriminalisation of illicit substances as &quot;crazy&quot;, saying that Canberra would become a &quot;boom market&quot; for drug gangs.
===Indigenous flags===
In December 2024, Dutton stated his opposition to flying the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags alongside the national flag, viewing them as &quot;a symbol of division&quot; and saying that he would remove them from the official Australian government press conferences.

===Education===
In 2018, Dutton expressed support for school-aged children to be required to make a pledge similar to an Oath of Allegiance.
===Energy and emissions===
In a July 2023 address to the Institute of Public Affairs, Dutton argued for the adoption of nuclear power, calling it &quot;the only feasible and proven technology&quot; that can &quot;firm up renewables and help us achieve the goals of clean, cost effective and consistent power&quot;. ABC journalist Monte Bovill characterised it as &quot;ramping up calls for nuclear power in Australia&quot;. Dutton claimed that small modular reactors could be installed at decommissioned coal power plants, saying, &quot;We can convert or repurpose coal-fired plants to use the transmission connections that already exist on those sites.&quot;

In October 2023, he expressed opposition to a proposed off-shore wind farm of New South Wales&#x27; Hunter Region, saying that the environmental impacts to &quot;rare bird species&quot; and the seabed were unknown. &quot;We&#x27;re all in favour of renewable energy, but not at any cost, and not where you&#x27;re destroying jobs and livelihoods and the environment&quot;, Dutton remarked.

In February and March 2024, Dutton expressed opposition to Labor&#x27;s proposal to introduce new vehicle fuel efficiency standards. He called it &quot;Mr Albanese&#x27;s new ute tax and new family car tax&quot;. Dutton said that the proposal would increase the price of new vehicles.

Asked at a press conference on 12 March 2024 regarding the annual &quot;GenCost&quot; report from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) identifying nuclear reactors as being more expensive than fossil fuels and renewable sources, Dutton called the report &quot;discredited&quot; and said that it was &quot;well documented&quot; that the CSIRO was unreliable. CSIRO chief executive Doug Hilton repudiated the allegations.

In November 2022, former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull called Dutton&#x27;s claims about the necessity of nuclear power &quot;complete and utter nonsense&quot;.

On 23 September 2024, Dutton remarked in a speech, &quot;Labor tells you that renewables and nuclear can&#x27;t work together. It&#x27;s utter nonsense.&quot;

=== Migrants ===

==== Humanitarian entrants ====
Before the 2016 election, Dutton voiced opposition to proposals to increase humanitarian visas, saying it could lead to large numbers struggling to integrate. &quot;For many people, they won&#x27;t be numerate or literate in their own language let alone English&quot;, Dutton remarked, adding &quot;These people would be taking Australian jobs, there&#x27;s no question about that.&quot; Turnbull defended Dutton by stating he is an &quot;outstanding Immigration Minister&quot;.

==== Muslim LebaneseAustralians ====
Asked in November 2016 during question time to clarify his earlier controversial comments regarding the &quot;mistakes&quot; made by the Malcolm Fraser government &quot;in bringing some people in&quot;, Dutton replied that the majority of people charged with terrorist-related offences were &quot;from second and third generation LebaneseMuslim background&quot;. Tony Burke criticised Dutton, saying that Australian security agencies &quot;would be devastated and shocked that a minister would do that&quot;. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop defended Dutton, saying that he was referring to the lack of &quot;significant services&quot; in Fraser&#x27;s time, and specifically to people charged with terrorism offences, &quot;He made it quite clear that he respects and appreciates the contribution that the Lebanese community make in Australia.&quot; According to former national security official Clark Jones, Dutton&#x27;s remarks risked &quot;creating the terrorists of the future&quot;.

On 25 November 2016, 30 Lebanese organisations met in Auburn to discuss the issue. According to &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald &quot; (&quot;SMH&quot;), Dutton was criticised for reversing &quot;years of hard work in building cohesion&quot; and &quot;belittling the entire community&quot;. One anonymous group leader characterised the comments as &quot;a smear on the 99.99 per cent of Australian Lebanese Muslims who are resiliently getting on with life despite the constant attacks on their identity&quot;. He added, &quot;If Mr Dutton wants to play this game perhaps he can release the top three cultural backgrounds of the perpetrators of domestic violence, drunken assaults, paedophilia and rape. He might find the numbers slightly over representative of his own cultural cohort white males.&quot; The Lebanese Muslim Association (LMA) demanded Dutton to either meet with community groups for an &quot;open discussion&quot;, or &quot;remain silent&quot;.

In a 2023 episode of &quot;Kitchen Cabinet&quot;, Annabel Crabb asked Dutton about the 2016 comments. He replied, &quot;I have apologised for that&quot;. Asked by the &quot;SMH&quot; in August and September 2024, various community leaders said they were unaware of an apology; one likened the 2016 comments to Dutton&#x27;s 2024 comments on Gazan refugees. However, Rifi expressed gratitude for Dutton&#x27;s efforts to repatriate Australian orphans from Syria, saying &quot;The guy is not heartless&quot;.

Lech Blaine, author of a 2024 &quot;Quarterly Essay&quot; piece about Dutton, said that she was unaware of an apology. Mehal Krayem, co-author of a 2019 paper on the subject of Dutton&#x27;s comments and the media framing, doubted the existence of an apology. According to the &quot;SMH&quot;, no apology was identified after searches of newspaper archives, Dutton&#x27;s Twitter publications and speech transcripts on his website. One day after the &quot;SMH&quot; article was published, Dutton said at a press conference that he had apologised to an unnamed &quot;senior person&quot;.

==== &quot;African gang violence&quot; in Victoria ====

In January 2018, Dutton said that people in Melbourne were scared of going out because of &quot;gang violence&quot; involving African Australians. In an ABC interview, Jason Wood, Liberal MP representing the Division of La Trobe, repudiated suggestions that the rhetoric was an attempt at attracting race-baced votes. Wood referred to the statistics he had obtained in a parliamentary migration inquiry. &quot;News.com.au&quot; reported that Dutton was &quot;ridiculed&quot; by Melbourne social media users. Dutton&#x27;s comments formed part of a wider media discourse linking African immigrants to crime in Melbourne dating back to 2016, when individuals associated with the predominantly African Apex gang rioted at the Moomba Festival. According to a 2019 study by Monash University, Dutton&#x27;s remarks followed a &quot;flurry of &#x27;sensationalist&#x27; media pieces about &#x27;African gangs&#x27; in Melbourne&quot; and members of the African-Australian community felt &quot;stigmatised and labelled because of their race and perceived association with criminality&quot;.

In 2020, Malcolm Turnbull expressed regret over defending Dutton for his comments at the time, suggesting that he was &quot;too trusting&quot; and that he used to attribute the &quot;sometimes offensive remarks&quot; from Dutton to &quot;verbal clumsiness and awkwardness&quot;.

==== White South African farmers ====

In 2018, Dutton supported the intake of White South African victims of farm attacks. He described the circumstances as &quot;horrific&quot;. BBC News reported that the message of &#x27;white genocide&#x27;, which had been promoted by the extremist Suidlanders, had resonated with Dutton, who claimed he was considering the provision of fast-track visas to white South African farmers. Dutton referred to the farmers as being &quot;persecuted&quot; and needing help from a &quot;civilised&quot; country. Australian Greens leader Richard Di Natale denounced the proposal as racist, saying that it would be a return to the White Australia Policy.

==== &quot;Anchor babies&quot; ====
In September 2019, Dutton characterised the two children of the Biloela family asylum claimants detained at Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation as &quot;anchor babies&quot; who were being used to &quot;leverage a migration outcome based on the children&quot;.

==== Muslim political alliance ====
In July 2024, Dutton remarked about Fatima Payman&#x27;s departure from the Labor Party. To &quot;Nine News&quot;, Dutton said that whilst he did not &quot;have any problem with a party that has a religious view&quot;, there were &quot;all sorts of problems&quot; with supporting &quot;a Palestinian cause or a cause outside of Australia&quot; as &quot;a first order of priority&quot;. At a press conference on 4 July, Dutton said of prime minister Anthony Albanese, &quot;if he&#x27;s in a minority government in the next term of parliament, it will include the Greens, it&#x27;ll include the Green-teals, it&#x27;ll include Muslim candidates from Western Sydney, it will be a disaster.&quot; Laura Tingle characterised the remarks as &quot;an example of how to surgically hit every hot-button issue in one short grab for the cameras&quot;. Usman Khawaja called his comments &quot;an absolute disgrace&quot; and &quot;bigotry at its finest&quot;, contending that he was &quot;fuelling Islamophobia from the very top&quot;.

==== Gazan migration ====
On 14 August 2024, Dutton criticised the Labor government in a Sky News Australia interview over what he saw as inadequate vetting of people fleeing from Gaza, saying that he did not think &quot;people should be coming in from that war zone at all at the moment&quot; and that he thought &quot;it puts our national security at risk&quot;. He contended that Australians &quot;would be shocked to think that the government&#x27;s bringing in people from a war zone&quot; and asserted that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was &quot;not conducting checks and searches on these people&quot;. Later that day, Anthony Albanese reacted in an ABC &quot;News Breakfast&quot; interview, saying that Dutton &quot;always seeks to divide&quot;. He said that the government took advice from intelligence agencies and not &quot;from someone always looking for a fight, always looking for division&quot;.

===Negative gearing===
Dutton opposes any changes to negative gearing which offers tax breaks to property investors, saying in May 2017 that changing it would harm the economy. He owns six properties with his wife, including a shopping centre in Townsville.

===LGBT rights===
In March 2017, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported Dutton had privately expressed the view that the legal recognition of same-sex marriage was inevitable, and that he contended that the Coalition taking the initiative was better than allowing Labor to oversee the process.

In March 2017, 31 CEOs signed a letter to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull calling for a free vote in the Australian Parliament on same-sex marriage. In response to this letter, on 16 March, Dutton said that the CEOs &quot;shouldn&#x27;t shove their views down our throats&quot; and that CEOs who were &quot;doing the wrong thing&quot; should &quot;be publicly shamed&quot;. Dutton repeated his criticism at a speech to the LNP State Council in Queensland on 18 March. The &quot;Herald&quot; then reported that &quot;the forcefulness of Mr Dutton&#x27;s attack on corporate chief executives last weekin which he told them to &quot;stick to their knitting&quot;has aroused suspicion among some colleagues who believed he was committed to achieving a breakthrough on [same-sex marriage]&quot;. The following month, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Dutton was asked by a lesbian for clarification on his position, and he &quot;told her he had been clear that he was against same-sex marriage&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The Conversation&quot;, Michelle Grattan remarked, &quot;those calling for more free speech are squealing increasingly loudly when others exercise their freedom in a way they don&#x27;t like&quot;, comparing Dutton&#x27;s public confrontation against his stance on Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Former New South Wales Premier Kristina Keneally commented in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;In Dutton&#x27;s Australia [...] Free speech is great and should be expanded, unless it&#x27;s an Australian corporate CEO speaking about same-sex marriage. Then they need to shut up.&quot; Simon Birmingham expressed disagreement with Dutton&#x27;s comments.

On 28 September 2017, following the news that US rapper Macklemore would sing a pro-marriage equality song at the NRL Grand Final, Dutton said in the name of free speech that &quot;two songs should be played, one for gay marriage and one against gay marriage&quot;.

After becoming Liberal leader in 2022, Dutton stated &quot;We are the Liberal Party. We believe in families – whatever their composition.&quot;

After US President Donald Trump signed an executive order which stated that the United States federal government will only recognize two genders, male and female, Nationals leader David Littleproud called on Australia to adopt a similar policy. Dutton dismissed Littleproud&#x27;s comments saying that &quot;We don&#x27;t have any plans to change our position in relation to that issue.&quot;

=== Voting ===
In August 2023, Dutton said that ballot counting rules in the upcoming 2023 Australian Indigenous Voice referendum were &quot;rigged&quot;, referring to the possibility for certain ticks in addition to writing &quot;yes&quot; to be sporadically treated as valid responses. In response, the Australian Electoral Commission stated that they rejected the assertions &quot;completely and utterly&quot;. Senators David Pocock and Sarah Hanson-Young called the allegations a &quot;new low&quot;. Independent MP Monique Ryan remarked that Dutton &quot;will do anything, even undermine faith in our democratic processes, to score cheap political points&quot;. Rachel Withers, writing in &quot;The Monthly&quot;, characterised the claims as &quot;Trumpian&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dutton married his first wife when he was 22 years of age; the marriage ended after a few months. His eldest child, a daughter, was born in 2002 to another partner, and split time between her parents in a shared parenting arrangement. In 2003, Dutton married his second wife, Kirilly (), with whom he has two sons.

On 13 March 2020, Dutton announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19, becoming the first federal cabinet member to do so.

Dutton suffers from the skin condition alopecia totalis.

Dutton supports the Brisbane Broncos in the National Rugby League, but also backed the eventually successful membership bid for a second Brisbane team in the league (the Dolphins). In the Australian Football League, he supports the Brisbane Lions.

<doc id="559740" wikidata="Q459438" url="?curid=559740" title="Proton magnetometer">
<text>A proton magnetometer, also known as a proton precession magnetometer (PPM), uses the principle of Earth&#x27;s field nuclear magnetic resonance (EFNMR) to measure very small variations in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, allowing ferrous objects on land and at sea to be detected. 

It is used in land-based archaeology to map the positions of demolished walls and buildings, and at sea to locate wrecked ships, sometimes for recreational diving.

PPMs were once widely used in mineral exploration. They have largely been superseded by Overhauser effect magnetometers and alkali vapour (caesium, rubidium, and potassium) or helium magnetometers, which sample faster and are more sensitive.

== Principles of operation ==
A direct current flowing in a solenoid creates a strong magnetic field around a hydrogen-rich fluid (kerosine and decane are popular; water can also be used), causing some of the protons to align with that field. The current is then interrupted, and as protons realign themselves with the magnetic field, they precess at a frequency that is directly proportional to the magnetic field. This produces a weak rotating magnetic field that is picked up by a (sometimes separate) inductor, amplified electronically, and fed to a digital frequency counter whose output is typically scaled and displayed directly as field strength or output as digital data.

The relationship between the frequency of the induced current and the strength of the magnetic field is called the &quot;proton gyromagnetic ratio&quot;, and is equal to 0.042576 Hz nT−1. Because the precession frequency depends only on atomic constants and the strength of the ambient magnetic field, the accuracy of this type of magnetometer can reach 1 ppm.

The frequency of Earth&#x27;s field NMR for protons varies between approximately 900 Hz near the equator to 4.2 kHz near the geomagnetic poles. These magnetometers can be moderately sensitive if several tens of watts are available to power the aligning process. If measurements are taken once per second, standard deviations in the readings is in the 0.01 nT to 0.1 nT range, and variations of about 0.1 nT can be detected.

For hand/backpack carried units, PPM sample rates are typically limited to less than one sample per second. Measurements are typically taken with the sensor held at fixed locations at approximately 10 meter increments.

The main sources of measurement errors are magnetic impurities in the sensor, errors in the measurement of the frequency and ferrous material on the operator and the instruments, as well as rotation of the sensor as a measurement is taken.

Portable instruments are also limited by sensor volume (weight) and power consumption. PPMs work in field gradients up to 3,000 nT m−1 which is adequate from most mineral exploration work. For higher gradient tolerance such as mapping banded iron formations and detecting large ferrous objects Overhauser magnetometers can handle 10,000 nT m−1 and Caesium magnetometers can handle 30,000 nT m−1.

==Proton magnetometer in archaeology==

In 1958 Glenn A. Black and Eli Lilly, following the work of Martin Aitken and his associates at the Oxford University (UK) Archaeometric Laboratory, used proton magnetometers to locate and map buried archaeological features, including iron objects in the soil, thermoremanent magnetization of fired clays, and differences in the magnetic susceptibility of disturbed soils. During 1961–1963, they surveyed more than of the Angel Mounds State Historic Site in Indiana and excavated more than to match anomalous magnetometer readings with the archaeological features that produced them. This was the first systematic use of a proton magnetometer for archaeological research in North America.

<text>Lois Miriam Wilson ( Freeman; April 8, 1927 – September 13, 2024) was a minister of the United Church of Canada who served as the first female Moderator of the United Church (1980–1982), the first woman president of the Canadian Council of Churches (1976–1979), and the first woman president of the World Council of Churches (1983–1991). Wilson also served in the Canadian Senate for four years (1998–2002).

==Early life and education==
Lois Miriam Freeman was born in Winnipeg in 1927, the daughter of the Rev. E.G.D. (Gard) Freeman, a minister, and Ada Freeman, a teacher. Lois was born into the United Church of Canada — her father had been a Presbyterian minister, but had become a minister of the newly formed United Church when Methodists, Presbyterians and Congregationalists had amalgamated two years before Lois&#x27;s birth. Her father would go on to became a professor and dean of theology at United College, Winnipeg.

Lois followed her father&#x27;s footsteps, attending United College and graduating from the University of Winnipeg with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1947 and a Master of Divinity in 1950. While attending university, she was active in the Student Christian Movement of Canada as Student President in Manitoba (1944–46) as well as on the national level, and remained active later in life in the World Student Christian Federation. She also attended Theological Seminary in New York. Following graduation in 1950, she married Roy Wilson.

==Minister==
Wilson was ordained a minister in the United Church of Canada in 1965, her husband Roy having previously been ordained a United Church minister. She served in team ministry with her husband in United Church pastoral charges in Winnipeg, (1954–60), Thunder Bay, (1960–69), Hamilton (1969–78) and Kingston (1978–80).

From 1983 to 1989 she served as co-director of the Ecumenical Forum of Canada and also served as the first woman president of the Canadian Council of Churches (1976–1979) as well as the first woman president of the World Council of Churches (1983–1991).

==Moderator==
At the 28th General Council of the United Church in 1980, Wilson was elected as the 28th Moderator, becoming the first woman to serve in that role since the founding of the United Church. Julie McGonegal, writing for &quot;Broadview&quot;, noted that during her time as Moderator, &quot;Wilson brought an unprecedented focus on peace, environmental stewardship and human rights. Her leadership style was confident yet collaborative and informed by her belief that faith communities should be at the forefront of social change. To that end, Wilson led the United Church into deeper conversations about nuclear disarmament, gender equality and the elimination of poverty, both at home and abroad.&quot;

==Public service==
From 1967 to 1968, Wilson was the director of Town Talk, Thunder Bay, an innovative ecumenically sponsored program, utilizing all media, inviting citizens to publicly discuss issues affecting the future of their city. In 1984, she was a commentator for the CBC during the Apostolic Visit of Pope John Paul II to Canada.

From 1990 to 2000, Wilson was the Chancellor of Lakehead University.

In 1998 Wilson was appointed to the Senate of Canada upon the recommendation of then prime minister Jean Chrétien, and served in the chamber as an Independent. In 2000, she led Canada&#x27;s first parliamentary delegation to North Korea to begin the process of establishing formal diplomatic relations. She retired from the Senate in 2002.

Wilson held several other Canadian government appointments, including as Canada&#x27;s envoy to Sudan, and as a panel member of Environmental Assessment of the Disposal of Nuclear Waste (1989–1997).

She also served as Ecumenist in Residence at the Toronto School of Theology, a Fellow of Massey College, International Co-President of the World Federalist Movement. 

At the time of her death, she was Distinguished Minister in Residence at Emmanuel College at Victoria University in the University of Toronto.

==Author==
Wilson was the author of ten books including, &quot;Turning the World Upside Down: A Memoir&quot; (Toronto: Doubleday Canada, 1989) and &quot;I Want to Be in That Number - Cool Saints I Have Known&quot; (Toronto: self-published, 2014). She also wrote the first chapter of &quot;Transforming the Faiths of our Fathers: Women who Changed American Religion&quot; (2004), edited by Ann Braude.

==Personal life and death==
Roy and Lois Wilson, married in 1950, had four children, twelve grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

A close friend of novelist Margaret Laurence, Wilson participated in several public forums with Laurence and presided at Laurence&#x27;s 1986 funeral.

Wilson died at a hospital in Fredericton, New Brunswick, on September 13, 2024, at the age of 97.

==Awards==
Wilson received 14 honorary degrees for her work in human rights, ecumenism, and social justice, including one from the United States. She also received a number of other honours and awards: 
* Queen&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Medal (1977), 
* Pearson Peace Medal (1985), 
* Officer of the Order of Canada (1984) and Companion of the Order of Canada (2003)
* Order of Ontario (1991) 
* Joseph Cardinal Bernardin Award for Christian Unity (2010), 
* Heart and Vision Award (2011).
* Wilson was a director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, who honoured her in 2014 for her public engagement.

<text>Huka Falls is a set of waterfalls on the Waikato River, which drains Lake Taupō in New Zealand.

A few hundred metres upstream from Huka Falls, the Waikato River narrows from approximately 100 metres across to a canyon only 15 metres across. The canyon is carved into lake floor sediments laid down before Taupō Volcano&#x27;s Oruanui eruption 26,500 years ago.

The volume of water flowing through often approaches 220 cubic metres per second, making it one of the highest flowing waterfalls in the world. The flow rate is regulated by Mercury NZ Ltd through the Taupō Control Gates as part of their hydro system planning, with Waikato Regional Council dictating flows during periods of downstream flooding in the Waikato River catchment. Mercury NZ have ability to control the flows between 50 cubic metres per second and 319 cubic metres per second.

At the top of the falls is a set of small waterfalls dropping about eight metres. The final stage of the falls is a six-metre drop, raised to an effective 11 metre fall by the depth of the water. The falls are a popular tourist attraction, being close to Taupō and readily accessible from State Highway 1.

<text>&quot;Chaucer&#x27;s Retraction&quot; is the final section of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. It is written as an apology, where Geoffrey Chaucer asks for forgiveness for the vulgar and unworthy parts of this and other past works, and seeks absolution for his sins.

It is not clear whether these are sincere declarations of remorse on Chaucer&#x27;s part or a continuation of the theme of penitence from The Parson&#x27;s Tale. It is not even certain if the retraction was an integral part of the Canterbury Tales or if it was the equivalent of a death bed confession which became attached to this his most popular work.

<doc id="559749" wikidata="Q500237" url="?curid=559749" title="George Ignatieff">
<text>Count George Pavlovich Ignatieff, (; 16 December 1913 – 10 August 1989) was a Russian-born Canadian diplomat. His career spanned nearly five decades in World War II and the postwar period.

==Early life and education==
Count Ignatieff was born in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, the youngest of five sons, to a distinguished Russian noble family. His mother was Princess Natalia Nikolayevna Meshcherskaya and his father was Count Pavel Ignatiev, a close advisor to Tsar Nicholas II serving as his last Minister of Education. In 1918, the year after the Russian Revolution, Count Ignatieff was imprisoned, but his release was negotiated by sympathetic supporters. The family fled to France, and later moved to Canada. George Ignatieff was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London, Lower Canada College, and the University of Trinity College, University of Toronto, before being awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford.

==Wartime service and postwar diplomacy==
With the advent of war, Ignatieff joined the Royal Artillery, where he worked in photographic intelligence. In 1940 he joined the Canadian Department of External Affairs. He became personal assistant to the Canadian High Commissioner in London, Vincent Massey, and during his London posting began a friendship with Lester Pearson, later Prime Minister of Canada. Ignatieff also served as the wartime Canadian delegate to the International Red Cross.

Ignatieff was a key figure in Canadian diplomacy and international relations through the postwar period. He was Ambassador to Yugoslavia (1956–1958), permanent representative to NATO (1963–1966), Canadian Ambassador to the United Nations (1966–1969) and president of the United Nations Security Council (1968–1969). In 1984 Ignatieff was appointed Ambassador for Disarmament by Prime Minister John Turner.

Ignatieff was unimpressed by the foreign policy of the Trudeau governments of the 1970s and 1980s, and was unafraid to provoke government functionaries. He advocated cautious realignment of Canadian defence policy, and a complete nuclear test ban. Like his mentor Pearson, Ignatieff believed in the interdependence of nations, and had an acute prescience for the impending threats of terror, economic breakdown, and environmental degradation.

Ignatieff served as Provost of the University of Trinity College from 1972 to 1979, and later as chancellor of the University of Toronto from 1980 to 1986. The University of Trinity College&#x27;s theatre is named after Ignatieff, and is fondly known as the GIT (pronounced &#x27;jit&#x27;).

George Ignatieff has been described as the &quot;best Governor General (Canada) never had&quot;. His autobiography, &quot;The Making of a Peacemonger&quot;, was published in 1985 by the University of Toronto Press.

==Personal life==

Ignatieff married Alison Grant (the granddaughter of George Monro Grant and niece of Vincent Massey) in 1944, and had two sons. The elder, Michael Ignatieff, was Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada and Leader of the Official Opposition from 2008 to 2011. Andrew Ignatieff was a community worker and assisted in his brother&#x27;s leadership campaign.

==Awards and honorary degrees==

Ignatieff was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1973. He received the Pearson Medal of Peace for his work in international service in 1984. He received eight Honorary Degrees from Canadian universities.

* Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario (LL.D) on 27 May 1969

<doc id="559750" wikidata="Q1443220" url="?curid=559750" title="Frank Fahey (politician)">
<text>Frank Fahey (born 6 June 1951) is an Irish property developer and former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources from 2000 to 2002 and as a Minister of State in various roles. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Galway West constituency from 1982 to 1992 and 1997 to 2011. He was a Senator for the Labour Panel from 1993 to 1997.

==Life before politics==
Frank Fahey was born in June 1951 in Galway. He was educated at St Mary&#x27;s College, Our Lady&#x27;s College and University College Galway. He was a schoolteacher before he entered politics.

==Ministerial career==
Fahey was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the February 1982 general election. In 1987, he was appointed by the government of Charles Haughey to the post of Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for Youth and Sport. He was re-appointed in July 1989, with additional responsibility as Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport from September 1989. He was not retained as a minister when Albert Reynolds came to office in February 1992.

He lost his Dáil seat at the 1992 general election and was appointed to Seanad Éireann, serving in the 20th Seanad until 1997. He returned to the Dáil at the 1997 general election and in the new government of Bertie Ahern, he was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility as Minister of State for Children. The role was expanded in 1998 with additional appointments as Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science and at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In January 2000, he was appointed to cabinet as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.

Following the re-election of the incumbent government at the 2002 general election, Fahey was demoted to the post of Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for Labour Affairs. In a reshuffle in 2004, he was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with responsibility for Equality.

He was re-elected at the 2007 general election but not appointed to any ministerial office. He was, however, appointed to head the joint Oireachtas committee on Transport.

==Controversies==

===Lost at Sea scheme===
While Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in 2000, Fahey launched the &quot;Lost at Sea&quot; scheme to compensate fishermen whose vessels had been lost at sea. In 2004, following a complaint from a late applicant (who had been turned down), the Ombudsman Emily O&#x27;Reilly recommended to the department that latecomers should be considered, saying that the schemes had a &quot;serious defect&quot; in having contacted some fishing families and not others. Via a freedom of information request, &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot; found that Fahey had discussed the scheme with two constituents, who later received three quarters (around €2m) of the overall compensation, prior to the announcement - and had written to them about their successful applications prior to the closing date. In 2007, the Standards in Public Office Commission found no problems with Fahey&#x27;s conduct. In 2009, the Ombudsman published a full report into the scheme, again recommending that late applicants receive compensation, but it was blocked from discussion in the Oireachtas by the government.

===Corrib gas project===
In 2000, one of Fahey&#x27;s last acts as Minister of State for the Marine and Natural Resources was to approve the foreshore licence for the controversial Corrib gas project. In 2002, in connection with this project, he approved the sale of a large area of Irish national forestry at Bellanaboy to Shell Oil for the building of a gas processing site, which caused much controversy.

==Investments and property==
&quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported in 2006 that in 1994, when Fahey was a senator, he became involved in establishing a hair and beauty salon business in Moscow, involving an investment of over £200,000 (€254,000). Fahey did not officially declare the interest and at first denied involvement with the salon. Later, he admitted a connection, saying he had travelled to Moscow &quot;as an ordinary citizen to support the investors including my wife who were attempting to set up a hair salon there...the whole thing was part of a regional political campaign by a number of individuals to do damage to my integrity, character and good name&quot;.

Fahey has invested in properties in countries including Ireland, France, the US, Dubai and Belgium. He also declared an interest in a construction company and a share portfolio in the Dáil Register of Members Interests.

In June 2009, Green Party leader Trevor Sargent accused Fahey in the Dáil of tax avoidance and making inappropriate decisions as a minister, and called on the Taoiseach to sack him.

==Loss of seat==
The 2011 general election was disastrous for Fianna Fáil and Fahey lost his seat, his first preference vote declining to 5.7%. He had said in November 2010: &quot;I have no illusions that I will lose my seat&quot;. During a public meeting in the run up to the election he and government advisor Alan Aherne were booed and heckled.

<text>Georges-Henri Lévesque (February 16, 1903 – January 15, 2000) was a Canadian Dominican priest and sociologist and a liberal figure during the conservative Duplessis era in Quebec.

==Biography==
Born in Roberval, Quebec, the son of Georges Lévesque and Laura Richard, he was ordained into the priesthood in 1928. He studied philosophy and theology at the Dominican College in Ottawa and social sciences at the School of Social Sciences of the Université Catholique de Lille (France).

Lévesque was a professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences of Université de Montréal from 1935 until 1938 and a professor of social philosophy at Laval University from 1936 until 1962.

In 1938, Lévesque founded the School of Social, Political and Economic Sciences of Laval University and was its first director from 1938 until 1943. The school became the Faculty of Social Sciences in 1943, and he was its first dean, from 1943 until 1955.

Lévesque founded the Quebec Superior Council of Cooperation and was its first president, from 1939 until 1944. He founded the periodical &quot;Ensemble!&quot; and was its director, from 1939 until 1944. He was a member of the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences in Canada (1949–1951). He was vice-president of the Canada Council for the Arts (1957–1962). He represented Canada at several international events. In 1963, he founded the National University of Rwanda and he was its first president, from 1963 until 1971.

Lévesque supported the co-operative movement and, through his faculty, helped create new social welfare bodies such as the Conseil supérieur de la coopération and the Société d&#x27;éducation des adultes, and to modernize Québec&#x27;s church-controlled social welfare organizations. As well, his Faculty of Social Science trained a generation of union organizers. His liberal and social democratic ideas and work brought him into constant conflict with the government of Premier Maurice Duplessis and he is seen as one of the fathers of the Quiet Revolution that transformed Quebec society after Duplessis&#x27;s death.

In 1955, Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent approached Lévesque about naming him to the Senate of Canada as a non-partisan appointee. Lévesque agreed and the Dominican Order gave its permission but the appointment was vetoed by Archbishop Maurice Roy due to concerns that allowing a priest to accept a political appointment could potentially embarrass the Church.

==Honours==
* He was the 1983 recipient of the Pearson Medal of Peace for his work in peacekeeping.

<doc id="559753" wikidata="Q57276" url="?curid=559753" title="Michael D. Higgins">
<text>Michael Daniel Higgins (; born 18 April 1941) is an Irish politician, poet, broadcaster, and sociologist who has been serving as the ninth president of Ireland since 2011. 

Entering national politics through the Labour Party, he served as a senator from 1973 to 1977 having been nominated by the Taoiseach. Elected in 1981 as a Teachta Dála (TD), he represented the Galway West constituency from 1981 to 1982 and 1987 to 2011. Between these terms, he returned to Seanad Éireann from 1983 to 1987 as a senator for the National University. He served as minister for arts, culture and the Gaeltacht from 1993 to 1997 and mayor of Galway from 1981 to 1982 and 1990 to 1991. Higgins was the president of the Labour Party from 2003 to 2011, until he resigned following his election as president of Ireland.

Higgins has used his time in office as president to address issues concerning justice, social equality, social inclusion, anti-sectarianism, anti-racism, and reconciliation. He made the first state visit by an Irish president to the United Kingdom in April 2014.
Higgins ran for a second term as president of Ireland in 2018 and was re-elected in a landslide victory. Higgins attained the largest personal mandate in the history of the Republic of Ireland, with 822,566 first-preference votes. Higgins&#x27;s second presidential inauguration took place on 11 November 2018.

==Early life==
Higgins was born on 18 April 1941 in Limerick. His father, John Higgins, was from Ballycar, County Clare, and was a lieutenant with the Charleville Company, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Cork Brigade of the Irish Republican Army. John, along with his two brothers Peter and Michael, had been active participants in the Irish War of Independence.

When John&#x27;s father&#x27;s health grew poor, with alcohol abuse as a contributing factor, John sent Michael, aged five, and his four-year-old brother to live on his unmarried uncle and aunt&#x27;s farm near Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare. His elder twin sisters remained in Limerick. He was educated at Ballycar National School, County Clare and St. Flannan&#x27;s College, Ennis.

As an undergraduate at University College Galway (UCG), he served as vice-auditor of the college&#x27;s Literary and Debating Society in 1963–64, and rose to the position of auditor in the 1964–65 academic year. He also served as president of UCG Students&#x27; Union in 1964–65. In 1967, Higgins graduated from the American Indiana University Bloomington with a Master of Arts degree in sociology. He also briefly attended the University of Manchester.

In his academic career, Higgins was a statutory lecturer in the Department of Political Science and Sociology at UCG and was a visiting professor at Southern Illinois University. He resigned his academic posts to concentrate fully on his political career.

Higgins is a fluent Irish language speaker and also speaks Spanish.

==Family life==
His wife, Sabina Higgins (née Coyne), is an actress and a native of Cloonrane, a townland in County Galway near Ballindine, County Mayo. She grew up on a farm there in a family of five girls and two boys.

Higgins met Coyne in 1969, at a party in the family home of journalist Mary Kenny in Dublin. Higgins proposed over Christmas 1973, and they married on 8 July 1974 at Haddington Road Church in Dublin. They celebrated 50 years of marriage in 2024. They have four children: Alice-Mary, Daniel, and twins, John and Michael Jr.; Alice-Mary was elected to Seanad Éireann in 2016. He has a Bernese Mountain Dog named (Courage). He previously had two Bernese dogs named and , who died in 2020 and 2023 respectively.

==Political career (1973–2011)==
===Seanad and Dáil Éireann===
Higgins originally joined Fianna Fáil in UCG while a mature student and was elected its branch chairman in 1966; he switched to the Labour Party shortly thereafter. He was a Labour candidate in the 1969 and 1973 general elections but was unsuccessful on both occasions. One of the people who canvassed for him was future leader of the Labour Party and Tánaiste, Eamon Gilmore, who was then a UCG student. Higgins was appointed to the 13th Seanad in 1973 by Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1981 general election as a Labour Party TD. He was re-elected at the February 1982 election; he lost his seat at the November 1982 election (blaming his loss in part on his opposition to the Eighth Amendment), but returned to the Seanad when he was elected by the National University constituency. He served as Mayor of Galway on two occasions, 1982–1983 and 1991–1992. Within the Labour Party during the 1980s he was one of the main figures, along with Emmet Stagg, who opposed going into coalition.

Higgins returned to the Dáil at the 1987 general election and held his seat until the 2011 general election. In 1993, he joined the cabinet as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. During his period as minister he scrapped Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, re-established the Irish Film Board and set up the Irish language television station, Teilifís na Gaeilge (later renamed TG4). He was appointed to the Labour Party front bench in 2000. In 2003, Higgins succeeded Proinsias De Rossa in the symbolic position of the president of the Labour Party, while continuing as the party&#x27;s spokesman on foreign affairs.

Higgins indicated his interest in contesting the 2004 presidential election for the Labour Party. The party decided on 16 September 2004 against running a candidate in the election, seeing Mary McAleese as unbeatable.

In October 2010, he announced he would not be standing at the 2011 general election. He had until this point been living in a two-bed apartment at Grattan Hall on Mount Street, Dublin. He also has a family home in Galway.

===2011 presidential campaign===
In September 2010, Higgins indicated that he was interested in receiving the Labour Party&#x27;s nomination for the 2011 presidential election. He said prior to and during the election campaign that he would serve only one seven-year term as president, and not seeking a second term of office if elected.

He was selected as a candidate for the presidency at a convention in Dublin on 19 June 2011, beating former senator Kathleen O&#x27;Meara and former party adviser Fergus Finlay. His candidacy was endorsed by Hollywood actor Martin Sheen, who described Higgins as a &quot;dear friend&quot;. Higgins assisted his rival David Norris by urging his party colleagues on Dublin City Council &quot;in the interests of democracy&quot; not to obstruct Norris&#x27;s attempts to get onto the ballot at the last moment, adding that the nomination criteria were &quot;outdated&quot;.

Higgins was confronted by former Tara mines workers while canvassing in County Meath. The workers were upset about their pensions being cut. Higgins was also pursued by his past links to Fianna Fáil, and admitted on 13 October that he had been elected chairman of the UCG Fianna Fáil university cumann in 1966. He admitted that he had smoked marijuana while at university in the United States. However, media reports said he was &quot;spared the intense grilling Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan meted out to some of the others&quot; during the &quot;Prime Time&quot; debate. Higgins promised he would be a neutral president if elected and not be a &quot;handmaiden&quot; to the government. The Labour Party&#x27;s budget for the campaign was within €320,000.

On 29 October 2011, two days after the presidential election was held, Higgins was declared the winner with a total of 1,007,104 votes, far more than any Irish politician in the history of the republic. Thousands of people lined the streets of Galway to welcome him home the following day. International media coverage of his win reported his humble background, poetry and intellect, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noting &quot;local satirists sometimes depict him as an elf, hobbit or leprechaun talking in riddles and verse&quot;. He is the first president of Ireland to have served in both Houses of the Oireachtas, having previously been a member of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.

Before his inauguration, Higgins and his family met his predecessor Mary McAleese and her husband Martin for lunch at Áras an Uachtaráin on 3 November. That night, he presented an award to Niall Tóibín, and received his own standing ovation as he entered the Irish Film Institute. On 5 November, he attended an important football game, featuring Galway United versus Monaghan United in the second leg in the League of Ireland promotion/relegation play-off at Terryland Park, wrapped in the scarf of his favourite team, and being greeted by a large banner hanging from a stand declaring &quot;Welcome home to Galway, Mr President&quot;.

==Presidency==
===First term (2011–2018)===
Higgins was inaugurated as president of Ireland at Dublin Castle on 11 November 2011. The ceremony had a humanist element, alongside Christian, Jewish and Muslim ones. He receives an annual salary of €250,000, having requested during his first term that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform reduce his salary by 23.5% from €325,000.

Higgins travelled to Derry to attend the final of the All-Ireland School Choir of the Year competition on 13 November 2011 for his first official presidential engagement in Northern Ireland. In December 2011, he hosted a children&#x27;s tea party at Áras an Uachtaráin. He attended the Bon Secours Hospital in Galway on 13 December for surgery on the kneecap that was broken in a fall during a visit to Buenaventura, Colombia in 2010.

Higgins made his first official trip abroad when he went to London on 21 February 2012. While there he was given a tour of the Olympic Stadium by Sebastian Coe, and attended a production of &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot; at the Lyttelton Theatre. He made his first official visit to his &quot;alma mater&quot; NUI Galway on 24 February, where he opened an autism centre. On 21 March 2012, Higgins was announced as sole patron of the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra. Addressing a conference organised by youth organisation Foróige on 24 March 2012, Higgins described homophobia and racism in Ireland as a &quot;blight on society&quot;.

In January 2012, Higgins agreed to become the patron of Clans of Ireland, including its Order of Merit. On the president&#x27;s behalf, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport Leo Varadkar, awarded &quot;Companionship&quot; in this Order of Clans of Ireland to several nominees at a ceremony in the Mansion House, Dublin on 28 April 2012. On 11 May 2012, he became the 28th Freeman of Galway. In June 2012, nonprofit housing organisation Habitat for Humanity Ireland announced that Higgins would be their sole Patron. In October 2012, Higgins and his wife Sabina went to South America for a two-week trip, visiting Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Higgins rushed home from a visit to Rome, Italy, to sign the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Bill 2013 into law at Áras an Uachtaráin early on 7 February 2013, on the urgent request of the Government of Ireland. On 29 July 2013, he convened a meeting of the Council of State, the first of his presidency, to consult on the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013.

Special advisor to the president, Mary van Lieshout, who formed part of the management team in Áras an Uachtaráin under Secretary General Adrian O&#x27;Neill, resigned in November 2013. The departure raised criticism over presidential management of the team. The presidential Christmas messages delivered by Higgins from 2011 to 2013 did not mention Christianity or religion, which was criticised by the Defence Forces&#x27; chaplain in a homily on Christmas Eve 2013. The Chief of Staff expressed regret for any offence caused by the chaplain.

In April 2014, Higgins paid the first state visit to the United Kingdom by an Irish president. He stayed as a guest of Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle and . He also met various people, including British prime minister David Cameron and opposition party leaders at Westminster, and the lord mayor of London, Alan Yarrow. In December 2014, Higgins made a week-long state visit to China.

In November 2016, Higgins received criticism from some sections of the Irish media for praising Fidel Castro, saying in a statement that he learned of Castro&#x27;s death with &quot;great sadness&quot;.

On 25 August 2018, Higgins received Pope Francis at Áras an Uachtaráin during the Pope&#x27;s visit to Ireland.

===Second term (2018–present)===
On 10 July 2018, Higgins announced that he would stand for a second term as president in the 2018 Irish presidential election, despite having previously stated during the campaign for his first term that he would not. Higgins won the 2018 presidential election with 56% of the vote on the first count (822,566). His nearest rival, Peter Casey, finished on 23% (342,727).
On 11 November 2018, Higgins was inaugurated as president of Ireland in St. Patrick&#x27;s Hall, Dublin Castle, in a ceremony attended by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, and former presidents Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese, as well as representatives of all political parties. The ceremony was held in the evening so that Higgins could attend Armistice Day commemorations in the morning.

On 3 July 2019, Higgins began a three-day state visit to Germany. While visiting Germany, Higgins met with German chancellor Angela Merkel and President of Germany Frank-Walter Steinmeier.

In July 2021, Higgins sent a letter to the Oireachtas expressing concern that there had been a tendency in recent years for him to be sent a large volume of complex legislation to be signed quickly.

On 15 September 2021, Higgins declined an invitation to attend a church service with Britain&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth in October to mark Northern Ireland&#x27;s centenary. Two days later on 17 September, Higgins defended his decision not to attend the service and decided it would be &quot;inappropriate to attend&quot;. Pope Francis described Higgins as a &quot;wise man of today&quot; during an audience in the Vatican.

On 15 June 2022, Higgins described housing in Ireland as &quot;our great, great failure,&quot; saying, &quot;It isn&#x27;t a crisis anymore — it is a disaster.&quot;

On 19 September 2022, Higgins was among 500 presidents, prime ministers, foreign royal family members and dignitaries who attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.

On 24 January 2023, Higgins began a five-day state visit to Senegal, his first time in Africa since 2014. While visiting Senegal, Higgins met with Senegalese president Macky Sall.

On 13 April, Higgins received U.S. President Joe Biden at Áras an Uachtaráin during his four-day visit to the island of Ireland.

On 28 April, Higgins made a speech from Áras an Uachtaráin in which he criticised economists for being &quot;obsessed&quot; with economic growth and consumption and for promoting &quot;neoliberalism&quot;. The same speech urged economists to be more environmentally conscious and to imagine a greener future. The speech was criticised by Irish economists, who responded by arguing that Higgins&#x27;s criticisms were outdated by several decades and that the study of economics in 2023 pivoted long ago to be highly environmentally conscious, something Higgins would be aware of if he interacted with economists more. Labour senator Marie Sherlock defended Higgins&#x27;s commentary while the Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe stated he welcomed the debate brought about by Higgins&#x27;s comments.

On 6 May, Higgins was at the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla, marking the first time that a President of Ireland had attended the coronation of a British monarch.

On 29 February 2024, Higgins was taken to hospital as a precaution after complaining of feeling unwell. On 24 April, Higgins confirmed he had suffered a mild stroke.

On 20 December 2024, Higgins delivered his final Christmas Message as President of Ireland, in which he called against worldwide conflict and the ensuing human rights violations, praised the Irish communities worldwide, wished well all new citizens welcomed to the country and thanked the people of Ireland for their support over his two terms as President.

On 27 January 2025, Higgins was accused by multiple Israeli Ministers and former Israeli Ambassador to Ireland Dana Erlich of &quot;politicalising&quot; a Holocaust Memorial Day Commemoration in Dublin to commemorate 80 years since the liberation of Auschwitz. One protester was removed and others left the event during Higgins&#x27;s speech, when he said &quot;Those in Israel who mourn their loved ones, those who have been waiting for the release of hostages, or the thousands searching for relatives in the rubble in Gaza will welcome the long-overdue ceasefire for which there has been such a heavy price paid.&quot; Tom O&#x27;Dowd, the chairperson of Holocaust Education Ireland (who organise the commemoration), said &quot;It turned out to be a very small protest. It didn&#x27;t stop the President in his stride. And I think it is worth pointing out that the President has spent a lifetime fighting for civil and human rights, and I don&#x27;t think he would object to people objecting either.&quot; This was the seventh occasion on which Higgins had been invited to speak at the annual commemoration.

==Other work==

Higgins has campaigned for human rights and written of conflict in many parts of the world, including such areas as Nicaragua, Chile, Cambodia, El Salvador, Iraq and Somalia. He spoke in the Dáil in defence of the 2010 Gaza Freedom Flotilla. In recognition of his work for peace with justice in many parts of the world, he became the first recipient of the Seán MacBride Peace Prize of the International Peace Bureau in Helsinki in 1992. He was a noted critic of U.S. foreign policy under the Ronald Reagan administration. In 2005, in response to a column for the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; by Kevin Myers about the riots then erupting across immigrant areas in France and Britain, he said &quot;the contents of his column today go beyond his usually crafted cowardice, staying one step on the safe side of prosecution for incitement to hatred or racism.&quot;

Higgins has voiced his support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.

Higgins&#x27;s eclectic mix of interests also extends to sport; he is a regular at the Galway Races each summer. He has also previously served as president of Galway United F.C., is a well known football supporter and regularly attends League of Ireland games. In 2014 the Football Association of Ireland introduced a new association football super cup, the President&#x27;s Cup, in his honour. On 25 February 2014, the cup itself was officially unveiled with a ceremony at Áras an Uachtaráin. Higgins subsequently attended the inaugural final at Richmond Park on 2 March 2014.

Higgins is the subject of the song &quot;Michael D. Rocking in the Dáil&quot; by popular Tuam band The Saw Doctors. The song first appeared as a B-side on the 1994 single &quot;Small Bit of Love&quot; and is also on the 2002 compilation &quot;Play It Again, Sham!&quot;.

<doc id="559759" wikidata="Q170142" url="?curid=559759" title="Martin XB-51">
<text>The Martin XB-51 was an American trijet ground-attack aircraft. It was designed in 1945 and made its maiden flight in 1949. It was originally designed as a bomber for the United States Army Air Forces under specification V-8237-1 and was designated XA-45. The &quot;A&quot; ground-attack classification was eliminated the next year, and the XB-51 designation was assigned instead. The requirement was for low-level bombing and close support. The XB-51 lost out in evaluation to the English Electric Canberra which — built by Martin — entered service as the Martin B-57 Canberra.

==Design and development==
This unorthodox design, first flying on 28 October 1949, was fitted with three General Electric J47 engines - an unusual number for a combat aircraft - two underneath the forward fuselage in pods, and one at the extreme tail with the intake at the base of the tailfin. The innovative, variable incidence wings, swept at 35° and with 6° anhedral, were equipped with leading edge slats and full-width flaps. Spoilers gave most of the roll control and undersized ailerons provided feel for the pilot. The combination of variable incidence and slotted flaps gave a shorter takeoff run. Four 954 lb (4.24 kN) thrust Rocket-Assisted Take Off (RATO) bottles with a 14-second burn duration could be fitted to the rear fuselage to improve takeoff performance. Spectacular launches were a feature of later test flights.
The main landing gear consisted of dual wheel sets in tandem in the fuselage, similar to the Boeing B-47 Stratojet, with outrigger wheels at the wingtips (originally proved on a modified Martin B-26 Marauder named &quot;Middle River Stump Jumper&quot;). The XB-51 was a large but aerodynamically &quot;clean&quot; design which incorporated nearly all major systems internally. The aircraft was fitted with a rotating bomb bay, a Martin trademark; bombs could also be carried externally up to a maximum load of 10,400 lb (4,700 kg), although the specified basic mission required only a 4,000 lb (1,814 kg) bombload. Eight 20 mm cannon mounted in the nose would have been installed in production aircraft.

Crew was a pilot under a &quot;fighter&quot;-type bubble canopy and a Short-range navigation and bombing system (SHORAN) operator/navigator in a compartment located lower than and to the rear of the cockpit (only a small observation window was provided). Both crew members were provided with a pressurized, air conditioned environment, equipped with upward-firing ejection seats. The XB-51 was the first Martin aircraft equipped with ejection seats, these being of their own design.

==Operational history==
In 1950, the United States Air Force issued a new requirement based on early Korean War experience for a night intruder/bomber to replace the Douglas A-26 Invader. The XB-51 was entered, as well as the Avro Canada CF-100 and English Electric Canberra; the XB-51 and Canberra emerged from these as the favorites.

Test flights showed the XB-51 to be highly maneuverable at low altitudes and substantially faster than the Canberra and faster than most fighter aircraft of the era. However, the XB-51&#x27;s endurance was significantly lower than that of the Canberra and this factor was decisive in its cancellation. In addition, a load limiting factor of only 3.67 &quot;g&quot; (36 m/s2) meant that the general strength of the airframe was relatively low and would prevent tight turns while fully loaded. Additionally, the tandem main gear plus outriggers of the XB-51 were thought unsuitable for the requirement to fly from emergency forward airfields.

While the XB-51 was not selected for procurement, it was decided that Martin would build 250 Canberras under license, under the designation B-57. Furthermore, Martin&#x27;s rotating bomb bay would be incorporated into production variants of the B-57. A &quot;Super Canberra&quot;, incorporating other XB-51 features, such as swept wings and tail-planes, was also proposed. This aircraft – although it promised much better speed and performance than the B-57 – never reached the prototype stage, mainly because the many changes would have taken too long to implement and test, before it could be put into production.

Flights by the XB-51 prototype, &quot;46-685&quot;, continued, for general research purposes, following the project&#x27;s official cancellation by the USAF. A second prototype, &quot;46-686&quot;, which first flew in 1950, crashed during low-level aerobatics on 9 May 1952, killing pilot Major Neil H. Lathrop. &quot;46-685&quot; continued to fly, including an appearance in the film &quot;Toward the Unknown&quot; as the &quot;Gilbert XF-120&quot; fighter. The surviving prototype was en route to Eglin AFB to shoot additional footage when it crashed during takeoff, following a refueling stop in El Paso, Texas, on 25 March 1956.

<text>Michael Joseph Hayes (1 December 1889 – 11 July 1976) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1922 to 1932, Minister for Foreign Affairs from August 1922 to September 1922 and Minister for Education January 1922 to August 1922. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the National University constituency from 1921 to 1933. He was a Senator from 1938 to 1965.

Hayes was born in Dublin in 1889. He was educated at the Synge Street CBS and at University College Dublin (UCD). He later became a lecturer in French at the university. In 1913, he joined the Irish Volunteers and fought in Jacob&#x27;s Factory during the Easter Rising in 1916. He escaped capture but was arrested in 1920 and interned at Ballykinlar, County Down.

He was first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Sinn Féin TD for the National University constituency at the 1921 general election. At the 1922 general election he was elected as a Pro-Treaty Sinn Féin TD. He supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty during the crucial debates in 1922. He served as Minister for Education from January to September 1922, as part of the Dáil Ministry (as opposed to the Provisional Government). He had special responsibility for secondary education. He was also acting Minister for Foreign Affairs from August to September 1922. That same year he was elected Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil Éireann. He held that post for ten years until 1932.

At the 1923 general election, he was elected as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD for two constituencies; Dublin South and the National University. He resigned his seat in Dublin South following the election.

Hayes lost his Dáil seat at the 1933 general election, but was elected to Seanad Éireann in 1938 for Fine Gael. He remained a Senator until 1965, acting as leader of government and opposition there.

Hayes became Professor of Irish at University College Dublin in 1951.

<doc id="559764" wikidata="Q260126" url="?curid=559764" title="Roentgen equivalent man">
<text>The roentgen equivalent man (rem) is a CGS unit of equivalent dose, effective dose, and committed dose, which are dose measures used to estimate potential health effects of low levels of ionizing radiation on the human body.

Quantities measured in rem are designed to represent the stochastic biological risk of ionizing radiation, which is primarily radiation-induced cancer. These quantities are derived from absorbed dose, which in the CGS system has the unit rad. There is no universally applicable conversion constant from rad to rem; the conversion depends on relative biological effectiveness (RBE).

The rem has been defined since 1976 as equal to 0.01 sievert, which is the more commonly used SI unit outside the United States. Earlier definitions going back to 1945 were derived from the roentgen unit, which was named after Wilhelm Röntgen, a German scientist who discovered X-rays. The unit name is misleading, since 1 roentgen actually deposits about 0.96 rem in soft biological tissue, when all weighting factors equal unity. Older units of rem following other definitions are up to 17% smaller than the modern rem.

Doses greater than 100 rem received over a short time period are likely to cause acute radiation syndrome (ARS), possibly leading to death within weeks if left untreated. Note that the quantities that are measured in rem were not designed to be correlated to ARS symptoms. The absorbed dose, measured in rad, is a better indicator of ARS.

A rem is a large dose of radiation, so the millirem (mrem), which is one thousandth of a rem, is often used for the dosages commonly encountered, such as the amount of radiation received from medical x-rays and background sources.

==Usage==
The rem and millirem are CGS units in widest use among the U.S. public, industry, and government. However, the SI unit the sievert (Sv) is the normal unit outside the United States, and is increasingly encountered within the US in academic, scientific, and engineering environments, and have now virtually replaced the rem.

The conventional units for dose rate is mrem/h. Regulatory limits and chronic doses are often given in units of mrem/yr or rem/yr, where they are understood to represent the total amount of radiation allowed (or received) over the entire year. In many occupational scenarios, the hourly dose rate might fluctuate to levels thousands of times higher for a brief period of time, without infringing on the annual total exposure limits. The annual conversions to a Julian year are:
:1 mrem/h = 8,766 mrem/yr
:0.1141 mrem/h = 1,000 mrem/yr

The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) once adopted fixed conversion for occupational exposure, although these have not appeared in recent documents:
:8 h = 1 day
:40 h = 1 week
:50 week = 1 yr
Therefore, for occupation exposures of that time period,
:1 mrem/h = 2,000 mrem/yr
:0.5 mrem/h = 1,000 mrem/yr

The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) strongly discourages Americans from expressing doses in rem, in favor of recommending the SI unit. The NIST recommends defining the rem in relation to the SI in every document where this unit is used.

== Health effects ==
Ionizing radiation has deterministic and stochastic effects on human health. The deterministic effects that can lead to acute radiation syndrome only occur in the case of high doses (&gt; ~10 rad or &gt; 0.1 Gy) and high dose rates (&gt; ~10 rad/h or &gt; 0.1 Gy/h). A model of deterministic risk would require different weighting factors (not yet established) than are used in the calculation of equivalent and effective dose. To avoid confusion, deterministic effects are normally compared to absorbed dose in units of rad, not rem.

Stochastic effects are those that occur randomly, such as radiation-induced cancer. The consensus of the nuclear industry, nuclear regulators, and governments, is that the incidence of cancers caused by ionizing radiation can be modeled as increasing linearly with effective dose at a rate of 0.055% per rem (5.5%/Sv). Individual studies, alternate models, and earlier versions of the industry consensus have produced other risk estimates scattered around this consensus model. There is general agreement that the risk is much higher for infants and fetuses than adults, higher for the middle-aged than for seniors, and higher for women than for men, though there is no quantitative consensus about this. There is much less data, and much more controversy, regarding the possibility of cardiac and teratogenic effects, and the modelling of internal dose.

The ICRP recommends limiting artificial irradiation of the public to an average of 100 mrem (1 mSv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures. For comparison, radiation levels inside the United States Capitol are 85 mrem/yr (0.85 mSv/yr), close to the regulatory limit, because of the uranium content of the granite structure. The NRC sets the annual total effective dose of full body radiation, or total body radiation (TBR), allowed for radiation workers 5,000 mrem (5 rem).

==History==
The concept of the rem first appeared in literature in 1945 and was given its first definition in 1947. The definition was refined in 1950 as &quot;that dose of any ionizing radiation which produces a relevant biological effect equal to that produced by one roentgen of high-voltage x-radiation.&quot; Using data available at the time, the rem was variously evaluated as 83, 93, or 95 erg/gram. Along with the introduction of the rad in 1953, the ICRP decided to continue the use of the rem. The US National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements noted in 1954 that this effectively implied an increase in the magnitude of the rem to match the rad (100 erg/gram). The ICRP introduced and then officially adopted the rem in 1962 as the unit of equivalent dose to measure the way different types of radiation distribute energy in tissue and began recommending values of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for various types of radiation. In practice, the unit of rem was used to denote that an RBE factor had been applied to a number which was originally in units of rad or roentgen.

The International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) adopted the sievert in 1980 but never accepted the use of the rem. The NIST recognizes that this unit is outside the SI but temporarily accepts its use in the U.S. with the SI. The rem remains in widespread use as an industry standard in the U.S. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission still permits the use of the units curie, rad, and rem alongside SI units.

<doc id="559769" wikidata="Q12741759" url="?curid=559769" title="Sutherland, New South Wales">
<text>Sutherland is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Sutherland is located 26 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative centre for the local government area of the Sutherland Shire.

==History==
There are two theories for the origin of the Sutherland name:

* It is suggested that the name was taken from able seaman Forby Sutherland, who died on Captain Cook&#x27;s &quot;Endeavour&quot; voyage. Sutherland Point at Kurnell is named after him, but there&#x27;s no direct connection of him to the Sutherland Shire district.
* Thomas Mitchell as surveyor general in 1835 named the first parish south of the Georges River as the &quot;Parish of Southerland&quot; (South with an &quot;o&quot;). But it appeared in a later government gazette spelt Sutherland, losing the significance of the name.

Thomas Holt (1811–1888) purchased 13,000 acres (53 km2) in the 1860s that stretched from Sutherland to Cronulla. The Sutherland area was originally heavily timbered and timber-cutting became the first industry. Holt initiated many commercial projects including timber cutting, coal mining, sheep farming and oyster farming. He built a forty-room mansion called Sutherland House in 1868 at Sylvania, on the bank of Gwawley Bay. The mansion was destroyed by fire in 1918, thought to have been deliberately lit.

The first road through the area was South Road constructed in 1842. Later Illawarra Road was built along the ridges of high land to the Woronora River. The Princes Highway became the main thoroughfare through Sutherland, linking Sydney to the Illawarra region.

The railway line was constructed in the 1880s and development followed. Residents lived in humpies or tents in the bush. Once the land was cleared, a township developed around the railway station. In 1886 there were only four permanent buildings: the railway station, the station master&#x27;s residence, the railway keeper&#x27;s cottage and a general store run by a man called Bramley. The post office opened on 1 September 1886 and a school began classes in 1887.
In 1906, the shire of Sutherland was proclaimed and the name Sutherland was officially declared. The first meetings were held in the shire clerk&#x27;s home and the Council Chambers were built in 1915. By the 1920s, steam trams operated between Cronulla and Sutherland.

===Woronora Memorial Park===

In 1897, land was set aside west of Sutherland station for a denominational cemetery, as an alternative to a site at Kurnell, which would have required a long branch line. A single track line long was constructed next to the station and opened on 13 June 1900. A single platform long and a loop for engines were included. The first funeral had taken place earlier that year, with the casket arriving by train from Mortuary station in the city. However, due to the advent of the motor car and motorised funerals, funerals by train eventually fell out of favour, with the result that the line closed on 23 May 1947, with no funeral having taken place for some years beforehand. The line and platform were subsequently demolished and removed; no remains, apart from the original formation coming from the main line, are visible today.

==Commercial area==
Sutherland is a mostly residential area with a shopping centre located close to Sutherland station. Some commercial developments are also located on the Princes Highway. As the administrative centre of the Sutherland Shire, Sutherland hosts facilities such as a general purpose entertainment centre where citizenship ceremonies take place, a community centre, local government council offices and Sutherland Library, a major central library. Woronora Cemetery sits on the western border of the suburb.

Stapleton&#x27;s butchery closed in 2017. It had opened in Sutherland in 1896.

==Transport==
Sutherland station is a junction on the Illawarra railway line of the Sydney Trains network. The main line runs south to Waterfall and Kiama and north to Bondi Junction, and a branch line runs east to Cronulla.

For details of bus services see Sutherland Station

When the Southern Freeway (also known as the F6) was built linking Sydney to Wollongong, the Princes Highway was diverted away from the centre of Sutherland using Acacia Road. An F6 extension has been proposed for many years, which would link Sutherland to the Captain Cook Bridge via Miranda and onto the Southern Cross Drive via Brighton-Le-Sands.

==Schools==
Local schools in the area including public, Catholic and private schools include: 
*Sutherland Public School
*Sutherland North Public School
*Minerva School
*St Patrick&#x27;s College
* St Patrick&#x27;s Primary School

==Churches==
There are 8 churches located in Sutherland which include:
*St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church
*St John the Baptist Anglican Church
*St Andrews Presbyterian Church
*Sutherland Uniting Church
*Good Shepherd Lutheran Church Sutherland 
*Christadelphian Church
*Shirelive Church (Pentecostal) 
*Sutherland Presbyterian Reformed Church

==Parks==
Prince Edward Park, Sutherland Park, Waratah Park, Peace Park, Forby Sutherland Memorial Garden, Sutherland Community Gardens, Clio Street Reserve, Glencoe Street Reserve, Gray Street Reserve, Leonay Street Reserve.

Prince Edward Park is a large park situated between the Woronora River and Sutherland. Along the river, a cleared area was created as a recreational park, with facilities for boating and fishing. It is also the location for the Sutherland Region Girl Guides canoeing facility, Woronora Scout Group and the Woronora Life Saving Club. Going towards Sutherland, the park is natural Eucalyptus bushland, with some walking trails.

==Sport and recreation==
Sutherland Leisure Centre located on Rawson Avenue features a 50-metre heated outdoor pool, an international size water polo pool and a multi-functional family fun and recreation area incorporating both a 50-metre and 25-metre indoor pool, spa and steamroom. The pool is home to the swim club SLC Aquadot The gymnasium offers fitness equipment, fitness classes, boxing/fitness circuit, martial arts room and beach volleyball court.

Since 1963 Sutherland Oval has been the home ground of the North Sutherland Rockets. The club competes in the Sutherland Shire Football Association Competition.

==Population==
According to the of Population, there were 11,570 people in Sutherland.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.6% of the population. 
* 71.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.4%, China 2.0%, New Zealand 1.5%, India 1.3% and Philippines 1.3%.
* 76.3% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 2.2%, Spanish 1.6%, Russian 1.5%, Cantonese 1.4% and Nepali 0.9%.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 37.6%, Catholic 22.5% and Anglican 13.7%.

<doc id="559776" wikidata="Q3048852" url="?curid=559776" title="E. L. M. Burns">
<text>Lieutenant General Eedson Louis Millard &quot;Tommy&quot; Burns, (June 17, 1897 – September 13, 1985) was a senior officer of the Canadian Army and a diplomat. He saw active service in both World War I and World War II. He served as the first commander of the first United Nations peacekeeping force in 1956. His military career in war has, for the most part, been criticised by some historians as showing he was &quot;simply incapable of commanding a higher formation.&quot;

==Early life and military career==
E. L. M. Burns was born on June 17, 1897, in Montreal, Quebec. His father was a militia staff officer, a member of the Corps of Guides. He served with the 17th Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Canadian Hussars (17th D.Y.R.C.H.). He had risen to the rank of signal sergeant by 1913. &quot;Tommy&quot; Burns, student # 1032 graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, in 1914. He joined the Royal Canadian Engineers, into which he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in June 1915.

Burns served in Canada until March 1916 when he went overseas with the 3rd Canadian Division Signal Company which, was composed of engineers. He fought on the Western Front with the Royal Canadian Engineers from 1916 to 1918. He became a staff officer with the 3rd Division&#x27;s 9th Brigade in March 1917, dealing with supply and personnel and saw action at the Battle of Vimy Ridge. He became a &quot;staff learner&quot; and acted as liaison officer between forward battalions and brigade headquarters. He returned to Canada in 1919 and was stationed at St. John as an engineer officer. He was wounded twice during the war and also received the Military Cross. The citation for the medal reads:

==Between the wars==
After receiving a commission in the Permanent Force as a captain on 1 April 1920, Burns attended the School of Military Engineering, Chatham, England, for eighteen months. He was an instructor at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. He returned to Halifax and served on duty during the miners&#x27; strike at Glace Bay. He worked in the Survey Department in Ottawa. In 1924, he was appointed as an instructor at RMC in field engineering. He attended the Staff College, Quetta, in British India and returned to Quebec, Canada, in 1930. In 1939, as a lieutenant colonel, he attended the Imperial Defence College in London, England.

==World War II==
During World War II Burns, promoted on 1 February 1942 to the temporary rank of brigadier, assumed command of the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade, part of the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division, which eventually went to England. Precisely fifteen months after his promotion to brigadier, he received another promotion, this time to major general, on 1 May 1943, when he became the new General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. The division had been severely mauled the year before during the disastrous Dieppe Raid.

He was not destined to lead the division into battle, however, as, throughout January 1944, there were several changes in the higher levels in command in preparation for the Allied invasion of Normandy in the spring. Lieutenant-General Ernest William Sansom, commanding II Canadian Corps, and under whose command Burns&#x27;s 2nd Division was serving, was returned to Canada and replaced by Major-General Guy Simonds, returning to England from the Italian front where he had been GOC of the 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division. Burns himself handed over command of the 2nd Division to Charles Foulkes while Burns proceeded to Italy where he succeeded Simonds in command of the 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division on 23 January 1944. Not long after his arrival his superior, Lieutenant-General Harry Crerar, the commander of I Canadian Corps and who was soon to return to England to take over the First Canadian Army, had a high opinion of Burns and, believing him to be corps commander material, wanted Burns to succeed him as GOC I Canadian Corps.

That was all in the future, however. By the time of Burns&#x27;s assumption of command, the division had been in Italy for just ten weeks. On 17 January the division&#x27;s 11th Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier George Kitching, had launched a disastrous assault over the Arieli River, which failed with heavy casualties. This aside, the division still possessed more battle experience than its new GOC, who, in this war, had never commanded even a company in battle, let alone an entire division. He therefore found himself in the same position that every Canadian divisional commander, the exceptions being Major-General John Hamilton Roberts, who had commanded the 2nd Division at Dieppe, Simonds, who before being GOC of the 5th Division had commanded the 1st Canadian Infantry Division in Sicily, along with Christopher Vokes, who succeeded Simonds in command of the 1st Division. Even Burns&#x27;s superior, Crerar, had not had the chance to command the two divisions (the 1st and 5th) serving in his corps. The lack of battle experience mattered to the men who had successfully commanded units in battle before (such as at the recent Battle of Ortona, where Vokes&#x27;s 1st Division had driven out German paratroopers, albeit at a heavy cost) and they were frustrated at an as-yet untested commander being given command of a newly arrived division. General Sir Bernard Montgomery, the former commander of the British Eighth Army (under whose control I Canadian Corps fell), placed experience in battle very highly, as did his successor in command of the Eighth Army, Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese, a man with whom Burns was to clash on several occasions over the following months.

As a result of this, Burns had a lot to prove, and he had to prove it quickly, in the eyes of both his superiors and subordinates alike. Leese, initially at least, liked what he saw of &quot;Tommy&quot; Burns, writing home to his wife in early March, &quot;I think he will be good. I will be glad to get rid of Harry [Crerar] and get Burns installed &amp; to get down to some degree of permanency.&quot; Lieutenant Colonel W. C. Murphy, the 5th Division&#x27;s GSO1, also hoped for a permanent commander who would stay longer than a few weeks. He wrote to his family in early February, &quot;General Burns has joined us. He is very nice to work with and all goes well from that angle. No doubt I&#x27;ll find a general that I consider good enough to keep on the job one of these days. I hope we&#x27;ll settle down with no more changes for a while because things always have to be adjusted a bit with each boss man&#x27;s viewpoint.&quot;

Despite Murphy&#x27;s wishes, change did arrive, as in late March, after receiving a promotion, this time to the acting rank of lieutenant-general on 20 March, Burns became GOC I Canadian Corps, taking over from Crerar, who was returning to England to take over command of the First Canadian Army. Crerar, who continued to think highly of Burns, wrote to Lieutenant-General Kenneth Stuart, the acting commander of the First Army in England as well as chief of staff at Canadian Military Headquarters (CMHQ), that, &quot;Burns is showing up very well, indeed, and gives one a feeling of great confidence. Vokes [GOC 1st Division] has certainly reached his ceiling but, providing he is told very clearly what he is to do, and is guided, in his actions, from above, can be regarded as fit for the responsibilities of his appointment.&quot; Vokes was a tough officer who had commanded the 1st Division&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Brigade throughout the fighting in Sicily and briefly in Italy but Montgomery believed that command of a division was his limit, which he probably told Crerar, who might well have been offended by Vokes&#x27;s womanizing and almost constant cursing. As a result, Burns, to his surprise, found himself promoted to corps commander instead of Vokes.

Burns&#x27;s performance as a corps-level commander proved to be controversial, despite the successes of the Canadian forces in the Italian campaign, and so he was replaced as commander of I Canadian Corps by Major-General Charles Foulkes.

Following this major setback to his career, Burns, reverting back to his permanent rank of major-general, was given another chance, and he was sent to Northwestern Europe in December 1944, becoming the Chief of Canadian Section, 1st Echelon, 21st Army Group, a position he held until September 1945, by which time the war, after six long years, had finally come to an end.

==Later life==
Burns served as Deputy Minister of Veterans’ Affairs. He served as a President of the UNAC during the 1950s. He played a critical role in the Middle East peace process from 1954 to 1959. He was instrumental in developing UN peacekeeping. As Chief of Staff in 1954, United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) was designed to maintain the General Armistice Agreements until permanent peace could be formulated.

Burns served as a Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine (1954–56) and was thus nearby when the Suez Crisis of 1956 occurred. He then led UNEF as Force Commander from November 1956 to December 1959. He was promoted to lieutenant-general.

He was Canada&#x27;s principal disarmament negotiator from 1960 to 1968. 
Burns held the chair of Strategic Studies at the Norman Paterson School for International Affairs, Carleton University from 1969 to 1975. He wrote &quot;Between Arab and Israeli&quot; (1962); &quot;General Mud: Memoirs of Two World Wars&quot; (1970) and &quot;Defense in the Nuclear Age&quot; (1976).

He died in Manotick, Ontario at the age of 88.

==Honours==
Burns was awarded the Military Cross for maintaining communications under heavy fire, and, for the same action at the Somme, his non-commissioned officers received Military Medals.

In 1967 Burns was made a Companion of the Order of Canada for his services to Canada at home and abroad. He was described as a Former Chief of General Staff and Canadian adviser on disarmament in Geneva. In 1970, he received an honorary doctorate from Sir George Williams University, which later became Concordia University.

Burns was the 1981 recipient of the Pearson Medal of Peace for his work in the military of Canada. He is a 2010 induction to the Wall of Honour at the Royal Military College of Canada. There is also a park located in Nepean named after him.

A mannequin at the Royal Military College of Canada wears &quot;Tommy&quot; Burns&#x27;s khaki army uniform jacket, covered with medals and wrapped with a Sam Browne belt.

The largest building at the Canadian Forces College is named Burns Hall, and his portrait is displayed at the entrance of the college.

<text>The Rocks is a suburb, tourist precinct, and historic area of Sydney&#x27;s city centre. It is on the southern shore of Sydney Harbour, immediately north-west of the Sydney&#x27;s CBD.

==Boundaries==
The formal boundaries of the suburb named The Rocks cover the western side of Sydney Cove east of the Sydney Harbour Bridge approaches. In the north it extends to the southern base of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, in the east to the shoreline of Circular Quay and George Street, in the south to Jamison Street (thus including the area known as Church Hill), and in the west to southern approaches of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Western Distributor overpass.

==History==
The Rocks was established shortly after the colony&#x27;s formation in 1788. It was known as Tallawoladah by the Cadigal people. The original buildings were first traditional vernacular houses, of wattle and daub, with thatched roofs, and later of local sandstone, from which the area derives its name. From the earliest history of the settlement, the area had a reputation as a slum and the arriving convicts&#x27; side of town, often frequented by visiting sailors and prostitutes. After November 1790, many of the inhabitants were also Aboriginal. In 1823, the district had a population of about 1,200. During the late nineteenth century, the area was dominated by a gang known as the Rocks Push. It maintained this rough reputation until approximately the 1870s.

By the early 20th century many of the area&#x27;s historic buildings were in serious decay. In 1900, bubonic plague broke out, and the state government resumed areas around The Rocks and Darling Harbour, with the intention of demolishing them and rebuilding them. More than 3,800 houses, buildings and wharves were inspected and hundreds demolished, but the continuation of these plans were brought to a halt due to the outbreak of World War I. During the 1920s, several hundred buildings were demolished during the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, with the intention of demolishing most of the original buildings, re-developing them as high-density residential dwellings. In February 1971 a group of local residents formed the Rocks Residents Group to oppose the plans. They felt that the new dwellings would result in increased rents, which would force out the traditional residents of the area. The residents&#x27; group requested a green ban from the Builder&#x27;s Labourers Federation, who had become increasingly active in preventing controversial developments over the previous four years.
By 1973 the union had imposed the ban, and after discussions with the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, a &#x27;People&#x27;s Plan&#x27; was developed. By October 1973, it appeared that the redevelopment would proceed as originally planned, using non-union labour. For two weeks, demonstrations by local residents and unionists followed, with numerous arrests being made. Liberal Premier Robert Askin was in the midst of an election campaign, and used the protests as a means of conveying his law and order message to voters. However, the green ban stayed in place until 1975 when the state union leadership was overthrown and was ultimately successful, as can be seen in the buildings that survive today. Instead of demolishing The Rocks, renovations transformed the area into a commercial and tourist precinct.

Today the Rocks is a partly gentrified area, but still contains a significant proportion of Housing Commission properties, and there is still a significant problem of urban poverty and street crime in this district. As housing stock becomes dilapidated, government policy is to sell the now extremely valuable public housing units to private owners, in the expectation that they will restore the properties. The Sirius Building and the associated &quot;Save Our Sirius&quot; protest group was formed to protest relocation of its residents. Overall, The Rocks continues to be an important part of Sydney&#x27;s cultural landscape, offering a fascinating glimpse into the city&#x27;s rich history and vibrant contemporary scene.

== Church Hill ==

&quot;Church Hill&quot; is located in the southern part of The Rocks, sometimes identified as the northern part of the Sydney central business district. It is so named because the earliest churches in Australia were formed on this site, including St Patrick&#x27;s (Roman Catholic), St Philip&#x27;s (Anglican) and Scots Church (Presbyterian)

The significance of Church Hill dates back to the time of Governor Arthur Phillip, who mandated compulsory Sunday church attendance for all convicts, until they rebelled and burned down the area&#x27;s first church in 1798.

The area gained greater prominence as Church Hill on Wednesday 1 October 1800, when incoming Governor Philip Gidley King had the foundation stone laid for St Philip&#x27;s Church, which subsequently he proclaimed one of Australia&#x27;s first two parishes in 1802 (the other being St John&#x27;s in Parramatta).

The site where St Patrick&#x27;s Church currently stands is where the Roman Catholic Eucharist was first preserved in Australia, in May 1818. Celebrations for the bicentenary of this occasion were held in St Patrick&#x27;s Church on Sunday 6 May 2018.

<text>The Tuileries Palace (, ) was a royal and imperial palace in Paris which stood on the right bank of the Seine, directly in the west-front of the Louvre Palace. It was the Parisian residence of most French monarchs, from Henry IV to Napoleon III, until it was burned by the Paris Commune in 1871.

Construction began in 1564, originally to serve as a home for Queen Catherine de&#x27; Medici, and it was gradually extended until it closed off the western end of the Louvre courtyard and displayed an immense façade of 266 metres. Since the destruction of the Tuileries, the Louvre courtyard has remained open to the west, and the site now overlooks the eastern end of the Tuileries Garden, forming an elevated terrace between the Place du Carrousel and the gardens proper.

==History==
===Plan of Catherine de&#x27; Medici (16th century) ===
The site of the Tuileries Palace was originally just outside the walls of the city, in an area frequently flooded by the Seine as far as the present Rue Saint-Honoré. The land was occupied by the workshops and kilns craftsmen who made &quot;tuiles&quot;, or roof tiles. Because of its proximity to the Louvre Castle, members of the royal family began buying plots of land there.

After the death of Henry II in 1559, his widow Catherine de&#x27; Medici moved into the Louvre Castle with her son, Francis II. She planned a new residence for herself, on a site that was close to the Louvre and had space for a large garden. She sold the medieval Hôtel des Tournelles, near the Bastille, where her husband had died, and between 1563 and 1568 acquired several pieces of land which she put together for her new residence. Construction began in 1564, with Philibert de l&#x27;Orme working as chief architect. De l&#x27;Orme died in 1570, when the work was still in its early stages. His place was taken by Jean Bullant. The 1588 outbreak of conflict between Protestants and Catholics in the city abruptly halted the work, and the unprotected site was abandoned and pillaged.

===Additions of Henry IV===
Work did not resume until 1594, when Henry IV made a triumphal return to Paris, and recommenced construction of the Louvre and the Tuileries. He constructed the Grande Galerie, parallel to the Seine, which connected the two palaces. At the same time, Henry commissioned the landscape gardener Claude Mollet to modify the plan of the gardens. The architects and decorators Etienne Duperac, Louis Metezeau and Jacques II Androuet du Cerceau contributed to the new palace. Androuet de Cerceau contributed the Gros Pavilion des Tuileries, a tower that linked the Louvre and Tuileries palaces.

===Louis XIV and Louis XV – enlargement and departure (17th and 18th centuries) ===
After the death of Henry IV in 1610, work on the palace halted. His son Louis XIII had no intention of continuing construction. Indeed, work did not resume until after the end of the Fronde rebellion in 1653. Between 1659 and 1661, King Louis XIV and Cardinal Mazarin had First Royal Architect Louis Le Vau enlarge the palace, extending it to the north with the addition of the Théâtre des Tuileries.

In 1662, Louis XIV celebrated the birth of his son and heir, Louis, Dauphin of France, with a spectacular &quot;Carrousel&quot; held in the courtyard on the east side of the palace. The equestrian pageant, with dressage and other exercises, drew over 700 participants. It offered a variety of tournaments and competitions, including a contest in which horsemen were asked to spear the cardboard heads of &quot;Saracens&quot; and &quot;Moors&quot;, as well as a series of mounted processions around the courtyard, complete with music. The King himself took part, dressed as a Roman emperor. The courtyard thereafter became known as the Carrousel.

From 1664 to 1666, Le Vau and his assistant François d&#x27;Orbay made other significant changes. They transformed Philibert de l&#x27;Orme&#x27;s façades and central pavilion, replacing its grand central staircase with a colonnaded vestibule on the ground floor and the Salle des Cents Suisses (Hall of the Hundred Swiss Guards) on the floor above. They also added a rectangular dome. A new grand staircase was installed in the entrance of the north wing of the palace, and lavishly decorated royal apartments were constructed in the south wing. The king&#x27;s rooms were on the ground floor, facing the Louvre, and the queen&#x27;s on the floor above, overlooking the garden. At the same time, Louis&#x27; gardener, André Le Nôtre, redesigned the Tuileries Garden.

Louis XIV fully used his redecorated and enlarged palace for only a short time. The Court moved into the Tuileries Palace in November 1667, but left in 1672, and soon thereafter settled in the Palace of Versailles. The Tuileries Palace was virtually abandoned and used only as a theatre, but its gardens became a fashionable resort of Parisians.

Following the death of Louis XIV in December 1715, his great-grandson, Louis XV, just five years old, was moved from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace on 1 January 1716. The palace had been rarely used in forty years; it was refurnished and redecorated for the new king, but he remained only until 15 June 1722, when he moved to Versailles, three months before his coronation. Both moves were made at the behest of the Regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The King also resided at the Tuileries for short periods during the 1740s. The large palace theatre continued to be used as a venue for operas, concerts and performances of the Comédie-Française.

=== Louis XVI – Royal sanctuary and revolutionary battleground ===
On 1 December 1783, the palace garden was the starting point of a major event in aviation history—the first manned flight in a hydrogen balloon, by Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers. It took place just two months after the first manned balloon flight by the Montgolfier brothers in a hot air balloon from the Palace of Versailles. King Louis XVI watched from the tower. Among the crowd of spectators was Benjamin Franklin, the United States ambassador to France. The balloon and its passengers landed safely at Nesles-la-Vallée, 31 miles from Paris.

Not long afterwards, on 6 October 1789, Louis XVI and his family were forced to leave Versailles for Paris, moving back into the Tuileries. Nothing had been prepared for their arrival; the various occupants who had moved into the palace were abruptly expelled, and furniture had to be brought from Versailles. The royal family lived in relative calm for a time; the gardens were reserved for them until noon when they were opened to the public.

On 9 November 1789, the National Constituent Assembly, formerly the Estates General of 1789, moved its meetings from the tennis court at Versailles to the Salle du Manège. This was the Tuileries&#x27; covered equestrian academy, on the north side of the palace, which was the largest meeting hall in the city. It was also used by the Assembly&#x27;s successor, the National Convention and, in 1795, the Council of Five Hundred (&quot;Conseil des Cinq-Cents&quot;) of the Directory until the body moved to the Palais-Bourbon in 1798. In 1799, the Jacobin Club du Manège had its headquarters there. The Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, met in the Pavillon de Flore.

On 21 June 1791, as the Revolution intensified, the King and his family attempted to escape. That night they attended a final Vespers Mass in the palace chapel, and then, disguised and with their attendants, attempted to reach the Austrian border by coach. They were recognised and arrested at Varennes, brought back to Paris, and placed under house arrest.

On 10 August 1792, a large mob stormed the palace gates, entered the gardens, and overwhelmed and massacred the Swiss Guards who defended the palace. They set fires in several of the outlying buildings of the palace. Vestiges of buildings destroyed by the fires were discovered during archaeological excavations in 1989. After the massacre of the Swiss Guards, the palace itself was taken over by the Sans-culottes. In November 1792, the invaders discovered the armoire de fer, a hiding place at the royal apartments, believed to contain the secret correspondence of Louis XVI with other European monarchs, appealing for help. This increased anger against the imprisoned king and queen. The National Convention, meeting in the Manège of the palace, launched the Reign of Terror in 1793–94, leading to the execution of the king and queen, along with thousands of others accused of opposing the Revolution.

===Napoleon in the Tuileries ===
On 19 February 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte moved his official residence to the Tuileries, a more suitable setting for his imperial ambitions. Charles Percier and Pierre Fontaine began redesigning the interior in the Neoclassical Empire style. Napoleon also began a series of reconstructions around the palace, tearing down the ruins of buildings burned during the Revolution. In 1806, in the centre of the courtyard of the Carrousel, he ordered the construction of a triumphal arch modelled after the ancient Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome to serve as the ceremonial gateway of the palace. In 1808, after he became emperor, he moved forward with the grand project of Henry IV. This project entailed the construction of a new wing of the palace on the north side of the gardens, which would match the existing wing on the south side. This wing would connect the Tuileries with the Louvre. This involved tearing down the Manège and other buildings to clear the courtyard, and the construction of a new street, the Rue de Rivoli, named for his victory at the Battle of Rivoli in 1797.

After Napoleon&#x27;s divorce, Pierre Paul Prud&#x27;hon was commissioned to design the apartments of his new wife, Marie Louise. Her bridal suite was furnished with furniture and interior decorations in the Greek Revival style. The son of Napoleon and Marie-Louise, Napoleon II, was born in 1811. He was given a residence in the Waterside Gallery of the Louvre, connected to the Tuileries by a short underground passageway, and his own small pavilion in the courtyard, decorated by Fontaine.

===Palace of Louis Philippe and Louis Napoleon ===
Following the defeat and exile of Napoleon, the gardens became a large camp for Russian and Prussian soldiers, while the kings of France returned to the palace during the Bourbon Restoration. During the July Revolution of 1830, which installed Louis Philippe I as the new monarch, the Tuileries was again stormed and occupied by an armed mob. This time the Swiss Guards of the King, rather than remaining to be massacred, quietly departed their posts. Louis Philippe occupied the palace until 1848, when it was again briefly invaded, and the King chased out during the French revolution of 1848.

Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, the nephew of Napoleon, was elected as the first President of France in 1848, and occupied the Elysée Palace. In 1852, when he could not run again, he crowned himself emperor and moved his residence to the Tuileries. The Tuileries was extensively refurbished and redecorated after the looting and damage that had occurred during the Revolution of 1848. Imposing staterooms were designed and richly decorated in what became known as the Second Empire style. The prominent roof lines of the palace, and especially its squared central dome, became influential prototypes; they were adopted for hotels and commercial buildings, as well as government buildings and residences in France and abroad. The new staterooms were theatrical settings for the ceremonies and pageantry of the Second Empire, such as the visit of Queen Victoria in 1855. The old buildings that had filled the courtyard were cleared away; and Napoleon III completed the northern wing of the Louvre along the rue de Rivoli, linking the Tuileries Palace with the Louvre, completing the grand plan of Henry IV.

The private apartment used by Napoleon III, on the ground floor of the palace&#x27;s southern wing, consisted of &quot;gilt boxes furnished in the style of the First Empire.&quot; His rooms were known to be kept at extremely high temperatures, per his request. Empress Eugénie had her apartment, comprising 8 of the 11 rooms on the bel etage of the southern wing&#x27;s garden side, above, connected to the Emperor&#x27;s by a winding staircase. Along this staircase was a mezzanine occupied by the treasurer of the privy purse.

The state rooms of the south wing—located on the side facing east to the Carrousel—were used variously, depending on the occasion. At informal dinners, the household would gather in the private drawing room, or Salon d&#x27;Apollon, which was separated from the Salle de Maréchaux, in the central pavilion, by the First Consul&#x27;s Room, or Salon Blanc. The party would proceed through the throne room to dinner in the Salon Louis XIV. However, gala dinners were held in the larger Galerie de Diane, the southernmost of the state apartments. If it were a state ball, then refreshments would be set up in the Galerie; and the procession of the imperial party would be from there to the Salle de Maréchaux, which occupied the space of two entire floors of the central Pavillon de L&#x27;Horloge and served as the ballroom.

The little-used northern wing of the palace, which contained the chapel, the Galerie de la Paix, and the Salle de Spectacle, was used only for performances, such as the Daniel Auber cantata performed on the evening of Napoleon and Eugénie&#x27;s civil wedding ceremony, 29 July 1853, or for important fêtes, such as the party given for sovereigns attending the International Exposition on 10 June 1867. The Salle de Spectacle was also used as a hospital during the Franco-Prussian War.

Between 1864 and 1868, Napoleon III asked that the Pavillon de Flore, now the southernmost pavilion, be redesigned by Hector Lefuel to match his other modifications to the palaces. It served as the backstairs to the palace, served by a network of service corridors. From the Pavillon de Flore, one could access the sprawling basement, lit with innumerable gas lamps, where a railway had been set up to bring food from the kitchens under the Rue de Rivoli.

== Destruction during the Paris Commune ==
On 23 May 1871, during the suppression of the Paris Commune, 12 men under the orders of the Commune&#x27;s former chief military commander Jules Bergeret set the Tuileries on fire using petroleum, liquid tar and turpentine. The fire lasted 48 hours and thoroughly gutted the palace, with the exception of the foundations, the Pavillon de Flore and the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel. The dome itself was blown up by explosives placed in the central pavilion and detonated by the fires. In his note to the Committee of Public Safety, Bergeret said, &quot;The last vestiges of Royalty have just disappeared. I wish that the same may befall all the public buildings of Paris.&quot; It was not until 25 May that the Paris fire brigades and the 26th battalion of the Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique managed to put out the fire. The library and other portions of the Louvre were also set on fire by Communards and entirely destroyed. The museum itself was saved by the efforts of the firemen.

The ruins of the Tuileries stood on the site for 11 years. Although the roofs and the inside of the palace had been utterly destroyed by the fire, the stone walls of the palace remained intact and restoration was possible. Other monuments of Paris also set on fire by Communards, such as the City Hall, were rebuilt in the 1870s. After much hesitation, the Third Republic, more sympathetic to the Commune, pardoned the Commune members exiled abroad. In 1882, despite opposition from Baron Haussmann and historians, they had the walls torn down.

The demolition was started in February 1883 and completed on 30 September 1883. Bits of stone and marble from the palace were sold by a private entrepreneur, Achille Picart, as souvenirs, and even to build a castle in Corsica, near Ajaccio, the , which is essentially a reconstruction of the Pavillon de Bullant. The courtyard pediment of the central pavilion can be seen in Paris&#x27; , other pieces are found in the garden of the Palais du Trocadéro, the Louvre and the Museum of Decorative Arts. In addition, other parts of the palace are located within France in Arcueil, Barentin, in Courbevoie, Château de Varax in Marcilly-d&#x27;Azergues, Nantes, Saint-Raphaël and Salins, and other countries such as Schwanenwerder in Berlin, Germany, Bordighera in Italy and Palacio de Carondelet in Quito, Ecuador.

==The Tuileries Garden and the &quot;Axe historique&quot;==
===Tuileries Garden===

The Tuileries Garden () covers ; is surrounded by the Louvre (to the east), the Seine (to the south), the Place de la Concorde (to the west) and the Rue de Rivoli (to the north); and still closely follows the design laid out by the royal landscape architect André Le Nôtre in 1664. The Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume is a museum of contemporary art located in the northwest corner of the garden.

Originally designed in 1564 as an Italian Renaissance garden by Bernard de Carnesse, the Tuileries Garden was redesigned in 1664 by Le Nôtre as a &quot;jardin à la française&quot;, which emphasized symmetry, order, and long perspectives. His formal garden plan drew out the perspective from the reflecting pools one to the other in an unbroken vista along a central axis from the west palace façade, which has been extended as the &quot;Axe historique&quot;.

===The &quot;Axe historique&quot;===
This straight line which runs through the Place de la Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe to La Défense was originally centred on the façade of the Tuileries, a similar line leading across the entrance court of the Louvre. As the two façades were placed at slightly differing angles, this resulted in a slight &#x27;kink&#x27; on the site of the palace, a feature ultimately dictated by the curved course of the River Seine.

After the palace was demolished in 1883, the large empty space between the northern and southern wings of the Louvre, now familiar to modern visitors, was revealed, and for the first time the Louvre courtyard opened onto the unbroken &quot;Axe historique&quot;.

==Proposed reconstruction==
In 2003, a group called the Committee for the Reconstruction of the Tuileries () proposed the reconstruction of the Tuileries on its original site.
Proponents of the plan noted that much of the original furniture and paintings still existed, put into storage when the Franco-Prussian War began in 1870.

In 2006 a rebuilding of the Palace of the Tuileries was estimated to cost 300 million euros (£200 million pounds sterling or US$380 million). The plan was to finance the project by public subscription with the work being undertaken by a private foundation, with the French government spending no money on the project. The French president at that time, Jacques Chirac, called for a debate on the subject. Former president Charles de Gaulle had also supported reconstruction, saying that it would &quot;make a jewel of the centre of Paris.&quot;

However, in 2008, Michel Clément, Director of Architecture and Heritage, stated &quot;From our point of view, the reconstruction of the Tuileries Palace is not a priority. In addition, it is not part of French heritage culture to resurrect monuments out of the ground &quot;ex nihilo&quot;. Rather, we are concerned with the vestiges that have survived.&quot;

<text>Lunalilo (William Charles Lunalilo; January 31, 1835 – February 3, 1874) was the sixth monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii from his election on January 8, 1873, until his death a year later. 

Born to Kekāuluohi and High Chief Charles Kanaʻina, he was of royal descent and a grandnephew of King Kamehameha I. He was educated at the Royal School by American missionaries and was proclaimed eligible for the throne by King Kamehameha III. After the death of King Kamehameha V, he was elected to the throne in 1873 by a unanimous decision of the legislature of the kingdom. Due to his popularity and status as Hawaii&#x27;s first elected monarch, he became known as &quot;The People&#x27;s King&quot;. He died a year later from tuberculosis.

==Early life==

William Charles Lunalilo was born on January 31, 1835, in a two-story house made of coral brick, an area known as &quot;Pohukaina&quot;, now part the grounds of the ʻIolani Palace in Honolulu. His mother was High Chiefess Miriam Auhea Kekāuluohi (later styled as Kaʻahumanu III) and his father was High Chief Charles Kanaʻina. He was grandnephew of Kamehameha I by blood and the monarch&#x27;s stepson by marriage to his mother. His grandmother was Kalākua Kaheiheimālie, sister of Kamehameha&#x27;s favorite wife, Queen Kaʻahumanu. This made him both, a second cousin as well as first cousin to King Kamehameha V, King Kamehameha IV, and Princess Victoria Kamāmalu through their mothers: Kekāuluohi and Kīnaʻu (later styled as Kaʻahumanu II) who were half-sisters. &quot;Lunalilo&quot; translates as &quot;Luna&quot; (high) &quot;lilo&quot; (lost) or &quot;so high up as to be lost to sight&quot; in the Hawaiian language. He was also named after King William IV of the United Kingdom, a great friend of the Hawaiian royal family.

In the 2000 publication; &quot;Kamehameha&#x27;s Children Today&quot;, authors Charles Ahlo, Rubellite Kawena Kinney Johnson and Jerry Walker state that Lunalilo&#x27;s father, Charles Kanaʻina was the great-great grandson of Kamehameha I. Kanaʻina&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Palila Nohomualani was Kamehameha I&#x27;s grandson through the monarch&#x27;s first born child named Kahiliʻōpua, daughter of Kalola-a-Kumukoa, also known as Kalolawahilani. This genealogy is based on previously unpublished family trees compiled by the DeFries family.

He was declared eligible to succeed by the royal decree of King Kamehameha III and sent to the Chief&#x27;s Children&#x27;s School (later called the Royal School) when it was founded by missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and Juliette Montague Cooke. Learning to speak both Hawaiian and English, he gained a mastery of English literature and love of Shakespearian soliloquies. According to one of his cousins, Elizabeth Kekaaniau, Lunalilo was groomed to one day assume the Governorship of Oahu after Kekūanaōʻa&#x27;s death.

Before the Great Mahele Lunalilo&#x27;s holdings of 239 &quot;ʻāina&quot; were second only to Kamehameha III. As a result of the Mahele, he relinquished 73 percent of his land. As of 1848, at the age of thirteen, he was still one of the largest landowners after the King, inheriting the land and personal property given to his mother father and grandmother by Kamehameha I. In 1850 Lunalilo gave up another large amount of land to the government reducing his holdings to 43 lots.

Affectionately known as &quot;Prince Bill,&quot; he was one of the royals (besides Kalākaua and Liliʻuokalani) to write music. He composed Hawaii&#x27;s first national anthem, &quot;E Ola Ke Aliʻi Ke Akua,&quot; which was Hawaii&#x27;s version of &quot;God Save The King&quot;.
He wrote the song in fifteen minutes in a contest hosted by newspaper publisher Henry Whitney in 1862 for the birthday of Kamehameha IV. He won the contest and was awarded ten dollars.

Lunalilo served on the Privy Council of State, the advisory council for the monarch, from 1863 to 1865, during the reign of his cousin King Kamehameha V. He also served on the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature, traditionally reserved for the high chiefs, from 1863 to 1872.

==Prospective royal brides==

He was betrothed to his cousin Princess Victoria Kamāmalu, a popular choice among the Hawaiian people except for Victoria&#x27;s brothers. They both refused to have her marry him. Their children would outrank the House of Kamehameha in family rank (&quot;mana&quot;). There were two failed attempts of marriage between the two. Lunalilo composed the Hawaiian song &quot;ʻAlekoki&quot; for his unrequited love. After Victoria, he briefly courted the hand of Liliʻuokalani, but she broke off the engagement on the advice of Kamehameha IV. Liliʻuokalani would eventually marry American John Owen Dominis and Victoria Kamāmalu would die unmarried and childless at the age of 27 in 1866. Another alleged prospective bride was a maternal cousin Miriam Auhea Kekāuluohi Crowningburg, who married a German-American settler instead.

During his reign as king, it was proposed that he marry Queen Emma, the widow of Kamehameha IV, but this proposal came to nothing due to Queen Emma&#x27;s devotion to her late husband. They remained friends and it was said he considered naming her as his heir before he died. According to Emma&#x27;s cousin Peter Kaʻeo, there were gossips that the King would marry a Tahitian chiefess from Bora Bora. Although never marrying, the king took Eliza Meek (1832–1888), the &quot;hapa-haole&quot; daughter of Captain John Meek, the harbor pilot of Honolulu, and sister-in-law of his chamberlain Horace Crabbe, as his mistress.

==Election==

King Kamehameha V, the last of the Kamehameha kings, died on December 11, 1872, without naming a successor. Under the Kingdom&#x27;s 1864 constitution, if the king did not appoint a successor, a new king would be elected by the legislature from the eligible Hawaiian royals still alive. The other candidate was David Kalākaua. Lunalilo was the more popular of the two. His grandfather was Kalaimamahu, a half brother of Kamehameha I and was thus a cousin of King Kamehameha V. His grandmother was Queen Kalakua Kaheiheimalie, sister of Queen Kaʻahumanu. Because of this, many people believed the throne rightly belonged to Lunalilo since the only person more closely related to Kamehameha V, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, made clear she did not want the throne. Another contender was Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani who was a half sister to King Kamehameha V. She was a favorite among the Hawaiian chiefs because of her adhering to the old Hawaiian ways. She was governess of Hawaii and refused to speak English even though she was fluent in it. Her genealogy, however, was too controversial and few people considered her suitable to take the throne. This left Kalākaua and Lunalilo, and of the two, Lunalilo was greatly favored. So great was Lunalilo&#x27;s popularity that some people believed that Lunalilo could have simply walked into the capital and declared himself king. Lunalilo, however, insisted that the constitution be followed. He issued the following message six days after the death of Kamehameha V:

&quot;Whereas, it is desirable that the wishes of the Hawaiian people be consulted as to a successor to the Throne, therefore, notwithstanding that according to the law of inheritance, I am the rightful heir to the Throne, in order to preserve peace, harmony and good order, I desire to submit the decision of my claim to the voice of the people.&quot;

Lunalilo, unlike his more conservative opponent, wanted to amend the constitution to make the government more democratic by removing property qualifications for voting. It was decided that there would be a popular election to give the people a chance to have their voices heard. However, because the constitution gave the legislature the power to decide who would be the next king, the popular election would be unofficial. Lunalilo urged the people of the Kingdom to have their voices heard.

The popular vote was held on January 1, 1873, and Lunalilo won by an overwhelming majority. The week after, the legislature unanimously voted Lunalilo king. It has been speculated that the reason for the unanimous vote was because each legislator was required to sign his name on the back of his ballot, and the legislators were afraid to go against the wishes of the people. Queen Emma later wrote in a letter that hundreds of Hawaiians were ready to tear to pieces anyone who opposed Lunalilo.

At Lunalilo&#x27;s investiture ceremony, held on January 9, 1873, at Kawaiahaʻo Church, the courtyard was filled to capacity and a large crowd watched from outside. Because Lunalilo&#x27;s popularity was so great, and because he became king through a democratic process, he became known as &quot;The People&#x27;s King.&quot;

==Reign as King==

When Lunalilo assumed the duties of the king, a huge change in the government&#x27;s policy began to form. His predecessor, Kamehameha V, had spent his reign increasing the powers of his office and trying to restore the absolute monarchy of his grandfather, Kamehameha I. Lunalilo, however, spent his reign trying to make the Hawaiian government more democratic. He started by writing to the legislature, recommending that the constitution be amended. He wanted to undo some changes that his predecessor had made when he enacted the 1864 Constitution.

For example, the Kingdom legislature prior to 1864 met in two houses: The House of Nobles and the House of Representatives. The members of the House of Nobles were appointed by the King and the Representatives were elected by popular vote. Lunalilo served in the House of Nobles from 1863 through 1872. Under King Kamehameha V, the two houses of legislature were combined into one. Lunalilo wished to restore the bicameral legislature. He also wanted to add a provision to the constitution that required the king to include a written explanation to accompany any veto by the king. He wanted cabinet ministers to be heard in the House of Representatives.

The King also wanted to improve Hawaii&#x27;s economic situation. The Kingdom was in an economic depression, with the whaling industry rapidly declining. Commerce groups asked the king to look at sugar to improve the economy and recommended that a treaty be drawn with the United States to allow Hawaiian sugar to enter the nation tax-free. To make such a treaty, many thought that the Kingdom would have to offer the Pearl Harbor area to the United States in exchange. There was much controversy over this, with both the public and in the legislature. When Lunalilo saw this opposition, he dropped the proposal.

During Lunalilo&#x27;s reign, a mutiny took place in the small Hawaiian army. Some members of the army revolted against the drillmaster and the adjutant general. The king interviewed the troops involved in the mutiny and he persuaded them to lay down their arms. Following this, the king disbanded the army apart from the military band. From that point on, the Kingdom had no armed forces until King Kalākaua restored them.

==Illness and death==
King Lunalilo had some bad health habits; for example, he was an alcoholic. Around August 1873, Lunalilo contracted a severe cold which developed into pulmonary tuberculosis. In hopes of regaining his health, he moved to Kailua-Kona. A few months later, on February 3, 1874, he died from tuberculosis at the age of 39, at Haimoeipo, his private residence in Honolulu. Lunalilo had reigned for one year and twenty-five days.
On his deathbed, he requested a burial at Kawaiahaʻo Church on the church&#x27;s ground. He wanted, he said, to be &quot;entombed among (my) people, rather than the kings and chiefs&quot; at the Royal Mausoleum in Nuʻuanu Valley. This was due to a feud between Lunalilo and the Kamehameha family over his mother Kekāuluohi&#x27;s exclusion from the list of royalty to be buried there. Thus, on November 23, 1875, his remains were taken from the Mausoleum, where it had rested temporarily awaiting the completion of the Lunalilo Mausoleum, to the completed tomb on the grounds of Kawaiahaʻo Church. His father requested a second funeral and a 21-gun salute from Kalākaua like during his first funeral. Kalākaua granted the second funeral but refused to allow the 21-gun salute. During this procession, eyewitness reports stated that a sudden storm arose, and that twenty-one rapid thunderclaps echoed across Honolulu which came to be known as the &quot;21-gun salute.&quot;

Like his predecessor, Lunalilo did not designate an heir to the throne. It was said he had intended for Queen Emma to succeed him, but died before a formal proclamation could be made. The most prevalent explanation of this delay is regarding his democratic principles: he wished to have the people choose their next ruler. However, the constitution of 1864 had charged the legislature, not the people, with the task of electing the next king. In the end, Kalākaua of the House of Kalākaua was voted to succeed Lunalilo as king. The election provoked the Honolulu Courthouse riots in which supporters of Queen Emma targeted legislators who supported Kalākaua; thirteen legislators were injured, with J. W. Lonoaea the only one to die from his injuries.

==Legacy==
In his will, Lunalilo set aside lands for the establishment of the Lunalilo Home, the first charitable trust established by a Hawaiian aliʻi trust, to house the poor, destitute, and infirmed people of Hawaiian descent, with preference given to older people.

<doc id="559796" wikidata="Q1369497" url="?curid=559796" title="Paul-Émile Léger">
<text>Paul-Émile Léger (April 26, 1904 – November 13, 1991) was a Canadian cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Montreal from 1950 to 1967, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1953 by Pope Pius XII.

== Early life and education ==
Paul-Émile Léger was born April 26, 1904, in Salaberry-de-Valleyfield, Quebec to Ernest Léger, a general merchant, and Alda Beauvais. He grew up in Saint-Anicet, where he served as an altar boy with his brother, Jules, and attended elementary school. He studied at Petit Séminaire de Sainte-Thérèse from 1916 to 1925, which was interrupted due to illness for almost four years beginning in January 1920. From 1925 to 1929 he studied theology at the Grand Séminaire de Montréal. Léger entered the Jesuit novitiate at Sault-au-Récollet, but was regarded as too emotional to continue in that order. Léger was transferred to the Valleyfield diocese after becoming ordained as a priest on May 25, 1929.

Léger&#x27;s first assignment was as a priest in the parish of Notre-Dame in Montreal. After joining the Society of Saint-Sulpice in September 1929 he was sent to its noviciate in Issy-les-Moulineaux for his period of solitude in 1929–1930. He then spent a year at the Institut Catholique de Paris studying canon law. Léger then taught this for a year after earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1931. He then become assistant master at the noviciate the following year.

== Japan mission ==
Léger returned to Canada to visit his parents in 1933. Later that year he left Montreal for Fukuoka, Japan, to set up a grand séminaire for educating indigenous clergy. Léger rapidly became established as a preacher and spent his first year mastering Japanese. After ten months of being in Japan, he became curé of the cathedral in Tokyo. He left that post, drained, in August 1935. The goal of the mission remained the same, but Léger faced a number of major obstacles. Although the diocese was founded in 1927 and had less than 10,000 Catholics, nothing was organized. He returned to Canada from December 1935 to October 1936 to advertise his missionary work. He remained in Japan until the beginning of World War II.

== Appointments and posts ==
He was professor of sociology in Montreal and professor of apologetics at the Pius XI Institute from 1939 to 1940.

In 1940 Léger became the vicar general of the Diocese of Valleyfield, and the parish priest at St. Cecilia Cathedral. He had to temporarily leave the Society of Saint-Sulpice. He held these posts until 1947 when he was named rector of the Canadian Pontifical College in Rome. He was affectionately received by Pope Pius XII due to the aid Gold Cross, a Quebec charity Léger founded, was providing to Rome after the war.

Léger was appointed archbishop of Montreal on March 25, 1950 by Pope Pius XII, and was raised to the rank of Monsignor on September 29, 1942. He was appointed a cardinal on November 29, 1952, one of the youngest in recent history. On January 12, 1953, he was given the honor of wearing the red hat, the first in Montreal. In this capacity he would perform the duties of the papal legate in Lourdes, France (1954), at St Joseph&#x27;s Oratory in Montreal (1955), and in Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré (1958). Léger was named a member of the Central Preparatory Commission on June 15, 1960.

== Later career ==
Léger put emphasis on the importance of love over procreation. He was also concerned with fathers being responsible. His most compelling speeches are collected in &quot;Trente textes du cardinal Léger qui ont marqué l&#x27;Église au concile et au Québec&quot;. Léger argued for more freedom of opinion. His views aligned with Pope John XXIII, who advocated for aggiornamento. His work on the Central Preparatory Commission led to close affiliations with other cardinals leading edge of modernization in the Church. In August 1962, Léger, disappointed in the preparatory schemata of the first conciliar period, petitioned John XXIII along with six of the leading European cardinals.

Léger stood out as a leader during the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) even though his positions cost him some friendships and made him some enemies. His activity mainly focused on ecumenism; family, including procreation and marriage; freedom of thought within the Church; the liturgy; religious freedom; and the place of the Holy Scriptures in the Church. Despite his prominence and popularity at the Council, his rigid stances created rivalries, including with some that supported secularization, liberalization and modernization of the Church.

From late December 1963 to early January 1964 Léger returned to his missionary work, travelling to Africa. After returning to Canada, he wanted to help leprosaria with his &quot;Fame Pereo&quot; charity. He began to divest some personal belongings to help the poor. He even went as far as to propose he leave his see in Montreal to apply himself to missionary work, but Paul VI rejected it.

Léger with the Quebec bishops and Archbishop Roy delicately negotiated with the government, resulting in major institutional revamping in education, health, and social services. Notably, Bill 60 led to the Department of Education&#x27;s establishment in 1964. Léger saved the Church contention with the government of Quebec by adopting conservative and equitable stances.

After the Council ended, Léger returned to the norm of overseeing his archdiocese. He faced resistance from Quiet Revolution forces when trying to implement aggiornamento. It was difficult to work with the clergy in his archdiocese, and his relationships with fellow bishops were strained. Léger engaged in Church administration as a member of the Sacred Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Sacred Congregation of Rites, the Sacred Consistorial Congregation, the Fabric of Saint Peter, the Pontifical Commission for the Revision of the Code of Canon Law, and the first assembly of the Synod of Bishops (1967). By 1967 Archbishop Roy took Léger&#x27;s spot as Pope Paul VI&#x27;s special Canada representative.

On November 9, 1967, Léger announced his resignation as archbishop of Montreal with the intent to devote himself to working among the African lepers. This decision caused an uproar in the media and surprised the public. Léger was enthralled with Africa. There were challenges and complexities with the changing landscape of Church in Montreal, including increased population and lack of proportional increase of staff and implementation of the Vatican&#x27;s directives.

Léger left Montreal on December 11, 1967, making some short stops, visiting leprosaria supported by Fame Pereo, before settling in the archdiocese of Yaoundé, Cameroon. There he established around 40 aid projects. Until 1979 he dedicated himself almost completely to his ministry, interrupted by two trips back to Montreal. He served on the Pontifical Commission for Migrants and Tourism (1972–79) and on the Sacred Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (1972–84).

== Death ==
In July 1984 Léger was admitted to Séminaire de Saint-Sulpice and spent his last two years confined to a wheelchair before dying at age 87 on November 13, 1991. He was the last surviving cardinal created by Pius XII.

== Views ==

=== Role during the Second Vatican Council ===
The cardinal was a leading liberal force at the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). With the assistance of Cardinals Antonio Caggiano and Norman Gilroy, he delivered one of the closing messages of the council on December 8, 1965.

=== Religious liberty ===
He supported religious liberty at the council.

=== Birth control ===
He was one of the council fathers who, in a speech delivered on October 29, 1964, concerning the document later promulgated as the Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot;, raised the question of a possible change in the Church&#x27;s teaching on birth control. In the same speech, he urged that the document place more emphasis on conjugal love as an end or purpose of marriage.

=== Antisemitism ===
He believed that the council fathers needed to issue a stronger declaration against antisemitism as a &quot;necessary act of a renewed Church&quot;.

=== Ecumenism ===
A cardinal elector in the 1963 papal conclave, Léger spoke at a session of the Faith and Order Commission in September 1963.

<text>Cabannes is a lunar impact crater that lies in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. The rim has been worn by subsequent impacts, with a smaller crater overlying the southern rim. However the formation has not been significantly reshaped by nearby craters.

The satellite crater Cabannes J is attached to the southeast rim, and lies between Cabannes and the heavily impacted crater Berlage. Just to the east is the crater Bellinsgauzen, and to the south is the large walled plain Antoniadi.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cabannes.

<text>Doubtful Sound / Patea is a fiord in Fiordland, in the far south west of New Zealand. It is located in the same region as the smaller but more famous and accessible Milford Sound / Piopiotahi. It took second place after Milford Sound as New Zealand&#x27;s most famous tourism destination.

At long, Doubtful Sound / Patea is the second longest, and with a depth of up to the deepest of the South Island&#x27;s fiords. In comparison with Milford Sound, it is more widespread, with the cliffs not as dramatically tall and near vertical. However, the U-shaped profile of the fiord is obvious, in particular on the two innermost of the main fiord&#x27;s arms and the hanging side valleys along the main fiord.

Like most of Fiordland, Doubtful Sound receives a high amount of rainfall, ranging from an annual average of . The vegetation on the mountainous landscape surrounding the fiord is dense native rainforest.

== History ==
Doubtful Sound was named &#x27;Doubtful Harbour&#x27; in 1770 by Captain Cook, who did not enter the inlet as he was uncertain whether it was navigable under sail. It was later renamed Doubtful Sound by whalers and sealers, although it is not technically a sound but a fiord.

A Spanish scientific expedition commanded by Alessandro Malaspina visited Doubtful Sound in February 1793 to conduct experiments measuring the force of gravity using a pendulum, a part of the effort to establish a new metric system. The officers of the expedition, which included Felipe Bauzá y Cañas, a cartographer, also made the first chart of the entrance and lower parts of the Sound, naming features of it. Today these form a unique cluster containing most of the Spanish names on the map of New Zealand: Febrero Point, Bauza Island and the Nee Islets, Pendulo Reach, and Malaspina Reach.

Following the passage of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998, the name of the fiord was officially altered to Doubtful Sound / Patea.

==Geography==

Doubtful Sound lies deep within the Fiordland National Park, about from the nearest inhabited place, the small town of Manapouri, and is surrounded by mountainous terrain with peaks typically reaching . Along the coast, there are no settlements for about in either direction.

There are three distinct arms to the sound, which all extend to the south from the main fiord. From the major conflux of water just south of Secretary Island, these arms are:
# First Arm, the shortest at long, 
# Crooked Arm, roughly halfway along the sound and the longest at long,
# Hall Arm ( long), which branches off from the Sound&#x27;s terminus at Deep Cove next to the prominent Commander Peak.

Crooked Arm reaches to within of Te Rā / Dagg Sound, almost cutting off a landmass of about .

The Sound is the site of several large waterfalls, notably Helena Falls at Deep Cove and the Browne Falls, which have a fall of over . The steep hills surrounding the main fiord and its arms are known for their hundreds of waterfalls during the rainy season.

Doubtful Sound contains about a dozen smaller islands, with the more notable ones being Elizabeth Island, Fergusson Island, Bauza Island, and the Shelter Islands. Parts of the sound on the west side of Elizabeth Island are protected by the Taipari Roa (Elizabeth Island) Marine Reserve.
The last quarter of the sound closest to the sea is dominated by islands, the major one being Secretary Island to the north. At the southernmost tip of the island, Doubtful Sound opens up as a confluence of 5 bodies of water. From the western seaward end and going clockwise, these are:
# Seaward end of Doubtful Sound, often referred to as &quot;The Gut&quot;
# Te Awa-o-Tū / Thompson Sound
# Kaikiekie / Bradshaw Sound
# Continuation of Doubtful Sound to Deep Cove (Malaspina Reach)
# First Arm

The narrow, shallower area of the sound between Bauza Island and Secretary Island (&quot;The Gut&quot;) offers more shelter than areas further to the west and towards the sea. It is a popular fishing and mooring location and is a haven for crayfish.

Thompson Sound and Bradshaw Sound join in a short stretch named &quot;Pendulo Reach&quot; southeast of Secretary Island, and containing the tiny Seymour Island.

Access to the sound is either by sea or via the isolated Wilmot Pass road from the Manapouri Power Station. Most areas of the sound itself are accessible only by sea, however, as the road network in this area of New Zealand is sparse or nonexistent, as is the human population.

Charles John Lyttelton, 10th Viscount Cobham, Governor-General of New Zealand (1957–1962) wrote about this part of Fiordland:

:&quot;There are just a few areas left in the world where no human has ever set foot. That one of them should be in a country so civilized and so advanced as New Zealand may seem incredible, unless one has visited the south-west corner of the South Island. Jagged razor backed mountains rear their heads into the sky. More than 200 days of rain a year ensure not a tree branch is left bare and brown, moss and epiphytes drape every nook. The forest is intensely green. This is big country... one day peaceful, a study in green and blue, the next melancholy and misty, with low cloud veiling the tops... an awesome place, with its granite precipices, its hanging valleys, its earthquake faults and its thundering cascades.&quot;

==Flora and fauna==

Doubtful Sound (like many of the fiords in the area) is unusual in that it contains two distinct layers of water that scarcely mix. The surface layer , referred to as the Low Salinity Layer or LSL, consists of diluted seawater with a typical salinity value of less than 10 psu. This layer receives fresh water fed from the high inflows from the surrounding mountains, and stained brown with tannins from the forest. The outflow of freshwater from the tailrace discharge from the Manapouri Power Station also influences the thickness of the LSL. Below the LSL is a layer of warmer, undiluted seawater with a salinity value of around 35 psu. The dark tannins in the fresh water layer make it difficult for light to penetrate. Thus, many deep-sea species grow in the comparatively shallow depths of the Sound. Such species include black coral &quot;Antipathes fiordensis&quot;, which is normally found at depths of but can be found at just in Doubtful Sound and is within the range of qualified recreational divers.

The catchment basin of Doubtful Sound is generally steep terrain that is heavily forested except for locations where surface rock exposures are extensive. Nothofagus trees are dominant in many locations. In the understory there are a wide variety of shrubs and ferns, including the crown fern, &quot;Blechnum discolor&quot;.

The fiord is home to one of the southernmost populations of bottlenose dolphins. The Doubtful Sound bottlenoses have formed a very insular subgroup of only about 70 individuals, with none having been observed to leave or enter the Sound during a multi-year monitoring regime. Their social grouping is thus extremely close, which is also partly attributed to the difficult and unusual features of their habitat, which is much colder than the habitats of other bottlenose groups and is also overlaid by the freshwater layer. Recently (2000s), there has been growing concern that the population is in significant decline, with calf survival rates having halved, as well as being noticeably lower than in captivity or in other New Zealand environments. The reasons for this are unclear, though increased tourism and the fresh-water discharge from the Manapouri Power Station (see Hydroelectricity section below) are considered potential causes.

Other wildlife to be found in Doubtful Sound includes fur seals and penguins, or even large whales. Southern right whales and humpback whales are the most frequently seen especially the later. Others include minke whale, sperm whale and some giant beaked whales). Orcas (killer whales) and long-finned pilot whales can be found also. The waters of Doubtful Sound are also home to an abundance of sea creatures, including many species of fish, starfish, sea anemones, and corals. It is perhaps best known for its black coral trees which occur in unusually shallow water for what is normally a deep-water species. The sound has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it is a breeding site for Fiordland penguins.
Secretary Island and Bauza Island are some of the most important sanctuaries in New Zealand for critically endangered birds.

==Hydroelectricity==

Deep Cove (), the innermost end of Doubtful Sound, is the site of discharge of water from the Manapouri Power Station&#x27;s tailrace tunnels. Deep Cove, like the rest of Fiordland, is a unique and mostly pristine environment. The discharge of clear fresh water has affected fauna and flora by letting light into the lower layers of the sound. Nevertheless, this is an area naturally high in fresh water inflows ( of rain falls annually).

The small wharf at Deep Cove is on rare occasion also used to unload any equipment for the Manapouri Power Station that is too large to be ferried across Lake Manapouri. From Deep Cove, such equipment then has to be hauled over Wilmot Pass to the power station.

==Tourism==

Unlike the more easily accessible Milford Sound, it is not possible to drive to Doubtful Sound, as the Wilmot Pass road is not connected to the road network and only connects the Manapouri Hydro Power Station with Deep Cove.

The only options for visitors to visit Doubtful Sound are boat cruises. The less common way to access Doubtful Sound is by sea. However, there are some boat cruises that operate out of the small town of Manapouri. These day trips first take a boat across Lake Manapouri and then a bus on the gravel road across Wilmot Pass to the Sound, where the Doubtful Sound tour boats berth at a small wharf in Deep Cove. The tour companies offer a day option out of Te Anau/Manapouri or an overnight option.

<doc id="559811" wikidata="Q5790897" url="?curid=559811" title="Lucas Heights, New South Wales">
<text>Lucas Heights is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is near to the Royal National Park.

==Geography==
It is located 31 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Sutherland Shire. Lucas Heights is located on the Woronora River, which flows north into the Georges River.

Unusually for a suburb, Lucas Heights does not contain a residential area. The residential area previously part of Lucas Heights was renamed Barden Ridge in 1996 to increase the real estate value of the area, as it would no longer be instantly associated with the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR).

==History==
Lucas Heights was named after John Lucas Senior, a flour miller who in 1823 was granted on the &#x27;head of unnamed stream into Georges River&#x27;. He built a water-driven mill for grinding corn from the Illawarra farms. Small ships sailed up the coast into Botany Bay, Georges River and the Woronora River.

==Commercial areas==
Lucas Heights has become notable as the site of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation’s (ANSTO) main research establishment, originally built by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission and home to the historic HIFAR research reactor.

HIFAR was shut down in January 2007 and superseded by the OPAL research reactor. OPAL consists of leading neutron radiation facilities and attracts international scientists as its staff members and many hundreds of third-party users. In 2005, Australian police suggested the HIFAR reactor was a possible target for a foiled terrorist bomb attack. 

Spent fuel from the OPAL research reactor is transported to Port Kembla, then exported to France for reprocessing.

The non-governmental Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering (AINSE) also has its headquarters at Lucas Heights.

Lucas Heights also hosts a (non-nuclear) waste management facility, which was for many years a major disposal site for sanitary carters. 

==Climate==
Due to its elevation, Lucas Heights is one of the few places in Sydney that has a borderline Oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;) and a Humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

<doc id="559815" wikidata="Q1143549" url="?curid=559815" title="Lenna">
<text>Lenna (or Lena) is a standard test image used in the field of digital image processing, starting in 1973. It is a picture of the Swedish model Lena Forsén, shot by photographer Dwight Hooker and cropped from the centerfold of the November 1972 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. The image has attracted controversy in recent years because of its subject matter, and many journals have deemed it inappropriate and discouraged its use, while others have banned it from publication outright. Forsén herself has called for it to be retired, saying &quot;It&#x27;s time I retired from tech.&quot;

The spelling &quot;Lenna&quot; came from the model&#x27;s desire to encourage the proper pronunciation of her name. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be called &quot;Lee&quot;na [],&quot; she explained.

== History ==
Before Lenna, the first use of a &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine image to illustrate image processing algorithms was in 1961. Lawrence G. Roberts used two cropped six-bit grayscale facsimile scanned images from &quot;Playboy&quot;&#x27;s July 1960 issue featuring Playmate Teddi Smith, in his MIT master&#x27;s thesis on image dithering.

The Lenna image was originally intended for high resolution color image processing study. Its history was described in the May 2001 newsletter of the IEEE Professional Communication Society, in an article by Jamie Hutchinson:

The image&#x27;s reach was limited in the 1970s and 80s, which is reflected in it initially only appearing in .org domains. But in July 1991, the image featured on the cover of &quot;Optical Engineering&quot; alongside Peppers, another popular test image. This drew the attention of &quot;Playboy&quot; to the potential copyright infringement. The peak of image hits on the internet was in 1995. The scan became one of the most used images in computer history. The use of the photo in electronic imaging has been described as &quot;clearly one of the most important events in [its] history&quot;. The image spread to over 100 different domains, particularly .com and .edu.

In a 1999 issue of &quot;IEEE Transactions on Image Processing&quot; &quot;Lena&quot; was used in three separate articles, and the picture continued to appear in scientific journals throughout the beginning of the 21st century.

Lenna is so widely accepted in the image processing community that Forsén was a guest at the 50th annual Conference of the Society for Imaging Science and Technology (IS&amp;T) in 1997. In 2015, Lena Forsén was also guest of honor at the banquet of IEEE ICIP 2015. After delivering a speech, she chaired the best paper award ceremony.

To explain why the image became a standard in the field, David C. Munson, editor-in-chief of &quot;IEEE Transactions on Image Processing&quot;, stated that it was a good test image because of its detail, flat regions, shading, and texture. He also noted that &quot;the Lena image is a picture of an attractive woman. It is not surprising that the (mostly male) image processing research community gravitated toward an image that they found attractive.&quot;

While &quot;Playboy&quot; often cracks down on illegal uses of its material and did initially send a notice to the publisher of &quot;Optical Engineering&quot; about its unauthorized use in that publication, over time it has decided to overlook the wide use of Lena. Eileen Kent, VP of new media at &quot;Playboy&quot;, said, &quot;We decided we should exploit this, because it is a phenomenon.&quot;

== Criticism ==
The use of the image has produced controversy because &quot;Playboy&quot; is &quot;seen (by some) as being degrading to women&quot;. In a 1999 essay on reasons for the male predominance in computer science, applied mathematician Dianne P. O&#x27;Leary wrote:
A 2012 paper on compressed sensing used a photo of the model Fabio Lanzoni as a test image to draw attention to this issue.

The use of the test image at the magnet school Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia, provoked a guest editorial by a senior in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 2015 about its detrimental impact on aspiring female students in computer science.

In 2017, the &quot;Journal of Modern Optics&quot; published an editorial titled &quot;On alternatives to Lenna&quot; suggesting three images (Pirate, Cameraman, and Peppers) that &quot;are reasonably close to Lenna in feature space&quot;.

In 2018, the &quot;Nature Nanotechnology&quot; journal announced that they would no longer consider articles using the Lenna image. In the same year SPIE, the publishers of &quot;Optical Engineering&quot;, also announced that they &quot;strongly discourage&quot; the use of the Lenna image, and would no longer consider new submissions containing the image &quot;without convincing scientific justification for its use&quot;. They noted that aside from the copyright and ethical issues, that it was also no longer useful as a standard image: &quot;In today&#x27;s age of high-resolution digital image technology, it seems difficult to argue that a 512 × 512 image produced with a 1970s-era analog scanner is the best we have to offer as an image quality test standard&quot;.

Forsén stated in the 2019 documentary film &quot;Losing Lena&quot;, &quot;I retired from modeling a long time ago. It&#x27;s time I retired from tech, too... Let&#x27;s commit to losing me.&quot;

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) announced that, starting April 1, 2024, it will no longer allow use of the Lena image in its publications.

<text>Blacktown is a suburb in the City of Blacktown local government area, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Blacktown is located west of the Sydney central business district. It is one of the most multicultural places within Greater Sydney.

==History==

Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, the area of today&#x27;s Blacktown was inhabited by different groups of the Darug people including the Warmuli, based around what is now Prospect, and their neighbours the Gomerigal from the South Creek area and the Wawarawarry from the Eastern Creek area. It is estimated that fifty to ninety percent of the Darug died of smallpox and other introduced diseases within a few years of the British arrival. Governor Arthur Phillip began granting land in the area to white settlers in 1791. In 1819 Governor Lachlan Macquarie granted land to two Indigenous men, Colebee and Nurragingy as payment for their service to The Crown, for assisting Cox with the road over the Blue Mountains and in dealing with Aboriginal issues.

In 1823, the Native Institution (a school for Aboriginal children) was moved from Parramatta to the site where Richmond Road meets Rooty Hill Road North (this intersection is now in the suburbs of Oakhurst and Glendenning) which was named &quot;The BlackTown&quot;. The institution was then known as Black Town Native Institute and its role in the removal of Aboriginal children from their families and their isolation from their heritage and culture was an early part of the history of the stolen generation. Although the institution closed in 1833, the road heading out to the Institute became known as the Black Town Road. In 1860 the Railway Department gave the name of Black Town Road Station to the railway station at the junction of the railway and the Black Town Road, with the name shortening to Blacktown by 1862.

The arrival of the railway led to the formation of a town around the station. A post office was opened in 1862 and a school in 1877. In 1906, the Shire of Blacktown was formed and in 1930, electricity was introduced to the town. The population in 1933 was then around 13,000. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a large amount of suburban development both in the current suburb of Blacktown and the new suburbs that sprung up around it. This led to civic development in the town centre with the world&#x27;s first Westfield opening in 1959, the hospital opening in 1965, the courthouse and police station in 1966, the library in 1967 and the TAFE college in 1969. In 1973, the Westpoint shopping centre opened which was soon followed by the cinema complex.

Since that time, Blacktown has endured as a multiculturally diverse suburb of Sydney, with residents from more than 130 countries.

== Climate ==
Blacktown experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa/Cfb&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Cfbl/Cfal&quot;), with moderately hot, moderately rainy summers and cold, moderately dry winters, and experiences precipitation year-round. Like Greater Western Sydney, Blacktown has a greater annual temperature range between winter and summer, and receives less precipitation than on Sydney Observatory Park. 

Summers are moderately hot and humid, having a similar average temperature to Port Jackson, but diurnal temperature range is higher from the lack of coastal sea breezes from the Tasman Sea, which only make up to the suburb of Homebush, which is east of Blacktown, which also reduces summer precipitation . In addition, 29.6 days will exceed 30 °C (86 °F), which is more than twice as common compared to Observatory Park, which only records 11.1 days exceeding the same threshold. Extremes range from 41.7 °C (107.1 °F) on 30 December 1965 to 8.3 °C (46.9 °F) on 2 February 1965.

Winters are cold and moderately dry. Due to its inland position further from the Tasman Sea, it typically records 11.0 nights below 5 °C (41 °F) and 2.3 nights below 0 °C (32 °F), which is cold compared to the Sydney CBD, which on an average year, records zero nights below 5 °C (41 °F), allowing light frosts on many winter mornings. Southwesterly winds, known as frontal lows often affect Blacktown in the winter, but lose much of their moisture over the Victorian Alps and Great Dividing Range, making this the driest season in Blacktown. Extremes range from 27.8 °C (82.0 °F) on 25 August 1972 to –3.9 °C (25.0 °F) on 16 July 1970.

==Commercial area==
The Blacktown Commercial Business District is located close to Blacktown railway station. Westpoint Blacktown is a major shopping centre and there are a number of small shops, restaurants and hotels in the surrounding area. Westpoint also houses a western suburb television studio of the Nine Network. The Blacktown CBD features the following landmarks:
* An Australian Catholic University campus
* Blacktown City Council corporate head office
* Blacktown Courthouse
* Blacktown Hospital
* Blacktown Workers Club
* Cucina Locale Revolving Restaurant
* Max Webber Library – Blacktown City Council&#x27;s central library
* Patrician Brothers&#x27; College Blacktown
* Nagle College Blacktown
A notable Blacktown retailer in the 1950s was Frank Lowy who conducted a delicatessen and small goods shop in Main Street.


==Transport==
According to the 2021 census, the most common way of getting to work from Blacktown was by car (48.3%) with public transport used by 7.9%. Most public transport was done by train (3.3%) with 1.7% catching buses for all or part of their journey. Blacktown railway station is on the North Shore &amp; Western Line and the Cumberland Line of the Sydney Trains network. A major bus interchange is located next to the station and an underground bus station is at the entrance to Westpoint. Blacktown is a terminus of the North-West T-way.

Busways provides services to Northern areas (Rouse Hill, Castle Hill, Kellyville, Glenwood and Stanhope Gardens), West areas (Mount Druitt, Plumpton, Oakhurst, Quakers Hill, Dean Park, Woodcroft) and South districts (Prospect, Arndell Park, Huntingwood, Tallawong, Doonside, Blacktown Hospital), whilst CDC NSW provides Eastern services (Macquarie Park, Seven Hills, Parramatta, Kings Langley).

==Schools==
The first school, a single-storey brick building with gables, was opened in 1877. While no longer in use as a school, the building in Flushcombe Road is now used as a Visitor Information Centre. It is the oldest remaining building in the Blacktown CBD and is heritage-listed.

Government-run primary schools in the area include: Blacktown North Public School, Blacktown South Public School, Blacktown West Public School, Lynwood Park Public School, Marayong South Public School, Shelley Public School, and Walters Road Public School. Public high schools include: Blacktown Boys High School, Blacktown Girls High School, Evans High School and Mitchell High School. There is also the Coreen School, which caters to older children with learning difficulties.

There are two Catholic primary schools, St Michael&#x27;s and St Patrick&#x27;s, and two Catholic high schools, Nagle College for girls and Patrician Brothers&#x27; College Blacktown for boys. Tyndale Christian School is a private school accepting children from kindergarten to year 12.

==Blacktown Arts Centre==
Blacktown Arts Centre is located at 78 Flushcombe Road on the highest point of land in the Blacktown CBD.

Originally built in the 1950s as an Anglican church, the building was deconsecrated in 1999. Originally acquired by Blacktown Council as a site for a car park, the Council in partnership with Arts NSW subsequently refurbished the building as a multi-arts centre.

The centre opened to the public in October 2002. In 2006 the centre underwent a multimillion-dollar refit and extension. The building reopened in April 2007 with facilities for performance, extended visual art galleries, workshop space and enhanced administrative areas.

<text>Rudnaya Pristan (, lit. &quot;Ore Wharf&quot;) is a village (&quot;selo&quot;) located at the mouth of the Rudnaya River, on the Pacific coast of Primorsky Krai. It is situated 35 km east of Dalnegorsk (also in Primorsky Krai) and approximately 514 km north of Vladivostok. Its population was 2,107 in 2010, 2,389 in 2002, and 2,947 in 1989.

Lead smelting has been the town&#x27;s primary industry since a plant was built there in 1930. The plant has provided steady employment for most of the area&#x27;s families since that time, but at enormous cost to both the health of the residents and the local environment. The residents suffer from many health problems, including an inordinately high rate of cancer, and the soil has become heavily contaminated with lead-related by-products. The Blacksmith Institute consequently declared Rudnaya Pristan, along with Dalnegorsk, one of the ten worst polluted places on earth, although Anatoly Lebedev, leader of the ecological NGO &quot;BROK&quot;, disputes this inclusion.

Despite its coastal location, Rudnaya Pristan&#x27;s harbor has remained largely undeveloped, and its climate is harsh, dominated in winter by the vast Siberian high-pressure system and in summer by remnants of the East Asian monsoon. This combination results in very cold, dry winters with generally high winds, and muggy summers that provide ideal conditions for the breeding of mosquitoes.

<doc id="559834" wikidata="Q1411290" url="?curid=559834" title="Manapouri Power Station">
<text>Manapōuri Power Station is an underground hydroelectric power station on the western arm of Lake Manapouri in Fiordland National Park, in the South Island of New Zealand. At 854 MW installed capacity (although limited to 800 MW due to resource consent limits), it is the largest hydroelectric power station in New Zealand, and the second largest power station in New Zealand. The station is noted for the controversy and environmental protests by the Save Manapouri Campaign against raising the level of Lake Manapouri to increase the station&#x27;s hydraulic head, which galvanised New Zealanders and was one of the foundations of the New Zealand environmental movement.

Completed in 1971, Manapōuri was built primarily to supply electricity for the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter near Bluff, some to the southeast. The station utilises the drop between the western arm of Lake Manapouri and the Deep Cove branch of the Doubtful Sound away to generate electricity. The construction of the station required the excavation of almost 1.4 million tonnes of hard rock to build the machine hall and a 10 km tailrace tunnel, with a second parallel tailrace tunnel completed in 2002 to increase the station&#x27;s capacity.

Since April 1999, the power station has been owned and operated by state-owned electricity generator Meridian Energy.

==Construction==
The power station machine hall was excavated from solid granite rock 200 metres below the level of Lake Manapōuri. Two tailrace tunnels take the water that passes through the power station to Deep Cove, a branch of Doubtful Sound, away.

Access to the power station is via a two-kilometre vehicle-access tunnel which spirals down from the surface, or a lift that drops down from the control room above the lake. There is no road access into the site; a regular boat service ferries power station workers in 35 km across the lake from Pearl Harbour, located in the town of Manapouri at the southeast corner of the lake.

This same access was for many years used to ferry tourists for public tours of the site, but since 2018 maintenance work by Meridian Energy means tours are closed &quot;for an indefinite period&quot;.

The original construction of the power station cost NZ$135.5 million (NZ$2.15 billion in 2013 dollars), involved almost 8 million man hours to construct, and claimed the lives of 16 workers.

Soon after the power station began generating at full capacity in 1972, engineers confirmed a design problem. Greater than anticipated friction between the water and the tailrace tunnel walls meant reduced hydrodynamic head. For 30 years, until 2002, station operators risked flooding the powerhouse if they ran the station at an output greater than (with high lake level and a low tide the station could generate up to ), far short of the designed peak capacity of . Construction of a second tailrace tunnel in the late 1990s, long and 10 metres in diameter, finally solved the problem and increased capacity to . The increased exit flow also increased the effective head, allowing the turbines to generate more power without using more water.

==History==

===Early history===
The first surveyors mapping out this corner of New Zealand noted the potential for hydro generation in the 178-metre drop from the lake to the Tasman Sea at Doubtful Sound. The idea of building a power station was first formulated by Peter Hay, the Superintending Engineer of the Public Works Department, and Lemuel Morris Hancock, the Electrical Engineer and General Superintendent of the Transmission Department of the California Gas and Electric Company during their November 1903 inspection of Lakes Manapōuri and Te Anau. Each of the 1904 reports by Hay and Hancock noted the hydraulic potential of the lake systems, being so high above sea level, and while the rugged isolation of the region meant that it would be neither practical nor economic to generate power for domestic consumption, the engineers realised that the location and scale of the project made it uniquely suited to electro-industrial developments such as electro-chemical or electro-metallurgical production.

In January 1926, a Wellington-based syndicate of ten businessmen headed by Joseph Orchiston and Arthur Leigh Hunt, &quot;New Zealand Sounds Hydro-Electric Concessions Limited&quot;, was granted by the government via an Order in Council the rights to develop the waters which discharged into Deep Cove, Doubtful Sound, and the waters of Lake Manapōuri, to generate in total some . The company attempted to attract Australian, British and American finance to develop the project, which would have required the construction of a powerhouse and factory complex in Deep Cove, with accommodation for an estimated 2,000 workers and wharf facilities, with the complex producing atmospheric nitrogen in the form of fertiliser and munitions. Various attempts to finance the scheme were not successful, with the water rights lapsing and the company fading into obscurity by the 1950s.

In 1955 the modern history of Manapōuri starts, when Harry Evans, a New Zealand geologist with Consolidated Zinc Proprietary Ltd identified a commercial deposit of bauxite in Australia on the west coast of Cape York Peninsula, near Weipa. It turned out to be the largest deposit of bauxite in the world yet discovered. In 1956 The Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Pty Ltd, later known as Comalco, was formed to develop the bauxite deposits. The company started investigating sources of large quantities of cheap electricity needed to reduce the alumina recovered from the bauxite into aluminium. Comalco settled on Manapōuri as that source of power and Bluff as the site of the smelter. The plan was to refine the bauxite to alumina in Queensland, ship the alumina to New Zealand for smelting into metal, then ship it away to market.

===Construction history===
*February 1963, Bechtel Pacific Corporation won the design and supervision contract.
*July 1963, Utah Construction and Mining Company and two local firms won contracts to construct the tailrace tunnel and Wilmot Pass road. Utah Construction also won the powerhouse contract.
*August 1963, &quot;Wanganella&quot;, a former passenger liner, was moored in Doubtful Sound to be used as a hostel for workers building the tailrace tunnel. During the 1930s she was a top-rated trans-Tasman passenger liner, with accommodation for 304 first-class passengers. She continued to serve as a hostel until December 1969.
*February 1964, tailrace-tunnel construction began.
*December 1967, powerhouse construction was completed.
*October 1968, tunnel breakthrough.
*14 September 1969, the first water flowed through the power station.
*September/October 1969, commissioning of the first four generators.
*August/September 1971, the remaining three generators were commissioned.
*1972, the station was commissioned. It was then that engineers confirmed the limitations of peak capacity due to excess friction in the tailrace tunnel.
*June 1997, construction work by a Dillingham Construction / Fletcher Construction / Ilbau joint venture began on the second tailrace tunnel.
*1998, the Robbins tunnel boring machine starts drilling at the Deep Cove end of the tunnel.
*2001, tunnel breakthrough.
*2002, the second tunnel was commissioned. A $98 million mid-life refurbishment of the seven generator units begins, with the goal of raising their eventual output to 135 MVA (121.5 MW) each. By June 2006, four generating units had been upgraded, and the project was on schedule for completion in August 2007. By the end of 2007, all seven turbines had been upgraded.
*2014, three transformers were replaced following the discovery of an issue with the oil cooler on one of Manapōuri&#x27;s seven transformers during maintenance in March. The first removed transformer was the largest pieces of hardware to leave the station since its completion. The three transformers were replaced with newly manufactured ones, delivered via Wilmot Pass between December 2014 and February 2015.

===Political history===
In July 1956, the New Zealand Electricity Department announced the possibility of a project using the Manapōuri water, an underground power station and underground tailrace tunnel discharging the water at &quot;Deep Cove&quot; in Doubtful Sound. Five months later, Consolidated Zinc Proprietary Limited (later known as Comalco) formally approached the New Zealand government about acquiring a large amount of electricity for aluminium smelting.

On 2 May 1961 Stan Goosman for the Ministry of Works for the First National Government, signed an agreement making it binding on any future government for this project to go ahead, On 19 January 1960, the Labour Government and Consolidated Zinc/Comalco signed a formal agreement for Consolidated Zinc to build both an aluminium smelter at Tiwai Point and a power station in Manapōuri. The agreement violated the National Parks Act, which provided for formal protection of the Park, and required subsequent legislation to validate the development. Consolidated Zinc/Comalco received exclusive rights to the waters of both Lakes Manapōuri and Te Anau for 99 years. Consolidated Zinc/Comalco planned to build dams that would raise Lake Manapōuri by , and merge the two lakes. The Save Manapouri Campaign was born, marking the beginning of the modern New Zealand environmental movement.

In 1963, Consolidated Zinc/Comalco decided it could not afford to build the power station. The New Zealand government took over. Electricity generated by the plant was sold to Consolidated Zinc/Comalco at under an arrangement designed to return the cost of building the power station to the government.

In 1969, Consolidated Zinc&#x27;s electric power rights were transferred to Comalco Power (NZ) Ltd, a subsidiary of the Australian-based Comalco Industries Pty Ltd.

In 1970, the Save Manapouri Campaign organised a petition to Parliament opposing raising the water level of Lake Manapōuri. The petition attracted 264,907 signatures, equivalent to nearly 10 percent of New Zealand&#x27;s population at the time.

In 1972, New Zealand elected a new Labour government. In 1973, the Prime Minister, Norman Kirk, honoured his party&#x27;s election pledge not to raise the levels of the lakes. He created an independent body, the Guardians of Lake Manapōuri, Monowai, and Te Anau, to oversee management of the lake levels. The original six &quot;Guardians&quot; were all prominent leaders of the Save Manapouri Campaign.

In 1984, the Labour Party returned to power in the general election. The resulting period was tumultuous, with Labour&#x27;s controversial ministers Roger Douglas and Richard Prebble driving rogernomics, a rapid introduction of &quot;free market&quot; reforms and privatisation of government assets. Many suspected the Manapōuri Power station would be sold, and Comalco was the obvious buyer. In 1991, the Save Manapouri Campaign was revived, with many of the same leaders and renamed &quot;Power For Our Future&quot;. The Campaign opposed selling off the power station to ensure that Comalco did not rehabilitate its plans to raise Lake Manapouri&#x27;s waters. The Campaign was successful. The government announced that Manapōuri would not be sold to Comalco.

On 1 April 1999 - the 1998 reform of the New Zealand electricity sector took effect: the Electricity Corporation of New Zealand was broken up and Manapōuri was transferred to new state-owned generator Meridian Energy.

In 2002, the Government rejected an application of a business, Southland Water 2000, to bottle 40,000 cubic metres of water in 20 hours, twelve times a year, before the water from the power station is released into Doubtful Sound.

In July 2020, Rio Tinto announced that they would be closing the aluminium smelter in Bluff in August 2021, triggering discussions on how to utilise the energy generated in Manapouri. In January 2021, Rio Tinto said they would keep the smelter open until December 2024.

In May 2024, New Zealand Aluminium Smelters (NZAS) signed a 20-year electricity arrangement that guaranteed the future of the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter until at least 2044. NZAS, which owns and operates Tiwai Point, has signed contracts with electricity generators Meridian Energy, Contact Energy and Mercury NZ to set pricing for an aggregate of 572 megawatts (MW) of electricity to meet the smelter&#x27;s full electricity needs. The agreements, which are subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions, are expected to commence in July 2024 and run until at least 2044.

==Specifications and statistics==

===Power station===


===Civil engineering===
==Operation==
The massive inertia of the column of water in the long tailrace tunnel makes rapid changes to Manapōuri&#x27;s generation difficult. Further, because the tailrace tunnel emerges at sea level in Deep Cove, power production can be influenced by the state of the tide there. The maximum tidal range is 2·3 metres (7&#x27;8&quot;) which is a little over one percent of the station&#x27;s head. The plot shows a variation of about 5MW linked not to the usual twenty-four-hour cycle of electricity usage but to the times of high and low tide, which cycle around the clock.


==Transmission==
Manapōuri is connected to the rest of the National Grid via two double-circuit 220 kV transmission lines. One line connects Manapōuri to Tiwai Point via North Makarewa substation, north of Invercargill, while the other line connects Manapōuri to Invercargill substation, with one circuit also connecting to North Makarewa substation. Another double-circuit 220 kV line connects Invercargill to Tiwai Point.

If Tiwai Point reduced demand or closed, Manapōuri generation would have to be reduced to prevent overloading the transmission lines out of the lower South Island. The Clutha Upper Waitaki Lines Project (CULWP) started construction to relieve this constraint, allowing an extra 400 megawatts to be sent north.

The Clutha Upper Waitaki Lines Project (CUWLP) was completed in April 2022. The project involved five components with a total approved cost of $197,000,000. The first two components (which keep Southland secure during dry periods) were delivered in 2015 and 2016 at a cost of around $38,000,000. In December 2020, Transpower completed the work on the Cromwell-Twizel circuits, and then in April 2022 finished the duplexing of the 142 km Roxburgh–Islington line.

<text>Lake Manapouri () is located in the South Island of New Zealand. The lake is situated within the Fiordland National Park and the wider region of Te Wahipounamu South West New Zealand World Heritage Area.

==Māori History==
According to Māori legend Lake Manapouri was created by the tears of two sisters, Moturua and Koronae, who were daughters of an old chief in the region. Koronae journeyed deep into the forest one day only to become stranded after a fall. Her sister Moturua went looking for her and when she found Koronae she realised that Koronae could not be rescued. Moturua lay with Koronae and there they lay until they died, their tears creating Lake Manapouri. Lake Manapouri means anxious or sorrowful heart because of the grief of the two sisters. However, the present name was given by mistake. An early settler accidentally called it by the name of one of the Mavora Lakes, which lie between Lake Te Anau and Lake Wakatipu. The original name of the lake is believed to have been Roto-ua which translates to Rainy Lake and later Moturau which means Many Islands. Māori have a long history in the area, finding the lake and its surroundings offering an abundance of food in the form of eels and birds such as pigeon and Kākā (forest parrot). Manapouri was discovered by Europeans in 1852, by the explorers Charles J Nairn and W H Stevens.

==Geography==
Lake Manapouri was formed by glaciers during the last Holocene. The lake is New Zealand’s second deepest lake measuring deep. Lake Manapouri is above sea level however due to glaciers, Lake Manapouri has been cut deep into the ground and the bottom of the lake now lies below sea level. The lake has four arms, North, South, West and Hope with the smaller indentations of Shallow Bay and Calm Bay. Lake Manapouri contains 33 islands in total with 22 of these being wooded. Lying close to the centre of the lake is the largest island of Pomona Island. Other large islands include Holmwood Island, Rona Island and Mahara Island. The small settlement of Manapouri lies on the eastern shore.
The Waiau River (Southland) is both a natural inlet and outlet for the lake, flowing into the northeast of the lake from Lake Te Anau, to the north and flowing out from Manapouri&#x27;s south-eastern end. The outlet however has been diverted due to the development of Manapōuri Hydroelectric Power Station. Water now flows unnaturally westward to the sea at Deep Cove. Rainfall in the area is high, however due to the mountains in the west rainfall is much higher in this area. The average rainfall for the western arm of Lake Manapouri is annually, while Manapouri Township on the eastern arm of the lake receives less than a third at annually. Lake Manapouri drains a large catchment area of . This includes the slopes of the Kepler Mountains, Turret Range and Hunter Mountains which surround all but the eastern shore of the lake. Water levels in the lake are predominantly high during spring due to snow melt and low in winter.

Lake Manapouri is often described as New Zealand’s most beautiful lake.

==Biodiversity==
The area is well renowned for its fishing and high water quality. Both Lake Manapouri and Lake Te Anau lie within the ultra-oligotrophic index on the trophic state index with clear highly oxygenated waters of very low biological productivity. Both lakes along with the connecting Waiau River contain the New Zealand longfin eel and introduced brown trout and rainbow trout as well as some Atlantic salmon. The area is however free from macrophyte Lagarosiphon major an exotic and invasive species which has infiltrated many other New Zealand lakes.

Lake Manapouri provides 73% of New Zealand’s longfin eel lake habitat protected from commercial fishing. However the lake has experienced a decline in numbers of longfin eels due to the construction of the hydro- electric dam blocking eel migration. The outflow passage is blocked by the hydro-electric dam which means that eels can be killed when passing through the turbines. A vertical slot fish pass was installed in 1999 and trap and transfer of elvers (young eels) was started in summer 1998/1999. Since the trap and transfer operation commenced in 1998/99 more than 407,000 elvers have been transferred upstream of the Maraoa Control structure. Catch totals in the trap and transfer system can vary in correspondence to surface water temperatures falling below . The trap and transfer technique was successful in improving fish distribution however operations had to be stopped in 2004 due to the concerns that transferring elvers to upstream habitats would spread the exotic invasive algae &quot;Didymosphenia geminata&quot;. The operation now transfers elvers just past the dam due to these concerns. There is concerns also that the trap and transfer operation does not trap enough silvers eels (eels of breeding age) with an average of 200-400 annually. This however equates to only one silver eel per hectare within the lake which is much lower than standards recommended overseas. More research is needed to understand if trap and transfer is the best option in Lake Manapouri.

Submerged vegetation within Lake Manapouri is mostly native species. Lake Manapouri has a high diversity of submerged vegetation. The rare Hydatella inconspicua an endemic shallow water plant was found in many of the Fiordland lakes including Lake Manapouri in 1998, this was the first reporting of it being in the South Island. The finding meant that the plant was no longer considered endangered.

==Surroundings==

The shoreline in the North and West of the lake remains substantially unaltered since deglaciation. Beaches have formed on the lake where rivers bring sediment to areas where the near shore relief is not too steep allowing pocket beaches to form. The beaches around the lake show many similarities to ocean shores. The shape of the lake funnels wind and waves down the long axis which leads to longshore transport or littoral drift of sediment and size selective sorting. There are however a number of differences to ocean shores. The short fetch length produces a narrow range of wave conditions and this low energy limits the size of sediment in transport. Large changes to the beach profile are induced by fluctuations in lake level, major fluctuations can drown beaches. The beaches on the lake develop a distinctive shelf profile whereby beach sediments grade lakeward into fine sand. The outer edge of the shelf is marked by a shelf break and a transition to organic-rich muds on a steep offshore slope. There are a number of different types of beaches including pavement beaches, gravel, mixed sand and gravel beaches and sand beaches.
The islands around Lake Manapouri are of varying size and isolation. Many of the islands contain virtually unmodified vegetation. However, there is large diversity between islands in habitat biodiversity, with some islands being completely devoid of plants and soil and other rich in both. There is confusion as to some differences with some researchers finding that the area of an island plays a role in species richness with others find no correlation at all. Red deer have greatly modified much of Fiordlands&#x27; vegetation however only the two largest islands within Lake Manapouri contain introduced red deer while other islands are only occasionally visited by deer. The smaller islands around Lake Manapouri are extremely unusual as they contain natural vegetation which has not been harmed by red deer, as the red deer have not been able to reach the islands. On these islands palatable plants as well as deep moss mat on the forest floor persist under the dense understory layers of the forest. 
The Australian brush-tail possum (&quot;Trichosurus vulpecula&quot;) is not present on the islands.

==Hydro-power from the lake==
The lake provides hydro-electric power via the Manapōuri Hydroelectric Power Station, in the West Arm, which discharges water through two tailrace tunnels to the sea at Deep Cove in Doubtful Sound. In 1959 Consolidated Zinc, with the support of the New Zealand government, planned to raise the lake by up to for an increase in power generation for the development of an aluminium smelter. This resulted in a strong nationwide protest, the Save Manapouri campaign, lasting over a decade, which prevented the raising of the lake from taking place. The Save Manapouri campaign is regarded as a major milestone in the history of New Zealand&#x27;s environmental protection. As a result of the campaign, lake levels were required to be maintained at close to natural levels. The win also saw the establishment in 1973 of the Guardians of Lake Manapouri and Te Anau. 

The water pumped through the station is discharged into Doubtful Sound, accounting for 41 percent of the fresh water consumed in New Zealand in 2010. In 2002, the Government — under pressure from the environmental movement — rejected an application of a business, Southland Water 2000, to bottle 40,000 cubic metres of water in 20 hours, twelve times a year, before the water from the power station is released into Doubtful Sound.

==Integrated management of the lake==
The environmental movement of Save Manapouri campaign is considered to be the first environmental movement in New Zealand. When this movement won the campaign to stop levels on the lake being raised, the government formed the Guardians of Lake Manapouri and Te Anau. This meant that main campaigners during the Save Manapouri campaign were appointed to advise the managers of the hydro-electric power plant on the management of both Lake Manapouri and Lake Te Anau. This holistic management between nature conservation and hydro-electric development was unprecedented in New Zealand.

The group was to “report and make recommendations of Government… on any matter arising from the environmental, ecological and social effects of the construction and operation of the Manapouri-Te Anau electric power scheme on the townships of Manapouri and Te Anau, the lakes and shorelines of Te Anau and Manapouri, and the rivers flowing in and out of these lakes with particular reference to the effects of lake levels on scenic values, conservation, recreation, tourism and other related activities and amenities”. The guardians were entitled to reports from the Government on actions that had been taken that were deemed relevant so they could fulfil their jobs.

Defining the natural variation of lake levels was considered very important. The lake had already experienced slumping due to a lowered lake level. Also the forest that surrounded the lake was reliant on a variation of water levels. Shoreline beech forest extended almost 3m below the highest natural lake level. The roots of this forest could be submerged for a maximum of 50 days meaning that lake levels needed to be maintained within a range that did not exceed this maximum. The raising of the lake levels too high also had the potential to submerge low-lying islands, many of which contained natural vegetation unharmed by red deer.

Lake management guidelines were devised from geomorphological and ecological studies correlated with a 37-year lake level record. The concepts of High, Main and Low Operating Ranges were developed as a basis for management guidelines. The guidelines were verified in practice and incorporated into legislation in 1981. In 1987 the groundings for the Resource Management Act 1991 were being laid. The Government decided that all empowering legislation for hydro-electric stations should be re-issued. For Lake Manapouri this meant a public process was established whereby a working party was formed to examine and resolve a wide range of environmental issues. Lake management guidelines and shoreline monitoring were formalised under resource consents. Also included in the consents was the creation of regulation patterns through the Te Anau and Manapouri control structures to follow more closely to the natural fluctuations of the Waiau River. The resource consent set up legislation which could restore biological and recreational values to the lower river, particularly the section immediately below the dam. Compensation was also granted for a range of adverse environmental effects associated with the diverting of water through the power station.

The Guardians of the Lake were given legal status in the 1990 amendment to the Conservation Act 1987 with additional and similar responsibility for Lake Monowai. The guardians are still active in 2012 and working alongside Meridian Energy, the current owner of the Lake Manapouri Hydroelectric Power Station.

<doc id="559838" wikidata="Q14594695" url="?curid=559838" title="Backtick">
<text>The backtick is a typographical mark used mainly in computing. It is also known as backquote, grave, or [[grave accent]].

The character was designed for typewriters to add a grave accent to a (lower-case) base letter, by overtyping it atop that letter. On early computer systems, however, this physical dead key+overtype function was rarely supported, being functionally replaced by precomposed characters. Consequently, this ASCII symbol was rarely (if ever) used in computer systems for its original aim and became repurposed for many unrelated uses in computer programming.

The sign is located on the left-top of a US or UK layout keyboard, next to the key. Provision (if any) of the backtick on other keyboards varies by national keyboard layout and keyboard mapping.

==History==
===Typewriters===

On typewriters designed for languages that routinely use diacritics (accent marks), there are two possible solutions. Keys can be dedicated to pre-composed characters or alternatively a dead key mechanism can be provided. With the latter, a mark is made when a dead key is typed but, unlike normal keys, the paper carriage does not move on and thus, the next letter to be typed is printed under the accent.

===Incorporation into ISO 646 and ASCII===

The incorporation of the grave symbol into ASCII is a consequence of this prior existence on typewriters. This symbol did not exist independently as a type or hot-lead printing character.
Thus, ISO646 was born and the ASCII standard updated to include the backtick and other symbols.

===As surrogate of apostrophe or (opening) single quote===

Some early typewriters and ASCII peripherals designed the backtick and apostrophe to be mirror images of each other. This allowed them to be used as matching pairs of open and close quotes, and also as grave and acute accents, and allowed the apostrophe to be used as a prime. None of these were considered typographically correct.

However, the use of apostrophe for opening quotes, the need on some typewriters to overprint apostrophe and period to get an exclamation mark, and the lack of a mirrored double-quote character tended to change the apostrophe to the modern &quot;typewriter&quot; design that is vertical. Unicode now provides separate characters for opening and closing quotes.

This has style remained in use in certain situations, such as in output generated by some UNIX console programs, rendering of man pages within some environments, and old technical documentation. This style is falling out of favor over time, and some institutions that traditionally used it have since abandoned it.

== Computing ==

=== Command-line interface languages ===
Many command-line interface languages and the scripting (programming) languages like Perl, PHP, Ruby and Julia (though see below) use pairs of backticks to indicate command substitution. A command substitution is the standard output from one command, into an embedded line of text within another command. For example, using $ as the symbol representing a terminal prompt, the code line:

In all POSIX shells (including Bash and Zsh), the use of backticks for command substitution is now largely deprecated in favor of the notation codice_1, so that the example above would be re-written:

The new syntax allows nesting, for example:

=== Markup languages ===
It is sometimes used in source code comments to indicate code, e.g.,

This is also the format the Markdown formatter uses to indicate code. Some variations of Markdown support &quot;fenced code blocks&quot; that span multiple lines of code, starting (and ending) with three backticks in a row (codice_2).

* TeX: The backtick character represents curly opening quotes. For example, codice_3 is rendered as single opening curly quote () and codice_4 is a double curly opening quote (). It also supplies the numeric ASCII value of an ASCII character wherever a number is expected.

=== Programming languages ===
* BBC BASIC: The backtick character is valid at the beginning of or within a variable, structure, procedure or function name.
* D and Go: The backtick surrounds a raw string literal.
* F#: Surrounding an identifier with double backticks allows the use of identifiers that would not otherwise be allowed, such as keywords, or identifiers containing punctuation or spaces.
* Haskell: Surrounding a function name by backticks makes it an infix operator.
* JavaScript: ECMAScript 6 standard introduced a &quot;backtick&quot; character which indicated a string or template literal. Its applications include (but are not limited to): string interpolation (substitution), embedded expressions, and multi-line strings. In the following example codice_5 and codice_6 variable&#x27;s values get substituted into the string enclosed by grave accent characters:
const name = &quot;Mary&quot;, pet = &quot;lamb&quot;; // Set variables
let temp = `${name} has a little ${pet}!`;
 console.log(temp);
 // =&gt; &quot;Mary has a little lamb!&quot;;
* Lisp macro systems: The backtick character (called &quot;quasiquote&quot; in Scheme) introduces a quoted expression in which comma-substitution may occur. It is identical to the plain quote, except that a nested expression prefixed with a comma is replaced with the value of that nested expression. If the nested expression happens to be a symbol (that is, a variable name in Lisp), the symbols&#x27; value is used. If the expression happens to be program code, the first value returned by that code is inserted at the respective location instead of the comma-prefixed code. This is roughly analogous to the Bourne shell&#x27;s variable interpolation with codice_7 inside double quotes.
* Julia: Backticks make a command object, codice_8, that can be run, with run function, like codice_9. You can interpolate Julia variables, but only indirectly shell environment variables.
* m4: A backtick together with an apostrophe quotes strings (to suppress or defer macro expansion).
* MySQL/MariaDB: A backtick in queries is a delimiter for column, table, and database identifiers.
* OCaml: The backtick indicates polymorphic variants.
* Pico: The backtick indicates comments in the programming language.
* PowerShell: The backtick is used as the escape character. For example, a newline character is denoted codice_10. Most common programming languages use a backslash as the escape character (e.g., codice_11), but because Windows allows the backslash as a path separator, it is impractical for PowerShell to use backslash for a different purpose. Two backticks produce the codice_3 character itself. For example, the nullable boolean of .NET is specified in PowerShell as codice_13.
* Python: Prior to version 3.0, backticks were a synonym for the codice_14 function, which converts its argument to a string suitable for a programmer to view. However, this feature was removed in Python 3.0. Backticks also appear extensively in the reStructuredText plain text markup language (implemented in the Python docutils package).
* R: The backtick is used to surround non-syntactic variable names. This includes variable names containing special characters or reserved words, among others.
* Racket: The backtick or &quot;Quasiquote&quot; is used to begin creating lists.
* Scala: An identifier may also be formed by an arbitrary string between backticks. The identifier then is composed of all characters excluding the backticks themselves.
* Tom: The backtick creates a new term or to calls an existing term.
* Unlambda: The backtick character denotes function application.
* Verilog HDL: The backtick is used at the beginning of compiler&#x27;s directives.

== Games ==
In many PC-based computer games in the US and UK, the key is used to open the console so the user can execute script commands via its CLI. This is true for games such as &quot;Factorio&quot;, &quot;Battlefield 3&quot;, &quot;Half-Life&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, &quot;Blockland&quot;, &quot;Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix&quot;, &quot;Unreal&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, &quot;Crysis&quot;, &quot;Morrowind&quot;, &quot;Oblivion&quot;, &quot;Skyrim&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, &quot;RuneScape&quot;, and games based on the Quake engine or Source engine. 
While not necessarily the original progenitor of the console key concept, &quot;Quake&quot; is still widely associated with any usage of the key as a toggle for a drop-down console, often being referred to as the &quot;Quake Key&quot;. In 2021, Windows Terminal introduced a &quot;Quake Mode&quot; which enables a global shortcut of + that opens a terminal window pinned to the top half of the screen.

<doc id="559844" wikidata="Q68340" url="?curid=559844" title="Dunsinane Hill">
<text>Dunsinane Hill ( ) is a hill of the Sidlaws near the village of Collace in Perthshire, Scotland. It is mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, in which a vision informs Macbeth that he &quot;shall never vanquished be, until Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill Shall come against him.&quot;

The hill has a height of and commands expansive views of the surrounding countryside. It consists of a late Iron Age hill fort, the ramparts of which remain obvious. The site was damaged by undocumented amateur excavations in the 19th century by antiquarians attracted to the site by its Shakespearean connection. Little of value was learned about the history of the monument from these unscientific endeavours.

Dunsinane is the traditional site of a 1054 battle in which Siward, Earl of Northumbria defeated Macbeth of Scotland. The much earlier Iron Age hill fort has long been known as Macbeth&#x27;s Castle, though there is no archaeological evidence that it was in use by him or anyone during the mid eleventh century.

== Pronunciation and etymology ==

To facilitate the rhyme in the couplet &quot;I will not be afraid of death and bane, Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane&quot; the pronunciation usually employed for Shakespeare&#x27;s play has the accent on the first or third syllable, with a long &quot;a&quot; (i.e. or ). However, the correct pronunciation has the accent on the second syllable, with a short &quot;a&quot;.

An alternative spelling of the name is Dunsinnan. The derivation is Gaelic, &quot;the hill of ants&quot;; possibly a reference to the large number of people it took to build the fortress.

== Ascent ==

The best access to Dunsinane Hill is from the rear of the Perthshire village of Collace on the northern side of Dunsinane Hill, between the village and the quarry. There is a small parking area there suitable for 4 or 5 cars, from which a steep, but clearly defined path leads directly to the summit.

<doc id="559846" wikidata="Q744983" url="?curid=559846" title="Boza">
<text>Boza, also bosa, is a fermented beverage originating from Central Asia and made in parts of the Balkans, Turkey, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and North Africa. It is a malt drink made by fermenting various grains: maize (corn) and wheat in Turkey. It is one of the oldest Turkic beverages. It has a thick consistency, a low alcohol content (around 1%), and a slightly acidic sweet flavor.

== Etymology ==
According to Turkish etymological dictionary &quot;Nişanyan Sözlük&quot;, &quot;boza&quot; is etymologically Turkic in origin.
The dictionary states that Old Turkic &quot;buχsı&quot; or &quot;buχsum&quot; are cognates, yet it is unclear from which language it was ultimately derived and which one took it as a loanword. Ármin Vámbéry says it is an ancient Turkish word found in &quot;Kutadgu Bilig&quot;.

The oldest written account of the drink is under the name &quot;buχsum&quot; and is attested from the 1073 Middle Turkic dictionary &quot;Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk&quot; by Mahmud al-Kashgari. Modern Turkish word &quot;boza&quot; is believed to be cognates with the Old Turkic &quot;buχsı&quot; or &quot;buχsum&quot;. The drink under the name &quot;boza&quot; is first attested in Abu Hayyan al-Gharnati&#x27;s early 14th century Kipchak Turkic work &quot;Kitab al-&#x27;idrak li-lisan al-&#x27;atrak&quot; 

==History==
Fermented cereal flour (generally millet) drinks have been produced in Anatolia and Mesopotamia since the 9th or 8th millennia BCE, and Xenophon mentioned in the 4th century BCE how the locals preserved and cooled the preparations in earthen pots that were buried. There are references mentioning boza-like &quot;fermented (ground) millet drink&quot; in Akkadian and Sumerian texts; the beverage is said to be respectively &quot;arsikku&quot; and &quot;ar-zig&quot;. In the 10th century CE, the drink was called &quot;Boza&quot; and became common amongst Central Asian Turkic peoples. Later it spread to the Caucasus and the Balkans. It enjoyed its golden age under the Ottomans, and &quot;boza&quot;-making became a common trade in towns and cities.

Until the 16th century, boza was drunk freely everywhere, but the custom of making the so-called Tartar boza laced with opium brought the wrath of the authorities down on the drink, and it was prohibited by sultan Selim II (1566–1574). He describes a type of non-alcoholic sweet &quot;boza&quot; of a milk white color usually made by Albanians.

In the 17th century, Sultan Mehmed IV (1648–1687) prohibited alcoholic drinks including &quot;boza&quot;, and closed down all the &quot;boza&quot; shops. This prohibition would be reinforced and then loosened several times in the history of the empire. The 17th century Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi reports that &quot;boza&quot; was widely drunk at this time, and that there were 300 &quot;boza&quot; shops employing over a thousand people in Istanbul alone.

In this period, boza was widely drunk by the Janissaries in the army. It contained only a low level of alcohol, so as long as it was not consumed in sufficient quantities to cause drunkenness, it was tolerated as a warming and strengthening beverage for soldiers. As Evliya Çelebi explained in the first volume (&quot;Istanbul&quot;) of his &quot;Seyahatname&quot; (Travelogues), &quot;These &quot;boza&quot; makers are numerous in the army. To drink sufficient &quot;boza&quot; to cause intoxication is sinful but, unlike wine, in small quantities it is not condemned.&quot; In the 19th century, the sweet and non-alcoholic &quot;boza&quot; preferred at the Ottoman palace became increasingly popular, while the sour and alcoholic type of boza went out of style. In 1876, brothers Haci Ibrahim and Haci Sadik established a boza shop in the Istanbul district of Vefa, close to the then center of entertainment, Direklerarası. This &quot;boza&quot;, with its thick consistency and tart flavor, became famous throughout the city. It is the only &quot;boza&quot; shop dating from that period still in business today, and is now run by the founders&#x27; great-great-grandchildren.

In the 1910s, boza also reached Białystok in Poland, where it was introduced by Macedonian immigrants, and is now designated a local traditional beverage by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland.
==Production and storage==
Boza is produced in the Balkans, notably Bulgaria and most of the Turkic regions, but not always using millet. The flavour varies according to the cereal which is used. Measuring boza samples made from maize, wheat, and rice flours, researchers determined an average of 12.3% total sugar, 1.06% protein, and 0.07% fat. The boza in Białystok, Poland is made from millet groats, with the addition of raisins, lemon and sugar.

Boza spoils if not kept in a cool place, therefore boza fermenters in Turkey did not sell boza during the hot summer traditionally, instead selling alternative beverages such as grape juice or lemonade. They produce it in the summer now due to increased availability of refrigeration, and revenue from high demand. Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Bulgaria, Albania, and North Macedonia produce boza as a refreshing beverage year-round.

==In popular culture==
* Mevlut Karataş, the main character in Orhan Pamuk&#x27;s 2014 novel &quot;A Strangeness in My Mind&quot; (&quot;Kafamda Bir Tuhaflık&quot;), is a boza vendor.
* The Serbian band Zana mentions boza in the title track from their album &quot;Nisam, nisam&quot;.
* A popular drink in Bulgaria, usually accompanied by a Banitsa or Gevrek

Honorably discharged Army Ranger Cameron Poe returns home from Desert Storm to his hometown of Mobile, Alabama, and reunites with his pregnant wife Tricia. That night, three intoxicated men assault Poe, who ends up being given a seven to ten-year prison sentence for accidentally killing one of them in self-defense. Eight years later, Poe is paroled and boards a flight to Alabama on the &quot;Jailbird&quot;, a converted JPATS prison transport plane. Accompanying Poe is his diabetic cellmate and best friend Mike &quot;Baby-O&quot; O&#x27;Dell.

Most of the inmates boarding the flight are high-risk convicts being transferred to a supermax prison, including mass murderer William &quot;Billy Bedlam&quot; Bedford, serial rapist John &quot;Johnny 23&quot; Baca, Black Guerrilla former general Nathan &quot;Diamond Dog&quot; Jones, and professional criminal Cyrus &quot;The Virus&quot; Grissom. The flight is overseen by U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin. DEA agent Willie Sims plans to go on an undercover mission to get information from drug kingpin Francisco Cindino, who is being picked up en-route.

After taking off, inmate Joe &quot;Pinball&quot; Parker sets another prisoner on fire using smuggled kerosene as a distraction, allowing Grissom and Diamond Dog to take over the plane. They plan to land at Carson Airport as scheduled, pick up and transfer other prisoners and fly to a non-extradition country. Sims tries to retake control, but Grissom kills him and takes his gun.

The plane arrives at Carson City and the inmates exchange commences. The ground crew is unaware that hijackers are disguised as guards and the real guards are forcibly disguised as inmates, gagged to prevent them from revealing the scheme. Amongst the new passengers are Cindino, pilot Earl &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; Williams and serial killer Garland Greene. The authorities discover the hijacking upon finding evidence in Grissom&#x27;s old cell and a tape recorder planted by Poe on one of the disguised guards but cannot prevent the plane from taking off. Meanwhile, Pinball disposes of the plane&#x27;s transponder, but dies trying to reboard during takeoff.

The inmates agree to land at Lerner Airfield, a desert airstrip, and transfer onto another plane owned by Cindino and his cartel. Poe finds Pinball&#x27;s corpse trapped in the landing gear and writes a message to Larkin on the body before throwing it out. Larkin learns of the news and heads to Lerner after contacting the National Guard. Bedford, raiding the cargo, discovers Poe&#x27;s identity when reading his parole letter and finding the stuffed rabbit Poe intends to give to his daughter Casey, forcing Poe to kill him.

The &quot;Jailbird&quot; is grounded at Lerner, with no sign of the transfer aircraft. Poe warns the others of Cindino&#x27;s past acts of deceit and betrayal; Grissom orders the others to fuel up the plane and get it ready for takeoff. Poe leaves to find Baby-O a syringe to give him insulin, meeting Larkin and informing him of the situation. They discover Cindino planning to escape on a hidden private jet, which Larkin sabotages by lowering a crane arm onto it. Grissom executes Cindino by igniting the plane&#x27;s fuel. Johnny 23 spots a National Guard convoy approaching and gives the alarm. The inmates find an arsenal of shotguns and rifles in the cargo hold and prepare an ambush. As the National Guard arrives, the inmates launch an assault, resulting in various casualties, but Larkin defends the surviving troops using a bulldozer as a makeshift shield, while the surviving inmates return to the &quot;Jailbird&quot; and take flight.

Poe&#x27;s identity is revealed when Bedford&#x27;s body is found. Baby-O takes the blame and is shot by Grissom, when Larkin and Sims&#x27; partner, Duncan Malloy, arrive in attack helicopters, damaging the &quot;Jailbird&quot;″s fuel tank. Poe takes command of the cockpit, and Larkin instructs him to have the plane land at McCarran International Airport, but Swamp Thing is forced to land it on the Las Vegas Strip, causing mass destruction and killing Johnny 23. Grissom, Diamond Dog and Swamp Thing escape on a fire truck, pursued by Poe and Larkin on police motorcycles; the chase results in the deaths of all three escapees. Poe reunites with his family, meeting Casey for the first time and giving her the bunny. As the surviving inmates are apprehended, Greene, the only one unaccounted for, is seen gambling in a casino.

==Production==

With second unit work beginning on June 24, 1996, principal photography began shortly after in Salt Lake City, on July 1, 1996 and continued until October 29, 1996, at a number of locations. While most of the interiors of the Fairchild C-123 Provider transport aircraft were filmed in Hollywood Center Studios soundstage #7, Wendover Airport in Utah, as the stand in for the fictional Lerner Airfield, was used for the C-123 flying and taxi scenes. Director Simon West chose the barren and remote Wendover area &quot;because it looked like the surface of the moon ... My idea was that it was perfect for the convicts who had been locked up for 10, 20, 30 years in little cells.&quot; The old wartime bomber base was also used for the aircraft boneyard scenes while the original swimming pool at the base was used in a scene where Garland Greene was talking to a young girl.

On August 29, 1996, Phillip Swartz, a welder employed by Special Effects Unlimited, a Los Angeles-based firm, was crushed to death at Wendover when a static model of the C-123 used in the film fell on him. The film credits end with &quot;In Memory of Phil Swartz&quot;.

Other filming locations included Ogden Airport where the exchange of prisoners is seen. The scene where the aircraft&#x27;s left wing hits the Fender Stratocaster sign of Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (which later played host to the film&#x27;s premiere), was filmed using a replicated guitar sign and a &quot;Jailbird&quot; miniature model. The crash site was filmed in the Sands Hotel before its demolition on November 26, 1996. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer found the right spot for the climactic finale, originally planned for a crash at the White House, but Las Vegas was more in keeping with the theme and visual pun of convicts &quot;cashing in&quot;. &quot;We got very lucky ... The Sands was going to be demolished anyway. They blew up the tower on their own. We arranged to blow up the front of the building.&quot; The 2nd Street Tunnel in Los Angeles was also used for the tunnel chase scene near the end of the film.

Three C-123&#x27;s were used during production and were painted with the &quot;Jailbird&quot; livery. The actual flying C-123 model used during flight scenes in the film had a series of both military and private owners. In December 2003 it was sold to All West Freight Inc. in Delta Junction, Alaska. On August 1, 2010, the C-123 was destroyed when it crashed into Mount Healy within Denali National Park in Alaska. The three member flight crew was killed in the crash. Another C-123, formerly registered as N94DT, was used for the crash scene in Las Vegas and then scrapped following production. The third &quot;Jailbird&quot; movie model used for the taxi scenes was later donated by the filmmakers to the Historic Wendover Airfield Foundation, where it remains on display at the ramp as an attraction for visitors.

The film used several highly detailed models at 1/15th scale, and a multitude of military and private aircraft assembled for the desert boneyard scene.

==Music==

The film featured the Diane Warren–penned LeAnn Rimes hit single &quot;How Do I Live&quot;, performed by Trisha Yearwood for the film.

The &quot;Con Air&quot; soundtrack album omits two songs featured in the film: &quot;How Do I Live&quot;, written by Diane Warren and performed by Trisha Yearwood and &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Although a key element of the film, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; noted, &quot;The soundtrack kicks into loud, obtrusive gear ... [and] remains so loud throughout the picture that it practically functions as a distancing device.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Con Air&quot; opened June 6, 1997 on 2,824 screens in the United States and Canada and grossed $24.1 million in its opening weekend, topping the US box office above &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. For its second weekend, the film dropped into second place behind &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;, but still made $15.7 million. It also opened in the UK, Hong Kong, Israel and parts of Latin America, including Brazil and Mexico grossing $5 million for the weekend, for a total worldwide opening of $29 million. In the US and Canada, it grossed $15.7 million in its second weekend and $10.4 million in its third, finishing second and third, respectively.

The film grossed $101.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $122.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $224 million.

===Critical response===
According to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 58% of 71 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Con Air&quot; won&#x27;t win any awards for believability – and all involved seem cheerfully aware of it, making some of this blockbuster action outing&#x27;s biggest flaws fairly easy to forgive.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert, reviewing the film for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, awarded it three out of four stars, saying it &quot;moves smoothly and with visual style and verbal wit.&quot; Janet Maslin, reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered &quot;Con Air&quot; an exemplar of the &quot;thrill ride genre&quot;. In contrast, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Peter Travers decried the &quot;flip, hip&quot; and ultimately, &quot;depressing ... pandering&quot; present in the treatment.

Andrew Johnston, reviewer for &quot;Time Out New York&quot;, stated: &quot;Leaving &quot;The Rock&quot; last summer, I thought it seemed physically impossible for a more over-the-top action movie to be made. That was pretty short-sighted of me, since it was only a matter of time until producer Jerry Bruckheimer topped himself as he does with the wildly entertaining &quot;Con Air&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Maxim&quot; put the film&#x27;s climactic Las Vegas plane crash at the top of their 2007 list of &quot;The Top Ten Most Horrific Movie Plane Crashes&quot;, a decision that was derided by &quot;Wired&quot;.

<text>Dame Mary Louise Webster, (née Whitty; 19 June 1865 – 29 May 1948), known professionally as May Whitty and later, for her charity work, Dame May Whitty, was an English stage and film actress. She was one of the first two women entertainers to become a Dame. The British actors&#x27; union Equity was established in her home in 1930. 

Her film roles included Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s thriller &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938) in which she played Miss Froy, a British spy posing as a governess who disappears on a train. After a successful career both on the West End stage and in British films, she moved over to Hollywood films at the age of 72.

==Background==
Whitty was born in Liverpool, England, to William Alfred Whitty (circa 1837–1876), a newspaper proprietor, and Mary Louisa (née Ashton, circa 1837–1894). Her grandfather was Michael James Whitty, Chief Constable in Liverpool and founder of the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot;. She made her first stage appearance in Liverpool in 1881, later moving to London to appear in the West End. 

She married the actor-manager Ben Webster on 3 August 1892 in St Giles&#x27;s Parish Church, London. In 1895 they visited the United States, where Whitty appeared on Broadway. Their first child, a son, died at birth. Their only surviving child, a daughter born in New York in 1905, Margaret Webster, was a producer who held dual US and UK citizenship. She was chair of the Actresses&#x27; Franchise League (AFL).

Whitty&#x27;s stage career continued for the rest of her life. In March 1910, she made her transition to middle-aged and elderly character roles, playing Amelia Madras in Harley Granville-Barker&#x27;s four-act comedy &quot;The Madras House&quot;. During World War I she was active in the AFL, working there to help organize the Women&#x27;s Emergency Corps. In March 1922, she played the role of Mrs. Bennet before the Queen in a benefit performance of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. She acted opposite her husband, who played Mr. Darcy.

==Honours ==
In the 1918 New Year Honours, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE, gazetted under her legal married name Mary Louise Webster) in recognition of her charitable work during the First World War for the Three Arts Women&#x27;s Employment Fund and the British Women&#x27;s Hospitals Committee. She was the first stage and film actress to receive a damehood, along with the opera singer Nellie Melba, who was also thus honoured in 1918.

==Film career and death==
Whitty made her Hollywood film debut at the age of 72, recreating her 1935 stage role in the Hollywood film &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1937), which also starred Robert Montgomery and Rosalind Russell. She received an Oscar nomination. This led to several supporting roles in films, including that of the vanishing lady, Miss Froy, in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938).

In 1939, Whitty permanently moved to the United States - although she never became a US citizen; and appeared both on stage and in Hollywood films, usually playing wealthy dowagers. It was one such part, as Lady Beldon in &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942), that brought her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.

She continued to act for the remainder of her life, and died on 29 May 1948 in Beverly Hills, California, from cancer at the age of 82; her husband had died the previous year during surgery. She is commemorated with a plaque at St Paul&#x27;s parish church in Covent Garden, London, alongside the plaque to her husband.
