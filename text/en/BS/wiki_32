<text>In biology, an effector is a general term that can refer to several types of molecules or cells. In the context of biological system regulation, an effector is an element of a regulation loop controlling a regulated quantity.

Small molecule effectors

* A small molecule that selectively binds to a protein to regulate its biological activity can be called an effector. In this manner, effector molecules act as ligands that can increase or decrease enzyme activity, gene expression, influence cell signaling, or other protein functions. An example of such an effector is oxygen, which is an allosteric effector of hemoglobin - oxygen binding to one of the four hemoglobin subunits greatly increases the affinity of the rest of the subunits to oxygen. Certain drug molecules also fall into this category - for example the antibiotic rifampicin used in the treatment of tuberculosis binds the initiation σ factor subunit of the bacterial RNA polymerase, preventing the transcription of bacterial genes.
* The term can also be used to describe small molecules that can directly bind to and regulate the expression of mRNAs. One example for such an effector is guanine, which can be recognised by specific sequences (known as riboswitches) found on mRNAs, and its binding to those sequences prevents the translation of the mRNA into a protein. See also: purine riboswitch.

Protein effectors

* An effector can also be used to refer to a protein that is involved in cellular signal transduction cascades. Such an example are RAS effector proteins, which are all able to bind RAS.GTP, but trigger different cell pathways upon doing so - such as the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, the PI3K pathway or several others.
* An effector hormone is a hormone that acts on a particular tissue - an example of such a hormone is thyroxine (T4), which regulates metabolism in many tissues throughout the body.
* Antibody Effectors are effectors involved with the production and secretion of molecules involved in pathogen defense, such as Immunoglobulin. Many antibodies then act as effector molecules for the immune system of the organism.
* [[Bacterial effector protein]]s are proteins injected by (usually pathogenic) bacterial cells into the cells of their host. The injected proteins serve different functions dependent on the bacteria of origin, but typically serve the purpose of inhibiting the host cells immune response. An example of these are the Transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins secreted by bacteria from the genus &quot;Xanthomonas&quot;.
* [[Fungal effectors]] are secreted by pathogenic or beneficial fungi into and around host cells by invasive hyphae to disable defense components or facilitate colonization. Protein secretion systems in fungi involve the Spitzenkörper.

RNA effectors

* Certain plant pathogens, such as &quot;Botrytis cinerea,&quot; secrete small RNAs (sRNAs) into the host cells and downregulate plant proteins involved in the immune response by RNA interference.

Effector cells

* In immunology, effector cells are cells of either the innate or the adaptive immune system that mediate the immune response.
* Effector neurons can be used to refer to population of neurons in the nervous system, which are responsible for a certain brain function. An example are the neurons in the mesopontine tegmental anesthesia area (MPTA) of the brainstem, which have been mapped as the region of the brain that is responsive to anaesthetics in a rodent model.

==Types==
* Enzyme activator
* Enzyme inhibitor

<text>The Brioni Agreement, also known as the Brioni Declaration (, , , , ) is a document signed by representatives of Slovenia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia under the political sponsorship of the European Community (EC) on the Brijuni Islands on 7 July 1991. The agreement sought to create an environment in which further negotiations on the future of Yugoslavia could take place. However, ultimately it isolated the federal prime minister Ante Marković in his efforts to preserve Yugoslavia, and effectively stopped any form of federal influence over Slovenia. This meant the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) would focus on combat in Croatia, creating a precedent of redrawing international borders and staking the EC&#x27;s interest in resolving the Yugoslav crisis.

The agreement put an end to hostilities between the Yugoslav and Slovene forces in the Ten-Day War. Slovenia and Croatia agreed to suspend activities stemming from their 25 June declarations of independence for a period of three months. The document also resolved border control and customs inspection issues regarding Slovenia&#x27;s borders, resolved air-traffic control responsibility and mandated an exchange of prisoners of war. The Brioni Agreement also formed the basis for an observer mission to monitor implementation of the agreement in Slovenia. Eleven days after the agreement was made, the federal government pulled the JNA out of Slovenia. Conversely, the agreement made no mitigating impact on fighting in Croatia.

==Background==
On 23 June 1991, as Slovenia and Croatia prepared to declare their independence during the breakup of Yugoslavia, the European Community (EC) foreign ministers decided the EC member states would not extend diplomatic recognition to the two states. The EC viewed the declarations as unilateral moves and offered assistance in negotiations regarding the future of the SFR Yugoslavia instead. At the same time, the EC decided to suspend direct talks with Slovenia and Croatia. The move was welcomed by the Yugoslav federal government. Slovenia and Croatia declared independence on 25 June, and the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) units began to deploy from its bases in Slovenia the next day. On 27 June, armed conflict broke out as the JNA and the Territorial Defence Force of Slovenia (TDS) began fighting over control of Slovenia&#x27;s border posts, in what became the Ten-Day War.

A three-strong EC delegation made three visits to the region in late June and early July to negotiate a political agreement which would facilitate further negotiations. The delegation consisted of the foreign ministers of Luxembourg, as the incumbent holder of the EC presidency, and Italy and the Netherlands, as the previous and future holders of that office. The delegation members were Jacques Poos (Luxembourg), Gianni de Michelis (Italy), and Hans van den Broek (Netherlands). Prior to the delegation&#x27;s arrival in Belgrade, Poos told reporters that the EC would take charge of the crisis. There, the delegation was met by Serbian president Slobodan Milošević who dismissed the prospect of Croatia leaving the Yugoslav federation because its population contained 600,000 Serbs.

On 29 June, Croatia and Slovenia agreed to suspend their declarations of independence to allow time for a negotiated settlement. The EC delegation appeared to make progress when Serbia responded to the move by ceasing their opposition to the appointment of a Croatian member of the federal presidency, Stjepan Mesić, as President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia on 30 June. The appearance of a success was reinforced when the JNA ordered its troops posted in Slovenia to return to their barracks. On 1 July, de Michelis was replaced by João de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister, to maintain the formula of current, former and future EC presidencies comprising the EC delegation as the Netherlands took over the presidency from Luxembourg, while Portugal was scheduled to assume the presidency after the Dutch.

==Conference at Brijuni==

A further result of the EC delegation&#x27;s mission were talks attended by representatives of the EC, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia and the Yugoslav government. The talks were held at Brijuni Islands on 7 July. Besides the EC delegation, headed by van den Broek, five out of eight members of the federal presidency attended the talks—Mesić, Bogić Bogićević, Janez Drnovšek, Branko Kostić and Vasil Tupurkovski. The Yugoslav federal prime minister Ante Marković was also present, as were the Yugoslav federal foreign minister Budimir Lončar, interior minister Petar Gračanin and the deputy defence minister Vice Admiral . Croatia was represented by President Franjo Tuđman while President Milan Kučan attended on behalf of Slovenia. Serbia was represented by Borisav Jović, a former Serbian member of the federal presidency who had resigned from the position on 15 June, instead of Milošević who refused to attend. Starting at 8:00 a.m., the EC delegation held separate talks with Kučan and his assistants, then with Tuđman and his assistants, and finally with Jović. In the afternoon, a plenary meeting was held with the federal, Slovene and Croatian delegations in attendance, while Jović reportedly left dissatisfied with the talks.

The agreement was prepared at the EC council of ministers in The Hague on 5 July. It consisted of a Joint Declaration, and two annexes detailing the creation of an environment suitable to further political negotiations and guidelines for an observer mission to Yugoslavia. The agreement, which became known as the Brioni Declaration or the Brioni Agreement, required the JNA and the TDS to return to their bases, and stipulated that Slovene officials were to control Slovenia&#x27;s borders alone and that both Slovenia and Croatia were to suspend all activities stemming from their declarations of independence for three months. The observer mission set out by the Brioni Agreement materialised as the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) tasked with monitoring the disengagement of the JNA and the TDS in Slovenia, and ultimately the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia.

==Aftermath==
Even though little was agreed upon and the agreement was later interpreted differently by its signatories, the Brioni Agreement established the EC&#x27;s interest in the region and the first EC Ministerial Conference on Yugoslavia was held in The Hague on 10 July. The ECMM helped calm several standoffs around military barracks in Slovenia and facilitated negotiations between Slovene authorities and the JNA regarding the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia. In Croatia, armed combat continued and the JNA shelled the city of Osijek the same evening the agreement was signed. The federal presidency ordered the complete withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia on 18 July in response to Slovene actions in breach of the Brioni Agreement. The ECMM&#x27;s scope of work was expanded to include Croatia on 1 September. By mid-September, the war had escalated as the Croatian National Guard and police blockaded the JNA barracks and the JNA embarked on a campaign against Croatian forces.

The Brioni Agreement isolated Marković who tried to preserve the federation, but was ignored by van den Broek who appeared not to comprehend issues presented before him, and the EC delegation tacitly encouraged the dissolution of Yugoslavia. The agreement diminished the authority of part of the JNA&#x27;s leadership who fought for the preservation of the Yugoslav federation. The agreement was also unfavourable for Croatia because it was left to defend against the JNA and Serb forces. By effectively removing Slovenia from influence of the federal authorities, especially the JNA, the agreement fulfilled one of the Serbian nationalists&#x27; goals, allowing the redrawing of international borders. Sabrina Ramet noted that Kučan and Milošević reached an agreement in January 1991 in which Milošević gave his assurances that Slovenia&#x27;s independence bid would not be opposed by Serbia. In return, Kučan expressed his understanding for Milošević&#x27;s interest to create a Greater Serbia.

At the time, the EC viewed the agreement as a method of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation&#x27;s failure to respond to Jović&#x27;s departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers&#x27; declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts had little to do with the situation on the ground.

<text>Bow Road () is a London Underground station located on Bow Road in Bow, London, England. It is on the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines. The station is interlinked as an out of station interchange (OSI) with Bow Church station on the Docklands Light Railway which is about away via Bow Road. The two stations are classed as a single station for ticketing purposes as well as on tube maps but both are managed separately.

==Location==
The station is situated on the road that reflects its own name, while a fire exit leads to Wellington Way. National rail c2c tracks and Mornington Grove road cross above the District line to the east of the platforms. Nearby landmarks include the Minnie Lansbury Memorial, Phoenix Primary and Secondary School, Thames Magistrates&#x27; Court, Bow Road police station and Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park. The station serves a medium-sized population, as part of its catchment overlaps Mile End station.

==History==
The station was opened on 11 June 1902 by the Whitechapel and Bow Railway (which was later incorporated into the District line), with the Hammersmith &amp; City line (then the Metropolitan line) following in 1936.

The Great Eastern Railway Bow Road railway station, which closed in 1949, stood on the opposite side of Bow Road.

Ownership of the station passed to London Underground in 1950.

==Design and layout==

The station building is Grade II listed since 27 September 1973. Red bricks form the exterior facade, featuring stone eaves cornice and brick blocking course. The structure is topped with a slate roof, and has round arched doors. The doors are finished with fanlights, with four windows arranged alternately. An enclosed footbridge hangs across the platforms sheltered with canopies, both of which are made of wood. The canopies are barrel-vaulted, supported by cast iron beams and wall brackets, and hexagonal cast iron pillars. The pillars are arranged in line, following the curvature of the platforms. There are 12 pillars on one platform, while the other has 14.
Bow Road station has two platforms, and marks the point where westbound trains from Upminster and Barking enter a tunnel; the gradient of the tunnel approach, which is to the east of the station, is 1 in 28, the steepest on the tube network. The station platforms are below street level, where the western end of the platforms is in tunnel while the eastern end is in an open cutting. Other stations on the District Line are designed in a similar way, such as High Street Kensington and Sloane Square.

==Services and connections==

Bow Road is served by both the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, between Mile End and Bromley-by-Bow stations, in Travelcard Zone 2. Off-peak services on the District line generally run between Richmond or Ealing Broadway to Upminster. During peak hours, trains also operate to Wimbledon. The typical off-peak services, in trains per hour (tph) are:
*District line:
**12 tph eastbound to Upminster
**6 tph westbound to Richmond
**6 tph westbound Ealing Broadway
*Hammersmith &amp; City line:
**6 tph eastbound to Barking
**6 tph westbound to Hammersmith

London Buses services routes 25 and 205, local route 425, and night route N25 and N205 serve the station.

Bow Road is connected eastwards via the thoroughfare of the same name to Bow Church station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) as an out of station interchange (OSI); they are classed as a single station for ticketing purposes but managed as separate stations.

<text>Florian Cajori (February 28, 1859 – August 14 or 15, 1930) was a Swiss-American historian of mathematics.

==Biography==
Florian Cajori was born in Zillis, Switzerland, as the son of Georg Cajori and Catherine Camenisch. He attended schools first in Zillis and later in Chur. In 1875, Florian Cajori emigrated to the United States at the age of sixteen, and attended the State Normal school in Whitewater, Wisconsin. After graduating in 1878, he taught in a country school, and later began studying mathematics at University of Wisconsin–Madison.

In 1883, Cajori received both his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, briefly attended Johns Hopkins University for 8 months in between degrees. He taught for a few years at Tulane University, before being appointed as professor of applied mathematics there in 1887. He was then driven north by tuberculosis. He founded the Colorado College Scientific Society and taught at Colorado College where he held the chair in physics from 1889 to 1898 and the chair in mathematics from 1898 to 1918. He was the position Dean of the engineering department. While at Colorado, he received his doctorate from Tulane in 1894, and married Elizabeth G. Edwards in 1890 and had one son.

Cajori&#x27;s &quot;A History of Mathematics&quot; (1894) was the first popular presentation of the history of mathematics in the United States. Based upon his reputation in the history of mathematics (even today his 1928–1929 &quot;History of Mathematical Notations&quot; has been described as &quot;unsurpassed&quot;) he was appointed in 1918 to the first history of mathematics chair in the U.S, created especially for him, at the University of California, Berkeley. He remained in Berkeley, California until his death in 1930. Cajori did no original mathematical research unrelated to the history of mathematics. In addition to his numerous books, he also contributed highly recognized and popular historical articles to the &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot;. His last work was a revision of Andrew Motte&#x27;s 1729 translation of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;, vol.1 The Motion of Bodies, but he died before it was completed. The work was finished by R.T. Crawford of Berkeley, California.

<text>Bromley-by-Bow () is a London Underground station located on the Blackwall Tunnel Northern Approach Road in the Bromley-by-Bow area of London, United Kingdom. It is below the Blackwall Tunnel Northern Approach Road. The station is on the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines between Bow Road and West Ham stations, and is in both Travelcard Zones 2 and 3.

==History==
It was opened as a railway station called Bromley by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LTSR) in 1858, on its new line to Barking from the terminus at Fenchurch Street, a more direct route than the route hitherto used. On 17 May 1869 a spur opened from Bow railway station on the North London Railway line to Bromley Junction, just to the west of the station. A shuttle service operated between Bow and Plaistow until wartime economies saw the service withdrawn on 1 January 1915. The main reason for building this spur was however for freight use.

Increasing use of the station to catch services provided by the LTSR, the NLR and Great Eastern Railway (GER)—which ran services from Fenchurch Street to North Woolwich—saw plans drawn up in 1892 to construct a new station. A fire on 20 December of that year saw these plans brought forward and work was started early in 1893. Bromley Junction was moved west to accommodate this work and a new 36 lever signal box was opened with the re-sited junction on 1 October 1893.
The new station to the west of St. Leonards Street (now Blackwall Tunnel Northern Approach) was opened on 1 March 1894 and the old station on the other side of the bridge was closed.

In 1898 the goods yard was opened on the south side of the line and to the east of the station.

The construction of the Whitechapel and Bow Railway allowed the District Railway (now known as the District line) to start serving the station in 1902, and initially steam services operated through to East Ham with some operating as far as Upminster. The District Line joined the main line at Campbell Road Junction also to the west of the station (and Bromley Junction). Electrification of the system followed in 1905. Delayed by World War I, electrified tracks were extended by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) to Upminster and through services fully resumed in 1932.
Congestion of the railway through Bromley saw additional tracks provided in 1905. Two new Local Lines (which were the new electrified lines) were added on the north side of the station along with two new platform faces and improved passenger facilities. The new lines, which stretched as far as Abbey Mills Junction (where the North Woolwich trains diverged from the main line), opened on 1 August 1905.

In 1912 the LTSR was taken over by the Midland Railway, although on 1 January 1923 this was grouped into the London Midland &amp; Scottish Railway. In 1927 the local lines were re-signalled with colour light signalling.

The District Railway was incorporated into London Transport in 1933, and became known as the District line. The Hammersmith &amp; City line (then part of the Metropolitan line) started operating services through Bromley on 4 May 1936. The 1947 timetable shows only a few services a day provided by the LMS and a frequent service provided by the District and a peak hours service of the Metropolitan line (now part of the Hammersmith &amp; City line). After nationalisation of the railways in 1948 management of the station passed to British Railways London Midland region although it was then transferred to the Eastern Region on 20 February 1949. The remaining Fenchurch Street–Southend services were withdrawn in 1962 when the main lines were electrified with 25 kV overhead lines.

On 13 September 1959 the spur between Bromley and Bow (NLR) was closed and three years later in 1962, the goods yard closed. The station was renamed to Bromley-by-Bow in 1967, to prevent confusion with Bromley station in the London Borough of Bromley. The continued management of the station by an organisation now providing none of the services became more of an anomaly and in 1969 ownership transferred to the London Underground which came under the authority of the London Transport Executive of the Greater London Council. Another fire in February 1970 led to the demolition of the station buildings (dating from 1894) and a newer booking office opened on 11 June 1972. having been constructed by British Rail.

===Bomb discovery===
On 2 June 2008, an unexploded bomb from World War II was found near where the line crosses the Prescott Channel, not far from the station, causing disruption to trains.

==Design==
The station entrance is at a higher level than the platforms (being situated on the road bridge crossing the rail tracks) which are accessible by stairs and lifts. There are no escalators. The station has four platforms, of which only two are currently in use; serving the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, which share a track at this point, in both directions. The remaining two platforms formerly served the London, Tilbury and Southend line (now operated by c2c). Three ticket barriers and a gate control access to all platforms.

In 2018, lifts were installed at the station, the 73rd on the Underground to gain step-free access. All these upgrades were funded by Transport for London in partnership with Tower Hamlets and London Legacy Development Corporation.

==Services==

===Hammersmith &amp; City line===
On the Hammersmith &amp; City line, Bromley-by-Bow station is between Bow Road to the west and West Ham to the east, as well on the District line. The typical off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:

*6 tph eastbound to Barking
*6 tph westbound to Hammersmith via King&#x27;s Cross and Wood Lane

===District line===

On the District line, Bromley-by-Bow station is between Bow Road to the west and West Ham to the east, as well on the Hammersmith &amp; City line. This is the typical off-peak service frequency. During peak times trains also operate to Wimbledon. During off-peak times, 3 trains per hour from Wimbledon terminate at Barking (as of December 2014).

*12 tph eastbound to (On Sundays alternate trains run to Barking only)
*3 tph eastbound to Barking
*6 tph westbound to Ealing Broadway
*6 tph westbound to Richmond
*3 tph westbound to Wimbledon

==Connections==
London Buses routes 323, 488 and D8 serve the station.

==In popular culture==
In the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, the fictional Walford East Underground station takes the place of Bromley-by-Bow.

<doc id="542744" wikidata="Q903485" url="?curid=542744" title="Protein purification">
<text>Protein purification is a series of processes intended to isolate one or a few proteins from a complex mixture, usually cells, tissues, or whole organisms. Protein purification is vital for the specification of the function, structure, and interactions of the protein of interest. The purification process may separate the protein and non-protein parts of the mixture, and finally separate the desired protein from all other proteins. Ideally, to study a protein of interest, it must be separated from other components of the cell so that contaminants will not interfere in the examination of the protein of interest&#x27;s structure and function. Separation of one protein from all others is typically the most laborious aspect of protein purification. Separation steps usually exploit differences in protein size, physico-chemical properties, binding affinity, and biological activity. The pure result may be termed protein isolate.

== Purpose ==
The protein manufacturing cost remains high and there is a growing demand to develop cost efficient and rapid protein purification methods. Understanding the different protein purification methods and optimizing the downstream processing is critical to minimize production costs while maintaining the quality of acceptable standards of homogeneity. Protein purification is either &quot;preparative&quot; or &quot;analytical&quot;. Preparative purifications aim to produce a relatively large quantity of purified proteins for subsequent use. Examples include the preparation of commercial products such as enzymes (e.g. lactase), nutritional proteins (e.g. soy protein isolate), and certain biopharmaceuticals (e.g. insulin). Several preparative purification steps are often deployed to remove bi-products, such as host cell proteins, which pose a potential threat to the patient&#x27;s health. Analytical purification produces a relatively small amount of a protein for a variety of research or analytical purposes, including identification, quantification, and studies of the protein&#x27;s structure, post-translational modifications, and function. Each step of a protein purification scheme is monitored and takes into consideration purification levels and yield. A high purification level and a poor yield leaves hardly any protein with which to experiment. On the other hand, a high yield with low purification levels leaves many contaminants (proteins other than the one interest) which interfere with research purposes.
==Preliminary steps==

=== Extraction ===
If the protein of interest is not secreted by the organism into the surrounding solution, the first step of each purification process is the disruption of the cells containing the protein. Depending on how fragile the protein is and how stable the cells are, one could, for instance, use one of the following methods: i) repeated freezing and thawing, ii) sonication, iii) homogenization by high pressure (French press), iv) homogenization by grinding (bead mill), and v) permeabilization by detergents (e.g. Triton X-100) and/or enzymes (e.g. lysozyme). Finally, the cell debris can be removed by differential centrifugation, which is a procedure where the homogenate is centrifuged at low speed, then again at a greater force to yield a pellet consisting of nuclei and supernatant. This yields several fractions of decreasing density where more discriminating purification techniques are applied to one fraction.

Also, proteases are released during cell lysis, which will start digesting the proteins in the solution. If the protein of interest is sensitive to proteolysis, it is recommended to proceed quickly, and to keep the extract cooled, to slow down the digestion. Alternatively, one or more protease inhibitors can be added to the lysis buffer immediately before cell disruption. Sometimes it is also necessary to add DNAse in order to reduce the viscosity of the cell lysate caused by a high DNA content.

=== Ultracentrifugation ===
Centrifugation is a process that uses centrifugal force to separate mixtures of particles of varying masses or densities suspended in a liquid. When a vessel (typically a tube or bottle) containing a mixture of proteins or other particulate matter, such as bacterial cells, is rotated at high speeds, the inertia of each particle yields a force in the direction of the particles velocity that is proportional to its mass. The tendency of a given particle to move through the liquid because of this force is offset by the resistance the liquid exerts on the particle. The net effect of &quot;spinning&quot; the sample in a centrifuge is that massive, small, and dense particles move outward faster than less massive particles or particles with more &quot;drag&quot; in the liquid. When suspensions of particles are &quot;spun&quot; in a centrifuge, a &quot;pellet&quot; may form at the bottom of the vessel that is enriched for the most massive particles with low drag in the liquid.

Non-compacted particles remain mostly in the liquid called &quot;supernatant&quot; and can be removed from the vessel thereby separating the supernatant from the pellet. The rate of centrifugation is determined by the angular acceleration applied to the sample, typically measured in comparison to the g-force. If samples are centrifuged long enough, the particles in the vessel will reach equilibrium wherein the particles accumulate specifically at a point in the vessel where their buoyant density is balanced with centrifugal force. Such an &quot;equilibrium&quot; centrifugation can allow extensive purification of a given particle.

Sucrose gradient centrifugation—a linear concentration gradient of sugar (typically sucrose, glycerol, or a silica-based density gradient media, like Percoll)—is generated in a tube such that the highest concentration is on the bottom and lowest on top. A protein sample is then layered on top of the gradient and spun at high speeds in an ultracentrifuge. This causes heavy macromolecules to migrate towards the bottom of the tube faster than lighter material. During centrifugation in the absence of sucrose, as particles move farther and farther from the center of rotation, they experience more and more centrifugal force (the further they move, the faster they move). The problem with this is that the useful separation range within the vessel is restricted to a small observable window. Spinning a sample twice as long does not mean the particle of interest will go twice as far; in fact, it will go significantly further. However, when the proteins are moving through a sucrose gradient, they encounter liquid of increasing density and viscosity. A properly designed sucrose gradient will counteract the increasing centrifugal force so the particles move in close proportion to the time they have been in the centrifugal field. Samples separated by these gradients are referred to as &quot;rate zonal&quot; centrifugations. After separating the protein/particles, the gradient is then fractionated and collected. In biochemistry, ultracentrifugation is valuable for separating biomolecules and analyzing their physical properties.

== Purification strategies ==

The choice of starting material is key to the design of a purification process. In a plant or animal, a particular protein usually is not distributed homogeneously throughout the body; different organs or tissues have higher or lower concentrations of the protein. The use of only the tissues or organs with the highest concentration decreases the volumes needed to produce a given amount of purified protein. If the protein is present in low abundance, or if it has a high value, scientists may use recombinant DNA technology to develop cells that will produce large quantities of the desired protein (this is known as an expression system). Recombinant expression allows the protein to be tagged, e.g. by a His-tag or Strep-tag to facilitate purification, reducing the number of purification steps required.

Analytical purification generally utilizes three properties to separate proteins. First, proteins may be purified according to their isoelectric points by running them through a pH-graded gel or an ion exchange column. Second, proteins can be separated according to their size or molecular weight via size exclusion chromatography or by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) analysis. Proteins are often purified by using 2D-PAGE and are then analysed by peptide mass fingerprinting to establish the protein identity. This is very useful for scientific purposes and the detection limits for protein are nowadays very low and nanogram amounts of protein are sufficient for their analysis. Thirdly, proteins may be separated by polarity/hydrophobicity via high-performance liquid chromatography or reversed-phase chromatography.

Usually, a protein purification protocol contains one or more chromatographic steps. The basic procedure in chromatography is to flow the solution containing the protein through a column packed with various materials. Different proteins interact differently with the column material, and can thus be separated by the time required to pass the column, or the conditions required to elute the protein from the column. Proteins are typically detected as they are coming off the column by their absorbance at 280 nm. Many different chromatographic methods exist:

=== Precipitation and differential solubilization ===
Most proteins require some salt to dissolve in water, a process called salting in. As the salt concentration is increased, proteins can precipitate, a process called salting out which involves changing protein solubility. For example, in bulk protein purification, a common first step to isolate proteins is precipitation with ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4. This is performed by adding increasing amounts of ammonium sulfate and collecting the different fractions of precipitated protein. Subsequently, ammonium sulfate can be removed using dialysis (separating proteins from small molecules through a semipermeable membrane). During the ammonium sulfate precipitation step, hydrophobic groups present on the proteins are exposed to the atmosphere, attracting other hydrophobic groups; the result is the formation of an aggregate of hydrophobic components. In this case, the protein precipitate will typically be visible to the naked eye. One advantage of this method is that it can be performed inexpensively, even with very large volumes.

The first proteins to be purified are water-soluble proteins. Purification of integral membrane proteins requires disruption of the cell membrane in order to isolate any one particular protein from others that are in the same membrane compartment. Sometimes a particular membrane fraction can be isolated first, such as isolating mitochondria from cells before purifying a protein located in a mitochondrial membrane. A detergent such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) can be used to dissolve cell membranes and keep membrane proteins in solution during purification; however, because SDS causes denaturation, milder detergents such as Triton X-100 or CHAPS can be used to retain the protein&#x27;s native conformation during complete purification.

=== Size exclusion (gel-filtration chromatography) ===

Chromatography can be used to separate protein in solution or denaturing conditions by using porous gels. This technique is a more discriminating separation and is known as size exclusion chromatography. The principle is that smaller molecules have to traverse a larger volume in a porous matrix. Consequentially, proteins of a certain range in size will require a variable volume of eluent (solvent) before being collected at the other end of the column of gel. Larger molecules (or proteins) will travel through less volume and elute prior to smaller molecules.

In the context of protein purification, the eluent is usually pooled in different test tubes. All test tubes containing no measurable trace of the protein to purify are discarded. The remaining solution is thus made of the protein to purify and any other similarly-sized proteins.

=== Separation based on charge (ion-exchange chromatography) ===

One chromatography technique based on molecular properties is usually not sufficient in obtaining a protein of high purity. In addition to size, ion exchange chromatography separates compounds according to the nature and degree of their ionic charge. The column to be used is selected according to its type and strength of charge. Anion exchange resins have a positive charge and are used to retain and separate negatively charged compounds (anions), while cation exchange resins have a negative charge and are used to separate positively charged molecules (cations).

Before the separation begins a buffer is pumped through the column to equilibrate the opposing charged ions. Upon injection of the sample, solute molecules will exchange with the buffer ions as each competes for the binding sites on the resin. The length of retention for each solute depends upon the strength of its charge. The most weakly charged compounds will elute first, followed by those with successively stronger charges. Because of the nature of the separating mechanism, pH, buffer type, buffer concentration, and temperature all play important roles in controlling the separation.

Ion exchange chromatography is a very powerful tool for use in protein purification and is frequently used in both analytical and preparative separations. It is especially useful when purifying nucleic-acid binding proteins, where separation of the protein from the bound nucleic acid is required to obtain a pure sample devoid of nucleic acids co-purified from the expression system or the native source. 

=== Free-flow-electrophoresis ===
Free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) is a carrier-free electrophoresis technique that allows preparative protein separation in a laminar buffer stream by using an orthogonal electric field. By making use of a pH-gradient, that can for example be induced by ampholytes, this technique allows to separate protein isoforms up to a resolution of &lt; 0.02 delta-pI.

=== Separation based on hydrophobicity (hydrophobic interaction chromatography) ===

HIC media is amphiphilic, with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, allowing for the separation of proteins based on their surface hydrophobicity. Target proteins and their product aggregate species tend to have different hydrophobic properties and removing them via HIC further purifies the protein of interest. Additionally, the environment used typically employs less harsh denaturing conditions than other chromatography techniques, thus helping to preserve the protein of interest in its native and functional state. In pure water, the interactions between the resin and the hydrophobic regions of protein would be very weak, but this interaction is enhanced by applying a protein sample to HIC resin in a high ionic strength buffer. The ionic strength of the buffer is then reduced to elute proteins in order of decreasing hydrophobicity.

=== Affinity chromatography===

Affinity Chromatography is another powerful separation technique that is highly selective for the protein of interest based upon molecular conformation, which frequently utilizes application specific resins. These resins have ligands attached to their surfaces which are specific for the compounds to be separated. Most frequently, these ligands function in a fashion similar to that of antibody-antigen interactions. This &quot;lock and key&quot; fit between the ligand and its target compound makes it highly specific, frequently generating a single peak, while all else in the sample is unretained.

Many membrane proteins are glycoproteins and can be purified by lectin affinity chromatography. Detergent-solubilized proteins can be allowed to bind to a chromatography resin that has been modified to have a covalently attached lectin. Proteins that do not bind to the lectin are washed away and then specifically bound glycoproteins can be eluted by adding a high concentration of a sugar that competes with the bound glycoproteins at the lectin binding site. Some lectins have high affinity binding to oligosaccharides of glycoproteins that is hard to compete with sugars, and bound glycoproteins need to be released by denaturing the lectin.

=== Immunoaffinity chromatography ===
Immunoaffinity chromatography uses the specific binding of an antibody-antigen to selectively purify the target protein. The procedure involves immobilizing a protein to a solid substrate (e.g. a porous bead or a membrane), which then selectively binds the target, while everything else flows through. The target protein can be eluted by changing the pH or the salinity. The immobilized ligand can be an antibody (such as immunoglobulin G) or it can be a protein (such as protein A). Because this method does not involve engineering in a tag, it can be used for proteins from natural sources.

=== HPLC ===
High-performance liquid chromatography or high-pressure liquid chromatography is a form of chromatography applying high pressure to drive the solutes through the column faster. This means that the diffusion is limited and the resolution is improved. The most common form is &quot;reversed phase&quot; HPLC, where the column material is hydrophobic. The proteins are eluted by a gradient of increasing amounts of an organic solvent, such as acetonitrile. The proteins elute according to their hydrophobicity. After purification by HPLC the protein is in a solution that only contains volatile compounds, and can easily be lyophilized. HPLC purification frequently results in denaturation of the purified proteins and is thus not applicable to proteins that do not spontaneously refold.

=== Purification of a tagged protein ===
Another way to tag proteins is to engineer an antigen peptide tag onto the protein, and then purify the protein on a column or by incubating with a loose resin that is coated with an immobilized antibody. This particular procedure is known as immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation is capable of generating an extremely specific interaction which usually results in binding only the desired protein. The purified tagged proteins can then easily be separated from the other proteins in solution and later eluted back into clean solution.

When the tags are not needed anymore, they can be cleaved off by a protease. This often involves engineering a protease cleavage site between the tag and the protein.

Self-cleaving tags eliminate the need for proteases to separate tag from target protein of interest during purification process (&quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;i&quot;CapTag™). The main component of the tag is an intein, which cleaves off simply after a pH change. Tagless and pure target protein is then released into the elution buffer.

== Concentration of the purified protein ==

At the end of a protein purification, the protein often has to be concentrated. Different methods exist.

=== Lyophilization ===
If the solution doesn&#x27;t contain any other soluble component than the protein in question the protein can be lyophilized (dried). This is commonly done after an HPLC run. This simply removes all volatile components, leaving the proteins behind.

===Ultrafiltration===
Ultrafiltration concentrates a protein solution using selective permeable membranes. The function of the membrane is to let the water and small molecules pass through while retaining the protein. The solution is forced against the membrane by mechanical pump, gas pressure, or centrifugation.

== Evaluating purification yield ==
The most general method to monitor the purification process is by running a SDS-PAGE of the different steps. This method only gives a rough measure of the amounts of different proteins in the mixture, and it is not able to distinguish between proteins with similar apparent molecular weight.

If the protein has a distinguishing spectroscopic feature or an enzymatic activity, this property can be used to detect and quantify the specific protein, and thus to select the fractions of the separation, that contains the protein. If antibodies against the protein are available then western blotting and ELISA can specifically detect and quantify the amount of desired protein. Some proteins function as receptors and can be detected during purification steps by a ligand binding assay, often using a radioactive ligand.

In order to evaluate the process of multistep purification, the amount of the specific protein has to be compared to the amount of total protein. The latter can be determined by the Bradford total protein assay or by absorbance of light at 280 nm, however some reagents used during the purification process may interfere with the quantification. For example, imidazole (commonly used for purification of polyhistidine-tagged recombinant proteins) is an amino acid analogue and at low concentrations will interfere with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay for total protein quantification. Impurities in low-grade imidazole will also absorb at 280 nm, resulting in an inaccurate reading of protein concentration from UV absorbance.

Another method to be considered is surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR can detect binding of label free molecules on the surface of a chip. If the desired protein is an antibody, binding can be translated directly to the activity of the protein. One can express the active concentration of the protein as the percent of the total protein. SPR can be a powerful method for quickly determining protein activity and overall yield. It is a powerful technology that requires an instrument to perform.

==Analytical==

=== Denaturing-condition electrophoresis ===

Gel electrophoresis is a common laboratory technique that can be used both as a preparative and analytical method. The principle of electrophoresis relies on the movement of a charged ion in an electric field. In practice, the proteins are denatured in a solution containing a detergent (SDS). In these conditions, the proteins are unfolded and coated with negatively charged detergent molecules. The proteins in SDS-PAGE are separated on the sole basis of their size.

In analytical methods, the protein migrate as bands based on size. Each band can be detected using stains such as Coomassie blue dye or silver stain. Preparative methods to purify large amounts of protein, require the extraction of the protein from the electrophoretic gel. This extraction may involve excision of the gel containing a band, or eluting the band directly off the gel as it runs off the end of the gel.

In the context of a purification strategy, denaturing condition electrophoresis provides an improved resolution over size exclusion chromatography, but does not scale to large quantity of proteins in a sample as well as the late chromatography columns.

=== Non-denaturing-condition electrophoresis ===

A non-denaturing electrophoretic procedure for isolating bioactive metalloproteins in complex protein mixtures is preparative native PAGE. The intactness or the structural integrity of the isolated protein has to be confirmed by an independent method.

<doc id="542746" wikidata="Q7563123" url="?curid=542746" title="Sophomoric humor">
<text>Sophomoric humor (also called juvenile humor or schoolboy humor) is any type of humor that is considered silly, immature, or childish. The phrase can be derisive, but is also used to refer to a style or type of comedic act.

It is a type of comedy that often includes toilet humor.

==Examples==
A critique of John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Short Reign of Pippin IV&quot; by Peter Lisca describes the story as lacking the burlesque humor of &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot;, the Rabelaisian humor of &quot;St. Katy the Virgin,&quot; the folk humor of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, the tender humor of &quot;Cannery Row&quot;, the &quot;terrible&quot; Swiftian humor of &quot;The Wayward Bus&quot;, and (instead) consisting of &quot;a sophomoric humor of grotesque improbability and wordplay.&quot; 

British comic &quot;Viz&quot; has been described as schoolboy humor.

American film director Judd Apatow&#x27;s work, including &quot;The 40 Year Old Virgin&quot;, &quot;Knocked Up&quot; and &quot;Funny People&quot;, has been described as using sophomoric humor, drawing laughs for jokes about sex, penises, and bodily functions.

<text>Morten Johannes Lauridsen III (born February 27, 1943) is an American composer and teacher. A National Medal of Arts recipient (2007), he was composer-in-residence of the Los Angeles Master Chorale from 1994 to 2001, and is professor emeritus of composition at the USC Thornton School of Music, where he taught for fifty-two years until his retirement in 2019.

== Biography ==
A native of the Pacific Northwest, Lauridsen worked as a Forest Service firefighter and lookout on an isolated tower near Mount St. Helens. He attended Whitman College for 2 years, before traveling south to study composition at the University of Southern California with Ingolf Dahl, Halsey Stevens, Robert Linn, and Harold Owen. He began teaching at USC in 1967.

In 2006, Lauridsen was named an &quot;American Choral Master&quot; by the National Endowment for the Arts. In 2007, he received the National Medal of Arts from the president in a White House ceremony, &quot;for his composition of radiant choral works combining musical beauty, power and spiritual depth that have thrilled audiences worldwide.&quot;

His works have been recorded on more than 200 CDs, five of which have received Grammy Award nominations, including &quot;O Magnum Mysterium&quot; by the Tiffany Consort, &quot;A Company of Voices&quot; by Conspirare, &quot;Sound The Bells&quot; by The Bay Brass, and two all-Lauridsen discs entitled &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; by the Los Angeles Master Chorale led by Paul Salamunovich and &quot;Nocturnes&quot; with the Polyphony choir and the Britten Sinfonia conducted by Stephen Layton.

A recipient of numerous grants, prizes, and commissions, Lauridsen chaired the composition department at the USC Thornton School of Music from 1990 to 2002 and founded the school&#x27;s advanced studies program in film scoring. He has held residencies as guest composer/lecturer at over 100 universities and has received honorary doctorates from Oklahoma State University, Westminster Choir College, King&#x27;s College, University of Aberdeen, and Whitman College. In 2014 he was invited to be honorary artistic president of Interkultur/World Choir Games. In 2016 he was awarded the ASCAP Foundation Life in Music Award. In late February 2020, via an update on his Facebook page, Lauridsen revealed he had retired from the Thornton School of Music in the spring of 2019, after having taught classes there for over 50 years.

Lauridsen divides his time between Los Angeles and his home in the San Juan Archipelago off the northern coast of Washington State.

==Compositions==

His eight vocal cycles and two collections—&quot;Les Chansons des Roses&quot; (Rilke), &quot;Mid-Winter Songs&quot; (Graves), &quot;A Winter Come&quot; (Moss), &quot;Madrigali: Six &quot;FireSongs&quot; on Italian Renaissance Poems&quot;, &quot;Nocturnes&quot; (Rilke, Neruda, and Agee), &quot;Cuatro Canciones&quot; (Lorca), &quot;Four Madrigals on Renaissance Texts&quot;, &quot;A Backyard Universe&quot;, &quot;Five Songs on American Poems&quot; (Moss, Witt, Gioia, and Agee) and &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot;—his series of sacred a cappella motets (&quot;O magnum mysterium&quot;, &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, &quot;O Nata Lux&quot;, &quot;Ubi caritas et amor&quot;, and &quot;Ave Dulcissima Maria&quot;) and numerous instrumental works are featured regularly in concert by artists and ensembles throughout the world. &quot;O Magnum Mysterium, Dirait-on&quot; (from &quot;Les Chansons des Roses&quot;), &quot;O Nata Lux&quot; (from &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot;), and &quot;Sure On This Shining Night&quot; (from &quot;Nocturnes&quot;) are best-selling choral octavos.

His musical approaches to the texts he sets are diverse, ranging from direct to abstract in response to characteristics (subject matter, language, style, structure, historical era, etc.). His Latin sacred settings, such as the &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; and motets, often reference Gregorian chant, as well as Medieval and Renaissance techniques while blending them with contemporary sounds. Other works such as the &quot;Madrigali&quot; and &quot;Cuatro Canciones&quot; are highly chromatic or atonal. His music has an overall lyricism and is tightly constructed around melodic and harmonic motifs.

Referring to Lauridsen&#x27;s religious music, the musicologist and conductor Nick Strimple said he is &quot;the only American composer in history who can be called a mystic, [...] Lauridsen&#x27;s probing, serene work contains an elusive and indefinable ingredient which leaves the impression that all the questions have been answered.&quot; From 1993, Lauridsen&#x27;s music rapidly increased in international popularity, and by the end of the century he had eclipsed Randall Thompson as the most frequently performed American choral composer.

<text>Aigaleo or Egaleo ( ) is a town and a suburban municipality in the western part of the Athens urban area, belonging to the West Athens regional administrative unit. It takes its name from Mount Aigaleo, whose name comes from the words αίγα/aiga/goat and λαός/laos/people. Its population was 65,831 at the 2021 census.

== Geography ==

Aigaleo is west of Athens city centre. The municipality has an area of . It is southeast of Mount Aigaleo. The Cephissus river flows through the industrialized eastern part of the municipality; about 1/4 of its area is taken up by factory developments. The town is served by two Metro stations: Egaleo and Agia Marina metro stations. The A1 motorway (Athens–Thessaloniki–Evzonoi) passes through the town.

Aigaleo consists of the quarters Kato Aigaleo, Neo Aigaleo, Damarakia, Lioumi, Rosika, Agios Spyridonas and Agios Georgios.

== History ==

During the ancient times, Aigaleo was primarily used by the tribes of Athens for farming and raising animals. In particular, the town was well-known for its excellent goat meat. Cleisthenes, the Athenian statesman and lawgiver credited with creating the constitution that gave birth to the democratic regime of ancient Athens, was born in Aigaleo. According to Herodotus, it was from the top of Mount Aigaleo that, in 480BC, Xerxes observed the Battle of Salamis and the destruction of the Persian fleet. Even after the Greek war of independence in 1821, life in the area remained largely rural and agrarian.
In 1874, the gunpowder factory &quot;Ελληνικόν Πυριτιδοποιείο&quot;/Ellinikon Pyritidopoieio was built, transforming Aigaleo into a heavily industrial area, covered by thick smog. In the dark tunnels where the construction sites operated, explosions often occurred and workers were buried alive. After each accident the blown-up galley was permanently sealed, without even declaring the dead. In 1908, after a merger, it was upgraded to a general ammunition production factory, and the company &quot;ΠΥΡΚΑΛ&quot;/PYRKAL was born. PYRKAL was the first modern Greek arm manufacturing company. With the ability to produce more than 60.000 bullets per day, including heavy weapon shells, it became the primary supplier of the Greek army.

After the fall of Smyrna in 1922 during the Greco-Turkish war, Aigaleo&#x27;s population greatly increased due to the settlement of mostly Greek refugees from Asia Minor and Pontus, but also of Assyrians. A significant number of refugees hailed specifically from the town of Kydonies (), now known as Ayvalık. This led to a name dispute between the refugees and the locals, with the former calling the area Νέες Κυδωνίες (&quot;Nées Kydoníes&quot;, &quot;New Kydonies&quot;) and the latter calling the area Μπαρουτάδικο (&quot;Baroutádiko&quot;, &quot;powder mill&quot;). Eventually the name dispute was settled, with an agreement to call the area by its ancient name. 

Aigaleo was a part of the municipality of Athens until 1934, when it became a separate community. It was raised to municipality status in 1943.
On September 29, 1944, during the Axis occupation of Greece, a massacre of at least 65 civilians (with estimates ranging up to 150 casualties) by the German forces took place in Aigaleo&#x27;s Agios Georgios neighborhood.

During the 1950s, in collaboration with NATO, the Aigaleo&#x27;s gunpowder factory began production once again. The later Greek army rearmament, however, consisted primarily of imported guns and bullets. As a result, the factory began producing less and less. During the 1970s the production was almost non-existent, consisting mainly of small amounts of hunting shells.
After the passage of new legislation prohibiting the existence of factories within the limits of urban areas, Aigaleo&#x27;s factory was declared illegal. The factory was finally moved to Elefsina in 1974. The old factory&#x27;s area was later sold to the Greek state and transformed into a forest, greatly improving the air quality in the area.

The city&#x27;s present mayor is , since the 2023 Greek local elections.

<text>Flogging Molly is an Irish-American seven-piece Celtic punk band formed in Los Angeles in 1994, led by Irish vocalist Dave King, formerly of the hard rock band Fastway. They are signed to their own record label, Borstal Beat Records.

==History==
===Early years===
Prior to forming Flogging Molly, Dublin-born Dave King was the lead singer for the heavy metal band Fastway featuring guitarist &quot;Fast&quot; Eddie Clarke of Motörhead in the early to mid-1980s. He later fronted a hard rock band called Katmandu (1991), featuring Mandy Meyer of Krokus and Asia on guitars. Afterward, King retained a record deal with Epic Records and began to work on a solo album, but began to reconsider his record deal when the label opposed his idea of bringing in traditional Irish instruments. King negotiated out of his record deal to go his own way musically soon after.

In 1993, King met violin player Bridget Regan, guitarist Ted Hutt, bassist Jeff Peters and drummer Paul Crowder, and put together a rock band with a Celtic music influence. They began to play a mix of Irish traditional and rock music. Putting King&#x27;s poetic lyrics to rocking melodies, they played weekly at a Los Angeles pub called Molly Malone&#x27;s, building a small but loyal following. Together, they wrote songs such as &quot;Black Friday Rule&quot; and &quot;Selfish Man&quot;, which was the beginning of Flogging Molly&#x27;s sound. Ted and Jeff then left Flogging Molly because an earlier band of theirs, Reacharound, received a record deal. King and Regan began to find new members and the current band was formed.

They continued a routine of playing every Monday night at Molly Malone&#x27;s. They put out a live album, &quot;Alive Behind the Green Door&quot;, in 1997. In an interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine, King stated that the band&#x27;s name comes from the bar (Molly Malone&#x27;s) that faithfully supported the band from the very beginning, &quot;We used to play there every Monday night and we felt like we were flogging it to death, so we called the band Flogging Molly.&quot; They were signed onto SideOneDummy Records after a show when the record company&#x27;s owners attended a concert and noted their intensity.

===Career===
The band’s debut studio album,&quot; Swagger&quot;, arrived on March 7, 2000, their first of many with SideOneDummy. They joined the Vans Warped Tour for the first time that summer alongside Green Day, Weezer, and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones (whom they continued touring alongside in the fall).

&quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot; followed on March 19, 2002, and was certified gold by the RIAA in 2009. They returned to the Warped Tour in 2003 with a lineup that included The All-American Rejects and Dropkick Murphys.

&quot;Within a Mile of Home&quot;, released on September 14, 2004, debuted at No. 20 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;. The acoustic/live CD/DVD combo, &quot;Whiskey on a Sunday&quot;, was released in 2006 and certified platinum two years later. It was followed by the 2007 online-only EP, &quot;Complete Control Sessions&quot;.

The group’s fourth studio album, &quot;Float&quot;, debuted at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; in 2008 and produced two well-received singles: &quot;Requiem for a Dying Song&quot; (No. 35 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts) and the title track (No. 40).

March 2010&#x27;s &quot;Live at the Greek Theatre&quot; captured a career-spanning Los Angeles, California performance from the year before as a CD/DVD set. In 2011, Flogging Molly appeared in the season premiere of Austin City Limits.
2011&#x27;s &quot;Speed of Darkness&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album issued through their own label, Borstal Beat Records.

&quot;Life Is Good&quot;, the band&#x27;s first new album in six years, arrived in 2017. It is the only Flogging Molly album released via Vanguard Records and Spinefarm. They co-headlined a US tour with Social Distortion in 2019.

The band live-streamed a St. Patrick&#x27;s Day performance on March 17, 2021, from Whelan’s Irish Pub in Dublin, Ireland. A portion of the proceeds from ticket sales went toward Sweet Relief’s COVID-19 Crew Fund. They co-headlined a tour with Violent Femmes the same year.

Flogging Molly released their seventh studio album, &quot;Anthem&quot;, in 2022, their first with Rise Records. They co-headlined a tour with The Interrupters the same year.

In November 2023, the band announced the inaugural Shamrock Rebellion Fest, scheduled for March 16, 2024, in Silverado, California, and March 17, 2024, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Road To Rebellion Tour preceded the fest, with support coming from Amigo The Devil.

Flogging Molly performed The Pogues&#x27; &quot;The Old Main Drag&quot; at the Sinéad &amp; Shane (billed as &quot;a St. Paddy&#x27;s Celebration of Sinéad O&#x27;Connor and Shane MacGowan&quot;) at Carnegie Hall concert in New York City on March 20, 2024.

After a June 20, 2024, fire damaged Molly Malone&#x27;s Irish Pub, where the band got their start, the band launched a merchandise line to raise money for the venue and staff.

The band began a European tour on July 19, 2024, which ran through September, with stops at several major festivals, followed by a headlining tour of the United States from late September through mid-October 2024.

=== Salty Dog Cruises (2015–present) ===
From March 13 to 16, 2015, Flogging Molly began hosting a yearly Caribbean cruise. The 2015 Salty Dog Cruise Cruise featured shows by the band and many others, over three days leaving from Miami to Nassau and Great Stirrup Cay on the &quot;Norwegian Sky&quot;. All bands performed two times on the stages throughout the ship or on the special stage set on Norwegian&#x27;s private island of Great Stirrup Cay.

In 2016, from March 18 to 21, the second yearly cruise took the same itinerary on the same ship and hosted, among others, Rancid, Fishbone, Frank Turner, Street Dogs and The Tossers.

In 2017, the &quot;Enchantment of the Seas&quot; hosted the third annual cruise that left on March 10 to Coco Cay and Nassau, until coming back to Miami on March 13. The guests invited by the band were NOFX, DeVotchKa, Less Than Jake, The English Beat, The Skatalites, The Bouncing Souls, Dylan Walshe and many others.

On August 21, 2017, the band announced that the 2018 cruise would take place April 20–23, leaving from Miami, sailing to Key West and to Great Stirrup Cay. Originally, the cruise was supposed to take place on the &quot;Enchantment of the Seas&quot; in 2017; however, the ship was changed, and the Norwegian Sky has been announced. The line-up includes The Offspring, Buzzcocks, The Vandals, Lagwagon, and Mad Caddies, among others.

The Salty Dog Cruise 2023 ran November 8–13, sailing from Miami to Harvest Caye, Belize, and Costa Maya, Mexico. The line-up included Flogging Molly, Pennywise, Stiff Little Fingers, The Vandals, and Gorilla Biscuits, among others, with a Port of Miami kickoff show featuring The Interrupters.

In late November 2023, the band announced the next Salty Dog Cruise, set for February 17–22, 2025, sailing from Miami to Grand Cayman, and Ochos Rios, Jamaica. As of December 15, 2023, the 2025 cruise was sold out.

On February 5, 2025, the band announced that they would not be performing on the 2025 Salty Dog Cruise as Dave King is battling a serious health condition.

==Musical style==
Flogging Molly&#x27;s music is influenced by various artists, such as The Dubliners, The Pogues, Horslips, Johnny Cash, and The Clash. The album &quot;Within a Mile of Home&quot; (2004) is dedicated to the memories of Cash and The Clash frontman Joe Strummer.

Their music ranges from boisterous Celtic punk, like the pirate-themed &quot;Salty Dog&quot;, &quot;Cruel Mistress&quot;, and &quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, or the defiant &quot;What&#x27;s Left of the Flag&quot;, &quot;Drunken Lullabies&quot;, and &quot;Rebels of the Sacred Heart&quot;, to more somber songs like &quot;Far Away Boys&quot;, &quot;The Son Never Shines (On Closed Doors)&quot;, &quot;Life in a Tenement Square&quot;, and &quot;Float&quot;. Lyrics typically touch on subjects such as Ireland and its history, drinking, poverty, politics, love, and death and include several references to the Catholic Church. &quot;What&#x27;s Left of the Flag&quot; and &quot;The Likes of You Again&quot; were written as tributes to King&#x27;s father, who died when King was a child.

<doc id="542776" wikidata="Q162266" url="?curid=542776" title="Hemolytic–uremic syndrome">
<text>Hemolytic–uremic syndrome (HUS) is a group of blood disorders characterized by low red blood cells, acute kidney injury (previously called acute renal failure), and low platelets. Initial symptoms typically include bloody diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and weakness. Kidney problems and low platelets then occur as the diarrhea progresses. Children are more commonly affected, but most children recover without permanent damage to their health, although some children may have serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. Adults, especially the elderly, may show a more complicated presentation. Complications may include neurological problems and heart failure.

Most cases occur after infectious diarrhea due to a specific type of &quot;E. coli&quot; called O157:H7. Other causes include &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Shigella&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, and certain medications. The underlying mechanism typically involves the production of Shiga toxin by the bacteria. Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is often due to a genetic mutation and presents differently. However, both can lead to widespread inflammation and multiple blood clots in small blood vessels, a condition known as thrombotic microangiopathy.

Treatment involves supportive care and may include dialysis, steroids, blood transfusions, or plasmapheresis. About 1.5 per 100,000 people are affected per year. Less than 5% of those with the condition die. Of the remainder, up to 25% have ongoing kidney problems. HUS was first defined as a syndrome in 1955.

==Signs and symptoms==
After eating contaminated food, the first symptoms of infection can emerge anywhere from 1 to 10 days later, but usually after 3 to 4 days. These early symptoms can include diarrhea (which is often bloody), stomach cramps, mild fever, or vomiting that results in dehydration and reduced urine. HUS typically develops about 5–10 days after the first symptoms, but can take up to 3 weeks to manifest, and occurs at a time when the diarrhea is improving. Related symptoms and signs include lethargy, decreased urine output, blood in the urine, kidney failure, low platelets, (which are needed for blood clotting), and destruction of red blood cells (microangiopathic hemolytic anemia). High blood pressure, jaundice (a yellow tinge in skin and the whites of the eyes), seizures, and bleeding into the skin can also occur. In some cases, there are prominent neurologic changes.

People with HUS commonly exhibit the symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), which can include abdominal pain, low platelet count, elevated lactate dehydrogenase LDH, (an enzyme released from damaged cells, and which is therefore a marker of cellular damage) decreased haptoglobin (indicative of the breakdown of red blood cells) anemia (low red blood cell count), schistocytes (damaged red blood cells), elevated creatinine (a protein waste product generated by muscle metabolism and eliminated renally), proteinuria (indicative of kidney injury), confusion, fatigue, swelling, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. Additionally, patients with aHUS typically present with an abrupt onset of systemic signs and symptoms such as acute kidney failure, hypertension (high blood pressure), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, lung complications, pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), liver necrosis (death of liver cells or tissue), encephalopathy (brain dysfunction), seizure, and coma. Failure of neurologic, cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal (GI) organs, as well as death, can occur unpredictably at any time, either very quickly or following prolonged symptomatic or asymptomatic disease progression.

==Cause==
===Typical HUS===
Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) HUS occurs after ingestion of a strain of bacteria expressing Shiga toxin such as enterohemorrhagic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (EHEC), of which &quot;E. coli O157:H7&quot; is the most common serotype.

===Atypical HUS===

Atypical HUS (aHUS) represents 5–10% of HUS cases and is largely due to one or several genetic mutations that cause chronic, uncontrolled, and excessive activation of the complement system, which is a group of immune signaling factors that promote inflammation, enhance the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from the body, and directly attack the pathogen&#x27;s cell membrane. This results in platelet activation, endothelial cell damage, and white blood cell activation, leading to systemic TMA, which manifests as decreased platelet count, hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells), damage to multiple organs, and ultimately death. Early signs of systemic complement-mediated TMA include thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 150,000 or a decrease from baseline of at least 25%) and evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, which is characterized by elevated LDH levels, decreased haptoglobin, decreased hemoglobin (the oxygen-containing component of blood), and/or the presence of schistocytes. Despite the use of supportive care, an estimated 33–40% of patients will die or have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with the first clinical manifestation of aHUS, and 65% of patients will die, require dialysis, or have permanent renal damage within the first year after diagnosis despite plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI) therapy. Patients who survive the presenting signs and symptoms of aHUS endure a chronic thrombotic and inflammatory state, which puts them at lifelong elevated risk of sudden blood clotting, kidney failure, other severe complications and premature death.

Historically, treatment options for aHUS were limited to plasma exchange or plasma infusion (PE/PI) therapy, which carries significant risks and has not been proven effective in any controlled trials. People with aHUS and ESRD have also had to undergo lifelong dialysis, which has a 5-year survival rate of 34–38%.

==Pathogenesis==
HUS is caused by ingestion of bacteria that produce Shiga toxins, with Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) being the most common type. &quot;E. coli&quot; can produce shigatoxin-1, shigatoxin-2, or both; with shigatoxin-2 producing organisms being more virulent and being much more likely to cause HUS. Once ingested, the bacteria move to the intestines where they produce the Shiga toxins. The bacteria and toxins damage the mucosal lining of the intestines, and thus are able to gain entry into the circulation. Shiga toxin enters the mesenteric microvasculature lining the intestines where it releases inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, and IL-1β. These inflammatory mediators lead to inflammation and vascular injury with microthrombi that are seen with HUS. It also further damages the intestinal barrier leading to diarrhea (usually bloody) and further entry of Shiga toxin from the intestines to the bloodstream as the intestinal barrier is compromised.

Once Shiga toxin enters the circulation it can travel throughout the body and cause the wide array of end organ damage and the multitude of symptoms seen with HUS. Shiga toxin gains entry to cells by binding to globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) which is a globoside found on cell membranes, it is found throughout the body including the surface of the glomerular endothelium of the kidney. Shiga toxin gains entry to the cell via Gb3 and endocytosis, it then is transported to the Golgi apparatus where furin cleaves the A subunit of the Shiga toxin. It is then transported to the endoplasmic reticulum where it is further cleaved, leaving the A1 subunit of Shiga toxin free. The A1 subunit of Shiga toxin inhibits the 28s subunit of the ribosomal rRNA, this leads to inhibited protein production by the ribosomes. With the cell&#x27;s protein synthesis inhibited by Shiga toxin, the cell is destroyed. This leads to vascular injury (including in the kidneys where Gb3 is concentrated). The vascular injury facilitates the formation of vascular microthrombi which are characteristic of TTP. The TTP leads to platelet trapping (and thrombocytopenia), red blood cell destruction (and anemia), and end organ damage that is characteristically seen with HUS and TTP.

HUS is one of the thrombotic microangiopathies, a category of disorders that includes STEC-HUS, aHUS, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The release of cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-1β) that are commonly released by Shiga toxin are implicated in platelet activation and TTP. The presence of schistocytes is a key finding that helps to diagnose HUS.

Shiga-toxin directly activates the alternative complement pathway and also interferes with complement regulation by binding to complement factor H, an inhibitor of the complement cascade. Shiga-toxin causes complement-mediated platelet, leukocyte, and endothelial cell activation, resulting in systemic hemolysis, inflammation and thrombosis. Severe clinical complications of TMA have been reported in patients from 2 weeks to more than 44 days after presentation with STEC-HUS, with improvements in clinical condition extending beyond this time frame, suggesting that complement activation persists beyond the acute clinical presentation and for at least 4 months.

The consumption of platelets as they adhere to the thrombi lodged in the small vessels typically leads to mild or moderate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of less than 60,000 per microliter. As in the related condition TTP, reduced blood flow through the narrowed blood vessels of the microvasculature leads to reduced blood flow to vital organs, and ischemia may develop. The kidneys and the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) are the parts of the body most critically dependent on high blood flow, and are thus the most likely organs to be affected. However, in comparison to TTP, the kidneys tend to be more severely affected in HUS, and the central nervous system is less commonly affected.

In contrast with typical disseminated intravascular coagulation seen with other causes of sepsis and occasionally with advanced cancer, coagulation factors are not consumed in HUS (or TTP) and the coagulation screen, fibrinogen level, and assays for fibrin degradation products such as &quot;D-Dimers&quot;, are generally normal despite the low platelet count (thrombocytopenia).

HUS occurs after 3–7% of all sporadic &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 infections and up to approximately 20% or more of epidemic infections. Children and adolescents are commonly affected. One reason could be that children have more Gb3 receptors than adults which may be why children are more susceptible to HUS. Cattle, swine, deer, and other mammals do not have GB3 receptors, but can be asymptomatic carriers of Shiga toxin-producing bacteria. Some humans can also be asymptomatic carriers. Once the bacteria colonizes, diarrhea followed by bloody diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, typically follows. Other serotypes of STEC also cause disease, inlduding HUS, as occurred with &quot;E. coli&quot; O104:H4, which triggered a 2011 epidemic of STEC-HUS in Germany.

Grossly, the kidneys may show patchy or diffuse renal cortical necrosis. Histologically, the glomeruli show thickened and sometimes split capillary walls due largely to endothelial swelling. Large deposits of fibrin-related materials in the capillary lumens, subendothelially, and in the mesangium are also found along with mesangiolysis. Interlobular and afferent arterioles show fibrinoid necrosis and intimal hyperplasia and are often occluded by thrombi.

STEC-HUS most often affects infants and young children, but also occurs in adults. The most common form of transmission is ingestion of undercooked meat, unpasteurized fruits and juices, contaminated produce, contact with unchlorinated water, and person-to-person transmission in daycare or long-term care facilities.

Unlike typical HUS, aHUS does not follow STEC infection and is thought to result from one or several genetic mutations that cause chronic, uncontrolled, and excessive activation of complement. This leads to platelet activation, endothelial cell damage, and white blood cell activation, leading to systemic TMA, which manifests as decreased platelet count, hemolysis, damage to multiple organs, and ultimately, death. Early signs of systemic complement-mediated TMA include thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 150,000 or a decrease from baseline of at least 25%) and evidence of microangiopathic hemolysis, which is characterized by elevated LDH levels, decreased haptoglobin, decreased hemoglobin, and/or the presence of schistocytes.

==Diagnosis==
The similarities between HUS, aHUS, and TTP make differential diagnosis essential. All three of these systemic TMA-causing diseases are characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolysis, plus one or more of the following: neurological symptoms (e.g., confusion, cerebral convulsions, seizures); renal impairment (e.g., elevated creatinine, decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], abnormal urinalysis); and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, gastroenteritis).The presence of diarrhea does not exclude aHUS as the cause of TMA, as 28% of patients with aHUS present with diarrhea and/or gastroenteritis. First diagnosis of aHUS is often made in the context of an initial, complement-triggering infection, and Shiga-toxin has also been implicated as a trigger that identifies patients with aHUS. Additionally, in one study, mutations of genes encoding several complement regulatory proteins were detected in 8 of 36 (22%) patients diagnosed with STEC-HUS. However, the absence of an identified complement regulatory gene mutation does not preclude aHUS as the cause of the TMA, as approximately 50% of patients with aHUS lack an identifiable mutation in complement regulatory genes.

Diagnostic work-up supports the differential diagnosis of TMA-causing diseases. A positive Shiga-toxin/EHEC test confirms a cause for STEC-HUS, and severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (i.e., ≤5% of normal ADAMTS13 levels) confirms a diagnosis of TTP.

==Prevention==
The effect of antibiotics in shiga toxin producing &quot;E. coli&quot; is unclear. While some early studies raised concerns more recent studies show either no effect or a benefit.

==Treatment==
Treatment involves supportive care and may include dialysis, steroids, blood transfusions, and plasmapheresis. Early IV fluid hydration is associated with better outcomes including shorter hospital stays and reducing the risk of dialysis.

Empiric antibiotics are not indicated in those who are immunocompetent, and may worsen the HUS. Antidiarrheals and narcotic medications to slow the gut are not recommended as they are associated with worsening symptoms, increased risk of HUS in those with STEC infection, and adverse neurologic reactions. Platelet transfusions should not be used as the may drive the process of microangiopathy leading to worsening TTP.

While eculizumab is being used to treat atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, no evidence as of 2018 supports its use in the main forms of HUS. Scientists are trying to understand how useful it would be to immunize humans or cattle.

==Prognosis==
Acute renal failure occurs in 55–70% of people with STEC-HUS, although up to 70–85% recover renal function. With aggressive treatment, more than 90% of patients survive the acute phase of HUS, and only about 9% may develop ESRD. Roughly one-third of persons with HUS have abnormal kidney function many years later, and a few require long-term dialysis. Another 8% of persons with HUS have other lifelong complications, such as high blood pressure, seizures, blindness, paralysis, and the effects of having part of their colon removed. STEC-HUS is associated with a 3% mortality rate among young children and a 20% mortality rate in middle age or older adults. 15-20% of children infected with STEC develop HUS, with the highest risk being in children younger than 5 years old.

Patients with aHUS generally have poor outcomes, with up to 50% progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or irreversible brain damage; as many as 25% die during the acute phase.

==History==
HUS is now considered as a part of the broader group of Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA). Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a TMA, was first described by the Hungarian born, American pathologist and physician Eli Moschcowitz (18791964). In 1924, Moschcowitz first described TTP as a distinct clinicopathologic condition that can mimic the clinical characteristics of Hemolytic–uremic syndrome (HUS). That was in a 16-year-old girl who died 2 weeks after the abrupt onset and progression of petechial bleeding, pallor, fever, paralysis, hematuria and coma; and called &quot;Moschcowitz disease&quot;. Moreover, Moschcowitz was among the first to work in psychosomatic medicine, and he presented a paper in 1935 on the psychological origins of physical disease. HUS was first described by Conrad Gasser in 1955, and the systemic character of HUS was subsequently defined. Bernard Kaplan identified several distinct entities that can manifest as HUS and emphasized that HUS was a syndrome with a common pathologic outcome. Kaplan is a Canadian professor and director of Pediatric Nephrology. He has an international reputation for his studies, over the past 34 years, on the hemolytic uremic syndromes. The discovery that endothelial cell injury underlies this broad spectrum of TMA disorders has come into focus during the last two decades. In the 1980s, Mohamed Karmali (1945–2016) was the first to make the association between Stx, diarrheal E. coli infection and the idiopathic hemolytic uremic syndrome of infancy and childhood. Karmali&#x27;s work showed that the hemolytic uremic syndrome the children in Canada was caused by this particular bacteria. Karmali also developed the system of classifying strains of E.coli and determining which cause disease in humans. He defined the presence of microvascular injury in diarrhea-associated HUS and the critical role of a verotoxin produced by specific strains of Escherichia coli. This verotoxin was subsequently found to be a member of a family of toxins first identified with Shigella and known as Shiga toxin (Stx). This relationship and the eventual link of TTP to abnormally high levels of ultra-large Von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers caused by congenital or acquired reductions in ADAMTS13 activity was established at approximately the same time. In 1924, a Finnish physician Erik Adolf von Willebrand (1870–1949) was consulted about a young girl with a bleeding disorder. Von Willebrand described this disorder in 1926, distinguishing it from hemophilia. The disorder was named after him, becoming known as von Willebrand disease. The cause of the disease was later discovered to be a deficiency of a protein, now known as von Willebrand factor, that enables hemostasis. Paul Warwicker is an English nephrologist, whilst in Newcastle in the mid-1990s his research in molecular genetics with Professors Tim and Judith Goodship led to the genetic mapping of the familial form of atypical HUS and the descriptions of the first HUS-related mutations and polymorphisms in the factor H gene in both familial and sporadic HUS. He was awarded an MD in molecular genetics in 2000, and elected fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in the same year. Paul Warwicker confirmed the association of atypical HUS (aHUS) to defects in a region on chromosome 1 that contains the genes for several complement regulatory proteins. Later, mutations in complement factor H, complement factor I, membrane cofactor protein, factor B, C3, and thrombomodulin have now been found to cause many of the familial cases of aHUS. These discoveries have allowed a more comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis, evaluation, and treatment of the entire spectrum of TMA disorders and provide a more rational and effective approach to the care of these children with complicated disease. Prior to the use of monoclonal antibodies patients with aHUS had an extremely poor prognosis. Eculizumab (Soliris®, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Boston, MA, USA) is a humanized monoclonal complement inhibitor that is the first and only approved treatment for patients with aHUS by FDA in September 2011. Eculizumab binds with high affinity to C5, inhibiting C5 cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9, thus inhibiting complement-mediated TMA. Eculizumab was proven to be effective in patients with aHUS in which it resolved and prevented complement-mediated TMA, improving renal function and hematologic outcomes. Alexion head of R&amp;D &#x27;John Orloff, M.D. &quot;The results met the high bar of complete TMA response, defined by hematologic normalization and improved kidney function,&quot; said Alexion R&amp;D head John Orloff, M.D., who reckons the drug can become the &quot;new standard of care for patients with aHUS.&quot; &quot;We are preparing regulatory submissions for Ultomiris in aHUS in the U.S., European Union and Japan as quickly as possible,&quot; he added.

==Epidemiology==
The country with the highest incidence of HUS is Argentina and it performs a key role in the research of this condition.

In the United States, the overall incidence of HUS is estimated at 2.1 cases per 100,000 persons/year, with a peak incidence between six months and four years of age.

HUS and the &quot;E. coli&quot; infections that cause it have been the source of much negative publicity for the FDA, meat industries, and fast-food restaurants since the 1990s, especially in the contaminations linked to Jack in the Box restaurants. In 2006, an epidemic of harmful &quot;E. coli&quot; emerged in the United States due to contaminated spinach. In June 2009, Nestlé Toll House cookie dough was linked to an outbreak of &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 in the United States, which sickened 70 people in 30 states.

In May 2011 an epidemic of bloody diarrhea caused by &quot;E. coli&quot; O104:H4-contaminated fenugreek seeds hit Germany. Tracing the epidemic revealed more than 3,800 cases, with HUS developing in more than 800 of the cases, including 36 fatal cases. Nearly 90% of the HUS cases were in adults.

<text>Franklin Rosborough Thomas (September 5, 1912 – September 8, 2004) was an American animator and pianist. He was one of Walt Disney&#x27;s leading team of animators known as the Nine Old Men.

== Biography ==
Thomas was born on September 5, 1912, in Santa Monica, California, to Frank Thomas, a teacher, and Ina Gregg. He had two older brothers, Lawrence and Welburne. He grew up in Fresno. Frank Thomas attended Stanford University, where he was a member of Theta Delta Chi fraternity and worked on campus humor magazine &quot;The Stanford Chaparral&quot; with Ollie Johnston. After graduating from Stanford in 1933, he attended Chouinard Art Institute, then joined The Walt Disney Company on September 24, 1934, as employee number 224. There he animated dozens of feature films and shorts, and also was a member of the Dixieland band Firehouse Five Plus Two, playing the piano.

== Career ==

His work in animated cartoon shorts included &quot;Brave Little Tailor&quot;, in which he animated scenes of Mickey Mouse and the king, Mickey and the bear in &quot;The Pointer&quot;, and German dialogue scenes in the World War II propaganda short &quot;Education for Death&quot; (shortly before Thomas enlisted in the Army Air Forces). During World War II he was assigned to the First Motion Picture Unit where he made training films.

In feature films, among the characters and scenes Thomas animated were the dwarfs crying over Snow White&#x27;s &quot;dead&quot; body, Pinocchio singing at the marionette theatre, Bambi and Thumper on the ice, &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; eating spaghetti, the three fairies in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, Merlin and Arthur as squirrels and the &quot;wizard&#x27;s duel&quot; between Merlin and Madam Mim in &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; (in which he was paired with animator Milt Kahl to great effect), King Louie in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (the song number &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You&quot; featuring King Louie and Baloo the Bear re-teamed him with Kahl), the dancing penguins in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, and Winnie The Pooh and Piglet in &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; and &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too&quot;. Thomas was directing animator for several memorable villains, including the evil stepmother Lady Tremaine in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, the Queen of Hearts in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Captain James Hook in &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, and story consultant in &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot;.
He retired from Disney on January 31, 1978. In the 1980s and 1990s, Thomas served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute and often was a presenter at the annual film festival&#x27;s award ceremonies.

Thomas co-authored, with fellow Disney legend Ollie Johnston, the comprehensive book &quot;Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life&quot;, first published by Abbeville Press in 1981. Regarded as the definitive resource book on traditional hand-drawn character animation (particularly in the Disney style), the book has been republished numerous times, and is widely considered &quot;the bible&quot; among character animators. The book summarized the Disney approach to animation through the so-called 12 basic principles of animation.

Thomas and Johnston were also profiled in the 1995 documentary &quot;Frank and Ollie&quot;, which screened at the 20th Toronto International Film Festival, directed by Thomas&#x27;s son Theodore Thomas. The film profiled their careers, private lives, and the personal friendship between the two men. In 2012, Theodore Thomas also directed another short documentary, &quot;Growing up with Nine Old Men&quot;, included in the Diamond edition of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot; DVD.

Thomas&#x27;s last work in an animated film before his death was for &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (directed by Brad Bird), although he voiced a character, rather than animating one. Frank and his friend and colleague Ollie Johnston voiced and were caricatured as two old men saying &quot;That&#x27;s old school ...&quot; &quot;Yeah, no school like the old school.&quot; The pair had previously been heard, and caricatured, as the two train engineers in Bird&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;. Thomas died in La Cañada Flintridge, California, on September 8, 2004, three days after his 92nd birthday. His widow, Jeanette A. Thomas, died on September 29, 2012.

The 2001 biography &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men &amp; The Art of Animation&quot; by John Canemaker () chronicles Thomas&#x27; life.

On the &quot;Animation Podcast&quot;, Disney director John Musker discussed Frank Thomas, and mentioned that at one time, fellow animation great Chuck Jones had christened Thomas the &quot;Laurence Olivier of animators.&quot;

<doc id="542788" wikidata="Q3185137" url="?curid=542788" title="Joseph Jefferson">
<text>Joseph Jefferson III (February 20, 1829 – April 23, 1905), often known as Joe Jefferson, was an American actor. He was the third actor of this name in a family of actors and managers, and one of the most famous 19th century American comedians. Beginning as a young child, he continued as a performer for most of his 76 years. Jefferson was particularly well known for his adaptation and portrayal of Rip Van Winkle on the stage, reprising the role in several silent film adaptations. After 1865, he created no other major role and toured with this play for decades.

==Life and career==
Jefferson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, Joseph Jefferson Jr., was a scenic designer and actor and his mother an actress. He appeared onstage early in life, often being used when a play called for &quot;a babe in arms&quot;. His first recorded appearance was at the Washington Theatre in Washington, D.C., where he appeared in a benefit performance for the minstrel Thomas D. Rice. 

Jefferson was married twice: at the age of 21 in 1850, to actress Margaret Clements Lockyer (1832–1861), who died young after bearing their four children. After Jefferson returned to the United States after the end of the Civil War, he married again in 1867 to Sarah Warren. She was the niece of British-American actor William Warren.

===Early career===
In 1833, at the age of four years, Jefferson was carried on stage at the Washington theatre in a bag by an actor named Thomas D. Rice. He put Jefferson alongside him in black face and dress with Rice performing his well-known character &quot;Jim Crow&quot; and little Joseph as Little Joe. In 1837, at age eight, Joseph performed at the Franklin theatre in New York City with his parents as a pirate. After the end of the 1837–38 season, his parents moved with Joseph, his brother Charles Burke, and his sister, Cornelia, to Chicago. There they performed in the young city&#x27;s first resident company, the Chicago Theater, at the rough-hewn Sauganash Hotel. Joseph sang comic songs, played bit parts, and performed the role of the Duke of York.

His father died when he was 13, and young Jefferson continued acting and helping to support the family. Both Jefferson and Burke performed continuously, and the entire family toured in what was then considered the American West and South. Traveling theatre to theatre, Jefferson performed and worked everywhere in between Boston to Charleston as far as Chicago. The family led the lives of &quot;strolling players&quot;, essentially itinerant actors. 

At one point they followed the American army from 1846 to 1848 during the Mexican–American War. Jefferson learned to perform in a variety of space, for instance in the dining rooms of country hotels, without any stage or scenery. He put together makeshift footlights by mounting tallow candles on a strip board nailed to the floor. He was one of the seven founding members of the Actors&#x27; Order of Friendship, a benevolent society founded in Philadelphia in 1849. He also served as the Order&#x27;s first Secretary. It was not until after he returned to New York in 1849 that he began earning critical success and financial rewards.

After this experience, partly as actor, partly as manager, he won his first pronounced success in 1858 as Asa Trenchard in Tom Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; at Laura Keene&#x27;s Theatre in New York. This play was the turning-point of his career, as it would be for actor E. A. Sothern. Jefferson revealed a new spirit in comedy, at a time when actors were long used to a more artificial convention. He also portrayed pathos in the part.

Other early parts included Newman Noggs in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, Caleb Plummer in &quot;Dot&quot; (an adaption of &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot;), Dr. Pangloss in George Colman the Younger&#x27;s &quot;The Heir at Law&quot;, Salem Scudder in &quot;The Octoroon&quot;, and Bob Acres in &quot;The Rivals&quot;. The actors created this part beyond what Sheridan appears to sketch.

In 1859, Jefferson made a dramatic adaptation of Washington Irving&#x27;s story of &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;, drawing from older plays. He acted it with success in Washington, D.C., with Sophie Gimber Kuhn playing the role of Lowenna.

===Australia and London===
In 1861, due to his failing health and the death of his wife, he moved to San Francisco and then sailed to Australia. He arrived at Sydney in the beginning of November 1861, and played a successful season. He performed in and produced &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;, &quot;Our American Cousin&quot;, &quot;The Octoroon&quot;, and other plays. He opened in Melbourne on March 31, 1862, and had a most successful season extending over about six months. He continued to act there and in Tasmania. In his spare time in Australia he was a painter, specialising in landscapes.

Jefferson started writing while he was abroad in Australia, and on his way back to America in 1865 he heard news of the end of the war and Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s assassination by John Wilkes Booth. This news was particularly weight bearing due to Jefferson&#x27;s personal connection to both parties. Jefferson and Booth were acquaintances and Booth&#x27;s brother was one of Jefferson&#x27;s closest friends and Lincoln was one of the Jeffersons family benefactors almost a decade earlier. Jefferson, who was generally known for being just as fun loving and alive as he was on stage as one of the most brilliant comedic actors of the nineteenth century, did not show any visible reaction to the news. However, his son Charley recounted that the news &quot;jolted his father and sent him into uncharacteristic despondency.&quot; This jolting news sent Jefferson&#x27;s sails to England instead of America, where he would begin to throw himself into his work. With the help of play doctor Dion Boucicault, &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; took to the stage that very year, opening at the Adelphi Theatre in London September 4, 1865. In London, the play was less of a success compared to Jefferson&#x27;s acting job. A London theatre historian several decades later recounted, &quot;No truer, more pathetic, or purely artistic piece of acting, within its limits, has ever been seen upon the English stage than Jefferson&#x27;s rendering of Washington Irving&#x27;s vagabond hero.&quot; Dion Boucicault, who revised &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;, turned it into &quot;a pronounced success and [it] ran for one hundred and seventy nights.&quot; With opening night on September 5, 1865 at the Adelphi Theatre in London, Jefferson portrayed what would become one of the most celebrated characters of the 19th-century stage.

===Later years===
Jefferson returned to America in August 1866. He continued acting in &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; for 40 years, creating no new character except for minor ones. He was known for this single character, and admired for his success in London and Australia. 

As John Maguire wrote in 1909, &quot;It was then that America greeted the return of the wanderer, proud of the victory of an American actor in an American play in foreign lands. This fame added to the glory of his country, both at home and abroad…&quot; Returning to America, Jefferson made it his stock play, making annual tours of the states with it, and occasionally reviving &quot;The Heir at Law&quot; in which he played Dr. Pangloss, &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; (Caleb Plummer), and &quot;The Rivals&quot; (Bob Acres). He was elected to The Lambs Theatre Club as an Honorary Lifetime member in 1890, and was one of the first to establish the traveling troupes who superseded the old system of local stock companies.

Jefferson also starred in a number of films as the Van Winkle character, starting in the 1896 &quot;Awakening of Rip&quot;. This is held in the U.S. National Film Registry. Jefferson&#x27;s son Thomas followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and played the character in a number of early 20th-century silent films. Joseph Jefferson made several recordings, all of material from &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;.

Jefferson essentially created no new character after 1865, except for minor parts. He was known as a one-part actor. The public never wearied of his one masterpiece. Francis Wilson wrote in 1906, &quot;He was Rip and Rip was he.&quot; Jefferson was rewarded by the theater community with being elected lifetime president of The Players Club. 

In 1869, Jefferson bought a place called Orange Island in New Iberia, Louisiana. There he built a large home. The site is on a peninsula on Lake Peigneur; the peninsula became known as Jefferson Island in his honor. 

Jefferson died from pneumonia on April 23, 1905, at his home in Palm Beach, Florida.

==Legacy==

Jefferson&#x27;s name continues to live on through the Joseph Jefferson Awards Committee in Chicago which offers awards in recognition of excellence of Chicago&#x27;s Equity and non-Equity theaters and their productions. Jefferson Island in Mashpee, Massachusetts, which was once known as Stayonit Island, is named for him.

The Joe Jefferson Players, a theatre playhouse founded in Mobile, Alabama in 1947, took their name from Jefferson.

His former home on Jefferson Island, the Victorian-era Joseph Jefferson Mansion (built 1870) is now listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and is operated via private ownership but is open to the public. Surrounding the home are the Rip Van Winkle Gardens, 20 acres of gardens which were rebuilt in the 1950s through the 1980s and contain a 550 year old oak tree that Grover Cleveland once slept under. His former home in Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, also known as the Joe Jefferson House, is listed on the NRHP. His former property in Saddle River, New Jersey was turned into a fishing club named after him. The Joe Jefferson Clubhouse is listed on the NRHP.

Jefferson&#x27;s son, Thomas (1856–1932), was a noted actor. He occasionally played the Rip Van Winkle character, including in some silent feature films.

Writer Joseph Jefferson Farjeon, son of his daughter Margaret Jefferson (1853–1935), was named after him.

The 1919 silent film &quot;Deliverance&quot;, a biography of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan, includes a scene where the two women visit Jefferson in his dressing room before a performance as Rip Van Winkle. Jefferson&#x27;s son Thomas portrayed his late father.

In &quot;archy and mehitabel&quot;, a tomcat tells of his grandfather, a &quot;theatre cat&quot; who played Joseph Jefferson&#x27;s beard when his prop beard fell off during a performance. This story was used in the musical &quot;archy and mehitabel&quot;, and in the adaptations of that musical into Broadway, television, and animated film.

Jefferson&#x27;s birthplace at Sixth and Spruce Streets in Philadelphia is on the Pennsylvania Register of Historic Places, and a memorial plaque has been placed upon the house.

<doc id="542795" wikidata="Q3568392" url="?curid=542795" title="William Annand">
<text>William Annand (April 10, 1808 – October 12, 1887) was a Nova Scotia publisher and politician. He was a member of the North British Society.

Annand was born in Halifax. He was educated in Scotland and returned to Nova Scotia in the 1820s with his brother with an intention to become a farmer. Annand was first elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1836 and supported demands for responsible government. He lost his seat in 1843 and became proprietor and editor of the &quot;Novascotian&quot; and &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; newspapers. In 1851 he returned to the House of Assembly as member for Halifax County. He was the financial secretary in Joseph Howe&#x27;s ministry from 1860 to 1863 and in 1867 was appointed to the Legislative Council. In July 1866, Annand and Howe headed up a delegation to London in order to lobby against Nova Scotia&#x27;s inclusion in confederation. He became the second premier of Nova Scotia November 7, 1867, on behalf of the Anti-Confederation Party which soon became the Nova Scotia Liberal Party, but he was a weak leader. Annand resigned May 8, 1875 and was replaced three days later by Philip Carteret Hill. Historian David A. Sutherland described him as a &quot;mediocrity&quot; who &quot;possessed neither outstanding ability nor great depth of character.&quot;

Moving to London, he was appointed agent-general representing Canada until 1878 and then was appointed agent general on behalf of the Nova Scotia government serving in that position until the end of his life. He died in London in 1887.

His character was in the television drama &quot;The Night They Killed Joe Howe&quot; (1960), starring Douglas Rain, Austin Willis (as William Annand) and James Doohan, was located in Maitland, Nova Scotia.

<doc id="542797" wikidata="Q1124558" url="?curid=542797" title="Niobrara River">
<text>The Niobrara River (; , , literally &quot;water spread-out horizontal-the&quot; or &quot;The Wide-Spreading Water&quot;) is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately long, running through the U.S. states of Wyoming and Nebraska. The river drains one of the most arid sections of the Great Plains, and has a low flow for a river of its length. The Niobrara&#x27;s watershed includes the northern tier of Nebraska Sandhills, a small south-central section of South Dakota, as well as a small area of eastern Wyoming.

==Course==
The river rises in the High Plains of Wyoming, in southern Niobrara County. The Niobrara flows east as an intermittent stream past Lusk and southeast into northwestern Nebraska. It then flows southeast across the Pine Ridge country of Sioux County, then east through Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, past Marsland, and through Box Butte Reservoir. The stream flows east across northern Nebraska, near the northern edge of the Sandhills and past Valentine. It is joined by the Snake River about southwest of Valentine. In north-central Nebraska it is joined by the Keya Paha River approximately west of Butte. The river joins the Missouri northwest of Niobrara in northern Knox County, just upstream of Lewis and Clark Lake. Its total drainage basin is about .

===Discharge===
Although the annual runoff is low relative to the size of its drainage basin, the Niobrara has a stronger and more consistent flow than many other streams in the region. An estimated 70 percent of the river&#x27;s water results from seepage from the Ogallala Aquifer that underlies the area, with the remaining 30 percent from precipitation. The river is highest in the spring and early summer (February through April) and lowest in early fall (August and September). By late fall, river levels begin to rise as demands for river water for irrigation subside.

The Niobrara&#x27;s average discharge between 1958 and 2013, measured at the U.S. Geological Survey stream gage at Verdel, Nebraska, above the mouth, is . The highest flow recorded was on March 27, 1960. The lowest daily mean was on November 13, 1960.

==History==
The lower Niobrara valley is the traditional home of the Ponca tribe of Native Americans. Between 1861 and 1882, the stretch of the Niobrara River from the mouth of the Keya Paha to its confluence with the Missouri marked the boundary between Nebraska and the Dakota Territory.

===National Scenic River===

A stretch of the Niobrara River in central Nebraska, from the town of Valentine east to Nebraska State Highway 137, has been designated as the Niobrara National Scenic River since 1991. It is managed by the Department of the Interior (U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and National Park Service) to protect the water quality, geologic, paleontologic, fish and wildlife, scenic and recreation values.

Most of the lands within the boundary of the National Scenic River are, and will remain, in private ownership. Management is based upon working with private, county, state and federal landowners and stakeholders to coordinate protection of the river while ensuring a quality experience for river visitors. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service manages the 9 miles of river that flow through the Fort Niobrara Refuge primarily for wilderness and wildlife habitat, but allows recreation downstream from Cornell Dam. The National Park Service manages the remaining 67 miles, acting as a facilitator for resource protection by landowners and river users, providing law enforcement and visitor education services, and coordinating resource management activities.

==River modifications==

The Box Butte Dam, completed in 1946 by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR), is the only major dam on the Niobrara River proper. Located in Dawes County in western Nebraska, the dam is part of the Mirage Flats Project, which irrigates on the north side of the Niobrara River. Dunlap Diversion Dam, below Box Butte, diverts water through a canal to the farmland.

The Snake River tributary is impounded by the Merritt Dam and irrigates about in the area of Valentine, Nebraska. The project is part of the Ainsworth Unit of the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, also operated by the USBR.

Cornell Dam, built in 1915 at the confluence of Minnechaduza Creek near Valentine, generated power until 1985. The following year the dam was acquired by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Although officially decommissioned, the dam remains standing. The feasibility of removing the defunct dam has been studied, although the accumulation of sediment behind the dam, which may include high levels of chemicals from pesticides, may be harmful to the river environment if released.

Spencer Dam, about from the mouth of the Niobrara, was the last operational hydroelectric plant on the river. The dam was built in 1927 and was operated by the Nebraska Public Power District. It includes two Westinghouse generators, with a combined capacity of 3,000 kW. In a 2015 agreement with Nebraska local and state government entities, NPPD agreed to decommission the dam in 2017. The dam was breached by flooding caused by a March 2019 storm.

==Native American languages==
In the Cheyenne language, the river is , meaning &quot;surprise river&quot;; in Pawnee, ; and in Lakota, , meaning &quot;great river&quot;.

<doc id="542803" wikidata="Q272193" url="?curid=542803" title="Æthelhere of East Anglia">
<text>Æthelhere (died 15 November 655) was King of East Anglia from 653 or 654 until his death. He was a member of the ruling Wuffingas dynasty and one of three sons of Eni to rule East Anglia as Christian kings. He was a nephew of Rædwald, who was the first of the Wuffingas of which more than a name is known.

Rædwald and his son Eorpwald both ruled as pagans before being converted to Christianity. After Eorpwald&#x27;s murder in around 627, the East Angles briefly reverted to heathenism, before Christianity was re-established by Sigeberht. Sigeberht eventually abdicated in favour of his co-ruler Ecgric, after which the East Angles were defeated in battle by the Mercians, led by their king Penda, during which both Ecgric and Sigeberht were slain. The monks at Cnobheresburg were driven out by Penda in 651 and Ecgric&#x27;s successor Anna was forced into temporary exile. In 653 Penda once again attacked East Anglia and at the Battle of Bulcamp, Anna and his son were slain and the East Anglian army was defeated. Æthelhere then became king of the East Angles, possibly ruling jointly with his surviving brother, Æthelwold. During Æthelhere&#x27;s brief reign, it is known that Botolph&#x27;s monastery at Iken was built.

In 655, Æthelhere was one of thirty noble warlords who joined with Penda in an invasion of Northumbria, laying siege to Oswiu and the much smaller Northumbrian army. The battle was fought on 15 November 655, near the Winwaed, an unidentified river. The Northumbrians were victorious and many of the Mercians and their allies were killed or drowned. In the battle, Penda and nearly all his warlords, including Æthelhere, were killed.

== Sources ==

In contrast with the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about the Kingdom of the East Angles has survived, as a result of the destruction of the kingdom&#x27;s monasteries and the disappearance of the two East Anglian sees that occurred as the result of Viking raids and settlement. The primary source for information about Æthelhere&#x27;s life and brief reign is the &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; (&quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;), completed in Northumbria by Bede in 732.

== Background ==
After the end of Roman rule in Britain, the region now known as East Anglia was settled by a North Germanic group known as the Angles, although there is evidence of early settlement of the region by a minority of other peoples, for instance the Swabians, who settled in the area around the modern town of Swaffham. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the territories of southern Britain conquered by the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. The ruling dynasty of East Anglia was the Wuffingas, named from Wuffa, an early king. The first king known to have ruled is Rædwald, whose reign spanned a quarter of a century from about 599.

Æthelhere was probably the second of the sons of Eni, the brother of Rædwald. Four sons are certainly known: Æthilric, the father of Ealdwulf, Anna, Æthelhere and Æthelwold, his successor. The brothers all appear to have been firmly committed to Christian rule: Æthilric married the Christian Hereswith, the great-niece of Edwin of Northumbria. Anna is described by Bede as almost a saintly figure and the father of a most religious family, who brought about the conversion of Cenwalh of Wessex, and Æthelwold was the sponsor of Swithelm of Essex during his baptism.

Æthelhere witnessed the fortunes of his dynasty during the years of Rædwald&#x27;s rule and afterwards. The East Angles under Rædwald had been converted to Christianity, but in around 627, during the reign of his son Eorpwald, they reverted to heathenism. This occurred after Eorpwald was killed by a pagan soon after his succession and baptism. The assassin, Ricberht, may then have ruled the kingdom for a few years, to be succeeded by Sigeberht, who re-established Christianity in the kingdom and became the first East Anglian king to act as a patron of the Church.

== Mercian destabilisation of the East Angles ==

Sigeberht abdicated in favour of his co-ruler Ecgric and retired to lead a monastic life, but soon afterwards the East Angles were attacked by Mercian forces, led by their king, Penda. Ecgric and his army appealed to Sigeberht to lead them into battle against the Mercians, but he refused to participate. He was dragged from his monastery to the battlefield, where, still refusing to bear arms or fight, he and Ecgric were slain and the defeated East Anglian army was destroyed.

Ecgric&#x27;s successor, Anna, acted as a challenge to the increasing power of Penda throughout his reign. In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda&#x27;s sister, Penda drove him from his kingdom and into exile. Anna was strong enough to offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh&#x27;s return to his throne.

During the late 640s, the Irish monk Fursey, having spent a year as a hermit, left East Anglia for Gaul. His monastery at Cnobheresburg (identified by some with Burgh Castle) was left in the hands of his half-brother, Foillan. In 651, shortly after his departure, the heathen threat he had foreseen became a reality, when Foillan and his community were driven out by Penda&#x27;s forces and Anna, who encountered Penda at Cnobheresburg, was exiled.

== Reign ==

In 653 or early 654, after Anna had returned from exile, Penda was able to direct a military assault upon the East Angles. The Mercian and East Anglian armies fought at Bulcamp (near Blythburgh in Suffolk), where Anna and his son were slain and the East Anglian army was slaughtered in large numbers. Æthelhere then succeeded his brother as Penda&#x27;s client-king, although Barbara Yorke has suggested that Æthelhere and his surviving brother Æthelwold may have reigned jointly, as Bede separately refers to both men as Anna&#x27;s successor.

Æthelhere&#x27;s short reign, during which Brigilsus remained bishop of the see of Dommoc, witnessed the construction of Botolph&#x27;s monastery at Iken. The site lay within the sphere of Rendlesham and Sutton Hoo. Æthelhere would have arranged his brother&#x27;s funeral, whose reputed burial-site was at Blythburgh.

== Battle of the Winwæd ==

During 655, Æthelhere joined with Penda in an assault on Northumbria. Steven Plunkett asserts that Æthelhere&#x27;s motive for changing sides was to deflect Penda&#x27;s attention from East Anglia and the destruction of his kingdom that would have ensued. Penda invaded Northumbria with a force of thirty &quot;duces regii&quot; (or royal commanders) under his command that included a large contingent of Britons. He laid siege to Oswiu at Maes Gai, in the district of Loidis, which was probably at that time within the sphere of influence of the British kingdom of Rheged. Oswiu offered him a great ransom of treasure which, according to Bede, was refused (or according to the Historia Brittonum, was accepted and distributed) — in either case Penda resolved on battle and the destruction of the Northumbrians. Oswiu had a much smaller force, but in the event the Welsh armies of King Cadfæl of Gwynedd decamped on the eve of battle and Penda&#x27;s ally Œthelwald of Deira stood aside to await the outcome.

The &quot;major setpiece battle&quot;, according to Barbara Yorke, was fought on 15 November 655, on the banks of the River Winwæd, the location of which has not been identified. The waters of the Winwæd were in spate owing to heavy rains and had flooded the land. The Northumbrians were victorious, the Mercian forces were slaughtered and many of them drowned in flight. Penda himself was killed, together with nearly all his allies, including Æthelhere of East Anglia, who was leading the East Anglian part of the forces ranged against Oswiu:

Although the passage from Bede suggests that Æthelhere was the cause of the war—&quot;auctor ipse belli&quot;—it has been argued that an issue of punctuation in later manuscripts confused Bede&#x27;s meaning on this point, and that he in fact meant to refer to Penda as being responsible for the war. According to the 12th century &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;, the deaths of five Anglo-Saxon kings were avenged:

<doc id="542820" wikidata="Q173636" url="?curid=542820" title="Tyrrell P34">
<text>The Tyrrell P34 (Project 34), commonly known as the &quot;six-wheeler&quot;, was a Formula One (F1) race car designed by Derek Gardner, Tyrrell&#x27;s chief designer. The car used four specially manufactured 10-inch diameter (254 mm) wheels and tyres at the front, with two ordinary-sized wheels at the back. Along with the Brabham BT46B &quot;fancar&quot; developed in , the six-wheeled Tyrrell was one of the most radical entries ever to succeed in F1 competition and has been called the most recognisable design in the history of world motorsports.

The P34 was introduced in September 1975 and began racing in the 1976 season. It proved successful and led other teams to begin design of six-wheeled platforms of their own. Changes to the design made for the 1977 season made it uncompetitive and the concept was abandoned for Tyrrell&#x27;s 1978 season. The other six-wheeled designs ended development and F1 rules later stipulated that cars must have four wheels in total. The cars later had some success in various &quot;classics&quot; race events, but today are museum pieces.

==Design==
For the mid-1970s, F1 stipulated that the maximum width of the front wing was 1.5 m. Considering the needed room for the driver&#x27;s feet, the steering mechanism, suspension and the normal front tyre size, this meant the front tyres projected above and out to the sides of the wing. P34&#x27;s basic concept was to use a tyre that would be small enough to fit entirely behind the wing. This would have two effects; one would be to lower overall drag and thus improve speed on straights and the other was to clean up overall aerodynamics so the rear wing would receive cleaner airflow.

However, given the space limitations, such a tyre would have to be quite small; in the final design it was in diameter. This had too small a contact patch to offer reasonable cornering performance, which led to the use of four wheels instead of two. Adding more wheels also had the advantage of offering more total brake area. The downside was increased complexity of the steering system and a physically larger suspension system. The steering complexity was solved by connecting only the front pair of wheels to the steering wheel and connecting the rear set to the front with a bell crank. Initially considered to be a problem area, Joel Rosinsky later declared that &quot;The steering is so gentle and absolutely free of reaction that you might have thought it was power-assisted!&quot;

The new design was unveiled at the Heathrow Hotel in late September 1975. The car was initially kept under a tarpaulin with hoops over the wheels to make it look conventional, leading to astonishment when the tarp was pulled off. Some in the audience were convinced the design was a publicity stunt. The car first took to the track at Silverstone on 8 October 1975, and, after more tests, Tyrrell decided to build two more examples with a slightly longer wheelbase to race in the 1976 season.

==Race history==


===1976===
The stretched versions first ran in the Spanish GP in and proved to be very competitive. Both Jody Scheckter and Patrick Depailler produced good results with the car, but while Depailler praised the car continually, Scheckter was unimpressed. The P34&#x27;s golden moment came in the Swedish Grand Prix. Scheckter and Depailler finished first and second, and to date Scheckter is the only driver ever to win a race in a six-wheeled car. The car seemed to be particularly good down the straights and through long corners, like at Anderstorp, Watkins Glen, Mosport Park, Fuji and the Österreichring, but it struggled on bumpy circuits like Brands Hatch, Jarama and the Nürburgring, where the grip was actually variable, because, depending upon the contours or bumps on the track, one of the front small tires would touch the road, but the one in front or behind it on the same side would not. Scheckter left the team at the end of the season, insisting that the six-wheeler was &quot;a piece of junk&quot;.

===1977===
For 1977, Scheckter was replaced by Ronnie Peterson, and the P34 was redesigned for cleaner aerodynamics, and some redesign was done on Peterson&#x27;s car to accommodate his height. The P34B was wider and heavier than before, and, although Peterson was able to string some promising results from the P34B, as was Depailler, it was clear the car was not as good as before. Tyrrell blamed the problems on the increased weight, now over the F1 minimum. This placed more strain on the brakes and made it struggle through the corners. Others have blamed Goodyear&#x27;s failure to properly develop the small front tyres. Late in the season, an attempt to address the handling was made by increasing the track of the front suspension, but this moved the tyres out from their original hidden position, essentially eliminating the whole advantage of the concept.

In November 1977, Tyrrell introduced his car for the 1978 season, and it had a conventional layout. He commented, &quot;In the meantime, we have closed the book on our six-wheeled project, and I am sure the cars will become something of a collector&#x27;s piece&quot;. Tyrrell kept the frame that Scheckter won on and sold the rest.

==Post F1==
More recently, the P34 has been a popular sight at historic racing events, proving competitive once more. This was made possible when the Avon tyre company agreed to manufacture bespoke 10-inch tyres for Simon Bull, the owner of chassis No. 6. In 1999 and 2000, the resurrected P34 competed at a number of British and European circuits as an entrant in the FIA Thoroughbred Grand Prix series. Driven by Martin Stretton, the car won the TGP series outright in 2000, Chassis No.5 repeating that success in 2008 in the hands of Mauro Pane; this example is now owned by Pierluigi Martini alongside chassis number 2. Stretton also achieved numerous pole positions and class wins at the Grand Prix Historique de Monaco. The P34 has also been seen a number of times at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

==Other six-wheeled Formula One cars==
While the Tyrrell P34 is the most widely known six-wheeled F1 car, it was not the only one. The March Engineering, Williams and Scuderia Ferrari teams also built experimental six-wheeled F1 chassis; however, all of these had four wheels at the back rather than at the front like the P34. The Williams FW07D and FW08B, and the March 2-4-0, had tandem rear wheels, which reduced drag by using the smaller front wheels and tyres in place of the typical larger rear wheels. The Ferrari 312T6 featured the four rear wheels on a single axle. This was similar to how Auto Union increased traction with its Type-D Grand Prix cars in the 1930s. Despite extensive testing, neither the March, Williams, nor the Ferrari, were ever raced. In 1983, the FIA prohibited cars with four driven wheels from competing. Later, the Formula 1 regulations required four as the maximum number of wheels allowed.

==In media==
The Tyrrell P34 was featured in the cartoon &quot;The Transformers&quot; as the vehicle converted into the Decepticon Stunticon known as Drag Strip. The car, shown sporting a yellow livery with red accents, was depicted as still being active in automotive races, despite the fact that the episode wherein it was stolen was produced and set in the mid-eighties.

The race car also made an appearance in the first episode of the 1993 anime series &quot;Moldiver&quot; and the 2013 film &quot;Rush&quot;.

Lupin is seen racing a version of the car in season 1 episode 11 of &quot;Lupin the Third Part II&quot; - &quot;Bet on the Monaco Grand Prix (Who&#x27;s Vroomin Who?)&quot;.

In season 4 of &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, a car inspired by the Tyrell P34 is used in the episode &quot;Live and Let Drive&quot; by Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz.

==Die-cast toys and model kits==
Several die-cast and model kit manufacturers were made a replica of the P34:

• 1/64 scale die-cast models were made by Mini GT and Hot Wheels.

• A 1/43 scale model was made by Minichamps.

• 1/20 scale and larger 1/12 scale model kits based on the different specifications were made by Tamiya. A 1/10 scale remote controlled model car is also available.

<doc id="542833" wikidata="Q7857147" url="?curid=542833" title="Tuvix">
<text>&quot;Tuvix&quot; is the 40th episode (24th in the second season) of the science fiction television program &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. The episode originally aired on May 6, 1996, and tells the story of Tuvok and Neelix being merged into a unique third character named Tuvix.

The episode was substantially rewritten from its original iteration as a lighthearted story to a more somber tale with serious moral and ethical implications. Tom Wright guest stars as Tuvix to lend more credence to a unique new character that consists of equal parts Tuvok and Neelix. Both director Cliff Bole and Wright himself had reservations about the latter&#x27;s take on the character, and despite a perceived lack of support, Wright still praised the &quot;Voyager&quot; cast and crew. Both the story and performances of &quot;Tuvix&quot; were lauded by the production team and critics alike.

&quot;Tuvix&quot; was well received by fans and critics, earning generally positive reviews. Researchers and critics found &quot;Tuvix&quot; teeming with technical and philosophical content, including thematic ties to other episodes in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon, real-world logical and metaphysical ramifications, and scientific concessions for the story.

==Plot==
On stardate 49655.2, Lieutenant Tuvok (Tim Russ) and Neelix (Ethan Phillips) are sent to collect botanical samples from a class-M planet. When beamed back aboard , the two men and the Orchidaceae they collected are merged at the molecular level to become a single lifeform which names himself Tuvix (Wright). After ruling out transporter malfunction, the crew discovers that when demolecularized, the genetic material of the alien orchids acted as a symbiogenetic catalyst and is the culprit for the combination of the two crewmembers. Unfortunately, the process cannot be reversed, and Tuvix is accepted as a member of the crew with the rank of lieutenant, functioning as chief tactical officer in Tuvok&#x27;s stead.

Kes (Jennifer Lien) reacts poorly to Tuvix as his existence deprives her of both Tuvok and Neelix, her mentor and boyfriend respectively. Her displeasure lessens over the course of the episode, but never completely goes away. Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) accepts Tuvix in his role as an excellent chief tactical officer and &quot;an able advisor, who skillfully uses humor to make his points&quot;. Tuvix himself, having the combined memories and personalities of his constituents, melds the previously intractable qualities of both and improves upon them, flexing either muscle as the situation requires: &quot;Chief of security or head chef, take your pick!&quot;

Two weeks after the accident, the Doctor (Robert Picardo) develops a contemporary equivalent to barium sulfate radiocontrasting using a custom radioisotope with which he can identify the disparate DNA of the two original crewmen and use the transporter to disentangle them. However, Tuvix denounces the procedure; he argues that he has rights and to restore the two lost crewmen would require his execution. After discussing the situation with Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), Kes, and Tuvix himself, Janeway ultimately decides to proceed with the separation, acting &quot;in absentia&quot; to protect the rights of the two constituent men. Tuvix makes a final emotive plea for support from the crew, but finds no supporters. After the Doctor refuses to take Tuvix&#x27;s life in compliance with the medical precept of doing no harm, Janeway performs the procedure herself and succeeds in restoring both Tuvok and Neelix.

==Production==
Wendy Neuss, Merri D. Howard, Kenneth Biller, Peter Lauritson, and Brannon Braga were all credited as producers on &quot;Tuvix&quot;, while Jay Chattaway was credited with the music and Marvin V. Rush was the cinematographer. Daryl Baskin edited the episode to its 46-minute runtime.

===Writing===

During its development, &quot;Tuvix&quot; was previously known as &quot;Untitled Tuvok/Neelix&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, and &quot;Symbiogenesis&quot;, with the third of these persisting through the episode&#x27;s development and shooting. The episode and its teleplay were written by Kenneth Biller; the story is credited to Andrew Shepard Price and Mark Gaberman, for which they earned . Though described by Biller as &quot;high-concept&quot;, the original story by Price and Gaberman was much more light-hearted and tended towards slapstick. Biller and Braga found the tone of the episode was so akin to a 1960s sitcom, the two of them even wrote a theme song for it: &quot;It&#x27;s Tuvok, it&#x27;s Neelix! It&#x27;s two guys, in-a-fix! It&#x27;s Tuuuuvix!&quot; Biller re-wrote the episode to focus more on the serious philosophical questions raised by the episode and especially the inevitable separation of Tuvix back into the series regulars. In Biller&#x27;s original treatment, Tuvix recognized that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and consented to his fissure. However, after a discussion with executive producer Michael Piller, Biller began to at the audience&quot; by throwing up roadblocks to the episode&#x27;s foregone conclusion; first Tuvix was re-written to object to the procedure, and then the Doctor&#x27;s refusal was added to force Captain Janeway to put truth to action. Piller later described Biller as &quot;the poet laureate of &quot;Star Trek&quot;&quot;, highlighting his work on &quot;Tuvix&quot; and &quot;Lifesigns&quot; as examples.

===Filming===
Tom Wright described working on &quot;Tuvix&quot; as an exercise in forcing himself to work outside his known comfort areas and confessed he was unsure of the quality of the end product. The actor complained about what he saw as a lack of support and guidance from the &quot;Voyager&quot; team, saying he felt adrift and unsure as to what was expected of his performance, especially since his portrayal reflected two of the starring characters. However, he also conceded that it may have been intentional in an effort to evoke a genuine sense of off-balancedness in the character. Either way, though he was unaccustomed to the environment, Wright expressed his willingness to revisit Tuvix or even work on any &quot;Star Trek&quot; again if the opportunity arose. In interviews, Wright specifically fondly recalled his time working with Jennifer Lien (Kes), Kate Mulgrew (Captain Janeway), and director Cliff Bole.

In a 1997 interview, Wright explained how the episode&#x27;s dialogue posed a challenge in that not only did he have to take great care to adhere to the vernacular of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and not sound too contemporary or &quot;too 1997&quot;, but he had to take several days to accommodate himself to the episode&#x27;s &quot;treknobabble&quot; with the assistance of Robert Duncan McNeill (Tom Paris). Bole later praised Wright for his ability to improvise, but explained that it was to the actor&#x27;s detriment as &quot;&quot;Star Trek&quot; is &quot;not&quot; an ad-lib format&quot;, and he felt Wright assumed he could wing some of it. Mulgrew also bemoaned the technobabble in &quot;Tuvix&quot; when asked by &quot;Starlog&quot; for her most memorable line thereof; &quot;When did he cease to be a transporter accident and start to be an individual?&quot;
Bole heaped praise on the episode&#x27;s final scene in which Janeway &quot;stalks&quot; into the corridor outside sickbay after performing the procedure which restores Tuvok and Neelix. He extolled, &quot;That last shot I did with Kate [Mulgrew], as she&#x27;s walking into the camera, she told the whole story with her face. She gave a great performance. I only asked for a few things; she brought that look and emotion to work with her.&quot; In his book &quot;The Meaning of Star Trek&quot;, author Thomas Richards also credited Mulgrew in this scene. Richards saw Janeway troubled by her difficult decision between two undesirable options and how &quot;she must live with the choice. [A] death has cast a shadow over the ship, and for the first time in the series the Federation has put to death one of its own.&quot;

In a 1996 interview, Robert Picardo reminisced that as the Doctor he had &quot;a substantial amount&quot; to do in &quot;Tuvix&quot;. Picardo would also look back on the episode, and the scene in which he &quot;countermand[s] the captain&quot; especially, as a turning point in the Doctor&#x27;s and Janeway&#x27;s relationship, calling it an &quot;interesting moment for both characters&quot;. Ethan Phillips also remembered being excited reading the script for &quot;Tuvix&quot;, as it was an opportunity to discover more about his character.

The science lab set in the first act is a redress of the isolation chamber in sickbay, but with a blue background as opposed to the yellow.

==Casting==
In addition to Tom Wright as Tuvix, guest stars included Simon Billig as Hogan and Bahni Turpin as Swinn. Casting for &quot;Tuvix&quot; was done by Junie Lowry-Johnson, C.S.A., and Ron Surma.

===Tuvix===
Director Cliff Bole and the episode&#x27;s producers originally considered having series regular Ethan Phillips (Neelix) portray Tuvix, but decided against it, fearing that he was too identifiable and would have difficulty integrating an equal amount of the Tuvok character into his performance.
The only non-recurring guest star in &quot;Tuvix&quot; is the eponymous fusion of two main characters. Though guest stars have occasionally played major recurring characters—&quot;e.g.&quot; Sandra Smith as Captain Kirk in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; &quot;Turnabout Intruder&quot; and David Birkin as Captain Picard in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; &quot;Rascals&quot;—Tom Wright is the first to portray two in the same episode.

When contacted by his talent agent, Wright jumped at the opportunity to create a character wholly unique to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. When he auditioned for the role of Tuvix, Wright had never seen &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and was completely unfamiliar with the characterizations of Tuvok and Neelix. Instead, he drew upon his prior experiences with the characters&#x27; actors, Tim Russ and Ethan Phillips respectively, to successfully vie for the role. Executive producer Jeri Taylor was pleased with the casting of Wright, marveling at his ability to bring credibility to the prospect of two characters in one.

After securing the role, Wright was provided video of Tuvok and Neelix from previous episodes from which he refined the character. Instead of portraying Tuvix as simply a vessel for two separate consciousnesses, Wright blended the two characters to form a unique third. Wright focused on juxtaposing the contrary physical and emotional natures of the two characters in his performance; in scenes where Neelix&#x27;s persona is more prominent, Wright played up Tuvok&#x27;s composed physicality, and in scenes where Tuvok&#x27;s skills and experience were needed, Wright leaned more heavily on Neelix&#x27;s exuberant mannerisms. Wright also worked hard to exhibit the intrinsic warmth of both characters and make Tuvix as likable and sympathetic a character as possible. Author David McIntee (&quot;Delta Quadrant&quot;) felt that Tuvix expressed more of Neelix&#x27;s mannerisms than Tuvok&#x27;s. He also noted that Tuvix adopted Neelix&#x27;s right-handedness as opposed to Tuvok&#x27;s left-handedness.

====Costuming and makeup====

McIntee hypothesizes that the modified Starfleet uniform Tuvix initially wears after his creation was influenced by the orchids which were also transported. He called it &quot;an illogical but subtle and attractive stylistic touch&quot; and praised its design suggesting they all be modified duly. Robert Blackman served as costume designer for &quot;Tuvix&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;The Official Star Trek Voyager Magazine&quot; in 1998, director Cliff Bole spoke highly of guest star Tom Wright, saying he was a &quot;good actor [who] prides himself on being Shakespearian&quot;, but felt that he was in over his head working on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, particularly underestimating the rigors of working under the requisite makeup. Bole detailed a four-hour, process to apply the glue, mask, and prostheses before the actor even began delivering his lines for what was an all-day shoot; all of these &quot;subtract from [the] performance&quot; of actors unaccustomed to them. Bole tempered himself explaining that he had seen &quot;really competent actors&quot; suffer from the same trials and simple exhaustion that he saw in Wright&#x27;s performance. For his part, Wright compared the trials of the &quot;heavy makeup&quot; and contact lenses required to play Tuvix with his previous roles on &quot;Creepshow 2&quot; and &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;. Tuvix&#x27;s makeup was designed and supervised by Michael Westmore. Despite the obfuscation of Wright&#x27;s face, he was still recognized by fans on the street 25 years later.

==Analysis==
Elaine Graham&#x27;s book &quot;Representations of the Post/Human&quot; uses &quot;Tuvix&quot; to contrast &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; with &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;; &quot;Tuvix&quot; is an example of how the former series tended to incorporate stories that touched on moral and ethically ambiguous situations and decisions. Graham notes how the character of Tuvix was written to encourage audience sympathies, yet was still effectively sentenced to death in contravention of what she describes as the &quot;exemplary &quot;Star Trek&quot; values [of] sentience, self-determination, and personhood&quot;. Thomas Richards&#x27; &quot;The Meaning of Star Trek&quot; also focused on the morality of decisions in &quot;Tuvix&quot; as compared to the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;The Next Generation&quot;; more than &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, the is far from the United Federation of Planets and &quot;must address every value of the Federation [...] in a universe in which those values may no longer apply.&quot; Richards describes the episode as &quot;truly remarkable&quot; for its depiction of Janeway&#x27;s sentence of capital punishment and her performing the very first execution in all of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Not only is this shocking for the audience in comparison to episodes and series past, but even the fictional &quot;Voyager&quot; crew are stunned. In 2000, David McIntee pointed to these themes and plot points as having made &quot;Tuvix&quot; the most debated episode in &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom yet, and one of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; &quot;most thought-provoking, and [...] single most discussed, episode.&quot;

In her book &quot;American Science Fiction TV&quot;, Jan Johnson-Smith noted that &quot;Tuvix&quot; is one of a recurring type of &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes concerned with issues of individuality and self. She thematically tied this episode to &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;″ episode &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; where the transporter rends Captain Kirk into two separate representations of his psyche, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; character of Jadzia Dax who is of a conjoined species (Trill) that repeatedly goes through a conjoining process when the host organism dies, and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Faces&quot; where hybrid Human/Klingon character B&#x27;Elanna Torres is split along her bloodline into two separate species. When asked regarding accusations of &quot;Tuvix&quot; and other &quot;Voyager&quot; episodes simply aping previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; series in this way, executive producer Michael Piller called out &quot;Time&quot; for their comments on the matter before conceding, got to keep new people coming in and pitching because otherwise you&#x27;re going to be retreading an old ground.&quot; Seven years later, when writing &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; &quot;Similitude&quot;, Manny Coto took pains to write that episode dissimilarly to &quot;Tuvix&quot;.

In his paper published in the &quot;Polish Journal of Philosophy&quot;, University of Sussex professor Murali Ramachandran examines the combination of Tuvok and Neelix into a single individual for its implications to modal logic. Ramachandran, though forced to disregard the metaphysical considerations imposed by &quot;the very nature of tele-transportation&quot;, promotes a &quot;Kripkean counterpart theory&quot; using this study of the characters.
Athena Andreadis&#x27; book &quot;To Seek Out New Life: The Biology of Star Trek&quot; attempts and fails to legitimize the episode&#x27;s biologic science, even accepting all other technologies presented. Not only does the synthesis of Tuvok and Neelix violate the law of conservation of mass, but the separation poses the problem of differentiating the two species&#x27; genes, a significant hurdle when science of the 1990s couldn&#x27;t differentiate between humans and chimpanzees. After detailing the combination of the Talaxian and Vulcan species, the cellular chromosomal pairing, and the &quot;synaptic coherence of two brains/minds within one skull&quot;, Andreadis finds the whole proposition laughable from a scientific standpoint, comparing it to the 1986 film &quot;The Fly&quot; as an example of bad science. Ultimately, she comes down against the transporter regarding its fictional capacity to do that which is claimed.

===Tuvix (character)===
Tom Wright spoke on his interpretation of the character in 1997: he felt the two constituent halves of Tuvix &quot;represent[ed] the left and the right side of the brain—where one is weak the other is strong, and vice versa.&quot;

In his 2005 book, &quot;Teleportation: The Impossible Leap&quot;, David J. Darling notes that while Tuvix was well-liked by other characters, his fate was in fact ultimately determined not by his arguments or the decision of the captain, but by the &quot;[e]nsemble casting and contractual arrangements&quot; of the show. Wright also felt the separation of Tuvix was inevitable from a perspective of dramatic necessity. A UPN promotional video for the episode played on expectations of the audience to like Tuvix at the cost of the Tuvok and Neelix characters.

Over 25 years after the episode first aired, the character of Tuvix continued to be a hot-button topic, not only because the character was well-liked, but because of Janeway&#x27;s decision. John Van Citters was ViacomCBS&#x27; vice president of franchise planning and &quot;Star Trek&quot; brand development, and in his many discussions with franchise artists and fans, Tuvix continued to be &quot;over-indexed for a character that’s only made one appearance.&quot; &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; showrunner Mike McMahan described the character and his fate as a touchstone for &quot;Deep Lore Trekkie[s]&quot;. &quot;Voyager&quot; novelist Kirsten Beyer defended Janeway&#x27;s decision as one of two terrible choices. Mohamed Noor wouldn&#x27;t agree with her decision while unable to call it irrational or immoral. US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez skirted the debate, saying, &quot;One thing I learned watching Janeway growing up is how leadership means being responsible for working through dilemmas w/ no clear answers.&quot;

Tuvix was never mentioned again during &quot;Voyager&quot; remaining five seasons.

==Reception==
Writer Kenneth Biller said that he received a &quot;lot of mail&quot; regarding &quot;Tuvix&quot; and that Janeway&#x27;s tough decisions in the episode generated a lot of discussion and really moved a lot of people. Director Cliff Bole felt the episode was &quot;well-accepted&quot;, and both he and the producers liked it. Actor Tom Wright explained the episode&#x27;s popularity saying it resounded with viewers because it had no outright moralizations or specific good and evil characters; the episode deals with a no-win scenario. Writer Thomas Richards concurred with Wright in agreeing that the episode&#x27;s frank depiction without any judgments was a significant strength in its favor. In a March 2023 episode of &quot;The Ready Room&quot;, Tim Russ called &quot;Tuvix&quot; one of the show&#x27;s most controversial episodes, telling Wil Wheaton that in the preceding few years, fans had begun consistently asking him about it.

Nikki Harper for &quot;STAR TREK: The Official Monthly Magazine&quot; gave the episode four out of five stars, &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; Dale Kutzera gave &quot;Tuvix&quot; three out of four stars, and Bill Florence for &quot;The Official Star Trek Voyager Magazine&quot; called it one of &quot;Voyager&quot; &quot;strongest episodes to date&quot;. In his book &quot;Delta Quadrant: The unofficial guide to&quot; Voyager, David McIntee was impressed by the episode&#x27;s capacity to rise above its &quot;appallingly silly&quot; premise; he attributed this to the casting of Tom Wright as Tuvix, whose acting he saw as a guide to the tempo of the episode, keeping it from proceeding too slowly. He gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating.

&quot;Wired&quot; magazine criticized the episode, saying that although the episode might have seemed like a great concept, it failed in practice and was &quot;an awkward, embarrassing mess that fails to land any of the deeper points it so desperately wants to make.&quot; Writing for &quot;Tor.com&quot; in 2020, Keith DeCandido &quot;[admired] the execution of most of this episode&quot; and praised the &quot;amazing work&quot; of Wright, Mulgrew, and Lien, but was frustrated that Janeway&#x27;s actions had no consequences. He rated the episode 4 out of 10. After considering the discussion generated in the comments underneath his review, he later acknowledged how the episode&#x27;s moral dilemma generated significant conversation among the fanbase when it first aired, and continued to do so 25 years later.

In 2014, &quot;io9&quot; Charlie Jane Anders ranked &quot;Tuvix&quot; 56th of the top 100 episodes of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In 2015, Syfy&#x27;s Lisa Granshaw placed &quot;Tuvix&quot; among &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; top ten.

<doc id="542835" wikidata="Q35546" url="?curid=542835" title="Montreal Screwjob">
<text>The Montreal Screwjob (also called the Montreal Incident) was a notorious unscripted professional wrestling incident that occurred on November 9, 1997, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. During the WWF Championship match between Shawn Michaels and champion Bret Hart, WWF owner Vince McMahon and select WWF employees covertly manipulated the predetermined outcome of the match in favor of Michaels; the screwjob occurred without Hart&#x27;s knowledge, causing him to lose the championship. Since this event, the term &quot;screwjob&quot; has come into common parlance. 

Hart had been WWF Champion since August 1997. A week prior to Survivor Series, Hart, who had performed for the WWF since 1984, agreed to join rival wrestling promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from December 1997. McMahon sought to prevent Hart from leaving the WWF as champion, but Hart was unwilling to lose to Michaels – with whom he had a legitimate feud – at Survivor Series, as it was taking place in his home country of Canada. The match was planned to end in disqualification, causing Hart to retain the title, and then losing or forfeiting it at a later date. Instead, under McMahon&#x27;s direction, referee Earl Hebner ended the match as Michaels held Hart in the sharpshooter submission hold (Hart&#x27;s signature move); although Hart did not submit, Michaels was declared the winner by submission and became WWF Champion.

As a result of the screwjob, McMahon and Michaels elicited angry responses from Canadian audiences and others for many years. McMahon was viewed by many fans to have betrayed Hart, who was one of the WWF&#x27;s longest-tenured and most popular performers at the time. The screwjob impacted the professional wrestling industry in several ways; according to WWE, the incident is considered as one of the beginnings of the Attitude Era, while GiveMeSport notes the event is generally considered the end of the New Generation Era. This shift led to McMahon featuring as a villainous on-screen character on WWF television broadcasts, and has been used as a theme in matches and storylines across the wrestling industry. It was also partly chronicled in the documentary film &quot;Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows&quot; (1998).

The Montreal Screwjob has garnered a notorious legacy; accounts differ as to who exactly was involved in the plan and the extent of their involvement, while some wrestling fans, performers and bookers believe the incident was an elaborate work executed in collaboration with Hart, which he denies. Hart did not return to the WWE until his induction into the WWE Hall of Fame in April 2006, and he made his next live appearance on WWE programming in January 2010. Hart later said he legitimately reconciled with McMahon and Michaels, and the screwjob was used in a storyline between McMahon and Hart, leading to a match at WrestleMania XXVI in March 2010. Longtime industry writer Mike Johnson referred to the screwjob as &quot;arguably the most talked-about [event] in the history of professional wrestling&quot;.

==Hart&#x27;s departure from the WWF==

At the time of the screwjob, Bret Hart was a 14-year veteran of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), having got his first break in the promotion in the 1980s as one-half of the Hart Foundation tag team with his brother-in-law Jim Neidhart and manager Jimmy Hart. After the team had two reigns as the WWF Tag Team Champions – splitting from Jimmy Hart and becoming heroes between reigns – Hart then achieved tremendous success as a singles performer in the 1990s, twice taking the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, and then winning the WWF Championship five times. Between his third and fourth reigns, Hart took a seven-month leave of absence from the company after WrestleMania XII, during which he considered contract offers from both the WWF and its rival, World Championship Wrestling (WCW). In October 1996, Hart declined a three-year, $8.4 million offer from WCW, instead opting to sign an unprecedented 20-year deal offered by Vince McMahon, which promised to make him the highest-paid wrestler in the WWF and secure him a major role with WWF management following his retirement. Both Hart and the WWF saw the contract as an expression of mutual loyalty.

By mid-1997, however, the WWF was facing financial difficulties due to stiff competition from WCW, which had become the largest professional wrestling promotion in the United States. At the same time, McMahon was planning to make the WWF a publicly traded company (even though the WWF would not go public until 1999), a move which required him to minimize any long-term financial commitments.

For several months prior to the 1997 Survivor Series, Hart and Shawn Michaels had several backstage arguments, culminating in a fight before a &quot;WWF Raw&quot; event in Hartford, Connecticut (after Michaels had publicly accused Hart of having an affair with Sunny) that saw Michaels go home for two months. After a show in San Jose, California, on October 12, 1997, Hart claimed he spoke to Michaels about being professional and trusting one another in the ring; Hart allegedly said he would have no problem losing to Michaels if McMahon requested. He also claimed that when Michaels replied that he &quot;would not be willing to do the same&quot; to Hart, Hart was shocked and became angry. This led to Hart&#x27;s outright refusal to lose the WWF Championship to Michaels at the pay-per-view event in Montreal, although in Hart&#x27;s documentary, Hart states to McMahon that he would happily drop the belt, but not in Canada. However, in his own autobiography, Michaels rejected Hart&#x27;s claim, saying that he would have cleanly lost to Hart had storylines demanded so (though others, including Jim Cornette in various shoot interviews, have often denied this, saying that they knew first-hand that Michaels had no intention of losing cleanly to Hart). Michaels also pointed out that he had lost cleanly to Hart several times in the past, most notably in the WWF&#x27;s first ever ladder match at a &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot; taping on July 21, 1992, which would subsequently be made available on multiple Coliseum/WWE Home Video releases, and in the main event of the 1992 Survivor Series. Michaels also lost to Hart in a Steel Cage match in December 1993.

McMahon believed he made the right choice in pressing Hart to return, which kept him from joining WCW in 1996. However, by September 22, 1997, the WWF&#x27;s monetary problems were at an all-time high. McMahon began to defer payments to Hart, claiming that the WWF was in &quot;financial peril.&quot; At this time, McMahon reviewed the WWF&#x27;s plans for the future, and saw the likes of Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Undertaker, and D-Generation X (DX) leading what was to become &quot;The Attitude Era&quot;. WWF&#x27;s plans did not include Hart; McMahon therefore encouraged Hart to reopen negotiations with WCW.

While Hart considered an offer from then-WCW President Eric Bischoff, McMahon informed Hart that the WWF would honor his contract if he chose to stay. But, when Hart talked to McMahon about future plans and storylines, he was disappointed by McMahon&#x27;s response and what he considered lackluster suggestions. At the time, Hart felt as though his career had been sabotaged by changes to his character, which had been retooled as an anti-America Canadian nationalist; as a result, he drew significant ire from American audiences, but remained a hero in his native Canada, as well as throughout Europe. As a result, he was neither a hero nor a villain, and as such could not be properly placed into feuds with other wrestlers with more concrete personas. Hart had also been unhappy about McMahon&#x27;s move towards more controversial subject matter, which would become a staple of the company&#x27;s product during the Attitude Era.

Convinced that McMahon&#x27;s future plans did not include him, Hart resigned from the WWF and signed an agreement with WCW, which had just offered him a large $3 million per annum contract on November 1, 1997. Hart&#x27;s signing the WCW deal caused McMahon to worry about the possibility of Hart entering WCW while still WWF Champion. Hart asked McMahon if he would be mocked after leaving for WCW, as had occurred with other wrestlers who had transferred to WCW from the WWF (for example, Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage going by the names of &quot;The Huckster&quot; and &quot;The Nacho Man&quot; respectively in the &quot;Billionaire Ted&quot; sketches of early 1996, as well as having Rick Bognar and Glenn Jacobs portray the characters of Razor Ramon and Diesel respectively, characters that were made famous by both Scott Hall and Kevin Nash respectively before they joined WCW later in 1996). McMahon assured him that nothing of the sort would happen. Despite this, on the night after the Montreal Screwjob on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, D-Generation X performed a segment mockingly re-enacting the match between Michaels and Hart, with a dwarf dressed as Bret.

==Title transition==

Hart&#x27;s imminent move to WCW created a tense situation, as he had won the WWF Championship at SummerSlam 1997 from The Undertaker, which had featured Michaels as a special guest referee. The finish of the match saw Hart spit in Michaels face, followed by Michaels swinging a steel chair towards Hart, who ducked, and the chair striking The Undertaker down. Hart would cover The Undertaker, and Michaels would reluctantly perform the three count.

Hart&#x27;s WCW contract was scheduled to begin on December 5, one month after the WWF&#x27;s annual Survivor Series event, which was to be held in Montreal. Shawn Michaels, the leader of the emerging D-Generation X (DX) stable, had been booked into a main event title match with Hart at that show. McMahon, anxious for Hart to give up the title, sought his consent to job to Michaels. Hart, however, refused to give up the title to a member of The Kliq (a group that included Michaels, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and Sean Waltman that had previously held enormous backstage influence), apparently standing up for the rest of the locker room. As part of their rivalry storyline, Michaels had repeatedly performed acts insulting the Canadian flag and Canadian fans, which had also upset Hart.

Wrestling fans also knew of Hart&#x27;s long-standing personal difficulty with Michaels—Hart had been angered at Michaels&#x27;s forfeiture of the WWF Championship in February 1997, ruining plans for a Hart–Michaels rematch at WrestleMania 13, where Michaels was expected to lose the title to Hart. Hart also believed that Michaels had faked a knee injury and talked about major surgery just to get out of their planned match. While Michaels denied rumors that he did not want to lose to Hart, and indeed Hart wound up winning the title shortly after Michaels relinquished it, Hart felt certain that Michaels would not have offered a loss in return if he had been staying with the WWF. The two had been involved in a real fight after Michaels implied that Hart was having an affair with WWF valet Sunny. The recent storyline rivalry had also seen Michaels make insulting remarks about Hart&#x27;s father Stu Hart, which had left Bret and others in the Hart family upset. McMahon&#x27;s offering of an estimated $3 million contract to Hart in 1996 had reportedly also upset Michaels.

McMahon remained insistent about Hart dropping the title. The WWF owner was anxious over Hart pulling a move like that of former employee Debrah Miceli. Miceli, a veteran women&#x27;s wrestler who competed under the name Madusa for much of her career, performed as Alundra Blayze in the WWF from 1993 to 1995 and won the Women&#x27;s Championship during her stay there. McMahon, however, had neglected to renew her contract when it expired, and Miceli signed with WCW whilst still Women&#x27;s Champion. When she made her first appearance on &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot;, Madusa made fun of her time in the WWF and brought her title belt, which the WWF had neglected to take back, with her to the program, dumping it into a trash can. McMahon feared a repeat, despite claims from Bischoff that legal issues between the WWF and WCW would prevent such a thing, and that he would rather have Hart join WCW with a &quot;clean slate&quot;.

Hart continued to refuse to drop the title to Michaels, offering to lose the title anywhere in the United States prior to Survivor Series or to surrender the title to McMahon on the episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; the day after Survivor Series, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. After several disagreements, McMahon, Michaels and Hart agreed to a proposal of a disqualification finish, which would be the result of a brawl between Hart&#x27;s allies Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith with Michaels&#x27;s allies Triple H and Chyna, who would interfere in the match to aid Michaels. Hart would then lose or forfeit the title at a later date, as he was not due to start in WCW until December. Hart also asked for and obtained McMahon&#x27;s permission for an opportunity to explain his actions, his heel character, praise McMahon and the WWF and thus leave on good terms with the company and the fans.

At some point in the days leading up to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart&#x27;s impending departure from the WWF had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at Survivor Series would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing anything he could to get under McMahon&#x27;s skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on &quot;Nitro&quot; the following night (something Bischoff said would not have happened under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to &quot;Nitro&quot; going on the air live at 8:00p.m., which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart&#x27;s WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to preemptively strip Hart of the title.

==Setup and execution==

On November 8, 1997, one day before Survivor Series, McMahon met with Pat Patterson and Michaels in a hotel room in Montreal and planned the screwjob. It is unclear how many people knew of the impending betrayal, but McMahon&#x27;s close aide Gerald Brisco was involved in the planning. Jim Ross has insisted that he did not know the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart&#x27;s family, thought he was involved. Ross has stated that Jerry Lawler also did not know about the screwjob beforehand. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold at a time when the referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested.

The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels&#x27;s foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and start to make the count, but Hart would kick out, setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.

In his 1998 documentary &quot;Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows&quot;, Hart said that his fears were largely assuaged because he was close friends with referee Earl Hebner and trusted him implicitly. Asked by Hart, Hebner swore by his children that he would never double-cross Hart and that he would rather quit his job than participate in a screwjob. However, according to Michaels&#x27;s account of the events in his 2005 autobiography, &quot;Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story&quot;, Michaels himself informed Hebner of the plan only on Sunday evening, just as Survivor Series was about to commence. This contradicted what Hebner said on a 2003 edition of &quot;WWE Confidential&quot;, claiming that he first knew of McMahon&#x27;s plan only ten minutes before the match finished, and out of panic following the bell ringing, he ran out of the ring and through the crowd, after which he locked himself in his hotel room for the night, refusing to speak to anyone.

Tensions and excitement were high as the wrestlers and officials congregated for Survivor Series. Hart was anxious over the match finish and had been warned of the prospect of a screwjob by his brother-in-law and Hart Foundation member Davey Boy Smith as well as Vader, who had experienced similar situations while wrestling in Japan. They advised Hart to be alert, not lie on his back for too long, kick out from pinfall counts immediately so as to avoid a fast count, and not allow himself to be placed in submission holds.
The Molson Centre in Montreal was sold out, with more than 20,000 fans in attendance. Rumors of Hart&#x27;s imminent departure from WWF had leaked and consequently heightened the fan interest in the match. The mixed signals and a war of words between Hart, McMahon, Michaels and WCW further heightened anticipation. Emotions were also running high due to the Hart–Michaels rivalry and the &quot;U.S. vs. Canada&quot; storyline. While both men had been cordial with each other backstage, WWF officials ordered the deployment of a large number of company agents around the ring as a precaution if Hart decided to attack Michaels or McMahon in reaction to the double-cross. Highly unusual for any wrestling match, the deployment was explained on television as a necessary precaution in wake of the intense animosity between Hart&#x27;s and Michaels&#x27;s characters.

There was also some legitimate concern that Michaels could be attacked during the planned in-crowd brawl, by fans angered at his actions of demeaning the Canadian flag. Michaels&#x27;s entrance was greeted by loud booing and upon entering the ring, he proceeded to rub the Canadian flag against his crotch, picked his nose with it and later humped it—Michaels maintains that this flag desecration was actually suggested by Hart as an effective way to draw heat and emotion. The palpable anger of the fans was converted into raucous cheering as Hart entered the ring carrying the Canadian flag and wearing the championship belt. Hart, however, was visibly disturbed when segments of the crowd that were aware of his move to WCW jeered him with chants of &quot;You sold out!&quot; as the match progressed.

Once the match began, Hart and Michaels brought their performance outside the ring and into the crowd, while being followed by McMahon and WWF officials. As the climax of the match approached, the two wrestlers returned to the ring while WWF officials continued to order more personnel to ringside. Hart&#x27;s suspicions were first aroused upon noticing that Vince McMahon was not at the announcers&#x27; table to perform commentary, and that on-screen commissioner Sgt. Slaughter was also standing at ringside with Vince McMahon. Nevertheless, the match continued. As planned, Michaels pushed Hebner in front of him as Hart jumped from the top turnbuckle, sending all three men to the canvas. Michaels and Hart both got up, but Michaels performed a rake on Hart&#x27;s eye, sending Hart back to the mat. Michaels then proceeded to grab Hart&#x27;s legs to execute the Sharpshooter maneuver.

At this point, the match director was heard shouting instructions into his headset for Hebner to get up, but Hart did not notice anything amiss. Mike Chioda, the referee who was supposed to run in after Hebner went down, began yelling back that Hebner was not supposed to be up yet. Pat Patterson reacted in a similar way, and Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith, who were waiting for their cues to run in, remained backstage in a state of confusion. Michaels was then seen by many viewers as having glanced at Hebner as he put Hart in the sharpshooter, which some saw as proof that he was in on the scheme. Contrary to their agreed plan, Michaels tightened the hold and refused to offer his own leg to Hart for the latter to break out of the hold. At that moment, Hebner got to his feet, looked toward timekeeper Mark Yeaton, and shouted, &quot;Ring the bell!&quot; McMahon then elbowed Yeaton hard and yelled, &quot;Ring the fucking bell!&quot; Yeaton rang the bell just as Hart reached forward and grabbed Michaels&#x27;s leg, which broke the hold and caused Michaels to fall. According to Bret Hart, while he was trying to trip Shawn Michaels&#x27;s knee, he heard Vince McMahon say, &quot;Ring the bell!&quot; and he described he knew he was screwed right after the referee rang the bell.

Michaels&#x27;s theme music then began playing as the ring announcer declared him the winner and the new WWF Champion. Hebner had already exited the ring and was on his way out of the arena. Jim Ross can be heard on commentary asking, &quot;What happened?&quot; A moment later, he says, &quot;Bret Hart gave up in the Sharpshooter.&quot; After an initial moment of shock, Hart got to his feet, approached the apron where McMahon was standing and spat directly in his face, while Michaels feigned confusion. Michaels was ordered by McMahon to &quot;pick up the damn belt and get the hell out of here!&quot; Michaels left the arena with Brisco and Triple H and the broadcast signal cut off almost immediately after Michaels exited, with the last shot being a tight closeup of the Survivor Series logo above the entranceway. McMahon and most other WWF officials also quickly made their way backstage as an angry Hart smashed cameras, monitors, and ringside equipment. Fans in attendance also began to vent their fury on McMahon and WWF officials; a few even heaped garbage on them and some who were close enough pushed Michaels as he hurried backstage. Owen Hart, Neidhart and Davey Boy came out to the ring and had a conversation with Bret calming him down. Hart proceeded to finger trace &quot;W-C-W&quot; and &quot;I love you&quot; to the cheering fans before returning backstage.

==Reactions==
While much of the live Montreal audience immediately understood what had happened and responded angrily, television viewers had been left largely confused as Jim Ross promptly wrapped up the event on commentary and Survivor Series went off the air four minutes ahead of schedule with the parting image of Michaels holding the belt aloft as he disappeared backstage. Rumors and expressions of surprise and shock pervaded the Internet almost immediately after the match ended. Some observers considered it a creative and all-time great match finish. Observers of professional wrestling speculated whether the entire episode would result in WCW becoming the dominant promotion in Canada, where a large majority of fans had remained loyal to WWF, especially as the Hart family was working with the company. Wrestlers backstage during the aftermath were in an uproar.

Hart proceeded to the dressing rooms and questioned Michaels, who insisted he knew nothing about what had taken place and was equally outraged. McMahon locked himself in his office with Pat Patterson and other agents. Mark Calaway, the wrestler known as The Undertaker, screened the match in McMahon’s office and visited to Hart’s dressing room to express his shock. Furious with McMahon, Calaway went back to Vince’s office and banged on the door. McMahon opened and was told by Calaway he had to apologize to Hart. Recounted in Michaels&#x27;s autobiography, he was told by McMahon not to say anything about the screwjob to anybody, because McMahon needed to have everyone think that it was only him involved. Michaels offered his assurance that he would not carry the title belt out the next day on &quot;Raw&quot; and would refuse to say anything derogatory about Hart. Hart states in his autobiography that Undertaker and many wrestlers in the back supported him and it would have become mutiny. Hart proceeded to the dressing room to shower and change after discovering that McMahon, Brisco, and Slaughter had locked themselves in McMahon&#x27;s office. Bret had Owen Hart and Davey Boy Smith in the dressing room with him. Vince came into the dressing room with his son Shane McMahon, Brisco, Patterson, and Bruce Prichard. Everybody sat down, with Vince being on one side and Bret being on the other. Calaway, who came back with Vince, took Shawn to the far end of the dressing room and sat next to him, knowing he was eventually going to chime in and that wasn’t going to help. Along with this, throughout the aftermath, Calaway didn’t let anyone who wasn’t affected or involved in the dressing room. Both Vince and Bret started talking back and forth with Vince trying to explain his position and Bret giving his thoughts on what he thought about Vince and what he did. Hart then angrily rebuffed him and warned him to leave immediately or risk being punched.

Vince, however, didn’t leave and said “I’m gonna give you one”. An altercation ensued, with Hart throwing a right hand and hitting Vince in the temple, dropping him to the floor. Although Shane and Brisco struggled briefly with Hart and Davey Boy Smith, Hart told them to take McMahon and leave or risk similar consequences. When Bret angrily asked McMahon if he was going to screw him on the pay he was still owed, a groggy McMahon replied in the negative. In the hallway outside the dressing rooms, Hart&#x27;s then-wife Julie angrily confronted Triple H and others about the finish, but was escorted away by Owen Hart. McMahon had a black eye and a sprained ankle, which according to Bret Hart, was a result of his punch lifting Vince off the floor and Vince rolling his ankle once he landed. However, McMahon and Brisco have since stated on &quot;WWE Confidential&quot; that Brisco accidentally stepped on Vince&#x27;s foot, which as he tried to get back to his feet, immediately sprained his ankle and sent him back to the floor, from which he suffered a concussion, and referred to Brisco&#x27;s action as a &#x27;comedy.&#x27; Michaels and Triple H were later confronted and assailed by angry fans outside the Molson Centre and in the lobby of their hotel.

While Jim Neidhart, Davey Boy Smith, and Owen Hart had flown out of Montreal with Bret, McMahon faced a major revolt in the WWF locker room. Most wrestlers were outraged at him and threatened to boycott &quot;Raw&quot; or leave the company altogether. McMahon addressed a meeting in an effort to mollify the wrestlers who had been outraged that a WWF veteran had been double-crossed by McMahon—many feared for their own future and were suspicious of McMahon. McMahon sought to explain that Hart had been disregarding the company&#x27;s interests. By refusing to drop the title in Montreal, McMahon claimed Hart was jeopardizing the company&#x27;s future by creating a potentially embarrassing situation that could affect its fortunes. The potential revolt was also quelled by Hart&#x27;s counsel to wrestlers who asked him about boycotting &quot;Raw&quot; or leaving the company altogether. Hart advised them to fulfill their contractual obligations and not risk their own future over the episode. In protest, Mick Foley did not attend the next night&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; show, but returned to work after that due to a phone call from Jim Cornette, as well as his contract stipulations.

Hart later commented in his autobiography that if Foley returned to WCW, he would be committing career suicide. Rick Rude, who was working there briefly as a story line manager for Michaels and was a real life friend of Hart&#x27;s, called WCW and informed Eric Bischoff of what had transpired, and also returned to WCW two days after the events in Montreal mostly due to his disgust over Hart&#x27;s treatment. Rude appeared on both &quot;WWF Raw is War&quot; and &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; on November 17, 1997. A mustached Rude appeared on &quot;Nitro&quot;, which was live, and proceeded to criticize Michaels, DX, and the WWF, calling the company the &quot;Titanic&quot; (a reference to Titan Enterprises, as WWF&#x27;s parent company was then known, as the &quot;sinking ship&quot;). An hour later on &quot;Raw&quot; (which had been taped six days earlier), Rude then appeared with the full beard he had been sporting during his last few weeks in the WWF. Of the Hart family, only Owen continued to work with the company, being unable to terminate his contract.

At the next night&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; in Ottawa, Michaels appeared carrying the WWF title belt and performing a segment where he boasted before the audience of how he beat Hart with his own trademark move in his own country. McMahon gave a televised interview to commentator Jim Ross, explaining his version of events and making the now-infamous statement &quot;Vince McMahon didn&#x27;t screw Bret Hart. I truly believe that Bret Hart... screwed Bret Hart.&quot; Michaels continued his mocking of Hart in the coming weeks, performed a skit badgering a little person dressed up as Hart.

As McMahon expected, WCW did address Hart and the aftermath of the screwjob on &quot;Nitro&quot; from the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis that same night. Mike Tenay and Tony Schiavone strongly criticized McMahon and Michaels for their actions. The show started with Bischoff making reference to Hart&#x27;s impending arrival in WCW and his punching McMahon in the face, and he then used his on-air persona as the mouthpiece for the New World Order to claim (kayfabe) that Hart was to join the nWo as soon as he could be signed to WCW. Hollywood Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and the rest of the nWo members stood with Canadian flags and sang the Canadian national anthem.

WCW invoked the Screwjob again at Starrcade 1997, as Hart prevented Hogan from leaving with the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. He claimed that the referee Nick Patrick gave a fast count and that he would not allow Sting to be screwed, although Patrick seemingly did not give a fast count. The result was what critics called an anti-climax as most had expected Sting to win cleanly on skill alone. At Starrcade 1999, the finish of the match between Goldberg and Hart was for guest referee Roddy Piper to &quot;ring the bell&quot; once Hart placed Goldberg in the Sharpshooter despite Goldberg not submitting.

==Legacy==
The &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot; remains one of the most high-profile double-crosses in the history of professional wrestling and the first heavily publicized professional wrestling double-cross since Wendi Richter lost the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship to a masked Fabulous Moolah following a money dispute on November 25, 1985. It is perhaps the most controversial match in the history of the WWF, with the effects of its outcome being felt for over a decade later due to its notoriety and the infamous legacy it left in the company. Hart was ostracized by McMahon and later refused offers of induction to the WWF Hall of Fame. The documentary &quot;Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows&quot; included footage of McMahon&#x27;s conversations with Hart in which he affirmed the planned disqualification finish and expressed determination for Hart to exit &quot;the right way&quot; and as amicably as possible—McMahon did not know that the conversation was being recorded. In the recordings, Hart refused to drop the title to Michaels.

The Montreal Screwjob&#x27;s impact defined later storylines and rivalries. The WWF successfully tapped fan outrage at McMahon over the incident by creating the persona of &quot;Mr. McMahon&quot; — an authoritarian and arrogant heel boss who imposed his own will and authority on rebellious characters such as Stone Cold Steve Austin. Within the storylines, McMahon &quot;screwed&quot; such wrestlers in order to hand the title to the performer of his choice. The &quot;Bret screwed Bret&quot; line inspired promos that McMahon made during his feud with Austin. At , McMahon sat at ringside, placed strategically near the timekeeper, during Austin&#x27;s title defense against Dude Love, which caused Austin to allude to the Montreal Screwjob during a promotional interview. At Survivor Series 1998—the first anniversary of the screwjob—McMahon&#x27;s son Shane, a match referee, abandoned his on-screen rebellion against his father and allowed his father to screw Austin, by refusing to count Austin&#x27;s pinfall against Mankind. The McMahons then double-crossed Mankind in his main event WWF Championship match against The Rock later that night. Just as The Rock put the Sharpshooter hold on Mankind, McMahon called for the bell to be rung, even though Mankind did not submit. The Rock was declared the winner by submission and the new WWF Champion, fully re-enacting the Hart double-cross, this time with a switch between the respective face and heel characters.

Since then, professional wrestling storylines, including some storylines written by WWE, continue to refer to the screwjob whenever a title match ends under controversial circumstances. In the video game WWE 13, one of the playable matches on the single player campaign allows players to recreate the Montreal Screwjob.

==Resolution==
WWF eventually surpassed its arch-rival WCW. With its business steadily declining and a corporate takeover of its parent company (Time Warner) by America Online, WCW was put up for sale and purchased by Vince McMahon in 2001, once again making WWF the single-largest wrestling company in North America. Bret Hart&#x27;s entry into WCW had been hailed at the time as a major coup for the company, but it subsequently failed to utilize his popular appeal. Hart&#x27;s active wrestling career ended in 2000 after he suffered a serious concussion during a match with Goldberg. After dropping the WWF title to Austin at WrestleMania XIV in 1998, Michaels was forced into retirement for four years due to a serious back injury. After a long period of rehabilitation, Michaels returned to the ring in 2002 at SummerSlam, and eventually retired in 2010 at WrestleMania XXVI, losing a Streak vs. Career match to The Undertaker in the main event, but came out of retirement for one match eight years later at Crown Jewel in 2018.

After weeks of speculation, WWE.com announced in late August 2005 that Hart and WWE had agreed to collaborate on a DVD project chronicling Hart&#x27;s wrestling career. In subsequent interviews, Hart attributed his decision to his desire to be remembered for his storied career that spanned two decades. The project, which had been given the working title of &quot;Screwed: The Bret Hart Story&quot;, was renamed &quot;Bret &quot;Hit Man&quot; Hart: The Best There Is, the Best There Was, the Best There Ever Will Be&quot;. In the 2005 DVD chronicling his career, both Hart and Bischoff denied that his holding the WWF title was a factor in WCW&#x27;s desire to sign him. While McMahon claimed that there was mutual regret, Hart defended his actions and asserted that he stood by what he did. Hart was interviewed about the DVD and his career by Todd Grisham on the November 16, 2005, edition of &quot;Byte This!&quot;, marking Hart&#x27;s first appearance on WWE programming since the Montreal Screwjob.

Hart&#x27;s refusal to lose to Michaels in Montreal has been criticized by others such as Ric Flair, who asserted that it was Hart&#x27;s responsibility to drop the title belt of a company he was leaving (Flair himself was WCW World Heavyweight Champion when he left the company and signed with the WWF in 1991, even appearing on television with the NWA/WCW belt, but also dropped the WWF Championship to Hart on October 12, 1992, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan at a house show). Hart, however, maintains that he was prepared to lose the title anywhere and to anyone, except to Michaels in Canada given that, during 1997, his &quot;Hitman&quot; character had been built up as a great Canadian hero. As his contract with WWF did not expire for four more weeks, Hart asserts that there was plenty of time and several other opportunities for him to drop the title. Several accounts claim that McMahon had originally proposed that Hart drop the title at December&#x27;s In Your House pay-per-view in Springfield, Massachusetts, or at January&#x27;s Royal Rumble in San Jose, California.

Although Michaels expressed happiness at Hart&#x27;s 2006 induction into the Hall of Fame, the Hart–Michaels relationship remained laced with antagonism. Michaels criticized Hart&#x27;s behavior and conduct during his days in WWF in his 2005 autobiography, comparing the Screwjob to a &quot;mafia hit,&quot; and Hart has stated in his 2007 autobiography that he would &quot;never forgive&quot; Michaels. In interviews prior to the induction ceremony, Hart asserted that he would walk out from the ceremony if he saw Michaels anywhere on the WrestleMania 22 weekend. Michaels decided to step out of view to avoid a possible scene. Hart did not appear at the WrestleMania show in a mini-ceremony with the other inductees, explaining in an interview that he had never intended to attend or appear at the show. Hart would later return to WWE television on the June 11, 2007, edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he appeared in a taped promo spot mocking Mr. McMahon&#x27;s &quot;appreciation night.&quot; While he was able to reconcile to a degree with McMahon, Hart had never reconciled with Michaels. In a November 17, 2008, radio interview, Hart mocked Michaels&#x27;s version of the incident, saying, &quot;Shawn&#x27;s this Christian today; and in his book, he wrote that Vince took a dive and that I never even hit him and I thought, &#x27;This guy is such a liar&#x27;. I wonder what kind of Christian he is.&quot; Asked if he had seen or spoken to Michaels since 1997, Hart said, &quot;No. And I hope I never do... for his sake.&quot;

However, in 2009 Bret Hart stated in an interview with Sky Sports that he will forgive Michaels, if Shawn apologizes first, saying &quot;For me I don&#x27;t really have much issue with it anymore. If you asked me that up until probably about a year ago I&#x27;d have probably said something different. But I&#x27;ve cooled off a bit now. I don&#x27;t want to carry it around anymore. If he wanted to apologize I would accept it. I&#x27;d move on but I wouldn&#x27;t forget it.&quot; He also put over the Michaels-Undertaker match at WrestleMania 25, saying he was proud of both men&#x27;s efforts and that despite his personal feelings towards Michaels, he always had the utmost respect for his abilities. Similarly, Michaels has commended Hart&#x27;s abilities, calling him a &quot;sheer joy&quot; to work with in the ring.

===Bret Hart&#x27;s WWE return===

On the December 14, 2009, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Vince McMahon came out to announce the nominees for Guest Host of the Year during the Slammy Awards. After announcing Bob Barker as the recipient of the award, McMahon asked guest host Dennis Miller who he would like to see as a &quot;Raw&quot; guest host. Miller said he would like to see his long-time favorite, Bret Hart. McMahon dismissed Miller&#x27;s suggestion, reminding him that the last time Hart was in the WWE was when &quot;Bret screwed Bret,&quot; and that he likely would have no interest in hosting the show. Miller then asked the audience if they would like to see Hart as a guest host, to applause, but McMahon simply walked away. On December 16, Dave Meltzer of the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; reported that Hart had signed a four-month contract with WWE, and would debut as the guest host of &quot;Raw&quot; on January 4, 2010. On December 28, WWE.com confirmed that McMahon would be at &quot;Raw&quot; that night to address the rumors about Hart hosting the show. That night, McMahon confirmed that Hart will indeed be guest host on the January 4 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. A WWE.com article published shortly after the December 28 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; alluded to an &quot;almost guaranteed encounter between the WWE Chairman and the Hit Man.&quot;

Bret returned on the January 4, 2010, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, and promptly called out Michaels in order to bury the hatchet. Hart and Michaels then aired their grievances with one another while recognizing that their Ironman match at WrestleMania XII ought to be the highlight of their relationship rather than the Montreal Screwjob. The pair shook hands and Michaels turned as if to deliver Sweet Chin Music, but instead chose to embrace Hart. While many cast doubts on the sincerity of their reconciliation, Hart has confirmed that it was indeed genuine, as did Michaels, and acknowledged that he felt that Michaels changed as a person, for the better. Later in the night, a storyline between Hart and McMahon began with the two appearing to have their own reconciliation only to have McMahon subsequently kick Hart in the gut: in real life, Hart and McMahon have been on slight speaking terms since 2002, when McMahon called Hart during his recovery from a stroke. The feud culminated in an encounter at WrestleMania XXVI, which saw Hart defeat McMahon in a match that involved the Hart family. After the match, Hart would continue to periodically work televised events for WWE. Hart briefly held the WWE United States Championship in May 2010, a title he had held four times previously, all during his tenure in WCW. It was Hart&#x27;s first championship reign in WWE since the Montreal Screwjob.

Hart appeared on the September 10, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; at the Bell Centre in Montreal, marking his return for the first time to the same building where the Screwjob occurred, where he took part in an interview segment featuring John Cena and WWE Champion CM Punk. However, the episode was overshadowed by Jerry Lawler&#x27;s real on-air heart attack earlier in the evening, from which he eventually made a full recovery. He also briefly appeared during the 2013 Royal Rumble, giving a pep talk to Alberto Del Rio before his Last Man Standing match for the World Heavyweight Championship with Big Show. On the May 27, 2013, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, it was named &#x27;Bret Hart Appreciation Night&#x27;. Bret was pictured in the evening speaking to the likes of Kane, Daniel Bryan and Cena among others. At the end of the show, Michaels and Lawler handed him a plaque commemorating his career. The following week, Bret took part in &#x27;WWE Inbox&#x27;, a webshow held by WWE on its YouTube channel where Bret answered fans&#x27; Twitter questions.

==Discrepancies==
===Different accounts of proclaimed proponents of the event===
In his 2005 autobiography &quot;Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story&quot;, Michaels stated that it was his idea: &quot;It was my turn to chime in. &#x27;I&#x27;ll do whatever you want. We&#x27;ll just take it off him. I&#x27;ll just swerve him or whatever I have to. You tell me what needs to get done. You and this company have put up with so much from me. My loyalty is here with you. I&#x27;ll do whatever you want.&#x27; &#x27;What are we talking about, Shawn?&#x27; &#x27;Whatever it takes. If we have to do a fast count or get him in a hold and tell someone to ring the bell, I&#x27;ll do whatever you want me to do.&#x27;&quot; The sharpshooter spot had been suggested by Hart. &quot;We were talking things through, and Bret came up with this spot where I get him in the Sharpshooter and then he reverses it by pulling on my leg&quot;. Indirectly corroborating this assertion is Hart&#x27;s own testimony in his autobiography &quot;Hitman&quot;, that &quot;Pat Patterson told me that he thought it would be a heckuva spot to let Shawn put me in the Sharpshooter and then reverse it on him,&quot; which would indicate that Patterson had initially proposed the &quot;Sharpshooter&quot; spot to Bret. However, in the same work, Hart also states, &quot;I found myself jostling with Jerry Brisco, who I would find out later was the one who had designed the whole Screwjob for Vince.&quot;

Adding to this confusion, Vince Russo states in his book &quot;Forgiven&quot; that it was he who proposed the match&#x27;s ending to McMahon: &quot;&#x27;Vince – we&#x27;re making this way too difficult,&#x27; I said. &#x27;Why don&#x27;t we just do this? During the course of the match, let&#x27;s have a spot where Shawn puts Bret in his own hold – the Sharpshooter. As soon as Shawn clamps it on, have the referee call for the bell as if Bret quit...&#x27;&quot;. In a 2010 &quot;YouShoot&quot; interview, Jim Cornette told how he suggested to have Ken Shamrock &quot;double-cross&quot; Hart for the title – as Hart was reportedly willing to drop the belt to anyone except Michaels – therefore unwittingly introducing the concept of a screwjob to McMahon. During a meeting prior to the show, Triple H was the first person to suggest screwing Hart in the match, however in Viceland&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot; episode on the Montreal Screwjob, Cornette revealed that he was the first person to specifically suggest the Sharpshooter spot to Vince McMahon.

===Involvement of referee Earl Hebner===
In his book &quot;Heartbreak &amp; Triumph&quot;, Michaels states &quot;It was about seven o&#x27;clock when I walked into the locker room. There were only a few people in there and none were close to Earl. He was putting on his referee gear and I started to put my boots on. &#x27;Earl, I need you to listen to me very carefully.&#x27; I was speaking very softly. &#x27;We are doing a big swerve tonight. I am going to get Bret in the Sharpshooter and I need you to ring the bell.&#x27;&quot; However, Hebner states that Brisco was the person to tell him of the plan. And in an interview on Bruce Prichard&#x27;s Something to Wrestle podcast, Brisco confirms he told Hebner of the secret plan and pressured him into betraying Hart. Hebner was warned by Brisco that he was being microphoned, and at any point should Hebner alert Hart of the double-cross, he would be fired immediately.

===Pat Patterson&#x27;s involvement===
Michaels states in &quot;Heartbreak &amp; Triumph&quot; that during planning he was told &quot;&#x27;This cannot be discussed with anyone. Pat can&#x27;t know, nobody can know about this but the three of us right now&#x27;&quot;, &quot;We had the meeting, and as everyone was leaving, Vince asked me, Hunter, and Jerry Brisco, a longtime agent and close confidant of Vince&#x27;s, to stay. We sat down and talked&quot;, and &quot;Pat was in the room with us, and he had no idea what was going to happen. He had a strong relationship with Bret. He wouldn&#x27;t have done it, and Vince knew that. That&#x27;s why he didn&#x27;t tell Pat...&quot;. However, in Dave Meltzer&#x27;s online account of events before, during, and after the Screwjob, he states &quot;Vince McMahon held a meeting at the hotel with Jim Ross, Jim Cornette, Pat Patterson and Michaels. Reports are that at least two of the aforementioned names looked extremely uncomfortable leaving the meeting&quot; which suggests that Patterson may, in fact, have been in on the Screwjob. This is corroborated by a Pro Wrestling Torch article from November 15, 1997, by Wade Keller which states, &quot;However, a two-hour meeting was held on the second floor of the Montreal Marriott on Saturday night with McMahon, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Jim Cornette, and Michaels. Bret was wrestling that night in Detroit. There is some belief that at this meeting McMahon proposed the idea of the finish to whoever of that group wasn&#x27;t already in on it. Ross and Patterson entered the meeting in a good mood and when they were seen in the hotel lobby afterwards, were said to be irritable, forlorn, and shaken.&quot;

In addition, Hart states in &quot;Hitman&quot;, that while conversing with Michaels: &quot;I added, &#x27;I also want you to know that I have no problem dropping the belt to you if that&#x27;s what Vince wants.&#x27; He glared back at me. &#x27;I appreciate that, but I want you to know that I&#x27;m not willing to do the same for you.&#x27; And then he left. Jim [Neidhart] snorted, &#x27;I can&#x27;t believe that he just said that.&#x27; There was no way I could ever drop the belt to him now: he&#x27;d just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion...&quot; This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer&#x27;s account: &quot;During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he&#x27;d be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn&#x27;t return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn&#x27;t going to do a job for him.&quot; Additionally, in &quot;Forgiven&quot; Vince Russo stated, &quot;Well – no surprise here – Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional – but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn&#x27;t &quot;do business&quot; with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him.&quot;

===Legitimacy===
A fringe belief, espoused by several within the business, believes the Montreal Screwjob was a work, in which Hart acted in collaboration with McMahon. Longtime pro wrestling journalist Bill Apter, along with industry veterans Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Bam Bam Bigelow, Road Dogg, George Steele, Chris Kanyon, Steve Corino, Tony Mamaluke, Justin Credible, Paul Bearer, and Sunny, have gone on record saying they believe this to have been the case (Sunny reported that her former boyfriend, Chris Candido, also subscribed to this notion). Shawn Michaels recalled people backstage saying that the screwjob &quot;had to be a work&quot;, and claimed that McMahon &quot;took a dive&quot; and &quot;sold like he sells on TV&quot; when struck by Hart following the incident. Earl Hebner, who refereed the contest, was asked in 2019 if he thought Hart was &quot;in on the work&quot;, to which he replied, &quot;I really do... I&#x27;m not going to lie about it anymore.&quot;

Jerry Lawler, who served as ringside commentator for the match, found it plausible that Hart was working with McMahon. This position was shared by Hart&#x27;s nephew Teddy Hart, as well as by his former colleagues Demolition (Ax and Smash), Road Warrior Animal, Steve Blackman, Gregory Helms and Sean Waltman. Waltman, who claimed to know Hart well, was bewildered as to how Hart could not have seen the screwjob coming from &quot;a million miles away&quot;, and felt there was a &quot;high possibility&quot; of the incident being a work. Waltman added that Hart would not have told anyone, including his wife, about his involvement, and deduced: &quot;I think [the screwjob] was so compartmentalized that the guys that were in on it don&#x27;t even know who else was.&quot; The &quot;Pro Wrestling Torch&quot; reported that, outside of the business, &quot;many wrestling fans&quot; believe the screwjob to have been a work.

In an interview in 2022, Bret Hart reaffirmed that the incident was not a work.

<text>Nicholas Frederick Brady (born April 11, 1930) is an American banker and politician from New Jersey who briefly served in the United States Senate for eight months in 1982 and served as the 68th United States Secretary of the Treasury under U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush from 1988 to 1993. He is a member of the Republican Party.

In April 1982, he was appointed U.S. senator to finish the unexpired term of Harrison A. Williams, and did not seek election. As of 2025, Brady is the last Republican to serve in New Jersey&#x27;s Class 1 U.S. Senate seat and is the oldest living former U.S. senator since the death of Daniel J. Evans.

As U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Brady proposed and enacted a novel debt-reduction agreement for developing countries which became known as Brady Bonds.

==Early life==
Brady was born on April 11, 1930 in Manhattan, New York City, the son of James Cox Brady Jr., and his wife, Eliot Chace. He was named for his paternal great-uncle, businessman and philanthropist Nicholas Frederic Brady. His great-grandfather was industrialist Anthony N. Brady. His father was a major figure in thoroughbred horse racing in the United States and Europe.

He grew up on an estate in Far Hills, New Jersey. After graduating from St. Mark&#x27;s School in Southborough, Massachusetts, Brady attended Yale University (Bachelor of Arts, 1952), where he was a member of Chi Psi fraternity. He received his Master of Business Administration from Harvard University in 1954.

==Career==
Brady&#x27;s career in the banking industry spanned 34 years. He joined the now-defunct Dillon, Read &amp; Co. in New York City in 1954, rising to chairman of the board in 1970.

He has been the Chairman of Darby Overseas Investments, Ltd. and Darby Technology Ventures Group, LLC, investment firms, since 1994. Mr. Brady is Chairman of Franklin Templeton Investment Funds (an international investment management company), a director of Hess Corporation (an exploration and production company) and Holowesko Partners Ltd. (investment management companies). He is also a director of the oilfield services company Weatherford International since 2004. He has been a director of the NCR Voyix, the Mitre Corporation, and Heinz, among others.

Brady is a former chairman of the boards of the now-defunct investment bank Dillon, Read &amp; Co. (1970–1988) and Purolator Filters (1971–1987).

=== New Jersey politics and United States Senate appointment ===

Brady served as the Republican committeeman of Somerset County, New Jersey. In 1981, he served as head of the transition team for Thomas Kean following Kean&#x27;s election as Governor of New Jersey.

In 1982, Kean faced the duty of filling a vacancy caused by the resignation of United States Senator Harrison A. Williams, following a planned expulsion vote in the wake of the Abscam sting operation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Williams delayed his resignation for ten months following his conviction for bribery, preventing Democratic governor Brendan Byrne from appointing a successor, until junior senator Bill Bradley announced he would vote for expulsion on March 10, 1982.

At the time of Williams&#x27; resignation, two Republican candidates, U.S. Representative Millicent Fenwick and conservative activist Jeff Bell, were already in the race for the next full term for the U.S. Senate. U.S. Representative Jim Courter also planned a campaign for Senate but ultimately chose not to run. After a month of deliberation and consulting with over one hundred state and local Republicans, Kean chose to remain neutral in the primary and appointed Brady as a caretaker.

Brady served from April 12, 1982 to December 27, 1982. During his time in the Senate, he was a member of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services and the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. He resigned from office before the expiration of the term, so that Frank Lautenberg, the winner of the 1982 election, could enter the Senate early for purposes of seniority. In September 2024, he became the oldest living former U.S. senator following the death of Daniel J. Evans.

=== Advisor to Ronald Reagan ===
In 1984, Reagan appointed Brady to be Chairman of the President&#x27;s Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries. He also served on the President&#x27;s Commission on Strategic Forces (1983), the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America (1983), the Commission on Security and Economic Assistance (1983), and the Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management (1985). He also chaired the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms in 1987.

=== Secretary of the Treasury ===

Brady became the 68th United States Secretary of the Treasury on September 15, 1988, and served during the last four months of Reagan&#x27;s presidency and throughout the George H. W. Bush administration. In 1989, after a period of years in which a number of developing countries, including Mexico, defaulted on their external debt, he developed the Brady Plan to help them sell United States dollar-denominated bonds. These became known as Brady Bonds.

Early in his tenure as Treasury Secretary, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Brady had a rocky start and was &quot;bland on television and awkward as a public speaker.&quot; But as a close friend and advisor to President Bush he had considerable influence. Chuck Schumer of New York, who was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives at the time, expressed the prevailing view: &quot;Is he the smartest guy in the world? No. Did he make some major screwups? Yes. But Brady is one of the few people in the Government trying to do real substance. On savings and loan, he stepped up to the plate and swung at balls. The same with the third world debt. I&#x27;m not sure I agree with his plan, but at least he tried to do something. So, in an Administration where so much seems aimed at image and hype, Brady does deserve a lot of credit.&quot;

He has also served as a trustee of Rockefeller University and a member of the Board of the Economic Club of New York. He is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Meeting. He is a former trustee of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America of Newark, New Jersey. Brady received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1977.

==Personal life==
Brady married Katherine Douglas (known as Kitty, daughter of Percy Livingston Douglas, president of the Otis Elevator Company) in 1952, and they had four children and 13 grandchildren. Katherine Brady died on January 6, 2021 at age 89.

Although never involved with horse racing at the same level as his father, he served for a time as chairman of The Jockey Club. Mill House (Stable) is the &quot;nom de course&quot; for Brady&#x27;s racing operation.

<text>George Francis FitzGerald (3 August 1851 – 21 February 1901) was an Irish physicist known for hypothesising length contraction, which became an integral part of Albert Einstein&#x27;s special theory of relativity.

==Life and work in physics==
FitzGerald was born at No. 19, Lower Mount Street in Dublin on 3 August 1851 to the Reverend William FitzGerald and his wife Anne Frances Stoney (sister of George Johnstone Stoney and Bindon Blood Stoney). Professor of Moral Philosophy in Trinity and vicar of St Anne&#x27;s, Dawson Street, at the time of his son&#x27;s birth, William FitzGerald was consecrated Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross in 1857 and translated to Killaloe and Clonfert in 1862. George returned to Dublin and entered Trinity College Dublin as a student at the age of 16, winning a scholarship in 1870 and graduating in 1871 in Mathematics and Experimental Science. He became a Fellow of Trinity in 1877 and spent the rest of his career there, becoming Erasmus Smith&#x27;s Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy in 1881.

Along with Oliver Lodge, Oliver Heaviside and Heinrich Hertz, FitzGerald was a leading figure among the group of &quot;Maxwellians&quot; who revised, extended, clarified, and confirmed James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s mathematical theories of the electromagnetic field during the late 1870s and the 1880s.

In 1883, following from Maxwell&#x27;s equations, FitzGerald was the first to suggest a device for producing rapidly oscillating electric currents to generate electromagnetic waves, a phenomenon which was first shown to exist experimentally by the German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1888.

In 1878, FitzGerald was elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy (MRIA). He was Secretary of the Royal Dublin Society from 1881-1889. In 1883, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). In 1899, was awarded a Royal Medal for his investigations in theoretical physics. In 1900, he was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE).

FitzGerald, a crater on the far side of the Moon, was named in his honour, as well as the Fitzgerald Building at Trinity College Dublin.

FitzGerald suffered from many digestive problems for much of his shortened life. He became very ill with stomach problems. He died at his home, 7 Ely Place in Dublin, shortly after an operation on a perforated ulcer on 21 February 1901. He is buried in Mount Jerome cemetery.

==Length contraction==

FitzGerald is better known for his conjecture in his short letter to the editor of Science () that if all moving objects were foreshortened in the direction of their motion, it would account for the curious null-results of the Michelson–Morley experiment. FitzGerald based this idea in part on the way electromagnetic forces were known to be affected by motion. In particular, FitzGerald used some equations that had been derived a short time before by his friend the electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside. The Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz hit on a very similar idea in 1892 and developed it more fully into Lorentz transformations, in connection with his theory of electrons.

The Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction (or FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction) hypothesis became an essential part of the Special Theory of Relativity, as Albert Einstein published it in 1905. He demonstrated the kinematic nature of this effect, by deriving it from the principle of relativity and the constancy of the speed of light.

==Family==
FitzGerald married, on 21 December 1885, Harriette Mary, daughter of the Reverend John Hewitt Jellett, Provost of TCD and Dorothea Morris Morgan. He had eight children by her, three sons and five daughters.

FitzGerald was the nephew of George Johnstone Stoney, the Irish physicist who coined the term &quot;electron&quot;. After the particles were discovered by J. J. Thomson and Walter Kaufmann in 1896, FitzGerald was the one to propose calling them electrons. FitzGerald was also the nephew of Bindon Blood Stoney, an eminent Irish engineer. His cousin was Edith Anne Stoney, a pioneer female medical physicist.

==Flying experiments==
FitzGerald, in common with others at the end of the nineteenth century, became obsessed with the desire to fly. His attempts in College Park, in Trinity College Dublin, in 1895 involved large numbers of students pulling tow-ropes attached to the Lilienthal glider, and attracted the attention of the people of Dublin, beyond the Nassau Street railings. FitzGerald took off his coat on these occasions, but retained his top hat, which was normal headgear for a Fellow at that time. The experiments were not crowned with success, and were eventually abandoned. The flying machine hung for many years in the Museum Building until an idle engineering student applied a match to the cord from which it was hanging. The flame travelled along the cord and consumed the glider before the helpless onlookers.

<doc id="542880" wikidata="Q1671528" url="?curid=542880" title="Into the Unknown (Bad Religion album)">
<text>Into the Unknown is the second studio album by Bad Religion, released in August 1983 through Epitaph Records. The album marks a distinct departure from the band&#x27;s previous album; instead of featuring hardcore punk, the album is characterized by slower tempos, use of electronic organ and pianos, and a prog-influenced hard rock sound. &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; is the only Bad Religion album to feature Paul Dedona on bass and Davy Goldman on drums. Dedona was ejected from the band before their next recording and replaced by Tim Gallegos, while former drummer Pete Finestone returned to the band in 1986. The album also features Bad Religion&#x27;s longest track to date, &quot;Time and Disregard&quot;, which is seven minutes long.

&quot;Into the Unknown&quot; proved to be the band&#x27;s most controversial release; despite favorable reviews from music critics, it was a commercial failure, and was characterized as a &quot;misstep&quot; by guitarist Brett Gurewitz. It was not reissued on any format until 2010, when it was issued on vinyl as part of the box set &quot;30 Years of Bad Religion&quot;, and has never been reissued on its own.

==Background and production==
While on tour promoting their debut studio album &quot;How Could Hell Be Any Worse?&quot; (1982), the members of Bad Religion noticed a shift in the mood of people involved in the punk rock scene in Southern California. In the lead up to the record sessions of their second album, the band members were adamant that punk is dead and decided to move on from the genre. According to author Dave Thompson in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), the subsequent sessions were &quot;fraught at the best of times and positively disastrous at the worse of times.&quot; Guitarist Brett Gurewitz stated that it was quickly produced after the release of the band&#x27;s debut album because the band did not take themselves seriously and did not think it would last very long, despite the success of their debut and popularity on the underground music scene. Gurewitz said that little thought was put into the album&#x27;s production. Bassist Jay Bentley was outraged at vocalist Greg Graffin&#x27;s over-usage of a Roland Juno-60 synthesizer that he quit the band when they were partway through recording the first track of the sessions. Drummer Pete Finestone then left to study in England; his role was filled by Davy Goldman, while Bentley&#x27;s was taken by Paul Dedona. Bad Religion hired producer Thom Wilson to collaborate with the band during the album&#x27;s production.

==Musical style and influences==
Gurewitz and the other band members were very much into progressive rock before getting into punk rock, and wanted to record an album reflecting a prog and avant-garde influence. The album is characterized by slower tempos and use of electronic organ and piano-driven melody. Thompson described the album&#x27;s sound as Graffin&#x27;s &quot;auteur keyboards colliding punk and proto-synthpop, before sailing off into distinctly softer, rockier pastures and prescient soaring harmonies.&quot;

==Release and reception==

Because of the band&#x27;s success, they produced more copies of this album than they had of their debut. Gurewitz joked about having &quot;[sent out] ten thousand copies and [getting] eleven thousand back.&quot; The album was a commercial failure to the point that the band and Epitaph Records, their label, disbanded.

Tim Yohannan, founder of punk zine &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot;, called the album &quot;slickly produced early ’70s wimp rock&quot; and said that &quot;After playing it, I hurled it out the window, into the unknown.&quot; In a positive review of the album, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau said, &quot;I find myself moved by its anthemic ambition--and achievement.&quot; John Dougan of AllMusic says that &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; is &quot;a bit off-putting at first blush, mainly because the tempos are slower and more deliberate, and because of the use of swirling organs and pianos&quot;, while he calls it a &quot;terrific record that was perhaps more daring than anyone realized at the time of its release.&quot; Chuck Eddy has praised the album, saying it &quot;sounds like Hawkwind but feels way less exotic, more like how the prairie art-schlockers in Kansas and Styx always &quot;tried&quot; to feel.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Into the Unknown&quot; is Bad Religion&#x27;s most controversial release. The band broke up after the album&#x27;s release, but reformed in 1985. Gurewitz characterized the album as a &quot;terrible misstep&quot;. Graffin thought it sounded like the early work of R.E.M., and that it would have been received better had it been release a couple of years later. Although &quot;Into the Unknown&quot; has never been officially released on CD, bootleg CDs of the album exist.

Graffin recalls that the band only performed material from this album once when it was released; when Bad Religion premiered the material live, only 12 people turned out for the concert because fans learned that the band was going to bring keyboards on stage. The band then decided not to bring keyboards on tour with them and return to their hardcore punk sound. In October 2010, the band performed &quot;Billy Gnosis&quot;, the first time in 27 years that Bad Religion had performed any songs from the album in concert. In December, the band released the vinyl box set &quot;30 Years of Bad Religion&quot;, which reissued all 15 of the band&#x27;s LPs, including &quot;Into the Unknown&quot;. The band&#x27;s website offers commentaries from Greg Graffin and Brett Gurewitz. &quot;The Dichotomy&quot; was repeatedly played live in 2019.

Only four songs have been played live off this album: &quot;It&#x27;s Only Over When...&quot;, &quot;Billy Gnosis&quot;, &quot;The Dichotomy&quot; and &quot;...You Give Up&quot;.

<text>Hugh John Flemming (January 5, 1899 – October 16, 1982) was a politician and the 24th premier of New Brunswick from 1952 to 1960.

He is always known as &quot;Hugh John&quot;. Born in Peel, New Brunswick, Canada, the son of James Kidd Flemming, Premier of New Brunswick from 1911 to 1914, Hugh John Flemming was first elected to the province&#x27;s Legislative Assembly in 1944 after more than twenty years as a municipal councillor. In 1951 he became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick leading the party to victory on 22 September 1952. Flemming would then lead the 42nd New Brunswick Legislature, which ran from 11 February 1952 to 17 April 1956. He and his party were re-elected to govern the 43rd New Brunswick Legislature.

As Premier during two terms, Flemming modernized the province&#x27;s hydro system, built the Beechwood Dam, then the largest hydro-electric project in the province, and presented a balanced budget every year in office.

Universal health care, which had been proposed formally by the St. Laurent government at the 1955 federal-provincial summit on taxation, would become his nemesis because of his reluctance to sink the budget of the province.

In 1960 his government was defeated because of the hospital tax, which had been set by his government at $50 per capita and which the Liberals promised to abolish while maintaining a balanced budget, and the Liberal promises to reform alcohol sales, and to revive the moose hunt.

Following the defeat of his provincial government, he was named Minister of Forestry in the cabinet of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. He sought a seat in a by-election in southern New Brunswick in 1960 and was re-elected to his home district four times before he retired from the House of Commons of Canada in 1972. He became Minister of National Revenue in 1962, but in 1963 the then-minority government was defeated by the 25th Canadian Parliament, and he would spend his remaining years in Parliament on the opposition benches. Flemming died in Fredericton, New Brunswick.

==Legacy==

Flemming&#x27;s son, Hugh John Flemming, Jr. ran for a seat in the New Brunswick Legislature in 1974 but lost to Shirley Dysart by 73 votes. His grandson Ted Flemming was elected to the provincial legislature in the 2012 Rothesay by-election and served as New Brunswick&#x27;s minister of health from 2012 to 2014.

Flemming&#x27;s family-run lumber mill in the village of Juniper, New Brunswick ran into financial difficulties in the late 1970s, but his friend Harrison McCain, organized an investment campaign that raised sufficient capital from businessmen to allow the mill to make a financial recovery. The mill was sold and dismantled c 2010 and the area has been re-purposed to store production of the peat moss facility. His wife Aida was the founder of the Kindness Club, an organization to facilitate kindness toward animals geared towards children.

The Hugh John Flemming Forestry Centre in Fredericton is home to the Maritime College of Forest Technology as well as several branches of the governments of New Brunswick and Canada, and the K.C. Irving Theatre.

Flemming and his wife Aida are buried in the Methodist Church Cemetery in Woodstock, New Brunswick.

<doc id="542885" wikidata="Q855150" url="?curid=542885" title="Pygmalion effect">
<text>The Pygmalion effect is a psychological phenomenon in which high expectations lead to improved performance in a given area and low expectations lead to worse performance. It is named after the Greek myth of Pygmalion, the sculptor who fell so much in love with the perfectly beautiful statue he created that the statue came to life. The psychologists Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson present a view, that has been called into question as a result of later research findings, in their book &quot;Pygmalion in the Classroom;&quot; borrowing something of the myth by advancing the idea that teachers&#x27; expectations of their students affect the students&#x27; performance. Rosenthal and Jacobson held that high expectations lead to better performance and low expectations lead to worse, both effects leading to self-fulfilling prophecy.

According to the Pygmalion effect, the targets of the expectations internalize their positive labels, and those with positive labels succeed accordingly; a similar process works in the opposite direction in the case of low expectations. The idea behind the Pygmalion effect is that increasing the leader&#x27;s expectation of the follower&#x27;s performance will result in better follower performance.

Within sociology, the effect is often cited with regard to education and social class. The Pygmalion effect remains controversial among social psychologists, because researchers have repeatedly failed to replicate the original finding of a strong, statistically significant effect.

== Rosenthal–Jacobson study ==
Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson&#x27;s study showed that children&#x27;s performance was enhanced if teachers were led to expect enhanced performance from children. By the same token, if teachers were led to expect lower performance from children, then the children&#x27;s performance would be diminished. The authors purported that the study&#x27;s results supported the hypothesis that performance can be positively or negatively influenced by the expectations of others. This phenomenon is called the observer-expectancy effect. Rosenthal argued that biased expectancies could affect reality and create self-fulfilling prophecies.

All students in a single California elementary school were given a disguised IQ test at the beginning of the study. These scores were not disclosed to teachers. Teachers were told that some of their students (about 20% of the school chosen at random) could be expected to be &quot;intellectual bloomers&quot; that year, doing better than expected in comparison to their classmates. The bloomers&#x27; names were made known to the teachers. At the end of the study, all students were again tested with the same IQ test used at the beginning of the study. All six grades in both experimental and control groups showed a mean gain in IQ from before the test to after the test. However, first- and second-graders showed statistically significant gains favoring the experimental group of &quot;intellectual bloomers.&quot; This led to the conclusion that teacher expectations, particularly for the youngest children, can influence student achievement. Rosenthal believed that even attitude or mood could positively affect the students when the teacher was made aware of the &quot;bloomers.&quot; The teacher may pay closer attention to and even treat the child differently in times of difficulty.

Rosenthal predicted that elementary school teachers may subconsciously behave in ways that facilitate and encourage the students&#x27; success. When finished, Rosenthal theorized that future studies could be implemented to find teachers who would encourage their students naturally without changing their teaching methods. Rosenthal and Jacobson&#x27;s study of the Pygmalion effect was criticized for both weak methodology and lack of replicability (see &quot;Pygmalion in the Classroom&quot;).

The prior research that motivated this study was conducted in 1911 by psychologists regarding the case of Clever Hans, a horse that gained notoriety because it was supposed to be able to read, spell, and solve math problems by using its hoof to answer. Many skeptics suggested that questioners and observers were unintentionally signaling Clever Hans. For instance, whenever Clever Hans was asked a question the observers&#x27; demeanor usually elicited a certain behavior from the subject that in turn confirmed their expectations. For example, Clever Hans would be given a math problem to solve, and the audience would get very tense the closer he tapped his foot to the right number, thus giving Hans the clue he needed to tap the correct number of times.

== Mediator - leadership behavior ==
Leadership was identified by Eden and Shani as a mediator of the Pygmalion effect. The study discovered that trainees with strong command potential gave instructors better overall leadership evaluations than trainees in the control group. According to a later analysis of the survey by Eden, instructors were rated more positively on each of the four management leadership dimensions by Bowers and Seashore. Eden referred to this phenomenon as the Pygmalion leadership style (PLS). PLS includes consistently promoting, supporting, and reinforcing expectations, which leads to the subordinates adopting, accepting, or internalizing those expectations. Notably, those instructors needed to be made aware of their different manner of treating the trainees, supporting Rosenthal&#x27;s claim that how instructors treat high-expectations people are not consciously intended or deliberate.

== Mediator - The Galatea effect ==
The second mediator of the Pygmalion effect is the direct result of PLS, labeled by Eden and Ravid as the Galatea effect, which is the effect of directly manipulating trainees&#x27; self-expectations of themselves. The PLS leadership behaviors have the chance to raise trainees&#x27; expectations of their performance. In the IDF training program study, Eden and Ravid observed that raising instructors&#x27; expectations for particular trainees led to both greater performance (the Pygmalion effect) and increased self-expectations for those trainees. The research also demonstrated that improving these trainees&#x27; performance levels may be accomplished by directly raising their expectations by telling them—rather than their instructors—that they had high potential.

==Criticism of the Pygmalion effect==

The educational psychologist Robert L. Thorndike described the poor quality of the Pygmalion study. The problem with the study was that the instrument used to assess the children&#x27;s IQ scores was seriously flawed. The average reasoning IQ score for the children in one regular class was in the mentally disabled range, a highly unlikely outcome in a regular class in a garden variety school. In the end, Thorndike concluded that the Pygmalion findings were worthless. Quoting a colleague, Thorndike wrote about the measurement problems of the study in this way: &quot;When the clock strikes thirteen, doubt is cast not only on the last stroke but also all that have gone before&quot; (p. 710). It is more likely that the rise in IQ scores from the mentally disabled range was the result of regression toward the mean, not teacher expectations. Moreover, a meta-analysis conducted by Raudenbush showed that when teachers had gotten to know their students for two weeks, the effect of a prior expectancy induction was reduced to virtually zero.

A 2005 meta-analysis of 35 years of research on teacher expectations found that, while self-fulfilling prophecies in the classroom do occur, the effects are usually small and temporary. It is unknown whether self-fulfilling prophecies affect intelligence or have an otherwise harmful effect. The cause of the effect may be because teachers&#x27; expectations of students are accurate, and not because they are self-fulfilling. Rosenthal had originally claimed the treatment group&#x27;s IQ gain over time was &quot;24.8 IQ points in excess of the gain shown by the controls,&quot; and that these gains were persistent and widespread, but several studies since the 1980s have failed to replicate these results. Instead, they have found only a very weak effect, and only in a very small minority (5 to 10%) of students. The marginal performance gains have also been found to &quot;reset&quot; after a period of just weeks.

== Students&#x27; views of teachers ==
Teachers are also affected by the children in the classroom. Teachers reflect what is projected into them by their students. An experiment done by Jenkins and Deno (1969) submitted teachers to a classroom of children who had either been told to be attentive, or unattentive, to the teachers&#x27; lecture. They found that teachers who were in the attentive condition would rate their teaching skills as higher. Similar findings by Herrell (1971) suggested that when a teacher was preconditioned to classrooms as warm or cold, the teacher would start to gravitate towards their precondition. To further this concept, Klein (1971) did the same kind of study involving teachers still unaware of any precondition to the classroom but with the class full of confederates who were instructed to act differently during periods over the course of the lecture. &quot;Klein reported that there was little difference between students&#x27; behaviors in the natural and the positive conditions.&quot; In a more observational study designed to remove the likes of the Hawthorne effect, Oppenlander (1969) studied the top and bottom 20% of students in the sixth grade from a school that tracks and organizes its students under such criteria.

== Application in the workplace ==
The behavior a leader directs at an employee can affect employee behavior consistent with the leader&#x27;s expectations. Leader expectations of an employee may alter leader behavior. For example, a leader may expect an employee to be engaged in learning activities and in turn, the employee may engage in more learning, consistent with the idea self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders have power over employees (including the power to fire an employee) and, thus, behavior change in employees may be the result of that power differential.

== Application in military settings ==
The Pygmalion effect is further confirmed in military settings after its application in the workplace. Eden and Shani used instructors and trainees from Israeli Defense Force (IDF) training programs in 1982 to experiment with a military setting to verify the Pygmalion effect. They randomly chose a group of trainees and told the instructors that they had exceptional leadership potential. In turn, this group outperformed the control groups on four objective tests. This study was noteworthy since it used adult Israeli soldiers as a sample rather than the previous sample of the American child, inferring that the Pygmalion effect could be applied to different contexts rather than only the original classroom setting where it was originally noticed and replicated, confirming its generalisability.

== Application in nursing ==
The Pygmalion effect has been noted in several non-educational contexts. For instance, in a nursing home, nurses were told that some patients would progress more quickly in their rehabilitation than others. These patients demonstrated lower levels of depression and required hospitalization less frequently than those with average expectations.

The Pygmalion effect has also been discussed in relation to treating alcohol dependence since it was discovered that therapists who characterized their clients as &quot;motivated&quot; had a lower dropout rate than those who labeled them as &quot;unmotivated&quot;.

== Gender limitations ==
One significant constraint of the practical application of Pygmalion research is the unresolved issue of whether the Pygmalion effect operates uniformly across genders. Notably, studies conclude a lack of the Pygmalion effect for women. This suggests that, unlike their male colleagues, the higher standards for female leaders could only sometimes result in increased subordinate performance.

Female subordinates have been utilized in many studies, which in turn failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between the Pygmalion effect. For instance, King&#x27;s unpublished research in 1970 provided two examples of failed Pygmalion effect attempts that both primarily involved female subordinates. The Pygmalion effect was undetectable in Sutton and Woodman&#x27;s research of female principal attendants in the retail industry.

== Ethical limitations ==
The traditional Pygmalion practice entails deception, which may be considered unethical in actual organizational contexts. According to some researchers, it shouldn&#x27;t be made a default practice in these real-life circumstances. Managers have to be deceived by their boss or staff personnel during the implementation of this manipulation. If the deception were revealed and revealed publicly, it could lead to a significant deterioration of trust within the workplace.

<doc id="542895" wikidata="Q1137599" url="?curid=542895" title="Coupé de ville">
<text>Coupé de ville is a car body style produced from 1908 to 1939. It has an external or open-topped driver&#x27;s position, as well as an enclosed compartment for passengers. Although the different terms may have once had specific meanings for certain car manufacturers or countries, the terms are often used interchangeably.

Some coupés de ville have the passengers separated from the driver in a fully enclosed compartment while others have a canopy for the passengers and no partition between the driver and the passengers (passengers enter the compartment via driver&#x27;s area).

==Origin==

The separate exposed area for the driver followed from horse-drawn carriages.

The term &quot;coupé de ville&quot; came into existence in the 19th century before the invention of the automobile. The initial usage of the term was for a variant of the coupé carriage that is very similar to the British clarence carriage.

The term &quot;de ville&quot; is French for &quot;for town&quot; and indicates that the vehicle is for use in town or for short distances. When added to the end of a body style (saloon, coupé, landaulet, etc.), &quot;de Ville&quot; indicated that the top over the driver&#x27;s compartment could be folded away, retracted, or otherwise removed. As a vehicle for town use, the coupé de ville usually had no facilities for carrying luggage.

==Design==

Early cars had the driver fully exposed to the weather with no cover, no doors, and sometimes no windshield. As speed and distances travelled increased, windshields were added to protect the driver from dirt from the unpaved roads and dung from draught animals. Later models also included doors to the driving compartment.

Early roofs for the driver&#x27;s area were made of a single skin of leather without any structural support, and were held in place between the passenger compartment and the windshield by poppers to allow for easy removal or rollback when the weather allowed. From the late 1920s onward designs used a metal two-skin roof which retracted into a void above the passenger compartment, either manually or electrically.

Due to its use as a chauffeured vehicle, the passenger compartment was normally luxurious, clad in the best materials, with seating for between two and most often up to six or occasionally eight persons, made of the finest cotton or silk adorned with brocade. The same material was also most often used to provide complete curtain coverage for the compartment, and was matched by substantial carpet and fine inlaid woodwork. The driver&#x27;s compartment had leather seats to endure bad weather. The division between the two compartments often held jump seats for lighter passengers such as children, and it would often accommodate various compartments for drinks, cigars, make-up, or books.

Some versions had a partition between the driver and the passengers. These partitions often had a small slide-back glass window, or were completely made of glass with a manual or electric winding system. The passengers could speak to the driver through a communications tube, or, from the 1920s, through an electrical device similar to a telephone. Some designs included a switch panel in the rear passenger compartment, which contained a speedometer and switches to impart the most common instructions to the driver via a lighted dashboard panel, such as &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, or &quot;home&quot;.

== Variants ==
=== Town car / town brougham ===
In the United States, a coupé de ville with rear doors for the passenger area, no roof or sides for the driver&#x27;s area, and a partition between the passengers and the driver was referred to as a &quot;town car&quot; or &quot;town brougham&quot;. Town cars normally had side windows in the doors only. The name &quot;town car&quot; is an Anglicized version of &quot;de Ville&quot;.

=== Sedanca / Sedanca de ville / Sedanca coupé===

The terms &quot;sedanca&quot; and &quot;sedanca de ville&quot; were introduced by Spanish nobleman Count Carlos de Salamanca, the Spanish distributor for Rolls-Royce, in 1923. The strict definition of a sedanca includes a locker for the cant rails and canopy that form the roof; this was introduced by Count de Salamanca in his original sedanca.

Usage of these terms in the United Kingdom is unclear. According to once source, &quot;sedanca de ville&quot; refers to a town car variant, and &quot;sedanca&quot; refers to a sedanca coupé. According to another source, &quot;sedanca de ville&quot; is a redundant term and &quot;sedanca&quot; refers to a town car.
=== Coupé de ville ===
In France, Germany and Italy, the term &quot;coupé de ville&quot; was used for both the town car and sedanca coupé variants.
In the United States, the similar term &quot;coupé de ville&quot; is used for the Sedanca Coupé. A coupé de ville is alternatively defined in North America as a drophead coupé with a three-position top which may be fully closed, fully open, or partially closed, leaving rear passengers covered.

=== Cabriolet-Victoria ===
In the United Kingdom, a sedanca-style drophead coupé with three-position folding top (fully open, covering the rear passengers only, or fully closed) is called a &quot;cabriolet victoria&quot;. This variant is defined as a coupé de ville in the United States.

=== Coupé chauffeur ===

French variant 
=== Coupé limousine ===
French variant similar to the &quot;coupé chauffeur&quot; but with a longer passenger compartment capable of holding up to seven passengers, with up to three on jump seats usually facing forward. The style was referred to in the United States as a &quot;limousine town car&quot; and in Britain as a &quot;limousine de ville&quot;. The term &quot;Coupé Napoleon&quot; was also used to describe a Bugatti Royale body of the type.
=== Brougham ===

The term is derived from the brougham carriage. In strict terms, a brougham would have a sharply squared rear end of the roof and a forward-curving body line at the base of the front of the passenger enclosure. The term degraded during the twentieth century.
==Manufacturer==

===Europe===
Due to its high-end luxurious form, bespoke commissioning and resultant design nature, and final high cost, coupés de ville of both types were hand-built in small numbers. The cars were almost always made as individual (&quot;Full Custom&quot;), or in a small edition with individual equipment (&quot;semi-custom&quot;).

In France, Audineau et Cie., Mulbacher and Rothschild became known for such works.

In the United Kingdom, the style was applied to numerous chassis by the various specialist coachwork builders, but it is most often associated via the 4-door Sedanca de Ville variant with Rolls-Royce motor cars, and the 2-door sporting Sedanca variant with Bentleys. Coachbuilders included Barker, Hooper, H. J. Mulliner and Park Ward.

===North America===
====Coachbuilt====
Due to its historic and luxurious connections, the term town car found early favour amongst many North America automobile manufacturers. The most luxurious were handbuilt by coachbuilders on rolling chassis provided by prestige automakers, such as Packards and North American-built Rolls-Royces bodied by Brewster &amp; Co., and various Cadillacs, Lincolns, Packards, and others by LeBaron and Rollston. Brewster also sold a limited line of automobiles under its own name.

In 1922, Edsel Ford had a Lincoln built with a town car body for his father&#x27;s personal use.

Seeking publicity and building on his work with Studebaker, Raymond Loewy had two Lincoln Continentals altered to coupés de ville in 1946 using a removable plexiglas cover over the chauffeur.

====Production====

Ford introduced a town car body to its Model A line in December 1928. Designed by LeBaron and designated the 140-A, the Model A town car was sold until early 1930. 1,065 Model A town cars were built by the end of production in 1930.

In 1940 and 1941, a limited edition model of the Cadillac Sixty Special carried the Town Car name. It was reintroduced as a coupe hardtop in 1949 using the French name for the body style Coupe DeVille and in 1956 as a four-door hardtop called the Sedan DeVille.
==Current use as model name==
Production of cars with the coupe de ville body style ceased in 1939. However, car manufacturers in the United States have continued to release models called &quot;coupe de ville&quot;, &quot;sedanca de ville&quot; and &quot;town car&quot; despite the cars having other body styles; for example the 1959 Lincoln Continental Town Car has a sedan body style.

<text>Howard Charles Green (November 5, 1895 – June 26, 1989) was a Canadian federal politician.

==Opposition career==
He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1935 federal election as a Conservative from Vancouver, British Columbia in the election which saw the defeat of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett&#x27;s government. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for 28 years. Between his first election in 1935 and the 1949 federal election he was MP for the riding of Vancouver South. From 1949 until he was voted out of office, he represented the riding of Vancouver Quadra.

In 1942, he was a candidate at the party&#x27;s leadership convention, and placed fourth. At the same convention, the Conservative Party changed its name to the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

In 1946, after the sudden death of Royal Maitland, the leader of the British Columbia Progressive Conservatives, Green was courted for the job. Green&#x27;s leadership would have solved a political problem: under the party&#x27;s coalition agreement with the Liberal Party, the Conservatives were entitled to the ministerial portfolio of Attorney General, but the party had no other lawyers in caucus; Green, a barrister, would be suited to the job. However, Premier John Hart got around the problem by appointing a Liberal as attorney general while naming two more Tories to cabinet. With the post of attorney general no longer available, Green declined to seek the leadership.

Green was a fierce critic of Louis St. Laurent and Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s actions in the Suez Crisis. In the debate upon Pearson&#x27;s return from the United Nations, Green said the Liberal government &quot;by its actions in the Suez crisis, has made this month of November 1956, the most disgraceful period for Canada in the history of this nation,&quot; and that it was &quot;high time Canada had a government which will not knife Canada&#x27;s best friends in the back.&quot;

==Ministerial offices==
When John Diefenbaker became prime minister after a surprise victory in the 1957 Canadian federal election, Green became Minister of Public Works. He became Secretary of State for External Affairs in 1959 following the death of Sidney Earle Smith.

===Anti-nuclear stance===
He was a strong supporter of the Commonwealth of Nations and advocated nuclear disarmament, backing Diefenbaker&#x27;s position against having Canada accept nuclear-tipped Bomarc missiles—a position that led to the resignation of several ministers and contributed to the fall of the Diefenbaker government. He helped promote the country&#x27;s international role until he was defeated along with the Tory government in the 1963 federal election.

<text>The XLR11, company designation RMI 6000C4, was the first liquid-propellant rocket engine developed in the United States for use in aircraft. It was designed and built by Reaction Motors Inc., and used ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen as propellants to generate a maximum thrust of . Each of the four combustion chambers produced of thrust. The engine was not throttleable but each chamber could be turned on and off individually.

==Development==
Development of the engine began in 1943. Reaction Motors called the engine &quot;Black Betsy&quot;, though informally it was referred to as &quot;The Belching Black Bastard&quot;. Its first official designation was the 6000C4, and it was later given the military designation XLR11.

==Operational history==
The XLR11-RM-5 engine was first used in the Bell X-1. On October 14, 1947, the X-1 became the first aircraft to fly faster than the speed of sound (Mach 1). The XLR11-RM-5 was also used in the X-1A and X-1B, and as a booster engine in the U.S. Navy&#x27;s D-558-2 Douglas Skyrocket turbojet (where it was designated the XLR8-RM-5).

In 1959 and 1960, while development of a more powerful engine was still under way, a pair of XLR11-RM-13&#x27;s were used as an interim power plant for the initial flights of the X-15 research aircraft. These engines were boosted to of thrust per chamber for a total of . In comparison, the thrust of the X-15&#x27;s XLR99 engine could be varied from . After 24 powered flights, the XLR11 engines were replaced by the new XLR99 engine in November 1960.

The XLR11-RM-13 was also used in the Dryden lifting bodies, and as a booster engine in the Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor turbojet.

<doc id="542903" wikidata="Q7156301" url="?curid=542903" title="Pawnee Rock">
<text>Pawnee Rock, one of the most famous landmarks on the Santa Fe Trail, is located in Pawnee Rock State Park, just north of Pawnee Rock, Kansas, United States. Originally over tall, railroad construction stripped it of some 15 to in height for road bed material.
A memorial monument, picnic area, and pergola have been constructed on the top. From the top of the pergola is a view the Arkansas River valley and the route of the Santa Fe trail.
Today it is a prominence rising above the surrounding plains. Matt Field, who traveled the Santa Fe Trail in 1840, later wrote, &quot;Pawnee Rock springs like a huge wart from the carpeted green of the prairie.&quot; Traders, soldiers, and emigrants who stopped, carved their names into the brown sandstone. Some of these names are still visible among the markings of the more recent visitors.

Pawnee Rock was added to the National Register of Historic Places around 1970. The site is administrated by the Kansas Historical Society as the Pawnee Rock State Historic Site.

==History==
Pawnee Rock was long a meeting place of the Comanche, Kiowa, Arapaho and Cheyenne Indians. Numerous battles were fought at Pawnee Rock between the tribes, and as a result, many bones have been found in the soil in the vicinity.
Pawnee Rock was for many years a place where Comanche, Kiowa, Arapaho, Cheyenne, and Pawnee tribes held their councils of war and peace. Many Indian battles were fought nearby in the days before the white men came to Kansas.

It served as a lookout for travelers on the Santa Fe Trail, as well as a rendezvous and ambush for the Indians. As a camping spot it afforded some protection against hostile Indians. Many travelers and traders on the Santa Fe trail considered Pawnee Rock the most dangerous place on the Central Plains for encounters with the Indians.
Many of the Plains tribes reportedly used it as an observation point from which they could track and swoop down upon buffalo herds and wagon trains. It was also a landmark for travelers, marking the half waypoint between Missouri and Santa Fe. In 1848, James Birch, a soldier on his way to the Mexican War, wrote: &quot;Pawnee Rock was covered with names carved by the men who had passed it. It was so full that I could find no place for mine.&quot; .

Much of Pawnee Rock was destroyed in the 1870s by the railroad and by settlers for building stone. The remnant was acquired in 1908 by the Woman&#x27;s Kansas Day Club. In 1909, was given to the State of Kansas as an historic site. On May 24, 1912, a stone monument was dedicated with great celebration before a crowd of some 8,000 onlookers. Pawnee Rock was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and today operates as Pawnee Rock State Historic Site.

==Naming Pawnee Rock==
Many stories have been told to explain how Pawnee Rock got its name. One source for the name comes from the belief that was sacred ground for the Pawnee Indians who held tribal councils on its flat top. Another from a great battle in which a small band of Pawnees were destroyed by a force of Kiowas, Cheyennes, and Arapahos. Both come from Pawnee lore. Among the plainsmen it is said that the Rock got its name in 1826. Kit Carson was on his first trip west and only seventeen. He was working his passage on a wagon train which near the Rock. While on guard duty, he shot his own mule, thinking it was an attacking Pawnee. His associates commemorated his experience with the name, Pawnee Rock.

<text>Norman Duncan Kemp Smith, FBA, FRSE (5 May 1872 – 3 September 1958) was a Scottish philosopher who was Professor of Psychology (1906–1914) and Philosophy (1914–1919) at Princeton University and was Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh (1919–1945).

Smith is noted for his 1929 English translation of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, which for a long time was considered the standard version.

==Early life and education==
Norman Smith was born on 5 May 1872 in Dundee, Scotland, the son of a cabinet-maker on the Nethergate. He was educated in Dundee and then studied mental philosophy at the University of St Andrews, graduating with an MA with first-class honours in 1893. He received his doctorate (PhD) in 1902.

==Career==
Smith lectured in philosophy and psychology at Princeton University from 1906 to 1916, and at the University of Edinburgh from 1919 until his retirement in 1945. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1921. His proposers were Ralph Allan Sampson, Thomas James Jehu, Charles Glover Barkla and Charles Sarolea. In 1932 he delivered the Adamson Lecture of the Victoria University of Manchester.

In 1938 he moved to 14 Kilgraston Road in south Edinburgh, a house designed by Sir Robert Matthew.

His translation of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; is often used as the standard English version of the text. His commentaries on the &quot;Critique&quot; are also well regarded, as are his works on David Hume and other philosophers. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1947 to 1948. A portrait by the Edinburgh artist Adam Bruce Thomson is held by the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s Fine Art Collection.

Kemp Smith died on 3 September 1958 in Edinburgh.

==Family==

In 1910 he married Amy Kemp (d.1936), and thereafter became known as Norman Kemp Smith.

==Legacy==
The Kemp Smith Room in the University of Edinburgh&#x27;s Philosophy Department is named in his honour.

<doc id="542922" wikidata="Q636870" url="?curid=542922" title="Tintin in the Congo">
<text>Tintin in the Congo (; ) is the second volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian comic strip artist Hergé. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children&#x27;s supplement , it was serialised weekly from May 1930 to June 1931 before being published in a collected volume by Éditions de Petit Vingtième in 1931. The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who are sent to the Belgian Congo to report on events in the country. Amid various encounters with the native Congolese people and wild animals, Tintin unearths a criminal diamond smuggling operation run by the American gangster Al Capone.

Following on from &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; and bolstered by publicity stunts, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; was a commercial success within Belgium and was also serialised in France. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;Tintin in America&quot; in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; in his distinctive &quot;ligne-claire&quot; style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made at the request of his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.

In the late 20th century, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; became increasingly controversial for both its racist colonial attitude toward Congolese people and for its glorification of big-game hunting. Accordingly, attempts were made in Belgium, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States to either ban the work or restrict its availability to children. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, with commentators on &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; describing it as one of Hergé&#x27;s lesser works.

==Synopsis==
Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy travel to the Belgian Congo (present day: Democratic Republic of the Congo), where a cheering crowd of native Congolese greet them. Tintin hires a native boy, Coco, to assist him in his travels, and soon thereafter Tintin rescues Snowy from a crocodile. A criminal stowaway tries to kill Tintin, but monkeys throw coconuts at the stowaway that knock him unconscious. A monkey kidnaps Snowy, but Tintin saves him by disguising himself as another monkey. That night, the stowaway escapes.

The next morning, Tintin, Snowy, and Coco crash their car into a train, which the reporter fixes and tows to the village of the Babaorum tribe. He meets the king, who invites him to a hunt the next day. A lion knocks Tintin unconscious, but Snowy rescues him by biting off its tail. Tintin gains the admiration of the natives, making the Babaorum witch-doctor Muganga jealous. With the help of the criminal stowaway, Muganga accuses Tintin of destroying the tribe&#x27;s sacred idol. The enraged villagers imprison Tintin, but then turn against Muganga when Tintin shows them footage of the witch-doctor and the stowaway conspiring to destroy the idol. Tintin becomes a hero in the village: when he cures a man using quinine, he is hailed as a &quot;Boula Matari&quot; (&quot;Breaker of rocks&quot;) and a local woman bows down to him, saying, &quot;White man very great! Has good spirits ... White mister is big juju man!&quot; Angered, Muganga starts a war between the Babaorum and their enemies, the M&#x27;Hatuvu, whose king leads an attack on the Babaorum village. Tintin outwits them, and the M&#x27;Hatuvu cease hostilities and come to idolise Tintin. Muganga and the stowaway plot to kill Tintin and make it look like a leopard attack, but Tintin survives and saves Muganga from a boa constrictor; Muganga pleads mercy and ends his hostilities. 

The stowaway again attempts to kill Tintin, binding him and hanging him from a tree branch over a river to be eaten by crocodiles, but he is rescued by a passing Catholic missionary, who invites Tintin to go on an elephant hunt. Then, disguised as a missionary, the stowaway captures Tintin again, leaving him tied up in a boat set to go over a waterfall, but the Catholic priest once again saves him. Tintin confronts the stowaway and they fight over a cliff, where the latter is eaten by crocodiles. After reading a letter from the stowaway&#x27;s pocket, Tintin finds that someone called &quot;A.C.&quot; has ordered his elimination. Tintin captures a criminal who tried to rendezvous with the stowaway and learns that &quot;A.C.&quot; is none other than the American gangster Al Capone, who is trying to gain control of African diamond production. Tintin and the colonial police arrest the rest of the diamond smuggling gang and after having a few more adventures with different animals, Tintin and Snowy return to Belgium.

==History==
===Background===
Georges Remi—best known under the pen name Hergé—was the editor and illustrator of (&quot;&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;), a children&#x27;s supplement to (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;&quot;), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé&#x27;s native Brussels. Run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez, the paper described itself as a &quot;Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information&quot; and disseminated a far-right, fascist viewpoint. According to Harry Thompson, such political ideas were common in Belgium at the time, and Hergé&#x27;s milieu was permeated with conservative ideas revolving around &quot;patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline, and naivety&quot;.

In 1929, Hergé began &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic strip for , a series about the exploits of a fictional Belgian reporter named Tintin. Following the success of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, serialised weekly in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; from January 1929 to May 1930, Hergé wanted to send Tintin to the United States. Wallez insisted he write a story set in the Belgian Congo, then a Belgian colony and today the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Belgian children learned about the Congo in school, and Wallez hoped to encourage colonialist and missionary zeal in his readership. He believed that the Belgian colonial administration needed promotion at a time when memories &quot;were still fairly fresh&quot; of the 1928 visit to the colony by the Belgian King Albert and Queen Elisabeth. He also hoped that some of his readers would be inspired to work in the Congo.

Hergé characterised Wallez&#x27;s instructions in a sarcastic manner, saying Wallez referred to the Congo as &quot;our beautiful colony which has great need of us, tarantara, tarantaraboom&quot;. He already had some experience in illustrating Congolese scenes; three years previously, Hergé had provided two illustrations for the newspaper that appeared in an article celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s expedition to the Congo. In one of these, Hergé depicted a native Congolese bowing before a European, a scene that he repeated in &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;.

As in &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot;, where Hergé had based his information about the Soviet Union almost entirely on a single source, in &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; he used limited source material to learn about the country and its people. He based the story largely on literature written by missionaries, with the only added element being that of the diamond smugglers, possibly adopted from the &quot;&quot;Jungle Jim&quot;-type serials&quot;. Hergé visited the Colonial Museum of Tervuren, examining their ethnographic collections of Congolese artefacts, including costumes of the Leopard Men. He adopted hunting scenes from André Maurois&#x27;s novel &quot;The Silence of Colonel Bramble&quot;, while his animal drawings were inspired by Benjamin Rabier&#x27;s prints. He also listened to tales of the colony from some of his colleagues who had been there, but disliked their stories, later claiming: &quot;I didn&#x27;t like the colonists, who came back bragging about their exploits. But I couldn&#x27;t prevent myself from seeing the Blacks as big children, either&quot;.

===Original publication, 1930–31===

&quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; was serialised under the French title of &quot;Tintin au Congo&quot; in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; from 5 June 1930 to 11 June 1931; it was syndicated to the French Catholic newspaper &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;. Drawn in black and white, it followed the same formula employed in &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot;, remaining &quot;essentially plotless&quot; according to the Hergé specialist Michael Farr, and consisting of largely unrelated events that Hergé improvised each week. Hergé later commented on the process of writing these early adventures, stating: &quot;The came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn&#x27;t have a clue on Wednesday morning how I was going to get Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week&quot;. The strip&#x27;s visual style was similar to that of &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot;. In the first instalment of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, Hergé featured Quick and Flupke, two young boys from Brussels whom he had recently introduced in another &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; comic strip, in the crowd of people saying goodbye to Tintin.

Like &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot;, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; was popular in Belgium. On the afternoon of 9 July 1931, Wallez repeated the publicity stunt he had used when &quot;Soviets&quot; ended by having a young actor, Henry de Doncker, dress up as Tintin in colonial gear and appear in Brussels and then Liège, accompanied by 10 African bearers and an assortment of exotic animals hired from a zoo. Co-organised with the Bon Marché department store, the event attracted 5,000 spectators in Brussels. In 1931, Brussels-based Éditions de Petit Vingtième collected the story together into a single volume, and Casterman published a second edition in 1937. By 1944 the book had been reprinted seven times, and had outsold each of the other seven books in the series. The series&#x27; success led Wallez to renegotiate Hergé&#x27;s contract, giving him a higher salary and the right to work from home.

===Second version, 1946===
In the 1940s, after Hergé&#x27;s popularity increased, he redrew many of the original black-and-white Tintin stories in colour using the (&quot;clear line&quot;) drawing style he had developed, so that they fitted in visually with the newer &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; that he had produced. Hergé first made some changes in this direction in 1940, when the story was serialised in the Dutch-language &quot;Het Laatste Nieuws&quot;.

At Casterman&#x27;s prompting, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; was subsequently fully re-drawn, and the new version was published in 1946. As a part of this modification, Hergé cut the page length from 110 plates to the standard 62 pages, as suggested by the publisher Casterman. He also made several changes to the story, cutting many of the references to Belgium and colonial rule. For example, in the scene where Tintin teaches Congolese school children about geography, he states in the 1930–31 version: &quot;My dear friends, today I&#x27;m going to talk to you about your country: Belgium!&quot; whereas in the 1946 version, he instead gives them a mathematics lesson. Hergé also changed the character of Jimmy MacDuff, the owner of the leopard that attacks Tintin, from a black manager of the Great American Circus into a white &quot;supplier of the biggest zoos in Europe&quot;.

In the 1946 colour version, Hergé added a cameo appearance from Thomson and Thompson, the two detectives that he had introduced in the fourth Tintin story, &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; (1932–34), which was chronologically set after the Congolese adventure. Adding them to the first page, Hergé featured them in the backdrop, watching a crowd surrounding Tintin as he boards a train and commenting that it &quot;Seems to be a young reporter going to Africa ...&quot; In the same frame, Hergé inserted depictions of himself and his friend Edgar P. Jacobs (the book&#x27;s colourist) into the crowd seeing Tintin off.

===Later alterations and releases===

When &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; was first released by the series&#x27; Scandinavian publishers in 1975, they objected to page 56, where Tintin drills a hole into a live rhinoceros, fills it with dynamite, and blows it up. They asked Hergé to replace this page with a less violent scene, which they believed would be more suitable for children. Hergé agreed, as he regretted the scenes of big-game hunting in the work soon after producing it. The altered page involved the rhinoceros running away unharmed after accidentally knocking down and triggering Tintin&#x27;s gun.

Although publishers worldwide had made it available for many years, English publishers refused to publish &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; because of its perceived racist content. In the late 1980s, Nick Rodwell, then agent of Studios Hergé in the United Kingdom, told reporters of his intention to finally publish it in English and stated his belief that publishing the original 1931 black and white edition would cause less controversy than releasing the 1946 colour version. After more delay, in 1991—sixty years after its original 1931 publication—it was the last of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to see publication in English. The 1946 colour version eventually appeared in English in 2005, published in Britain by Egmont.

==Critical analysis==
Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline believed that Hergé&#x27;s drawing became more assured throughout the first version of the story without losing any of its spontaneity. He thought that the story began in &quot;the most inoffensive way&quot;, and that throughout the story Tintin was portrayed as a Boy Scout, something he argued reflected Hergé&#x27;s &quot;moral debt&quot; to Wallez. Biographer Benoît Peeters opined that &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; was &quot;nothing spectacular&quot;, with some &quot;incredibly cumbersome&quot; monologues, but he thought the illustrations &quot;a bit more polished&quot; than those in &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot;. Believing the plot to be &quot;extremely simple&quot;, he thought that Tintin&#x27;s character was like a child manipulating a world populated by toy animals and lead figurines. Michael Farr felt that, unlike the previous Tintin adventure, some sense of a plot emerges at the end of the story with the introduction of the American diamond-smuggling racket. Philippe Goddin thought the work to be &quot;more exciting&quot; than &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot; and argued that Hergé&#x27;s depiction of the native Congolese was not mocking but a parody of past European militaries. By contrast, Harry Thompson believed that &quot;&quot;Congo&quot; is almost a regression from &quot;Soviets&quot;&quot;, in his opinion having no plot or characterisation; he described it as &quot;probably the most childish of all the Tintin books&quot;. Simon Kuper of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; criticised both &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot; and &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; as the &quot;worst&quot; of the &quot;Adventures&quot;, opining that they were &quot;poorly drawn&quot; and &quot;largely plot-free&quot;.

Farr saw the 1946 colour version as poorer than the black and white original; he said it had lost its &quot;vibrancy&quot; and &quot;atmosphere&quot;, and that the new depiction of the Congolese landscape was unconvincing and more like a European zoo than the &quot;parched, dusty expanses of reality&quot;. Peeters took a more positive attitude towards the 1946 version, commenting that it contained &quot;aesthetic improvements&quot; and &quot;clarity of composition&quot; because of Hergé&#x27;s personal development in draughtsmanship, as well as an enhancement in the dialogue, which had become &quot;more lively and fluid&quot;.

In his psychoanalytical study of the series, Jean-Marie Apostolidès highlighted that in the Congolese adventure, Tintin represented progress and the Belgian state was depicted as a model for the natives to imitate. In doing so, he argued, they could become more European and thus civilised from the perspective of Belgian society, but that instead they ended up appearing as parodies. Opining that Tintin was imposing his own view of Africa onto the Congolese, Apostolidès remarked that Tintin appeared as a god-figure, with evangelical overtones in the final scene. Literary critic Tom McCarthy concurred that Tintin represented the Belgian state, but also suggested that he acted as a Christian missionary, even being &quot;a kind of god&quot; akin to the character of Kurtz in Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (1899). McCarthy compared the scene where Tintin exposes Muganga as a fraud to that in which the character of Prospero exposes the magician in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

==Criticism==
===Racism===

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several campaigners and writers characterised &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; as racist due to its portrayal of the Congolese as infantile and stupid. According to McCarthy, Hergé depicted the Congolese as &quot;good at heart but backwards and lazy, in need of European mastery&quot;. There had been no such controversy when originally published, because it was only following the decolonisation of Africa, which occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, that Western attitudes towards indigenous Africans shifted. Harry Thompson argued that &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; must be viewed in the context of European society in the 1930s and 1940s, and that Hergé had not written the book to be &quot;deliberately racist&quot;. Thompson argued that the story reflected the average Belgian view of Congolese people at the time, one that was more &quot;patronising&quot; than malevolent. Apostolidès supported this idea, as did Peeters, who asserted that &quot;Hergé was no more racist than the next man&quot;. After meeting Hergé in the 1980s, Farr commented, &quot;You couldn&#x27;t have met someone who was more open and less racist.&quot;

Contrastingly, Assouline stated that in 1930s Belgium, Hergé would have had access to literature by the likes of André Gide and Albert Londres that was critical of the colonial regime. Assouline claimed that Hergé instead chose not to read such reports because they conflicted with the views of his conservative milieu. Laurence Grove—President of the International &quot;Bande Dessinée&quot; Society and an academic at the University of Glasgow—concurred, remarking that Hergé adhered to prevailing societal trends in his work, and that &quot;[w]hen it was fashionable to be a colonial racist, that&#x27;s what he was&quot;. Comic book historian Mark McKinney noted that other Franco-Belgian comic artists of the same period had chosen to depict the native Africans in a more favourable light, citing the examples of Jijé&#x27;s 1939 work &quot;Blondin et Cirage&quot; (&quot;Blondy and Shoe-Black&quot;), in which the protagonists are adopted brothers, one white, the other black, and &quot;Tif et Tondu&quot;, which was serialised in &quot;Spirou&quot; from 1939 to 1940 and in which the Congolese aid the Belgians against their American antagonists.

Farr and McCarthy stated that &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; was the most popular Tintin adventure in Francophone Africa. According to Thompson, the book remained hugely popular in the Congo even after the country achieved independence in 1960. Nevertheless, government figures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have criticised the book. In 2004, after the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel De Gucht described President Joseph Kabila&#x27;s provisional DRC government as incompetent, Congolese Information Minister Henri Mova Sakanyi accused him of &quot;racism and nostalgia for colonialism&quot;, remarking that it was like &quot;&quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; all over again&quot;. The South African comics writer Anton Kannemeyer has parodied the perceived racist nature of the book to highlight what he sees as the continuing racist undertones of South African society. In his &quot;Pappa in Afrika&quot; (2010), a satire of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, he portrays Tintin as an Afrikaner with racist views of indigenous Africans.

====Attempts to ban or restrict access to the book====

In August 2007, Congolese student Bienvenu Mbutu Mondondo filed a complaint in Brussels, claiming that &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; was an insult to the Congolese people that should be banned. Public prosecutors initiated a criminal case although the matter was transferred to a civil court in April 2010. Mondondo called the comic &quot;racist and xenophobic,&quot; while his lawyers argued that it amounted to &quot;a justification of colonisation and of white supremacy&quot;. Alain Berenboom, lawyer for both Moulinsart, the company which controls Hergé&#x27;s estate, and Casterman, the book&#x27;s publisher, argued that the cartoonist&#x27;s depiction of the Congolese &quot;wasn&#x27;t racism but kind paternalism&quot;. Berenboom said that banning it would set a dangerous precedent for the availability of literature by other historical authors, such as Charles Dickens or Jules Verne, which also contain stereotypes of non-white ethnicities. In February 2012 the court ruled that the book would not be banned, deciding that it was &quot;clear that neither the story, nor the fact that it has been put on sale, has a goal to ... create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, or humiliating environment&quot;, and that it therefore did not break Belgian law. Belgium&#x27;s Centre for Equal Opportunities warned against &quot;over-reaction and hyper political correctness&quot;.

In July 2007, British human rights lawyer David Enright complained to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) that the book was sold in the children&#x27;s section of Borders bookshop. The CRE called on bookshops to remove the comic; responding that it was committed to letting its &quot;customers make the choice&quot;, Borders moved the book to an area reserved for adult graphic novels. UK bookseller Waterstone&#x27;s followed suit. Another British retailer, WHSmith, said that the book was sold on its website, but with a label that recommended it for readers aged 16 and over. The CRE&#x27;s attempt to ban the book was criticised by Conservative Party politician Ann Widdecombe, who remarked that the organisation had more important things to do than regulate the availability of historical children&#x27;s books. The media controversy increased interest in the book, and Borders reported that its sales of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; had been boosted 4,000%, while it also rose to eighth on the Amazon.com bestseller list. Publisher Egmont UK also responded to racism concerns by placing a protective band around the book with a warning about its content and writing an introduction describing its historical context.

&quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; also came under criticism in the United States; in October 2007, in response to a complaint by a patron, the Brooklyn Public Library in New York City placed the graphic novel in a locked back room, only permitting access by appointment. &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; became part of a drawn-out media debate in Sweden after national newspaper &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; reported on the book&#x27;s removal from a children&#x27;s library in Kulturhuset in Stockholm in September 2011. The incident, nicknamed &quot;Tintin-gate&quot;, led to heated discussions in mainstream and social media concerning accusations of racism and censorship. Complaints about the availability of the book in Sweden were also voiced by the Swedish-Belgian Jean-Dadaou Monyas, supported by Afrosvenskarna, an interest group for Swedes of African descent. The complaint to the Chancellor of Justice was turned down as violations of hate speech restrictions in the Swedish Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression must be filed within one year of publication, and the latest Swedish edition of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; appeared in 2005.

===Hunting and animal cruelty===
&quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; shows Tintin taking part in what Farr described as &quot;the wholesale and gratuitous slaughter&quot; of animals; over the course of the Adventure, Tintin shoots several antelope, kills an ape to wear its skin, rams a rifle vertically into a crocodile&#x27;s open mouth, kills an elephant for ivory, stones a buffalo, and (in earlier editions) drills a hole into a rhinoceros before planting dynamite in its body, blowing it up from the inside. Such scenes reflect the popularity of big-game hunting among affluent visitors in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1930s. Hergé later felt guilty about his portrayal of animals in &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; and became an opponent of blood sports; when he wrote &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; (1934), he had Tintin befriend a herd of elephants living in the Indian jungle.

Philippe Goddin stated that the scene in which Tintin shoots a herd of antelope was &quot;enough to upset even the least ecological reader&quot; in the 21st century. When India Book House first published the book in India in 2006, its national branch of the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals issued a public criticism, and chief functionary Anuradha Sawhney stated that the book was &quot;replete with instances that send a message to young minds that it is acceptable to be cruel to animals&quot;.

<text>The Keya Paha River ( ) is a river flowing through the U.S. states of South Dakota and Nebraska.

The name is derived from the Dakota language &quot;ke&#x27;-ya pa-ha″&quot;, meaning &quot;turtle hill&quot;, specifically Turtle Butte. The river&#x27;s name was given to Keya Paha County, Nebraska, through which it flows.

The river originates in Todd County in south central South Dakota, at the confluence of Antelope Creek and Rock Creek near the town of Hidden Timber. It flows in a generally southeasterly direction through Todd and Tripp counties in South Dakota and then through Keya Paha and Boyd counties in Nebraska. It ends at its confluence with the Niobrara River about west of Butte, Nebraska. The river has a year-round flow, except for winter ice, and has a quality of water better than all other South Dakota rivers.

In 1861, the border between the Nebraska and Dakota territories followed the Keya Paha River from the 43rd parallel to the river&#x27;s confluence with the Niobrara; it then followed the Niobrara to Missouri. This situation lasted until 1882 when the boundary was changed to follow the 43rd parallel all the way to Missouri; the change added portions of Keya Paha and Boyd counties to Nebraska.

==Discharge==
At a gaging station south of Naper in Boyd County, the river&#x27;s mean discharge was . The maximum mean annual discharge was , recorded in 1962; the minimum mean annual discharge was , recorded in 1976. The peak flow recorded at that point was , registered on July 1, 1962. From July 22 to July 30, 1976, the discharge was recorded as zero.

<text>The Black Island () is the seventh volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper for its children&#x27;s supplement , it was serialised weekly from April to November 1937. The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who travel to England in pursuit of a gang of counterfeiters. Framed for theft and hunted by detectives Thomson and Thompson, Tintin follows the criminals to Scotland, discovering their lair on the Black Island.

&quot;The Black Island&quot; was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1943, &quot;The Black Island&quot; was coloured and re-drawn in Hergé&#x27;s distinctive style for republication. In the mid-1960s, Hergé&#x27;s British publishers requested a major revision of the story, for which he sent his assistant Bob De Moor to Britain on a research trip; on his return, Studios Hergé produced a revised, third edition of the story, serialised in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. &quot;The Black Island&quot; introduces the recurring villain Dr. Müller, and has been widely cited as one of the most popular instalments in the series. The story was adapted for the 1957 Belvision animation &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1980–81 West End play &quot;Tintin and the Black Island&quot;, the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, and the 1992–93 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Tintin witnesses a plane land in the Belgian countryside experiencing engine trouble, and is shot by the pilot when he offers his help. While he recovers in hospital, detectives Thomson and Thompson visit him and inform him that the plane subsequently flew to Sussex, England, where it crashed. Tintin and Snowy proceed to Sussex, but along the way, while onboard a train two criminals frame Tintin for robbery, and he is arrested by Thomson and Thompson; he escapes, but is pursued by the detectives. After arriving in England by ferry in Newhaven, both Tintin and the taxi driver are ambushed by the same criminals, who attempt to kill him over the cliffs of Seaford, but he escapes with Snowy&#x27;s help. Discovering the plane wreckage, he finds a torn-up note in the pilot&#x27;s jacket, and following the writing on it arrives at the estate of Dr. J. W. Müller, a German who owns a mental institution, affiliated with the criminals. Tintin and Snowy are chased by a large black and white guard dog, Tintin survives but the guard dog continued chasing Snowy until their chase is over. Müller captures Tintin, but, during a fight, Müller&#x27;s house catches fire. The fire brigade arrives just in time to extinguish the fire and rescue Tintin from the burning house, while Müller escapes with his accomplice Ivan.

The following morning after recovering in hospital, Tintin finds electric cables and red beacons in the garden, surmising that they are there designed to attract a plane drop. At night, he lights the beacons, and a plane drops sacks of counterfeit money, revealing that Müller is part of a gang of forgers. Tintin pursues Müller and Ivan by car and by train across the country. Along the way, Thompson and Thomson try to arrest him again at the pub, but Tintin convinces them to join him in the pursuit of the criminals. When Müller takes a plane north, Tintin and Snowy try to follow, but hit a storm and crash land in rural Scotland in foggy conditions. While Tintin changed into his iconic Scottish outfit, the detectives commandeer another plane, but discover - too late - that the man they told to fly it is actually a mechanic who has never flown before, and after a harrowing air-bound odyssey they end up crash-landing into (and winning) an aerobatics competition.

Tintin and Snowy strolled through the Scottish countryside to see a mountain but Snowy sees a rabbit and they start chasing each other and Snowy gets injured in one of the thorns. 

Learning that Müller&#x27;s plane had crashed off the coast of Kiltoch, a Scottish coastal village, Tintin travels there to continue his investigation. At Kiltoch, an old man tells him the story of Black Island — an island off the coast where a &quot;ferocious beast&quot; kills any visitors. Tintin and Snowy travel to the island, where they find that the &quot;beast&quot; is a trained gorilla named Ranko. Tintin and Snowy walked through the narrow caves and they find the forgers there, With most of the forgers tied up, bound and gagged by Tintin, they further discover that the forgers are using the island as their base, and radio the police for help. Although the forgers attempt to capture Tintin, the police arrive and arrest the criminals. Ranko, who was injured during Tintin&#x27;s attempts to hold off the forgers, becomes docile enough to allow Tintin to bring him to a zoo.

==History==

===Background and research===

Georges Remi—best known under the pen name Hergé—was employed as editor and illustrator of (&quot;&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;), a children&#x27;s supplement to (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;&quot;), a staunchly Roman Catholic, conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé&#x27;s native Brussels which was run by the &quot;Abbé&quot; Norbert Wallez. In 1929, Hergé began &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic strip for , revolving around the exploits of fictional Belgian reporter Tintin. Wallez ordered Hergé to set his first adventure in the Soviet Union as anti-socialist propaganda for children (&quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;), to set his second adventure in the Belgian Congo to encourage colonial sentiment (&quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;), and to set his third adventure in the United States to use the story as a denunciation of American capitalism (&quot;Tintin in America&quot;). Wallez was subsequently removed from the paper&#x27;s editorship following a scandal, although Hergé was convinced to stay on the condition of a salary increase.

For his next serial, Hergé planned to put together a story that caricatured the actions of Nazi Germany, developing the plot for &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;. However, he temporarily set aside that project when he began to experience dreams of white and a car stuck in the snow, having ideas of sending Tintin to the north, considering Greenland or the Klondike as potential locations. The result was &quot;The Black Island&quot;, although Hergé only sent Tintin as far north as Scotland, and he instead used the idea of the car stuck in a snowdrift on a greetings card that he designed. He also had an idea of Tintin combating a group of anarchists bent on destroying Europe&#x27;s iconic buildings, but again this idea did not make it into the eventual story. Having decided to set most of his story in Britain, Hergé briefly visited London and the southern English coast to learn more about the country. There, he purchased a stainless steel Gillott&#x27;s Inqueduct G-2 pen, a type that he would continue to use throughout his life. His positive depiction of Britain was in part due to an Anglophilia that he had received from his childhood, with the British government having been a longstanding ally of Belgium, supporting its 1831 creation and liberating it from German occupation during the First World War.

Hergé retained the anti-German sentiment that he had first considered for &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; through the inclusion of a German villain, Dr. Müller, who would go on to become a recurring character in the Tintin series. He based the character largely on , a Scottish forger who had been a vocal supporter of the Nazi regime, and who he had learned about from a February 1934 article of the anti-conformist Belgian magazine &quot;La Crapouillot&quot; (&quot;The Mortar Shell&quot;). Müller&#x27;s counterfeiting operations were inspired by Bell&#x27;s actions, as he was involved in a plot to destabilise Soviet Russia through counterfeiting Russian roubles. Rather than Germans, Müller&#x27;s henchmen were given the Russian names Ivan and Wronzoff, although the latter would be renamed Puschov by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper for the English translation.
Forging banknotes was a topical crime at the time, while the idea of villains using superstition to hide their lair was a common trope, one that Hergé had used previously in &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;.
The idea of Ranko brought together two popular fictional creatures of the 1930s; the giant ape King Kong, who had been introduced in the film &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933), and the Loch Ness Monster, a cryptid who was to have lived in Loch Ness. Gaston Leroux&#x27;s character of Balaoo the gorilla, who had appeared in a 1911 book and a 1913 film, might also have been an influence on Ranko. The plot and themes of the story were also influenced by Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1935 film &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, itself an adaptation of John Buchan&#x27;s 1915 adventure novel.

===Original publication===
&quot;The Black Island&quot; was first serialised in &quot;Le Petit Vingtième&quot; from 15 April to 16 November 1937 under the title &quot;Le Mystère De L&#x27;Avion Gris&quot; (&quot;The Mystery of the Grey Plane&quot;). From 17 April 1938, the story was also serialised in the French Catholic newspaper, &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;.
In 1938, Éditions Casterman collected the story together in a single hardcover volume, publishing it under the title &quot;L&#x27;Île noire&quot; (&quot;The Black Island&quot;). Hergé however was unhappy with this publication due to errors throughout, most egregiously that the front cover omitted his name.

The inclusion of a television in the original version would have surprised many readers. The BBC had only introduced television to Britain in the late 1930s (suspended entirely until 1946) and Belgium would not have television until 1955.

===Second and third versions===
In the 1940s and 1950s, when Hergé&#x27;s popularity had increased, he and his team at Studios Hergé redrew and coloured many of the original black-and-white Tintin adventures. They used the (&quot;clear line&quot;) drawing style that Hergé had developed, in this way ensuring that the earlier stories fitted in visually alongside the new &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; being created. Casterman published this second, colourised version of the story in 1943, reduced from 124 pages to 60.
This second version contained no significant changes from the original 1937 one, although the black-and-white television screen that had appeared in the 1930s version was now depicted as a colour screen, despite the fact that such technology was not yet available.

In the early 1960s, Hergé&#x27;s English language publishers, Methuen, were planning on translating and publishing &quot;The Black Island&quot; for the British market. Methuen believed that many British readers would find the depiction of Britain in the comic inaccurate and out-of-date, and drew up a list of 131 errors that they asked Hergé to rectify before they would publish it in English. They were also aware that the work would appear particularly dated when compared with some of the most recently published &quot;Adventures&quot; like &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, which made use of advanced technologies in their plot. At the time, Hergé was busy producing the twenty-second Tintin story, &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;, and so did not have the time to undertake research into contemporary British society and culture. Instead, he sent his assistant Bob De Moor to Britain in October 1961, where he visited such sites as Batemans and the White Cliffs of Dover, making many observations as to new developments in clothing and architecture. While in England, De Moor sought out various contemporary uniforms to use as a basis for more accurate illustrations. A police constabulary lent him a police uniform, although when he asked British Rail if he could borrow one of their uniforms, their staff were suspicious and refused.
The new version was serialised in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine from June to December 1965, before Casterman published it in a collected volume in 1966. Studios Hergé made many alterations to the illustrations as a result of De Moor&#x27;s research. Reflecting the fact that television had become increasingly commonplace in Western Europe, Hergé changed the prose from &quot;It&#x27;s a television set!&quot; to &quot;It&#x27;s only a television set!&quot; However, as colour television was not yet available in Britain, the screen on the television encountered in Britain was once again reverted to black-and-white. Additionally, at least one line of dialogue was &quot;softened&quot; from the original version - in one scene where Tintin aims a pistol at two of the counterfeiters, he states, &quot;Get back! And put up your hands!&quot; compared to the original&#x27;s &quot;One more step and you&#x27;re dead!&quot;. The counterfeit notes that Tintin finds were also increased in value, from one pound to five pounds. The multiple aircraft featured throughout the story were redrawn by Studios member Roger Leloup, who replaced the depiction of planes that were operational in the 1930s to those active at the time, such as a Percival Prentice, a D.H. Chipmunk, a Cessna 150, a Tiger Moth, and a British European Airways Hawker Siddeley Trident.

The clothing worn by characters was brought up-to-date, while the old steam locomotives that were initially featured were replaced by more modern diesel or electrified alternatives. Adverts for the genuine Johnnie Walker whisky were replaced by adverts for the fictional in-universe Loch Lomond whisky, while a Sussex County Council signpost was added to page 11. Various English towns and villages were renamed, with Puddlecombe becoming Littlegate, and Eastbury becoming Eastdown, while Scottish pub Ye Dolphin was renamed The Kiltoch Arms. The police were no longer depicted as carrying guns, as was accurate, while the journalists Christopher Willoughby-Drupe and Marco Rizotto, who had first appeared in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; (1963), were retroactively added into the background of one scene.
With the backgrounds and other elements of the new version drawn by staff members of the Studios, the only thing drawn by Hergé in the 1966 version was the characters themselves.

The idea of Tintin travelling to England created a problem for English translators, as Metheun&#x27;s policy had Anglicised the series by moving Tintin&#x27;s home from Brussels to London. In the first act after his wounding by a smuggler pilot, Tintin is originally told by one of the Twins that &quot;We&#x27;re leaving for England.&quot; In English this becomes &quot;We&#x27;re going back to England,&quot; with no explanation as to why all the main characters were in the same continental town simultaneously.

===Later publications===
Casterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of their collection. In 1986, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition, that they followed in 1996 with the publication of a facsimile of the second, 1943 edition.

==Critical analysis==
Harry Thompson thought that &quot;The Black Island&quot; expressed a &quot;convenient, hitherto unsuspected regard for the British&quot; on Hergé&#x27;s behalf, with Britain itself appearing as &quot;a little quaint&quot;. He thought that it &quot;outstrips its predecessors&quot; both artistically and comedically, describing it as &quot;one of the most popular Tintin stories&quot;. He felt that some of the logically implausible slapstick scenes illustrated &quot;the last flicker of 1920s Tintin&quot;, but that the 1966 version was &quot;a fine piece of work and one of the most beautifully drawn Tintin books&quot;. Michael Farr commented on the &quot;distinct quality and special popularity&quot; of &quot;The Black Island&quot;. He thought that the inclusion of many airplanes and a television in the first version was symptomatic of Hergé&#x27;s interest in innovation and modernism. Commenting on the differences between the third version of the comic and the earlier two, he thought that the latter was &quot;strongly representative&quot; of the artistic talents of Studios Hergé in the 1960s, but that it was nevertheless inferior, because it had replaced the &quot;spontaneity and poetry&quot; of the original with &quot;over-detailed and fussily accurate&quot; illustrations.
Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier described &quot;The Black Island&quot; as &quot;a clever little thriller&quot; that bore similarities with the popular detective serials of the era. The Lofficiers thought that the 1966 version &quot;gained in slickness&quot; but became less atmospheric, awarding it two out of five. Biographer Benoît Peeters thought &quot;The Black Island&quot; to be &quot;a pure detective story&quot;, describing it as &quot;Remarkably well constructed&quot; and highlighting that it contrasted the modern world of counterfeiters, airplanes, and television, with the mysteries of superstition and the historic castle. He described it as &quot;an adventure full of twists and turns&quot;, with the characters Thompson and Thomson being &quot;on top form&quot;. He nevertheless considered the 1966 version to be &quot;shorter on charm&quot; than the earlier versions. Elsewhere he was more critical, stating that &quot;under the guise of modernization, a real massacre occurred&quot;, and adding that &quot;the new &quot;Black Island&quot; was more than just a failure; it also showed one of the limitations of the Hergéan system&quot;, in that it was obsessed with repeated redrawing.

Literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University believed that &quot;The Black Island&quot; expanded on a variety of themes that Hergé had explored in his earlier work, such as the idea of counterfeiting and Snowy&#x27;s fondness for whisky. He thought that there was a human-animal link in the story, with Tintin&#x27;s hair matching Snowy&#x27;s fur in a similar manner to how Wronzoff&#x27;s beard matched Ranko&#x27;s fur coat. However, he added that while Tintin&#x27;s relationship with Snowy was wholly one based in good, Wronzoff&#x27;s connection with Ranko is one rooted in evil. By living on an island, Apostolidès thought that Wronzoff was like &quot;a new Robinson Crusoe&quot;, also highlighting that it was the first use of the island theme in Hergé&#x27;s work.
Literary critic Tom McCarthy thought that &quot;The Black Island&quot; linked to Hergé&#x27;s other &quot;Adventures&quot; in various ways; he connected the counterfeit money in the story to the counterfeit idol in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; and the fake bunker in &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;. He also connected Tintin&#x27;s solving of the puzzle in the airman&#x27;s jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or &quot;mort&quot; (death), it linked to Tintin&#x27;s transmitting from the crypt of Marlinspike Hall in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;.

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Black Island&quot; is one of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; that was adapted for the second series of the animated &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot; by the Belgian studio Belvision in 1957. Belvision&#x27;s adaptation, directed by Ray Goossens and written by Michel Greg, divided The Black Island up into 5-minute colour episodes that diverted from Hergé&#x27;s original plot in a variety of ways. The French studio Ellipse and Canadian animation company Nelvana subsequently adapted the comic into a 1991 episode of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; television series. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin.

In 1992, a radio adaption by the BBC was first broadcast on Radio 5. It was produced by John Yorke, Tintin was voiced by Richard Pearce and Snowy by Andrew Sachs.

On 19 March 2010, the British TV network Channel 4 broadcast a documentary titled &quot;Dom Joly and The Black Island&quot; in which the comedian Dom Joly dressed up as Tintin and followed in Tintin&#x27;s footsteps from Ostend to Sussex and then to Scotland. Reviewing the documentary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Tim Dowling commented: &quot;It was amusing in parts, charming in others and a little gift for Tintinophiles everywhere. A Tintinologist, I fear, would not learn much he or she didn&#x27;t already know&quot;.

<text>Isiah Lord Thomas III ( ; born April 30, 1961), also known as &quot;Zeke&quot;, is an American former professional basketball player and coach who is an analyst for NBA TV and Fox Sports. He played his entire professional career for the Detroit Pistons of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Thomas was a two-time NBA champion, an NBA Finals MVP recipient, a five-time All-NBA Team member, a 12-time NBA All-Star with two All-Star Game MVP awards and the 1985 NBA assist leader. He was named to the NBA&#x27;s 50th and 75th anniversary teams, and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000. From 2000 to 2012 he coached the Indiana Pacers, New York Knicks, and FIU.

Thomas played college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers, leading them to the 1981 NCAA championship as a sophomore and declaring for the NBA draft. He was taken as the second overall pick by the Pistons in the 1981 NBA draft, and played for them his entire career, while leading the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; to the 1988–89 and 1989–90 NBA championships.

Following his playing career, Thomas was an executive with the Toronto Raptors, a television commentator, the owner of the Continental Basketball Association, the head coach of the Indiana Pacers, and an executive and head coach for the New York Knicks. He later served as men&#x27;s basketball coach for the Florida International University (FIU) Golden Panthers for three seasons from 2009 to 2012. Thomas was a president and part owner of the Knicks&#x27; WNBA sister team, the New York Liberty, from 2015 to 2019.

==Early life==
Isiah Lord Thomas III is the son of Isiah Thomas II and Mary Thomas. The youngest of 9 children, Thomas was born on April 30, 1961, in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in the city&#x27;s West Side. He started playing basketball at age three and would dribble and shoot baskets as the halftime entertainment at Catholic Youth Organization games.

Thomas&#x27;s father, Isiah Thomas II, was an army veteran wounded in the Battle of Saipan. He later attended trade school, eventually becoming the first black supervisor at International Harvester in Chicago. When the plant closed, the only work he could find was as a janitor; the family fell into hardship. Isiah Thomas II left the family when Isiah was a young child.

Isiah Thomas III attended Our Lady of Sorrows School and St. Joseph High School in Westchester, which was a 20-minute commute from his home. Playing under coach Gene Pingatore, he led St. Joseph to the state finals in his junior year and was considered one of the top college prospects in the country.

==College career==

Thomas was recruited to play college basketball for Bob Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers. Although he received mail saying Knight tied up his players and beat them, he did not believe the rumors. When Knight visited the Thomas home, one of Isiah&#x27;s brothers, who wanted him to attend DePaul, embarrassed him by insulting the Indiana coach and engaging him in a shouting match. Nevertheless, Thomas&#x27;s mother chose Knight and Indiana because she felt that getting away to Bloomington would be good for her son, as would Knight&#x27;s discipline.

Thomas quickly had to adjust to Knight&#x27;s disciplinarian style. At the 1979 Pan American Games in Puerto Rico, Knight got so mad at Thomas he threatened to put him on a plane home. Knight recalled yelling at the freshman-to-be, &quot;You ought to go to DePaul, Isiah, because you sure as hell aren&#x27;t going to be an Indiana player playing like that.&quot; Prior to the start of his freshman year, the 1979–80 season, Knight became so upset with Thomas that he kicked him out of a practice. According to Thomas, Knight was making a point that no player, no &quot;matter how talented, is bigger than Knight&#x27;s philosophy.&quot;

Thomas quickly proved his skills as a player and became a favorite with both Knight and Indiana fans. His superior abilities eventually caused Knight to adjust his coaching style. Fans displayed bedsheets with quotations from the Book of Isaiah (&quot;And a little child shall lead them&quot;) and nicknamed him &quot;Mr. Wonderful.&quot; Because of Thomas&#x27;s relatively short stature for college basketball at , coach Knight would call him &quot;Pee Wee&quot;. Thomas and Mike Woodson led the Hoosiers to the Big Ten championship and advanced to the 1980 Sweet Sixteen.

The next year, the 1980–81 season, Knight made Thomas captain and told him to run the show on the floor. Thomas responded so well that, as the season unfolded, Knight and Thomas grew as friends. When a Purdue player took a cheap shot at Thomas during a game at Bloomington, Knight called a press conference to defend his star. And 19 days later, when Thomas hit an Iowa player and was ejected from a game, Knight refused to criticize him.

That year, Thomas and the Hoosiers once again won a conference title. In addition, the team won the 1981 NCAA tournament, the school&#x27;s fourth national title. The sophomore earned the tournament&#x27;s Most Outstanding Player award and made himself eligible for the upcoming NBA draft.

==Professional career==

=== Detroit Pistons (1981–1994) ===

In the 1981 NBA draft, the Detroit Pistons chose Thomas with the second overall pick and signed him to a four-year, $1.6 million contract. Thomas started for the Eastern Conference in the 1982 NBA All-Star Game and made the All-Rookie Team.

On December 13, 1983, Thomas scored 47 points and recorded 17 assists during a 186–184 triple overtime win over the Denver Nuggets. In the opening round of the 1984 NBA playoffs, Thomas and the Pistons faced off against Bernard King and the New York Knicks. In the pivotal fifth game, Thomas scored 16 points in 94 seconds to force the game into overtime, but then fouled out, and the Knicks held on to win.

In the 1985 NBA playoffs, Thomas and his team went to the conference semifinals against the 15-time NBA champion Boston Celtics led by future Hall of Famers Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, and Dennis Johnson. Detroit would not shake the Celtics in their six-game series, eventually losing.

In the 1987 NBA playoffs, Thomas and the Pistons went to the Eastern Conference Finals and faced the Celtics again. It was the furthest the team had advanced since moving from Fort Wayne. Detroit tied the Celtics at two games apiece, but its hope of winning Game 5 at Boston Garden was dashed by Larry Bird with just seconds remaining: Thomas attempted to quickly inbound the ball, Bird stole the pass and hit Dennis Johnson for the game-winning layup.

In 1988, the Pistons finally defeated the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals and advanced to their first Finals in 32 years, in which many of the Celtics players walked off without shaking hands. Only Kevin McHale, while talking to Isiah can be found shaking hands. That year they faced the Los Angeles Lakers, led by Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Before the series, Thomas and Johnson exchanged a courtside kiss on the cheek prior to tip-off as a sign of their deep friendship. After taking a 3–2 series lead back to Los Angeles, Detroit appeared poised to win their first NBA title in Game 6.

One of Thomas&#x27;s most inspiring and self-defining moments came in Game 6. Although he had severely sprained his ankle late in the game, Thomas continued to play. While hobbling and in obvious pain, Thomas scored 25 points in the third quarter, an NBA Finals record. But the Lakers won the game 103–102 on a pair of last-minute free throws by Abdul-Jabbar, following a controversial foul called on Bill Laimbeer. With Thomas unable to compete at full strength, the Lakers were able to take advantage and clinched their second consecutive title in Game 7, 108–105.

In the 1988–89 season, Thomas, along with teammates Joe Dumars, Rick Mahorn, Vinnie Johnson, Dennis Rodman, James Edwards, John Salley, Bill Laimbeer, and Mark Aguirre, guided his team to a 63–19 record. Detroit played a brash and dominating brand of basketball through the playoffs that led to their nickname &quot;Bad Boys&quot;. First, they defeated Boston, which had been suffering persistent injuries. After being down 2–1 against Michael Jordan and the up-and-coming Chicago Bulls in the Conference Finals, the Pistons utilized the Jordan Rules to limit Jordan&#x27;s impact, which allowed them to defeat the Bulls in six games and advance to the finals yet again, setting up an NBA Finals rematch with the Lakers. This time the Pistons dominated, sweeping the Lakers in four games to win their first of back-to-back championships.
In the 1989–90 season, Thomas and the Pistons had another dominant run. They finished the regular season as the #1 seed for the second straight year. After sweeping the Pacers and defeating the Knicks in five games, Thomas and the Pistons faced a tough seven-game series against the Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Pistons prevailed and advanced to their third straight finals. The Pistons repeated as champions, by defeating Clyde Drexler&#x27;s Portland Trail Blazers. Thomas was voted NBA Finals Most Valuable Player of the 1990 NBA Finals after averaging 27.6 points, 7.0 assists, and 5.2 rebounds per game.

The 1990–91 season proved to be a struggle, as the team went through some injuries, with Thomas only playing 49 games in the regular season because of a wrist injury. The Pistons would win 50 games. Despite advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals, they were no match for a more developed and determined Bulls who swept the two-time defending champions. In the last 7.9 seconds of Game 4, Thomas and most of his teammates walked off the court without shaking any of the Bulls&#x27; hands.

In 1992, the Pistons made it to the playoffs, but were eliminated in five games by the New York Knicks in the first round. In 1993, the Pistons won just 40 games, missing the playoffs for the first time since the 1982–83 season. In the following season, an aging and ailing Thomas tore his Achilles tendon on April 19, 1994, forcing him to retire a month later.

===Rivalries===
In the 1985 NBA All-Star Game, Thomas was joined on the Eastern Conference squad by star rookie Michael Jordan. Jordan wound up attempting nine shots, relatively few for a starting player. Afterward, many veteran East players were accused of having planned to &quot;freeze out&quot; Jordan from their offense by not passing him the ball, supposedly out of spite over the attention Jordan was receiving. No player involved has ever confirmed that the freeze-out occurred, but the story has long been reported. Thomas has ridiculed the idea that he masterminded the supposed freeze-out as &quot;ludicrous&quot;, pointing out that he was a relatively young player on a team that included Larry Bird, Julius Erving and Moses Malone. During Jordan&#x27;s Hall of Fame induction, in which Thomas introduced John Stockton, who was also being inducted, Jordan dismissed the claims about a freeze-out having taken place, saying &quot;I was just happy to be there, being the young guy surrounded by all these greats, I just wanted to prove myself and I hope that I did prove myself to you guys.&quot;

In 1987, following a playoff loss to the Boston Celtics, Thomas was asked if he agreed with Dennis Rodman&#x27;s comments that Larry Bird was overrated because he was white; Thomas agreed that if Bird was Black he &quot;would be just another good guy&quot; instead of being portrayed as the league&#x27;s best player. Thomas later said he was joking and just supporting his teammate.

In the Eastern Conference Finals of the 1991 NBA playoffs, the two-time defending champion Detroit Pistons faced the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls in the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. The Pistons had eliminated the Bulls in each of the three previous years, but this time they suffered a four-game sweep at the hands of the Bulls (who would win the first of three consecutive, and six overall, NBA championships between 1991 and 1998). The series was marked by a number of verbal and physical confrontations. With 7.9 seconds remaining in the fourth game, Laimbeer organized a walk-out and Thomas and all of his teammates—except Joe Dumars and John Salley—walked off the court, refusing to shake hands with the Bulls. Replicating what was done to them by the Celtics teams before. In 1992, Thomas was passed over for the Dream Team apparently because of his strained relationship with Jordan.

In September 2009, during Jordan&#x27;s Hall of Fame acceptance speech, Jordan thanked Thomas and others for giving him the motivation he needed to compete in the NBA.

==National team career==
Thomas was selected to the 1980 Olympic U.S. basketball team, but like all American athletes, he was not able to play in Moscow due to the Olympics boycott. The boycotting countries instead participated in the &quot;Gold Medal Series&quot;, a series of games against NBA teams, a French team and the 1976 Olympic gold medal team in various U.S. cities, recording a 5–1 record (losing only to the Seattle SuperSonics). Thomas shot 22–55 from the field and 14–17 from the line. He led the U.S. in assists with 37 (the next highest total on the team was 17) and averaged 9.7 points per game. In 2007, Thomas received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes.

Despite his talent, Thomas was left off the original Olympic Dream Team, possibly as a result of an alleged feud with Michael Jordan. In the book &quot;When the Game Was Ours&quot;, Magic Johnson relates that he, Jordan and other players conspired to keep Thomas off the Dream Team.

After Tim Hardaway left the team due to injury, Thomas was named to Dream Team II for the 1994 World Championship of Basketball, but did not play due to his Achilles tendon injury that eventually led to his retirement. He was replaced by Kevin Johnson.

==Post-playing career==
===Businessman===
Thomas&#x27;s business career began during his career with the Pistons. Planning for life after the NBA, Thomas invested in a host of ventures through his private investment company out of Michigan, Isiah Investments, LLC. His primary investment was a large chain of printing franchises, American Speedy Printing Centers Inc. Thomas took a very hands-on approach at American Speedy, helping lead the company out of bankruptcy to become profitable and one of the largest printing franchises in the world.

Thomas is the founding chairman and CEO of Isiah International LLC, a holding company with a diverse portfolio of business ventures and investments. Gre3n Waste Removal, Re3 Recycling, and Eleven Capital Group are three of the primary businesses in the Isiah International family of companies.

In 1998, Thomas founded a company serving consumers, retailers, and corporations with online gift certificates and other i-commerce products. Isiah.com also had a partnership with the NBA store.

In April 1999, Thomas became the first African-American elected to the board of governors of the Chicago Stock Exchange. He served until 2002.

In addition to these business ventures, Thomas has been involved in real estate projects in Chicago and the surrounding region as the owner of Isiah Real Estate. In 2013, Thomas said he was putting money in distressed areas and reinvesting: &quot;I&#x27;m hoping I can be a catalyst for change in those areas, to get the population back into those communities and be a catalyst to make a difference.&quot; As of 2015, Thomas was involved in a $300 million development deal for a mixed-use complex at the Illinois Medical District Commission. Isiah Real Estate partnered with Higgins Development Partners, Thomas Samuels Enterprises, and East Lake Management &amp; Development to develop of land that would include retail space, a hotel, apartments and parking areas.

Thomas was one of the founding members of the advisory board for Marquis Jet Partners and a partner of Dale and Thomas Popcorn.

Thomas has served as CEO and executive chairman of the board of directors of One World Products, a cannabis company based in the U.S. with cultivation and processing facilities in Colombia.

===Toronto Raptors===
After his playing career ended, Thomas became part owner and executive vice president of the expansion Toronto Raptors in 1994. In 1998, he left the organization after a dispute with new management over the franchise&#x27;s direction and his future responsibilities. During his tenure with the team, the Raptors drafted Damon Stoudamire, Marcus Camby, and high schooler Tracy McGrady.

===Broadcasting===
After leaving the Raptors, Thomas became a television commentator (first as the lead game analyst with play-by-play man Bob Costas and then as part of the studio team) for the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot;. He also worked a three-man booth with Costas and Doug Collins.

===CBA===
Thomas purchased the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) for $10 million in 1999.

When at the CBA, Thomas launched partnerships with Enlighten Sports and the University of Colorado and the CBA. The new websites allowed fans to watch live game webcasts, use live shot charts, chat with players and more. Thomas said the internet was an &quot;integral part of [the CBA&#x27;s] strategy to provide engaging and entertaining content for fans.&quot; Thomas also launched a partnership between the CBA and SEASONTICKET.com to bring personalized video highlights and scores to fans across the country as well as be a portal for All-Star League voting. Thomas believed that streaming video would be the future of news and entertainment.

During Thomas&#x27;s tenure, the budget for the CBA league office reportedly doubled. When Thomas became head coach of the Indiana Pacers in 2000, he was required by NBA rules to sell the CBA. The NBA offered to buy the league from Thomas, but he declined. The NBA then started its own minor league, depriving the CBA &quot;of its lifeblood, a $2 million annual payment the NBA made to retain the CBA as its official developmental league&quot;. After Thomas placed the league into a blind trust, its funds ran out. In February 2001, the league was forced into bankruptcy and folded.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; asserted that Thomas&#x27;s &quot;foray into league ownership became a case study in how not to run a business&quot;.

===Indiana Pacers (2000–2003)===
Thomas was hired as head coach of the Indiana Pacers on July 20, 2000. He succeeded Larry Bird, who previously coached the Pacers to the Eastern Conference title. Thomas attempted to bring up young talents such as Jermaine O&#x27;Neal, Jamaal Tinsley, Al Harrington, and Jeff Foster. But under Thomas the Pacers were not able to stay at the elite level as they went through the transition from a veteran-dominated, playoff-experienced team to a younger, less experienced team. In Thomas&#x27;s first two seasons with the Pacers, the team was eliminated in the first round by the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Nets, both of whom eventually made the NBA Finals.

In his last year with the Pacers, Thomas guided them to a 48–34 record in the regular season and coached the Eastern Conference team at the 2003 NBA All-Star Game. As the third seed, the Pacers were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the sixth-seeded Boston Celtics. With blossoming talents such as Jermaine O&#x27;Neal, Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Al Harrington and Jamaal Tinsley, along with the veteran leadership of Reggie Miller, some perceived Thomas&#x27;s lack of coaching experience as the Pacers&#x27; stumbling block.

In the off-season, Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations, and his first act was to replace Thomas with Rick Carlisle. Thomas was fired by Bird on August 27, 2003.

===New York Knicks (2006–2008)===
On December 22, 2003, the New York Knicks hired Thomas as president of basketball operations. Thomas was ultimately unsuccessful with the Knicks&#x27; roster and fanbase. At the end of the 2005–06 season, the Knicks had the highest payroll in the league and the second-worst record. He traded away several future draft picks to Chicago in a deal for Eddy Curry including what turned out to be two lottery picks in talent-rich drafts, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Joakim Noah.

In January 2006, Anucha Browne Sanders, a female former executive with the New York Knicks, filed an employment and harassment lawsuit against The Madison Square Garden Company, alleging in part that Thomas had sexually harassed her in the workplace and that she had been fired in retaliation for complaining about the harassment. The case was then settled for $11.5 million.
On June 22, 2006, the Knicks fired coach Larry Brown, and owner James Dolan replaced him with Thomas on the condition that he show &quot;evident progress&quot; or be fired.

During the following season the Knicks became embroiled in a brawl with the Denver Nuggets that Thomas allegedly instigated by ordering his players to commit a hard foul in the paint. He was not fined or suspended; NBA Commissioner David Stern said that he relied only on &quot;definitive information&quot; when handing out punishments. Later in the season, nine months after Dolan had demanded &quot;evident progress&quot;, the Knicks re-signed Thomas to an undisclosed &quot;multi-year&quot; contract. After Thomas was granted the extension, the Knicks abruptly fell from playoff contention with a dismal finish to the season.

During the 2007 NBA draft, Thomas made another trade, acquiring Zach Randolph, Fred Jones, and Dan Dickau from the Portland Trail Blazers for Steve Francis and Channing Frye.

Thomas also compounded the Knicks&#x27; salary-cap problems by signing fringe players such as Jerome James and Jared Jeffries to full mid-level exception contracts. Neither player saw any significant playing time and both were often injured and highly ineffective when able to play.

Despite the constant criticism he received from Knicks fans, Thomas maintained that he had no intention of leaving until he turned the team around. He predicted he would lead the Knicks to a championship, stating that his goal was to leave behind a &quot;championship legacy&quot; with the Knicks just as he had done for the Detroit Pistons.

On April 2, 2008, Donnie Walsh was introduced to replace Thomas as president of basketball operations for the Knicks. One night after the Knicks tied a franchise record of 59 losses and ended their season, news broke that Thomas had been told he would not return as Knicks head coach the following season. He was officially &quot;reassigned&quot; on April 18 &quot;after a season of listless and dreadful basketball, a tawdry lawsuit and unending chants from fans demanding his dismissal&quot;. Thomas posted an overall winning percentage of .341 as head coach of the Knicks, fifth lowest in team history. As part of the reassignment agreement, Thomas was to serve as a consultant to the team, reporting directly to Walsh. He was banned from having contact with Knicks players on the grounds that he could undermine his successor.

===FIU (2009–2012)===
On April 14, 2009, Thomas accepted an offer to become the head basketball coach of FIU, replacing Sergio Rouco after five losing seasons.

After posting a 7–25 record in his first season at FIU, on August 6, 2010, Thomas announced that he was taking a job as consultant to the New York Knicks, while keeping his position as head coach at FIU. According to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, &quot;nearly every major media outlet panned the announcement of Thomas&#x27; hire&quot;, and it led to a &quot;public outcry&quot; among fans. In a reversal on August 11, Thomas announced that he would not be working with the Knicks because holding both jobs violated NBA bylaws.

Thomas finished his second season at FIU with an 11–19 record (5–11 in conference games). On April 6, 2012, FIU fired Thomas after he went 26–65 in three seasons. Under Thomas, FIU never won more than 11 games in a season.

===Back to broadcasting===
On December 19, 2012, NBA TV announced that Thomas would begin work on December 21, 2012, as a member of the studio analyst panel. It was also announced that Thomas would become a regular contributor for NBA.com.

===New York Liberty===
On May 5, 2015, the WNBA New York Liberty hired Thomas as team president, overseeing all of the franchise&#x27;s business and basketball operations. On June 22, 2015, the Liberty and the WNBA agreed to suspend consideration of Thomas&#x27;s ownership application. He remained president of the team.

Under Thomas&#x27;s leadership as team president, and with his former Pistons teammate Bill Laimbeer as head coach, the Liberty finished first in the Eastern Conference during the 2015 season.

Thomas was relieved of his duties with the Liberty on February 21, 2019, after James Dolan sold the Liberty to Joseph Tsai.

===Cheurlin Champagne===
In 2016, Thomas announced that he was the exclusive United States importer of the Cheurlin Champagne brand through ISIAH Imports, a subsidiary of ISIAH International, LLC. Cheurlin Champagne made its debut in the United States at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Other activations have included a private luncheon honoring former President Bill Clinton. In 2017, Cheurlin debuted at The Palace of Auburn Hills for the final season of the Detroit Pistons at the historic arena. Cheurlin produces two champagne categories: Cheurlin&#x27;s Brut Speciale and Rose de Saignee and Cheurlin Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Celebrite&quot; Blanc de Blanc and &quot;Le Champion&quot; Blanc de Noir. In August 2017, Thomas brought his Cheurlin Flagship Collection portfolio of Champagnes to the Bellagio in Las Vegas.

===Players Only===
Since 2017, Thomas has been a regular panelist during NBA on TNT&#x27;s Monday coverage &quot;Players Only&quot;, which features only former NBA players as studio analysts, play-by-play announcers, and color analysts for games.

===Acting===
Isiah had a guest appearance on the 1990s television comedy &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, playing himself in Season 3 episode 2 (titled &quot;Aisle See You in My Dreams&quot;). He further appeared as himself in a basketball themed episode of the police procedural &quot;Due South&quot; in 1997 (season 2, episode 13, titled &quot;White Men Can&#x27;t Jump to Conclusions&quot;).

==Education==
Thomas graduated from Indiana University with a B.A. in 1987. He received his Master&#x27;s in Education from the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Education in 2013. At UC Berkeley, Thomas studied the connection between education and sports, specifically how American society makes education accessible (or inaccessible) to black male college athletes.

==Philanthropic work==
In 1987, when he was a Piston, Thomas organized the &quot;No Crime Day&quot; in Detroit. He had the help of Detroit Mayor Coleman Young to call for a moratorium on crime in the summer of 1986.

Thomas founded Mary&#x27;s Court, a foundation that supports economically disadvantaged parents and children on the West Side of Chicago. The charity is named for Thomas&#x27;s mother. Mary&#x27;s Court has teamed up with another Chicago-based charity, Kids off the Block, to serve meals to Chicago children and families during Thanksgiving.

While Thomas was at FIU, Thomas and Mary&#x27;s Court donated $50,000 to FIU&#x27;s First Generation Scholarship and organized a sell-out charity game during the NBA lockout featuring NBA stars LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. A street on Chicago&#x27;s West Side was named in honor of his mother.

The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boys &amp; Girls Club of Chicago honored Thomas with the organization&#x27;s King Legacy Award at their 24th Annual King Legacy Awards Gala.

In July 2012, Thomas joined The Black Men&#x27;s Roundtable in Florida along with other national and local black leaders to discuss issues that directly affect black males.

The Peace League is an annual community basketball league within the Chicago area established by Thomas and Father Michael Pfleger in 2011. In September 2012, Thomas co-hosted the Ballin&#x27; for Peace Tournament at St. Sabina Church in Chicago to reduce gang violence through communication and basketball.

The Peace League initiative expanded into a program which offers GED classes, employment training, and internship opportunities. The surrounding Auburn-Gresham neighborhood has seen a drastic drop in violence since the league began. The Peace League Tournament was expanded to New York City during the 2015 NBA All-Star Weekend. The New York City Peace Game featured over 50 players from across all five boroughs that competed in a tournament as well as a brief speaking program with special guests that included Harry Belafonte.

In March 2013, Children Uniting Nations, an organization that focuses on advocacy/awareness and provides academic and community-based programs for at-risk and foster youth, presented Thomas and Mary&#x27;s Court with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his passion and commitment to improving the lives of children.

Each year, Mary&#x27;s Court provides gifts, clothing and educational items to hundreds of children in Chicago at its Holiday Toy Giveaway.

===Humanity of Connection Award===
On February 13, 2017, Thomas was presented the AT&amp;T Humanity of Connection Award at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. He was honored for his historic achievements in sports and his contributions to the African American community.

==Personal life==
Thomas met his future wife, Lynn Kendall, the daughter of a Secret Service agent and a nurse, in the early 1980s while they were both attending Indiana University. The couple married at Our Lady of Sorrows in 1985. Thomas and Kendall had a son, Joshua, in 1988, and a daughter, Lauren, in 1991.

===Paternity case===
Two months before Thomas&#x27;s marriage to Lynn Kendall in 1985, Jenni Dones, a woman from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, filed a paternity lawsuit against Thomas. Dones alleged that she had become pregnant following a three- or four-month &quot;intimate, exclusive, ongoing relationship&quot; with Thomas. Dones&#x27;s child, Marc E. T. Dones, was born in 1986. After a long-running legal dispute, Thomas agreed to pay a settlement as well as monthly payments. In 1995, Dones obtained additional financial support from Thomas in a separate lawsuit. Marc Dones has been described by the literary site thedetroiter.com as &quot;a talented writer and poet&quot;. He served as chief executive officer of the King County (WA) Regional Homelessness Authority.

==Legacy and accolades==
During his playing career, Thomas won an NCAA championship with Indiana in 1981 and NBA championships with Detroit in 1989 and 1990. He was selected as the Most Outstanding Player of the 1981 Final Four and the Most Valuable Player of the 1990 NBA Finals. He was a consensus first-team All-American in 1980 and a 12-time NBA All-Star.

When Thomas retired as a player in 1994, he ranked third in NBA history with 9,061 assists and fifth in league history with 1,861 steals. As of 2023, his 9,061 assists rank tenth in NBA history, and his average of 9.3 assists per game ranks fifth.

As of 2020, Thomas also remains the Pistons&#x27; all-time career leader in minutes played (15,904), points scored (18,822), steals (1,861), and assists (9,061).

In February 1996, the Pistons retired Thomas&#x27;s jersey No. 11.

In 1996, Thomas was named to the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, selected upon the 50th anniversary of the founding of the NBA. In 2021, he was elected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

Thomas has been inducted into the following halls of fame:

* In 1993, Thomas was inducted into the Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame.
* In 1998, he was inducted along with Magic Johnson into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame.
* In May 2000, he was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

<text>David Brown Santasalo, formerly David Brown Engineering, is a British engineering company, principally engaged in the manufacture of gears and gearboxes. Their major gear manufacturing plant is in Swan Lane, Lockwood, Huddersfield, adjacent to Lockwood railway station. It is named after the company&#x27;s founder, David Brown, though it is more closely associated with his grandson, Sir David Brown (1904–1993).

==History==
===David Brown===
Founded in 1860 as a pattern manufacturing company, by 1873 David Brown had begun to concentrate on gear systems and by 1898 was specialising in machine-cut gears. 

The company moved in 1902 to Park Works, Huddersfield, where the firm is based today.

===David Brown &amp; Sons, Huddersfield (the Huddersfield group)===
When David Brown died in 1901, his sons Percy and Frank took over and began the manufacture of gears, complete gear units, gear cutting machines, tools and equipment, bearings and shafts and worm drive gears. The foundry made steel and non-ferrous castings.

From 1908 to 1915, David Brown and Sons designed, developed and made the Valveless car under engineer Frederick Tasker Burgess (1879–1929), later chief engineer at Humber, and later still one of the team that developed the first 3-litre Bentley engine.

In 1913, they established a joint venture in America with Timken for Radicon worm drive units. By the end of World War I the workforce had increased from 200 to 1,000 as they started building propulsion units for warships, and drive mechanisms for armaments. By 1921 the company was the largest worm gear manufacturer in the world.

In 1930 the company took over P R Jackson another local firm of gear manufacturers and steel founders. Frank&#x27;s eldest son, Sir David Brown, became managing director in 1931 following Percy&#x27;s death in June that year. W S Roe was appointed joint managing director with David but he died in April 1933. Percy was appointed chairman. The business formed another overseas joint venture with Richardson Gears of Footscray, Victoria, Australia, in 1934. In 1934 the company moved into an old Silk Mill on a site at Meltham, on the south side of Huddersfield. Brown started building tractors with Harry Ferguson there in 1936. 

The company obtained a patent for a tank transmission using controlled differential steering system, known as the Merritt-Brown system, devised by Henry Merritt, Director of Tank Design at Woolwich Arsenal, in 1935. The first vehicle to use this system was the Churchill tank, and it was subsequently used on the Centurion tank and the Conqueror tank, as well as the Tortoise heavy tank.

In 1951 the Huddersfield and Tractor groups freehold land and buildings at Huddersfield, Penistone and Meltham were on sites covering about 150 acres (61 ha). Another 260,000 sq ft of floor space were held under lease.

Gearing manufactured by David Brown and powered by electric motors manufactured by Brook Crompton, whose factory was in Brockholes, are used to rotate the top of the BT Tower in London.

===David Brown Tractors Group===

Personally controlled since its inception by David Brown (1904–1993) the first venture into tractor production was in a joint project with Harry Ferguson in 1936 building the Ferguson-Brown tractor. David Brown became one of the biggest British tractor manufactures in the post war period, with a major manufacturing plant at Meltham, West Yorkshire England.The Ferguson-Brown had many innovative features, including the use of cast alloy for many the components, which was light but prone to damage. The Ferguson-Brown used a Coventry Climax engine for the first 350 tractors. Browns developed their own engine which was fitted to subsequent production. Total production was 1350 + 1 built from parts in 1940 after production finished.
Brown and Ferguson disagreed over tractor design details in the late 30s, which led David Brown to design his own version, the &quot;VAK1&quot;, in secret. This was launched at the 1939 Royal Show. Ferguson split away from Brown and joined up with Henry Ford in 1938, after a &#x27;handshake&#x27; agreement, to allow his Ferguson System three-point linkage to be used on the Fordson N tractors. That agreement was eventually terminated by Ford&#x27;s grandson in 1947 and Ferguson again split away to form Ferguson Tractors in 1948.

During World War II Brown&#x27;s new heavier tractor, the VAK1, was produced, with over 7,700 units eventually sold, making Brown a wealthy man. It is said the David Brown Tractor is the only one to be built onto a sturdy cast iron chassis where other makers bolt components together to form a chassis-less construction which is weaker. Brown also built aircraft tugs (VIG) for the Royal Air Force and for pulling the bomb trolleys used to re-arm aircraft. These tugs are distinctive, with truck like tyres, wrap round body work and HD bumpers front and rear, some being fitted with winches. In 1942 Brown started building a tracklayer version, the DB4. The DB4 was built for the army engineers and solved some of the problems found with the VTK, and got round an embargo on imported machines for military use. It was powered by a 38 h.p. Dorman diesel and a five-speed gearbox. The DB4 was replaced in 1950 by the Trackmaster 30.
The tractors division took over the Lancashire firm of Harrison, McGregor &amp; Guest, who produced the Albion brand of agricultural machinery to complement the tractor product line. After the takeover the company&#x27;s badge was modified to incorporate the white rose of Yorkshire and the red rose of Lancashire. The Tractors division had ten subsidiaries around the world. At one stage 80% of production was exported. Sales were handled by 2,508 agents in 100 countries. A worldwide recession saw tractor sales slump, and after braving the storm and with the debt of a brand new building and production line to finance, it was inevitable that the company was put up for sale, bought by Tenneco who also owned the US tractor firm &quot;J.I. Case Company&quot;. All hope to see the factory prosper was dashed when it was announced that survival was a competition between Huddersfield and the &quot;International Harvester&quot; tractor plant in Doncaster, with the odds stacked in the latter&#x27;s favour, especially with access to the motorway network on the doorstep. The Meltham factory ended production and a respected British name was erased.

====Tractor Group&#x27;s Lagonda and Aston Martin====
In 1947, Brown saw a classified advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot;, offering for sale a &quot;High Class Motor Business&quot;. Brown acquired Aston Martin for £20,500 and, in the following year, Lagonda for £52,500, followed by the coachbuilder Tickford in 1955. He subsequently concentrated all the Aston Martin manufacturing at the Tickford premises in Newport Pagnell. The David Brown years saw production of the legendary DB series of Aston Martins, which were featured in some James Bond films. 

David Brown also had connections with Vosper shipbuilding, and Delapina and Radyne machinery.

Both car companies were sold in 1972 to Company Developments, when Aston Martin was in financial trouble, for a nominal £100.

===Sale of David Brown Tractors to Case 1972===
In 1972 the tractor operations were sold to Tenneco of America, who owned the JI Case tractor company. The sale was due to a combination of a reduction in the UK tractor market, increased product development costs, the need to meet new regulations on health and safety, and increased competition from imported machinery. Case applied the David Brown name and branding to some of its own tractor models in the UK market until the early 1980s before abandoning it in favour of the Case IH brand.

===Sale by David Brown family – management buyout 1990===
In 1990 the David Brown family disposed of its stake to the business&#x27;s management. It then floated David Brown as a public company in 1993. David Brown was acquired by Textron in October 1998. 

This business, trading as David Brown Engineering Ltd and headquartered in Huddersfield, remains a supplier of heavy transmission systems for industrial, defense, railway and marine applications. These include transmissions for the British Challenger 2 tanks and American Bradley Fighting Vehicles. Railway transmissions are produced for their Chinese branch &#x27;David Brown China&#x27;, in a joint partnership called &#x27;Jiangsu Shinri David Brown Gear Systems&#x27; at a factory in Changzhou near Shanghai.

===Sale by Textron 2008===
In September 2008 it was announced that David Brown Gear systems and associated companies, David Brown Hydraulics based in Poole in Dorset, Maag Pumps of Switzerland, and Union Pumps of the USA were to be sold to Clyde Blowers of Scotland — owned by entrepreneur Jim McColl — in a £368 million deal.

in 2016 David Brown was merged with Santasalo to form David Brown Santasalo. The joint company now remains in the hands of N4 Partners.

<text>Eric William Kierans (2 February 1914 – 10 May 2004) was a Canadian economist and politician.

==Early life==
Eric Kierans was born on 2 February 1914, in Montreal to Irish immigrant parents. He grew up in a working-class neighborhood and attended Loyola College, where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commerce. 

After graduation, Kierans worked for several years in the family fur and leather business before leaving to pursue a career in politics. He joined the Liberal Party of Canada and was elected to the House of Commons in 1962, representing the riding of Saint-Laurent.

During his early life, Kierans was a passionate supporter of the cooperative movement and believed in the power of community organizing. He was also committed to social justice issues and worked to improve the lives of working-class Canadians.

He died on 10 May 2004, at the age of 90.

==Career==

After serving as director of the school of commerce at McGill University and president of the Montreal Stock Exchange, Kierans entered provincial politics in 1963. Nicknamed the &quot;Socialist Millionaire,&quot; he was appointed Minister of Revenue and then Minister of Health in the Quebec Liberal government of Quebec Premier Jean Lesage during the Quiet Revolution.

Kierans became president of the Quebec Liberal Party and clashed with former cabinet minister and colleague René Lévesque in 1967, daring him to give up the idea of Quebec separatism or quit the Liberal Party. Lévesque later quit the Liberal Party and established the &quot;Mouvement Souveraineté-Association&quot;, which became Quebec&#x27;s leading sovereigntist party as the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot;.

Initially a critic of Walter L. Gordon&#x27;s economic nationalism, Kierans&#x27; experience in government changed his mind, and he became a believer in the need for state intervention in the economy.

In 1968, Kierans entered federal politics running unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada at its 1968 leadership convention. He was elected to the House of Commons in the 1968 federal election. Kierans served as Postmaster-General and Minister of Communications in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He did not run for re-election in the 1972 election, partly as a result of his criticisms of Trudeau&#x27;s economic policy.

Kierans called for Canada to leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1969. He argued that the organization might have served a useful purpose on its initial formation but had since become anachronistic. Some others with the Trudeau government agreed with Kierans, but others strongly disagreed. The Trudeau government ultimately kept Canada in NATO but reduced Canada&#x27;s troop deployment.

He considered running for the leadership of the New Democratic Party in 1975 but declined in favour of Ed Broadbent.

After leaving politics, Kierans taught at McGill and Dalhousie University. In the 1980s, he became a familiar voice appearing with Dalton Camp and Stephen Lewis as part of a weekly political panel on Peter Gzowski&#x27;s Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio show, &quot;Morningside&quot;.

In 1994, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

<doc id="542948" wikidata="Q74566546" url="?curid=542948" title="Glucose 6-phosphate">
<text>Glucose 6-phosphate (G6P, sometimes called the Robison ester) is a glucose sugar phosphorylated at the hydroxy group on carbon 6. This dianion is very common in cells as the majority of glucose entering a cell will become phosphorylated in this way.

Because of its prominent position in cellular chemistry, glucose 6-phosphate has many possible fates within the cell. It lies at the start of two major metabolic pathways: glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway.

In addition to these two metabolic pathways, glucose 6-phosphate may also be converted to glycogen or starch for storage. This storage is in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen for most multicellular animals, and in intracellular starch or glycogen granules for most other organisms.

==Production==
===From glucose===
Within a cell, glucose 6-phosphate is produced by phosphorylation of glucose on the sixth carbon. This is catalyzed by the enzyme hexokinase in most cells, and, in higher animals, glucokinase in certain cells, most notably liver cells. One equivalent of ATP is consumed in this reaction.
 

The major reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent diffusion out of the cell. The phosphorylation adds a charged phosphate group so the glucose 6-phosphate cannot easily cross the cell membrane.

===From glycogen===
Glucose 6-phosphate is also produced during glycogenolysis from glucose 1-phosphate, the first product of the breakdown of glycogen polymers.

== Pentose phosphate pathway ==

When the ratio of NADP+ to NADPH increases, the body needs to produce more NADPH (a reducing agent for several reactions like fatty acid synthesis and glutathione reduction in erythrocytes). This will cause the G6P to be dehydrogenated to 6-phosphogluconate by glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This irreversible reaction is the initial step of the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates the useful cofactor NADPH as well as ribulose-5-phosphate, a carbon source for the synthesis of other molecules. Also, if the body needs nucleotide precursors of DNA for growth and synthesis, G6P will also be dehydrogenated and enter the pentose phosphate pathway.

== Glycolysis ==
If the cell needs energy or carbon skeletons for synthesis, then glucose 6-phosphate is targeted for glycolysis. Glucose 6-phosphate is first isomerized to fructose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucose isomerase, which uses magnesium as a cofactor.
 

This reaction converts glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate in preparation for phosphorylation to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The addition of the second phosphoryl group to produce fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is an irreversible step, and so is used to irreversibly target the glucose 6-phosphate breakdown to provide energy for ATP production via glycolysis.

== Storage as glycogen ==

If blood glucose levels are high, the body needs a way to store the excess glucose. After being converted to G6P, the molecule can be turned into glucose 1-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. Glucose 1-phosphate can then be combined with uridine triphosphate (UTP) to form UDP-glucose, driven by the hydrolysis of UTP, releasing phosphate. Now, the activated UDP-glucose can add to a growing glycogen molecule with the help of glycogen synthase. This is a very efficient storage mechanism for glucose since it costs the body only 1 ATP to store the 1 glucose molecule and virtually no energy to remove it from storage. It is important to note that glucose 6-phosphate is an allosteric activator of glycogen synthase, which makes sense because when the level of glucose is high the body should store the excess glucose as glycogen. On the other hand, glycogen synthase is inhibited when it is phosphorylated by protein kinase during times of high stress or low levels of blood glucose, via hormone induction by glucagon or adrenaline.

When the body needs glucose for energy, glycogen phosphorylase, with the help of an orthophosphate, can cleave away a molecule from the glycogen chain. The cleaved molecule is in the form of glucose 1-phosphate, which can be converted into G6P by phosphoglucomutase. Next, the phosphoryl group on G6P can be cleaved by glucose 6-phosphatase so that a free glucose can be formed. This free glucose can pass through membranes and can enter the bloodstream to travel to other places in the body.

== Dephosphorylation and release into bloodstream ==

Liver cells express the transmembrane enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase in the endoplasmic reticulum. The catalytic site is found on the lumenal face of the membrane, and removes the phosphate group from glucose 6-phosphate produced during glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis. Free glucose is transported out of the endoplasmic reticulum via GLUT7 and released into the bloodstream via GLUT2 for uptake by other cells. Muscle cells lack this enzyme, so myofibers use glucose 6-phosphate in their own metabolic pathways such as glycolysis. Importantly, this prevents myocytes from releasing glycogen stores they have obtained into the blood.

<doc id="542949" wikidata="Q17154054" url="?curid=542949" title="Information ecology">
<text>Information ecology is the application of ecological concepts for modeling the information society. It considers the dynamics and properties of the increasingly dense, complex and important digital informational environment. &quot;Information ecology&quot; often is used as metaphor, viewing the information space as an ecosystem, the information ecosystem.

Information ecology also makes a connection to the concept of collective intelligence and knowledge ecology . Eddy et al. (2014) use information ecology for science-policy integration in ecosystems-based management (EBM).

== Networked information economy ==
In &quot;The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom&quot;, a book published in 2006 and available under a Creative Commons license on its own wikispace, Yochai Benkler provides an analytic framework for the emergence of the networked information economy that draws deeply on the language and perspectives of information ecology together with observations and analyses of high-visibility examples of successful peer production processes, citing Wikipedia as a prime example.

Bonnie Nardi and Vicki O&#x27;Day in their book &quot;Information Ecologies: Using Technology with Heart,&quot; apply the ecology metaphor to local environments, such as libraries and schools, in preference to the more common metaphors for technology as tool, text, or system.

== In different domains / disciplines ==

=== Anthropology ===
Nardi and O’Day&#x27;s book represents the first specific treatment of information ecology by anthropologists. H.E. Kuchka situates information within socially-distributed cognition of cultural systems. Casagrande and Peters use information ecology for an anthropological critique of Southwest US water policy. Stepp (1999) published a prospectus for the anthropological study of information ecology.

=== Knowledge management ===
Information ecology was used as book title by Thomas H. Davenport and Laurence Prusak , with a focus on the organization dimensions of information ecology. There was also an academic research project at DSTC called &quot;Information ecology&quot;, concerned with distributed information systems and online communities.

=== Law ===
Law schools represent another area where the phrase is gaining increasing acceptance, e.g.
NYU Law School Conference Towards a Free Information Ecology and a lecture series on Information ecology at Duke University Law School&#x27;s Center for the Study of the Public Domain.

=== Library science ===
The field of library science has seen significant adoption of the term and librarians have been described by Nardi and O&#x27;Day as a &quot;keystone species in information ecology&quot;, and references to information ecology range as far afield as the Collaborative Digital Reference Service of the Library of Congress, to children&#x27;s library database administrator in Russia.

=== Science-Policy Integration (SPI) / Ecosystems-Based Management (EBM) ===
Eddy et al. (2014) use principles of information ecology to develop a framework for integrating scientific information in decision-making in ecosystem-based management (EBM). Using a metaphor of how a species adapts to environmental changes through information processing, they developed a 3-tiered model that differentiates primary, secondary and tertiary levels of information processing, within both the technical and human domains.

<text>The Secret of the Unicorn () is the eleventh volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was serialised daily in , Belgium&#x27;s leading francophone newspaper, from June 1942 to January 1943 amidst the Nazi German occupation of Belgium during World War II. The story revolves around young reporter Tintin, his dog Snowy, and his friend Captain Haddock, who discover a riddle left by Haddock&#x27;s ancestor, the 17th century Sir Francis Haddock, which can lead them to the hidden treasure of the pirate Red Rackham. To unravel the riddle, Tintin and Haddock must obtain three identical models of Sir Francis&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Unicorn&quot;, but they discover that criminals are also after three model ships and are willing to kill in order to obtain them.

&quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé concluded the arc begun in this story with &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; remained Hergé&#x27;s favourite of his own works until creating &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; (1960). The story was adapted for the 1957 Belvision animated series &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1992-3 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;, the feature film &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011) directed by Steven Spielberg, and the film&#x27;s tie-in video game.

==Synopsis==
While browsing on the Brussels Voddenmarkt/&quot;Marché aux puces&quot; at the Vossenplein in the Marollen, Tintin purchases an antique model ship which he intends to give to his friend, Captain Haddock. Two strangers, model ship collector Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine and antique-scout Barnaby, independently try and fail to persuade Tintin to sell the model to them. Tintin also meets detectives Thomson and Thompson on a secret mission looking out for a pickpocket; however, both their wallets are repeatedly stolen throughout the story. At Tintin&#x27;s flat, Snowy accidentally knocks the model over and breaks its mainmast. Having shown the ship to Haddock, Tintin discovers that the ship is named the &quot;Unicorn&quot;, after a ship commanded by Haddock&#x27;s own ancestor.

While Tintin is out, the ship is stolen from his apartment; in the following investigation, he discovers that Sakharine owns an identical model, also named the &quot;Unicorn&quot;. At home, Tintin discovers a miniature scroll, and realises that it must have been hidden inside the mast of the model. Written on the parchment is a riddle: &quot;Three brothers joined. Three &quot;Unicorns&quot; in company sailing in the noonday sunne will speak. For &#x27;tis from the light that light will dawn, and then shines forth the Eagle&#x27;s cross&quot;. Captain Haddock vividly recounts the tale of the &quot;Unicorn&quot;, a 17th-century warship captained by his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, but seized by a pirate band led by Red Rackham. In a retold flashback, it is shown how Francis&#x27; ship is attacked by Red Rackham and his crew. At first the pirates raise the black Jolly Roger, indicating that quarter (safe conduct) is offered in exchange for peaceful surrender, but when Francis refuses to strike his flag and bombards the pirates with cannon fire, the pirates instead &quot;hoists fresh colors&quot; and raise the &quot;red pennant&quot; (a bloody flag, ), signaling no quarter (no mercy, no prisoners), after which they board Francis&#x27; ship and massacre his crew. The only one of his crew to survive the boarding, Sir Francis killed Red Rackham in single combat and scuttled the &quot;Unicorn&quot;; he later built three models, which he left to his sons.

Tintin deduces that each of the models contains a scroll, which united lead to the location of Red Rackham&#x27;s treasure. Tintin and Haddock try to get the three scrolls but they are out of luck: Tintin&#x27;s wallet (with the first scroll) is stolen, while Sakharine is found drugged, and the scroll inside his own Unicorn missing. Meanwhile, Barnaby requests a meeting with Tintin, but is gunned down on Tintin&#x27;s doorstep before he can speak, and points to sparrows as a cryptic clue to the identity of his assailant before falling unconscious. A few days later, Tintin is kidnapped and chloroformed by the perpetrators of the shooting: the Bird brothers, two unscrupulous antique dealers who own the third model of the &quot;Unicorn&quot;. They are behind the theft of Tintin&#x27;s model and have also stolen Sakharine&#x27;s parchment, knowing that only by possessing all three parchments can the location of Red Rackham&#x27;s treasure be found.

Tintin escapes from the cellars of the Bird brothers&#x27; country estate, Marlinspike Hall, while the Captain arrives with Thomson and Thompson to arrest them. It is revealed that the Bird Brothers have only one of the parchments, as two were lost when their wallet was stolen. It is also revealed that Barnaby survived and has made a full recovery, much to Max Bird&#x27;s enragement. The Bird brothers are arrested. Tintin and Thomson and Thompson track down the pickpocket, Aristides Silk, a kleptomaniac who has a penchant for collecting wallets, and obtain the Bird Brothers&#x27; wallet, containing the missing two parchments. By combining the three parchments and holding them to light, Tintin and Haddock discover the coordinates (20°37&#x27;42.0&quot; N 70°52&#x27;15.0&quot; W, 82 km north of the Dominican Republic) of the lost treasure and plan an expedition to find it.

==History==
===Background===
&quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; was serialized amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. Hergé had accepted a position working for , Belgium&#x27;s largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, the German authorities permitted to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor Raymond de Becker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining on 15 October 1940, Hergé became editor of its new children&#x27;s supplement , with assistance by old friend Paul Jamin and cartoonist Jacques Van Melkebeke, before paper shortages forced &quot;Tintin&quot; to be serialised daily in the main pages of . Some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration, although he was heavily enticed by the size of &quot;&quot;&#x27;s readership, which reached 600,000. Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight, Hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work, instead adopting a policy of neutrality. Without the need to satirise political types, entertainment producer and author Harry Thompson observed that &quot;Hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy. The public reacted positively&quot;.

&quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; was the first of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; which Hergé had collaborated on with Van Melkebeke to a significant degree; biographer Benoît Peeters suggested that Van Melkebeke should rightly be considered the story&#x27;s &quot;co-scriptwriter&quot;. It was Hergé&#x27;s discussions with Van Melkebeke that led him to craft a more complex story than he had in prior &quot;Adventures&quot;. Van Melkebeke had been strongly influenced by the adventure novels of writers like Jules Verne and Paul d&#x27;Ivoi, and this influence is apparent throughout the story. The inclusion of three hidden scrolls has parallels with Verne&#x27;s 1867 story, &quot;The Children of Captain Grant&quot;, which Van Melkebeke had recommended to Hergé. Hergé acknowledged Van Melkebeke&#x27;s contribution by including a cameo of him within the market scene at the start of the story; this was particularly apt as Van Melkebeke had purchased his books in Brussels&#x27; Old Market as a child.

&quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; was the first half of a two-part story arc that was concluded in the following adventure, &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;. This arc was the first that Hergé had utilised since &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; (1934–36). However, as Tintin expert Michael Farr related, whereas &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; had been largely &quot;self-sufficient and self-contained&quot;, the connection between &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; is far closer.

In previous works, Hergé had drawn upon a variety of pictorial sources, such as newspaper clippings, from which to draw the scenes and characters; for &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources. In drawing many of the old vessels, Hergé initially consulted the then recently published &quot;L&#x27;Art et la Mer&quot; (&quot;Art and the Sea&quot;) by Alexandre Berqueman. Seeking further accurate depictions of old naval vessels, Hergé consulted his friend Gérard Liger-Belair, who owned a Brussels shop specialising in model ships. Liger-Belair produced plans of a 17th-century French fifty-gun warship for Hergé to copy; &quot;Le Brillant&quot;, which had been constructed in Le Havre in 1690 by the shipwright Salicon and then decorated by Jean Bérain the Elder.

He also studied other vessels from the period, such as the &quot;Le Soleil Royal&quot;, &quot;La Couronne&quot;, &quot;La Royale&quot; and &quot;Le Reale de France&quot;, to better understand 17th-century ship design. It was from the &quot;Le Reale de France&quot; that he gained a basis for his design of the &quot;Unicorn&quot; jolly boat. No ship named the &quot;Unicorn&quot; was listed in the annals of the French Navy, but Hergé instead took the name from a British frigate which had been active in the mid-18th century; the fictional ship&#x27;s unicorn figurehead was also adopted from the frigate.

The character of Red Rackham was partly inspired by Jean Rackam, a fictional pirate who appeared in a story alongside female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read that Hergé encountered in a November 1938 edition of &quot;&quot;. Red Rackham&#x27;s looks and costumes were also inspired by the character Lerouge, who appears in C. S. Forester&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Captain from Connecticut&quot;, and by the 17th-century French buccaneer Daniel Montbars. The name of Marlinspike Hall— in French—was based upon the name of the real Belgian town, Sart-Moulin. The actual design of the building was based upon the Château de Cheverny, albeit with the two outer wings removed. In introducing Sir Francis Haddock to the story, Hergé made Captain Haddock the only character in the series (except Jolyon Wagg, introduced later) to have a family and an ancestry. The story included hints that Francis Haddock is the illegitimate son of the French Sun King, Louis XIV, possibly as a reference to Hergé&#x27;s belief that his father was the illegitimate son of the Belgian king Leopold II. &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; was set entirely in Belgium and was the last &quot;Adventure&quot; to be set there until &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;. It would also be Hergé&#x27;s favourite story until &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;. The final two pages of the adventure mark the first appearance of Tintin&#x27;s iconic costume of a white shirt under a blue sweater; having worn a variety of outfits in previous volumes, notably a brown suit and a yellow shirt with a red tie, he would don this attire in all subsequent books. In the final panel, Tintin breaks the fourth wall. It is the only instance of this effect in the entire series.

===Historical parallels===

After publishing the book, Hergé learned that there had actually been an Admiral Haddock who had served in the British Royal Navy during the late 17th and early 18th centuries: Sir Richard Haddock (1629–1715). Richard Haddock was in charge of the &quot;Royal James&quot;, the flagship of the Earl of Sandwich during the Battle of Solebay of 1672, the first naval battle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. During the fighting, the &quot;Royal James&quot; was set alight and Haddock escaped but had to be rescued from the sea, following which his bravery was recognised by the British monarch, King Charles II. He subsequently took command of another ship, the &quot;Royal Charles&quot;, before becoming a naval administrator in later life. Admiral Haddock&#x27;s grandfather, also named Richard, commanded the ship of the line during the reign of King Charles I.

Another individual known as Captain Haddock had lived in this period, who had commanded a fire ship, the &quot;Anne and Christopher&quot;. It was recorded by David Ogg that this captain and his ship had been separated from their squadron whilst out at sea and so docked at Málaga to purchase goods that could be taken back to Britain and sold for a profit. For this action, Haddock was brought before an admiralty tribunal in 1674, where he was ordered to forfeit all profits from the transaction and suspended from his command for six months.

===Publication===

&quot;Le Secret de La Licorne&quot; began serialisation as a daily strip in newspaper &quot;Le Soir&quot; from 11 June 1942. As with previous adventures, it then began serialisation in the French Catholic newspaper &quot;Cœurs Vaillants&quot;, from 19 March 1944. In Belgium, it was then published in a 62-page book format by Editions Casterman in 1943. Now fully coloured, the book included a new cover design created by Hergé after he had completed the original serialisation of the story, along with six large colour drawings. The first printing sold 30,000 copies in Francophone Belgium.

&quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; were the first two &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be published in standalone English-language translations for the British market, as &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; had previously been serialised in &quot;Eagle&quot; in 1951. Published by Casterman in 1952, these two editions sold poorly and have since become rare collector&#x27;s items. Both stories would be republished for the British market seven years later, this time by Methuen with new translations provided by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper. In the English translation, the letters sent to Marlinspike reveal that the estate is in England rather than Belgium. Thomson and Thompson find their stolen wallets in the thief&#x27;s alphabetical files before the E section, reflecting their original names Dupont and Dupond. Sir Francis Haddock is described as having served the English monarch Charles II, in contrast to the original French version, in which he serves French king Louis XIV, and the &quot;Unicorn&#x27;s&quot; flag is changed accordingly.

The series&#x27; Danish publishers, Carlsen, later located a model of an early-17th-century Danish ship called &quot;Enhjørningen&quot; (&quot;The Unicorn&quot;) which they gave to Hergé. Constructed in 1605, &quot;Enhjørningen&quot; had been wrecked in explorer Jens Munk&#x27;s 1619–20 attempt to navigate the Northwest Passage.

==Critical analysis==
&quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; resembled the earlier &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; in its use of style, colour and content, leading Harry Thompson to remark that it &quot;unquestionably&quot; belongs to the 1930s, considering it to be &quot;the last and best of Hergé&#x27;s detective mysteries&quot;. He asserted that this story and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; marked the third and central stage of &quot;Tintin&#x27;s career&quot;, also stating that here, Tintin has been converted from a reporter into an explorer to cope with the new political climate. He further added his opinion that it was &quot;the most successful of all Tintin&#x27;s adventures&quot;. 
Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier asserted that Sir Francis Haddock was &quot;the best realised character&quot; in the story, conversely describing the Bird Brothers as &quot;relatively uninspired villains&quot;. They went on to state that &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;-&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; arc represents &quot;a turning point&quot; for the series as it shifts the reader&#x27;s attention from Tintin to Haddock, who has become &quot;by far, the most interesting character&quot;. They praised the &quot;truly outstanding storytelling&quot; of &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, ultimately awarding it a rating of four out of five.

Phillipe Goddin commented on the scene in the story in which Haddock relates the life of his ancestor, stating that the reader is &quot;alternately projected into the present and the past with staggering mastery. Periods interlocked, enriched one another, were amplified and married in a stunning fluidity. Hergé was at the height of his powers&quot;.

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters asserted that both &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; &quot;hold a crucial position&quot; in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; as they establish the &quot;Tintin universe&quot; with its core set of characters. Focusing on the former comic, he described it as one of Hergé&#x27;s &quot;greatest narrative successes&quot; through the manner in which it interweaves three separate plots. He felt that while religious elements had been present in previous stories, they were even stronger in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and its sequel, something which he attributed to Van Melkebeke&#x27;s influence. Elsewhere he asserted that it &quot;explores this prelude with extraordinary narrative virtuosity&quot;.

Biographer Pierre Assouline stated that the story was &quot;clearly influenced... in spirit if not in detail&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s book, &quot;Treasure Island&quot; in that it &quot;seemed to cater to a need for escapism&quot;. He described the adventure as &quot;a new development in Hergé&#x27;s work, a flight from the topical to epics of pirate adventures set in distant horizons&quot;. Assouline also expressed the view that the ancestral figure of Sir Francis Haddock reflected Hergé&#x27;s attempt to incorporate one of his own family secrets, that he had an aristocratic ancestor, into the story.

Michael Farr believed that the &quot;most remarkable&quot; factor of the book was its introduction of Sir Francis Haddock, highlighting that in his mannerisms and visual depiction, he is &quot;scarcely distinguishable&quot; from Captain Haddock. He also highlighted that the scenes in which Captain Haddock relates the tale of his ancestor carries on the &quot;merging of dreams and reality&quot; that Hergé had &quot;experimented with&quot; in &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot; and &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;. Noting that unlike &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, this two-book story arc contains &quot;scarcely an allusion to occupation and war&quot;, he praised the arc&#x27;s narrative as &quot;perfectly paced, without that feeling of haste&quot; present in some of Hergé&#x27;s earlier work.

In his psychoanalytical study of the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the academic Jean-Marie Apostolidès characterised the &quot;Secret of the Unicorn&quot;-&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; arc as being about the characters going on a &quot;treasure hunt that turns out to be at the same time a search for their roots&quot;. He stated that the arc delves into Haddock&#x27;s ancestry, and in doing so &quot;deals with the meanings of symbolic relations within personal life&quot;. Discussing the character of Sir Francis Haddock, he states that this ancestral figure resembles both Tintin and Haddock, &quot;the foundling and the bastard&quot;, thus making the duo brothers as well as close friends. He adds that when Captain Haddock reenacts his ancestor&#x27;s fight with Rackham, he adopts his &quot;very soul, his &quot;mana&quot;, and is transformed in the process&quot;. Apostolidès also discusses Red Rackham, noting that the name &quot;Red&quot; conjures up &quot;the forbidden colour of blood and wine&quot; while &quot;Rackham&quot; combines &quot;raca&quot; (&quot;false brother&quot;) with the French word for scum (&quot;racaille&quot;), then highlighting a potential link between Rackham&#x27;s name and that of Rascar Capac, an Incan mummy who appears in &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;. He further draws parallels between the model ships containing the secret parchments with the Arumbaya fetish containing a rare diamond which appears in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy highlighted the scene in which Tintin was imprisoned in the Marlinspike crypt, observing that it had parallels with Tintin&#x27;s exploration of tombs and other secret chambers throughout the series. He identified the mystery left in Francis Haddock&#x27;s parchments to be another appearance of Tintin&#x27;s adventures being &quot;framed by enigmas&quot;. To this he adds that in solving the enigma, Tintin shows that he is &quot;the best reader&quot; in the series, and it is this which establishes him as &quot;the oeuvre&#x27;s hero&quot;. McCarthy praised Hergé&#x27;s Silk as one of the pivotal characters in the series who can &quot;exude a presence far beyond that which we might expect from a novelist, let alone a cartoonist&quot;.

Pierre Fresnault-Deruelle discussed the scene in the story in which Tintin was imprisoned in the crypt of Marlinspike Hall. He stated that in this section &quot;Hergé offers us an embedded story, a kind of interlude in which the artist, setting aside the use value of objects, takes the liberty of giving them mischievous powers, akin to a certain surrealism&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In 1957, the animation company Belvision Studios produced &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, a series of daily five-minute colour adaptations based upon Hergé&#x27;s original comics. &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; was the fourth to be adapted in the second animated series; it was directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, a well-known cartoonist who was to become editor-in-chief of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine.

In 1991, a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes. &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; was the ninth story of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be produced and was divided into two thirty-minute episodes. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot; to the original comics, to the extent that the animation was directly adopted from Hergé&#x27;s original panels.

A 2011 motion capture feature film directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson was released in most of the world October–November 2011, under the title &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, and in the US on 21 December, where it was simply titled &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The film is partially based on &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, combined with elements of &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; and &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;. A video-game tie-in to the movie was released October 2011.

<text>Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure () is the twelfth volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. The story was serialised daily in , Belgium&#x27;s leading francophone newspaper, from February to September 1943 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. Completing an arc begun in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, the story tells of young reporter Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock as they launch an expedition to the Caribbean to locate the treasure of the pirate Red Rackham.

&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman the year following its conclusion. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; has been cited as one of the most important installments in the series for marking the first appearance of eccentric scientist Cuthbert Calculus, who subsequently became a core character. The story was adapted for the 1957 Belvision animated series &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the 1992-3 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;, the feature film &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011) directed by Steven Spielberg, and the film&#x27;s tie-in video game.

==Synopsis==

:&quot;The synopsis continues a plot begun in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;.&quot;

Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock plan an expedition to the West Indies aboard a fishing trawler, the &quot;Sirius&quot;, to search for the treasure of the pirate Red Rackham. Having previously read three parchments authored by Haddock&#x27;s ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock, the duo had discovered the coordinates to what they believe is the treasure aboard the sunken 17th century vessel, the &quot;Unicorn&quot;, near an unknown island. An eccentric, hard-of-hearing inventor named Professor Cuthbert Calculus offers to aid them with the use of his shark-shaped one-man submarine, but they decline his assistance. Setting sail, they are joined by the police detectives Thomson and Thompson and soon discover that Calculus has stowed away on board, bringing his submarine with him.

When they reach the coordinates shown on the parchments, there is no island in sight. Frustrated, Haddock ponders turning back, but Tintin soon realizes the problem: If Sir Francis had used a French chart instead of an English chart to calculate the position, the coordinates would have been measured on the Paris Meridian rather than the Greenwich Meridian. As they have been using the Greenwich Meridian, they realise that they are too far west.

After traveling to the correct position, they discover an uncharted island, which is located about north of Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) and East-South-East of Cockburn Town (location of 20°37&#x27;42.0&quot;N 70°52&#x27;15.0&quot;W, adjusted by 2° 20′ 14.02500″ E for the Paris Meridian). There, they find a statue of Sir Francis Haddock and other evidence, including parrots who still use Haddock insults handed down from Sir Francis. Tintin deduces that Francis Haddock had taken refuge on the island and that the wreck of the &quot;Unicorn&quot; must be nearby. They locate the wreck using Calculus&#x27; submarine and recover various artefacts from it, but do not find the treasure. Among the artefacts is a strongbox containing old documents revealing that Sir Francis Haddock had been the owner of the country estate Marlinspike Hall.

Back in Belgium, Calculus purchases the Hall, using funds from the sale of his submarine design, and gives it to Haddock. Tintin and Haddock search the house&#x27;s cellars, where Tintin spots a statue of Saint John the Evangelist holding a cross with a globe and eagle at its feet. Tintin suddenly remembers that Francis Haddock&#x27;s original three parchments said, &quot;For &#x27;tis from the light that light will dawn, and then shines forth the Eagle&#x27;s cross&quot; and realises that this message referred, not to the location of the &quot;Unicorn&quot;, but to Saint John &quot;the eagle&quot;: his traditional symbol. Tintin locates the island on the globe, presses a secret button which he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham&#x27;s treasure hidden inside. Sometime later, Haddock hosts an exhibition of the treasure and several &quot;Unicorn&quot; artefacts in Marlinspike Hall.

==History==

===Background===
&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; was serialized amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. Hergé had accepted a position working for , Belgium&#x27;s largest Francophone daily newspaper. Confiscated from its original owners, was permitted by the German authorities to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor Raymond de Becker, although it remained firmly under Nazi control, supporting the German war effort and espousing anti-Semitism. After joining on 15 October 1940, Hergé became editor of its new children&#x27;s supplement, , with the help of an old friend, Paul Jamin, and the cartoonist Jacques Van Melkebeke, before paper shortages forced &quot;Tintin&quot; to be serialised daily in the main pages of . Some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration, although he was heavily enticed by the size of &quot;&quot;&#x27;s readership, which numbered some 600,000. Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight, Hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had pervaded much of his earlier work, instead adopting a policy of neutrality. Entertainment producer and author Harry Thompson observed that, without the need to satirise political types, &quot;Hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy. The public reacted positively&quot;.

&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; was the second half of a two-part story arc which had begun with the previous adventure, &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;. This arc was the first that Hergé had produced since &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; (1934–36). However, as Tintin expert Michael Farr related, whereas &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot; had been largely &quot;self-sufficient and self-contained&quot;, the connection between &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; is far closer.

===Influences===
&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; introduced Professor Cuthbert Calculus to &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, who became a recurring character. Hergé had made use of various eccentric professors in earlier volumes of the series, such as Sophocles Sarcophagus in &quot;Cigars of the Pharaoh&quot;, Hector Alembick in &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;, and Decimus Phostle in &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, all of whom prefigure the arrival of Calculus. The character&#x27;s deafness had been inspired by a colleague whom Hergé had worked with years earlier at &quot;Le Vingtième Siècle&quot;. Visually, Calculus was based on a real scientist, the Swiss inventor Auguste Piccard, who had been the first man to explore the stratosphere in a hot air balloon in 1931. Hergé had observed Piccard walking about Brussels on a number of occasions, however the character of Calculus would be notably much shorter than Piccard. Hergé named this character Tryphon Tournesol; while the surname meant &quot;sunflower&quot;, the forename was adopted from a carpenter named Tryphon Beckaert whom Hergé had encountered in Boitsfort. Tryphon Tournesol was later renamed Cuthbert Calculus in the English translation and Balduin Bienlein (meaning &quot;Little Bee&quot;) for the German translation.

Calculus&#x27; shark-shaped submarine was visually based on a real American submarine; Hergé had seen a picture of this in a German newspaper. The diving suit worn in the story was also based on clippings that Hergé had accumulated. Similarly, the dockside bar depicted by the cartoonist was based on an illustration that he had collected. The shop where Haddock and Tintin buy the diving equipment, including the suit, was inspired from a picture of a bar which was featured in the German magazine, &quot;Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung&quot;. The tribal effigy found on a Caribbean island by Sir Francis Haddock was based on a Bamileke tribal statue from Cameroon that Hergé saw in a museum. The &quot;Sirius&quot;, which had appeared before in &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, was named after the &quot;SS Sirius&quot;, the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean solely under steam power, but was visually based upon the design of a trawler, the &quot;John-O.88&quot;. Hergé had sketched this ship in Ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of the trawler from the builders, Jos Boel &amp; Son, and a small-scale model of it from a collector. The undersea wreck of the &quot;Unicorn&quot; was loosely inspired by images of the wreck of a 17th-century Swedish vessel, the &quot;Vasa&quot;, which Hergé had collected. The instance in the story in which a shark swallows a large box (that the characters hope contains the treasure) is based on a real account of a shark that swallowed a camera from the American underwater photographer Otis Barton, which Hergé had encountered in a French illustrated magazine.

The brief appearance of Dr. Daumière, who warns Haddock to cease drinking alcohol, was an allusion to Hergé&#x27;s own physician, Dr. Daumerie. Hergé made a comical reference to the French comedian Sacha Guitry in the story by advertising a play by Guitry titled &quot;Me&quot; in which Guitry himself plays every role.

===Publication===
&quot;Le Trésor De Rackham Le Rouge&quot; began serialisation as a daily strip in &quot;Le Soir&quot; from 19 February 1943. The title of the new adventure had been announced in an advertisement in the newspaper two days previously. In Belgium, it was then published in a 62-page book format by Editions Casterman in 1944. &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; contained one of Hergé&#x27;s two favourite illustrations from &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. It combines three actions encapsulating a sequence of events into one drawing: Haddock striding up the beach in the foreground, Tintin, Thomson and Thompson bringing the rowboat ashore in the midground, and the &quot;Sirius&quot; weighing anchor in the background.

Rather than immediately embark on the creation of a new Tintin adventure, Hergé agreed to a proposal that &quot;Le Soir&quot; crime writer, Paul Kinnet, would author a detective story featuring Thomson and Thompson. The story was titled &quot;Dupont et Dupond, détectives&quot; (&quot;Thomson and Thompson, Detectives&quot;), and was illustrated by Hergé.

&quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; were the first two &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be published in standalone English-language translations for the British market, as &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot; had previously been serialised in &quot;Eagle&quot; in 1951. Published by Casterman in 1952, these two editions sold poorly and have since become rare collector&#x27;s items. They would be republished for the British market seven years later, this time by Methuen with translations provided by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper. Farr reported that &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; is the best-selling story in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, while Harry Thompson referred to &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;-&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; arc as &quot;the most successful of all Tintin&#x27;s adventures&quot;.

==Critical analysis==
Harry Thompson stated that the &quot;Secrets of the Unicorn&quot;-&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; arc marked the beginning of the third and central stage of &quot;Tintin&#x27;s career&quot;. He furthermore stated that in these two stories, Tintin has been converted from a reporter into an explorer to cope with the new political climate. He stated that in this story, Hergé &quot;abandons the complex plotting of &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; in favour of an episodic style of adventure not seen since the early books&quot;. Thompson further draws attention to the arrival of Calculus in the story, describing him as the &quot;third and final member&quot; of Tintin&#x27;s &quot;family&quot;. Thompson was critical of the use of colour in the story, stating that much of it looks better in black-and-white, as it was originally printed in &quot;Le Soir&quot;.

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters observed that both &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; &quot;hold a crucial position&quot; in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; as it establishes the &quot;Tintin universe&quot; with its core set of characters. He felt that while religious elements had been present in previous stories, they were even stronger in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and its sequel, something which he attributed to Van Melkebeke&#x27;s influence. Peeters believed that &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; was &quot;an unforgettable book&quot; because it is the volume in which the &quot;family&quot;—meaning Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Calculus—all come together. Fellow biographer Pierre Assouline echoed this idea, noting that Hergé had &quot;settled&quot; the three characters in their new home. Focusing on the character of Calculus, he noted that the idea of the eccentric professor was &quot;so universal that it would be inaccurate to point to any one source&quot;, suggesting possible influences from Charlie Chaplin and Hergé&#x27;s own father. For Assouline, the professor embodies &quot;the gentle madness and subtle humour in comic strips&quot;. He added that both &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; and its predecessor &quot;reveal Hergé at a new level in his art&quot;, and suggested that the reason for their popularity lay in the fact that they were &quot;the visual continuation of a literary universe that stretches from Jules Verne to Pierre Benoit&quot;.

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier opined that &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;-&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; arc represents &quot;a turning point&quot; for the series as it shifts the reader&#x27;s attention from Tintin to Haddock, who has become &quot;by far, the most interesting character&quot;. They claim that the introduction of Calculus &quot;completes the indispensable triangle that imbues Tintin with its mythic quality&quot;. Asserting that here, Hergé&#x27;s &quot;art has reached a degree of near-perfection&quot;, they awarded it five stars out of five.
Michael Farr said that the scene introducing Calculus was &quot;a comic tour de force&quot; marking the start of the &quot;rich vein of humour&quot; that the character brought to the series. Noting that unlike &quot;The Shooting Star&quot;, this two-book story arc contains &quot;scarcely an allusion to occupation and war&quot;, he praised the arc&#x27;s narrative as &quot;perfectly paced, without that feeling of haste&quot; present in some of Hergé&#x27;s earlier work.

In his psychoanalytical study of the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the academic Jean-Marie Apostolidès characterised the &quot;Secret of the Unicorn&quot;-&quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; arc as being about the characters going on a &quot;treasure hunt that turns out to be at the same time a search for their roots&quot;. He stated that the arc revolves around Haddock&#x27;s ancestry, and in doing so &quot;deals with the meanings of symbolic relations within personal life&quot;. He compared Sir Francis Haddock to Robinson Crusoe and noted how the Caribbean natives deified Sir Francis Haddock by erecting a statue of him in the same manner that the Congolese deify Tintin at the end of &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;. Highlighting that Calculus is one of many eccentric scientists to appear in the series, Apostolidès nonetheless emphasises the uniqueness of Calculus, by noting that the character approaches Tintin, rather than Tintin approaching him, as the young reporter had done with previous scientists. Commenting on the introduction of Calculus&#x27; shark submarine, Apostolidès states that it &quot;allows them to cross a boundary previously restricting human beings and to penetrate into another universe, the one beneath the seas that holds secrets hitherto unknown&quot;. Ultimately, he believes that by the end of the story, &quot;the family structure is in place&quot;, with Calculus representing a father figure with financial control, and Haddock and Tintin, who have become brothers through their joint adventure, adding that with the aid of Francis Haddock, &quot;the ancestor&quot;, they are given a home at Marlinspike Hall.

Literary critic Tom McCarthy highlighted what he perceived as scenes in &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; which reflected common themes in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. He pointed out that in being a stowaway aboard the ship, Calculus was one of many stowaways in the series, and that the treasure represented the theme of jewels and precious stones which also cropped up in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;, &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, and &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;. He noted Tintin&#x27;s misreading of the parchments and stated this was one of a number of calculation mistakes that the character makes in the series. He suggested that a scene in which the shark submarine pushes between Haddock&#x27;s buttocks was a form of sexual innuendo referencing anal sex, highlighting similar innuendo in &quot;The Broken Ear&quot; and &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In 1957, the animation company Belvision Studios produced &quot;Hergé&#x27;s Adventures of Tintin&quot;, a series of daily five-minute colour adaptations based upon Hergé&#x27;s original comics. &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; was the fifth story to be adapted in the second series (and the eighth to be adapted overall), being directed by Ray Goossens and written by the cartoonist Greg. In later years, Greg would become editor-in-chief of &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine.

In 1991, a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long. &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot; was the tenth episode of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be produced, although it ran half as long as most of the others. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot;, with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.

A 2011 motion capture feature film directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson was released in most of the world October–November 2011, under the title &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, and in the US on 21 December, where it was simply titled &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. The film is partially based on &quot;Red Rackham&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, combined with elements of &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; and &quot;The Crab with the Golden Claws&quot;. A video-game tie-in to the movie was released October 2011.

<text>Tintin and the Golden Fleece (in the original French, &quot;Tintin et le mystère de la toison d&#x27;or&quot;, meaning &quot;Tintin and the Mystery of the Golden Fleece&quot;) is a film first released in France on 6 December 1961. Featuring characters from &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; comic book series written and drawn by the Belgian writer-artist Hergé, it was a live-action film with actors made-up to look like the characters and featured an original storyline not based on any of the books.

The film is set in Turkey and Greece with the main characters of Tintin, Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus searching for a treasure after inheriting a ship called the &quot;Golden Fleece&quot;. The film was followed by a less successful sequel, &quot;Tintin and the Blue Oranges&quot;.

==Plot==
Captain Haddock (Georges Wilson) learns that an old shipmate, Paparanic, has died and left him a strange ship, the Golden Fleece. Tintin (Jean-Pierre Talbot), Snowy and the Captain travel to Istanbul only to find it&#x27;s an old cargo ship in a dilapidated state. On board, they meet the ship&#x27;s cook Clodion, and Paparanic&#x27;s pet parrot Romulus. A businessman named Anton Karabine (Demetrios Myrat) arrives and says he is an old friend of the Captain&#x27;s shipmate. He offers them a &quot;sentimental&quot; price for the ship. And they give Captain Haddock fifteen days to think it over. 

While touring Istanbul, there are several attempts on their lives, and determined to find out what is going on, Haddock decides to keep the ship. One of the clauses of Paparanic&#x27;s will was that on accepting the ship, they also fulfill its current obligations, so after hiring 3 crewmen – Angorapoulos, Attila and Yefima, they set off for Athens to deliver the cargo. During the journey Tintin catches Angorapoulos (Marcel Bozzuffi) searching through the papers Tintin found. Tintin beats him up, and locks him in a room. But then later, they find that one of the lifeboats has gone, and Angorapoulos escaped.

In Athens, Tintin and Haddock go to the carpet seller Midas Papos (Darío Moreno), who turns out to be another of Paparanic&#x27;s old shipmates. Grief-stricken to learn of his friend&#x27;s death, he is shot by a man through the window before he can relate any information. Caught holding the gun, Tintin and Haddock are arrested but released thanks to the arrival of the policemen Thomson and Thompson, and on Papos&#x27; word, who is alive and recovering in hospital.

Tintin finds an old newspaper article showing that in their youth, Paparanic, Papos, Karabine, plus two strangers, were adventurers who were involved in a coup in the Latin American republic of Tetaragua, and formed a short-lived government. The article includes a photo of the five men.

Tintin later spots Angorapoulos in a barber&#x27;s shop and follows him to the local offices of Karexport, which is run by Karabine. Trailing him by car, Tintin, Snowy and Haddock follow him to a village in the countryside where Angorapoulous and some accomplices kidnap a musician at a wedding. Chasing them on a motorbike, the crooks&#x27; car is forced off the road, and the villains flee on foot. Saving the kidnap victim, Scoubidouvitch (Dimos Starenios), he is revealed as the fourth man in the photo. He suffers from &quot;memory loss&quot;, but for 1000 drachmas reveals that a large amount of gold is involved, and suggests that Tintin and Haddock consult the fifth man in the photo, Alexandre (Charles Vanel) who now lives in San Stefano monastery in Meteora.

Travelling there, they find the former adventurer is now Father Alexandre, as he has repented and become a monk. He reveals the rest of the Tetaragua story: when forced out, they&#x27;d taken a large quantity of gold from the central bank, and that Captain Paparanic had kept half while the others split the rest. Before departing, Father Alexandre gives Tintin and Haddock a bottle of wine which Paparanic gave him while visiting him last Christmas, and told him to drink only after his death. When Haddock accidentally breaks the bottle, the label is discovered to be a map to the location of Paparanic&#x27;s gold.

Tintin and Haddock return to the Golden Fleece, where Professor Cuthbert Calculus has arrived to join them. Secretly, Yefima drains the fuel to prevent the ship from leaving port, but Tintin discovers him and throws him overboard in another bout of judo. Fortunately, Calculus has invented a special tablet called &quot;Super-Cuthbertoleum&quot; which, mixed with the remaining fuel, is more than enough to enable the ship to reach their destination, the island of Thassika.

The map includes an X just off the island&#x27;s coast and, using his pendulum, Calculus locates the gold&#x27;s location. Diving underwater, Tintin discovers a sea-chest filled with long, oddly shaped bars of gold. No sooner have the members of the Golden Fleece got the chest out of the water than they are held at gunpoint by Karabine, Angorapoulos, Yefima and their men who&#x27;d snuck aboard. Haddock gets caught up in a fishing net, Snowy gets tied up and Tintin is shot at and falls back into the water, left for dead. The companions are locked in a cabin, and explosives placed to blow up the ship.

Karabine and his men take the chest back to their helicopter only to come under attack by the police, including Thomson and Thompson, led by Attila who is revealed to be an undercover police officer. Karabine gets aboard the helicopter, which suddenly takes off; Tintin has dispatched the pilot and is flying. Karabine pulls a gun, but Tintin disarms him. Beaten, the crook declares that no-one will get the gold, opens a hatch and lets the chest fall into the sea. 

The rest of the gang surrender to the police. Aboard the ship, Snowy manages to get loose, and rolls on the fuse to put it out, saving the companions.

With Tintin back on board, Calculus, using his pendulum, insists that the gold is still right below them, despite the sea-chest being too deep to recover. Thinking of the words in Paparanic&#x27;s will, Tintin chips away at the paint on the ship&#x27;s oddly shaped railings to find they are in fact solid gold, painted over. The chest had contained the original copper railings, and was just a red herring.

Back home at Marlinspike Hall, a package arrives from Tetaragua announcing the main square in the capital is renamed Paparanic Square, and bestowing on Haddock their highest decoration, the Order of the Scarlet Cheetah, as thanks for returning the gold. As the film ends, the local band helps Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, Nestor, and Clodion (their new cook) celebrate, while Calculus displays his latest invention: a flying birdcage for the parrot Romulus.

==Cast==

The actors playing Thomson and Thompson are listed as &quot;incognito&quot; in the end credits (Pedro Gamonal and Pablo Gamonal were the actors).

Snowy the dog is credited as Milou, which is his original French name.

Marcel Bozzuffi, who plays the thug Angorapoulos, is best known as the hitman pursued in the famous car chase and shot by Gene Hackman in &quot;The French Connection&quot;.

==Notes==
&quot;Karabine&quot; is a pun on &quot;carabine&quot;, the French for &quot;rifle&quot;, a hint that the character may be an arms dealer, though his business is called &quot;Karexport&quot; (&quot;car-export&quot;). The crocodile that symbolises the company (but which is red and facing leftwards) is similar to the logo of Lacoste clothing.

&quot;Scoubidouvitch&quot; comes from the term Scoubidou which was popular at the time.

==Home Media==
Kino Lorber released a double feature DVD and Blu-Ray of &quot;Tintin and the Golden Fleece&quot;, alongside &quot;Tintin and the Blue Oranges&quot; on July 11, 2023.

==Book version==
The film was made into a book, in French, English, Portuguese and Spanish. Unlike most of the Tintin books, including that of the animated film &quot;Tintin and the Lake of Sharks&quot;, it is not in comic strip form, but is made up of written text with stills from the film, some in colour, others in black and white. 
Today, the English translation is highly sought after by collectors.

<text>1-Pentanol, (or &quot;n&quot;-pentanol, pentan-1-ol), is an organic compound with the formula and is classified as a primary alcohol. It is a colourless liquid with a distinctive aroma. It is one of 8 isomeric alcohols with the formula . It is used as a solvent, a biological drying agent and in the synthesis of some fragrance compounds. It is also a common component of fusel alcohols (fusel oils), the undesirable byproducts of alcoholic fermentation.

==Preparation==
1-Pentanol is prepared from 1-butene by hydroformylation followed by hydrogenation of the resulting pentanal.
:

Pentanol can be prepared by fractional distillation of fusel oil. To reduce the use of fossil fuels, research is underway to develop cost-effective methods of producing (chemically identical) bio-pentanol with fermentation.

==Uses and occurrence==
The hydroxyl group (OH) is the active site of many reactions. The ester formed from 1-pentanol and butyric acid is pentyl butyrate, which has an apricot-like odor. The ester formed from 1-pentanol and acetic acid is amyl acetate (also called pentyl acetate), which has a banana-like odor.

It is a precursor to dipentyl zinc dithiophosphates, which are used in froth flotation.

In 2014, a study was conducted comparing the performance of diesel fuel blends with various proportions of pentanol as an additive. While gaseous emissions increased with higher concentrations of pentanol, particulate emissions decreased.

Pentanol is often used as a solvent.

<doc id="542967" wikidata="Q68178" url="?curid=542967" title="Fritz Kolbe">
<text>Fritz Kolbe (25 September 1900 – 16 February 1971) was a German diplomat who became a spy against the Nazis in World War II.

==Early life==
Kolbe was born on 25 September 1900 in Berlin to middle-class parents. His father was a saddle maker. Throughout his childhood he was influenced by his father&#x27;s guidance to be courageous and &quot;always do what he thought right&quot; and the Wandervogel movement, which beginning in 1914 also helped to develop his principled conduct and integrity. Activities with the group of fellow middle-class people allowed him to get away from his family, enjoy nature, and engage in sports.

Kolbe was conscripted into the German army as a civilian worker in October 1917. He was assigned to a telegraph unit and then an engineer battalion between August 1918 and the end of the year. After the war he rejoined the Wandervogel movement. The post-World War I period saw the formation of up to 2,000 youth groups and organizations. These were generally opposed to the government and society of the Weimar Republic; many were subsequently absorbed into the Hitler Youth, but the Wandervogel remained anti-Nazi.

==Education and early career==
Beginning in 1919, while working at the German State Railways as an apprentice, Kolbe finished school and began studying economics at the University of Berlin. He became the youngest stationmaster for the railway after he passed a civil service exam in 1922. Interested in traveling outside of Germany, Kolbe passed the foreign service examinations in 1925.

==Career==
He was employed by the German foreign ministry in March 1925 as a clerk. In October of that year he was posted as a mid-level diplomat in Madrid until January 1936. After Madrid, Kolbe was briefly stationed in Warsaw before returning in mid-1936 to Berlin to take care of his dying wife. He then worked for Rudolph Leitner and, with him, was posted in the Cape Town German consulate in 1937. While in South Africa he socialized with people who, like him, were anti-Nazi, and he was interviewed by Nazi party chiefs who deemed him a &quot;hopeless&quot; Nazi party member.

Kolbe&#x27;s refusal to join the Nazi Party led him to be assigned lowly clerical work in Berlin after the start of World War II in 1939. By 1941, Joachim von Ribbentrop was the Foreign Minister. He nearly quadrupled the size of the foreign ministry to over 10,000 workers. Many were Nazi party members brought in by Ribbentrop to increase motivation to execute Hitler&#x27;s endeavors.

Meanwhile, by diligence and skill, Kolbe had earned the trust of the people to whom he reported. He was given positions of increasing responsibility in the Foreign Office. In 1941, Kolbe was assigned, partly due to his brusque manner and intellect, to Karl Ritter who served in the Foreign Office as a liaison with the military. Ritter himself was normally physically located near Hitler&#x27;s headquarters, the Wolf&#x27;s Lair. Reports from foreign diplomats and up to 120 cables daily from German consulates and embassies were directed to Berlin for Ritter; Kolbe&#x27;s duty was to read them all and relay important ones on to Ritter. He also reviewed and summarized news articles from the foreign press. Kolbe realized that his activities were likely under surveillance, given the importance of the work and the fact that Kolbe still would not join the Nazi party. Even so, he was one of the &quot;best-informed civil servants in the Foreign Office&quot;.

Kolbe was influenced by surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch and around November 1941, became determined to actively help defeat the Nazis. Realizing the importance of the information to which he had access, Kolbe tried to make contact with the United States Embassy in Berlin in late 1941, prior to their declaration of war following the Pearl Harbor attack and the closing of the embassy. The longer he was in Berlin, the more Kolbe disliked the Hitler regime and their actions. He sought diplomatic assignments outside of Germany, one of which was consul general at Stavanger, Norway, but was unsuccessful because he would not join the Nazi party. With blank passports that he had brought with him from Cape Town, he was able to help some Jewish people escape Nazi Germany. Kolbe passed information gleaned from cables to the French Resistance, particularly when it could save someone&#x27;s life or prevent an arrest, as in the case of Cardinal Gerlier. He collaborated with Dr. Adolphe Jung for Free France, using Jung&#x27;s office to process Foreign Office documents and providing information to Jung who relayed it to the French Resistance. In some cases, the information was then sent to London.

Life in Nazi Germany worsened in 1942; there were now 56 offenses that could be punished by death, compared to only 3 capital offenses prior to the war. Millions of people had been killed by the regime. The bombardment of German cities began in March of that year. Sentiment within Germany became more critical of Hitler and the Nazi regime and some individuals within the Nazi party, including Ritter (Kolbe&#x27;s boss), shared this attitude. To maintain control through fear, the Gestapo increasingly arrested and executed suspected wrongdoers. Still, opposition against the regime grew over the course of the year. Kolbe informed the British about a spy who was providing intelligence via the German embassy in Stockholm, Sweden. This led to the spy&#x27;s arrest.

In 1943, an opportunity for espionage arose when a fellow anti-Nazi in the ministry reassigned Kolbe to higher-grade work as a diplomatic courier. On 19 August 1943, he was entrusted to travel to Bern in Switzerland with the diplomatic bag. While there, he tried to offer mimeographed secret documents to the British embassy. They rebuffed his approach, so he went to the Americans, who decided to take a chance on him. By 1944, they realised they had an agent of the highest quality, though he never received payment for his secret work. He was given the code name &quot;George Wood&quot;. His US intelligence handler was Office of Strategic Services agent Allen Welsh Dulles. By the end of the war, he had passed 1,600 documents to his handler in Switzerland.

He provided details of:
* German expectations of the site of the D-Day landings,
* V-1 and V-2 programs,
* the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter,
* Japanese plans in Southeast Asia,
* exposure of a spy working in the British embassy in Ankara which was later determined to be German agent &quot;Cicero&quot;, Elyesa Bazna

Kolbe&#x27;s reporting on the mood in Berlin and character analysis was particularly prized by the Americans, according to James Srodes, author of &quot;Allen Dulles: Master of Spies&quot;. &quot;The information he brought, plus his personal insights were unique and powerful and intensely valuable.&quot;

He was described by the Central Intelligence Agency as the most important spy of the war. Allen Dulles wrote: &quot;George Wood (our code name for him) was not only our best source on Germany but undoubtedly one of the best secret agents any intelligence service has ever had.&quot;

==Family==
Kolbe married a woman named Anita in 1925 and in March 1932 the couple had a son. His wife died in Berlin in late 1936 or June 1937. Kolbe married Lita Schoop from Zurich in her homeland in late 1937. They returned to Cape Town in early 1938, during the period in which he was stationed there, but the marriage soon began to fall apart. When the war began in 1939, Kolbe&#x27;s wife, son and housekeeper remained in South Africa, where he believed they would be safer and free from Nazi ideology. He also sought to divorce his wife at that time.

==Post-war years==
In 1949, Kolbe tried to settle in the U.S., but could not find suitable work. In 1951, he unsuccessfully applied to return to work for the German Foreign Office. Kolbe finally found a living as a representative of an American power-saw manufacturer. After the war, Kolbe was a despised and much hated figure in Germany, where he was widely viewed as a traitor. &quot;Der Stern&quot; magazine commented that: &quot;Kolbe&#x27;s story demonstrates that ordinary Germans could do something to fight Hitler&#x27;s madness - and post-war Germany treated him like a leper because of his actions.&quot;

Kolbe died in Bern due to gallbladder cancer. He is buried in Berlin at the Luisenkirchhof III cemetery. His third wife, Maria Fritsch (1901-2000) is buried with him.

==Assessment==
In 2003 a biography, &quot;Fritz Kolbe: un espion au coeur du IIIe Reich&quot;, written by journalist Lucas Delattre was published in France. A year later, a German translation was published, and in 2005 an English translation entitled &quot;A spy at the heart of the Third Reich: the extraordinary story of Fritz Kolbe, America&#x27;s most important spy in World War II&quot; was released.

In 2006 British author Nigel West reviewed the biography in the &quot;International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence&quot;. West states that the value of Kolbe&#x27;s information had been exaggerated, as it merely confirmed intelligence already gathered by MI5, or even unwittingly jeopardized operations such as ULTRA and TRIPLEX, of which Dulles would have been largely ignorant. West concludes that Kolbe was &quot;an exceptional character in every way, but also a menace bearing unwanted gifts to an eager suitor&quot;, adding that &quot;it is doubtful that Kolbe could ever be considered &#x27;the most important spy of the Second World War&#x27;.&quot;

Since the British turned down Kolbe&#x27;s offer and the Americans did not, it is unlikely the two sides will agree on his importance.
Kolbe&#x27;s work was officially recognized by the Foreign Office of the German Federal Republic when a hall bearing his name was inaugurated in the ministry in 2004. He was listed at the Memorial to the German Resistance in 2005/2006.

<text>1-Hexanol (IUPAC name hexan-1-ol) is an organic alcohol with a six-carbon chain and a condensed structural formula of CH3(CH2)5OH. This colorless liquid is slightly soluble in water, but miscible with diethyl ether and ethanol. Two additional straight chain isomers of 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, exist, both of which differing by the location of the hydroxyl group. Many isomeric alcohols have the formula C6H13OH. It is used in the perfume industry.

==Preparation==
Hexanol is produced industrially by the oligomerization of ethylene using triethylaluminium followed by oxidation of the alkylaluminium products. An idealized synthesis is shown:
:Al(C2H5)3 + 6C2H4 → Al(C6H13)3
:Al(C6H13)3 + O2 + 3H2O → 3HOC6H13 + Al(OH)3
The process generates a range of oligomers that are separated by distillation.

===Alternative methods===
Another method of preparation entails hydroformylation of 1-pentene followed by hydrogenation of the resulting aldehydes. This method is practiced in industry to produce mixtures of isomeric C6-alcohols, which are precursors to plasticizers.

In principle, 1-hexene could be converted to 1-hexanol by hydroboration (diborane in tetrahydrofuran followed by treatment with hydrogen peroxide and sodium hydroxide):


This method is instructive and useful in laboratory synthesis but of no practical relevance because of the commercial availability of inexpensive 1-hexanol from ethylene.

==Occurrence in nature==
1-Hexanol is believed to be a component of the odour of freshly mown grass. Alarm pheromones emitted by the Koschevnikov gland of honey bees contain 1-hexanol. It also is partly responsible for the fragrance of strawberries.

==See also==

* Cis-3-Hexenal, another volatile organic compound, is also considered responsible for the freshly mowed grass odor.

<text>1-Heptanol is an alcohol with a seven carbon chain and the structural formula of CH3(CH2)6OH. It is a clear colorless liquid that is very slightly soluble in water, but miscible with ether and ethanol.

==Overview==
There are three other isomers of heptanol that have a straight chain, 2-heptanol, 3-heptanol, and 4-heptanol, which differ by the location of the alcohol functional group.

Heptanol is commonly used in cardiac electrophysiology experiments to block gap junctions and increase axial resistance between myocytes. Increasing axial resistance will decrease conduction velocity and increase the heart&#x27;s susceptibility to reentrant excitation and sustained arrhythmias. 

1-Heptanol has a pleasant smell and is used in cosmetics for its fragrance.

<text>Alannah Myles (née Byles; born December 25, 1958) is a Canadian singer-songwriter who has won both a Grammy and a Juno Award for the song &quot;Black Velvet&quot;. The song was a top-ten hit in Canada and a number one hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1990.

== Early life ==
Myles was born Alannah Byles on Christmas Day, 1958 in Toronto, Ontario. She is the daughter of William Douglas Byles, a pioneer in the Canadian broadcasting industry who was inducted into the Canadian Association of Broadcasters&#x27; Hall of Fame in 1997. She is the second of five children. Raised by her parents in Ontario, Myles spent her childhood composing and learning music. Myles began writing songs around age 9 and performed in a songwriting group for the Kiwanis Music Festival in Toronto at age 12.

==Career==
At the age of 18, she began performing solo gigs in southern Ontario, eventually meeting Christopher Ward, a recording artist and songwriter with Warner Music Group. With Ward&#x27;s help, she formed her own band and performed cover versions of rock and blues songs while polishing her own material.

Myles changed her surname from Byles at the age of 19 after deciding to pursue a career in entertainment. Appearances in TV commercials paid for music demos that led to numerous rejections in Canada until she recorded masters for three songs; &quot;Who Loves You&quot; and a video demo for &quot;Just One Kiss&quot;, directed by photographer Deborah Samuel. With matched financing from her songwriting collaborator, MuchMusic (City TV) and program director Christopher Ward, she signed her first record contract with Atlantic Records in 1987.

Myles was featured in several TV and film productions as a guest host and actor prior to becoming a recording artist. She appeared in a 1984 episode of the television series &quot;The Kids of Degrassi Street&quot;, in which she played the role of an aspiring singer and single mother. In 1989, she appeared in an episode of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, which aired only three weeks after the release of her self-titled debut album.

Myles was a candidate to be the original host of FashionTelevision, as shared by Jeanne Beker on the &quot;Reinvention of the VJ&quot; podcast, hosted by Erica Ehm. Beker suggested that Ward was lobbying for Myles to get the role on the new TV program. Beker would eventually become the program&#x27;s first host.

In late 1987, Warner Music Canada&#x27;s director of artists and repertoire (A&amp;R), Bob Roper, sent Myles&#x27;s three-song video package to all of Warner Music Group&#x27;s US affiliates, which garnered a contract for seven or eight years from Atlantic Records (WMG), given by head of A&amp;R Tunc Erim and Atlantic label founder Ahmet Ertegun. Myles left her acting career and co-wrote and recorded the remainder of her first album with Christopher Ward and producer David Tyson. In 1989, Atlantic Records released her self-titled debut album, and Myles toured internationally for 18 months. The album was the first debut album from a Canadian artist to be certified Diamond by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for sales of over one million units. Her first album was reported to have sold more than six million copies internationally.

In May 1989, Warner Music in Canada released &quot;Alannah Myles&quot;, which produced four Top 40 hits, including &quot;Love Is&quot;, &quot;Lover Of Mine&quot;, &quot;Still Got This Thing&quot; and her number-one classic rock hit, &quot;Black Velvet&quot;. Atlantic Records&#x27; 1989 debut album release was ineligible for Grammy nominations until the early 1990 US single release &quot;Black Velvet&quot; became a number-one hit, claiming ASCAP&#x27;s most played song on radio for 1989 and 1990. By 2005, it had received ASCAP Millionaire Award for over four million radio airplays. &quot;Black Velvet&quot; won Myles the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Performance in 1991 and three Juno Awards.

In 1992, Myles was nominated for a second Grammy award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for her second CD &quot;Rockinghorse&quot;. &quot;Song Instead Of a Kiss&quot;, written and composed by Myles, Nancy Simmonds, and Canadian poet Robert Priest, was a 60-piece orchestrated ballad that reached number one on several radio stations around the globe but was met with little response in America, whose audiences were accustomed to &quot;that slow southern style&quot; of &quot;Black Velvet&quot;. The album, released that year, included the other hit singles &quot;Our World, Our Times&quot;, and &quot;Sonny, Say You Will&quot;. Myles received a Grammy nomination for &quot;Rockinghorse&quot; and several global awards, including a Juno and Much Music&#x27;s People&#x27;s Choice Award for &quot;Our World, Our Times&quot;.

In 1991, Myles sang &quot;O Canada&quot; at a Major League Baseball game at Skydome in Toronto. It was broadcast on CBS Sports.

In 1995, Myles released her final album on Atlantic Records before being released from the label, granting Warner/Atlantic a &quot;Best Of&quot; CD after only three records. The &quot;A-lan-nah&quot; album, which contained no Top 40 singles, included two tracks which made it into the Top 100, namely &quot;Family Secret&quot; and &quot;Blow Wind, Blow&quot;.

In 1997, she terminated her eight-record contract with Atlantic Records with the help of her then-manager Miles Copeland III, who immediately signed her to his own Ark 21 Records. On Ark 21, she released &quot;A Rival&quot;, which contained the Top 40 hit &quot;Bad 4 You&quot;, written and recorded by Myles, Desmond Child, and Eric Bazilian at Copeland&#x27;s Castle songwriting retreat at Grand Brassac, France. The &quot;A Rival&quot; album agreement with Miles Copeland III, Ark 21 Records was successfully terminated in 2014 with 100% copyright reversions returned to &quot;Alannah Myles&quot; by 2015 and re-released on Myles&#x27;s independently owned label, Fascinate inc.

After the release of &quot;A Rival&quot;, Myles released two &quot;Best Of&quot; compilations, in 1998 and 2001, and both featuring two new songs, and then left Ark 21 Records. She maintained a low profile for almost a decade but gigged around Canada and Europe during this time. In 2001, Myles duetted with Saga frontman Michael Sadler on a cover of Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, released as a B-side to the Saga single &quot;Money Talks&quot;. In 2004, she released a cover of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand the Rain&quot;, with Jeff Healey on guitar, for a Tina Turner tribute album &quot;What&#x27;s Love? A Tribute to Tina Turner&quot;.

In February 2005, together with the Swedish band Kee Marcello&#x27;s K2, Myles participated in the third semi-final of Melodifestivalen, the Swedish national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2005. Their selection, &quot;We Got It All&quot;, scored very few points and finished seventh out of eight songs, yet it managed to dominate the leading newspaper and media headlines in Sweden.

Myles&#x27; first new solo release in a decade was an Elvis Tribute EP, released on iTunes in August 2007, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Elvis&#x27; death. The EP features a re-recording of her signature song &quot;Black Velvet&quot;, as well as two new songs. All three of them were later included on her next album.

In April 2008, Myles released her fifth studio album, &quot;Black Velvet&quot;, which featured a new recording of her song of the same name, in addition to 10 new studio recordings. Myles financed and co-produced the album.

In early 2008, Myles released the CD &quot;Black Velvet&quot; on Linus Entertainment, which resulted in a staggered release internationally while the indie label merged with Canada&#x27;s True North Records, followed by a video for the song &quot;Trouble&quot; featuring a jug band performance. &quot;Trouble&quot; was awarded an &#x27;Honourable Mention&#x27; as a finalist in the blues category at the 2009 International Songwriting Contest. Myles won the 15th annual USA Songwriting Competition for both Best Rock/Alternative Song as well as grand prize finalist for a selection, written and composed jointly with Nancy Simmonds for her &quot;Black Velvet&quot; CD, titled &quot;Give Me Love&quot;.

Myles&#x27; song &quot;Black Velvet&quot; was one of four selected to be covered on the CBC Television reality television show &quot;Cover Me Canada.&quot;

After terminating a six-year lease with Canadian indie label Linus Entertainment in August 2013, Myles&#x27; &quot;Black Velvet&quot; album was retitled &quot;85bpm&quot;, repackaged for her 25th anniversary with new images photographed by fellow Canadian Deborah Samuel. A newly recorded song written by Anne Peebles, produced by Michael Borkosky, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand the Rain&quot; was added to &quot;85bpm&quot;, featuring a solo played by Canadian guitarist Jeff Healey, re-released on Myles&#x27; independently owned label, Fascinate inc., digitally distributed by Tunecore.com, with audio CDs and a 25th anniversary live concert DVD, both distributed by Amazon.com in the US.

<text>An area denial weapon is a defensive device used to prevent an adversary from occupying or traversing an area of land, sea or air. The specific method may not be totally effective in preventing passage, but is sufficient to severely restrict, slow down, or endanger the opponent. Some area denial weapons pose risks to civilians entering the area even long after combat has ended, and consequently are often controversial.
An area denial weapon can be part of an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy.

==Historical methods==
===Anti-cavalry===
In medieval warfare, sturdy stakes were stuck into the ground at the bottom of long lines of ditches, positioned with a sharp end pointing up diagonally, in order to prevent cavalry charges in a given area. Even if the stakes were spotted, horsemen would be forced to dismount and effectively give up their advantage as cavalry, and become easier targets. The correct layout of these extensive lines of ditches and the control of stake size, form and placement were part of the craft of war.

An alternative cavalry deterrent, allowing quicker dispersal and providing the advantage of being hidden more easily, was the deployment of, for example, small balls with spikes, used during most of antiquity. Many variants were used, such as boards with metal hooks, as described as used by Julius Caesar. A more modern version of this are caltrops.
Passive fortification—ditches and obstacles such as dragon&#x27;s teeth and Czech hedgehogs—were used as anti-tank measures during World War II.

===Anti-infantry===
Simple rows or clusters of sharpened sticks (nowadays also known as punji sticks), and small caltrops have been used in anti-infantry warfare since antiquity. However, due to the difficulty of mass-producing them in the pre-modern age, they were rarely used except in the defense of limited areas or chokepoints, especially during sieges, where they were used to help seal breaches. Increasing ease of production still did not prevent these methods from slowly falling out of favor from the late Middle Ages onward.
Caltrops are still sometimes used in modern conflicts, such as during the Korean War, where Chinese troops, often wearing only light shoes, were particularly vulnerable. In modern times, special caltrops are also sometimes used against wheeled vehicles with pneumatic tires. Some South American urban guerrillas such as the Tupamaros and Montoneros, who called them &quot;miguelitos,&quot; have used caltrops to avoid pursuit after ambushes.

==Modern methods==
===Explosives===

The most common area denial weapons are land mines of various types, planted by hand or dispersed by artillery. Some modern prototypes experiment with automatic guns or artillery-delivered ammunitions that are fired only after remote sensing detects enemies.

Booby traps or improvised explosive devices in sufficient concentration also qualify as area denial weapons, though they are much easier to clear and usually pose less long-term danger. Temporary area denial can be achieved on a tactical level by artillery barrage.

During an armed conflict there are several methods of countering land mines. These include using armored vehicles to negate the effects of anti-personnel land mines. Land mines can also be cleared either by hand, or by using specialised equipment such as tanks equipped with flails. Explosives can also be used to clear mine fields, either by artillery bombardment, or with specialised charges such as Bangalore torpedoes, the anti-personnel obstacle breaching system and the Python minefield breaching system.

156 states are parties to the Ottawa Treaty under which they have agreed not to use, stockpile, produce or transfer anti-personnel mines.

===CBRNE agents===
Various CBRNE (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive) weapons can be used for area denial, as long as the agent is long-lasting. Fallout from nuclear weapons might be used in such a role. While never actually employed in this form, its use had been suggested by Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War, who proposed spreading radioactive waste across transportation corridors to inhibit the movement of Chinese and North Korean forces. 

Anthrax spores can contaminate the ground for long periods of time, thus providing a form of area denial. However, the short-term (tactical) effects are likely to be low - the psychological effects on an opponent would likely be more significant.

The massive use of defoliants such as Agent Orange can be used as an interdiction measure because they leave areas empty of any form of vegetation cover. In the desert-like terrain that ensues, it is impossible for the enemy to travel without being seen, and there is little cover in case of an attack, especially from the air.

Many chemical weapons also produce toxic effects on any personnel in an affected area. However, this usually has no tactical value, as the effects of indirect exposure do not develop fast or substantially enough - though again, the psychological effect upon an enemy aware of the chemical usage may be considerable. There are however some chemical agents that are by design non-degrading, such as the nerve agent VX. Sulfur mustard (mustard gas) was extensively used by both German and allied forces on the west front in World War I as an effective area-denial weapon, usually through contaminating large land stripes by extensive shelling with HD/Gelbkreuz ordnance. Since sulfur mustard is very persistent, involatile, hard-to-decontaminate and highly effective in inflicting debilitating casualties at even low doses, this tactic proved to be very effective.

===Targeted===

To address some of the problems with land-mines (see ), weapons manufacturers are now experimenting with area-denial weapons which need human command to operate. Such systems are usually envisioned as a combination of either explosives, pre-targeted artillery shelling or smartguns with remote sensing equipment (sound, vibration, sight/thermal). By not posing a long-term risk, and by having some level of IFF capability (automatic or human-decision-based), these systems aim to achieve compliance with the Ottawa Treaty, as for example the Metal Storm ADWS (Area Denial Weapons System).

==Drawbacks==

As area denial weapons do not discriminate between friend, foe, or civilian, they make the affected zone hazardous for all trying to enter. Concepts for area denial weapons which do discriminate (by active sensing) have often been proposed, but have not yet reached a stage of general usefulness, due to their high complexity (and cost) and the risk of misidentification.

Explosive-based area-denial weapons (mines) may be intentionally equipped with detonators which degrade over time, either exploding them or rendering them relatively harmless. Even in these cases, unexploded munitions often pose significant risk.

<doc id="542982" wikidata="Q2638952" url="?curid=542982" title="David Brown (entrepreneur)">
<text>Sir David Brown (10 May 1904 – 3 September 1993) was an English industrialist, managing director of his grandfather&#x27;s gear and machine tool business David Brown Limited and more recently David Brown Tractors, and once the owner of shipbuilders Vosper Thorneycroft and car manufacturers Aston Martin and Lagonda.

==Early life==

Brown was born in Park Cottage in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, to Caroline and Frank Brown in 1904. Park Cottage was demolished in the Second World War to make way for a new factory, on their 17-acre Park Works site.

Brown attended King James&#x27;s School in Almondbury and Rossall School in Lancashire.

==David Brown &amp; Sons==
After leaving school, Brown started work aged 17 in 1921 as if just another apprentice in his family&#x27;s business, David Brown &amp; Sons (Huddersfield), cycling 6 miles to work by 7.30 a.m.. This company, which had been founded by his grandfather David, specialised in transmission components. While his father had no interest in cars and did not drive, his mother was a keen driver and as a small child he had ridden beside Frederick Tasker Burgess on test runs of David Brown &amp; Sons new Valveless car but he did not learn to drive until aged 11.

Brown&#x27;s father offered to buy him a motorcycle to help him get to work on time, so relying on his father&#x27;s ignorance of motor vehicles, instead of a small docile motorcycle, Brown after considering a Harley Davidson obtained a powerful Reading Standard 1,000 cc V-twin. He subsequently improved its performance by modifying the engine and raced it in weekend hill climb competitions at Axe Edge Moor and at Sutton Bank.
After achieving the fastest time of the day at Axe Edge Moor he was invited to be a reserve rider for the official Douglas motorcycle team to complete at the next Isle of Man TT. While he attended the practice session, his father forbade him from competing in the competition.

By this time Brown was romantically involved with Daisy Muriel Firth, three years his senior. In an attempt to break up the relationship, his father sent Brown to the Union of South Africa in 1922 to assist a director of the company in overseeing the installation of the company&#x27;s gears in gold mines near Johannesburg. When the director&#x27;s drinking affected his ability to do the work, Brown took over responsibility for the project.

Upon his return from South Africa, Brown decided to design and build his own car. Working in his bedroom each night until 2:00 am, he designed a 1.5-litre twin-cam, straight-eight engine. Then using the firm&#x27;s foundry, he made patterns and cast the cylinder block, while using the machine shop to produce the other components. His father put a stop to the work when he caught his son working on the project in company time. Undaunted, Brown constructed a chassis, fitting it with a Sage 2-litre engine, coupled to a Meadows gear box. He called the result the “Daybro”. David Brown &amp; Sons&#x27; gear-grinding skills brought him early contacts with A C Bertelli of Aston Martin for gears and Amherst Villiers for his superchargers. With the consent of Villiers, Brown modified a Vauxhall which then won its class at Shelsley Walsh for three consecutive years. It was said to be capable of more than 140 mph on the sand.

As his grounding continued in various parts of their works he progressed to foreman and then assistant works manager.

Sent to the United States, Africa and Europe in 1928 to study business methods and factory conditions he returned and started a bronze and steel foundry in Penistone where unemployment was severe. The new foundry used a new technique of steel casting and was a rapid success. As well as meeting his group&#x27;s own needs the foundry made precision castings for a range of industries and uses including aircraft airframes, aero engines, electricity power stations, oilfields and oil refineries.

In 1929 he was made a director and after his uncle Percy&#x27;s death in 1931 was appointed joint managing director in 1932. In 1933 he became managing director. Under Brown&#x27;s leadership, the company significantly expanded its operations.

==Tractors==
In 1939, David Brown &amp; Sons acquired the former United Thread Mills factory at Meltham, on the south side of Huddersfield. Brown, who also owned a farm, started the Ferguson-Brown Company in 1936, building tractors with Harry Ferguson in a corner of Park Gear Works; however, they disagreed over design details, which led David Brown to design his own version, the David Brown VAK1, which was introduced to the market in 1939, with over 7,700 units eventually sold. Harry Ferguson went to America and did a deal with Henry Ford to incorporate his system in the Ford N-Series tractor, before setting up Ferguson Tractors.

The Second World War saw a massive increase in the production of gears and gearboxes by David Brown Ltd for use in military equipment. The rising income from the company&#x27;s traditional products and the manufacture of tractors made Brown a wealthy man.

==Aston Martin==
In late 1946, Brown saw a classified advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot; offering for sale a &quot;High Class Motor Business&quot;. The asking price was £30,000. On inquiring further Brown discovered that the company was Aston Martin. A few days later Brown visited the company&#x27;s headquarters at Feltham and test drove their new prototype design, the Atom.

While he felt it had good road handling he considered that its 2.0 litre four cylinder pushrod engine lacked power. However, seeing its potential, he entered into negotiations which ended in February 1947 with his acquiring the company for £20,500.
Following the purchase, work began on converting the Atom into a production car. While the prototype was a saloon, Brown preferred convertibles so the chassis was redesigned to accommodate an open top. Eventually it entered production as the Aston Martin 2-Litre Sports, now commonly called the DB1.

==Lagonda==
In 1947, Brown heard through Tony Scratchard, the distributor of Lagonda cars in Bradford, that Lagonda was in financial trouble and was for sale. While he initially took no interest in the company, when a liquidator was later appointed to sell off the company&#x27;s assets, Brown, sensing an opportunity, visited the company. There he met with the famed engine designer W. O. Bentley, who showed him an engine called the LB6 which he had been working on for the company. It was a modern twin-cam 6-cylinder engine of 2,580 cc. Brown saw the engine as ideal for his new generation of Aston Martin models. Aware that Armstrong Siddeley, Jaguar and Rootes were also interested in the company and the liquidator was seeking offers of £250,000, Brown still decided to submit an offer, though he knew it would be the lowest. Because of the tight economic conditions and the rationing of steel, the other bidders dropped out. While the liquidator was able to sell the factory buildings to another company, to Brown&#x27;s surprise he was able to obtain for £52,500 the rest of the company as well as the rights to the new engine.

As Lagonda had to vacate its premises, Brown stored his new assets in some rented hangars at the London Air Park in Hanworth, which was close to the Aston Martin factory. The newly acquired engine soon saw service in the Aston Martin DB2.

In late 1955, Brown acquired the coachbuilder Tickford. He subsequently concentrated all the Aston Martin and Lagonda manufacturing at the Tickford premises in Newport Pagnell.

The legendary &#x27;DB&#x27; series of Aston Martin cars, including the DB1 (2 Litre Sports), the DB2, the DB3, the DB4, the DB5, the DB6, and the DBS, were named after Brown using his initials. While at the helm of the Aston Martin company, he used a rival product, a Jaguar XJ Series I, as personal transport as it was cheaper to run.

In February 1972, with the David Brown Corporation in financial difficulties, the other members of the board forced Brown to sell the tractor division to Tenneco International. and Aston Martin Lagonda to a separate buyer.

The new owner of Aston Martin Lagonda dropped the DB model designation, which in 1993 was restored during Ford ownership with the introduction of the DB7. Walter Hayes, chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda, invited Brown to become the Honorary Life President of Aston Martin Lagonda, a position which Brown accepted.

===Vosper Thornycroft===
In 1963, the David Brown Corporation purchased a controlling interest in Vosper &amp; Company, at which Sir David Brown became chairman. The company merged with John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company to create Vosper Thornycroft in 1966. The warship building division of the company was nationalised by the Labour Government in 1977, becoming a division of British Shipbuilders. The rest of the company remained publicly quoted as a subsidiary of the David Brown Corporation. Bitter about the nationalisation, Brown left Britain to live in retirement in Monte Carlo.

===Sells the company===
In January 1990, Brown sold his shares in the David Brown Corporation for £46 million, but retained a link with the company in his role as its honorary president.

==Personal life==
In his personal life, Brown played polo at Ham Polo Club in the summer and during the winter he spent most weekends hunting; he was joint Master of the South Oxford hounds. He also bred hunters and racehorses on his farm in Buckinghamshire. His greatest success was his horse Linwell winning the 1957 Cheltenham Gold Cup. Brown was a qualified pilot, had his own De Havilland Dove, which was normally flown by his personal pilot, and he also established his own airfield at Crosland Moor.

During his life he was a member of the board of governors of the Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, the council of Huddersfield Chamber of Commerce and Lloyd&#x27;s.

He was knighted in 1968 for services to industry.

In 1926, against the wishes of Brown&#x27;s parents, who refused to attend the wedding, Brown married Daisy Muriel Firth, who he had known since he was 14. They had two children, David and Angela, both of whom entered the family business. Angela married George Abecassis, the racing driver. Following his divorce from Daisy, Brown married his secretary, Marjorie Deans, in 1955. This marriage also ended in divorce and he subsequently married his personal assistant, Paula Benton Stone, in 1980.

Sir David Brown died in September 1993 in Monte Carlo. Eight years later, David Brown Limited was acquired by Textron.

<text>Deborah Anne Boone (born September 22, 1956) is an American singer, author, and actress. She is best known for her 1977 hit, &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;, which spent ten weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and led to her winning the Grammy Award for Best New Artist the following year.

===Beginnings===
Debby Boone was born in Hackensack, New Jersey, the third of four daughters born to singer-actor Pat Boone and Shirley Foley Boone, daughter of country music star Red Foley. When Boone was 14 years old, she began touring with her parents and three sisters: Cherry, Lindy, and Laury. The sisters first recorded with their parents as The Pat Boone Family and later as the Boones or Boone Girls. They primarily recorded gospel music, although the sisters also released singles for the Motown and Curb labels that were remakes of secular pop music featuring Debby as the lead vocalist.

The Boones twice reached Billboard&#x27;s AC charts with 1975&#x27;s &quot;When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes&quot; (No. 25), a remake of the Supremes&#x27; first top 40 hit, and 1977&#x27;s &quot;Hasta Mañana&quot; (No. 32), a cover of a track from ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Waterloo&quot; album.

===&quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;===
With her older sisters married and younger sister Laury in college, Boone was actively encouraged by producer Mike Curb to launch a solo career. Boone released her first solo effort, &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; (which had been featured in the film of the same name), in 1977. The song became the biggest hit of the 1970s lasting ten consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 – longer than any other song in Hot 100 history to that point. (In 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the song No. 7 among all songs that charted in the 50-year history of the Hot 100.) The song earned Boone a Grammy Award for &quot;Best New Artist&quot; and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop Single of 1977. She also received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance – Female and Record of the Year won by, respectively, Barbra Streisand (&quot;Love Theme From &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (Evergreen)&quot;) and the Eagles (&quot;Hotel California&quot;). &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; also succeeded on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary (No. 1 for one week) and Country (No. 4) singles charts. The single and the album (No. 6 Pop, No. 6 Country) of the same name were both certified platinum.

The song, written and produced by Joe Brooks, was from the film of the same name. Brooks earned Song of the Year awards at both the 1978 Grammys and Oscars for writing the song. (Boone performed the song at both awards shows.) Boone&#x27;s version was not used in the film, nor featured on its soundtrack. The song was lip-synched in the film by its star, Didi Conn, performing to vocals recorded by Kacey Cisyk. It was written as a love song, but Boone interpreted the song as inspirational and stated that she recorded the song for God.

Boone&#x27;s overnight success led to a tour with her father and frequent television appearances, but she was unable to maintain her success in pop music after &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;. Her follow-up single, &quot;California&quot; (also written and produced by Joe Brooks), peaked at No. 50 Pop and No. 20 AC, and was included on Boone&#x27;s second album, &quot;Midstream&quot;, which faltered at No. 147 Pop. Her next single, the double-sided &quot;God Knows&quot;/&quot;Baby I&#x27;m Yours&quot;, also struggled, peaking at No. 74 Pop, becoming her last entry on the Hot 100. However, the single charted AC (No. 14) and returned Boone to the country chart (No. 22). Boone then released another film theme, &quot;When You&#x27;re Loved&quot;, from &quot;The Magic of Lassie&quot;. Like &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;, the song was nominated for an Academy Award for its composers, the Sherman Brothers, but it failed to replicate the success of her first single, charting only No. 48 AC. Boone&#x27;s wholesome persona contrasted with the image-conscious pop-music industry, leading her career in different musical directions.

===Country music===
With the crossover success of &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; and &quot;God Knows/Baby, I&#x27;m Yours&quot;, Boone began to focus on country music. (Her maternal grandfather, Red Foley, and her father had also recorded in that genre.) Her first country single, &quot;In Memory of Your Love&quot; (1978), fizzled at No. 61. But, she then hit No. 11 in 1979 with a remake of Connie Francis&#x27; &quot;My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own&quot;. Boone released another Connie Francis cover, &quot;Breakin&#x27; in a Brand New Broken Heart&quot; (No. 25), before releasing her 1979 eponymous album. Although the album included the two Francis remakes, her next two singles were not culled from this album—a remake of the Happenings&#x27; &quot;See You in September&quot; (No. 41 Country, No. 45 AC), and another Connie Francis cover, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Somebody&#x27;s Fool&quot; (No. 48). (To date, &quot;See You in September&quot; has never been featured on any of Boone&#x27;s albums, while &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Somebody&#x27;s Fool&quot; was included on her 1986 compilation &quot;The Best of Debby Boone&quot;.)

Her next album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Love Has No Reason&quot; (No. 17 Country), was produced by Larry Butler who helmed many of Kenny Rogers&#x27; records during the late 1970s. It resulted in the No. 1 Country and No. 31 AC hit, &quot;Are You on the Road to Lovin&#x27; Me Again&quot;. Two weeks before &quot;Are You on the Road to Lovin&#x27; Me Again&quot; ascended to No. 1, Boone was part of a historic Top 5 on the Billboard Country chart. For the week ending April 19, 1980, the Top 5 positions were all held by women:

#Crystal Gayle (&quot;It&#x27;s Like We Never Said Goodbye&quot;)
#Dottie West (&quot;A Lesson in Leaving&quot;)
#Debby Boone (&quot;Are You on the Road to Lovin&#x27; Me Again&quot;)
#Emmylou Harris (&quot;Beneath Still Waters&quot;)
#Tammy Wynette (&quot;Two Story House&quot; with George Jones)

The album generated two more country singles, &quot;Free to Be Lonely Again&quot; (No. 14) and &quot;Take It Like a Woman&quot; (No. 44). The latter single charted simultaneously with her father&#x27;s &quot;Colorado Country Morning&quot; (No. 60). Butler also produced Boone&#x27;s next album, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Savin&#x27; It Up&quot; (No. 49 Country), which yielded two more country singles, &quot;Perfect Fool&quot; (No. 23 Country, No. 37 AC) and &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Him&quot; (No. 46). Boone has not charted on either the Billboard AC or Country charts since the release of &quot;Savin&#x27; It Up&quot;.

===Christian music===
Boone turned her music career to contemporary Christian music, winning two GMA Dove Awards and two more Grammys. She first recorded in this genre in 1980, with the Grammy-winning &quot;With My Song&quot;. Subsequent Christian albums included &quot;Surrender&quot; (1983), &quot;Choose Life&quot; (1985), &quot;Friends For Life&quot; (1987), and &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot; (1989).

In 1989, Boone released her Christmas album &quot;Home For Christmas&quot;, which boasted a duet with her mother-in-law, Rosemary Clooney, on Clooney&#x27;s signature song &quot;White Christmas&quot;.

===Television/theatrical career===

Boone debuted as a screen actress in 1978, in an original television musical adaptation of O. Henry&#x27;s &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; co-starring John Rubinstein. A frequent variety show guest star, Boone also headlined two of her own NBC television music specials – &quot;The Same Old Brand New Me&quot; (1980) and &quot;One Step Closer&quot; (1982). In 1984, Boone co-starred in the television movie &quot;Sins of the Past&quot; as Clarissa Hope, a call girl who is born again and becomes an evangelical singer: also co-starring Kirstie Alley, Barbara Carrera, Kim Cattrall and Anthony Geary, &quot;Sins of the Past&quot; became a Top 10 Nielsen hit. Boone has since made guest appearances on several television shows including &quot;Step by Step&quot; and &quot;Baywatch Nights&quot; and was featured in the television films &quot;Come on, Get Happy: The Partridge Family Story&quot; and &quot;Treehouse Hostage&quot;.

In 1981, Boone made her debut as a stage musical actress in &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; with a June showcase engagement in the Akron-based Kenley Players season followed by an eighteen-month US tour launched with a December 1981 engagement at the Fox Theater (San Diego). A critical and commercial success on tour, the production opened on Broadway in July 1982 to generally lackluster reviews, with a particularly scathing critique by Frank Rich in &quot;The New York Times&quot; being blamed for the show&#x27;s closure after five performances.

Boone has remained an occasional stage musical actress mostly in regional theater productions, although she did play the lead role of Maria in the 1990 revival of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; mounted at Lincoln Center (nominated as Outstanding Musical Revival by the Drama Desk Awards): Boone had earlier played Maria on tour in both 1987 and 1988 with 1987 dates including the Sacramento Music Circus (premiere), the O&#x27;Keefe Centre (Toronto), the Starlight Theater in Kansas City (Missouri), and the Westbury (New York) Music Fair, and 1988 dates including the Fox Theatre (Atlanta) (premiere), Benedum Center (Pittsburgh), Fair Park Music Hall (Dallas), Hilton U. Brown Theatre at Butler University (Indianapolis), and also four dates in Japan. Boone returned to the Broadway stage in 1996 to play—cast in opposition to her own wholesome image—&quot;bad girl&quot; Rizzo in the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre revival of &quot;Grease&quot;, and on March 7, 2011, performed at the Gramercy Theater in the 24 Hours Musicals original production &quot;Things Can&#x27;t Always Be Awesome&quot;. Her regional theater credits include lead roles in &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (Fair Park Music Hall, Dallas; Fox Theatre, St. Louis; Orange County Performing Arts Center/ 1991), &quot;South Pacific&quot; (Valley Forge Music Fair/ 1995), &quot;The King and I&quot; (Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Center/ 2001; Tucson Music Hall/ 2002; California Center for the Arts (Escondido, California)/ 2002; San Jose Center for the Performing Arts/ 2006), &quot;Mississippi Love&quot; (Mark Twain Playhouse, Branson/ 2001), and &quot;Camelot&quot; (North Carolina Theatre/ 2005), with more recent theatrical credits in ensemble musicals: &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; (Barrington Stage Company, Berkshire County/ 2006), &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (Candlelight Dinner Theater, Denver/ 2016), and &quot;42nd Street&quot; (Tempe Center for the Arts/ 2018).

===2005–present===
Once her children were grown, Boone revived her recording career in 2005 with the release of &quot;Reflections Of Rosemary&quot;. The CD, a fond tribute to her mother-in-law Rosemary Clooney, features songs performed by Clooney as well as other songs not thus associated, but which Boone felt showed Clooney as the person she and her family knew and loved. Boone toured extensively for the album, including several nights at New York&#x27;s famed cabaret Feinstein&#x27;s, where Clooney had often performed. In 2011, Boone released an album—and subsequent concert tour—called &quot;Swing This!&quot;, celebrating the swing music and culture of 1960s Las Vegas.

In 2012, Boone&#x27;s profile, as well as her most popular hit song, were enhanced when she became the official spokesperson for Lifestyle Lift, a company that provides facial and neck cosmetic procedures. She appears in extended TV commercials and hosts a 30-minute infomercial. In all promotions, her signature song, &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;, is pervasively featured throughout. In the infomercial, Boone is portrayed recording the song, because she indeed re-recorded the 35-year-old song, with full orchestration. However, at no time does the singer state that she has personally utilized the company&#x27;s services.

==Personal life==
Boone married Gabriel Ferrer on September 1, 1979. He is an ordained priest in the Episcopal Church. Like Boone, Ferrer is a member of a well-known Hollywood family: he is the son of José Ferrer and Rosemary Clooney, the brother of actors Miguel Ferrer and Rafael Ferrer, the nephew of journalist Nick Clooney and the cousin of actor George Clooney. The couple has four children: son Jordan (born July 8, 1980), twin daughters Gabrielle and Dustin (born September 17, 1983), and daughter Tessa (born March 30, 1986).

<text>In number theory, a happy number is a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the square of each digit. For instance, 13 is a happy number because formula_1, and formula_2. On the other hand, 4 is not a happy number because the sequence starting with formula_3 and formula_4 eventually reaches formula_5, the number that started the sequence, and so the process continues in an infinite cycle without ever reaching 1. A number which is not happy is called sad or unhappy.

More generally, a formula_6-happy number is a natural number in a given number base formula_6 that eventually reaches 1 when iterated over the perfect digital invariant function for formula_8.

The origin of happy numbers is not clear. Happy numbers were brought to the attention of Reg Allenby (a British author and senior lecturer in pure mathematics at Leeds University) by his daughter, who had learned of them at school. However, they &quot;may have originated in Russia&quot; .

== Happy numbers and perfect digital invariants ==

Formally, let formula_9 be a natural number. Given the perfect digital invariant function 
:formula_10.
for base formula_11, a number formula_9 is formula_6-happy if there exists a formula_14 such that formula_15, where formula_16 represents the formula_14-th iteration of formula_18, and formula_6-unhappy otherwise. If a number is a nontrivial perfect digital invariant of formula_18, then it is formula_6-unhappy.

For example, 19 is 10-happy, as
: formula_22
: formula_23
: formula_24
: formula_25

For example, 347 is 6-happy, as
: formula_26
: formula_27
: formula_28

There are infinitely many formula_6-happy numbers, as 1 is a formula_6-happy number, and for every formula_9, formula_32 (formula_33 in base formula_6) is formula_6-happy, since its sum is 1. The &quot;happiness&quot; of a number is preserved by removing or inserting zeroes at will, since they do not contribute to the cross sum.

=== Natural density of &quot;b&quot;-happy numbers ===
By inspection of the first million or so 10-happy numbers, it appears that they have a natural density of around 0.15. Perhaps surprisingly, then, the 10-happy numbers do not have an asymptotic density. The upper density of the happy numbers is greater than 0.18577, and the lower density is less than 0.1138.

=== Happy bases ===

A happy base is a number base formula_6 where every number is formula_6-happy. The only happy integer bases less than are base 2 and base 4.

==Specific &quot;b&quot;-happy numbers==
===4-happy numbers===
For formula_38, the only positive perfect digital invariant for formula_18 is the trivial perfect digital invariant 1, and there are no other cycles. Because all numbers are preperiodic points for formula_18, all numbers lead to 1 and are happy. As a result, base 4 is a happy base.

===6-happy numbers===
For formula_41, the only positive perfect digital invariant for formula_18 is the trivial perfect digital invariant 1, and the only cycle is the eight-number cycle
: 5 → 41 → 25 → 45 → 105 → 42 → 32 → 21 → 5 → ...
and because all numbers are preperiodic points for formula_18, all numbers either lead to 1 and are happy, or lead to the cycle and are unhappy. Because base 6 has no other perfect digital invariants except for 1, no positive integer other than 1 is the sum of the squares of its own digits.

In base 10, the 74 6-happy numbers up to 1296 = 64 are (written in base 10):
: 1, 6, 36, 44, 49, 79, 100, 160, 170, 216, 224, 229, 254, 264, 275, 285, 289, 294, 335, 347, 355, 357, 388, 405, 415, 417, 439, 460, 469, 474, 533, 538, 580, 593, 600, 608, 628, 638, 647, 695, 707, 715, 717, 767, 777, 787, 835, 837, 847, 880, 890, 928, 940, 953, 960, 968, 1010, 1018, 1020, 1033, 1058, 1125, 1135, 1137, 1168, 1178, 1187, 1195, 1197, 1207, 1238, 1277, 1292, 1295

===10-happy numbers===
For formula_44, the only positive perfect digital invariant for formula_18 is the trivial perfect digital invariant 1, and the only cycle is the eight-number cycle
: 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → ...
and because all numbers are preperiodic points for formula_18, all numbers either lead to 1 and are happy, or lead to the cycle and are unhappy. Because base 10 has no other perfect digital invariants except for 1, no positive integer other than 1 is the sum of the squares of its own digits.

In base 10, the 143 10-happy numbers up to 1000 are:
: 1, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, 28, 31, 32, 44, 49, 68, 70, 79, 82, 86, 91, 94, 97, 100, 103, 109, 129, 130, 133, 139, 167, 176, 188, 190, 192, 193, 203, 208, 219, 226, 230, 236, 239, 262, 263, 280, 291, 293, 301, 302, 310, 313, 319, 320, 326, 329, 331, 338, 356, 362, 365, 367, 368, 376, 379, 383, 386, 391, 392, 397, 404, 409, 440, 446, 464, 469, 478, 487, 490, 496, 536, 556, 563, 565, 566, 608, 617, 622, 623, 632, 635, 637, 638, 644, 649, 653, 655, 656, 665, 671, 673, 680, 683, 694, 700, 709, 716, 736, 739, 748, 761, 763, 784, 790, 793, 802, 806, 818, 820, 833, 836, 847, 860, 863, 874, 881, 888, 899, 901, 904, 907, 910, 912, 913, 921, 923, 931, 932, 937, 940, 946, 964, 970, 973, 989, 998, 1000 .

The distinct combinations of digits that form 10-happy numbers below 1000 are (the rest are just rearrangements and/or insertions of zero digits):
: 1, 7, 13, 19, 23, 28, 44, 49, 68, 79, 129, 133, 139, 167, 188, 226, 236, 239, 338, 356, 367, 368, 379, 446, 469, 478, 556, 566, 888, 899. .

The first pair of consecutive 10-happy numbers is 31 and 32. The first set of three consecutive is 1880, 1881, and 1882. It has been proven that there exist sequences of consecutive happy numbers of any natural number length. The beginning of the first run of at least &quot;n&quot; consecutive 10-happy numbers for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ... is
: 1, 31, 1880, 7839, 44488, 7899999999999959999999996, 7899999999999959999999996, ...
As Robert Styer puts it in his paper calculating this series: &quot;Amazingly, the same value of N that begins the least sequence of six consecutive happy numbers also begins the least sequence of seven consecutive happy numbers.&quot;

The number of 10-happy numbers up to 10&quot;n&quot; for 1 ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ 20 is
: 3, 20, 143, 1442, 14377, 143071, 1418854, 14255667, 145674808, 1492609148, 15091199357, 149121303586, 1443278000870, 13770853279685, 130660965862333, 1245219117260664, 12024696404768025, 118226055080025491, 1183229962059381238, 12005034444292997294.

==Happy primes==
A formula_6-happy prime is a number that is both formula_6-happy and prime. Unlike happy numbers, rearranging the digits of a formula_6-happy prime will not necessarily create another happy prime. For instance, while 19 is a 10-happy prime, 91 = 13 × 7 is not prime (but is still 10-happy).

All prime numbers are 2-happy and 4-happy primes, as base 2 and base 4 are happy bases.

===6-happy primes===
In base 6, the 6-happy primes below 1296 = 64 are
:211, 1021, 1335, 2011, 2425, 2555, 3351, 4225, 4441, 5255, 5525

===10-happy primes===
In base 10, the 10-happy primes below 500 are
:7, 13, 19, 23, 31, 79, 97, 103, 109, 139, 167, 193, 239, 263, 293, 313, 331, 367, 379, 383, 397, 409, 487 .

The palindromic prime is a 10-happy prime with digits because the many 0s do not contribute to the sum of squared digits, and = 176, which is a 10-happy number. Paul Jobling discovered the prime in 2005.

, the largest known 10-happy prime is 242643801 − 1 (a Mersenne prime). Its decimal expansion has digits.

===12-happy primes===

In base 12, there are no 12-happy primes less than 10000, the first 12-happy primes are (the letters X and E represent the decimal numbers 10 and 11 respectively)

:11031, 1233E, 13011, 1332E, 16377, 17367, 17637, 22E8E, 2331E, 233E1, 23955, 25935, 25X8E, 28X5E, 28XE5, 2X8E5, 2E82E, 2E8X5, 31011, 31101, 3123E, 3132E, 31677, 33E21, 35295, 35567, 35765, 35925, 36557, 37167, 37671, 39525, 4878E, 4X7X7, 53567, 55367, 55637, 56357, 57635, 58XX5, 5X82E, 5XX85, 606EE, 63575, 63771, 66E0E, 67317, 67371, 67535, 6E60E, 71367, 71637, 73167, 76137, 7XX47, 82XE5, 82EX5, 8487E, 848E7, 84E87, 8874E, 8X1X7, 8X25E, 8X2E5, 8X5X5, 8XX17, 8XX71, 8E2X5, 8E847, 92355, 93255, 93525, 95235, X1X87, X258E, X285E, X2E85, X85X5, X8X17, XX477, XX585, E228E, E606E, E822E, EX825, ...

==Programming example==
The examples below implement the perfect digital invariant function for formula_8 and a default base formula_44 described in the definition of happy given at the top of this article, repeatedly; after each time, they check for both halt conditions: reaching 1, and repeating a number.

A simple test in Python to check if a number is happy:

def pdi_function(number, base: int = 10):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Perfect digital invariant function.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 total = 0
 while number &gt; 0:
 total += pow(number % base, 2)
 number = number // base
 return total

def is_happy(number: int) -&gt; bool:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Determine if the specified number is a happy number.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 seen_numbers = set()
 while number &gt; 1 and number not in seen_numbers:
 seen_numbers.add(number)
 number = pdi_function(number)
 return number == 1
== In popular culture ==

* In 2007, the concept of happy numbers was used in &quot;Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box&quot;, in puzzle 149 (&quot;Number Cycle&quot;), using the sequence beginning with 4, which repeats every 8 terms. 
* In the Doctor Who episode 42, a sequence of happy primes is the password to open a door.

<text>Southern Ontario is a primary region of the Canadian province of Ontario. It is the most densely populated and southernmost region in Canada, with approximately 13.5 million people, approximately 36% of Canada&#x27;s population of 37 million. The region lies south of the province&#x27;s other primary region, Northern Ontario, although the exact northern boundary of Southern Ontario is disputed. However, its core region is situated south of Algonquin Park, the latter being in an area of transition between coniferous forest north of the French and Mattawa Rivers and southern deciduous forest. It covers between 14 and 15% of the province, depending on the inclusion of the Parry Sound and Muskoka districts which also lie in the transitional area between northern and southern forest regions. 
Southern Ontario differs greatly from Northern Ontario, having a much higher population density, a different climate, and a different culture than its northern counterpart. It is broken into smaller subregions, including Central Ontario, Eastern Ontario, the Golden Horseshoe, and Southwestern Ontario.

The core area of Southern Ontario is part of the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, which extends northeast into southern Quebec. The transitional northern area of this primary region extends north to the Mattawa River and occupies part of the Grenville Geological Province of the Canadian Shield, which also extends northeast into southern Quebec; most of Northern Ontario lies within the Superior Geological Province.

==Identity==
Southern Ontario can be distinguished from Northern Ontario because it is far more densely populated and contains most of the province&#x27;s cities, major roads, and institutions. Northern Ontario, in contrast, contains more natural resources and remote wilderness. Although it has no saltwater coastline, the region has an abundance of freshwater coastlines on three Great Lakes (Huron, Erie and Ontario), as well as smaller lakes such as Lake Simcoe and Lake St. Clair. It is a major vineyard region and producer of Canadian wines.

While Southern Ontario has been a part of the province of Ontario since its establishment at Confederation in 1867, previously forming the colony of Upper Canada, a large portion of Northern Ontario did not become part of Ontario until 1912.

==History==

The French explored and colonized Territorial Southern Ontario in the 17th century and forged relations with the Wyandot &quot;Huron&quot; people, based around the Georgian Bay/Lake Simcoe area. Other Iroquoian speaking people to the south were the Petun and Neutral Nation, and further northeast, Algonquins inhabited the upper Ottawa River/Madawaska Valley areas and the Mississaugas moved south from northern Lake Huron, settling lands in both the Kawartha region and just west of Toronto.

Following the Seven Years&#x27; War, the British wrested control of Southern Ontario, and more significant colonization efforts were spurred on by the arrival of United Empire Loyalists brought on by the American Revolution.

Southern Ontario was where a large portion of the battles took place during the War of 1812, and was a major destination for escaping slaves using the Underground Railroad.

Following the enactment of Prohibition in the United States in 1919, Southern Ontario immediately became a hotbed of smuggling alcohol &quot;(spirit)&quot; across the border.

==Demographics==
Southern Ontario is home to over 94%, or 12.1 million, of Ontario&#x27;s total population of 12.9 million (and about 35% of Canada&#x27;s total population), compared to approximately 750,000 in Northern Ontario. This is due to many factors, including the more arable land in the south, its more moderate climate, well-used transportation (water, land, and air) routes, as well as a long history of early European settlers and colonialism.

For thousands of years, Ontario has been home to indigenous aboriginal communities, with numerous nations with differing languages at the time of European contact. Over 200,000 aboriginal Canadians live in Southern Ontario today.

Southern Ontario was colonized by the French and the British. After the area began to be developed for European settlement, especially after the American Revolutionary War, other European immigrants arrived as well, with increased immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the late 20th century, many immigrants have come from Asia and other parts of the world. The region is one of the top destinations for immigrants worldwide, particularly the Greater Toronto Area.

==Economy==
The area has a large manufacturing sector. Since the mid-2000s, Ontario has produced more vehicles per year than the state of Michigan. In a cross-border definition, a swath of Southern Ontario could be considered a part of the Rust Belt. Factory closings because of industry restructuring and globalization (corresponding movement of jobs overseas and to non-unionized labour markets in the United States) have for the past few decades taken their toll. This is most evident in the region&#x27;s southern tier cities, which have large automobile or associated industrial bases, such as Windsor, London, St. Thomas and St. Catharines. Still affected by these factors, but to a lesser extent, is Hamilton, the centre of steel production, and Sarnia, the centre of petrochemical production. The province&#x27;s two largest cities, Toronto and Ottawa, have moved increasingly to a service and knowledge economy. Toronto is home to the country&#x27;s financial sector, including the major Canadian banks and Toronto Stock Exchange. Ottawa, the national capital, is home to the Government of Canada and most government departments and agencies, in addition to having a strong technology sector.

Some parts of Southern Ontario are heavily entwined with bordering cities in New York and Michigan in terms of industry and people. The focus areas are the Buffalo–Niagara, Sarnia and Detroit–Windsor. Many people work and live on opposite sides of the border. The NEXUS program for frequent travelers across the border is increasing in popularity among bordering communities. Other areas with heavy trade traffic with Southern Ontario include Montreal and the province of Quebec, parts of northern Ohio, and western Pennsylvania.

Most of the province&#x27;s agriculture is found here. That includes most of Ontario&#x27;s berry growers, who are represented by .

==Tourism==
Southern Ontario is well known for its attractions and tourism. Some popular tourist attractions include the CN Tower, Parliament Hill, Niagara Falls, National Gallery of Canada, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, CNE, Caesars Windsor, Canadian War Museum, Toronto Zoo, Hockey Hall of Fame, Ripley&#x27;s Aquarium of Canada, Royal Canadian Mint, Marineland, The Rideau Canal, the Canadian Museum of History and the Royal Ontario Museum.

Niagara Falls is the 6th most visited attraction by domestic and international tourists worldwide, with over 14 million tourists annually. In 2006, Toronto was the 14th most visited city by international tourists in the world, with over 4.1 million visitors in the year. Ottawa is the most visited city in Canada by domestic tourists, hosting over 6.9 million Canadian visitors per year.

Southern Ontario is home to several professional sports teams, including the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs in the NHL; the Toronto Blue Jays in Major League Baseball; the NBA&#x27;s Toronto Raptors; soccer&#x27;s Toronto FC in MLS and Atlético Ottawa in the Canadian Premier League; and three teams in the Canadian Football League—the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Ottawa Redblacks, and Toronto Argonauts. The region also hosts the Canadian Open in golf and Rogers Cup in tennis.

The area sponsors many internationally renowned festivals and events, including Toronto International Film Festival, Winterlude, Caribana, Bluesfest, Pride Week, Kitchener Oktoberfest, Havelock Jamboree, Toronto Indy, Sarnia Bayfest, Canada Day in Ottawa, International Freedom Festival in Windsor, Stratford Festival, Shaw Festival and Virgin Festival.

Several large legal gambling establishments have been built throughout the Province, with Caesars Windsor and Fallsview Casino being the two flagship casinos. In addition to casinos, Ontario has many legal horseracing facilities with slot machines. Racetrack slots are located throughout the Province. All gaming in the Province is overseen by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG), and the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario.

Southern Ontario has many natural attractions. Wasaga Beach, Grand Bend, Sauble Beach, and Sandbanks are beaches along the Great Lakes. The Niagara Escarpment offers hiking, skiing, and hundreds of waterfalls, including Niagara Falls. The Ottawa River has white-water rafting which attracts rafters and kayakers from all over the world. Ontario Parks governs all provincial parks, and Parks Canada governs all national parks.

==Cities==
Southern Ontario is home to both Canada&#x27;s capital city (Ottawa), and Canada&#x27;s largest city (Toronto).

Southern Ontario communities have 13 telephone area codes: 226, 249, 289, 343, 365, 382, 416, 437, 519, 548, 613, 647, 705, and 905.

Statistics Canada&#x27;s measure of a &quot;metro area&quot;, the Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), roughly bundles together population figures from the core municipality with those from &quot;commuter&quot; municipalities. Note: A city&#x27;s metropolitan area may actually be larger than its CMA. For example; Oshawa is part of the Greater Toronto Area; however, it is considered its own CMA. 

==Census divisions==
The region is broken up into 40 census divisions, including 22 counties, eight regional municipalities, nine single-tier municipalities and depending on its inclusion, one district. The line between the counties and regions of the south and the districts of the north can be considered a boundary between Southern and Northern Ontario.

This is disputed, however, as the demarcation line that is referenced in provincial documents is the Nipissing Passageway, originally an Indian trail between Georgian Bay and the Ottawa River. The trail follows the French River from Georgian Bay to Lake Nipissing. At North Bay, of land separates Lake Nipissing from Trout Lake. From Trout Lake, the trail follows the Mattawa River to the Ottawa River.

1 Muskoka and Parry Sound are commonly regarded as transitional regions between Southern and Northern Ontario. Both divisions may be regarded as northern districts geographically, culturally, and politically in some contexts.

The 2011 census revealed that the major urban divisions of York, Halton, Peel, and Ottawa had the largest growth. While the heavy industrial divisions of Chatham, Lambton, and Essex, as well as the mostly recreational divisions of Huron and Prince Edward had a decrease in population.

==Higher education==
Southern Ontario has long been an international destination for higher learning. It houses numerous internationally acclaimed public universities and colleges amongst its 13 universities and 20 colleges. It is also home to numerous private post-secondary institutions.

== Culture ==
Many notable Canadians have been based in Southern Ontario, as it is Canada&#x27;s most populated area. Toronto is notable for its multiculturalism and cosmopolitan nature: Southern Ontario also features in the literary genre of Southern Ontario Gothic, a major strand in Canadian literature.

==Transportation==
Southern Ontario has a highly developed transport system, including many highways, airports, ports, trains, and buses. The freeway system in Southern Ontario is referred to as the King&#x27;s highways system, or the 400 series highways. The freeways are digitally monitored by the Ministry of Transportation (Ontario) using the COMPASS-Freeway Traffic Management System With the long-awaited upgrade of Highway 406, all the freeways in Ontario are at least 4 lanes wide, fully controlled with interchanges and divided. The major freeways are 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407 (Toll), 409, 410, 412, 416, 417, 418, 420, 427, Don Valley Parkway, Gardiner Expressway, Queen Elizabeth Way, Queensway, Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway, Red Hill Valley Parkway, Conestoga Parkway, and the E. C. Row Expressway.

Southern Ontario also has several border crossings with the United States. The Ambassador Bridge, Detroit–Windsor Tunnel, and Blue Water Bridge connect the region with the U.S. state of Michigan, while the Peace Bridge, Rainbow Bridge, Whirlpool Rapids Bridge, Lewiston–Queenston Bridge, Thousand Islands Bridge, Ogdensburg–Prescott International Bridge, and Seaway International Bridge link Southern Ontario with the U.S. state of New York.

The region has a long history of marine transportation, with hundreds of millions of tonnes of cargo moving along the Great Lakes, and Saint Lawrence Seaway each year. The Welland Canal is a vital part of the Great Lakes Waterway, allowing ships to avoid Niagara Falls. The St. Clair River and Detroit River are also well travelled rivers between Lake Huron and Lake Erie in the Windsor, Sarnia area. Major regional ports include the Port of Hamilton and Port of Windsor, with smaller ports in Oshawa, Toronto, Goderich and Sarnia. Southern Ontario also has thousands of other freshwater lakes and rivers, as well as the Trent-Severn Waterway and Rideau Canal.

Inter-city train service in the region is provided mainly by Via Rail. The Greater Toronto area also has a commuter train system called the GO Train, which is supplemented by a network of bus services.

There are several major international airports, including the busiest airport in the country, Toronto Pearson International Airport (ranked 15th busiest worldwide by flights in 2014), Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport, London International Airport, and Region of Waterloo International Airport. Many Southern Ontarians living close to the Michigan or New York State borders use either Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport or Buffalo Niagara International Airport as their local airport.

==Climate==

Southern Ontario has a humid continental climate with four distinct seasons. The average highs in July for the region range between . The average high in January ranges from . The highest recorded temperature in Southern Ontario was with the humidex. During cold snaps, winter temperatures can occasionally drop below . The climate found over most of southern Ontario falls within the &quot;Dfb&quot; and &quot; Dfa&quot; climate subtypes, much warmer or milder than the northern part of the province due to lower latitude, presence of bodies of water, and intense urbanization.

Harsh weather is not uncommon in the region. In the summer months, Southern Ontario is susceptible to tornadoes but far more often, straight line wind damage, hail and localized flooding from severe thunderstorms. Although the majority of tornadoes rarely cause excessive damage, the region is on the periphery of Tornado Alley and (F4) tornadoes touchdown every few decades, causing widespread damage. Southern Ontario also gets hurricane remnants, floods, ice storms, heavy fog, hail, and blizzards.

Small earthquakes occur in the region. The 5.8 Cornwall–Massena earthquake occurred in 1944 and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII (&quot;Very strong&quot;).

Many tourists visit the area in the autumn months to look at the bright, vibrant colours of fall foliage.

Southern Ontario has a very different climate from the rest of the country. It is the only area of Canada that has Carolinian forest. Many trees, plants, and wildlife in Southern Ontario are not found anywhere else in Canada. Some rare trees in this region include the tulip tree, pawpaw fruit tree, and the cucumber tree. The Carolinian forests of Southern Ontario have in large part been destroyed by development sprawl. Very few original growth areas remain.

The region has the most freshwater beaches in the nation. With relatively warm waters by mid-summer due to the hot and humid summer months with significant coastlines of white sand, the major beaches in the region are visited by millions of tourists every summer. The most popular beaches are Wasaga Beach, Grand Bend, Sauble Beach, and Sandbanks.

<doc id="543002" wikidata="Q277287" url="?curid=543002" title="Bovine somatotropin">
<text>Bovine somatotropin or bovine somatotrophin (abbreviated bST and BST), or bovine growth hormone (BGH), is a peptide hormone produced by cows&#x27; pituitary glands. Like other hormones, it is produced in small quantities and is used in regulating metabolic processes. Scientists created a bacterium that produces the hormone somatotropin which is produced by the cow&#x27;s body after giving birth and increases milk production by around 10 percent.

Recombinant bovine somatotropin (usually &quot;rBST&quot;), is a synthetic version of the bovine growth hormone given to dairy cattle by injection to increase milk production.

Controversy over its safety has led to it being banned in several countries, including the European Union since 1990, and Canada, Japan, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, as it has been found to increase health risks in cows. The Codex Alimentarius has not approved it as safe.

The FDA approved it in 1993, and required that any milk advertising that its cows were not treated with rBST include the disclaimer &quot;The FDA has determined that no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST treated and non-rBST treated cows&quot;.

==Synthesis==
After the biotech company Genentech discovered and patented the gene for BST in the 1970s, it became possible to synthesize the hormone using recombinant DNA technology to create recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), or artificial growth hormone.

==Industrial production==
Four large pharmaceutical companies, Monsanto, American Cyanamid, Eli Lilly, and Upjohn, developed commercial rBST products and submitted them to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval.

Monsanto was the first firm to receive approval.

Other countries (Mexico, Brazil, India, Russia, and at least ten others) also approved rBST for commercial use.

Monsanto licensed Genentech&#x27;s patent, and marketed their product as &quot;Posilac&quot;. In October 2008, Monsanto sold this business, in full, to Eli Lilly and Company for $300 million plus additional consideration.

==Banning==

rBST has not been allowed since at least 2000 on the market in Canada, or since 1990 in the European Union (EU). Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Argentina have also banned the use of rBST.

The FDA, World Health Organization, and National Institutes of Health have independently stated that dairy products and meat from rBST-treated cows are safe for human consumption.

An EU report on the animal welfare effects of rBST states that its use often results in &quot;severe and unnecessary pain, suffering and distress&quot; for cows, and is &quot;associated with serious mastitis, foot disorders and some reproductive problems&quot;.

==History==

In 1937, the administration of BST was shown to increase the milk yield in lactating cows by preventing mammary cell death in dairy cattle.

Until the 1980s, use of the compound was very limited in agriculture as the sole source of the hormone was from bovine carcasses. During this time, the knowledge of the structure and function of the hormone increased.

With the advent of biotechnology, one of the pioneering biotech companies, Genentech, in 1981 succeeded in cloning and patenting the gene for BST. Monsanto had been working along the same lines and struck a deal with Genentech in 1979 to license Genentech&#x27;s patents and collaborate on development of a recombinant version of BST – a process on which Monsanto would invest $300 million. The two companies used genetic engineering to clone the BST gene into &quot;E. coli&quot;. The bacteria are grown in bioreactors, then broken up and separated from the rBST, which is purified to produce the injectable hormone. They published their first field trial results in 1981.

Lilly, American Cyanamid, Upjohn, and Monsanto all submitted applications to market rBST to the FDA, and the FDA completed its review of the human safety component of these applications in 1986 and found food from rBST-treated cows to be safe; however, strong public concern led to calls for more studies, investigations, and public discussions, which included an unprecedented conference on the safety of rBST in 1990 organized by the National Institutes of Health at the request of Senator Patrick Leahy. FDA approved Monsanto&#x27;s application in 1993. Monsanto launched rBST, brand-named &quot;Posilac&quot;, in 1994.

==Mechanism of action==
An average dairy cow begins her lactation with a moderate daily level of milk production. This daily output increases until, at about 70 days into the lactation, production peaks. From that time until the cow is dry, production slowly decreases. This increase and decrease in production is partially caused by the count of milk-producing cells in the udder. Cell counts begin at a moderate number, increase during the first part of the lactation, then decrease as the lactation proceeds. Once lost, these cells generally do not regrow until the next lactation.

Administration of rBST or BST prior to peak production, in cows that are well-fed, slows the rate at which the number of mammary cells decreases, and increases the amount of nutrients directed away from fat and toward the mammary cells, leading to an extension of peak milk production. The effects are mediated by the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, which is upregulated in response to BST or rBST administration in well-fed cows.

==Use on farms==
From 2000 to 2005, the US Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service survey of dairy producers found that about 17% of producers used rBST. The 2010 USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service survey of Wisconsin farms found that about 18% of dairy farms used rBST.

=== Role in synchronized fertilization on dairy farms ===
By using cows that produce offspring within a one to two-week period, synchronized breeding allows dairy farmers to artificially inseminate cows for maximum pregnancy rates with minimal effort. BST is a placental lactogen (PL) hormone and falls under the class of growth hormone, or somatotropin. It is relevant to the practice of artificially expediting placental development in farm mammals, specifically dairy cattle.

The mechanism through which the hormones of this somatotropin exert their effects can be observed at the cellular and molecular level in placental tissue. For mammals exposed to the hormone, bovine somatotropin associates with N-glycosylated proteins that are heavily involved in placental gestation. Knowledge of this and how BST works in conjunction with growth hormones allows for agricultural researchers to experiment on the effects of synchronization in farm animals.

Synchronization involves treating cattle with a dose of BST before artificially inseminating them, according to a fixed interval schedule. Synchronization and BST treatment may be used to increase first-service pregnancy rates while following this timed artificial insemination protocol. This would therefore allow agricultural researchers to observe the effects of hormones in relation to natural estrous cycles. Dairy cattle experienced increased rates of pregnancy during synchronization when exposed to BST.

The effects of BST on this treatment are dependent on the step in the estrous cycle, seeing how BST has a stimulatory effect of progesterone on the corpus luteum.

==Controversy==
Though approved by the FDA in 1993, rBST has been immersed in controversy since the early 1980s. Part of the controversy concerns potential effects on animal health and human health.

===Animal health===
One meta-analysis published in 2003 suggested a negative impact of rBST&#x27;s effects on bovine health. Findings suggested an average increase in milk output ranging from 11–16%, an approximate 24% increase in the risk of clinical mastitis, a 40% reduction in fertility, and 55% increased risk of developing clinical signs of lameness. The same study reported a decrease in body condition score for cows treated with rBST, though an increase in their dry matter intake occurred.

Another meta-analysis (2003) reported on body condition scores (BCS) but could not reach a conclusion due to lack of homogeneity in study design and reporting. They found a trend towards decreased BCS in treated cows but state &quot;Depending on the level of body condition in these cows, this effect may have been beneficial or detrimental.&quot; This analysis did not report on clinical mastitis.

A more recent meta-analysis (2014) published by the &quot;Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association&quot; showed no significant increase in risk of clinical mastitis nor other adverse effects on cow health and well-being. This review included 26 peer-reviewed studies that involved the use of the rBST-Zn formulation available to US producers in accordance with the label instructions for treatment initiation (57 to 70 days after birth), dose (500 mg, every 14 days), and route (subcutaneous).

Mastitis has cost American dairy industries an estimated $1.5 to 2 billion per year in treating dairy cows.

In 1994, an EU scientific commission was asked to report on the incidence of mastitis and other disorders in dairy cows and on other aspects of their welfare. The commission&#x27;s statement, subsequently adopted by the EU, stated that the use of rBST substantially increased health problems with cows, including foot problems, mastitis, and injection site reactions, impinged on the welfare of the animals, and caused reproductive disorders. The report concluded, on the basis of the health and welfare of the animals, rBST should not be used. Health Canada prohibited the sale of rBST in 1999; the external committees found that there was health risk to humans, and the drug present a threat to animal health, and, for this reason, cannot be sold in Canada.

Monsanto-sponsored trials reviewed by the FDA asked whether the use of rBST makes cows more susceptible to mastitis. According to the FDA, which used data from eight Monsanto-sponsored trials in its decision in 1993 to approve Monsanto&#x27;s rBST product, the answer is yes. The data from these eight trials, which involved 487 cows, showed that during the period of rBST treatment, mastitis incidence increased by 76% in primiparous cows and by 50% for multiparous cows. Overall, the increase was 53%.

Conversely, however, a study from the University of Georgia on the monitoring post-approval of rBST, showed that there was no statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) derivation in cases of clinical mastitis in dairy cows treated with rBST.

====Macronutrient composition====
The overall composition of the milk including the fat, protein, and lactose content is not altered substantially by the use of rBST in dairy cows. The milk may have a slight change in fat content within the first few weeks of rBST treatment as the cow is allowed to adjust her metabolism and feed intake. The changes in the fat content have been shown to be temporary. The composition of the milk has been examined in more than 200 different experiments. Natural variation within milk is normal with or without rBST treatment in cows due to genetics, location, feed, age, and other environmental factors. Protein in milk content has also been studied and was shown to have no apparent change in rBST treated cows. The vitamins and minerals that are normally in milk were also unaltered in milk from rBST treated cows. Freezing point, pH, thermal properties, and other manufacturing characteristics of milk were shown to be the same regardless of whether it came from rBST treated cows or not.

====Hormones====
BST is destroyed in the digestive system and even if directly injected, has not been found to have any direct effect on humans. Researchers have found that &quot;IGF-1 in milk is not denatured by pasteurization and the extent to which intact, active IGF-1 is absorbed through the human digestive tract remains still however uncertain&quot; implicating that an extensive study on the nature of IGF-1 in relation to rBST milk is required.

FDA rBST labeling guidelines state, &quot;FDA is concerned that the term &#x27;rBST free&#x27; may imply a compositional difference between milk from treated and untreated cows rather than a difference in the way the milk is produced. Without proper context, such statements could be misleading. Such unqualified statements may imply that milk from untreated cows is safer or of higher quality than milk from treated cows. Such an implication would be false and misleading&quot;. The FDA has determined that no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST treated and non-rBST treated cows.

The FDA, World Health Organization, and National Institutes of Health have independently stated that dairy products and meat from rBST-treated cows are safe for human consumption. The American Cancer Society issued a report declaring, &quot;The evidence for potential harm to humans [from rBGH milk] is inconclusive. It is not clear that drinking milk produced using rBGH significantly increases IGF-1 levels in humans or adds to the risk of developing cancer. More research is needed to help better address these concerns.&quot;

===Human health===
The effect of rBGH on human health is an ongoing debate, in part due to the lack of conclusive evidence. A few of the most debated issues include:

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a hormone found in humans that is responsible for growth promotion, protein synthesis, and insulin actions over the lifecycle. The hormone has been shown to influence the growth of tumors in some studies and may be linked to the development of prostate, colorectal, breast, and other cancers.

IGF-1 is also found in milk. Previous research has proposed an increase of IGF-1 in rBST-treated cows, but this claim is currently not substantiated. In addition, no current evidence shows that orally consumed IGF-1 is absorbed in humans and the dietary amount is negligible when compared to what the body produces on its own. &quot;IGF-1 in milk is not denatured (inactivated) by pasteurization. The extent to which intact, active IGF-1 is absorbed through the human digestive tract remains uncertain.&quot;

The American Cancer Society has reviewed the evidence concerning IGF-1 in milk from rBST-treated cows, and found that: &quot;While there may be a link between IGF-1 blood levels and cancer, the exact nature of this link remains unclear. Some studies have shown that adults who drink milk have about 10% higher levels of IGF-1 in their blood than those who drink little or no milk. But this same finding has also been reported in people who drink soy milk. This suggests that the increase in IGF-1 may not be specific to cow&#x27;s milk, and may be caused by protein, minerals, or some other factors in milk unrelated to rBGH. There have been no direct comparisons of IGF-1 levels in people who drink ordinary cow&#x27;s milk vs. milk stimulated by rBST. At this time, it is not clear that drinking milk, produced with or without rBST treatment, increases blood IGF-1 levels into a range that might be of concern regarding cancer risk or other health effects. IGF-1 concentrations are slightly higher (to variable degrees, depending on the study) in milk from cows treated with rBST than in untreated milk. This variability is presumed to be much less than the normal range of variation of IGF-1 in cow&#x27;s milk due to natural factors, but more research is needed.&quot;

As of 2014, evidence does not link rBST-treated milk with adverse health outcomes for children. Several studies have looked at the relationship between type 1 diabetes mellitus and infant feeding. Environmental triggers that may elicit an autoimmune reaction is the mechanism in which is being studied. Some studies have shown early exposure to bovine milk may predispose an infant to type 1 diabetes, whereas other studies show no causality.

The American Society of Animal Science published an article in 2014 after reviewing health issues arising from the rBST debate. The article indicated &quot;there are no new human health issues related to the use of rBST by the dairy industry. Use of rBST has no effect on the micro- and macrocomposition of milk. Also, no evidence exists that rBST use has increased human exposure to antibiotic residues in milk. Concerns that IGF-1 present in milk could have biological effects on humans have been allayed by studies showing that oral consumption of IGF-1 by humans has little or no biological activity. Additionally, concentrations of IGF-1 in digestive tract fluids of humans far exceed any IGF-1 consumed when drinking milk. Furthermore, chronic supplementation of cows with rBST does not increase concentrations of milk IGF-1 outside the range typically observed for effects of farm, parity, or stage of lactation. Use of rBST has not affected expression of retroviruses in cattle or posed an increased risk to human health from retroviruses in cattle. Furthermore, risk for development of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus has not increased in children or adults consuming milk and dairy products from rBST-supplemented cows. Overall, milk and dairy products provide essential nutrients and related benefits in health maintenance and the prevention of chronic diseases.&quot;

Keeping in mind that bovine somatotropin is a protein growth hormone, it can increase average milk yield anywhere from 10 to 15%, which in turn would lead to cows consuming substantially more nutrients in order to keep up with the increased milk production. Most of a cow&#x27;s energy consumption goes directly towards milk production. In certain areas of the world, like Ethiopia where this was studied extensively, as the cows needed to intake more nutrition to balance out their milk production, there was also an increased level of chemical fertilizers and heavy metal traces found in the milk due to increased exposure to agricultural chemicals. These chemicals can then easily be passed on to humans and lead to a contaminated milk supply. BST increases the longevity or the activity of the mammary cell leading to higher milk production and some other non-desirable side effects.

Despite public controversy of the use of growth hormones in food-producing animals, the number of violations has decreased substantially in the past two decades. For comparison, the level of antibiotic-residue detected in bulk milk tank trucks in 2012 was one fifth the level that it was in 1996. As reported by the USDA, the US pattern for milk BTSCC declined steadily from 316,000 cells per mL of milk in 2001 to 224,000 cells/mL in 2010 and 206,000 cells/mL in 2011 (USDA, 2013). Mammary health in the animals themselves has improved over this time period as well as the overall health of the dairy herd in general. This is mostly attributed to better application methods of rBST and a better understanding of how the hormone affects the animals.

===Environmental impact===
On an industry level, supplementing one million cows with rBST would result in the same amount of milk produced while needing 157,000 fewer cows. Farmers are, therefore, able to improve milk production with a smaller dairy population.

Some studies show that rBST-treated cows reduce the greenhouse gas footprint in comparison with conventional and organic dairy operations. Cady&#x27;s study showed that excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus, two major environmental pollutants arising from animal agriculture, was reduced by 9.1 and 11.8%, respectively. Carbon dioxide is recognized to be the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, and livestock metabolism and fossil fuel consumption are the main sources of emissions from animal agriculture.
* Livestock metabolism-use of rBST in lactating cows decreases the quantity of energy and protein needed in comparison to conventional dairy operations along with reducing the total foodstuff used.
* Fossil fuel consumption-targets atmospheric pollution and resource sustainability environmental concerns. With cows treated with rBST, producing a higher milk yield reduces the feed requirement which in turn decreases with electricity for milk production and the energy required from fossil fuels for cropping. In addition, the global warming potential is reduced equivalent to removing 400,000 family cars from the road.
When conventional, conventional with rBST, and organic dairy operations are compared, 8% fewer cows are needed in an rBST-supplemented population, whereas organic production systems require a 25% increase to meet production targets. This is due to a lower milk yield per cow due to the pasture-based system which is attributed with a greater maintenance energy expenditure associated with grazing behavior.

===Lawsuit against WTVT===
In 1997, the news division of WTVT (Channel 13), a Fox-owned station in Tampa, Florida, planned to air an investigative report by Steve Wilson and Jane Akre on the health risks associated with Monsanto&#x27;s bovine growth hormone product, Posilac. Just before the story was to air, Fox received a letter from Monsanto saying the reporters were biased and that the story would damage the company. Akre stated that Wilson and she went through 83 rewrites over eight months. Negotiations broke down and both reporters were eventually fired. Wilson and Akre alleged the firing was for retaliation, while WTVT contended they were fired for insubordination. The reporters then sued Fox/WTVT in Florida state court under the state&#x27;s whistleblower statute. In 2000, a Florida jury found that while no evidence showed Fox/WTVT had bowed to any pressure from Monsanto to alter the story, Akre, but not Wilson, was a whistleblower and was unjustly fired. She was awarded a $425,000 settlement. At the time of the decision, &quot;the station claimed it did not bend to Monsanto&#x27;s letter and wanted to air a hard-hitting story with a number of statements critical of Monsanto.&quot; Fox appealed the decision stating that under Florida law, a whistleblower can only act if &quot;a law, rule, or regulation&quot; has been broken and argued that the FCC&#x27;s policy against distortions or misrepresentations presented as news did not fit that definition. On 14 February 2003, the appeals court overturned the verdict, finding that Akre was not a whistleblower because of the Florida &quot;legislature&#x27;s requirement that agency statements that fit the definition of a &quot;rule&quot; (must) be formally adopted (rules). Recognizing an uncodified agency policy developed through the adjudicative process as the equivalent of a formally adopted rule is not consistent with this policy, and it would expand the scope of conduct that could subject an employer to liability beyond what Florida&#x27;s Legislature could have contemplated when it enacted the whistle-blower&#x27;s statute.&quot;

==Regulation==
Use of the recombinant supplement has been controversial. The assessment of the FDA is that there is no significant difference between milk from treated and untreated cows. Twenty-one other countries have also approved marketing of rBST: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, Jamaica, Lebanon, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Salvador, South Africa, South Korea, Uruguay, and Venezuela. However, regulatory bodies in several countries, such as Canada, Japan, Pakistan, Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, along with the EU, rejected Monsanto&#x27;s application to sell rBST because rBST increases the risk of health problems in cows, including mastitis, reduced fertility, and reduced body condition. In Canada, bulk milk products from the United States that have been produced with rBST are still allowed to be sold and used in food manufacture (cheese, yogurt, etc.) due to loopholes in the ingredient labelling system.

In 1990, the EU placed a moratorium on its sale by all member nations. It was turned into a permanent ban starting from 1 January 2000; the decision was based solely on veterinary concerns, laws, and treaties. An in-depth report published in 1999 analysed in detail the various human health risks associated with rBST.

Canada&#x27;s health board, Health Canada, refused to approve rBST for use on Canadian dairies, citing concerns over animal health. The study found the occurrence of an antibody reaction, possible hypersensitivity, in a subchronic (90-day) study of rbST oral toxicity in rats that resulted in one test animal&#x27;s developing an antibody response at low dose (0.1 mg/kg/day) after 14 weeks. However, the board stated, with the exception of concerns raised regarding hypersensitivity, &quot;the panel finds no biologically plausible reason for concern about human safety if rBST were to be approved for sale in Canada.&quot;

The Codex Alimentarius Commission, a United Nations body that sets international food standards, has, as of 2017, refused to approve rBST as safe. The Codex Alimentarius does not have authority to ban or approve the hormone, but its decisions are regarded as a standard and approval by the Codex would have allowed exporting countries to challenge countries with a ban on rBST before the World Trade Organization.

=== Abuse on dairy farms ===
Recombinant bovine somatotropin is an artificially synthesized form of the bovine growth hormone. It is legal for use as an artificial cattle lactation stimulant in several countries, including the US. However, its use is prohibited in most of Europe for reasons of consumer preference, animal well-being, and skepticism of new technology. Farmers who opt to use the synthetic hormone do so because they believe it increases milk production without other inputs. However, concerns of both product safety and livestock abuse have prompted discussions for new methods in assaying the levels of dairy cattle rBST. One proposed method involves quantifying the presence or absence of the rBST-binding antibody in serum. However, this method would require blood samples to be taken regularly and is thus considered by some critics to be too invasive. The development of other alternative methods continues to undergo development. One such example, tested by W.W. Thatcher at the University of Florida, involves collecting milk samples from the cows and analyzing them directly for the presence of the rBST antibody. Dairy cattle do respond to the rBST antigen and have shown positive results in immunosorbent trials on milk samples. Tests involving pasteurized milk samples have even shown consistent results, with immunoglobulin rBST still detectable and distinguishable despite other antibodies remaining present. Research on the viability of this new technique, as well as many others, as a means of monitoring the levels of rBST in dairy cattle continues to be an issue of practicality, profitability, and humaneness towards livestock in the dairy industry.

===United States===
In 1993, the product was approved for use in the US by the FDA, and its use began in 1994. The product is now sold in all 50 states.

The FDA stated that food products made from rBST-treated cows are safe for human consumption, and no statistically significant difference exists between milk derived from rBST-treated and untreated cows. The FDA found BST to be biologically inactive when consumed by humans and found no biological distinction between rBST and BST. In 1990, an independent panel convened by the National Institute of Health supported the FDA opinion that milk and meat from cows supplemented with rBST is safe for human consumption.

====Labeling====
The FDA does not require special labels for products produced from cows given rBST, but has charged several dairies with &quot;misbranding&quot; their milk as having no hormones, because all milk contains hormones and cannot be produced in such a way that it would not contain any hormones. Monsanto sued Oakhurst Dairy of Maine over its use of a label which pledged not to use artificial growth hormones. The dairy stated that its disagreement was not over the scientific evidence for the safety of rBST (Monsanto&#x27;s complaint about the label), but, &quot;We&#x27;re in the business of marketing milk, not Monsanto&#x27;s drugs.&quot; The suit was settled when the dairy agreed to add a qualifying statement to its label: &quot;FDA states: No significant difference in milk from cows treated with artificial growth hormones.&quot; The FDA recommends this additional labeling, but does not require it. The settlement itself caused much controversy, with anti-rBST advocates claiming that Oakhurst had capitulated in response to intimidation by a larger corporation and others claiming that Oakhurst&#x27;s milk labels were in and of themselves using misleading scare tactics that deserved legal and legislative response.

==== Ohio ====
In 2008, Ohio&#x27;s Department of Agriculture (ODA) banned the use of labeling in dairy products as rBST-free because it was deemed misleading to consumers. However, the International Dairy Foods Association and the Organic Trade Association claimed ODA&#x27;s ban was a violation of the first amendment by not allowing consumers to decide whether they deem the milk was safe and filed suit against the bill. &quot;The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Ohio, concluding that using &#x27;rBST&#x27; as a label was inherently misleading because it implies a compositional difference between those products that are produced with rBST and those that are not.&quot;

====Kansas====
In 2009, the Kansas Legislature passed a bill that would have required dairies that did not use rBST to print disclaimers on their labels that stated, &quot;The Food and Drug Administration has determined there are no significant differences between milk from cows that receive injections of the artificial hormone and milk from those that do not.&quot; The bill was vetoed in the last days of the 2009 legislative session by then-Governor Kathleen Sebelius. The legislature removed the labeling language and passed the bill without the provision.

====Pennsylvania====
In 2007, Pennsylvania adopted a regulation that would have banned the practice of labeling milk as derived from cows not treated with rBST. Pennsylvania&#x27;s Agriculture Secretary Dennis Wolff made a statement in support of the measure. This prohibition was to go into effect 1 January 2008, but after the comment period, the guidelines were adjusted to only ban &quot;rBST-free&quot; claims and instead allow claims that farmers had pledged not to use rBST and accompany such claims with a disclaimer such as, &quot;No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST-treated and non-rBST-treated cows.&quot;

==Response from milk producers and retailers==
In response to concerns from consumers and advocacy groups about milk from cows treated with rBST, some dairies, retailers, and restaurants have published policies on use of rBST in production of milk products they sell, while others offer some products or product lines that are labelled &quot;rBST-free&quot; or the like. Other dairies and industry groups have worked to assure the public that milk from rBST-treated cows is safe.

In reaction to these trends, in early 2008, a pro-rBST advocacy group called American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology (AFACT), made up of dairies and originally affiliated with Monsanto, formed and began lobbying to ban such labels. AFACT stated that &quot;absence&quot; labels can be misleading and imply that milk from cows treated with rBST is inferior. The organization was dissolved in 2011.

The International Dairy Foods Association has compiled a list, last updated in 2009, of state regulations in the U.S. for referencing use of growth hormones on milk labels.

===Response from health organizations===
* The American Cancer Society &quot;has no formal position regarding rBGH&quot;.
* The American Nurses Association supports the development of national and state laws, regulations, and policies that specifically reduce the use of rBGH or rBST in milk and dairy production in the United States.

===Response from political organizations===
* Health Care Without Harm opposes the use of recombinant bovine growth hormone due to its adverse impacts on animals and potential harm to humans.
* Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility recommends buying products from cows not injected with recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH or rBST).

=== Production and profitability ===
One study found a profit of $15.88 US per cow on average by using rBST.

<text>Jolyon Wagg () is a fictional character in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. He is a gregarious, simple, and overbearing insurance salesman who enters the story by barging in uninvited.

==Character history==
Jolyon Wagg is disliked by Captain Haddock, who finds him irritating, although Wagg remains cheerfully oblivious and believes himself a great friend of the Captain. Wagg is portrayed as a clueless tourist in the exotic places where Tintin and the Captain have their adventures. He is an insurance salesman by trade, and he often tries to sell other characters insurance. Wagg often quotes his Uncle Anatole, who was a barber.

Jolyon Wagg is based on a salesman who came to Hergé&#x27;s door and invited himself in, but also on a stereotype of what Hergé called a &quot;belgicain&quot;, a petty-minded Belgian lacking self-awareness. Wagg appears late in the series, starting with &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;, where his self-importance and insensitivity enrage Captain Haddock. Wagg also appears in &quot;The Red Sea Sharks&quot;, &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot; and &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;.

Wagg appears six times in &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot;: twice inviting himself inside Marlinspike Hall (on one of the occasions inside Calculus&#x27; laboratory), hiding from gunshots in the adjoining park, interfering with a critical radio transmission (Haddock was attempting to call the police while pursuing Calculus&#x27; captors but Wagg assumed that he was joking), repeatedly interrupting Haddock&#x27;s phone call to Nestor, and moving into the Marlinspike Hall with his family for a holiday while Tintin, Haddock and Calculus are away. Tintin, who rarely shows anger, is unaffected. However the Captain is goaded into memorable rants, for example:

Wagg cannot take a hint. He sees himself as Haddock&#x27;s friend and does not appear to realise that the Captain&#x27;s outbursts demonstrate genuine dislike for him. When Bianca Castafiore insured her jewels for a large sum of money, Wagg criticised the Captain, saying that as a common &quot;friend&quot; of his and Bianca&#x27;s, Haddock should have ensured that Wagg got the deal. In fact, Haddock sees both of them as nuisances rather than friends.

In the final Tintin album, &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;, the tables are turned when Tintin and the Captain steal the costumes from the group with which Wagg is traveling, the Jolly Follies.

Wagg has an unusual role in Tintin albums in that, unlike most recurring characters with a role in the plot, he is a relatively average human being (not being criminal, eccentric, dictatorial, or famous). He facilitated Hergé&#x27;s bringing in a more realistic, domestic mood into the later books. Perhaps reflecting Hergé&#x27;s dislike of mediocrity, Wagg never accomplishes much, except to get in the way. 

In the animated series, his role is greatly diminished. His role in &quot;The Calculus Affair&quot; also diminished. He did not appear neither on television episodes of &quot;The Red Sea Sharks,&quot; &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, nor on &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;. He also makes a cameo appearance in the televised episode of &quot;The Seven Crystal Balls&quot;, whereas in the original comic album, he is absent. (The only story in which he has a major appearance is &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;) His family has also been completely deleted.

==Naming==

Names in Tintin are not always literally translated but rather turned into a different joke. What Hergé intended in French is not possible to translate directly, however he &quot;wanted something &#x27;puffed up&#x27;, a tone which expressed at the same time fleshy and weak.&quot; Wagg&#x27;s original French name, Séraphin Lampion , is a contrast between the first name meaning &quot;seraphim&quot;, and the last name meaning a &quot;chintzy little lamp of the sort Wagg would use to decorate his home&quot;, or perhaps alternatively &quot;a show off&quot;.
