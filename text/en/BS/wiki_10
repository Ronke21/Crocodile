<text>Alwar (Rajasthani Pronunciation: ) is a city located in India&#x27;s National Capital Region (NCR) and the administrative headquarters of Alwar District in the state of Rajasthan. It is located 150 km south of Delhi and 150 km north of Jaipur.

== Etymology ==
There are several theories about the derivation of the name Alwar. Alexander Cunningham, the British Indian archeologist, believed that the city derived its name from the Salva tribe and was originally Salwapur, then Salwar, Halawar and eventually Alwar, According to another school it was known as Aravalpur or the city of Aravali.

Some others opine that the city is named after Khanzada Alawal Khan Mewati (the Muslim Khanzada prince who wrested Alwar from Nikumbh Rajputs). A research conducted during the reign of Maharaja Jai Singh of Alwar revealed that Maharaja Alaghraj, second son of Maharaja Kakil of Amber. ruled the area in the eleventh century and his territory extended up to the present city of Alwar. He founded the city of Alpur in 1106 Vikrami Samvat (1049 A.D.) after his own name which eventually became Alwar. It was formerly spelt as Ulwar but in the reign of Jai Singh the spelling was changed to Alwar. Some sources say that the name Alwar comes from the Persian word timber.

==History==
===Ancient history===
The ancient name of Alwar is Salva or Salwa. Alwar was a part of the Matsya Kingdom, one of the 16 ancient Mahājanapadas. In late Vedic texts (such as the Jaiminiya Brahmana), the Salva or Salvi tribe is described as a non-Vedic tribe that occupied Kurukshetra and conquered the Kuru Kingdom.

==== The Salvas ====
The Salvas settled along the Yamuna river and the Alwar province of Rajasthan after attacking the Kuru kingdom, and they later accepted Vedic culture by the end of the Vedic era as they converged with the remaining Kurus and the Surasena mahajanapada, near Matsya kingdom.

=== Medieval history ===

Alwar was ruled by multiple dynasties. Notable dynasties included the Jadauns of Braj, Nikumbh Rajputs, the Khanzada Rajputs, the Badgujar Rajputs, and the Rai Sahab of Rewari who took the control over this area. The Maratha Empire also ruled this region for a short period. Rao Raja of Rewari, captured the Alwar Fort from the Rajput Naruka and laid down the foundation for modern day Alwar.
Wali-e-Mewat Raja Khanzada Alawal Khan, Bahadur, son of Khanzada Zakaria Khan Mewati, was the Khanzada Rajput ruler of Mewat from 1485 till 1504.[1] He was succeeded by his son Hasan Khan Mewati as Wali-e-Mewat in 1504. In 1492 he won Bala Quila from Nikumbh Rajputs to stop the practice of human sacrifice.[2] It is also believed that the city of Alwar is named after him.

Hemchandra Vikramaditya (Hemu), born in Machari, Rajgarh, a village in Alwar, was a Hindu emperor of North India during the 16th century. This was a period when the Mughals and Afghans were vying for power in the region. Hemu captured Delhi on 7 October 1556 after defeating the Mughal forces in the Battle of Delhi in the Tughlaqabad area in Delhi, and became the &quot;de facto&quot; emperor. He won twenty-two battles in succession and became the last Hindu emperor of Delhi. In 1556, after his defeat in the Second Battle of Panipat, he was executed and Mughal regime was restored in North India. In 1781, the Battle of Mandan fought between Raos of Rewari under leadership of Mitrasen and Rajput Sardar Shardul helped by Mughals. Both side seen heavy casualties with only 6000 Ahirs defeated 25000 rajput forces. The whole area annexed by Raos of Rewari.

=== Colonial era===

Alwar State, a princely state established in 1770, was established by a Kachwaha Rajput named Pratap Singh Naruka who was earlier a jagirdar of &quot;Dhai Gaon&quot; (two-and-a-half villages) near Machari. His successor, Bakhtawar Singh Naruka, was defeated after launching an armed incursion into neighbouring Jaipur State (ruled by their Kachwaha seniors, erstwhile overlords of his predecessor) and being forced to accept the consequent treaty mediated by East India Company prohibiting him from political relations with other states without the consent of the colonial British. According to the &quot;Gazetteer of Ulwar&quot; published by the British raj, Alwar State was subdivided into four regions:
* Rath region: current Behror and Neemrana, was ruled by Lah Chauhan Rajput zamindar who had descended from Prithviraj Chauhan. Sahesh Mal was a son of Raja Sangat Singh Chauhan. Sangat was the great-grandson of Chahir Deo Chauhan, brother of famous king Prithviraj Chauhan. In accordance with the pledge by the Raja Sangat Singh Chauhan to his younger queen for marrying her in his old age, her two sons from him were bestowed the Rath area and its headquarter of Mandhan near Neemrana. King Sangat Singh Chauhan&#x27;s 19 sons from the older queen set out to seek their fortunes. Of the 19 brothers, Harsh Dev Chauhan and Sahesh Mal Chauhan arrived in the Gurgaon district. Lah Chauhan, the ruler of Rath, was a son of raja Sangat Singh Chauhan by the younger Rani whose two sons became inheritors of Raja Sangat Singh&#x27;s territory of Rath with its headquarter at Mandhan when other 19 sons from the other wives were required to quit the kingdom as per the promise of Raja Sangat. Rao NandRam Ahir rule rath and Tijara during Aurangzeb rule. Later Rao Mitrasen Ahir defeated combined forces of Sekhawat and kachwa Rajput at Mandhan. After decline of Mughal Empire, Rao Tez Singh (1766-1823) was ruler of Rath and Tijara (Ahirwal). He was grandfather of freedom fighter Rao Tula Ram. 

* Wai region: current Bansur and Thana Ghazi, was ruled by Shekhawat rajput zamindars.
* Narukhand region: current Rajgarh and Laxmangarh, was ruled by Naruka clan of Rajputs same as that of the ruling kings of the Alwar State
* Mewat region: current Palwal and Nuh districts, had the highest population of the Meo Muslims.

===Post-independence===

Alwar acceded to the dominion of India following the independence of India in 1947. On 18 March 1948, the state merged with three neighbouring princely states (Bharatpur, Dholpur and Karauli) to form the Matsya Union. On 15 May 1949, it was united with neighbouring princely states and the territory of Ajmer to form the present-day Indian state of Rajasthan. Alwar was designated as part of the National Capital Region, resulting in additional development projects including rapid-rail to Delhi and drinking water improvements. The military cantonment of Itarana lies on the outskirts of Alwar.

<text>Infoganda is a term describing dramatic or literary work that contains both elements of an infomercial and propaganda. The term has been sporadically used in both the popular media and in blogs since 2001.

==Definition==
Propaganda is a message with an underlying agenda. That agenda may be obvious or not. Typically this term is used to refer to dramatic or literary works created by highly biased government or religious entities.

Infoganda is a form of propaganda in which the message is delivered in a format that imitates an infomercial (a commercial message that purports itself to be purely informational). An infomercial is a work of commercial speech (typically a television advertisement) whose purpose is to advertise a commercial endeavor. These commercials can often include fake news anchors that pretend to be neutral observers even though they are all participants in a ruse to sell something. The combination of an infomercial and propaganda is an advertisement or show that pretends to be neutral (typically a news source) that has a real agenda of promoting the biased viewpoint of a large organization, typically a religious or government entity.

==History==
It was explained to a large audience by Rob Corddry on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot; on March 17, 2004. The Daily Show use of the word infoganda was in reference to a U.S. government video released in early March 2004 to many local television stations. The video featured a short report in local television news format that provided information about recent revisions to prescription drug coverage provided by Medicare.

Infoganda is a relatively new phenomenon. However, many historical instances of propaganda were very close to being infoganda. Filmed news reports of World War II, the Korean War, and other wars can be seen as having carried propaganda in a news format.

However, despite superficial similarities with propaganda, the term infoganda refers to a very peculiar kind of propaganda. The infomercial format that has developed in the U.S. since 1990 has a specific format, which includes fabricated names for the reporters, scripted interviews with other supposedly neutral people, a maximum use of authority-projecting (costumed) professionals (doctors, lawyers, etc.), the use of statistics in the same way that news organizations use it, and other similarities to local news. Infoganda is the use of this format to sell propaganda to the viewers.

<doc id="536663" wikidata="Q254222" url="?curid=536663" title="Tat people (Caucasus)">
<text>The Tat people or Transcaucasian Persians (also: &quot;Tat&quot;, &quot;Parsi&quot;, &quot;Daghli&quot;, &quot;Lohijon&quot;) are an Iranian people presently living within Azerbaijan and Russia (mainly Southern Dagestan). The Tats are part of the indigenous peoples of Iranian origin in the Caucasus.

Tats use the Tat language, a southwestern Iranian language somewhat different from Standard Persian, as well as Azerbaijani and Russian. Tats are mainly Shia Muslims with a significant Sunni Muslim minority.

==Demographics==

As late as the turn of the 20th century, the Tat constituted about 11% of the population of the entire eastern half of Azerbaijan (see Baku Governorate, the section on Demography). They formed nearly one-fifth (18.9%) of the population of the Baku province and over one-quarter (25.3%) of the Kuba Province—both on the Caspian Sea. Either through misrepresentation, data manipulation, or simple assimilation, the Tat portion of the population of Azerbaijan has shrunk to insignificance, facing assimilation.

The 1886–1892 Tsarist population figures counted 124,683 Tats in the Russian Caucasus of which 118,165 were located in the Baku Governorate and 3,609 in the Dagestan Oblast. The 1897 Russian Empire census recorded 95,056 Tats, of which 89,519 were in the Baku Governorate and 2,998 in the Dagestan Oblast. The 1926 Soviet census only counted 28,705 Tats of which 28,443 were in the Azerbaijan SSR and 1,237 in the Dagestan ASSR. Arthur Tsutsiev notes that a major portion of Tats in the 1926 census were listed under the categories &quot;Persians&quot; and &quot;Azerbaijani Turks&quot;. This was particularly the case within the Azerbaijan SSR, where some 38,327 individuals were recorded as &quot;Turks whose native language is Tat&quot;. The 1979 Soviet census counted 22,441 Tats of which 8,848 were located in the Azerbaijan SSR and 7,437 in the Dagestan ASSR.

==History==

The earliest mention of Persians in the Caucasus is found in the Greek historian Herodotus&#x27; account of the Achaemenid expansion of 558–330 BC, during which they annexed Transcaucasia (South Caucasus) as the X, XI, XVIII and XIX satrapies of their empire.

Archaeological material uncovered in present-day Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia include Achaemenid architecture, jewelry and ceramics.

There is little information about the permanent Persian population in South Caucasus since the Achaemenid period. Likely the ancestors of modern Tats settled in South Caucasus when the Sassanid Empire from the 3rd to 7th centuries built cities and founded military garrisons to strengthen their positions in this region.

Khosrow I (531–579) presented the title of regent of Shirvan in eastern South Caucasus to a close relative of his, who later became a progenitor of the first Shirvanshah dynasty (about 510 – 1538).

After the region had been conquered by Arabs (7th and 8th centuries) Islamization of the local population began.

Since the 11th century Oghuz tribes, led by Seljuq dynasts started to penetrate into the region. The gradual formation of the Azeri people started. Apparently, in this period the Turkic exonym &quot;Tat&quot; or &quot;Tati&quot;, which designated settled farmers, was assigned to the South Caucasian dialect of the Persian language.

The Mongols conquered South Caucasus in the 1230s and the Ilkhanate state was founded in the 1250s. Mongol domination lasted until 1360–1370, but that did not stop prominent poets and scientists to emerge.

At the end of the 14th century, South Caucasus was invaded by Tamerlane. By the end of the 15th century, the state of Shirvanshahs had obtained considerable power, its diplomatic and economic ties had become stronger. In the middle of the 16th century the state of Shirvanshahs was eliminated and South Caucasus joined Safavid Iran almost completely.

In the late 18th century Russia actively started to contest the hegemony of Iran in the Caucasus. Following the Russo-Persian Wars of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828 and the respectively resulting treaties of Gulistan and Turkmenchay, Russia gained most of the South Caucasus and parts of the North Caucasus from Qajar Iran. After that there is data about quantity and settling of the Tats, collected by tsarist authorities. When the city of Baku was occupied in the beginning of the 19th century during the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813), the whole population of the city (about 8,000 people) were Tats.

Russia more or less openly pursued a policy to free their newly conquered land from Iran&#x27;s influence. By doing this, the Russian government helped to create and spread a new Turkic identity that, in contrast to the previous one, was founded on secular principles, particularly the shared language. As a result, many Iranian-speaking residents of the future Azerbaijan Republic at the time either started hiding their Iranian ancestry or underwent progressive assimilation. The Tats and Kurds underwent these integration processes particularly quickly.

According to the 19th-century &quot;Golestan-e-Eram&quot;, written by Abbasqulu Bakikhanov, Tati was widespread in many areas of Shamakhi, Baku, Darband and Guba:

According to the 1894 publication of the &quot;Caucasian Calendar&quot;, there were 124,693 Tats in the Caucasus, however, due to the gradual spread of the Azerbaijani language, Tati was falling out of use. During the Soviet period, after the official term &quot;Azerbaijani&quot; had been introduced in the late 1930s, the ethnic self-consciousness of Tats changed greatly and many started to call themselves Azerbaijani. Whereas in 1926 about 28,443 Tats had been counted, in 1989 only 10,239 people recognized themselves as such.

In 2005 American researchers carried out investigations in several villages of Guba, Devechi, Khizi, Siyazan, Ismailli and Shemakha districts of the Republic of Azerbaijan, indicating 15,553 Tats in these villages.

==Local self-designations==
Although the majority of the Tat population of Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan uses the Turkic exonym &quot;Tati&quot; or &quot;Tat&quot; as a self-designation, there remain some local self-designations:

*&quot;Parsi&quot;—The term &quot;Parsi&quot; has been used until the present day by the Tats of Absheron as self-designation and &quot;zuvan Parsi&quot; as an indication of Tat language. This term relates to &quot;Pārsīk&quot;, the Middle Persian self-designation of Persians, cf. Middle Persian &quot;Pārsīk ut Pahlavīk&quot; – Persian and Parthian. During the New Persian language period the final consonant was lost and the ethnonym became &quot;Pārsī&quot;. Some groups of Persian-speaking populations in Afghanistan and the Zoroastrians of India (the Parsis) also use the term &quot;Parsi&quot; as a self-designation.
*&quot;Lohijon&quot;—The citizens of the Tat settlement Lahij in the Ismailli district name themselves after their village &quot;Lohuj&quot;, plural &quot;Lohijon&quot;. Lahij is the largest Tat village (about 10.000). Its isolation has prevented the local population from contacts with the outside world which has led to their own isolated self-designation. A small community of the Lohijon, descendants of the 1910–20s migrants from Lahij, live in the village of Gombori in Kakheti, in the east of Georgia. They are registered as Azerbaijanis and speak Azerbaijani as their primary language. As of 2020, there are only about 150 them left.
*&quot;Daghli&quot;—The Tats in Khizi district and parts of Devechi and Siyazan districts use another Turkic exonym, &quot;Daghli&quot; (mountaineers) for themselves. As a result of the spread of Azeri Turkic the term &quot;Daghli&quot; has strongly come into use and the local Tats started to use it themselves.

On December 14, 1990, the &quot;Azeri&quot; cultural and educational society for studying and development of Tati language, history, and ethnography was founded by the board of the Ministry of Justice of the Azerbaijan SSR. A primer and textbook of the Tat language together with literary and folklore pieces were published.

==Culture==
The Persian settlers of the South Caucasus have long interacted with the surrounding ethnic groups, exchanging elements of their cultures. Arts like carpet-making, hand-weaving, metal manufacture, embossing and incrustation are highly developed. The arts of ornamental design and miniature are also very popular.

There is a rich tradition of Tat spoken folk art. Genres of national poetry like ruba’is, ghazals, bayts are highly developed. While studying the works of Persian medieval poets of South Caucasus like Khaqani and Nizami Ganjavi some distinctive features of the Tat language have been revealed.

As a result of the long co-existence of Tats and Azerbaijanis, many common features in farming, housekeeping, and culture have developed. Traditional Tat female clothes are a long shirt, wide trousers worn outside, a slim line dress, outer unbuttoned dress, headscarf, and &quot;Moroccan&quot; stockings. Male clothes are the Circassian coat and high fur-cap.

===Farming===
Traditional occupations of the Tat population are agriculture, vegetable-growing, gardening and cattle-breeding. The main cultures are barley, rye, wheat, millet, sunflower, maize, potatoes and peas. Large vineyards and fruit gardens are widespread. Sheep, cows, horses, donkeys, buffalos and rarely camels are kept as domestic cattle.

The traditional one or two-storeyed houses made of rectangular limestone blocks or river shingles and also have blank walls facing the street. The roof is flat with an opening for a stone fireplace chimney. The upper floor is used for habitation and living areas where the family gets together (kitchen etc.) were situated on the ground floor. Typically one of the living room walls has several niches for the storage of clothes, bed linens, and sometimes crockery. Rooms were illuminated by lamps or by a skylight through an opening in the roof. House furniture consisted of low couches, carpeted floors, and mattresses. Fireplaces, braziers, and ovens were used for heating the home in winter and cooking year-round.

The property usually has a walled or fenced in yard and almost always has a garden. There is a veranda (&quot;eyvan&quot;), a paved drain or a small basin (&quot;tənu&quot;), covered cattle-pan, stable and hen-house.

===Religion===
Originally the Persians were Zoroastrian. After they had been conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, Islam became widespread. Today the Tats are mainly Shia Muslim, with a sizeable minority who are Sunni Muslim.

==Other Tat-speaking ethnic groups==
The Tat language was widely spread in Eastern South Caucasus. Up to the 20th century it was also used by non-Muslim groups: Mountain Jews, part of the Armenians and the Udins. This has led some to the idea that Muslim Tats, Tat-speaking Mountain Jews, and Tat-speaking Christian Armenians are one nation, practicing three different religions.

===Tats and Mountain Jews===

The &quot;Mountain Jews&quot; belong to the community of Persian-speaking Jews. Some groups of this community live in Iran, Israel (especially), North America (especially), and Europe. The Jews of North Caucasus and modern day Azerbaijan were classified &quot;Mountain Jews&quot; only in 19th-century official Russian documentation. The Mountain Jews call themselves &quot;Juhuro&quot;, which means &quot;Jews&quot;.

In the year 1888 A. Sh. Anisimov showed the closeness of the language of the Mountain Jews and the Tats. In his work &quot;Caucasian Jews-Mountaineers&quot; he came to the conclusion that the Mountain Jews were representatives of the Iranian family of the Tats, which had adopted Judaism in Iran and later moved to the South Caucasus. The ideas of Anisimov were supported during the Soviet period: the popularization of the idea of the Mountain Jews&#x27; Tat origin started in the 1930s. Through the efforts of several Mountain Jews, closely connected with the regime, the idea of mountain Jews being not really Jews at all but Judaized Tats became widely spread. Some Mountain Jews started to register themselves as Tats because of secret pressure from the authorities.

As a result of this, the words Tat and Mountain Jew became almost synonymous. The term &quot;Tat&quot; was used in research literature as the second or even first name for Mountain Jews. This caused the whole cultural heritage (literature, theatre, music) created by Mountain Jews during the Soviet period to be attributed to the Tats.

Comparing physic-anthropological characteristics of Tats and Mountain Jews together with information about their languages suggests no signs of ethnic unity between these two nations.

Like most &quot;Jewish&quot; languages, the grammatical structure of Juhuri retains archaic features of the language it is derived from. At the same time all of these languages are satiated with Hebrew words. The loanwords from Aramaic and Hebrew in Juhuri include words not directly connected with Judaic rituals (e.g. &quot;zoft&quot; resin, &quot;nokumi&quot; envy, &quot;ghuf&quot; body, &quot;keton&quot; linen, etc.) Some syntactical features that Juhuri has are ones typical for Hebrew.

The physical-anthropological types of Tats and Mountain Jews are also dissimilar.

In 1913 the anthropologist K.M. Kurdov carried out measurements of a large group of Tat population of Lahij village and revealed fundamental differences of their physical-anthropological type from the Mountain Jews. Measurements of Tats and Mountain Jews were also made by some other researchers. Cephalic index measurements have shown that, while for Tats mesocephalia and dolichocephalia are typical, extreme brachycephalia is typical for Mountain Jews. Dermatoglyphic characteristics of the Tats and Mountain Jews also exclude ethnic similarity. In 2012 a uniparental genetic markers comparison between Judeo-Tat dialect and Muslim-Tat dialect speakers in Dagestan found independent demographic histories.

Speakers of Mountain-Jew dialect and Tati language are representatives of two different nations, each with its own religion, ethnic consciousness, self-designation, way of life, material and spiritual values.

===Tats and Armenians===

Some 19th- and 20th-century publications describe the citizens of several Tat-speaking village of South Caucasus as &quot;Armenian Tats&quot;, &quot;Armeno-Tats&quot;, &quot;Christian Tats&quot; or &quot;Gregorian Tats&quot;. It was suggested that a part of the Persians of Eastern South Caucasus had adopted Armenian Christianity, but this did not take into consideration the fact that those citizens identify themselves as Armenians, because conversion to religion is strongly attached to ethnic identity in eastern cultures.

There are traces of an Armenian phonological, lexical, grammatical, and calque substratum in the dialect of Tat-speaking Armenians. There are also Armenian affricates (ծ, ց, ձ) in words of Iranian origin, which do not exist in the Tat language. This can only be explained by Armenian influence.

Although they have lost their language these Armenians managed to preserve their national identity. It has a distinct &quot;us versus them&quot; dichotomy, &quot;Hay&quot; (us) to &quot;Muslims&quot; (Tats and Azeri together).

==Tat people of northern Iran==

Starting from the Middle Ages, the term &quot;Tati&quot; was used not only for the Caucasus but also for northern Iran, where it was extended to almost all of the local Iranian languages except Persian and Kurdish.

Currently the term &quot;Tati&quot; and &quot;Tati language&quot; is used to refer to a particular group of north-western Iranian dialects (Chali, Danesfani, Hiaraji, Hoznini, Esfarvarini, Takestani, Sagzabadi, Ebrahimabadi, Eshtehardi, Hoini, Kajali, Shahroudi, Harzani) in Iranian Azerbaijan, as well as south of it in the provinces of Qazvin and Zanjan. These dialects have a certain affinity to the Talysh language as one of the descendants of the Old Azari language.

<text>Wooster Square is a neighborhood in the city of New Haven, Connecticut, to the east of downtown. The name refers to a park square (named for the American Revolutionary War hero, David Wooster) located between Greene Street, Wooster Place, Chapel Street and Academy Street in the center of the neighborhood. Wooster Square is also known as Little Italy: a bastion of Italian American culture and cuisine, and is home to some of New Haven&#x27;s (and the country&#x27;s), best-known pizza (specifically, apizza) eateries, including Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana and Sally&#x27;s Apizza. The square and much of the neighborhood are included in the Wooster Square Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

An annual Cherry Blossom Festival in Wooster Square Park commemorates the planting of 72 Yoshino Japanese cherry blossom trees in 1973 by the New Haven Historic Commission in collaboration with the New Haven Parks Department and neighborhood residents. The festival, founded and organized by the Historic Wooster Square Association, has grown from a modest event in the early 1970s with a local band entertaining a handful of neighbors under lighted trees to a major New Haven event that in 2016 attracted over 10,000 visitors.

== Geography ==
The Wooster Square neighborhood consists of the area between the Amtrak railroad tracks (serving as the boundary with Downtown New Haven) and Interstate 91 (between Exits 1 and 3), bounded on the south by the Oak Street Connector. It is bordered on the west by Downtown New Haven, on the south by Long Wharf, on the east by the neighborhood of Mill River, and on the north by East Rock.

== History ==
Wooster Square takes its name from Revolutionary War General David Wooster, who had a warehouse near Water Street. In 1825 the land was purchased by the city of New Haven and incorporated into the city. At that time, the area was close to the city&#x27;s waterfront (it is now farther inland due to harbor filling), and by the 1840s it had become a residential area where ship captains and wholesale grocers built large houses near the port. As a result, Wooster Square now includes a concentrated collection of distinctive 19th-century residential architecture, including several buildings by New Haven architect Henry Austin. Included are examples of the Federal, Greek Revival, Islamic Revival, and Italian Villa styles, Late Victorian Italianate row houses, and Second Empire and Queen Anne homes.

By the late 19th century, increased industrial activity in the vicinity made Wooster Square less desirable as a residential neighborhood, and Italian immigrant families began to move in and operate small stores out of their homes. This commercial activity damaged the neighborhood&#x27;s reputation, and the area was targeted for demolition and redevelopment as early as the 1930s. In the mid-1950s, plans called for building Interstate 91 through Wooster Square Park, but the Wooster Square Project, which started in 1958, began a neighborhood revival and resulted in re-routing of the highway.

Wooster Square made headlines on June 24, 2020, when its Christopher Columbus statue was removed by a city-hired crew in the aftermath of the George Floyd Protests. City officials later announced the commission of a new statue to replace the Columbus statue. The new statue, which was installed in May 2024, depicts an Italian family.

==Culture and commerce==

Wooster Square is home to restaurants and bakeries known for their pizza and Italian pastries, local businesses, and a weekly farmer&#x27;s market, City Seed. Its walkable proximity to Downtown New Haven, its architecture, and its neighborhood feel, make it one of the most sought-after New Haven neighborhoods in which to live. It also has a thriving art scene.

A sycamore tree on the west side of Wooster Square Park has been said by some observers to resemble an outline image of Jesus Christ.

<doc id="536673" wikidata="Q4743356" url="?curid=536673" title="American Chemistry Council">
<text>American Chemistry Council (ACC), known as the Manufacturing Chemists&#x27; Association at its founding in 1872 then as the Chemical Manufacturers&#x27; Association (from 1978 until 2000), is an industry trade association for American chemical companies, based in Washington, D.C.

==Activities==
The mission of the American Chemistry Council is to promote the interests of corporations of the chemical industry. The trade group represents U.S. chemical companies as well as the plastics and chlorine industries, formerly known as the American Plastics Council, the Center for the Polyurethanes Industry and the Chlorine Chemistry Council.

ACC implemented the Responsible Care program in 1988. At least 52 countries have implemented this initiative. It is managed at a global level by the International Council of Chemical Associations. Participation in the program is a mandatory for all ACC members.

It has a political action committee that gives money to members of the Congress of the United States.

ACC launched a $35 million &quot;essential2&quot; public relations campaign in 2005. &quot;essential2&quot; attempted to improve the industry&#x27;s image by emphasizing the importance of chemical industry products – especially plastics – to everyday life, and by using the term &quot;American Chemistry&quot; rather than &quot;chemical industry&quot;. ACC later shifted to a more directed lobbying and policy-shaping effort, including taking legal action against federal efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from industry.

Sometime in 2008, ACC launched a campaign to oppose California SB1713 – a bill to ban bisphenol A statewide – including bulk postal mailings in July and August encouraging California citizens to demand opposition of their representing legislators.

In 2011, it was a major sponsor of the 5th International Marine Debris Conference which endorsed the Honolulu Commitment to reduce harmful plastics in the environment.

The ACC stepped in in 2023 to prohibit the passage of the Packaging Reduction &amp; Recycling Act in New York state, spending a total $120,000 on two lobbying firms, Greenberg Traurig and Craig Johnson’s Long Point Advisors, to work on its behalf for the duration of the legislative session.

==Criticism==
The Responsible Care (RC) program has been described as a way to help the industry avoid regulation by imposing its own safety and environmental regulations and to improve its public image in the wake of the 1984 Bhopal disaster. According to a 2000 study, plants owned by RC participating firms improved their relative environmental performance more slowly than non members. The study highlighted the RC program as an example of how industries fail to self-regulate without explicit sanctions. According to a 2013 study, between 1988 and 2001, plants owned by RC participating firms raised their toxicity-weighted pollution by 15.9% on average relative to statistically-equivalent plants owned by non-RC participating firms.

Environmentalists and those concerned about the health effects of chemicals in the environment traditionally oppose ACC&#x27;s initiatives. They view campaigns like &quot;essential2&quot; as efforts to distract public attention away from products and practices that they view as harmful and dangerous. 

The American Chemistry Council&#x27;s stance on chemical regulation was heavily criticized in the 2015 documentary &quot;Stink!&quot; available on Netflix.

==Fighting plastic bag regulation==
ACC has engaged repeatedly in fighting governmental restrictions and bans on plastic shopping bags. The phase-out of lightweight plastic bags has been proposed or implemented in many countries since 2002. In the United States, in July 2008, the Seattle City Council voted to impose an additional 20 cent fee on each plastic bag purchased from stores by shoppers as a convenience for transportation of goods. This effort was suspended until a referendum could be held in 2009, allowing voters a chance to weigh in on the issue of whether they should continue to be encouraged to support industry by purchasing plastic bags without considering disposal costs. During the period leading up to the referendum vote the American Chemistry Council stepped into this local affair, ultimately spending some $1.4 million on their successful effort to thwart the proposed system of fully accounting for the cost of plastic bags. Seattle in 2012 overcame ACC objections and successfully enacted a bag ban.

In 2010, ACC was quoted by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in opposition to a California bill to outlaw plastic bags, claiming that new law &quot;amounts to a $1 billion tax added to [Californian&#x27;s] grocery bills.&quot;

But subsequent ACC efforts to prevent adoption of municipal ordinances banning plastic bags have not been successful. Over ACC opposition, San Jose, California, in 2010 adopted California&#x27;s strictest ban. The ordinance, in effect since 2012, prohibits supermarkets, pharmacies, corner shops and others from distributing single-use plastic bags, with fines for violations. Retailers can sell paper bags made of 40 percent recycled materials for 10 cents each, gradually increasing to 25 cents by 2014. In 2016, California voters approved a statewide ban on carry-out plastic bags.

According to the 2020 census, Oklahoma is the 28th most populous state with inhabitants but the 19th largest by land area spanning of land. Oklahoma is divided into 77 counties and contains 596 municipalities consisting of cities and towns.

In Oklahoma, cities are all those communities which are 1,000 or more in population and are incorporated as cities. Towns are limited to town board type of municipal government. Cities may choose among aldermanic, mayoral, council-manager, and home-rule charter types of government. Cities may also petition to incorporate as towns.

<doc id="536678" wikidata="Q2495287" url="?curid=536678" title="United Party (New Zealand)">
<text>The United Party was a political party in New Zealand. It was founded in 1927, partly out of the remnants of the Liberal Party, and formed the United Government between 1928 and 1931, and the United–Reform coalition Government between 1931 and 1935. In 1936, it merged with the Reform Party to form the National Party.

==Foundation==
In the 1920s the Liberal Party, although previously dominant in New Zealand party politics, seemed in serious long-term decline following the advent of the Labour Party, and its organisation had decayed to the point of collapse. The United Party represented an unexpected resurgence of the Liberals, and some historians consider it nothing more than the Liberal Party under a new name.

The United Party emerged from a faction of the decaying Liberal Party known as &quot;the National Party&quot; (not directly related to the modern National Party, although it may have inspired the name). George Forbes, a Liberal Party leader, led the faction. In 1927 Forbes joined with Bill Veitch (who led another faction of the Liberals, but who had once been involved with the labour movement) and with Albert Davy (a well-known and highly successful organiser for the Reform Party, the traditional opponent of the Liberals). They hoped that the United Party would draw support not only from former Liberals, but from moderates on either the right or left of the Liberals by promoting themselves as a safer alternative than the Labour Party.

The new organisation adopted the name &quot;the United Party&quot;. This reflected in shortened form the name of the &quot;United New Zealand Political Organisation&quot;, which Davy had used after he had left Reform. Forbes and Veitch both contested the leadership, but eventually, Joseph Ward won the position. Although Ward, a former Liberal Prime Minister in 1906 – 1912, did not enjoy the best of health, Davy backed him as a compromise candidate. Robert Masters was the chairman of the United Party from its formation.

The reversal of the party fortunes came in Auckland, where the big business group abandoned the Reform Party because of the handling of a licensing bill, and put forward a programme equally appealing to the business community and to the remnants of the Liberal Party. So 42,000 votes and five seats went to United, compared with 8,800 votes and no seats in the previous election.

==Success==

In the 1928 elections, the new United Party performed surprisingly well, winning twenty-seven seats. The Reform Party also had twenty-seven seats, the Labour Party had nineteen, the Country Party had one, and independents held six. The United Party formed a government with the backing of the Labour Party, and Ward became Prime Minister again.

The United Party administration did not run particularly smoothly, however. Ward&#x27;s ill health persisted, and he finally resigned in 1930. His deputy, George Forbes, became Prime Minister, though he had effectively been leading both the party and the government for some time before Ward&#x27;s formal departure. Forbes faced serious economic problems, including the onset of the Great Depression. He did not project an image of activity or leadership — William Downie Stewart Jr, finance spokesman for Reform, privately described Forbes as &quot;apathetic and fatalistic&quot;, and suggested that although he had &quot;a rotten job&quot;, Forbes was really simply marking time.

==Coalition==

In 1931 the United government passed a number of economic measures which appeared unfavourable to workers, and the Labour Party withdrew its support. The United Party continued in office with reluctant support from the Reform Party, which feared that a collapse of government (and thus a general election) would see large gains for Labour. Later the same year, formal coalition talks took place between United, Reform, and Labour, with a &quot;unity government&quot; proposed to counter the depression. Labour eventually walked out of the talks, but Reform leader Gordon Coates (pressed by Downie Stewart) eventually agreed to form a coalition between United and Reform. Forbes, backed by dissident members of Reform, won the leadership of the coalition government, but Downie Stewart of Reform became the Minister of Finance.

In the 1931 elections, the coalition worked in close co-operation and won fifty-one out of the eighty seats. United and Reform between them had held a few more seats before, but their combined tally exceeded what many had anticipated in light of the economic conditions. The government did not exhibit great stability, however — particularly strong tensions arose between Coates and Downie Stewart, who clashed over the best response to the country&#x27;s economic problems. Coates eventually won, and Stewart resigned. Coates, as the new Minister of Finance, became increasingly powerful, and the weary Forbes did not strongly oppose Coates&#x27;s influence; while Forbes remained Prime Minister, Coates effectively led the government. The economic situation persisted.

In the 1935 elections, United and Reform maintained their coalition. Anger at the country&#x27;s ongoing economic problems remained high, however, and many saw Forbes and Coates as jointly responsible for the situation. In addition, Albert Davy had founded a new &quot;anti-socialist&quot; party, the Democrats, which took votes away from the coalition. Forbes, still the nominal leader of the coalition, appeared tired and apathetic. These factors all added up to a decisive defeat of the coalition, which won only 19 seats–including only seven for United–to Labour&#x27;s 53. Michael Joseph Savage became New Zealand&#x27;s first Labour Prime Minister.

==Merger==
United and Reform maintained their coalition while in opposition. In 1936 they decided to make the coalition permanent and to merge United and Reform into a single party. The new organisation took the name of &quot;the National Party&quot;, and – along with Labour – became one of New Zealand&#x27;s two dominant political parties from that point on.

<doc id="536679" wikidata="Q17055270" url="?curid=536679" title="1996 New Zealand general election">
<text>The 1996 New Zealand general election was held on 12 October 1996 to determine the composition of the 45th New Zealand Parliament. It was significant for being the first election to be held under the new mixed-member proportional (MMP) electoral system, and produced a parliament considerably more diverse than previous elections. Under the new MMP system, 65 members were elected in single-member districts by first-past-the-post voting (including five Māori electorates), while a further 55 &quot;top-up&quot; members were allocated from closed lists to achieve a proportional distribution based on each party&#x27;s share of the nationwide party vote.

1996 saw the National Party, led by Jim Bolger, retain its position in government, but only after protracted negotiations with the smaller New Zealand First party to form a coalition. New Zealand First won 17 seats—including sweeping every single Māori electorate, all of which had been dominated by the Labour Party since the Second World War. Particular emphasis was placed on New Zealand First&#x27;s unprecedented success, particularly among Māori; their five Māori electorate winners became known as the &quot;Tight Five&quot;. The party&#x27;s position as &quot;kingmaker&quot; meant they were able to place either of the two major parties into government, a significant election outcome for such a new party.

Various other unusual results occurred under the new system. For one, the National Party sought to ensure the parliamentary representation of the ACT New Zealand, a newly-formed libertarian party which had largely split from the Labour Party after the end of Rogernomics. National endorsed ACT leader and former Labour minister Richard Prebble against their own for Wellington Central, a consistently safe Labour seat. Under New Zealand&#x27;s MMP rules, a party qualified for list seats if it won at least one electorate seat, regardless of vote share. Bolger thus wanted to ensure ACT could potentially be part of a National-led coalition. Prebble unexpectedly won, though ACT&#x27;s vote share would have qualified them for MMP in any event. Other unusual occurrences was the large amount of new Māori MPs – leading to the backronym &quot;More Māori in Parliament&quot; for MMP. With the introduction of MMP in 1996, the proportion of Māori in Parliament increased from 8% to 14%, to an all-time record of 17 MPs.

==Background==

===Changes mid-term===
In the 1993 election, the National Party and the Labour Party had won 50 and 45 seats, respectively. The Alliance and the New Zealand First party had each won two seats. In the approach to MMP, however, there had been considerable rearrangement in parliament, with three new parties being established. As such, the situation just before the 1996 election was markedly different from the situation that had been established at the 1993 election.

===Electoral redistribution===
The 1996 election was notable for the significant change of electorate boundaries, based on the provisions of the Electoral Act 1993. Because of the introduction of the MMP electoral system, the number of electorates had to be reduced, leading to significant changes. Under MMP, there would be only 65 district members, down by 34 from the number elected in the 1993 election.

Many electorates were abolished, with their territories being incorporated into completely new electoral districts. More than half of the electorates contested in 1996 were newly constituted, and most of the remainder had seen significant boundary changes. &quot;Wanganui&quot; was renamed as &quot;Whanganui&quot;. In total, 73 electorates were abolished, 29 electorates were newly created, and 10 electorates were recreated, giving a net loss of 34 electorates.

;South Island
Since the 1967 electoral redistribution, the South Island had its number of general electorates fixed at 25. For the 1996 election and onwards, the number of South Island electorates is fixed at 16. The number of electors on the general roll of the South Island divided by 16 gives the target size for North Island and Māori electorates; this is referred to as the South Island quota.

The electorates of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and were abolished in the South Island. Six existing electorates (, , , , , and ) were kept. Seven electorates (, , , , , , and ) were newly formed. Three electorates (, , and ) were recreated.

;North Island
Based on the calculation described above, the target size for North Island electorates resulted in 44 of them being required.

The electorates of , , , , , , , , , , Hauraki, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and were abolished in the North Island. Twenty existing electorates (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ) were kept. Seventeen electorates (, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ) were newly formed. Eight electorates (, , , , , , and ) were recreated.

;Māori electorates
All four existing Māori electorates (, , , and ) were abolished. The calculation described above resulted in five Māori electorates being required; these were , , , , and .

;List seats
The House of Representatives was to have 120 seats, of which 65 were filled through electorate MPs (16 from South Island electorates, 44 from North Island electorates, and 5 from Māori electorates). This left 55 list seats to be filled. An outcome of the election was that no overhang seats were required.

===MPs retiring in 1996===
Eleven MPs intended to retire at the end of the 44th Parliament.

==The election==
The date of the 1996 election was 12 October; it was brought forward slightly to avoid the need for a by-election following the resignation of Michael Laws, as a by-election is not needed if there will be a general election within 6 months of a seat being vacated.

Of the 2,418,587 people registered to vote, 88.3% turned out to vote. The turnout was a slight improvement on the previous two elections, but still slightly lower than what would have been expected during the 1980s. The number of seats being contested was 120, an increase of 21 from the previous election, but as 55 of the new seats were for list candidates, the number of electorates was reduced considerably and many electorates had their boundaries amended or were abolished. While the number of general electorates decreased from 95 (1993) to 60 (1996), the number of Māori electorates increased from 4 to 5.

In the election 842 candidates stood, and there were 21 registered parties with party lists. Of the candidates, 459 were electorate and list, 152 were electorate only, and 231 were list only. 73% of candidates (616) were male and 27% (226) female.

==Summary of results==
The 1996 election eventually saw a victory for the governing National Party, which won around a third of the vote. The opposition Labour Party won slightly less. The election, however, was not decided by the comparative strengths of the major parties – rather, the smaller New Zealand First party, which won 17 seats, including 5 Māori seats won by the &quot;Tight Five&quot;, and was placed in the position of &quot;kingmaker&quot;, able to provide the necessary majority to whichever side it chose. Although predicted by many to ally with Labour, on 10 December 1996 New Zealand First leader Winston Peters chose to form a coalition with National, thus preserving Prime Minister Jim Bolger&#x27;s administration.

The 1996 election effectively showcased the difference made by the new electoral system. The Alliance and New Zealand First, both of which held two seats each in the old parliament, increased their representation to 13 and 17 seats, respectively, as a result of the change. The new ACT New Zealand also benefited, taking eight seats. The new United New Zealand party however was virtually wiped out, retaining only a single seat. The Conservative Party also only established only in previous Parliament by defecting Members of Parliament fared even worse, failing to remain in parliament at all. Strategic voting took place for the first time in a New Zealand MMP election in the Wellington seats of Ohariu-Belmont and Wellington Central.

However, Labour did manage to retain its status as among the top-two parties, as polls in the 1993–1996 period had shown Labour was in danger of being overtaken by the Alliance or New Zealand First. Labour&#x27;s success was credited largely to its leader Helen Clark being seen as having convincingly won the election debates and running a strong campaign on health, education and social services, while Bolger was said to have run a lackluster campaign.

Also notable in the 1996 election campaign was the Christian Coalition, an alliance of the Christian Democrats and the Christian Heritage Party. Although the party had briefly crossed the 5% threshold in some polls, it gained only 4.33% at the election, and therefore did not qualify for parliamentary representation. With the exception of the Maori Ratana movement, this is the closest that an overtly religious party has come to winning representation in parliament.

Voters were prepared with MMP to vote for minor party candidates with their electorate vote, hence in a number of electorates won by National or Labour the other major party candidate came third or even fourth; previously the two top polling candidates were almost always National and Labour.

In addition to the registered parties listed above, a number of unregistered parties also contested the election. Being unregistered, they could not submit party lists (and thus receive party votes), but they could still stand candidates in individual electorates. Among the parties to do this were the Indigenous Peoples Party, the New Zealand Progressive Party (unrelated to the 2002–2012 party of the same name) and the Nga Iwi Morehu Movement. Most unregistered parties stood only a single candidate, with only four parties running in multiple electorates. In total, around 1,500 people voted for candidates from unregistered parties. In addition, 26 independents contested electorate seats. A total of 16,436 people voted for independent candidates. No candidate from an unregistered party or an independent candidate won an electorate seat.

===Votes summary===


===Electorate results===
No party managed to win a straight majority of the 65 electorates. The National Party, the governing party, was three seats short of a majority, gaining 30 seats. The Labour Party, in opposition, won 26 electorate seats. New Zealand First won six electorate seats, the highest number of any minor party for over 50 years.

The Alliance, ACT and United managed to win one electorate seat each. For United, this was a significant loss – established by break-away MPs from National and Labour, the party entered the election with seven seats, but only Peter Dunne managed to retain his position, being helped by National&#x27;s decision not to field a candidate in his electorate of .

For the most part, traditional patterns prevailed when it came to the distribution of electorates – National performed best in rural areas, while Labour was strongest in the cities. A very significant departure from traditional patterns, however, was New Zealand First&#x27;s capture of all five Maori seats, which had traditionally been Labour strongholds. Although Labour was to reclaim these seats in the subsequent election, Labour&#x27;s monopoly was no longer so secure as it had been.

The table below shows the results of the 1996 general election:

<doc id="536683" wikidata="Q96036383" url="?curid=536683" title="Anglo-Americans">
<text>Anglo-Americans are a demographic group in Anglo-America. It typically refers to the predominantly European-descent nations and ethnic groups in the Americas that speak English as a native language, making up the majority of people in the world who speak English as a first language.

== Usage ==
The term is ambiguous and used in several different ways. While it is primarily used to refer to people of English ancestry, it (along with terms like &quot;Anglo&quot;, &quot;Anglic&quot;, &quot;Anglophone&quot;, and &quot;Anglophonic&quot;) is also used to denote all people of British or Northwestern European ancestry. It can include all people of Northwestern European ethnic origin who speak English as a mother tongue and their descendants in the New World.

== Culture ==
The term implies a relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom (specifically England), or the two countries&#x27; shared language, English, and/or cultural heritage. In this context the term may refer to an English American, a person from the United States whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in England, a person from the United States who speaks English as their first language (see American English), a collective term referring to those countries that have similar legal systems based on common law, relations between the United Kingdom and United States, or Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, a national cataloging code.

The term is also used, less frequently, to denote a connection between English people (or the English language) and the Western Hemisphere as a whole. In this context, the term can mean a person from the Americas whose ancestry originates from any English speaking country (see British diaspora) or a person from the Americas who has an English name and speaks English as their first language (see English-speaking world and Languages of the Americas), or a person from Anglo-America.

== Adjective ==
The adjective Anglo-American is used in the following ways:
* to denote the cultural sphere shared by the United Kingdom, the United States and English Canada. For example, &quot;Anglo-American culture is different from French culture.&quot; Political leaders including Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan have used the term to discuss the &quot;Special Relationship&quot; between Britain and America.
* to describe relations between Britain and the United States. For example, &quot;Anglo-American relations became more relaxed after the War of 1812.&quot;

<doc id="536691" wikidata="Q1702113" url="?curid=536691" title="John Watts (New York politician)">
<text>John Watts Jr. (August 27, 1749 – September 3, 1836) was an American lawyer and politician from New York City who represented New York in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Life==

John Watts was born on August 27, 1749, in New York City. He was the son of John Watts (1715–1789), a Scottish immigrant from a wealthy family, and Ann DeLancey (1723–1784), a descendant of the Schuyler family and Van Cortlandt family. His elder brother, Robert Watts (1743–1814), was married to Mary Alexander, the daughter of Lord Stirling. His younger siblings included Anne Watts (1744–1783), who was married to Archibald Kennedy, 11th Earl of Cassilis (the parents of Archibald Kennedy, 1st Marquess of Ailsa), Susannah Watts (1749–1823), who was married to Phillip Kearney, Mary Nicoll Watts (1751–1815), who was married to Sir John Johnson, 2nd Baronet, Stephen Watts, who was married to Sarah Nugent, and Margaret Watts, who was married to Robert Leake.

His maternal grandparents were the French born Etienne de Lancy (1663–1741), a minor member of the French nobility, and Anne van Cortlandt (1676–1724), the third child of Gertrude Schuyler (b. 1654) and Stephanus van Cortlandt (1643–1700), the Chief Justice of the Province of New York.

He completed preparatory studies, graduated with an A.M. degree from King&#x27;s College in May 1769, and studied law.

==Career==
In 1774, he was appointed the Recorder of New York City under Mayor David Mathews, and was the last to serve in this role under the English Crown. The role included serving as a &quot;mayoral assistant, judge, and in sundry administrative and judicial functions.&quot;

His father, a Loyalist, fled the colonies to England during the Revolutionary War. In 1779, his properties, including his &quot;Rose Hill&quot; estate (which is now occupied by Fordham University), were seized by the New York State Legislature. Watts and his brother Robert petitioned for the attainder to be overturned. They were unable to have it overturned but were allowed to buy back their father&#x27;s properties.

===Post Revolutionary War===
From 1788 to 1789 and again from 1791 to 1793, Watts was a member of the New York State Assembly serving as Speaker of the Assembly from 1791 to 1793. He was a member of the commission to build Newgate Prison in New York City, in use between 1797 and 1829.

In 1793, he was elected as a Pro-Administration Party representative to the 3rd United States Congress succeeding John Laurance to represent New York&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. He served in the U.S. Congress from March 4, 1793, until March 3, 1795. He was defeated in his run for re-election by Edward Livingston.

He was a judge of Westchester County, New York from 1802 to 1807. He was also a member of Westchester Masonic Lodge No. 46 (now Huguenot Masonic Lodge No.46).

===Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum===
In 1831, Watts organized the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum after his friend (who was also his sister Margaret&#x27;s brother-in-law), John George Leake (1752–1827), died with no children or living siblings. Leake and Watts Services is now called Rising Ground. Leakes had left his personal property (valued at about $300,000) and real estate (worth an additional $86,000), to Watts&#x27; son provided he change his name to &quot;Robert Leake.&quot; While Watts son made the change, he died a few months later, leaving no will. The real estate was escheated to the State because of technical problems of the &quot;will&quot;, however, the personal property passed to Watts who used it to found the Orphan Asylum.

==Personal life==
In 1775, Watts married Jane Delancey (1750–1809) in a double wedding, along with her sister, Susannah Delancey (1754–1837), who married Thomas Henry Barclay. The sisters were daughters of Peter DeLancey (who served in the New York Provincial Assembly for many years) and Elizabeth Colden (daughter of Cadwallader Colden), and granddaughters of Stephen Delancey making them first cousins to John.

Together, John and Jane were the parents of eleven children. His grandson would later write that &quot;Watts was a monument of affliction, in that he had seen his wife, six handsome, gifted, and gallant sons, and four daughters precede him to the grave. One childless daughter survived him and three grandchildren.&quot; The children included:

* George Watts, a First Lt. and aide-de-camp to General Winfield Scott from 1814 to 1815.
* Robert J. Watts, a captain in the 41st Infantry to whom John G. Leake left his extensive properties. Robert inherited Leake&#x27;s estate but died very soon after.
* John Watts III.
* Ann Watts.
* Susan Watts (1795–1823), who married her cousin Philip Kearny (1780–1849).
* Elizabeth Watts (d. 1866), who married Henry Laight.
* Mary Justina Watts (1801–1821), who married Frederic de Peyster (1796–1882) in 1820.

John Watts died at his longtime home, 3 Broadway in New York City, on September 3, 1836. He was interred in a vault in Trinity Churchyard. In 1839, his family&#x27;s Rose Hill estate and manor house were purchased by the Catholic Church to establish St. John&#x27;s College.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Susan, he was the grandfather of Gen. Philip Kearny (1815–1862), a United States Army officer notable for his leadership in the Mexican–American War and American Civil War who was killed in action in the 1862 Battle of Chantilly. He was interred in Watts&#x27;s vault until being removed to Arlington National Cemetery.

Through his daughter Mary, he was the grandfather of John Watts de Peyster (1821–1907), a New York City author and philanthropist who married Estelle Livingston (1819–1898) in 1841.

<doc id="536694" wikidata="Q5255518" url="?curid=536694" title="Democracy for America">
<text>Democracy for America (DFA) was a progressive political action committee headquartered in Burlington, Vermont. Founded by former Democratic National Committee Chair Howard Dean in 2004, DFA led public awareness campaigns on a variety of public policy issues, trains activists, and provided funding directly to candidates for office, until it ended operations in 2022. At its peak, the organization had dozens of local chapters and more than a million members in the United States and internationally.

== History ==

=== Foundation and early history (2001–2004) ===
Dean created the PAC Fund for a Healthy America in 2001 in Montpelier in advance of a planned campaign for president. In March 2004, following the conclusion of Dean&#x27;s presidential campaign, the organization was renamed &quot;Democracy for America.&quot;

Following his unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Dean used the organization to build on the grassroots momentum for Democratic candidates around the country and for his successful campaign to become chair of the Democratic National Committee. DFA used the Internet-based, grassroots organizing that Dean had created for his presidential campaign to help like-minded Democrats get elected. In 2004 the organization endorsed and supported Democrats (known as the Dean Dozen) on the federal, state, and county levels.

=== 2005–2022 ===
In 2005, Dean turned over control of the organization to his brother, Jim Dean, when he became DNC Chair. Since then, Democracy for America has helped elect over 600 progressives into office, including President Barack Obama, while building their membership to over a million like-minded progressives across all fifty states. In 2007, DFA became the first carbon-neutral political action committee in the United States.

Arshad Hasan served as executive director from 2007 to 2013, after which Charles R. Chamberlain became executive director. Effective January 1, 2019, Chamberlain was named chair, while Yvette Simpson was named chief executive. Fundraising efforts collapsed under Simpson. In December 2022, Simpson announced she would step down from the organization, which was no longer solvent and was dissolved. The associated 501(c)4, Democracy for America Advocacy Fund, also known as DFA Advocacy Fund, continued limited operations. 

== DFA-List ==

DFA focused on endorsing candidates at all levels of office, both local and national. DFA&#x27;s endorsements were often orchestrated by members of local groups, and they provided resources, such as funds and addresses, to the endorsed campaign. According to their records, the group endorsed over 578 candidates. Candidates wishing for an endorsement may apply on the organization&#x27;s website.

DFA initially endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential race after earning a record-breaking 87.9% of the vote in their online poll.

The organization switched its endorsement in July 2016 &quot;...to stand with Bernie Sanders by joining him in formally endorsing Hillary Clinton for President.&quot; Sanders has since formed his own group Our Revolution.

Notable past DFA endorsements have included:

*Keith Ellison for DNC Chair in the 2017 election
*Bernie Sanders for U.S. Senate in Vermont and U.S. President
*Barack Obama for U.S. Senate in Illinois and U.S. President
*Julie Gunnigle for Maricopa County Attorney
*Al Franken for U.S. Senate in Minnesota
*Misty K. Snow for U.S. Senate in Utah
*Mark Begich for U.S. Senate in Alaska
*Ned Lamont for U.S. Senate in Connecticut
*Jeff Merkley for U.S. Senate in Oregon
*Elizabeth Warren for U.S. Senate in Massachusetts
*Howard Dean for DNC Chair
*Deval Patrick for Governor of Massachusetts
*Jon Tester for U.S. Senate in Montana
*Sheldon Whitehouse for U.S. Senate in Rhode Island
*Martin Heinrich for U.S. Representative for New Mexico&#x27;s 1st district
*Joey Novick for mayor of Flemington, New Jersey
*Sam Yoon for Boston City Council
*Jerry McNerney for U.S. Representative from California&#x27;s 11th District
*Jack Markell for Governor of Delaware
*Linda McCulloch for Montana Secretary of State
*Debra Bowen for California Secretary of State
*Denise Juneau for Montana Superintendent of Public Instruction
*Donna Edwards for U.S. Representative in Maryland from Maryland&#x27;s 4th district
*Jim Himes for U.S. Representative for Connecticut&#x27;s 4th district
*Alan Grayson for U.S. Representative in Florida from Florida&#x27;s 8th district
*Paulette Jordan for Governor of Idaho in 2018

== Political positions ==
Democracy for America&#x27;s status on various social and economic issues places the organization strongly on the left of the American political spectrum. Although they often endorse and advocate for Democratic Party candidates, DFA is also to the left of many national and state Democratic lawmakers.

In 2006, the group supported Ned Lamont over Sen. Joseph Lieberman in Connecticut&#x27;s primary and general elections. DFA also supported Carol Shea-Porter in her Democratic primary and general election victory in New Hampshire&#x27;s 1st congressional district. In 2008, the group supported Donna Edwards of Maryland&#x27;s 4th congressional district.

During the 2008 Minnesota Senate election between Norm Coleman and Al Franken, Democracy for America aligned themselves with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and called their campaign &quot;Donate a Dollar a Day to Make Norm Go Away.&quot; Coleman lost to Franken following an official state-wide recount.

=== Domestic issues ===
Before creating this PAC, the group&#x27;s founder, Howard Dean, who already possessed a considerable platform, had strongly campaigned in favor of universal health care. Therefore, the DFA&#x27;s first major campaign after the 2008 presidential election focused mainly on this issue, standing in support of universal healthcare.

In 2011, DFA&#x27;s main issue of interest was the rights of company employees, which was campaigned for, among other things, by promoting unions. DFA, Progressive Change Campaign Committee (or PCCC), and several other organizations with lesser contribution levels, combined funds to spend $2.2 million canvassing about these issues, including phone calls, door-to-door campaigning, and TV ads.

DFA has also campaigned to oppose legislation that requires voters to present government-issued identification cards, birth certificates, or passports before voting. The organization has at various times deemed the laws &quot;excessive&quot; and &quot;Draconian,&quot; and has argued that the laws inhibit ordinary citizens from being able to enter the polling stations.

Additionally, DFA&#x27;s Advocacy Fund has cosponsored a digital sign-on action for universal Pre-K alongside Democratic Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici and a number of other groups, including Saphron Initiative and Daily Kos.

Furthermore, the DFA campaigns on behalf of legislation to benefit homosexual Americans, to guard the rights afforded to them through the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States. The organization sent volunteers to Maine to campaign against 2009 Maine Question 1, which nullified a same-sex marriage law passed by the state&#x27;s legislature. In a related issue, DFA pushed for the repeal of the &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; laws in regard to the U.S. military.

DFA has also run anti-Wall Street campaigns and a &quot;Boycott BP&quot; campaign in response to a leaky oil pipe in the Gulf of Mexico that was owned by BP.

=== Foreign policy issues ===
Democracy for America supported the withdrawal of the United States from the Iraq War.

=== Endorsed presidential candidates ===
In 2008, Democracy for America endorsed Barack Obama, who was then an outspoken critic of the Iraq War. In February 2009, President Obama stated unequivocally that American occupation in Iraq will end no later than August 31, 2010. DFA did not withdraw its support for Obama after he failed to do this.

In 2016, DFA endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 United States presidential election, in accordance with the results of a poll of their supporters conducted on the DFA website.

In 2020, DFA endorsed Bernie Sanders, also in accordance with a website poll.

== Training and scholarships ==
DFA members at both the national and local levels have participated in numerous training programs, intended to instruct prospective candidates on running a successful political campaign. DFA&#x27;s main training initiative, called the &quot;Campaign Academy&quot;, consists of 16 hours of interactive workshops that bring hundreds of local activists, campaign staff, and candidates together for 2 days of intensive campaign training. Topics have included; online organizing, shutting down a campaign, canvassing, phone banking, recruiting volunteers, how to increase voter turnout, developing a finance plan, sustaining your media presence, winning with social networks and building a grassroots army: volunteer recruitment.

&quot;DFA Night School&quot; is the organization&#x27;s online training program. Each session is an hour-long interactive conference call and web presentation where trainees participate and ask questions.

=== Netroots Nation Scholarship competition ===
DFA also awards scholarships to progressive or liberal bloggers, known as the &quot;Netroots Nation Scholarship.&quot; In 2010, DFA sent 60 online activists to Netroots Nation, held in Las Vegas, NV, from July 22–25. Other sites for the Netroots Nation Convention have included Austin, Texas, in 2008 and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 2009.

== Dean Corps ==
In 2010, DFA sent field organizers to progressive campaigns for a program called Dean Corps. Similar to Russ Feingold&#x27;s Progressive Patriot Corps, organizers represented an in-kind contribution to the recipient campaign. The goal is to hire, train and place field organizers on key progressive campaigns to get more progressive Democrats elected.

<doc id="536695" wikidata="Q26849" url="?curid=536695" title="Vienne, Isère">
<text>Vienne (; ) is a town in southeastern France, located south of Lyon, at the confluence of the Gère and the Rhône. It is the fourth-largest commune in the Isère department, of which it is a subprefecture alongside La Tour-du-Pin. Vienne was a major centre of the Roman Empire under the Latin name &quot;Vienna&quot;.

Vienne was the capital of the Allobroges, a Gallic people, before its conquest by the Romans. Transformed into a Roman colony in 47 BC under Julius Caesar, It became a major urban centre, ideally located along the Rhône, then a major axis of communication. Emperor Augustus banished Herod the Great&#x27;s son, the ethnarch Herod Archelaus to Vienne in 6 AD.

As a Roman provincial capital, remains of Roman constructions are widespread across modern Vienne. The city was also an important early bishopric in Christian Gaul. Its most famous bishop was Avitus of Vienne. At the Council of Vienne, which was convened there in October 1311, Pope Clement V abolished the order of the Knights Templar. During the Middle Ages, Vienne was part of the Kingdom of Provence, part of the Holy Roman Empire; on the opposite bank of the Rhône was Kingdom of France, which made the city strategically important.

The town is now a regional commercial and industrial centre, known regionally for its Saturday market. A Roman temple, circus pyramid and theatre (where the annual Jazz à Vienne is held), as well as museums (archaeological, textile industry) and notable Catholic buildings, make tourism an important part of the town&#x27;s economy.

==History==
===Roman Vienne===
The &quot;oppidum&quot; of the Allobroges became a Roman colony about 47 BC under Julius Caesar, but the Allobroges managed to expel the Romans; the exiles then founded the colony of &quot;Lugdunum&quot; (today&#x27;s Lyon). Herod Archelaus, the Ethnarch of Judea, was exiled here in 6 AD. During the early Empire, &quot;Vienna&quot; (as the Romans called it—not to be confused with today&#x27;s Vienna, then known as Vindobona) regained all its former privileges as a Roman colony. In 260 Postumus was proclaimed Emperor here of a short-lived Gallo-Roman Empire. Later it became a provincial capital of the Dioecesis Viennensis.

Vienne became the seat of the vicar of prefects after the creation of regional dioceses, of which the date is still controversial. Regional dioceses were created during the First Tetrarchy, 293–305, or possibly later as some recent studies suggest in 313, but no later than the Verona List, which is securely dated to June 314.

On the bank of the Gère are traces of the ramparts of the old Roman city, and on Mont Pipet (east of the town) are the remains of a Roman theatre, while the thirteenth-century castle built on Mont Salomon on the orders of Archbishop is said to have been built on the site of a former Roman fort. Several ancient aqueducts remain in the Gère valley and parts of Roman roads are preserved (in particular in the city park).

Two important Roman monuments still stand at Vienne. One is the Early Imperial Temple of Augustus and Livia, a rectangular peripteral building of the Corinthian order, erected by the emperor Claudius, which owes its survival, like the Maison Carrée at Nîmes, to being converted to a church soon after the Theodosian decrees and later rededicated as &quot;Notre Dame de Vie&quot;. During the Revolutionary Reign of Terror it was used for the local Festival of Reason. The other is the &quot;Plan de l&#x27;Aiguille&quot;, a truncated pyramid resting on a portico with four arches, from the Roman circus. Legends from the 13th century mention Pontius Pilate&#x27;s death in Vienne. Later legends held that the pyramid was either the tomb of Herod Archelaus or of Pontius Pilate.

The vestiges of a temple to Cybèle were discovered in 1945 when a new hospital was built on Mount Salomon and the Ancien Hôpital in the center of town was torn down. Subsequent archaeological research conducted in 1965 permitted detailed reconstruction of the floor plan for the temple as well as the surrounding forum and established that the temple was constructed in the first century AD.

===Christian Vienne===
The provincial capital was an important early seat of a bishop and the legendary first bishop is said to have been Crescens, a disciple of Paul. There were Christians here in 177 when the churches of Vienne and Lyon addressed a letter to those of Asia and Phrygia, and mention is made of Sanctus, a deacon of Vienne (Eusebius of Caesarea, &quot;Church History&quot;). The first historical bishop was Verus, who was present at the Council of Arles (314). About 450, Vienne&#x27;s bishops became archbishops, several of whom played an important cultural role, e.g. Mamertus, who established Rogation pilgrimages, and the poet, Avitus (498–518). Vienne&#x27;s archbishops and those of Lyon disputed the title of &quot;Primate of All the Gauls&quot; based on the dates of founding of the cities compared to the dates of founding of the bishoprics. Vienne&#x27;s archbishopric was suppressed in 1790, during the French Revolution and officially terminated 11 years later by the Concordat of 1801.

===Burgundian Vienne===
Vienne was a target during the Migration Period: it was taken by the Kingdom of the Burgundians in 438, but re-taken by the Romans and held until 461. In 534 the Merovingian-led Franks captured Vienne. It was then sacked by the Lombards in 558, and later by the Moors in 737. When Francia&#x27;s king divided Frankish Burgundia into three parts in 843 by the Treaty of Verdun, Vienne became part of Middle Francia.

===In the Kingdom of Provence===
King Charles II the Bald assigned the Viennois district in 869 to Comte Boso of Provence, who in 879 proclaimed himself king of Provence and on his death in 887 was buried at Vienne in the cathedral church of St. Maurice. Vienne then continued as capital of the &quot;Dauphiné Vienne&quot; of the Kingdom of Provence, from 882 of the Kingdom of West Francia and from 933 of the Kingdom of Burgundy until in 1032, when it reverted to the Holy Roman Empire, but the real rulers were the archbishops of Vienne. Their rights were repeatedly recognized, but they had serious local rivals in the counts of Albon and the dauphins of Viennois. In 1349, Humbert II sold his rights to the Dauphiné to France, but the archbishop stood firm and Vienne was not included in this sale.

Gui de Bourgogne, who was archbishop from 1090 to 1119, was elected pope in 1119 and served as Callixtus II until his death in 1124.

===Medieval period, Reformation, Renaissance===
Jean de Bernin drew up a municipal charter (&quot;charte des franchises&quot;) for Vienne around 1225 (including provisions for a town council). Nevertheless, it was only in the fifteenth century that the coat of arms (Vienna civitas sancta) with an elm tree is attested (based on a tree uprooted around 1430 from near Saint-André-le-bas).

The Council of Vienne was the fifteenth Ecumenical Council of the Roman Catholic Church that met between 1311 and 1312 in Vienne. Its principal act was to withdraw papal support for the Knights Templar on the instigation of Philip IV of France.

The archbishops gave up their territorial powers over Vienne to the French king in 1449. Between 1482 and 1527, French kings appointed four Italians as archbishop of Vienne in succession, beginning with , a doctor and astrologer. The last of these, Scaramuccia Trivulzio, died in Rome before he could take possession of the archbishopric, which allowed for the confirmation of , elected by the canons of Saint-Maurice in an act of resistance to the royal practice of appointing foreign prelates. At this time, there was no shortage of priests: a 1551 consular document indicated that over 5000 masses were celebrated each year in Vienne.

As a result of a 1540 printers&#x27; strike in Lyon, Michael Servetus&#x27; publisher moved to Vienne, where Pierre Palmier had invited his former teacher to come live. From 1541, Servetus worked as a doctor in the town, where he was known as Michel de Villeneuve, but also participated in decisions related to town infrastructure (rebuilding the Saint-Sévère bridge over the Gère after the 13 October 1544 flood). In January 1553 his &quot;Christianismi Restitutio&quot; was published anonymously in Vienne in a clandestine workshop, after being refused by a publisher in Basel. Jean Frellon, a Lyon bookseller, sent a copy to the theologian John Calvin, because Servetus had included his correspondence with Calvin in the book. Calvin, who viewed Servetus as a delirious braggart, insinuated dire consequences should Servetus come to Geneva. In the book, Servetus was also critical of the Pope and the Roman church, particularly of the doctrine of the Trinity and of child baptism. By order of Cardinal François de Tournon and Archbishop Palmier, he was arrested on 5 April 1553. Questioned for the next two days by the inquisitor Matthieu Ory, among others, he denied that he was Servetus, saying he had usurped the name for his correspondence with Calvin. On the morning of the third day, he managed to escape from the prison due to the special privileges accorded him by the bailliff. Ory recommended that he be found guilty of heresy, which was done on 17 June, when he was condemned to be burned at the stake, along with his books, in a then-undeveloped area of the Saint-Martin neighbourhood.

Vienne was sacked in 1562 by the Protestants under the baron des Adrets, and was held by the Catholic League from 1590 until 1595, when it was taken in the name of King Henry IV by Henri de Montmorency. The fortifications were demolished between 1589 and 1636.

===Industrial era===
Train stations were built in Vienne in 1855 and in Estressin in 1875 providing freight transport to the textile and metallurgy industries, which took advantage of the water power in the Gère valley.

In 1875, the State signed a contract with Vienne for the establishment of a cavalry regiment, necessitating the construction of a barracks from 1882 to 1886 in what became known as the Quartier Saint-Germain in 1887. When the last military regiment was disbanded in 1990, the former barracks was transformed into a business center, with some of the buildings conserved, such as the riding academy, which became a concert hall in 2018.

==Monuments==

The two outstanding Roman remains in Vienne are the temple of Augustus and Livia, and the &quot;Plan de l&#x27;Aiguille&quot; or &quot;Pyramide&quot;, a truncated pyramid resting on a portico with four arches, which was associated with the city&#x27;s Roman circus.

The early Romanesque church of Saint Peter belonged to an ancient Benedictine abbey and was rebuilt in the ninth century, with tall square piers and two ranges of windows in the tall aisles and a notable porch. It is one of France&#x27;s oldest Christian buildings dating from the 5th century laid-out in the form of a basilica and having a large and well constructed nave. It also has a Romanesque tower and a sculptured South portal containing a statue of Saint Peter. Today, the building houses a lapidary museum that holds a Junon head and a statue of Tutela, the city&#x27;s protective divinity.

The Gothic former cathedral of St Maurice was built between 1052 and 1533. It is a basilica, with three aisles and an apse, but no ambulatory or transepts. It is in length, wide and in height. The most striking portion is the west front, which rises majestically from a terrace overhanging the Rhône. Its sculptural decoration was badly damaged by the Protestants in 1562 during the Wars of Religion.

The Romanesque church of St André en Bas was the church of a second Benedictine monastery, and became the chapel of the earlier kings of Provence. It was rebuilt in 1152, in the later Romanesque style.

The Monument aux Morts in front of the train station is the work of Claude Grange and was inaugurated in 1923 by Philippe Pétain.

<doc id="536697" wikidata="Q4825885" url="?curid=536697" title="Authentication protocol">
<text>An authentication protocol is a type of computer communications protocol or cryptographic protocol specifically designed for transfer of authentication data between two entities. It allows the receiving entity to authenticate the connecting entity (e.g. Client connecting to a Server) as well as authenticate itself to the connecting entity (Server to a client) by declaring the type of information needed for authentication as well as syntax. It is the most important layer of protection needed for secure communication within computer networks.

==Purpose ==

With the increasing amount of trustworthy information being accessible over the network, the need for keeping unauthorized persons from access to this data emerged. Stealing someone&#x27;s identity is easy in the computing world - special verification methods had to be invented to find out whether the person/computer requesting data is really who he says he is. The task of the authentication protocol is to specify the exact series of steps needed for execution of the authentication. It has to comply with the main protocol principles:
# A Protocol has to involve two or more parties and everyone involved in the protocol must know the protocol in advance.
# All the included parties have to follow the protocol.
# A protocol has to be unambiguous - each step must be defined precisely.
# A protocol must be complete - must include a specified action for every possible situation.
An illustration of password-based authentication using simple authentication protocol:

Alice (an entity wishing to be verified) and Bob (an entity verifying Alice&#x27;s identity) are both aware of the protocol they agreed on using. Bob has Alice&#x27;s password stored in a database for comparison. 
# Alice sends Bob her password in a packet complying with the protocol rules.
# Bob checks the received password against the one stored in his database. Then he sends a packet saying &quot;Authentication successful&quot; or &quot;Authentication failed&quot; based on the result.
This is an example of a very basic authentication protocol vulnerable to many threats such as eavesdropping, replay attack, man-in-the-middle attacks, dictionary attacks or brute-force attacks. Most authentication protocols are more complicated in order to be resilient against these attacks.

==Types==

===Authentication protocols developed for PPP Point-to-Point Protocol===
Protocols are used mainly by Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) servers to validate the identity of remote clients before granting them access to server data. Most of them use a password as the cornerstone of the authentication. In most cases, the password has to be shared between the communicating entities in advance.
====PAP - Password Authentication Protocol====
Password Authentication Protocol is one of the oldest authentication protocols. Authentication is initialized by the client sending a packet with credentials (username and password) at the beginning of the connection, with the client repeating the authentication request until acknowledgement is received. It is highly insecure because credentials are sent &quot;in the clear&quot; and repeatedly, making it vulnerable even to the most simple attacks like eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle based attacks. Although widely supported, it is specified that if an implementation offers a stronger authentication method, that method &quot;must&quot; be offered before PAP. Mixed authentication (e.g. the same client alternately using both PAP and CHAP) is also not expected, as the CHAP authentication would be compromised by PAP sending the password in plain-text.

====CHAP - Challenge-handshake authentication protocol====

The authentication process in this protocol is always initiated by the server/host and can be performed anytime during the session, even repeatedly. The server sends a random string (usually 128B long). The client uses the password and the string received as input to a hash function and then sends the result together with username in plain text. The server uses the username to apply the same function and compares the calculated and received hash. An authentication is successful when the calculated and received hashes match.

====EAP - Extensible Authentication Protocol====

EAP was originally developed for PPP(Point-to-Point Protocol) but today is widely used in IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.11(WiFi) or IEEE 802.16 as a part of IEEE 802.1x authentication framework. The latest version is standardized in RFC 5247. The advantage of EAP is that it is only a general authentication framework for client-server authentication - the specific way of authentication is defined in its many versions called EAP-methods. More than 40 EAP-methods exist, the most common are:
*EAP-MD5
*EAP-TLS
*EAP-TTLS
*EAP-FAST
*EAP-PEAP

===AAA architecture protocols (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)===

Complex protocols used in larger networks for verifying the user (Authentication), controlling access to server data (Authorization) and monitoring network resources and information needed for billing of services (Accounting).

====TACACS, XTACACS and TACACS+====
The oldest AAA protocol using IP based authentication without any encryption (usernames and passwords were transported as plain text). Later version XTACACS (Extended TACACS) added authorization and accounting. Both of these protocols were later replaced by TACACS+. TACACS+ separates the AAA components thus they can be segregated and handled on separate servers (It can even use another protocol for e.g. Authorization). It uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for transport and encrypts the whole packet. TACACS+ is Cisco proprietary.

====RADIUS====

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) is a full AAA protocol commonly used by ISPs. Credentials are mostly username-password combination based, and it uses NAS and UDP protocol for transport.

====DIAMETER====
Diameter (protocol) evolved from RADIUS and involves many improvements such as usage of more reliable TCP or SCTP transport protocol and higher security thanks to TLS.

===Other===
====Kerberos (protocol)====
Kerberos is a centralized network authentication system developed at MIT and available as a free implementation from MIT but also in many commercial products. It is the default authentication method in Windows 2000 and later. The authentication process itself is much more complicated than in the previous protocols - Kerberos uses symmetric key cryptography, requires a trusted third party and can use public-key cryptography during certain phases of authentication if need be.

==List of various other authentication protocols==
* AKA
* Basic access authentication
* CAVE-based authentication
* CRAM-MD5
* Digest
* Host Identity Protocol (HIP)
* LAN Manager
* NTLM, also known as NT LAN Manager
* OpenID protocol
* Password-authenticated key agreement protocols
* Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access (PANA)
* Secure Remote Password protocol (SRP)
* RFID-Authentication Protocols
* Woo Lam 92 (protocol)
* SAML

<doc id="536698" wikidata="Q1818899" url="?curid=536698" title="Settler">
<text>A settler is a person who establishes or joins a permanent presence that is separate to existing communities. The entity that a settler establishes is a settlement. A settler is called a pioneer if they are among the first settling at a place that is new to the settler community.

The process of settling land can be, and has often been, controversial: while human migration is a normal phenomenon by itself, it has not been uncommon throughout human history for settlers to have arrived in already-inhabited lands without the intention of living alongside the native population. In these cases, the conflict that arises between the settlers and the natives (or Indigenous peoples) may result in the dispossession of the latter within the contested territory, usually violently. While settlers can act independently, they may receive support from the government of their country or empire or from a non-governmental organization as part of a larger campaign. The lifestyle of a native population is often disturbed or destroyed if they come into contact with a settler population, particularly when the settler population seeks to mostly replace them, as well as leading to a change in culture (or alteration of the existing culture) and traditions and beliefs brought in by the settlers which was previously not present among the natives.

== Historical usage ==
Many times throughout history, settlers occupied land that was previously inhabited by long-established peoples, who are designated as native or Indigenous. Additional terms may be used to describe the Indigenous peoples of the Americas and Indigenous Australians, such as Aborigines, First Nations, or Native Americans. In the United States, the terms &quot;Indian&quot; and &quot;American Indian&quot; are still common, but controversial. In order to avoid confusion with actual Indians or Indian Americans (as the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus mistakenly believed that he had arrived in India when he discovered the Americas in the 15th century), the terms &quot;East Indian&quot; and &quot;Asian Indian&quot; are also used to differentiate Indians from the Indigenous peoples of the United States.

The process by which Indigenous territories are settled by foreign peoples is usually called settler colonialism. It relies upon a process of often violent dispossession.

In the figurative usage, a &quot;person who goes first or does something first&quot; also applies to the American English use of &quot;pioneer&quot; to refer to a settlera person who has migrated to a less occupied area and established permanent residence there, often to colonize the area; as first recorded in English in 1605. In United States history, it refers to the Europeans who were part of the process of settling new lands on Indigenous territories.

In this usage, pioneers are usually among the first to an area, whereas settlers can arrive after first settlement and join others in the process of human settlement. This correlates with the work of military pioneers, who were tasked with construction of camps before the main body of troops would arrive at the designated campsite.
The Russian Empire regularly invited Russian subjects and foreign nationals to settle in sparsely populated lands, mostly in North Asia, but also in Central Asia. These settlers were called colonists. These projects resulted in the inception of Slavo-Serbia, Volga Germans, Volhynia, and Russians in Kazakhstan, among other phenomena.

Although settlers in the early modern era frequently made use of sea routes—significant waves of settlement could also use long overland routes, such as the Great Trek by the Boer-Afrikaners in South Africa, or the Oregon Trail in the United States.

=== Anthropological usage ===
Anthropologists record the tribal displacement of native settlers who drive another tribe from the lands it held, such as the settlement of lands in the area now called Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, where the Ohlone people settled in areas that were previously inhabited by the Esselen people.

=== Modern usage ===
In Canada, the term &quot;settler&quot; is currently used to describe &quot;the non-Indigenous peoples living in Canada who form the European-descended sociopolitical majority&quot; and thereby asserting that settler colonialism is an ongoing phenomenon. The usage is controversial to some.

In the Middle East and North Africa, there are a number of references to various squatter and specific policies that are referred to as settler-oriented in nature. Among those:
* Turkiye – Since the Turkic invasion of Anatolia, There has been mass ethnic cleansing of locals such as in the Armenian genocide, Oppression of Kurds, and more.
* Iraq – The Ba&#x27;athist Arabization campaigns in northern Iraq, which began in 1968, resulted in the ethnic cleansing of non-Arabs, especially Kurds, who were then replaced by Arab settlers in a process that continued until the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
* Israel – large-scale immigration of Jews to Palestine began by 1882—namely to Jerusalem, Hebron, Tiberias, Safed, Jaffa, Haifa, Peki&#x27;in, Acre, Nablus, Shfaram, Petah Tikva and various other locations. By 1948, about 630,000 Jewish residents lived there, of which about 460,000 were immigrants. After the 1967 Arab–Israeli War and the Jewish exodus from the Muslim world, Jews from around the world began moving into the formerly restricted and Jordan-occupied West Bank and the formerly Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip. Since the Israeli Declaration of Independence in 1948, more than 3 million Jews have made aliyah (), that is the immigration of Jews from the diaspora to the geographical Land of Israel. However, the Israeli settlement is discussed in the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.
* Syria – In recent times, Arab settlers have also moved in large numbers to regions inhabited by Kurds and other ethnic minorities, such as northeast Syria.
* Cyprus – After the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, citizens of the Republic of Turkey began moving into the internationally unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Today, it is estimated that these Turkish settlers constitute around half of the population of occupied Cyprus.
* Morocco – Since the beginning of the Western Sahara conflict, citizens of the Kingdom of Morocco began moving into the Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara. The presence of these Moroccan settlers is contested by the partially recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, which claims all of Western Sahara as its sovereign territory.

== Causes of emigration ==
The reasons for the emigration of settlers vary, but often they include the following factors and incentives: the desire to start a new and better life in a foreign land, personal financial hardship, social, cultural, ethnic, or religious persecution (e.g., the Pilgrims and Mormons), penal deportation (e.g. of convicted criminals from England to Australia), political oppression, and government incentive policies aimed at encouraging foreign settlement.

<text>A trade association, also known as an industry trade group, business association, sector association or industry body, is an organization founded and funded by businesses that operate in a specific industry. Through collaboration between companies within a sector, a trade association coordinates public relations activities such as advertising, education, publishing and, especially, lobbying and political action. Associations may offer other services, such as producing conferences, setting industry standards, holding networking or charitable events, or offering classes or educational materials. Many associations are non-profit organizations governed by bylaws and directed by officers who are also members. (FEC: Solicitable Class of Trade Association, Library of Congress).

In countries with a social market economy, the role of trade associations is often taken by employers&#x27; organizations, which also take a role in social dialogue.

==Political influence==

One of the primary purposes of trade groups, particularly in the United States, is to attempt to influence public policy in a direction favorable to the group&#x27;s members. It can take the form of contributions to the campaigns of political candidates and parties through political action committees (PACs); contributions to &quot;issue&quot; campaigns not tied to a candidate or party; and lobbying legislators to support or oppose particular legislation. In addition, trade groups attempt to influence the activities of regulatory bodies.

In the United States, direct contributions by PACs to candidates are required to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission or state and local election overseers; are considered public information; and have registration requirements for lobbyists (FEC: Lobbyist). Even so, it can sometimes be difficult to trace the funding for issue and non-electoral campaigns.

In Slovenia, the government&#x27;s approach to consulting business associations has been noted by the European Commission as a good practice example.

==Publishing==
Almost all trade associations are heavily involved in publishing activities in print and online. The main media published by trade associations are as follows:
* Association website. The association&#x27;s corporate website typically explains the association&#x27;s aims and objectives, promotes the association&#x27;s products and services, explains the benefits of membership to prospective members, and promotes members&#x27; businesses (for example, by means of an online listing of members and description of their businesses).
* Members newsletters or magazines. Whether produced in print or online, association newsletters and magazines contain news about the activities of the association, industry news and editorial features on topical issues. Some are exclusively distributed to members, while others are used to lobby lawmakers and regulators, and some are used to promote members&#x27; businesses to potential new customers.
* Printed membership directories and yearbooks. Larger trade associations publish membership directories and yearbooks to promote their association to opinion formers, lawmakers, regulators and other stakeholders. Such publications also help to promote members&#x27; businesses both to each other and to a wider audience. A typical membership directory contains profiles of each association member, a products and services guide, advertising from members, and editorial articles about the aims, objectives and activities of the association. The emphasis of association yearbooks on the other hand is on editorial features about the association itself and the association&#x27;s industry.

The opportunity to be promoted in such media (whether by editorial or advertising) is often an important reason why companies join a trade association in the first place.

Examples of larger trade associations that publish a comprehensive range of media include European Wind Energy Association (EWEA), Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).

==Generic advertising==
Industry trade groups sometimes produce advertisements, just as normal corporations do. However, whereas typical advertisements are for a specific corporate product, such as a specific brand of cheese or toilet paper, industry trade groups advertisements generally are targeted to promote the views of an entire industry.

===Ads to improve industry image===
These ads mention only the industry&#x27;s products as a whole, painting them in a positive light in order to have the public form positive associations with that industry and its products. For example, in the US the advertising campaign &quot;Beef. It&#x27;s what&#x27;s for dinner&quot; is used by the National Cattlemen&#x27;s Beef Association to promote a positive image of beef in the public consciousness.

===Ads to shape opinion on a specific issue===
These are adverts targeted at specific issues. For example, in the US in the early 2000s the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) began running advertisements before films that advocate against movie piracy over the Internet.

==Controversy==
Trade associations have faced frequent criticism due to allegations that they operate not as profit-making organizations, but rather as fronts for cartels involved in anti-competitive practices and price fixing. Critics contend that these associations engage in activities such as price-fixing, the creation and maintenance of barriers to entry in the industry, and other subtle self-serving actions that are detrimental to the public interest. These criticisms raise concerns about the true nature and intentions of trade associations, questioning their commitment to fair competition and the welfare of the broader economy.

===Anti-competitive activity===
Jon Leibowitz, a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, outlined the potentially anti-competitive nature of some trade association activity in a speech to the American Bar Association in Washington, DC, in March 2005 called &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: Trade Associations and Antitrust&quot;. For instance, he said that under the guise of &quot;standard setting&quot;, trade associations representing the established players in an industry can set rules that make it harder for new companies to enter a market.

===Cartels===
In September 2007, the German trade association for Fachverband Verbindungs- und Befestigungstechnik (VBT) and five fastener companies were fined 303 million euros by the European Commission for operating cartels in the markets for fasteners and attaching machines in Europe and worldwide. In one of the cartels, the YKK Group, Coats plc, the Prym group, the Scovill group, A. Raymond, and Berning &amp; Söhne &quot;agreed [...] on coordinated price increases in annual &#x27;price rounds&#x27; with respect to &#x27;other fasteners&#x27; and their attaching machines, in the framework of work circles organised by VBT&quot;.

<doc id="536701" wikidata="Q923966" url="?curid=536701" title="Layla">
<text>&quot;Layla&quot; is a song written by Eric Clapton and Jim Gordon, originally recorded with their band Derek and the Dominos, as the thirteenth track from their only studio album, &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; (1970). Its contrasting movements were composed separately by Clapton and Gordon. The piano part has also been controversially credited to Rita Coolidge, Gordon&#x27;s girlfriend at the time.

The song was inspired by a love story that originated in 7th-century Persian literature and later formed the basis of &quot;The Story of Layla and Majnun&quot; by the 12th-century Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, a copy of which Ian Dallas had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, because it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful young girl, went crazy and so could not marry her. The song was further inspired by Clapton&#x27;s secret love for Pattie Boyd, the wife of his friend and fellow musician George Harrison. After Harrison and Boyd divorced, Clapton and Boyd eventually married.

&quot;Layla&quot; has, since its release, experienced great critical and popular acclaim, and is often hailed as being among the greatest rock songs of all time. Two versions have achieved chart success, the first in 1972 and the second 20 years later as an acoustic &quot;Unplugged&quot; performance by Clapton. In 2004, &quot;Layla&quot; was ranked number 27 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, and the acoustic version won the 1993 Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.

==Background==
In 1966, Beatles guitarist George Harrison married Pattie Boyd, a model he met two years before during the filming of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. During the late 1960s, Clapton and Harrison became close friends. Clapton contributed uncredited (although openly acknowledged) guitar work on Harrison&#x27;s song &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; on the Beatles&#x27; self-titled double album (also known as the White Album), and Harrison co-wrote and played guitar on Cream&#x27;s &quot;Badge&quot; from &quot;Goodbye&quot;. However, between his tenures in Cream and Blind Faith, Clapton fell in love with Boyd.

The title of &quot;Layla&quot; was inspired by the story of &quot;Layla and Majnun&quot;, which Clapton had been told by his friend Ian Dallas, who was in the process of converting to Islam. Nizami&#x27;s tale, about a moon princess who was married off by her father to a man she did not love, resulting in Majnun&#x27;s madness, struck a deep chord with Clapton.

Boyd divorced Harrison in 1977 and married Clapton in 1979 during a concert stop in Tucson, Arizona. Harrison was not bitter about the divorce and attended Clapton&#x27;s wedding party with his former bandmates Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney. During their relationship, Clapton wrote another love ballad for Boyd, &quot;Wonderful Tonight&quot; (1977). Clapton and Boyd divorced in 1989.

==Writing and recording==
After the break-up of Cream, Clapton tried his hand with several groups, including Blind Faith and the husband-and-wife duo Delaney &amp; Bonnie. In the spring of 1970, he was told that some members of Delaney &amp; Bonnie&#x27;s back-up band, including bassist Carl Radle, drummer Jim Gordon and keyboardist Bobby Whitlock, were leaving the group. Seizing the opportunity, Clapton formed a new group with Whitlock, Radle and Gordon. Naming themselves Derek and the Dominos, the band &quot;made our bones&quot;, according to Clapton, while backing Harrison on his first post-Beatles solo album, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;.

During the recording of the &quot;Layla&quot; album, Duane Allman joined Clapton&#x27;s fledgling band as a guest. Clapton and Allman, already mutual fans, were introduced by Tom Dowd at an Allman Brothers concert at the Miami Beach Convention Center on 26 August 1970. The two hit it off well and soon became good friends. Dowd said of their guitar-playing chemistry: &quot;There had to be some sort of telepathy going on because I&#x27;ve never seen spontaneous inspiration happen at that rate and level. One of them would play something, and the other reacted instantaneously. Never once did either of them have to say, &#x27;Could you play that again, please?&#x27; It was like two hands in a glove. And they got tremendously off on playing with each other.&quot; Dowd was already famous for a variety of work and had worked with Clapton in his Cream days (Clapton once called him &quot;the ideal recording man&quot;); his work on the album would be another achievement. For the making of his biographical film &quot;Tom Dowd &amp; the Language of Music&quot;, he remixed the original master tapes of &quot;Layla&quot;, saying, &quot;There are my principles, in one form or another.&quot;

Clapton originally wrote &quot;Layla&quot; as a ballad, with lyrics describing his unrequited love for Boyd, but the song became a &quot;rocker&quot; when, according to Clapton, Allman composed the song&#x27;s signature riff. With the band assembled and Dowd producing, &quot;Layla&quot; was recorded in its rock form. The recording of the first section consisted of sixteen tracks of which six were guitar tracks: a rhythm part by Clapton, three tracks of harmonies played by Clapton (the main power chord riff on both channels and two harmonies against that main riff, one on the left channel and one on the right channel), a track of solos by Allman (fretted solos with bent notes during the verses and a slide solo during the outro), and one track with both Allman and Clapton playing duplicate solos (the 7-note &quot;signature&quot; riff doubled in two octaves and the 12-note &quot;signature&quot; riff doubled in unison). According to Clapton, Allman played the first seven notes of the 12-note &quot;signature&quot; riff fretted and the last five notes on slide in standard tuning. Each player used one input of the same two-input Fender Champ amplifier.

Shortly afterwards, Clapton returned to the studio, where he heard Jim Gordon playing a piano piece he had composed separately. Impressed by the piece, Clapton convinced Gordon to allow it to be used as part of the song. Though only Gordon has been credited with this part, according to Whitlock, &quot;Jim took that piano melody from his ex-girlfriend Rita Coolidge. I know because in the D&amp;B days I lived in John Garfield&#x27;s old house in the Hollywood Hills and there was a guest house with an upright piano in it. Rita and Jim were up there in the guest house and invited me to join in on writing this song with them called &#x27;Time&#x27; ... Her sister Priscilla wound up recording it with Booker T. Jones ... Jim took the melody from Rita&#x27;s song and didn&#x27;t give her credit for writing it. Her boyfriend ripped her off.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; ended up on the 1973 album &quot;Chronicles&quot; by Booker T. and Priscilla Jones. Whitlock&#x27;s story was echoed by Coolidge herself in her 2016 autobiography. The claim is also repeated in Graham Nash&#x27;s 2014 autobiography &quot;Wild Tales&quot;.

&quot;Layla&quot;&#x27;s second movement (the &quot;Piano Exit&quot;) was recorded roughly a week after the first, with Gordon playing his piano part, Clapton playing acoustic guitar and slide guitar, and Allman playing electric and bottleneck slide guitar. After Dowd spliced the two movements together, &quot;Layla&quot; was complete.

The opening five bars to the guitar part of &quot;Layla&quot;

Due to the circumstances of its composition, &quot;Layla&quot; is defined by two movements, each marked by a riff. The first movement, which was recorded in the key of D minor for choruses and C-sharp minor for verses, is centred on the &quot;signature riff&quot;, a guitar piece using hammer-ons, pull-offs and power chords. The first section contains the overdub-heavy slide guitar solo, played by Allman. By placing his slide at points beyond the end of the fretboard, Allman was able to play notes at a higher pitch than could be played with standard technique. Dowd referred to this as &quot;notes that aren&#x27;t on the instrument.&quot;

The second movement is commonly referred to as the &quot;Piano Exit&quot;. Originally played in C major, the tape speed of the coda was increased slightly during mixing. The resulting pitch is somewhere between C and C sharp. The piano interlude at the end of the song is augmented by an acoustic guitar, and is also the accompaniment to the outro-solo. The same melody is also played on Allman&#x27;s slide guitar an octave higher. Gordon does not improvise or deviate from the piano part; Clapton and Allman are the ones who improvise the melody. The song ends with Allman playing his signature high-pitched &quot;bird call&quot; on his slide guitar. This portion is featured prominently in the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;.

Clapton commented on the song:

Pattie Boyd later reflected: &quot;I think that he was amazingly raw at the time ... He&#x27;s such an incredible musician that he&#x27;s able to put his emotions into music in such a way that the audience can feel it instinctively. It goes right through you.&quot;

==Beyond the original album==
&quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; opened to lacklustre sales as the Derek and the Dominos album never actually reached the music charts in the United Kingdom, possibly in part because Clapton&#x27;s name was found only on the back cover. In addition, the song&#x27;s length proved prohibitive for radio airplay. As a result, a shortened version of the song, consisting of the first 2:43 of Part I, was released as a single in March 1971 by Atco Records in the United States. The version peaked at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. When &quot;Layla&quot; was re-released on the 1972 compilations &quot;The History of Eric Clapton&quot; and Duane Allman&#x27;s &quot;An Anthology&quot; and then released the full 7:10 version (including the &quot;Piano Exit&quot; that formed Part II) as a single, it charted at number seven in the United Kingdom and reached number 10 in the United States. With good sales figures, the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine was able to rank the Rock single as the 60th best-selling song in 1972.

In 1982, &quot;Layla&quot; was re-released as a single in the United Kingdom, and peaked at number four. This time the whole seven-minute single charted, containing the trailing two-thirds which is instrumental only. Critical opinion since has been overwhelmingly positive. Dave Marsh, in &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll&quot;, wrote that &quot;there are few moments in the repertoire of recorded rock where a singer or writer has reached so deeply into himself that the effect of hearing them is akin to witnessing a murder or a suicide... to me &#x27;Layla&#x27; is the greatest of them.&quot; Marsh listed &quot;Layla&quot; at number 156 in his &quot;The Heart of Rock &amp; Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made&quot;.

In May 1980, &quot;Layla&quot; was covered by the London Symphony Orchestra, but without the lyrics, being recorded at EMI Studio One, Abbey Road, London. A similar version has been performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. On 20 September 1983, a benefit show called the ARMS Charity Concert for Multiple Sclerosis at the Royal Albert Hall in London featured a jam with Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page performing &quot;Layla&quot;. Clapton, Beck, and Page were the Yardbirds&#x27; successive lead guitarists from 1963 to 1968.

In 2003, the Allman Brothers Band began playing the song in concert. Warren Haynes sang the vocal, Gregg Allman played the piano part, and Derek Trucks played Duane Allman&#x27;s guitar parts during the coda. The performances were seen as a tribute not only to Allman, but also to producer Tom Dowd, who had died the previous year. Eric Clapton recorded yet a third version. &quot;Layla&quot; appears as track seven on &quot;Play the Blues: Live from Jazz at Lincoln Center&quot;. Personnel on this version include Wynton Marsalis (vocals, trumpet), Eric Clapton (vocals, guitar), Victor Goines (clarinet), Marcus Printup (trumpet), Chris Crenshaw (trombone, vocals), Don Vappie (banjo), Chris Stainton (keyboards), Dan Nimmer (piano), Carlos Henriquez (bass), and Ali Jackson (drums).

==&quot;Unplugged&quot; version==
===Recording===
In 1992, Clapton was invited to play for the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; series. On 16 January 1992, he recorded an acoustic album, accompanied by a concert film, at the Bray Studios in Bray, Berkshire. Although the production team and Clapton&#x27;s staff liked the recordings, Clapton did not want to release either the album or the concert film. Finally, Clapton agreed to release the album in a limited edition. When &quot;Unplugged&quot; sold out, Clapton gave Warner Bros. and Reprise Records the permission to delete the limited album production. For the album, Clapton decided to record both new material like &quot;Lonely Stranger&quot; and old songs he grew up with such as &quot;Nobody Knows You When You&#x27;re Down and Out&quot; or enjoyed listening to or had written as an adult, like &quot;San Francisco Bay Blues&quot; and &quot;Layla&quot;. Clapton, who plays acoustic guitar and sings on the live track, was backed by Andy Fairweather Low who played acoustic rhythm guitar, Nathan East on acoustic bass guitar and background vocals, Ray Cooper on percussion, Steve Ferrone on drums, Katie Kissoon and Tessa Niles on background vocals as well as Chuck Leavell on piano. Pianist Chuck Leavell recalled that recording the acoustic version of &quot;Layla&quot; felt natural to him and liked that the band was given some space to play during the body of the song and not just during the reprise like it is on the original recording. &quot;It gave us a chance to interpret the song in our way and it did work out well and it gave it a rebirth I think&quot;, Leavell said. The acoustic version of &quot;Layla&quot; was produced by Russ Titelman.

Clapton recorded the acoustic version of &quot;Layla&quot; on a C.F. Martin &amp; Co. steel-string acoustic guitar in OOO-42 style from 1939 which was hand built in Nazareth, Pennsylvania (No. OOO-42/73234). Clapton called this guitar one of the finest instruments he has ever used and called its sound &quot;incredible&quot;. The auction house Christie&#x27;s noted, &quot;the guitar became one of the most enduring images of recent music history&quot; being a part of the &quot;Unplugged&quot; album cover. Christie&#x27;s expert for the musical department Kerry Keane called the instrument &quot;in the hands of Eric Clapton singly responsible for the repolarization of playing acoustic guitar today&quot;. When Keane played the guitar, he also remarked an &quot;amazing&quot; sound as the acoustic guitar seems to have a &quot;wonderfully balanced tone [which is] loud and sweet at the same time with an incredible bass note.&quot; The vintage instrument was estimated to sell for between $60,000 and $80,000 but was in the end sold for $791,500.

===Arrangement===
Rhythm acoustic guitar player Andy Fairweather Low was invited by Clapton to his flat in Chelsea, London, to work out the songs to be recorded for the &quot;Unplugged&quot; album in January 1992. During the process, Clapton suggested that it would be a good idea to do another version of &quot;Layla&quot;. Fairweather Low agreed because he had wanted to release one himself as a big Derek and the Dominos fan. Clapton thought that the perfect arrangement for the rock anthem would be a shuffle because he always liked changing the tempo of a song and looking at something from a different angle.

When Clapton was asked about the acoustic version of the song by the MTV Network, he replied: Layla&#x27; sort of mystified me. I have done it the same all these years and never ever considered trying to revamp it. And a lot of artists do that, you know? Bob Dylan for instance changes everything everytime he plays it and I thought this was another great opportunity to just take it off on a different path, to put it to a shuffle and for a start, making it acoustic denied all the riffs, really. They would have sounded a bit weak, I think, on the acoustic guitar, so it just seemed to become Jazzier somehow. And of course, I&#x27;m singing it a whole octave down. So it gives it a nice kind of atmosphere.&quot;

The song was written in the key of D minor which Clapton recalled pushed him to the top of his singing range. When Clapton slowed it down, Fairweather Low suggested Clapton should sing the track a whole octave down. Clapton was pleased with the result as it sounded &quot;nice&quot; and &quot;sort of Jazzy&quot; to him. The new arrangement slowed down and reworked the original riff and dispensed with the piano coda. Because Clapton changed the arrangement so much, he decided to introduce this version to the unsuspecting live audience by stating: &quot;See if you can spot this one.&quot;

===Reception===
AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that &quot;Layla&quot; seemed to be the &quot;Unplugged&quot; album&#x27;s hit; he describes it as a &quot;slow crawl through Derek &amp; the Dominos&#x27; version, turning that anguished howl of pain into a cozy shuffle and the whole album proceeds at a similar amiable gait, taking its time and enjoying detours into old blues standards.&quot; Journalist Steve Hochman called the acoustic version a &quot;low-key but seductive recasting&quot;. Music broadcaster VH1 thinks the &quot;Unplugged&quot; version revealed Clapton&#x27;s guitar skills in the acoustic setting, which was particularly obvious on the reworking of &quot;Layla&quot; that &quot;stressed Clapton&#x27;s tender side without forfeitting intensity&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; journalists picked the tune as the mega hit off the &quot;Unplugged&quot; album. The critics especially liked Leavell&#x27;s piano work on the song, saying that it &quot;adds a smoky-jazz-joint torch-song ambience that&#x27;s both expectation shattering and emotionally compelling to the tune&quot;.

==Critical reception and legacy==
In 1970, &quot;Jamrock Entertainment&quot; listed &quot;Layla&quot; as the best song of the year. In 1972, &quot;Layla&quot; was one of the most performed songs of the year, and was already considered a &quot;rock standard&quot;. With its re-release in 1982, the song was again praised. It is featured on a number of &quot;greatest ever&quot; lists. The song was chosen by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of its &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song at number 27 on their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. The Recording Industry Association of America ranked &quot;Layla&quot; at number 118 on their Songs of the Century on 7 March 2001. Music critic Dave Marsh placed the tune at number two in his &quot;Best Singles of the Year 1972&quot; compilation.

With its reworking in 1992 for the &quot;Unplugged&quot; album, &quot;Layla&quot; became an all-time hit song, as it won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song in 1993, and was broadcast nonstop in 1992 and 1993 on the radio, in stores, and on television around the globe. In 1992, &quot;Layla&quot; was the most performed song of the year, and won a BMI Broadcasting Award for radio and television appearances of the 1992 &quot;Layla&quot; for more than two million times in summer of 1994. As of 2011, &quot;Layla&quot; had attained more than six million broadcasts on television and the radio or performances on other records and during live concerts.

&quot;Layla&quot; was used in &quot;Goodfellas&quot; during the scene portraying the aftermath of the 1978 Lufthansa heist. Director Martin Scorsese planned out the sequence with the song specifically in mind, playing it on set to synchronise with the staging and camera movement. The song also plays during the film&#x27;s ending credits, after a cover of &quot;My Way&quot; by Sid Vicious.

American record producer DJ Khaled sampled the Derek and the Dominos&#x27; arrangement of &quot;Layla&quot; in his 2021 song &quot;I Did It&quot; featuring American rappers Post Malone, Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Baby and DaBaby.

<text>Sir John Marks Templeton (29 November 1912 – 8 July 2008) was an American-born British investor, banker, fund manager, and philanthropist. In 1954, he entered the mutual fund market and created the Templeton Growth Fund, which averaged growth over 15% per year for 38 years. A pioneer of emerging market investing in the 1960s, &quot;Money&quot; magazine named him &quot;arguably the greatest global stock picker of the century&quot; in 1999.

==Early life and education==
John Marks Templeton was born in the town of Winchester, Tennessee, and attended Yale University, where he was an assistant business manager for campus humor magazine &quot;Yale Record&quot; and was selected for membership in the Elihu society. He financed his tuition with a scholarship, odd jobs and winnings from playing poker, a game at which he excelled. He graduated in 1934 near the top of his class. He attended Balliol College, Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar and earned an M.A. in law. He was a CFA charterholder and was a student of the &quot;father of value investing&quot;, Benjamin Graham.

== Investment career ==
In 1939, Templeton, during the Depression of the 1930s, had his broker purchase 100 shares of each NYSE-listed company which was then selling for less than $1 a share () (104 companies, 34 in bankruptcy, in 1939), later making many times the money back when US industry picked up as a result of World War II. According to Templeton, he called his broker the day World War II began and instructed him to make the purchases. This stratagem helped make him a wealthy man.

Templeton became a billionaire by pioneering the use of globally diversified mutual funds. His Templeton Growth Fund, Ltd. (investment fund), established in 1954, was among the first American firms to invest in Japan starting in the mid-1960s. Templeton also created funds specifically in certain industries such as nuclear energy, chemicals, and electronics. By 1959, Templeton&#x27;s company made their initial public offering, with five funds and more than 66 million dollars under management.

In 2006 he was listed in a seven-way tie for 129th place on &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;″s &quot;Rich List&quot;.

== Investment philosophy ==
&quot;Money&quot; magazine in 1999 called him &quot;arguably the greatest global stock picker of the century&quot;. Templeton attributed much of his success to his ability to maintain an elevated mood, avoid anxiety and stay disciplined. He rejected technical analysis for stock trading, preferring instead to use fundamental analysis. Thus he did not attempt to predict future stock movements, but paid close attention to valuation. From the late 1930s Templeton and his colleagues developed sophisticated quantitative finance methods that anticipated by decades common features such as the Shiller P/E, rebalancing and Tobin&#x27;s q.

Despite the name of his flagship fund, Templeton Growth Fund, he was more a practitioner of value investing rather than growth investing. However, his stock-selection strategies could be eclectic and often defied easy categorization other than avoiding stocks he considered expensive, defined as an estimated five-year forward price to earnings ratio higher than about 12-14. Templeton focused on buying stocks he calculated were substantially undervalued, holding them until selling when their price rose to fair market value. His average holding period was about four years. He believed holding assets priced above fair market value in hopes they would further increase in price was speculation, not investing. However, Templeton did not buy stocks merely because they were undervalued but also took care investing in companies he determined were profitable, well-managed and with good long-term potential.

By emphasizing overlooked or unpopular stocks Templeton was in many ways a contrarian and became known for his &quot;avoiding the herd&quot; and &quot;buy when there&#x27;s blood in the streets&quot; philosophy to take advantage of market turmoil. He also was known for taking profits when values and expectations were high. His time at Oxford started an interest in global investing, which was uncommon in the United States but more popular in the UK due to the widespread British Empire. Templeton was one of the earliest American investors to devote substantial focus to investment opportunities in then-overlooked foreign markets such as Asia and Eastern Europe. He was such an early investor in Japan during the 1950s that he had difficulty finding bi-lingual stockbrokers in either Japan or the United States to handle his firm&#x27;s trades. Always on the lookout for bargain-priced stocks and hoping to avoid expensive stocks, he rotated out of Japanese stocks as they became more fashionable in the 1970s and turned to US stocks when they were at historic lows. Templeton&#x27;s flagship fund outperformed a global stock index by an average of three percent a year for his entire career, and by over six percent a year for the period after his relocation to the Bahamas. Typical of value-oriented investors, Templeton often had disappointing results during bull markets due to his avoidance of hot stocks of the moment. His outperformance typically came during crashes and bear markets when his fund suffered smaller losses than average, or had modest gains relative to the broad market.

In 2005, he wrote a brief memorandum predicting that within five years there would be financial chaos in the world, anticipating a collapse of the housing market and decline in yields on government-issued bonds to near zero. Templeton also predicted within the next few decades a major decrease in traditional schooling due to internet-based learning options. Initially privately circulated to family and a small number of Franklin-Templeton management, the memo was eventually made public in 2010.

Templeton was a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) charter-holder. He received AIMR&#x27;s first award for professional excellence in 1991.

==Personal life==
Templeton married Judith Folk in 1937, and the couple had three children: John, Anne, and Christopher. Judith Templeton died in February 1951 in a motorbike accident. He remarried, to Irene Reynolds Butler in 1958; she died in 1993. A Christian, he was a lifelong member of the Presbyterian Church. He served as an elder of the First Presbyterian Church of Englewood (Englewood, New Jersey). He was a trustee on the board of Princeton Theological Seminary, the largest Presbyterian seminary, for 42 years and served as its chair for 12 years.

In 1964, Templeton renounced his US citizenship, which some sources claim was a strategy to minimize taxes (the United States taxes citizens globally regardless of residency). However, in a 1997 interview with Charlie Rose, Templeton asserted the Bahamas had a higher tax rate than the United States and denied he renounced his citizenship to avoid paying taxes to the United States, stating he intended to live out his life in the Bahamas and felt obligated. He held dual naturalised Bahamian and British citizenship and lived in the Bahamas full-time from 1968. His neighbors included Joe Lewis, Sean Connery, Arthur Hailey, and Fahad Al Sabah.

Uninterested in consumerism, Templeton lived relatively frugally and never flew first-class. A friend jokingly described Templeton as Calvinist in his approach to wealth: &quot;He believes it&#x27;s okay to make money so long as you don&#x27;t enjoy it.&quot; 

On 8 July 2008, Templeton died at Doctors Hospital in Nassau, Bahamas, of pneumonia at 12:20. He was 95, and was survived by his children, Anne, Christopher and John. John Templeton Jr. has since died, in 2015, of brain cancer.

== Wealth and philanthropy ==
Templeton was one of the most generous philanthropists in history, giving away over $1 billion to charitable causes. 

In 2007, Templeton was named to the Time 100 list as one of the world&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People by &quot;Time&quot; under the category of &quot;Power Givers&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; cited his &quot;pursuit of spiritual understanding, often through scientific research&quot; through his establishment of the John Templeton Foundation.

As a philanthropist, Templeton established:

*the Templeton Prize for Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities in 1972.
*the Templeton Library in Sewanee, Tennessee, on a hillside 2 miles from and overlooking The University of the South, and which is 12 miles from his birthplace of Winchester, Tennessee. The building was intended to house his papers and &quot;a collection of literature concerning science and religion, promoting scholarly research that combines the two fields&quot;.
*the Templeton College of the University of Oxford (by endowing the Oxford Centre for Management Studies in 1983 to become a full college of the university by royal charter in 1995).

Templeton College is closely associated with Oxford&#x27;s Saïd Business School. In 2007, Templeton College transferred its executive education program to Saïd Business School. In 2008, Templeton College merged with Green College to form Green Templeton College. This is one of the exceptional mergers in recent history of the University of Oxford.

He was created a Knight Bachelor in 1987 for his philanthropic efforts. Templeton was inducted into the Junior Achievement US Business Hall of Fame in 1996, and in 2003 awarded the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership.

=== Templeton Religion Trust ===
Templeton Religion Trust (TRT) is a global charitable trust chartered by Sir John Templeton in 1984, with headquarters in Nassau, The Bahamas, where Sir John lived until his death in 2008. TRT has been active since 2012 and supports projects and the dissemination of results from projects seeking to enrich the conversation about religion via three broad initiatives:

*Improving the methods of inquiry into the existence and nature of spiritual realities.
*Bringing about and enhancing the “conditions of possibility” of cooperative, constructive engagement (aka “Covenantal Pluralism”) in the context of religion.
*Establishing the fact and improving our understanding of the underlying dynamics of the often overlooked or unforeseen benefits of religious faith and practice at its best.

TRT&#x27;s aim is to improve the well-being of individuals and societies through spiritual growth and an ever-improving understanding of spiritual realities and spiritual information.

TRT is the first of three charitable entities established by Sir John Templeton. The other entities are the John Templeton Foundation and the Templeton World Charity Foundation. While all three organizations have similar aims, they operate as separate charitable entities.

=== John Templeton Foundation ===
As a member of the Presbyterian Church, Templeton was dedicated to his faith. However, Templeton eschewed dogma and declared relatively little was known about the divine through scripture, espousing what he called a &quot;humble approach&quot; to theology and remaining open to the benefits and values of other faiths. Commenting on his commitment to what he called spiritual progress, &quot;But why shouldn&#x27;t I try to learn more? Why shouldn&#x27;t I go to Hindu services? Why shouldn&#x27;t I go to Muslim services? If you are not egotistical, you will welcome the opportunity to learn more.&quot; Similarly, one of the major goals of the John Templeton Foundation is to proliferate the monetary support of spiritual discoveries. The John Templeton Foundation encourages research into &quot;big questions&quot; by awarding philanthropic aid to institutions and people who pursue the answers to such questions through &quot;explorations into the laws of nature and the universe, to questions on the nature of love, gratitude, forgiveness, and creativity.&quot;

In an interview published in the Financial Intelligence Report in 2005, Templeton asserts that the purpose of the John Templeton Foundation is as follows: &quot;We are trying to persuade people that no human has yet grasped 1% of what can be known about spiritual realities. So we are encouraging people to start using the same methods of science that have been so productive in other areas, in order to discover spiritual realities.&quot; In 2004, Templeton donated an additional $550 million to the foundation.

<doc id="536709" wikidata="Q1260606" url="?curid=536709" title="The Estée Lauder Companies">
<text>The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. ( ; stylized as ESTĒE LAUDER) is an American multinational cosmetics company, a manufacturer and marketer of makeup, skincare, perfume, and hair care products, based in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It is the second largest cosmetics company in the world after L&#x27;Oréal. The company owns a diverse portfolio of brands, including La Mer, Jo Malone London, Clinique and Tom Ford Beauty, among many more, distributed internationally through both digital commerce and retail channels.

==History==
The company began in 1946 when Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All-purpose Creme, and Creme Pack. Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.

Over the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.

In 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac. In 1967, Estée Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors. This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique, a dermatologist-guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy-tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand.

Estée Lauder&#x27;s Clinique brand became the first women&#x27;s cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called &quot;Skin Supplies for Men&quot;, which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company&#x27;s products became available in the Soviet Union.

In the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins – the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton, an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).

Brand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based MAC Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer – along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Crème de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth. The company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.

On November 16, 1995, the Estée Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $26.00 a share ($6.50 on a post-split basis).

Acquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as the Estée Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in the hair salon Bumble and bumble and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand.

She oversaw the opening of the company&#x27;s first location in the USSR one week after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Wagner launched marketing campaigns in over 100 countries for the company.

==Controversies==
===SOPA===
Estée Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.

===Child labor===
In 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York, making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder&#x27;s natural products brands. The contracted company was Common Sense Natural Soap &amp; Bodycare, owned by a group led by cult leader Yoneq Gene Spriggs. Estee Lauder said it immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, stating it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.

===Animal testing===
The Estée Lauder Companies perform non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. Estée Lauder Companies product goes through animal testing where required by law by its country government. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products. This causes controversy for smaller brands that are &quot;cruelty free&quot; but were acquired by Estée Lauder.

===Boycott and anti-boycott===

Since at least February 2001, Estée Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign led by pro-Palestine activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder. In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their &quot;Estée Slaughter&quot; campaign. The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.

<text>HMAS &quot;Teal&quot; (M 1152) (formerly HMS &quot;Jackton&quot;) was a operated by the Royal Navy (RN) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Construction==
The vessel was built by Philip and Son, Dartmouth and launched on 28 February 1955, and commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Jackton&quot;.

==Operational history==

===Australia===
The ship was purchased by the RAN in 1961, and was commissioned as HMAS &quot;Teal&quot; on 30 August 1962.

During the mid-1960s, &quot;Teal&quot; was one of several ships operating in support of the Malaysian government during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. On 13 December 1964 HMAS Teal intercepted two Indonesian sampans off Raffles Light in the south western corner of the Singapore Strait. One sampan opened fire when illuminated by Teal&#x27;s Signal Lamp. Teal retaliated, killing three of the sampan&#x27;s crew and the remainder of the enemy surrendered. One was an officer of the Indonesian Navy and the sampan was found to be carrying a quantity of explosives, weapons and other military equipment. This service was later recognised with the battle honour &quot;Malaysia 1964–66&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
HMAS &quot;Teal&quot; paid off on 14 August 1970. &quot;Teal&quot; was sold to Ian and Gary Baker, Tasmania. The vessel was transported to Tasmania where she was later sold. 

In 1994 &quot;Teal&quot; became a research and training ship for the maritime faculties of Near East University and the University of Kyrenia, in Northern Cyprus. On 11 September 2022, the ship was given a new berth in the port of Kyrenia, to become a maritime museum.

<doc id="536713" wikidata="Q5303519" url="?curid=536713" title="Downtown New Haven">
<text>Downtown New Haven is the neighborhood located in the heart of the city of New Haven, Connecticut. It is made up of the original nine squares laid out in 1638 to form New Haven, including the New Haven Green, and the immediate surrounding central business district, as well as a significant portion of the Yale University campus. The area includes many restaurants, cafes, theaters and stores. Downtown is bordered by Wooster Square to the east, Long Wharf to the southeast, the Hill neighborhood to the south, the Dwight neighborhood to the west, the Dixwell neighborhood to the northwest, the Prospect Hill area to the north, and East Rock to the northeast.

Downtown New Haven is one of the most residential downtown areas in the United States, with nearly 7,000 inhabitants. The expansion of housing options in recent years has helped support downtown businesses and has brought about a surge in economic activity. Secondary streets and areas at the periphery of the neighborhood that once contained vacant storefronts are now almost entirely leased to restaurants and retailers, and the office vacancy rate has dramatically fallen as well.

==Geography==
Downtown New Haven is divided into several independent sections centered on the New Haven Green. This basic structure is a remnant of the 1638 New Haven Plan. The main campus of Yale University, which is located to the north and west of the Green, is sometimes considered distinct from but intermingled with Downtown.

===Chapel Street===

The area bounded by Chapel and Crown Streets is a popular stretch of restaurants, boutiques and bars located across from the Old Campus of Yale University. Includes such historic establishments as Union League Cafe and the Owl Shop cigar lounge. The Anchor Bar, notable for its Art Moderne style and popularity with playwright Thornton Wilder, operated on College Street from the 1940s until 2015.

The area is largely coterminous with the Chapel Street Historic District. Notable buildings include the Hotel Taft and the Chapel Square Mall. The Yale University Art Gallery and Yale Center for British Art are also located here.

===Broadway===

The Broadway area is a commercial center that has since the 1990s been bought piece-by-piece by Yale University and redeveloped into &quot;The Shops at Yale&quot; shopping district. This section was previously notable as home of the Yankee Doodle Coffee Shop and Cutlers Records.

===Ninth Square===
The Ninth Square district, which contains the blocks southeast of the New Haven Green, has experienced a resurgence as a nightlife and arts district since the first decade of the 21st century.

The majority of buildings within these blocks are preserved as the Ninth Square Historic District.

===Whitney Avenue===

The Whitney Avenue corridor, north of the New Haven Green, contains shops and eateries that are primarily owned by Yale University and cater to its student population. This area serves as a center for New Haven&#x27;s East Asian community, with several restaurants and grocery stores catering to this population and an annual Chinese New Year festival parading up Whitney Avenue.

==Notable sites==
* Center Church on the Green Crypt, the best-preserved burial ground in the country (because it lies underneath a church), with gravestones dating back to the mid-17th century that include numerous colonial luminaries.
* Chapel Street Historic District, an area southwest of the Green containing many shops, restaurants, night clubs, bars, art museums, theaters, and book stores. The district is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and includes areas along Crown Street.
* Criterion Cinemas, a seven-screen movie theater showing first-run and international films.
* Grove Street Cemetery
* Harkness Tower
* Knights of Columbus Building
* Louis&#x27; Lunch Oldest hamburger restaurant still operating in U.S.
* New Haven City Hall
* New Haven County Courthouse
* New Haven Free Public Library
* New Haven Green
* Ninth Square Historic District, an NRHP-listed area of historic 19th and early 20th century commercial buildings, directly southeast of the Green. The area is also a special taxing district.
* Omni Hotel, a four-star high-rise hotel.
* Shubert Theatre
* Toad&#x27;s Place (officially within the Dixwell neighborhood)
* Yale Center for British Art
* Yale Repertory Theatre
* Yale University Art Gallery
* Yale University&#x27;s Old Campus

==Notable sites of the past==

* Chapel Square Mall (1967–2002). Now converted to luxury apartments; the first indoor shopping mall in the country to be converted as such.
* College Street Cinema
* College (Hyperion) Theater (1880–1998)
* The Edw. Malley Co. (1852–1982). Demolished in 1997 and replaced by Gateway Community College.
* Kresge&#x27;s. Converted into a parking garage.
* Macy&#x27;s. Demolished in 2007. Replaced by Gateway Community College.
* New Haven Arena (1914–1924, 1926-1972?)
* New Haven Coliseum (1972–2007). Razed and filled with a parking lot.
* Shartenberg&#x27;s Department Store (1915–1962). Razed in 1964 as part of Mayor Richard C. Lee&#x27;s redevelopment plans. For many years a parking lot, the site has been replaced by 360 State Street, a mixed-use development of high-rise condominiums, offices and apartments.
* York Square Cinema (1970–2005)

<doc id="536717" wikidata="Q6030890" url="?curid=536717" title="Information Technology Association of America">
<text>The Information Technology Association of America (ITAA), formerly the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations (ADAPSO), was a leading industry trade group for information technology companies. The association&#x27;s membership contained most of the world&#x27;s major Information and communications technology (ICT) firms, accounting for over 90% of ICT goods and services sold in North America. By 2009, the organization had merged with others to form TechAmerica

== History ==

Organizational meetings of what was initially called the Data Actuating Technical Association (DATA) began in 1960. In 1961, the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations (ADAPSO) was founded as a &quot;service bureau&quot; trade association, and formally incorporated in 1962. Initially headquartered in Abington, Pennsylvania, then relocating to downtown New York city, ADAPSO published directories of the nascent industry, commissioned well-regarded surveys of the computer industry, and organized user-centered &quot;Management Symposiums&quot; that discussed the industry, pricing, and ethics. ADAPSO&#x27;s industry surveys were taken up by Peter Cunningham&#x27;s INPUT. ADAPSO moved to the Washington, D.C., area in 1978 to be closer to government policymakers and advocates.
ADAPSO was renamed ITAA in 1991.

In March 2007 ITAA President Phil Bond expressed his desire in merging ITAA with another high tech trade association. On January 17, 2008, ITAA announced that it had agreed to so-called &quot;merger of equals&quot; with the Government Electronics and Information Technology Association (GEIA), and that the combined association would retain the ITAA name. Until earlier in the year GEIA had been an affiliate of EIA (a trade association formerly known as the Electronic Industries Alliance) EIA has been very financially successful, unlike ITAA. GEIA is slated to share in the distribution over $50 million in assets resulting in the breakup of EIA. [The fall of EIA: What happened? 
In 2008 the ITAA merged with the CyberSecurity Industry Alliance and the Government Electronics Industry Association.

In 2009 the ITAA merged with the AeA (formerly the American Electronics Association) to form TechAmerica. Hank Steininger was the last ITAA board chair prior to the merger.

== Surveys==
ITAA conducted surveys of CIOs.

== Real ID ==
ITAA actively lobbied on behalf of the funding for the Real ID.

Some have asserted that Real ID will turn state driver&#x27;s licenses into a national identity card and impose numerous new burdens on taxpayers, citizens, immigrants, and state governments – while doing nothing to protect against terrorism. As a result, it is stirring intense opposition from many groups across the political spectrum. Critics have claimed that ITAA supports the national ID card because its member companies would benefit from financially from implementing the card.

== Publications ==

ITAA published a series of newsletters, beginning with &quot;ADAPSO News&quot; in the early 1960s. Its last regular newsletter, the &quot;ITAA E-LETTER&quot;, covered issues of the networked economy, including information and telecommunications public policy, and the businesses of electronic commerce, Internet service and enhanced telecommunications service providers. The ITAA E-LETTER was distributed free of charge by electronic mail.

Other ADAPSO and ITAA publications included &quot;ADAPSO Agenda&quot; (&quot;later ITAA Agenda&quot;), &quot;Computer Services: Official Journal of the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations&quot;, and &quot;Data&quot;.

<text>Big Muddy Creek is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 191 mi (307 km) long, in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan and the U.S. state of Montana. Its source is in the Big Muddy Badlands of Saskatchewan.

Big Muddy Creek begins in southern Saskatchewan at Big Muddy Lake, east of Big Beaver, Saskatchewan. It flows south through the Big Muddy Badlands and into Sheridan County, Montana, past Redstone. From there, east past Plentywood and then south forming the eastern border of Fort Peck Indian Reservation. It joins the Missouri west of Culbertson.

It was explored in 1805 by the Lewis and Clark Expedition, who called it Martha&#x27;s River in their journals and noticed on their return voyage in 1806 that it had changed its mouth on the Missouri.

Along with the Milk River and the Poplar River, it is one of three waterways in Canada that drain into the Gulf of Mexico.

== Variant names ==
Big Muddy Creek has also been known as: Big Muddy River, Little Yellow River, Martha River, Martha&#x27;s River, Marthas River, Marthy&#x27;s River and Park River.

<doc id="536732" wikidata="Q2896167" url="?curid=536732" title="Benjamin Bonneville">
<text>Benjamin Louis Eulalie de Bonneville (; April 14, 1796 – June 12, 1878) was an American officer in the United States Army, fur trapper, and explorer in the American West. He is noted for his expeditions to the Oregon Country and the Great Basin, and in particular for blazing portions of the Oregon Trail.

During his lifetime, Bonneville was made famous by an account of his explorations in the West written by Washington Irving.

==Early life==
Benjamin was born in or near Paris, France, the son of the French publisher Nicholas Bonneville and his wife Marguerite Brazier. When he was seven, his family moved to the United States; their passage was paid by Thomas Paine. Paine had lodged with the Bonnevilles in France and was godfather to Benjamin and his two brothers, Louis and Thomas. In his will, Paine left the bulk of his estate to Marguerite who had cared for him until he died in 1809. The inheritance included 100 acres (40.5 ha) of his New Rochelle, New York farm where they had been living, so she could maintain and educate her sons.

==Early career==
In 1813 Bonneville received an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated after only two years, receiving a commission as brevet second lieutenant of light artillery. In his early career, he served at posts in New England, Mississippi, and at Fort Smith in the Arkansas Territory.

In 1824, he was taken to Fort Gibson in the Indian Territory and promoted to captain. While traveling to France, he was a guest of General Lafayette. After returning from France, he was transferred in 1828 to Jefferson Barracks in Missouri.

While in Missouri, Bonneville was inspired by the writing of Hall J. Kelley, as well as editorials in the &quot;St. Louis Enquirer&quot; (edited at the time by Thomas Hart Benton) to join in the exploration of the American West. Bonneville met with Kelley, who was impressed by him and appointed him to lead one of the expeditions to the Oregon Country; it was scheduled to leave in early 1832. The lack of volunteers for the expedition forced the delay and eventual cancellation of the expedition, leaving Bonneville unrequited in his ambitions.

To pursue his desire to explore the west, he petitioned General Alexander Macomb for a leave of absence from the military, arguing that he would be able to perform valuable reconnaissance among the Native Americans in the Oregon Country, which at the time was under a precarious joint occupation of the U.S. and Britain. It was largely controlled by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Macomb granted his request, a 26-month leave running from August 1831 to October 1833, and instructed him to gather all information that might be useful to the government. In particular, he was to pose as a fur trader and find out the natural history of the region, its climates, soils, geography, topography, mineral production, geology, and the character of the local tribes. Expenses for his exploration were paid by private donors, including Astorian Alfred Seton and possibly John Jacob Astor.

==Marriage and family==
Bonneville married and had a daughter with his wife. After both his first wife and daughter died, he did not remarry until after retiring from the military in 1866, when he settled in Fort Smith, Arkansas. There he married Sue Neis.

==Expedition of 1832==
The expedition that would be known as the most notable accomplishment of his life began in May 1832, when Bonneville left Missouri with 110 men, with field lieutenants Michael Cerre and Joseph R. Walker. The voyage was financed by John Jacob Astor, a rival of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The expedition proceeded from Fort Osage on the Missouri River, up to the Platte River, and across present-day Wyoming. It reached the Green River in August and built a fur trading post, which it named Fort Bonneville. The mountain men called it &quot;Fort Nonsense&quot; and it was never used for trading.

In the spring of 1833, Bonneville explored along the Snake River in present-day Idaho, drifting into the head of the Salmon River and eventually into Fort Nez Perce. During this trip he engaged a guide, John Enos (Enos), a 10-year-old Shoshone nephew of Gourd Rattler (&quot;Washakie&quot;) and &quot;Pahdasherwahundah&quot; (Iron Wristbands); Enos later served as a scout for the Fremont expedition.

He also sent a party of men under Walker to explore the Great Salt Lake and find an overland route to California. Walker discovered a route along the Humboldt River across present-day Nevada, as well as Walker Pass across the Sierra Nevada. The path later became known as the California Trail, the primary route for immigrants to the gold fields during the California Gold Rush. Much speculation has surrounded Bonneville&#x27;s motivation for sending Walker to California. Some historians have speculated that he was attempting to lay the groundwork for an eventual invasion of California, then part of Mexico, by the United States Army.

John McLoughlin, the director of the Columbia operations of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River, heard of Bonneville&#x27;s mission. He forbade his traders from doing business with Bonneville and his men. Bonneville reported that many of the Native Americans he encountered in the Snake River were also reluctant to displease the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company by trading with Americans.

In the summer of 1833, Bonneville ventured into the Wind River Range in present-day Wyoming to trade with the Shoshone. By this time, he realized that he would not be able to return east by October as planned. He wrote a lengthy letter to General Macomb summarizing some of his findings and requesting more time, specifically to survey the Columbia River and parts of the Southwest before his return.

==Trying to reach Oregon==

After spending the early winter at Fort Bonneville, he set out westward in January 1834 with the goal of reaching the Willamette Valley. He and his men traveled down the Snake River, through Hells Canyon, and into the Wallowa Mountains, where they found a hospitable welcome by the Nez Perces along the Imnaha River.

On March 4, 1834, they reached Fort Nez Perces, the outpost of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at the confluence of the Walla Walla River with the Columbia. Pierre Pambrun, the HBC commander of the fort, welcomed him but refused to do business with him. Empty handed, Bonneville and men retraced their course back to southeast Idaho and made camp on the Portneuf River.

In July he made a second trip west, determined to trade with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He followed an easier route across the Blue Mountains, where he met Nathaniel Wyeth once again and camped along the Grande Ronde River. By this time he and his men had become desperate for food and supplies. At Fort Nez Perces, they found the same rejection from Pambrun. Instead of returning immediately east, Bonneville and men journeyed down the Columbia towards Fort Vancouver. Along the river, he attempted to trade with Sahaptins but without success. He came to realize that he would probably receive the same rejection from McLoughlin at Fort Vancouver and decided to turn back east.

He spent the winter of 1834–35 with the Shoshone along the upper Bear River, and in April 1835 began the voyage back to Missouri. He reached Independence by August and discovered that although his letter requesting an extension had arrived, it had not been delivered to Macomb. In the meantime, his commission had been revoked.

==Washington Irving==
Bonneville journeyed east hoping to be able to recover his commission. On the way to Washington, D.C., he stopped in New York City where he was received by his patron John Jacob Astor. While staying with Astor, Bonneville met Washington Irving. Bonneville regaled Irving with tales of his adventures, tales that Bonneville planned to include in a book he was working on.

A month or two later, Irving visited Bonneville again, at the D.C. barracks where the latter was staying. Bonneville was having difficulties writing his adventures. The two of them agreed that for the sum of $1000 ($ in dollars ), Bonneville would turn over his maps and notes so that Irving could use them as the basis for his third &quot;Western&quot; book. The result was &quot;The Adventures of Captain Bonneville&quot;, published in 1837.

==More military service==
In Washington, Bonneville petitioned tirelessly to Secretary of War Lewis Cass to have his commission reinstated. In early 1836 he was successful. In subsequent years, he was given assignments on the western frontier at Fort Kearny in the Nebraska Territory and in the New Mexico Territory at Fort Fillmore, where he became the commander of the third infantry regiment on February 3, 1855, after the death of Colonel Thomas Staniford. He also served in the Mexican–American War, taking part in the Veracruz campaign of Winfield Scott. He was part of the occupation of Mexico City. He was promoted to colonel of the 3rd Infantry Regiment in 1855, and twice commanded the Department of New Mexico.

Bonneville retired from active service in 1861 but was soon recalled to duty during the Civil War. From 1861 to 1863 he served as superintendent of recruiting in Missouri, and from 1862 to 1865 as commander of Benton Barracks in St. Louis. At the end of the war he was breveted as a brigadier general in honor of his long and distinguished career.

He retired a second time in 1866 and moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, where he married Sue Neis.

Bonneville died at age 82 in 1878. He is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

Bonneville was eligible to join both the Aztec Club of 1847 and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, military societies for officers who had served in the Mexican War and American Civil War, respectively, but he did not join either.

<text>Abū Bakr Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyà ibn aṣ-Ṣā’igh at-Tūjībī ibn Bājja (), best known by his Latinised name Avempace (;  – 1138), was an Andalusi polymath, whose writings include works regarding astronomy, physics, and music, as well as philosophy, medicine, botany, and poetry.

He was the author of the &quot;Kitāb an-Nabāt&quot; (&quot;The Book of Plants&quot;), a popular work on botany, which defined the sex of plants. His philosophical theories influenced the work of Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and Albertus Magnus. Most of his writings and books were not completed (or well-organized) due to his early death. He had a vast knowledge of medicine, mathematics, and astronomy. His main contribution to Islamic philosophy was his idea on soul phenomenology, which was never completed.

Avempace was, in his time, not only a prominent figure of philosophy but also of music and poetry. His &quot;diwan&quot; (Arabic: collection of poetry) was rediscovered in 1951. Though many of his works have not survived, his theories in astronomy and physics were preserved by Moses Maimonides and Averroes respectively, and influenced later astronomers and physicists in the Islamic civilization and Renaissance Europe, including Galileo Galilei.

Avempace wrote one of the first (argued by some to be the first) commentaries on Aristotle in the Western world. While his work on projectile motion was never translated from Arabic to Latin, his views became well known around the Western world and to Western philosophers, astronomers, and scientists of many disciplines. His works impacted contemporary medieval thought, and later influenced Galileo and his work. Avempace&#x27;s theories on projectile motion are found in the text known as &quot;Text 71&quot;.

==Biography==
He was born in Zaragoza, in what is today Aragon, Spain, around 1085 and died in Fes then under the Almoravid dynasty, in 1138. Rulers of Zaragoza shifted constantly throughout Avempace&#x27;s young life, but in 1114, a new Almoravid governor of Zaragoza was appointed: Abu Bakr &#x27;Ali ibn Ibrahim as-Sahrawi, also known as Ibn Tifilwit. The close relationship between Avempace and Ibn Tifilwit is verified in writings by Ibn al-Khatib. Avempace enjoyed music and wine with the governor and also composed panegyrics and muwashshahat to publicly praise Ibn Tifilwit, who rewarded him by nominating him as his vizier. In a diplomatic mission to meet the overthrown Imad ad-Dawla Ibn Hud King in his castle, Avempace was placed in jail for some months for reasons unknown. Ibn Tifilwit was also killed during a quest against the Christians in 1116, ending his short reign and inspiring Avempace to compose mournful elegies in his honor. Avempace also had a talent for singing and composition in music. In the beginning of his career, he wrote the manuscript &quot;Risālah fī l-alḥān&quot; (Tract on melodies) and incorporated his commentary on al-Fārābī’s treatise based on music. He determined the correlations between different melodies and temperament. According to biographer al-Maqqarī, Avempace&#x27;s passion for music was due to poetry and had “the virtue of dispelling the sadness and pain of the hearts [sic].” He included his scientific knowledge and wit in many poems. Avempace joined in poetic competitions with the poet al-Tutili.

After the fall of Zaragoza in 1118 by the hands of King Alfonso The Battler, Avempace looked for shelter under Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn Yûsuf Ibn Tashfin, another brother of the Almoravid Sultan (Ali Ibn Yusuf Ibn Tashfin) in Xàtiba. He worked, for some twenty years, as the vizier of Yusuf Ibn Tashfin. Throughout these decades, it is clear that Avempace was not as agreeable with those close to the ruler, Ibn Tashfin, as he was during the previous reign of Ibn Tifilwit. Writings by Ahmad al-Maqqari gives us insight into the hostility and disagreements between Avempace and the father of a famous physician respected by Ibn Tashfin, Abd al-Malik. A poetry anthology, Qala’id al-iqya (Necklace of Rubies)&quot;,&quot; was also created by a courtier of Ibn Tashufin&#x27;s, Abu Nasr al-Fath Ibn Muhammad Ibn Khaqan, which condescendingly placed Avempace in last place. Under Ibn Tashfin, the Sultan of the Almoravid empire, Avempace was imprisoned twice. The details of the imprisonment are not well understood, but can be assumed. Despite being unwelcomed, Avempace remained with the Almoravid empire for the rest of his life until his death in 1138. There has been evidence presented that brings up the argument that the cause of Avempace&#x27;s death was by poison from his peers. Al-Maqqari details in his writing that a physician, Abu l-&#x27;Ala&#x27; Ibn Zuhr, was an enemy of Avempace&#x27;s whose servant, Ibn Ma‛yub, was suspected of poisoning him at the time but was never convicted. Among his many teachers was Abu Jafar ibn Harun of Trujillo, a physician in Seville, Al-Andalus.

== Philosophy ==
Ibn Bajja, also known as Avempace, was an important Islamic philosopher, among his many other trades. In his time, he was seen as a controversial figure, receiving criticism from his peers like Ibn Tufayl. However, he was also respected by his peers and even his critics. While Ibn Tufayl was noted for criticizing Ibn Bajjah&#x27;s work, he also described him as having one of the sharpest minds with one of the soundest reasoning as compared to the others following the first generation of speakers.

Around his time, Islamic philosophy, and the post-hellenic world, was mainly divided into two opposing branches of thoughts. The Eastern branch, which was led by Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Latin, and the Western branch, which was led by Ibn Bajjah. Avempace&#x27;s work in philosophy is seen as uneven and mostly incomplete, but what parts of his work that survive to this day demonstrates originality in his thought process. His main philosophical work is the unfinished politico-ethical treatise &quot;Governance of the Solitary.&quot;

Upon his unplanned trip to Egypt, Avempace wrote &quot;Risālat al-wadāʿ&quot; (Letter of Bidding Farewell) and &quot;Risālat al-ittiṣāl al-ʿaql bi al-insān&quot; (Letter on the Union of the Intellect with Human Beings) that were dedicated to Ibn al-Imām. His famous works included &quot;Tadbīr al-mutawaḥḥid&quot; (Management of the Solitary), the &quot;Kitāb al-nafs&quot; (Book on the Soul), and the &quot;Risāla fī l-Ghāya al-insāniyya&quot; (Treatise on the Objective of Human Beings). The reflections of his famous accomplishments show how these were written near the end of his life. He was inspired based on Aristotelian line. In Avempace&#x27;s philosophy, it contains two key pillars, solitude and conjunction. Solitude represents the isolation philosopher commonly seeks in order to protect himself from the corruption of society and conjunction refers to the philosopher&#x27;s quest for the lowest celestial intelligence. It is required for the human soul&#x27;s development.

These works are tough to understand. Nevertheless, Risālat al-ittiṣāl has interpreted the introduction. The treatise stated the overall point of Avempace&#x27;s thinking:&quot;The ultimate end of man, namely the contemplation of truth, with the active intellect joining the human intellect in a contemplative and almost mystic way.&quot;However, the most important idea from Avempace&#x27;s system was not mentioned in the treatise, &quot;how the union of the active intellect with man occurs, which is the ultimate goal being pursued by the solitary.&quot;

From his writings, Ibn Bajjah has been shown to take a liking to Plato&#x27;s contribution to philosophy. Ibn Bajjah, in particular, takes from Plato&#x27;s idea of the necessary connection between man and city with a bit of a twist. Plato&#x27;s idea was to model the perfect city after the human soul. On the other hand, Avempace wanted to use the perfect city as a model for the human soul. Avempace imagines the perfect city as a place that is free of any beliefs or opinions that are in opposition of the truth and where true science reigns supreme. Any man or idea that contradicts these true beliefs are defined as &quot;weeds.&quot; Weeds are only to be found in imperfect cities.

Avempace also wrote on the health of a perfect man. He alluded to the idea that the perfect man does not just require physical health, but spiritual health too. Avempace goes into more detail about the soul, which he describes of having both an acquired intellect, as well as an active intellect. The active intellect has no basis coming from the physical world. Acquired intellect, however, is a result of experiences from the material world. The perfect man can exist in either a perfect city or a non-perfect city. However, if a perfect man lives in a non-perfect city, he believes that they are to remain apart from the rest of the society. This is because a non-perfect city is full of weeds. In order for a perfect person to preserve themselves from the weeds, they need to live in solitude despite living in solitude being against human nature.

In addition, Avempace had changed forgotten non-syllogistic arts into “practical arts”, and wrote:&quot;If some of them [the practical arts] employ syllogisms as medicine and agriculture do, they are not called syllogistic because their purpose is not [to convince another] nor to employ syllogisms, but to do some activity.&quot;He wrote nine medical treatises. Galen inscribed commentary on Hippocrates’ Aphorisms in “Commentary on &quot;Aphorisms&quot;” that includes Avempace&#x27;s view about medicine. Medical syllogisms are revolved by means of experience. Experience is obtained in a person&#x27;s life time through perception. Avempace defines experience:&quot;As man&#x27;s reliance on perception to know particular [aspects, &quot;juz’iyyat&quot;] of some matter so that some science results from this perception.Experience is said in general and in particular. If it is said in general, it points out that perception intents knowing particular [aspects] of a matter, from which a universal proposition results. The particular [instances] may take place either by man&#x27;s will or naturally.&quot;Avempace considers experience as the second essential part of medicine. Avempace&#x27;s theoretic system sketched out all reality. Reality comes in many forms that includes motion and action. Avempace categorizes them between natural and artificial. Natural reality forms move bodies with power while bodies within artificial reality forms are unintentionally moved. It also show how the body is viewed.“Art (sina‛a) is the elaborated form abstracted from matter; it is abstracted from its matter. The artificial form which exists in its matter does not have any power to move that which is in it nor to move something else. This is the difference between artificial and natural forms.&quot;This example also represents the use of motion:“If there is a house, there is a foundation by necessity, and this kind of necessity is a relationship between the causes of the existing [object] and the final [cause]. If [the final cause] is described, the various kinds of the causes follow it by necessity, and the form acts in a similar way.If the form is the final [cause] of a motion, motion follows it by necessity, and it is something evident because, if there is building activity, there will be a house, and if there is building, there is the art of construction, but if there is only the art of construction, there will be no building. If [form] is acquired ‘by design,’ the other causes result in an orderly way from the final cause by necessity.”This shows as human involvement is design. Absolute necessity reigns over the heavens. Avempace views necessity into three kinds: absolute, design, and material. Avempace demonstrates the moon eclipses using absolute necessity over time. Based on the relations of the moon eclipses, Avempace indicates “possibility shares necessity”. He defines the body as an artificial collection of matter, which acts as an instrument for the soul to work through. In doing so, he establishes the soul as an autonomous subject. Avempace believes that the human soul has three stages. It starts in the plant stage, then to the animal stage, and finally to human stage. Each stage has an important attribute that the soul grows from. The plant life is where the soul is provided with nourishment and growth. In the animal stage, the soul is introduced to sensations. When the soul moves to the human state, the soul gains common sense, imagination, and memory. Additionally, Avempace writes that the soul is geometrically formless. Because its form is beyond our understanding of geometric shapes, he states, it exists on a plane higher than that which we perceive with our bodies. Avempace is said to have been influenced by Platonic and Aristotelian views on the subject. He credits Plato with the theory of the soul as a substance:&quot;Since it was clear to Plato that the soul is assigned to substance, and that substance is predicated on the form and matter which is body, and that the soul cannot be said to be a body, he fervently defined the soul in its particular aspect. Since he had established that the forms of spheres are souls, he looked for the commonality of all [souls], and found that sense perception is particular to animals, [but] that movement is particular to all, and therefore he defined the soul as “something which moves itself.&quot;

Avempace also describes four types of Intelligible forms. They are described as bodies that have an eternal circular motion, an acquired intellect, those with external senses, and those with internal senses. These ideas are consistent with Aristotle&#x27;s descriptions of the soul and its properties in his treatise &quot;De Anima,&quot; though there is speculation that there were no Arabic transcriptions available to Avempace&quot;.&quot;

Avempace, known as &quot;Ibn al-Sa’igh&quot; by Jewish tradition, is rarely recognized for his philosophical and astronomical works that influenced and were employed by many Medieval Jewish philosophers during and after his short life. The first record of Avempace&#x27;s influence on Jewish philosophy comes from a well-known Jewish contemporary author and philosopher: Judah Halevi. In Chapter 1 of his greatest philosophical work, The Kuzari, Halevi summarizes three ideas directly influenced by works of Ibn Bajja: one&#x27;s unification with the Active Intellect is attainable during their lifetime, this unification implies cognitive identity with others who are aware of the truth, and a philosopher&#x27;s life is a solitary regimen.

The renowned polymath and Jewish philosopher, Maimonides, was possibly born in the same year of Avempace&#x27;s death, yet he preserved and studied the works of the deceased Andalusian. Maimonides admired Avempace for his achievements, stating that &quot;[Ibn Bajja] was a great and wise philosopher, and all of his works are right and correct&quot;. Maimonides also valued Ibn Bajja&#x27;s commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s works on astronomy. In one of his three major works, The Guide for the Perplexed, Maimonides assesses Hebrew Bible theology with Aristotelian philosophy, directly drawing influence from Ibn Bajja philosophical and scientific ideas. Specifically incorporating Avempace&#x27;s philosophies regarding the existence of a single intellect after death, the union of man with the Active Intellect, the division of man into three classes of increasing consciousness, and the proposal of the prophet as an ideal solitary man.

Avempace rejects that feeling ultimate pleasure comes from witnessing the divine world internally. For Avempace, the highest form of spiritual happiness comes from science and the truth. Science allows for the truth to be discovered. As a result, in order to be spiritually healthy and, therefore, happy, we must obtain knowledge and search for the truth.

Despite all the ideas that have been presented by Avempace, a central theory was never actually developed. He attributed this to being a very busy man and having his hands in a variety of a fields.

==Astronomy==
In Islamic astronomy, Maimonides wrote the following on the planetary model proposed by Avempace:

In his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Meteorology&quot;, Avempace presented his own theory on the Milky Way galaxy. Aristotle believed the Milky Way to be caused by &quot;the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars which were large, numerous and close together&quot; and that the &quot;ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the world which is continuous with the heavenly motions.&quot; On the other hand, Aristotle&#x27;s Arabic commentator Ibn al-Bitriq considered &quot;the Milky Way to be a phenomenon exclusively of the heavenly spheres, not of the upper part of the atmosphere&quot; and that the &quot;light of those stars makes a visible patch because they are so close.&quot; Avempace&#x27;s view differed from both, as he considered &quot;the Milky Way to be a phenomenon both of the spheres above the moon and of the sublunar region.&quot; The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy describes his theory and observation on the Milky Way as follows:

Avempace also reported observing &quot;two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun.&quot; In the 13th century, the Maragha astronomer Qotb al-Din Shirazi identified this observation as the transit of Venus and Mercury. However, Avempace cannot have observed a Venus transit, as there were no Venus transits in his lifetime.

Avempace worked under the mathematician Ibn al-Sayyid. He was given the privilege to add a commentary to Ibn al-Sayyid&#x27;s work on geometry and Euclid&#x27;s Elements. Furthermore, he viewed astronomy as part of mathematics. Avempace&#x27;s model of the cosmos consists of concentric circles, but no epicycles.

==Physics==

Averroes was another important philosopher, and while he was born shortly before Avempace&#x27;s death, Averroes later in life would be in opposition to Avempace&#x27;s theories the majority of the time. Avempace starts with a good kinematic definition of motion and construes it as a force. According to Avempace regarding freely falling objects, what is moved as the heavy body falls, is the heavy body and what moves it downward is its &#x27;gravity&#x27; or its &#x27;form&#x27; or &#x27;nature&#x27;.

Text 71 of Averroes&#x27; commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Physics&quot; contains a discussion on Avempace&#x27;s theory of motion, as well as the following quotation from the seventh book of Avempace&#x27;s lost work on physics:

Averroes writes the following comments on Avempace&#x27;s theory of motion:

What follows is also found in Text 71: “This resistance offered to the moving body by the medium does not occur in the way Aristotle has established in the fourth book when he discussed the void. The velocity of a body is not inversely proportional to the density of the medium, but it is the retardation the motion is subject to by virtue of the medium, which is proportional to the density. If what Aristotle said was true, natural motion in a supposed void would not meet any resistance and it would not take time but be instantaneous. Also, the motion of the heavenly spheres, which do not traverse a medium, would occur instantaneously. We see these motions occurring with different finite velocities: the motion of the fixed stars is very slow; the daily motion is very fast. These differences in velocity are due to the fact that the movers of the spheres differ in nobility and the more noble a mover, the faster is the motion of the sphere moved by it.”In relation to the example of the stone falling through the mediums air and water, Avempace also brings up an example of dust particles to explain his ideas on natural movements. Dust particles are suspended in the air and naturally fall slowly. Despite having enough power to go down, it is still insufficient to displace the air underneath it. From Text 71; Ernest A. Moody, who is a notable philosopher, medievalist, and logician, offered four main reasons in favor of the view that Avempace was at least a major thinker within the paradigm of the &quot;Theory of an &#x27;impressed force.&#x27;&quot; The following points are cited from his argument:1. &quot;For Avempace...V = P - M, so that when M = 0, V = P. This opposes Aristotle&#x27;s (supposed use of) V = P / M.&quot;2. &quot;Internal coherence with this &quot;law of motion&quot; requires, Moody believes, also a defense of the theory of an impressed force - as we find for exampled in Philopponus himself.&quot;3. &quot;Avempace&#x27;s appeal to an &#x27;impressed force&#x27; was also reflected in the fact that &#x27;if we use modern terms, it might be said that the force of gravity, for Avempace, is not determined essentially as a relation between the masses of different bodies, but is conceived as an absolute indwelling power of self-motion animating the body like a soul.&quot;4. &quot;The theory of an &#x27;impressed force&#x27; appears to have been upheld by Al-Bitrogi, who was influenced ins ideas by Avempace&#x27;s disciple Ibn-Tofail.&quot;Despite diverging from Aristotle&#x27;s theory of motion, it appears that Avempace largely agrees with Aristotle&#x27;s ideas on projectile motion. While there is no known account that lay&#x27;s out Avempace&#x27;s ideas over this topic, Avempace gives a short explanation in his commentary of Aristotelian Physics book 8. An interesting piece by Avempace on the theory of projectile motion comes from his example involving a magnet and iron filaments. Magnets present a problem with Aristotle&#x27;s theory on projectile motion because nothing can be seen physically moving the iron. Avempace, however, believes that a magnet is more complicated than one might think. He presents the idea that the magnet actually moves the air which, in return, moves the iron.

The central theory of the mover and the moved can be seen not only in his work in physics, but also in his work in Philosophy.

Avempace was a critic of Ptolemy and he worked on creating a new theory of velocity to replace the one theorized by Aristotle. Two future philosophers supported the theories Avempace created, known as the Avempacean dynamics. These philosophers were Thomas Aquinas, a Catholic priest, and John Duns Scotus. Galileo Gallilei went on and adopted Avempace&#x27;s formula and said &quot;that the velocity of a given object is the difference of the motive power of that object and the resistance of the medium of motion&quot; in the Pisan dialogue.

== Botany ==
Avempace is known to have made contributions to the field of botany in addition to philosophy and the physical sciences. His work, titled &quot;Kitab al-nabat (The Book of Plants)&quot; is a commentary influenced by the work &quot;De Plantis&quot;. In this commentary, Avempace discusses the morphology of various plants and attempts to classify them based on their similarities. He also writes about the reproductive nature of plants and their supposed genders based on his observations of palm and fig trees. &quot;Kitab al-nabat&quot; was written in Arabic and has most recently been translated into Spanish.

Avempace&#x27;s book &quot;Kitāb al-Tajribatayn ‘alā Adwiyah Ibn Wāfid (Book of Experiences on Drugs of Ibn Wafid)&quot; is an attempt to classify plants from a pharmacological perspective. It is based the work of Ibn al-Wafid, a physician and Avempace&#x27;s predecessor, and is said to have influenced the later work of Ibn al-Baitar, a prominent Arab pharmacologist and botanist.

Avempace&#x27;s work in botany is evident in his political works.

==Music==
Recently, the web page &quot;Webislam,&quot; created by Spanish converts to Islam, reported that the score of the &quot;Nuba al-Istihlál&quot; of Avempace (11th century), arranged by Omar Metiou and Eduardo Paniagua, is very similar to Marcha Granadera (18th century), which is now the official anthem of Spain. That makes it the world&#x27;s oldest song (about a thousand years old) used for the official anthem of a country.

== Tributes ==
In 2009, a crater 199k km (62 mi) from the South Pole of the Moon was designated The Ibn Bajja crater by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in his honor.

<text>The Baseball Ground was a stadium in Derby, England, that was first used for baseball, as the home of Derby Baseball Club from 1890 until 1898, and then for football, as the home of Derby County from 1895 until 1997. The club&#x27;s reserve and youth sides used it until 2003, when it finally closed as a sports stadium after 113 years (108 of them as a football stadium) and was demolished.

==History==
As the name suggests, the stadium was originally used for baseball. It was originally called Ley&#x27;s Baseball Ground and was part of a complex of sports grounds (Ley&#x27;s Recreation Centre) built and owned by businessman Sir Francis Ley for workers at his foundry, Ley&#x27;s Malleable Castings Vulcan Ironworks. The stadium was the focal point of the complex and was part of a personal quest by Ley to establish professional organised baseball in the United Kingdom. His Ley&#x27;s Recreation Club was formed in 1890 and went on to become known as Derby Baseball Club, prior to being dissolved by Ley and replaced with a new Derby Baseball Club, all in 1890.

The Ground was bordered by Shaftesbury Crescent (west-northwest); Vulcan Street (south-southwest); the Ley foundry (east-southeast); and an extension of Cambridge Street (north-northeast) roughly corresponding to Columbo Street. The original stand was built along Vulcan, with standing-room areas along other edges of the field. The diamond was in roughly the southwest corner of the lot. Over the years, additional stands were built around the pitch and were tagged with names corresponding to their orientation with respect to the streets (Vulcan and Columbo) and nearby neighborhoods (Normanton and Osmaston).

The stadium was home to Derby Baseball Club, the baseball club was running away with the first British professional baseball championship, the National League which was established in 1890. However, pressure from other teams in the league over the number of American players Derby used forced them to resign before the end of the league&#x27;s first season.

Derby County Football Club was formed in 1884, as an offshoot of the Derbyshire County Cricket Club. The football club played on a pitch that was part of the Derby cricket ground, which at that time was in the middle of a racecourse. This site, which had minimal facilities, was chosen to host five FA Cup semi-finals, the replay of the 1886 FA Cup Final and an England international match in 1895. Derby had occasionally used Ley&#x27;s Baseball Ground for their home matches due to horse racing meetings taking priority. With the baseball club in decline, Derby County FC made it their permanent home in 1895 and renamed it The Baseball Ground. A party of Gypsies were forced to move and legend has it that before leaving they put a curse on the ground preventing Derby County winning the FA Cup. The ground became the property of the club in 1924 when it was purchased from Ley&#x27;s heirs for £10,000. The Baseball Ground was once used for an international match: England beat Ireland 2–1 in a British Home Championship match on 11 February 1911.

At its height, the Baseball Ground could accommodate around 42,000 spectators. The record attendance was 41,826 for a match against Tottenham Hotspur in 1969, just after Derby County were promoted under the management of Brian Clough, at the beginning of the most successful era in the club&#x27;s history. Clough guided Derby County to the league title in 1972 and his successor Dave Mackay oversaw another title triumph in 1975.

However, attendances fell at the turn of the 1980s as Derby were relegated from the First Division in 1980, and in 1984 they fell into the Third Division, though an upswing in form followed and they were back in the First Division by 1987. Perimeter fencing was erected between the stands and the pitch during the 1970s to combat pitch invasions by hooligans, but this was dismantled in April 1989, within days of the Hillsborough disaster in which 97 Liverpool fans were fatally injured, most of them crushed to death against perimeter fencing. This resulted in policing levels in games at the Baseball Ground being increased by 50%.

===Closure===
Derby County remained at the stadium until 1997, when they moved to the Pride Park Stadium. The site had first been identified in August 1993, although difficulties with decontaminating the land led to the project being abandoned within 18 months in favour of rebuilding the Baseball Ground into a 26,000-seat stadium. In the meantime, the Baseball Ground had been gradually converted into an all-seater stadium, although its capacity was reduced to just over 18,000 - inadequate for a second-tier club with ambitions of winning promotion back to the top flight.

However, these plans were abandoned in February 1996 and Pride Park was confirmed as the location for a new stadium. Construction work began later in 1996, with the new stadium scheduled to be ready in time for the 1997–98 season. It was, however, confirmed that the Baseball Ground would be retained for reserve and youth team matches for at least a few years after the new stadium&#x27;s completion. Construction of the new stadium began later that year.

The last league match to be played there was a Premier League fixture against Arsenal (where 18,287 people watched Derby lose 3–1, although their top flight status was secured one season after promotion), though the stadium continued to be used for reserve team games for a few seasons afterwards.

In late 2003, several months after the youth team played its final game there, the Baseball Ground was finally demolished to make way for housing. The former ground has since been redeveloped to around 150 new homes and, in September 2010 a commemorative statue was unveiled on the site. The high metalwork featuring the silhouettes of three footballers dribbling and shooting was commissioned by the builders Spirita and Strata and designed by artist Denis O&#x27;Connor. A fan, George Glover, &#x27;made history&#x27; by scoring the last goal at the Baseball Ground in a game between fans.

==Structure and facilities==

After the Taylor Report was published, the stadium was slowly converted to become all-seater from terracing. Consequently, its capacity dropped to 17,451 in the 1995–96 season. This was inadequate for the ambitions of Derby County, who were chasing promotion to the Premier League during the early to mid-1990s, finally achieving it as Division One runners-up in 1996. The stadium featured two 3-tier stands at either end, both with the lowest tier not facing completely straight towards the pitch (due to the previous configuration for baseball) giving a wedge-like appearance at one end. Also, in one corner was a unique stand that was more house-like, mainly for media use.

==Transport==
In 1990, a halt was built to serve the stadium called Ramsline Halt although only four trains ever stopped there.

<text>A floating dock, floating pier or floating jetty is a platform or ramp supported by pontoons. It is usually joined to the shore with a gangway. The pier is usually held in place by vertical poles referred to as pilings, which are embedded in the seafloor or by anchored cables. Frequently used in marinas, this type of pier maintains a fixed vertical relationship to watercraft secured to it, independent of tidal, river or lake elevation. The angle of the gangway varies with the water level.

== Braby pontoon ==
&#x27;Braby pontoon&#x27; was the name given to a type of floating dock used by flying boats in Australia and New Zealand from 1939 to the 1950s. Frederick Braby and Company was a British manufacturer of tanks and silos, Bailey bridges and pontoons. The Braby name was also attached to the general type of pontoon made with ship tanks, whether or not they were manufactured by Frederick Braby and Company. Two 1939 descriptions of a Braby pontoon in Auckland stated:A new type of floating jetty will he used in Auckland for the berthing of the flying-boats. Mr. Turnill stated this morning that this type is known as the &quot;Braby pontoon&quot;, and it has been used previously only at Southampton. It has been well tested there and has been found to be most satisfactory. It consists of two twin sections joined in an arc underneath the water.andShaped like a U, the pontoon resembles a miniature floating dock, and consists of two parallel decks joined by a submerged framework. Tanks give the necessary buoyancy. When the flying-boat has landed, it is warped into position by the ground crew, and is drawn tail-first into the pontoon, coming to rest with the hull between the two sections of decking and above the submerged frame. Inflated buffers on the inner edge of the decking prevent the delicate hull from being damaged.A Braby pontoon constructed at Evans Bay in Wellington, New Zealand in 1951 consisted of 124 large square steel tanks connected together and ballasted with water and oil. The pontoon was U-shaped, long and wide. Flying boats were winched tail-first into the U so that passengers could step onto the pontoon dock.

<doc id="536759" wikidata="Q201612" url="?curid=536759" title="Pride Park Stadium">
<text>Pride Park Stadium is an all-seater football stadium in Derby, England, that is the home ground of English Football League club Derby County. With a capacity of 33,597, it is the 16th-largest football ground in England. Pride Park is a business park on the outskirts of Derby city centre, and the stadium was built as part of the commercial redevelopment of the area in the 1990s. Derby County have played at the ground since it opened in 1997 as a replacement for the Baseball Ground.

Pride Park has hosted two full international matches, England v. Mexico in 2001 and Brazil v. Ukraine in 2010, several England under-21 matches, and the 2009 FA Women&#x27;s Cup final.

==History==
===Planning and development===
Before moving to the Pride Park Stadium, Derby County had played at the Baseball Ground since 1895. Although at its peak the ground had held over 40,000 (the record attendance being 41,826 for a match against Tottenham Hotspur in 1969) the Taylor Report, actioned after the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster had seen the legal requirement for English football stadia to become all-seater by the 1994–95 season resulting in its capacity dwindling to just 17,500 by the mid-1990s, not enough for the then-ambitious second-tier club. An additional problem came with the ground&#x27;s wooden components (considered unacceptable in the wake of the Bradford City stadium fire in 1985) and, in February 1996, chairman Lionel Pickering made the decision to move the club to a new stadium, having originally planned to rebuild the Baseball Ground as a 26,000-seat stadium.

The club originally planned to build a purpose-built 30,000-seat stadium at Pride Park, with 4,000 car parking spaces, a restaurant and conference facilities, a fitness centre, a supporters club and a new training ground. A year later the stadium plan was changed to become part of a £46 million project by the Stadivarios group that would also include a 10,000-seat indoor arena. Peter Gadsby, however, the club&#x27;s associate director at the time and head of the Miller Birch construction company, felt the project was both too ambitious and expensive and instead plans were drawn up by new chairman Lionel Pickering to modernise and extend the Baseball Ground to hold 26,000, at a cost of £10 million. However, despite signing a construction agreement with Taylor Woodrow, Gadsby suggested the club make a second attempt at securing the then-redeveloping Pride Park business park, settling with Derby City Council for a smaller site than previously agreed. On 21 February 1996, prior to a match against Luton Town at The Baseball Ground, the club announced to supporters the decision to move to a £16 million state-of-the-art stadium for the start of the 1997–98 season.

Derby City Council were paid £1.8 million for the land and the club&#x27;s four directors – Lionel Pickering, Peter Gadsby, Stuart Webb and John Kirkland each paid £2.5 million towards a package deal to pay for the stadium. The stadium itself was based upon Middlesbrough&#x27;s Riverside Stadium, which opened in 1995, though it had more than 30 amendments to the original plans. After toying with the idea of naming the new ground &quot;The New Baseball Ground&quot;, it was settled that the club&#x27;s new home would be called The Pride Park Stadium.

===Construction===
Engaging the same architects as Middlesbrough, the Miller Partnership, Derby&#x27;s plans predominantly followed those of the Riverside Stadium, with the first stage being a detached main stand facing a horseshoe running unbroken round the other three sides, with the possibility of the corners being filled in later and the ground&#x27;s capacity being increased if and when necessary by raising the horseshoe roof.

Pickering laid the foundation stone in November 1995 and, after decontamination, the first of the more than 1,000 pre-cast concrete piles was sunk in September 1996. This was followed by 6,500 tonnes of concrete and more than 2,100 tonnes of steelwork as the ground began to take shape. Tapping into the excitement amongst supporters, the club set up a visitors centre which included a computer-generated tour of the stadium taking shape and attracted more than 75,000 fans. The opportunity was also made available for supporters to buy special bricks – on to which they could engrave a message of their choosing – which would be set around the outside of the completed stadium.

The weather of the 1996 winter was not kind to the contractors but extra urgency was provided by the news that the stadium was to be opened by the Queen. This news – the first time the Queen had opened a new football stadium – ensured that the workers, at one point behind schedule, had to pull out all of the stops to get the stadium completed in time. The pitch stood at long and wide, meeting the requirements for an international venue, and measured longer and wider than the pitch at the Baseball Ground. It also came with a grass margin.

===Opening===

The Queen opened the stadium on 18 July 1997 in front of 30,000 spectators. By this time the south west corner, which stood between the main stand and the horseshoe, had been completed. The interest from potential corporate clients had been so high that Pickering pressed the board to go the full distance with the stadium, raising the final initial costs of completing the stadium to £22 million. Work was still in progress on the remaining corner on the opening day, leaving Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh to jokingly ask Taylor Woodrow contract manager Ross Walters, &quot;Haven&#x27;t you been paid yet?&quot; An overture to the opening ceremony came two weeks later, on 4 August 1997, with the first ever game at Pride Park Stadium being played against Italian side Sampdoria, the match ending in a 1–0 defeat with Vincenzo Montella scoring the only goal of the game. The attendance of 29,041 was the highest for a Derby County home game in 20 years. The fixture kicked off a tradition of pre-season friendlies being held against European teams at the ground, with Barcelona (twice), CSKA Moscow, Athletic Bilbao, Lazio, Ajax and Mallorca all visiting the stadium over the next six years.

The first competitive fixture to be completed at the new stadium came on 30 August 1997 and ended in a 1–0 win against Barnsley in front of 27,232, with Stefano Eranio scoring the only goal from the penalty spot. The stadium&#x27;s inaugural competitive fixture against Wimbledon was called off with the score at 2–1 after the floodlights went out in the 11th minute of the second half. Referee Uriah Rennie abandoned the match following a delay of more than half-an-hour while engineers tried unsuccessfully to restart two failed generators. Gadsby said, &quot;We had 11 maintenance people on duty including six electricians but nobody has yet worked out why both generators failed. There was a bang of such strength that it fused them both.&quot; This proved to be the only major problem with the new stadium, which delivered everything which had been promised of it and went on to gain international recognition. Later additions to the ground raised the capacity to 33,597 and a final cost of £28 million.

===Ownership issues===
Although the financing of the stadium&#x27;s construction was carefully structured so that the club paid and owned the ground without encroaching on funds reserved for the development of the team, the club&#x27;s eventual relegation from the top flight in 2002 saw it enter financial crisis and eventually it was temporarily entered into receivership by The Co-operative Bank, who instantly installed a new board composed of John Sleightholme, Jeremy Keith and Steve Harding, for the cost of £1 each. Financial circumstances worsened as the debt spiralled to £30 million plus and an unpopular refinancing scheme was put in place which saw the stadium sold to the &quot;mysterious&quot; Panama-based ABC Corporation and the club paying rent of £1 million a year to play there, which local journalist Gerald Mortimer described as &quot;an affront ... to those who put everything into building [the ground]&quot;. The ownership trio of Sleightholme, Keith and Harding were nicknamed &quot;The Three Amigos&quot; and, after came under increasing criticism from the Derby&#x27;s support, in the form of two separate supporters groups, the RamsTrust and the Rams Protest Group (RPG), they eventually sold out to a group of local businessmen, dubbed &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; by the local press, led by former board member Peter Gadsby, in April 2006. The Gadsby-led consortium returned Pride Park to club ownership. Three years later, Murdo Mackay, Jeremy Keith and finance director Andrew McKenzie were charged with taking a secret commission worth £440,625 from the club and were sentenced to a combined seven-and-a-half years in prison. In August 2009, the club still owed £15 million on the mortgage of the Pride Park Stadium which was later revealed to be due to be paid off in 2016.

===Pride Plaza redevelopment and ground expansion===

 During the 2006–07 season, in which Derby earned promotion back to the Premier League after five years, the club released details of a proposed £20 million development of the area surrounding the stadium, to include the building of a 165-bed hotel, bars, restaurants and office space, to create a local service centre for employers located on the Pride Park business park. Three squares would also be introduced which would be named after legendary figures associated with the club – all-time leading goalscorer Steve Bloomer, the club&#x27;s greatest manager Brian Clough and former chairman Lionel Pickering, who had died in 2006. The club insisted no money would be taken away from the team to pay for the development. On 9 November 2007, Derby City Council approved the plans. Following promotion to the Premier League in the 2006–07 season, the club announced plans to expand the capacity of the stadium up to 44,000 for the start of the 2008–09 season, if the club successfully survived. The plans included adding rows of seats to the north, south and east stands and would have allowed the club to break its current club record attendance. The club, however, failed to maintain its top-flight status and when, in January 2008, it was sold into new American ownership, in the form of General Sports and Entertainment both the plaza plan and the ground expansion initiatives were scrapped.

In 2008, a nine-foot-high bronze statue of Brian Clough and Peter Taylor – who had managed the club between 1967 and 1973 – was commissioned to adorn the north west portion of the ground to be called Unity Plaza. The statue was designed by Andrew Edwards and features both Clough and Taylor holding the League Championship trophy which they won with the club in 1972. It was unveiled on 27 August 2010.

===2018 World Cup and 2012 Olympic bids===
In 2009, Pride Park was earmarked as a possible FIFA World Cup venue when Derby County announced its intention to apply to be one of the host cities as part of England&#x27;s bid for the 2018 World Cup Finals, with Derby chief executive Tom Glick saying, &quot;What we [the board] know is that Derby already has the core elements to be a host city ... We are going to find out what the requirements are but we are certainly expecting that the requirement would be at least 40,000 seats. The ability to do that at Pride Park Stadium exists, the land exists. So we know that if we were successful, that is something that could be done.&quot; To qualify as a host stadium, the ground would need to expand to at least 40,000 capacity and the club announced that three methods could be undertaken to achieve this, two of which would leave the stadium permanently expanded. Option A would see the additional capacity supplied by temporary stands erected behind each goal, removing the current roof, and be supported by steel structures, with all the stands removed after the World Cup and the original roofing replaced. Option B would also see temporary seating built in the north and south stands as well as an additional structure placed on the east stand which the club could choose to keep, increasing the capacity to 39,000. The final Option, C, would see the removal of seating from the north, south and east stands and three new 20 row decks placed in each stand. This again came with the option of retaining the east stand expansion, raising the stadium capacity to a permanent 37,000. The club itself stated that it preferred to explore temporary, rather than permanent, expansion, saying &quot;We&#x27;d like to meet the World Cup standards for matches when it comes to expansion but then perhaps scale down the stadium to something closer to where we are right now. That way, we can keep the intimacy and special atmosphere that has almost become a hallmark of going to a Derby County match. When the team play at home, having a full stadium is a huge advantage because it creates a brilliant atmosphere. What we wouldn&#x27;t want to do is have a stadium that all of a sudden was too big after the World Cup had gone.&quot; On 16 December 2009, Derby&#x27;s campaign was rejected by the FA, along with Hull and Leicester to local rival bid by Nottingham Forest. Tom Glick later commented, &quot;We&#x27;re all greatly disappointed. Thousands of hours of hard work has been put in across the city from a number of agencies. We need to get some feedback as to why the bid was not successful.&quot;

The club was later unsuccessful in its attempt to be the Midlands football venue for the 2012 Summer Olympics, losing out to Coventry City&#x27;s Ricoh Arena, with the selection committee citing the fact the stadium &quot;has fewer dressing rooms and no hotel&quot; in comparison to the Coventry-based stadium.

===Additional ground developments===
On 17 January 2009, a bust of Steve Bloomer was unveiled next to the home dugout.

===The Plaza @ Pride Park development===
On 3 October 2011, Derby County announced that they had submitted plans to Derby City Council for a £7 million development of land outside the stadium, which the club named &quot;The Plaza @ Pride Park&quot;.

These plans included five cafes/restaurants, two convenience stores and 2,000 square metres of office space. These plans had been scaled down from the planned £20 million pound development proposed in 2007. Derby County CEO Tom Glick said that these plans would help the club deal with the new Financial Fair Play regulations which were to be introduced in the Football League from 2012, as revenue from the plaza would be reinvested back into the club.

This planned development also coincided with a plan from the city council to build a multi-use sports arena on the same site as the proposed plaza.

On 12 January 2012, Derby City Council&#x27;s planning control committee gave planning permission for the development. Chief executive Tom Glick said that the club had moved to the next stage of the development, finding a development company to build the plaza.

It was announced on 3 May 2013 that the first phase was to be launched after the last game of the 2012–13 season when Derby County faced Millwall. Located in the north east corner of the stadium and close to the DCFC megastore, the initial phase would provide a mixture of retail and restaurant units totalling 7,000sq.ft. The development was being undertaken jointly by the club and Cedar House Investments, part of former chairman Peter Gadsby&#x27;s Ark Capital group of companies. John Vicars, chief operating officer at Derby County, welcomed the launch by saying, &quot;We see this development attracting perhaps a convenience retailer, and a restaurant to complement the facilities already available on Pride Park and to provide a greater choice. With the opening of the new multi-use sports arena and velodrome adjacent to the club, there will be even greater demand for these facilities.&quot; Peter Gadsby said: &quot;The area is already a proven destination for leading occupiers including Greggs, Frankie &amp; Benny&#x27;s, Subway and Starbucks. I am particularly keen that this scheme will add to the success of Pride Park and provide further amenities for the 10,000 people that are working in the area. It is good news that this phase of the development will create a further 25 jobs.&quot;

A phase two of the plaza will be considered once the velodrome has opened and will add further to the vitality and vibrancy of Pride Park. Derby-based FHP have been appointed as letting agents for the scheme.

===Renaming the stadium===
On 7 December 2013, Pride Park was renamed the iPro Stadium in a £7 million sponsorship deal with global sports drink company iPro. The club announced the cancellation of the sponsorship deal on 18 November 2016, with the stadium&#x27;s name reverting to Pride Park.

==Records ==
The highest attendance at Pride Park for a competitive Derby County match is 33,378 in the Premier League against Liverpool on 18 March 2000.

In a testimonial for Ted McMinn, on 1 May 2006, former players of both Derby County and Rangers contested a match at Derby County&#x27;s Pride Park Stadium in which a record 33,475 spectators attended – around 10,000 of them being Rangers fans.

Notes
==Non-Derby County matches==
As one of the largest football grounds in the Midlands, Pride Park has also hosted some notable matches not connected to Derby County.

Pride Park has hosted one full England international: a 4–0 friendly victory over Mexico on 25 May 2001, when the national side toured the country during the building of the new Wembley Stadium. The match also holds the record for the highest attendance at the stadium: a full-house of 33,597.

The ground has hosted six England U21 matches. The results were as follows;
Partly as a result of Derby&#x27;s successful hosting of international U21 football, Pride Park was selected as a host venue as part of the English bid to host the 2013 European U21s Championship.

Away from the England national side, the stadium hosted a friendly between Brazil and Ukraine on 11 October 2010. The match ended in a 2–0 victory for Brazil, with Dani Alves and Alexandre Pato scoring the goals, in front of a crowd of 13,088 live spectators and TV viewers in over 100 countries. Though Brazil coach Mano Menezes bemoaned the low turnout (&quot;I expected more fans but I think it was a good game&quot;), Derby chief executive Tom Glick declared himself relatively pleased with the turnout, saying &quot;I think everybody was hoping that we&#x27;d have a sold out crowd of over 30,000 but, realistically, time was working against us. We only had 13 days to sell the tickets and a big crowd just wasn&#x27;t on the cards. But I think we&#x27;ve proven that we can turn it around, operationally. The promoter, Kentaro, has seen that. So we have done ourselves a favour in terms of bringing something else like this back again and we will continue to pursue things like this.&quot;

Away from international football, on 4 May 2009 Pride Park hosted the 39th FA Women&#x27;s Cup Final, which saw Arsenal run out 2–1 victors over Sunderland to win the cup for a record fourth consecutive time, in front of a crowd of 23,291.

==Notable non-football events==

Although primarily a football venue, Pride Park Stadium has also hosted events away from sport. It first hosted singer Rod Stewart on 26 June 2005 while touring his &quot;&quot; album. This was followed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who played at the ground as part of the tour for their &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; album on 5 June 2006. Monster Jam came to Pride Park Stadium on 28 and 29 May 2011.

<doc id="536762" wikidata="Q27243" url="?curid=536762" title="Northeast Asia">
<text>Northeast Asia or Northeastern Asia is a geographical subregion of Asia. Its northeastern landmass and islands are bounded by the North Pacific Ocean.

The term Northeast Asia was popularized during the 1930s by American historian and political scientist Robert Kerner. Under Kerner&#x27;s definition, &quot;Northeast Asia&quot; includes the Japanese Archipelago, the Korean Peninsula, the Mongolian Plateau, the Northeast China Plain, and the mountainous regions of the Russian Far East, stretching from the Lena River in the west to the Pacific Ocean in the east.

==Definitions==
The definition of Northeast Asia is not static but often changes according to the context in which it is discussed.

The subregion of Northeast Asia comprises China, Japan, and Korea, usually also including Mongolia and Siberia. Parts or the whole of northern China are also frequently included in sources. The Economic Research Institute for Northeast Asia defines the region as China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Russia.

Prominent cities in this area include Busan, Changchun, Dalian, Harbin, Hiroshima, Incheon, Khabarovsk, Kitakyushu, Kobe, Kyoto, Nagasaki, Nagoya, Osaka, Pyongyang, Sapporo, Seoul, Shenyang, Tokyo, Ulaanbaatar, Vladivostok, and Yokohama.

==Economy==


Northeast Asia is one of the most important economic regions of the world, accounting for 25.3% of the world&#x27;s nominal GDP in 2019, which is slightly larger than the United States. It is also one of the major political centers and has significant influence on international relations. By the end of the 1990s, Northeast Asia had a share of 12% of the global energy consumption, with a strong increasing trend. By 2030, the major economic growth in the region is expected to double or triple this share.

==Biogeography==
In biogeography, Northeast Asia generally refers roughly to the area spanning the Japanese Archipelago, the Korean Peninsula, Northeast China, and the Russian Far East between Lake Baikal in southern Siberia and the Pacific Ocean.

Northeast Asia is mainly covered by temperate forest, taiga, and the Eurasian Steppe, while tundra is found in the region&#x27;s far north. Summer and winter temperatures are highly contrasted. It is also a mountainous area.

<text>Michael Joseph Pennington (born 5 September 1970), better known as Johnny Vegas, is an English actor, comedian, director and writer. He is known for his thick Lancashire accent, husky voice, angry comedic rants, and use of surreal humour.

Vegas&#x27; television roles have included Moz in the BBC Three dark comedy &quot;Ideal&quot; (2005–2011), Geoff Maltby (&quot;The Oracle&quot;) in the ITV sitcom &quot;Benidorm&quot; (2007–2009, 2015–2017), and Eric Agnew in the BBC One sitcom &quot;Still Open All Hours&quot; (2013–2019). He has also been a regular guest panellist on the television comedy panel shows &quot;QI&quot; and &quot;8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown&quot;.

==Early life==
Vegas was born Michael Joseph Pennington on 5 September 1970, in the Thatto Heath area of St Helens, Lancashire. He has an older sister and two older brothers; they were all brought up as Roman Catholic. At the age of 11, he attended the boarding school and seminary St Joseph&#x27;s College in Up Holland to train for the priesthood, but came back homesick after four terms.

Vegas earned a BA in Art and Ceramics from Middlesex University in London. He then returned to his home town and took various odd jobs; he worked in an Argos warehouse, sold boiler insurance door-to-door, packed bottles of Cif in a factory, and was a barman at a local pub. Between 1994 and 1997, he was a member of Cluub Zarathustra, a comedy performance group led by Stewart Lee, Roger Mann, and Simon Munnery.

==Career==
===Television and radio===
In 1996, Vegas made his television debut as a contestant on &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot; in the UK under his real name, but made references to the fact he wanted to be a comedian and that his stage name was &quot;Johnny Vegas&quot;.

Vegas gained a wider audience as a regular member of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;. His character was a pitiable sort always nursing a pint of Guinness. In 2001 he appeared on the &quot;Weakest Link&quot;, in a comedians special and beat Barry Cryer to win the jackpot of £10,200.

In 2002, Vegas starred in the BBC Radio 4 sitcom &quot;Night Class&quot;, which he co-wrote with Tony Burgess and Tony Pitts, with Dirk Maggs as director.

In December 2016 it was announced that &quot;Home From Home&quot; had been commissioned for a full series to air on BBC One in 2018.

Beginning in September 2019, Vegas has starred as the voice of the title character in the surreal children&#x27;s animated series &quot;The Rubbish World of Dave Spud&quot;.

In 2004, he played Dave in the film &quot;Sex Lives of the Potato Men&quot; and voiced Uncle Stewart in the film &quot;Terkel in Trouble&quot;. In 2013, Vegas was the voice of Abu the hamster in the British film &quot;The Harry Hill Movie&quot;.

Vegas provided the voice for Asbo in the 2018 Aardman Animations film &quot;Early Man&quot;.

===Other projects===
Vegas appeared in Joe Orton&#x27;s &quot;The Erpingham Camp&quot; at the 2000 Edinburgh Festival. In 2001, Vegas starred as Al in adverts for ITV Digital with a puppet named Monkey (voiced by Ben Miller). In 2007, he reprised the role in adverts for PG Tips tea.

Having achieved fame in entertainment, Vegas received plaudits for his ceramic work. &quot;Ceramic Review&quot; praised him, leading to a role in &quot;Pot Shots&quot; (collaborating with Roger Law), a film made for an international gathering of potters. This led to his work being acquired for a collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum and a commission from Old Spice to design a bottle for their aftershave.

In 2014, he directed a music video for Paul Heaton and Jacqui Abbott. That year he also published his autobiography.

In May 2017, it was announced Vegas would be starring in new comedy feature &quot;Eaten by Lions&quot; opposite Antonio Aakeel and Jack Carroll, directed by Jason Wingard.

==Personal life==
In August 2002, Vegas married Catherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Donnelly. In a satire of celebrities selling exclusive pictures of their weddings to publications for high prices, he sold pictures of the ceremony to the adult comic &quot;Viz&quot; for £1. They separated in late-2006 and divorced in 2008. They had one child together. In April 2011, he married Irish television presenter Maïa Dunphy in Seville. In January 2015, they announced that they were expecting their first child together. They separated in late-2017, reconciled in November 2018, and separated again some time before April 2020.

Vegas continues to live in his home town of St Helens, and has been outspoken about the pride he takes in it; he is well known for being active in supporting the local community. He fulfilled a lifetime ambition by appearing for St Helens RFC in Keiron Cunningham&#x27;s testimonial rugby league game, a friendly against Hull FC, in 2005.

In December 2012, Vegas said that he had recently returned to the Roman Catholic faith in which his parents brought him up and credited the faith for his good upbringing.

In July 2014, Vegas was made an Honorary Doctor of Literature (HonDLitt) by Edge Hill University.

Vegas is a supporter of the Labour Party and has spoken about his appreciation for the NHS.

<doc id="536770" wikidata="Q4863557" url="?curid=536770" title="Barrie School">
<text>Barrie School is a progressive independent school for students age 12 months through Grade 12 located in an unincorporated area of Montgomery County, Maryland, outside of Washington, D.C. The school is within the Glenmont census designated place, has a Silver Spring postal address, and is in close proximity to Layhill. Barrie School is a nonprofit school with 501(c)(3) status.

Barrie School has three divisions located on the same campus. The Lower School, which serves children from age 12 months through fifth grade, is Montessori-based. The Middle and Upper School uses a project-based curriculum. The campus has several buildings, a pool, and two ponds. Barrie School&#x27;s equestrian program closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the horses and ponies were re-homed.

==History==
===Founding in Mount Pleasant===
The school was founded in 1932 by Frances Littman Seldin as a preschool called the Peter Pan School, located at 1604 Park Road NW in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of the District of Columbia. A native of New York, Seldin was a graduate of Columbia University and a member of the Naturalist Hiking Club.

===Move to Takoma===
The school moved to 801 Fern Street NW in the Takoma neighborhood in 1939. A zoning variance to establish a school in the residential neighborhood, which was opposed by the Takoma Park Citizens Association, was granted by the District of Columbia Board of Zoning Adjustment. The new location was a urban campus. The name was changed to Barrie School when upper grade classes were added, memorializing author J. M. Barrie, creator of the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; story.

Barrie was described by Mrs. Seldin as a progressive country day school, directly influenced by the work of John Dewey, Maria Montessori, Alfred Adler, and Anna Freud. It was an anomaly among private schools in Washington, D.C., for much of its history because of Mrs. Seldin&#x27;s then-controversial beliefs about integration, creating a socioeconomically diverse population, and her decision to offer a year-round program and extended hours to serve working parents. Although the name Montessori was rarely used in describing Barrie School during those years, the program was heavily influenced by Maria Montessori&#x27;s philosophy and program, including practical life, integrated learning and project-based collaborative learning, multiple age class groups, and a culture of partnership between students, parents, and staff.

===Move to Montgomery County===
In the 1950s, Mrs. Seldin purchased a country estate on Layhill Road in rural Montgomery County, Maryland. The school began operating there in 1958. The new site was added to continue the school&#x27;s mission of teaching in a natural setting. Barrie Camp moved to the property. In 1976, the Fern Place campus was closed and the remaining Middle and Lower School classes were moved to the Layhill Road property, with room for 265 students.

The Upper School (Grades 9–12) was closed from 1974 through 1982 as a result of Ms. Seldin&#x27;s death and the need to sell the Fern Place campus to cover estate taxes, and a building moratorium imposed on new construction in Montgomery County during that period that created a cap on enrollment at the Layhill Road campus.

The high school was reopened in 1982 in time for the 50th anniversary of Barrie School&#x27;s founding, which was celebrated with the reopening of the Upper School in the former Argyle Junior High School building on Bel Pre Road. That year, Barrie&#x27;s Upper School was formally recognized by the American Montessori Society as the first Montessori High School in the United States. In that year the Barrie Institute for Advanced Montessori Studies was authorized by the American Montessori Society and Maryland State Commission of Higher Education to offer the first formal teacher preparation for secondary Montessori educators (ages 12–18).

Classes were held until new buildings on the Layhill Road campus were completed in the summer of 1991, bringing the Primary, Lower and Upper Elementary, Middle, and Upper School students together on one campus again.

===Barrie Institute for Advanced Montessori Studies===
In 1980, the Barrie Institute for Advanced Montessori Studies, offering graduate-level teacher education programs, was founded on Barrie School&#x27;s Layhill Road campus to provide bridge between the traditional and Montessori schools of education. The training programs have been completed by individuals from the United States, Canada, Trinidad, China, and South Korea.

<doc id="536773" wikidata="Q331795" url="?curid=536773" title="Patrol boat">
<text>A patrol boat (also referred to as a patrol craft, patrol ship, or patrol vessel) is a relatively small naval vessel generally designed for coastal defence, border security, or law enforcement. There are many designs for patrol boats, and they generally range in size. They may be operated by a nation&#x27;s navy, coast guard, police, or customs, and may be intended for marine (&quot;blue water&quot;), estuarine (&quot;green water&quot;), or river (&quot;brown water&quot;) environments.

Per their name, patrol boats are primarily used to patrol a country&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), but they may also be used in other roles, such as anti-smuggling, anti-piracy, fishery patrols, immigration law enforcement, or search and rescue. Depending on the size, organization, and capabilities of a nation&#x27;s armed forces, the importance of patrol boats may range from minor support vessels that are part of a coast guard, to flagships that make up a majority of a navy&#x27;s fleet. Their small size and relatively low cost make them one of the most common naval vessels in the world.

There exist following sort of patrol boats: patrol boat fast (PBF), patrol boat with surface-to-surface missile (PBG), patrol boat inshore (PBI), patrol boat with SAM (PBM), patrol boat riverine (PBR), patrol boat with torpedo (PBT).

==Classification==

The classification of a patrol boat is often subjective, but they are generally small naval vessels that are used to patrol national waters or a certain jurisdiction. They may be as large as a corvette or even a frigate, though the term may also be used for vessels as small as a yacht or rigid inflatable boat. They can include fast attack craft, torpedo boats, and missile boats. They may be broadly classified as inshore patrol vessels (IPVs) or offshore patrol vessels (OPVs). OPVs and medium size cutters are usually the smallest ship in a navy&#x27;s fleet that are large and seaworthy enough to patrol off-shore in the open ocean, while IPVs are typically too small to do so and are instead kept in lakes or rivers, or close to coasts; IPVs specifically used in rivers can also be called &quot;riverine patrol vessels&quot;. Large patrol vessels, Heavy patrol vessels and Large cutters are the largest type of patrol ships and are typically more than 100 m (330 ft) in length.

Seagoing patrol boats are typically around 30 m (100 ft) in length and usually carry a single medium caliber artillery gun as main armament, and a variety of lighter secondary armament such as machine guns, while others include the sophisticated close-in weapon system. Depending on their role, vessels in this class may also have more sophisticated sensors and fire control systems that would enable them to carry torpedoes, anti-ship missiles, and surface-to-air missiles.

==History==
During both World Wars, in order to rapidly build up numbers, all sides created auxiliary patrol boats by arming motorboats and seagoing fishing trawlers with machine guns and obsolete naval weapons. Some modern patrol vessels are still based on fishing and leisure boats.

The United States Navy operated the of armed hydrofoils for years in a patrol boat role. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. Navy ordered 193 aluminum hulled Patrol Craft, Fast (PCFs), also known as &quot;Swiftboats&quot;, for brown water naval operations. The Patrol Boat, River (PBR, sometimes called &quot;Riverine&quot; and &quot;Pibber&quot;) was a fiberglass hulled vessel also designed and used for inland river operations during the Vietnam War, and became an icon of water operations during the war due to its use in the 1979 film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.

Most modern designs are powered by gas turbine arrangements such as CODAG, and speeds are generally in the range. The largest OPVs might also have a flight deck and helicopter embarked. In times of crisis or war, these vessels are expected to support the larger vessels in a navy, though some smaller navies are mostly composed of just patrol boats.

<text>Santa Fe University of Art and Design (SFUAD) was a private for-profit art school in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The university was built from the non-profit College of Santa Fe (CSF), a Catholic facility founded as St. Michael&#x27;s College in 1859, and renamed the College of Santa Fe in 1966. After financial difficulties in 2009, the college closed and the campus was purchased by the City of Santa Fe, the State of New Mexico, and Laureate Education, and reopened with a narrowed focus on film, theater, graphic design, and fine arts. As Santa Fe University of Art and Design it became a secular college of 950 students. The university closed in May 2018 due to significant ongoing financial challenges.

==History==

St. Michael&#x27;s College was established at the behest of Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy, who had arrived in New Mexico in 1851 to find that formal schooling in the territory was nonexistent. After establishing the Loretto Academy for girls in 1852, Lamy recruited the De La Salle Christian Brothers to open a similar school for boys, and St. Michael&#x27;s held its first classes in the fall of 1859. In the 1870s, the school appointed a new leader, Brother Botulph, who oversaw its growth into an institution of higher learning. Under Botulph, St. Michael&#x27;s began offering high school diplomas, and later, teaching certificates. In 1874 it received a charter from the territorial legislature, making it the oldest chartered college in New Mexico. In 1878, the school completed a new main building which still stands in altered form on Old Santa Fe Trail.
Eventually, with different types of educational institutions becoming more sharply delineated, St. Michael&#x27;s phased out its post-secondary courses by the end of World War I to operate strictly as St. Michael&#x27;s High School. However, in the 1940s, the school&#x27;s former principal Brother Benildus of Mary decided to re-establish St. Michael&#x27;s College as an institution of higher learning. In 1944 he launched a fundraiser to build a new college on the existing campus which fell short of the goal. However, he got a second chance when the former Bruns Army General Hospital on Cerrillos Road was declared surplus property at the end of World War II. In 1947, Benildus managed to secure a portion of the hospital complex totaling and 39 semi-permanent wooden buildings for the new college, which was ready to begin classes in the fall. By 1949 the college had over 200 students, and in 1961 it completed its first permanent building, Brother Benildus Hall.

In 1966, the Christian Brothers changed the name of the school to the College of Santa Fe.

In February 2009, the College of Santa Fe declared a state of financial emergency. Attempts to merge with Highlands University faltered due to funding concerns, and the school nearly closed. In September 2009, a public-private partnership that included the City of Santa Fe, the New Mexico State Governor&#x27;s Office and Laureate Education (a for-profit corporation) purchased the campus, reopening the school as The College of Santa Fe, under different leadership.

The name changed to Santa Fe University of Art and Design on August 30, 2010 after the school decided to narrow its focus on art and design. There is no longer an affiliation with the Lasallian Brothers or the alumni of College of Santa Fe.

On May 18, 2016 the school announced that it would be acquired by Raffles Education, a Singapore-based private company. However, the deal fell through, leaving ownership of the school with Laureate Education. Citing &quot;significant ongoing financial challenges,&quot; the university closed after the 2017-2018 school year.

==Campus==

The Santa Fe University of Art and Design was housed on 60-acres. Approximately 70% of its student body lived in college-owned housing.

===Facilities===
The campus is the location of the Greer Garson Theatre Center, which includes the Weckesser Studio Theatre, a black-box performance space, a dance studio, the Claire Stewart Williamson Acting Lab, practice rooms and costume shops.
The Visual Arts Center houses the art and photography departments. The facility is a series of interconnected buildings designed by Ricardo Legorreta.

Garson Studios is a 27,000-square-foot motion picture soundstage facility connected to the university&#x27;s Film School. It has the largest permanent green screen in the state of New Mexico. The facility was founded in 1989 by actress and College of Santa Fe patron Greer Garson. According to the school, Garson Studios has been the filming location of over 30 films, which collectively have been nominated for 20 Academy Awards, with 5 wins. Students from all programs are eligible to intern on films produced at Garson Studios.

<doc id="536779" wikidata="Q1585470" url="?curid=536779" title="Orpheus (role-playing game)">
<text>Orpheus is a tabletop role playing game by White Wolf Publishing, set in a microcosm of the World of Darkness. Unlike the other World of Darkness game lines, &quot;Orpheus&quot; has a specifically planned metaplot and a set number of books that were published. Although it uses the same system as White Wolf&#x27;s other games, ghosts and spirits are the exclusive focus of this story. Other supernatural creatures in the World of Darkness are strongly discouraged from entering the events of &quot;Orpheus&quot;. It is, however, tied with &quot;&quot;, White Wolf&#x27;s previous game dealing with the afterlife; some of the events in &quot;Orpheus&quot; are related to &quot;Ends of Empire&quot;, the final book in the &quot;Wraith: The Oblivion&quot; line.

==Volumes==
There are six books in total in the &quot;Orpheus&quot; line; the first is the main rulebook, which holds the rules used throughout the series. The five that follow carry out a specific, albeit optional, plotline, told through fiction and roleplaying, as well as expanding on the roleplaying tools presented in the first game. They are, in chronological order:
&quot;Orpheus&quot; is noteworthy in that it began the trend of White Wolf creating game series with limited numbers of supplements. This concept continued on with the Chronicles of Darkness games &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, all of which were initially planned as limited releases.

There also was an anthology based on &quot;Orpheus&quot; named &quot;Orpheus: Haunting the Dead&quot; (WW11905 / ).

==Character types==
Characters in &quot;Orpheus&quot; are either living individuals capable of astral projection (via meditation or cryonics) or are ghosts of the recently deceased. It is assumed that characters work for the Orpheus Group, a company that employs the talents of &quot;projectors&quot; and &quot;spirits&quot; to investigate and clear ghostly activity and perform other tasks difficult for those without access to the world of the dead. The way a person manifests as a ghost is called the &quot;Lament&quot;; two Laments are projection-based, while two are based on a person being dead.

* Skimmers use drugs and meditative techniques to temporarily eject their souls from their bodies. While they can enter and exit the spirit world quickly, their close connection to their empty shells means damage they take as a ghost manifests on their bodies.
* Sleepers are cryonically frozen; once the body reaches a certain temperature, it is &quot;dead&quot; and ejects the spirit. While in stasis, the body is treated with special drugs to keep necrosis from setting in. While it keeps sleepers from the close connections skimmers have that allows them to be injured, the process means that both entering and leaving the world of ghosts is a slow process.
* Spirits are your run-of-the-mill dead person, souls who have unfinished businesses that allow them to remain on earth. Most who work for Orpheus have a high degree of independence because of a remarkable willpower they held in life that transitions to death; not all spirits, however, are able to keep their independent attitudes when they die and become doomed to repeat themselves endlessly.
* Hues are spirits with one major difference; while alive, they took the designer drug &quot;pigment&quot;. Pigment keeps a spirit from feeling ultimately fulfilled, so while a hue may be as stubborn as a spirit, they have more fragile forms and are closer to their dark sides.

Each character has a set of special traits, called a &quot;Shade&quot;, which determine how they manifest and what ghostly powers (or &quot;Horrors&quot;) they are able to use and which ones they cannot. There are eight Shades in total; the first five were introduced in the &quot;Orpheus&quot; corebook, while the remaining three were introduced in three of the supplements.

* Banshees are the empathetic shades, full of compassion. They manifest their abilities of emotional manipulation, physical damage, and looking into the future through their voices.
* Haunters are those who care for things over people. This focus allows them to manipulate inanimate objects and machines to a disturbing degree.
* Poltergeists are usually full of rage, either quiet or overt. This allows them to pick up objects without touching them directly, and also to alter their own forms in violent ways.
* Skinriders are control freaks. They are granted the ability to possess the bodies of others and bend them to their will.
* Wisps are the trickster shade. They have abilities that allow them to draw attention, escape in a flash, or manipulate ghostly items.
* Phantasms, introduced in &quot;Shades of Gray&quot;, are the artists and dreamers. They can see and manipulate the dreams of the living.
* Orphan-Grinders, introduced in &quot;The Orphan-Grinders&quot;, are ghosts who gave in to their dark sides, and then came back. They can use the abilities of the dark ghosts, or Spectres.
* Marrow, introduced in &quot;End Game&quot;, can adapt to any situation. Appropriately, they are shapeshifters and also have a rapport with animals.

==Antagonists==
Along with ghosts as antagonists, there are also rival projection companies, such as Terrel and Squib, and a new designer drug called &quot;pigment&quot; or &quot;black heroin&quot; that allows users to see the spirits of the dead. There are also dark spirits called Spectres, some of which are corrupted spirits and hues, and others that have spawned from an unknown but powerful source. These create much of the storyline and challenges the players must face as they move through the series.

<doc id="536780" wikidata="Q7276979" url="?curid=536780" title="RMAS Typhoon (A95)">
<text>RMAS &quot;Typhoon&quot; (A95) was an ocean-going tug of the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service (RMAS). She was designed for ocean towing, rescue, salvage and fire-fighting. She was the first ship to leave the United Kingdom ahead of the task force for the South Atlantic during the 1982 Falklands War. She had a fishery protection role in the Cod Wars.

==History==

The ship was repaired at Falmouth ship repair yard on 19 October 1979, and was also involved in the rescue of the Spanish butane tanker, MV Butaseis, which was aflame and drifting towards the village of Brixton, Devon. The tug stayed as part of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary until included in the RMAS.

&quot;Typhoon&quot; saw service in the Falklands War from leaving the UK on 4 April 1982 until 20 July 1982 under Captain J N Morris with an all-civilian crew from Portland Naval Base. She also carried 2 Royal Naval Personnel, 1 for comms and 1 medic; they had the distinction of being first to leave and returned home 24 September 1982 as did HMS Hydra docking in last that day 24 September 1982 in Portsmouth.
Captain Morris and his civilian crew flew back from Port Stanley when Capt Stephens and the relief crew arrived in Port Stanley 20 July 1982. Under the command of Captain Bruce Stephens she returned to Portland with her new civilian crew. The 2 Royal Navy Crew remained on board until the vessel docked on 24 September 1982. She was the first ship – albeit a civilian vessel – to leave the UK ahead of the task force, and a member of the crew, the tug&#x27;s bosun, placed the Welsh flag on board RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; just before &quot;Typhoon&quot; towed her out to sea to be scuttled by a submarine. During the war, the ship was heavily involved in logistic duties, transferring fresh water to the task force at a rate of 18 tons per trip, and loading part of 17 Brigade onto the MV Norland in preparation for the San Carlos landings. The ship was sold in 1989 and later converted into a trawler in 1992.

<text>Mitsou Annie Marie Gélinas (born September 1, 1970, in Loretteville, Quebec) is a Canadian pop singer, businesswoman, television and radio host, and actress. She is credited as Mitsou Gélinas when acting, but records simply as Mitsou (the French spelling of &quot;Mitsu&quot;, which means honey in Japanese).

==Biography==
Born in Loretteville, Quebec, Mitsou is the granddaughter of Quebec actor and playwright Gratien Gélinas. She got involved in acting and modelling as a child notably in the French-Canadian soap opera &quot;Terre humaine&quot;, but also began to pursue singing in her teenage years.

In 1988, she signed with Canadian independent Isba Records and released her first single, &quot;Bye Bye Mon Cowboy&quot; (composed and produced by Jean-Pierre Isaac), which became a pop hit across Canada, an extremely rare feat for a francophone song, in 1989. Later that year, she followed with her debut, multicultural-themed album, &quot;El Mundo&quot; which also spawned the singles &quot;La Corrida&quot; and &quot;Les Chinois&quot;.

In 1990, she released her follow-up album, &quot;Terre des hommes&quot;. Ivan Doroschuk of Men Without Hats wrote the title track, in addition to her first English-language song &quot;A Funny Place (The World Is)&quot;. The first single, &quot;Mademoiselle Anne&quot;, failed to replicate her cross-Canada success, but in 1991 the second single, &quot;Dis-moi, dis-moi&quot;, put Mitsou back in the spotlight with a controversial video that showed her and several male and female models nude in a shower room.

The video, which was released only a few months after Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Justify My Love&quot;, was banned from regular rotation by MuchMusic as the Madonna video had been – technically, the video was not fully banned from the network, as the programming committee ruled that the late-night program &quot;City Limits&quot; was allowed to play it, but as a mainstream pop song incompatible with the show&#x27;s alternative rock format, the program refused to do so.

Notably, the video for &quot;Dis-moi, dis-moi&quot; was not banned on Much&#x27;s French-language sister station MusiquePlus, but in fact was placed in heavy rotation; Mitsou&#x27;s manager Pierre Gendron attributed the difference to English Canada being more prudish than French Canada.

Having banned two high-profile pop videos within a few months of each other, MuchMusic created a new occasional late-night series, &quot;Too Much 4 Much&quot;, on which they would play banned videos along with forum and panel discussions on the controversies these videos raised. Due to the controversy, Mitsou&#x27;s single was played across Canada even though the lyrics (which Mitsou co-wrote) were exclusively in French.

Her 1992 follow-up EP, &quot;Heading West&quot;, was a collection of past hits and new material in English and French. Despite a title track co-written by Cyndi Lauper, and the radio and video play given the dance-driven single &quot;Deep Kiss&quot;, it failed to generate a substantial pop hit. In 1993, she followed it up with her first full-English album &quot;Tempted&quot;. Although the lead single was written by RuPaul (&quot;Everybody Say Love&quot;), the album again failed to give her a significant hit. The video for &quot;Everybody Say Love&quot; featured nudity (as well as homosexuality) but failed to stir any media attention.

Subsequently, she returned to recording primarily French-language material for her 1994 album &quot;Ya Ya&quot; (with the track &quot;Ya Ya&quot; a Lee Dorsey cover) which included cover versions of songs popular in Quebec in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, such as the title track and &quot;Comme j&#x27;ai toujours envie d&#x27;aimer&quot; (a Marc Hamilton cover). She also released a Christmas album entitled &quot;Noel&quot; in 1995 that included some Quebec holiday classics.

After a hiatus, her next album, &quot;Mitsou (Éponyme)&quot; (1999), featured hip-hop-influenced beats and a street-oriented rock sound. She also co-wrote and co-produced all the tracks. A club-oriented EP &quot;Vibe&quot; followed in 2002. It features remixes of previous material such as &quot;Bye Bye Mon Cowboy&quot; (which was re-recorded and released as a single) and &quot;Money Penny&quot;.

Mitsou acted in a number of Quebec films, most recently in Denys Arcand&#x27;s Academy Award-winning &quot;Les invasions barbares&quot;. She was top billed in 1992&#x27;s &quot;Coyote&quot;, which was a major release in Quebec (released during her popularity as a singer, she was billed as simply Mitsou for this release). She wrote the song &quot;Le Toucher&quot; for the film &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;.

In 2000, Mitsou joined &quot;C&#x27;t’encore drôle&quot;, the morning show on Énergie 94.3 FM in Montreal. She was an instant hit, as evidenced by the show&#x27;s high ratings and enormous popularity with 18- to 34-year-olds who have made it the number one morning show for 10 years straight. By June 15, 2012, Mitsou left the morning show of the station after 12 years. On August 20, 2012, Gélinas revealed that she signed on to join the rival CFGL-FM as the drive home co-host but won&#x27;t begin her duties until November.

Since 2001, she has been the editor of a Quebec magazine for young women, &quot;Clin d&#x27;oeil&quot;. In 2005, she hosted the show &quot;Au Courant&quot; on CBC Newsworld, an English-language program that focuses on &quot;what&#x27;s hot and happening in French Canada.&quot;

In February 2009, it was announced that Mitsou would become the &quot;beauty ambassador&quot; for Lise Watier, a Canadian-based cosmetics and skincare product line, and would subsequently appear in the company&#x27;s advertising campaigns.

In 2009, she hosted &quot;Comment va ta famille?&quot;, a documentary series that portrays the state of the family in Quebec in 2008–09, and television magazine &quot;La liste&quot;, produced by Marie-France Bazzo for ARTV. She also joined the cast of &quot;The Child Prodigy (L&#x27;Enfant prodige)&quot;, a movie about pianist André Mathieu, in which she played Vivianne Jobin, one of Mathieu&#x27;s mistresses.

In fall 2009, she began serving as a presenter for the TV program &quot;Kampaï! À votre santé&quot;, a show on healthy cooking and dining, for Radio-Canada.

In August 2010, Mitsou married her partner of 15 years, Iohann Martin, in a &quot;surprise wedding&quot; that he had organized without her knowledge for her 40th birthday. They are the parents of two daughters.

Mitsou will begin releasing new singles via her website as the inspiration strikes her. The first of these is a collaboration between Mitsou and Creature entitle &quot;On vole&quot;, and was released in 2011.

In 2021 she appeared as a guest judge in a second season episode of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. Her 1993 single &quot;Everybody Say Love&quot;, originally written by RuPaul, was used as the Lip Sync for Your Life number.

<doc id="536787" wikidata="Q1564445" url="?curid=536787" title="HMS Bristol (D23)">
<text>HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; (D23) was a Type 82 destroyer, the only vessel of her class to be built for the Royal Navy. &quot;Bristol&quot; was intended to be the first of a class of large destroyers to escort the CVA-01 aircraft carriers projected to come into service in the early 1970s but the rest of the class and the CVA-01 carriers were cancelled as a result of the 1966 Defence White Paper which cut defence spending.

Following a long career which included the Falklands War, she was converted into a training ship in 1987. In 1991 while part of the Dartmouth training squadron, she suffered a boiler explosion that damaged the vessel beyond economical repair. No longer having enough value to be sold to another navy, she became a Harbour Training ship at HMS Excellent. She was decommissioned in Portsmouth on 28 October 2020.

==Origin==
The CVA-01 fleet aircraft carrier was designed to replace the World War II vintage aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy. The first plans were for two carriers and to protect these carriers four new Type 82 area air defence destroyers were to be built. In 1963, the Minister of Defence Peter Thorneycroft, announced in Parliament that one new aircraft carrier would be built, at an estimated cost of £56 million. However, a change of government and competition from the RAF (the RAF and Navy were both expected to use the Hawker P.1154 supersonic V/STOL aircraft, a larger version of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier) saw the project being cancelled in the 1966 Defence White Paper. This eliminated the requirement for the Type 82 class destroyer. However, one vessel of the original four was ordered on 4 October 1966 for use as a testbed for new technologies. HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; was launched in 1969, with four new weapons and electronics systems.

== Construction ==
&quot;Bristol&quot; hull was laid down by Swan Hunter &amp; Tyne Shipbuilders Ltd on 15 November 1967. She was launched on 30 June 1969, accepted into service on 15 December 1972 and then commissioned on 31 March 1973. Her estimated building cost was £24,217,000.

==Weapon systems==
&quot;Bristol&quot; saw a number of new systems introduced into the Navy, including the Sea Dart anti-aircraft and Ikara anti-submarine missile systems and was the first Royal Navy ship to carry the 4.5 inch (113 mm) Mk 8 gun. Another addition to the fleet was the new advanced Action Data Automated Weapons System Mk.2 (ADAWS-2), a computer system designed to coordinate the ship&#x27;s weapons and sensors. ADAWS-2 was a large advance on the rudimentary action information system of its predecessor the s, which was heavily reliant on manual data input.

The Sea Dart (GWS 30) system comprised a twin-arm launcher on the quarterdeck with a pair of radar Type 909 target illumination sets, an improvement over the single radar Type 901 set of the County design. The second weapon system was the Australian Ikara anti-submarine weapon. Ikara was a rocket-powered carrier that could deliver a small homing torpedo out to from the ship. The Ikara was complemented by a Mark 10 &quot;Limbo&quot; anti-submarine mortar.

The single 4.5 inch (113 mm) Mark 8 gun was not intended as an anti-aircraft weapon, and as such had an elevation of only 55°. The weapon was designed specifically for reliability over rate of fire, allowing only a single mounting to be shipped, and the comparatively low rate of fire of 25 rounds per minute was ample for the intended anti-ship and shore-bombardment roles. &quot;Bristol&quot;, although capable of landing a Westland Wasp helicopter on the quarterdeck, lacked a hangar and aviation facilities and thus had to rely on external air support.

==Active service==

The role which &quot;Bristol&quot; was built for never materialised, and she consequently spent most of her service in the 1970s trialling and building up experience using new weapons and computer systems. A major boiler fire in 1974 destroyed the steam plant however &quot;Bristol&quot; was able to operate for a further three years using only her gas plant, demonstrating its flexibility and utility. The steam plant was repaired in 1976. In 1979 she was fitted out for frontline service with ECM, Corvus countermeasures launchers and a pair of World War II-era Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. During this refit the Limbo weapon was removed; its well was later used as a makeshift swimming pool.

===Falklands War (1982)===

&quot;Bristol&quot; was suitable for use as a flagship as she was large enough to embark the extra staff members necessary for this role. She served as the Royal Navy flagship during the 1981 &quot;Ocean Safari&quot; exercise. After a short refit, during which the mortar well was plated over to allow the landing of large helicopters on the quarterdeck, she joined the Royal Navy task force in the South Atlantic in the 1982 Falklands War. &quot;Bristol&quot; led the Bristol group of reinforcement ships south and then joined the carrier battle group, Task Group 317.8. On 22 May she fired two Sea Dart missiles at spurious radar returns caused by interference with similar radars fitted on ships within the group. After the destroyer was hit and subsequently sunk on 25 May, &quot;Bristol&quot; with and carried out duties in the air warfare role. When the aircraft carrier , the flagship, returned to the UK, &quot;Bristol&quot; took over as flagship until 17 September with Vice Admiral Derek Reffell aboard as senior-officer-in-theatre, returning to the UK after being relieved by the carrier .

On return to the UK she entered a refit and, in light of the lessons of the conflict, had her light anti aircraft weapons augmented with a pair of twin Oerlikon/BMARC 30 mm GCM-A03 and a pair of single Oerlikon/BMARC 20 mm GAM-B01 guns. Loral-Hycor SRBOC countermeasures launchers were also added to augment the elderly Corvus launchers.

===Post-Falklands service===
With the Royal Navy short on hulls after damage and losses incurred in the Falklands, &quot;Bristol&quot; remained in commission and made several overseas deployments until paid off for refit in 1984. Another boiler explosion when entering refit caused extensive damage that had to be repaired. The major work undertaken in the refit was to replace the obsolete radar Type 965 with the new Type 1022 for long-range air search duties. The Ikara system was removed; it was intended to replace it with two triple STWS-1 launchers for 324 mm anti-submarine torpedoes, but they were never fitted.

==Training ship==
By the late 1980s the ship was becoming increasingly outdated. As the fleet downsized, maintaining a unique vessel when plenty of other air defence destroyers were in commission no longer seemed worthwhile. HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; was paid off in 1991 and refitted to replace HMS &quot;Kent&quot;, as the harbour training ship located at the shore establishment . &quot;Bristol&quot; was berthed at Whale Island, Portsmouth and was primarily used as a training ship and accommodation ship for Royal Naval personnel and youth organisations. Many young people from the Sea Cadets, the Combined Cadet Force and the Sea Scouts had their first experience of life on board a warship on &quot;Bristol&quot;. Air Training Corps and Army Cadet Force units also made use of the facilities. The ship had also been used by a number of colleges running the Edexcel BTEC Public Services course. The ship&#x27;s company was made up of a mix of Royal Navy and civilian staff. She was also used by the RNVCC cadets during their first wave exercise when the recruits ended their training to become Cadets.

&quot;Bristol&quot; was refitted at A&amp;P Tyne, Hebburn. The effects of the refit were said to &quot;... extend the service life of HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; for 10 years&quot;. Work was intended to bring facilities on &quot;Bristol&quot; in line with health and safety standards. The redundant masts containing the ship&#x27;s Type 1022 and Type 992Q search radars were removed. She departed from Portsmouth on 20 October 2010, and arrived at Hebburn under tow on the morning of 3 November 2010. HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; left Hebburn in April 2011 to return to Portsmouth.

Bristol&#x27;s role as a training ship ceased on 28 October 2020, with the Ministry of Defence announcing that she would be disposed of. When news of the disposal was made public the leader of Portsmouth City Council Gerald Vernon-Jackson called for &quot;Bristol&quot; to be maintained as a museum ship within the National Museum of the Royal Navy.
HMS Bristol was transferred to the Disposal reserve ships organisation on 1 December 2020, and removed from her Portsmouth mooring in June 2024.

<text>A cabbit is a fictional hybrid between a cat and a rabbit. They have appeared in fiction and fantasy stories and have also been dubiously claimed to have been observed in the wild. Most if not all observations are attributable to either misidentified Manx cats or outright hoaxes.

A cat–rabbit hybrid creature was first incorrectly documented in 1845 by Joseph Train of Castle Douglas, Galloway, Scotland, in his &quot;An Historical and Statistical Account of the Isle of Man&quot;, where he opined that the local Manx cat, a breed typified by a short, tufty tail like a rabbit, was such a hybrid: &quot;My observations on the structure and habits of the specimen in my possession, leave little doubt on my mind of its being a ... cross between the female cat and the buck rabbit.&quot; Scientific study has determined that such a hybrid is genetically impossible.

The portmanteau term &quot;cabbit&quot; is used for such imagined hybrids. The exact year of coinage is uncertain. The term was used in 1977 to describe a specimen found in New Mexico and exhibited in Los Angeles. The specimen was showcased on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and was later determined to be a cat with a deformed pelvis.

==Cat mutations==
Manx cats and other cats with tailless or bobtailed mutations account for many alleged cabbit sightings. The mutation that causes taillessness can also cause skeletal and/or nerve abnormalities that result in the cat&#x27;s using a hopping motion. This was once accepted by breeders as a feature of the Manx&#x27;s look, but is now considered a serious fault in the show-ring and does not form part of the modern Manx standard of points. Modern breeders of the Manx are careful to breed only from cats that have normal locomotion. The relatively long hind legs of the Manx, combined with taillessness or a very short tail, give the impression of a rabbit.

In 1947, Grace Cox-Ife wrote: &quot;There are several points about a Manx that make it anything but ordinary. The chief one is, of course, its taillessness; but this is not quite the whole story. Not only must a Manx have no tail but it should really be a further joint or more short on the spinal column; that is to say there should be a hollow where the tail would normally begin. Then there is the gait – a rabbity hop rather than a walk- which is caused by the height of the hindquarters: according to the Manx Cat Club these &quot;cannot be too high, and the back cannot be too short, while there must be great depth of flank. The head should be round and large, but not of the snubby or Persian type.

Rose Tenent wrote: &quot;No cat is more fascinating than the tailless Manx, with its rabbit-like hoppity gait ... The hind legs are considerably longer than the front ones, thus giving the cat its peculiar hopping gait; incidentally, also the reason for the reasonable theory held in some quarters that the Manx cat is the result of a cross-mating between a cat and a rabbit.&quot;

<doc id="536794" wikidata="Q4918655" url="?curid=536794" title="Bit-flipping attack">
<text>A bit-flipping attack is an attack on a cryptographic cipher in which the attacker can change the ciphertext in such a way as to result in a predictable change of the plaintext, although the attacker is not able to learn the plaintext itself. Note that this type of attack is not—directly—against the cipher itself (as cryptanalysis of it would be), but against a particular message or series of messages. In the extreme, this could become a Denial of service attack against all messages on a particular channel using that cipher.

The attack is especially dangerous when the attacker knows the format of the message. In such a situation, the attacker can turn it into a similar message but one in which some important information is altered. For example, a change in the destination address might alter the message route in a way that will force re-encryption with a weaker cipher, thus possibly making it easier for an attacker to decipher the message.

When applied to digital signatures, the attacker might be able to change a promissory note stating &quot;I owe you $10.00&quot; into one stating &quot;I owe you $10,000&quot;.

Stream ciphers, such as RC4, are vulnerable to a bit-flipping attack, as are some block cipher modes of operation. &quot;See&quot; stream cipher attack. A keyed message authentication code, digital signature, or other authentication mechanism allows the recipient to detect if any bits were flipped in transit.

<doc id="536795" wikidata="Q6007649" url="?curid=536795" title="Impressive (horse)">
<text>Impressive (April 15, 1969 – March 20, 1995) was an Appendix Quarter Horse, who earned his full AQHA registration in 1971. He was the 1974 World Champion Open Aged halter stallion, the first such World Champion in his breed, despite carrying only 48 halter points in total. He sired 2,251 foals, of which thirty went on to be World Champions themselves. The horse was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2022.

== Showing and breeding ==

In his showing days, Impressive changed hands a number of times. One of his owners was Dean Landers, who also owned the halter stallions Two Eyed Jack, Coy&#x27;s Bonanza, and Sonny Dee Bar. Although Impressive was sent to race training, he never raced. He was sent home and the next year he was excluded from any performance discipline due to pedal osteitis, leaving halter as his only choice. His groundbreaking 1974 World Championship soon cemented his role in that discipline. Each time Impressive was resold, his price rose quickly; at one point, an offer of $300,000 for him was refused by Brown, who said &quot;ain&#x27;t nobody in this world got enough money to buy this horse.&quot;

Impressive was highly sought after for breeding, despite at one time carrying a stud fee of $25,000. He sired a total of 2,251 foals, and as of 2003, was estimated to have in excess of 55,000 living descendants. He was bred for his muscular and refined form, which was passed on to his offspring often enough to make him at least the #5 all-time leading Quarter Horse sire when ranked by AQHA points earned by all progeny combined.

== Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis ==

HYPP was first recognized in the 1980s, but it became evident that many horses descended from Impressive were afflicted with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and in 1992 Impressive was publicly linked to HYPP and considered the index case. As of 2009 there were 355,000 registered descendants of Impressive with approximately 4% affected with HYPP. 

HYPP is a dominant gene, and as such, all animals with even one copy of the gene, identified as &quot;N/H&quot;, will exhibit some symptoms of the disease. Horses with two copies, identified as &quot;H/H.&quot; will always pass on the condition, and research suggests that H/H horses may have more severe symptoms than N/H horses.

After a number of years of debate, effective since January 1, 2007, the AQHA amended rule 205(c)(3) and rule Rule 227(e) to require all descendants of Impressive to be tested prior to being registered, and ban from registration all horses born after January 1, 2007 with HYPP genetics confirmed by DNA testing to be homozygous for the condition (H/H). Other breed registries that accept animals with Quarter Horse bloodlines, including the American Paint Horse Association and the Appaloosa Horse Club, have instituted testing requirements but have yet to bar animals with the condition. There is currently a widespread effort among many breeders to eliminate the disease by selective breeding, but there are those who continue to breed without regard for it, or even deliberately seeking the muscular enhancement correlated with it, and in doing so perpetuate the disease&#x27;s existence.

<doc id="536799" wikidata="Q3822975" url="?curid=536799" title="Yusufzai">
<text>The Yusufzai or Yousafzai (, ), also referred to as the Esapzai (, ), or Yusufzai Afghans historically, are one of the largest tribes of Pashtuns. They are natively based in the northern part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Malakand, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Swabi, Mardan, Bajaur, Peshawar, Tor Ghar), to which they migrated from Kabul during the 16th century, but they are also present in parts of Afghanistan, including Kunar, Kabul, Kandahar and Farah. Outside of these countries, they can be found in Ghoriwala District Bannu (Mughal Khel), Balochistan Sibi (Akazai), Chagai (Hassanzai) and Rohilkandh.

Most of the Yusufzai speak a northern variety of Pashto and some southern variety of Pashto (as in case of Mughal Khel) and Afghan dialect Persian.

==Etymology==
In Pashto phonology, as /f/ is found only in loanwords and tends to be replaced by /p/, the name is usually pronounced as &quot;Yūsəpzay&quot; or &quot;Īsəpzay&quot;. The name literally means &quot;descendant of Yusuf&quot; in Pashto; &quot;Yūsuf&quot; () is an Arabic and Aramaic masculine given name meaning &quot;(God) shall add.&quot;

According to some scholars, including philologist J.W. McCrindle, the name &quot;Yūsəpzay&quot; or &quot;Īsəpzay&quot; is derived from the tribal names of &quot;Aspasioi&quot; and &quot;Assakenoi&quot; – the ancient inhabitants of the Kunar Valley and the Swat Valley who offered resistance when Alexander invaded their land in 327–326 BCE. According to historian R.C. Majumdar, the &quot;Assakenoi&quot; were either allied to or a branch of the larger &quot;Aspasioi&quot;, and both of these ancient tribal names were probably derived from the word &quot;Aśvaka&quot;, which literally means &quot;horsemen&quot;, &quot;horse breeders&quot;, or &quot;cavalrymen&quot; (from &quot;aśva&quot; or &quot;aspa&quot;, the Sanskrit and Avestan words for &quot;horse&quot;).

McCrindle noted: &quot;The name of the &quot;Aśvaka&quot; indicates that their country was renowned in primitive times, as it is at the present day, for its superior breed of horses. The fact that the Greeks translated their name into &quot;Hippasioi&quot; (from &quot;ἵππος&quot;, a horse) shows that they must have been aware of its etymological signification.&quot;

The name of the &quot;Aśvakan&quot; or &quot;Assakan&quot; is also the origin of the ethnonym &quot;Afghān&quot;, which has been historically used for all Pashtuns.

==Mythical genealogy==
According to a popular mythical genealogy, recorded by 17th-century Mughal courtier Nimat Allah al-Harawi in his book &quot;Tārīkh-i Khān Jahānī wa Makhzan-i Afghānī&quot;, the Yusufzai tribe descended from their eponymous ancestor Yūsuf, who was son of Mand, who was son of Khashay (or Khakhay), who was son of Kand, who was son of Kharshbūn, who was son of Saṛban (progenitor of the Sarbani tribal confederacy), who was son of Qais Abdur Rashid (progenitor of all Pashtuns). Qais Abdur Rashid was a descendant of Afghana, who was described as a grandson of the Israelite king Saul and commander-in-chief of the army of prophet Solomon. Qais was claimed to be a contemporary of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and a kinsman of Arab commander Khalid ibn al-Walid. When Khalid ibn al-Walid summoned Qais from Ghor to Medina, Qais accepted Islam and the prophet renamed him &quot;Abdur Rashīd&quot; (meaning &quot;Servant of the Guide to the Right Path&quot; or &quot;Servant of God&quot; in Arabic). Abdur Rashid returned to Ghor and introduced Islam there. The book stated that Yūsuf&#x27;s grandfather (and Mand&#x27;s father), Khashay, also had two other sons, Muk and Tarkalāṇī, who were the progenitors of the Gigyani and Tarkani tribes, respectively. Yūsuf had one brother, Umar, who was the progenitor of the Mandanr tribe, which is closely related to Yusufzais.

The 1595 Mughal account &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; also mentioned the tradition of Israelite descent among Pashtuns, which shows that the tradition was already popular among 16th-century Pashtuns.

==History==
===Peace treaty with Babur===

During the early modern period, the Yusufzai tribe of Afghans was first explicitly mentioned in &quot;Baburnama&quot; by Babur, a Timurid ruler from Fergana (in present-day Uzbekistan) who captured Kabul in 1504. On 21 January 1519, two weeks after his Bajaur massacre, Babur wrote: &quot;On Friday we marched for Sawad (Swat), with the intention of attacking the Yusufzai Afghans, and dismounted in between the water of Panjkora and the united waters of Chandāwal (Jandul) and Bajaur. Shah Mansur Yusufzai had brought a few well-flavoured and quite intoxicating confections.&quot;

Due to the military and strategic strength of the Yousafzai, Babur needed security from their location in the hills that threatened his empire and did not allow for a safe expansion to India. As part of a treaty with Yusufzai Afghans to have family ties, Babur married Bibi Mubarika, daughter of Yusufzai chief Shah Mansur on 30 January 1519 for mutual security after failing to subdue the tribe. Shah Mansur had favoured peace while the faction of Malik Ahmad Khan was against any forging of close ties. Bibi Mubarika played an important role in the establishment of friendly relations of Yusufzai Pashtun chiefs with Babur, who later founded the Mughal Empire after defeating Pashtun Sultan Ibrahim Lodi at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526. One of Mubarika&#x27;s brothers, Mir Jamal Yusufzai, accompanied Babur to India in 1525 and later held high posts under Mughal Emperors Humayun and Akbar. Although suspicions existed on both sides and the Yusufzai had never paid taxes or tributes to Babur or any other Mughal Emperor.

===Yusufzai Chieftaincy===
Malak Ahmad Khan Yusufzai conquered the land of Malakand division and Yusufzai remained the powerful and prominent tribe of Malakand Agency. Major parts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained under the Yusufzai Chieftaincy and major Yusufzai chiefs are the following.
* Malak Ahmad Khan Yusufzai (Reign; 1520 - 1535).
* Malak Gaju Khan Yusufzai (Reign; 1535 - 1553)
* Malak Misri Khan Ali Asghar Yusufzai (Reign; 1553 - 1580)
* Malak Ghazi Khan Yusufzai (Reign; 1580 - 1585)
* Malak Kalu Khan Yousafzai (Reign; 1585 - 1626).
* Malak Bhaku Khan Yusufzai (Reign; 1626 - 1675).

After 1675, the Yusufzai Chieftaincy was divided into 32 areas which was remained under each Yusufzai tribal Mashar (Leader).

In 1586, Akbar the Great tried to invade Malakand in the Battle of the Malandari Pass (1586) but failed and it become the greatest disaster to Mughal empire in the era of Akbar.

===Skirmishes with Mughal forces===
During the 1580s, many Yusufzais and Mandanrs rebelled against the Mughals and joined the Roshani movement of Pir Roshan. In late 1585, Moghul emperor Akbar sent military forces under Zain Khan Koka and Birbal to crush the rebellion. In February 1586, about 8,000 Mughal soldiers, including Birbal, were killed near the Karakar Pass between Swat and Buner by the Yusufzai lashkar led by Kalu Khan. This was the greatest disaster faced by the Mughal Army during Akbar&#x27;s reign.

In 1630, under the leadership of Pir Roshan&#x27;s great-grandson, Abdul Qadir, thousands of Pashtuns from the Yusufzai, Mandanrs, Kheshgi, Mohmand, Afridi, Bangash, and other tribes launched an attack on the Mughal Army in Peshawar. In 1667, the Yusufzai again revolted against the Mughals, with one of their chiefs in Swat proclaiming himself the king. Muhammad Amin Khan brought a 9,000 strong Mughal Army from Delhi to suppress the revolt. Although the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb was able to conquer the southern Yusufzai plains within the northern Kabul valley, he failed to wrest Swat and the adjoining valleys from the control of the Yusufzai.

===Durrani period===
Ahmad Shah Durrani (1747–1772), the founder of the Afghan Durrani Empire, categorized all Afghan tribes into four &quot;ulūs&quot; (tribal confederacies) for administrative purposes: Durrani, Ghilji, Sur, and Bar Durrani (&quot;Upper Durranis&quot;). The Yusufzai were included in the Bar Durrani confederacy along with other eastern Pashtun tribes, including the Mohmand, Afridi, Bangash, and Khattak. The Bar Durrani comprised the bulk of those Pashtuns who settled in Rohilkhand, India where they were known as the Rohilla.

Najib-ud-Daula, who belonged to the Yusufzai tribe, was a prominent Afghan Rohilla chief. In the 1740s, he founded the city of Najibabad in Rohilkhand. In 1757, he supported Ahmad Shah Durrani in his attack on Delhi. After his victory, Ahmad Shah Durrani re-installed the Mughal emperor Alamgir II on the Delhi throne as the titular Mughal head, but gave the actual control of Delhi to Najib ad-Daula. From 1757 to 1770, Najib ad-Daula served as the governor of Saharanpur, also ruling over Dehradun. In 1761, he took part in the Third Battle of Panipat and provided thousands of Rohilla troops and many guns to Ahmad Shah Durrani to defeat the Marathas. He also convinced Shuja-ud-Daula, the Nawab of Awadh, to join the Durrani forces. Before his departure from Delhi, Ahmad Shah Durrani appointed Najib-ud-Daula as &quot;Mir Bakshi&quot; (paymaster-general) of the Mughal emperor Shah Alam II. After his death in 1770, Najib ad-Dawlah was succeeded by his son, Zabita Khan, who was defeated in 1772 by a joint Mughal-Maratha force, forcing him to flee from Rohilkhand. However, the descendants of Najib ad-Dawlah continued to rule Najibabad area until they were defeated by the British at Nagina on 21 April 1858 during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

Today, many Yusufzais are settled in India, most notably in Rohilkhand region, as well as in Farrukhabad, which was founded in 1714 by Pashtun Nawab Muhammad Khan Bangash.

===State of Dir===

In Dir, descendants of 17th-century Akhund Ilyas Yusufzai, the founder of the city of Dir, laid the foundation of the state of Dir. In 1897, the British Raj annexed Dir and granted the title of the &quot;Nawab of Dir&quot; to Sharif Khan Akhundkhel, the ruler of Dir (1886–1904).

The princely state of Dir existed until 1969, after which they were merged into West Pakistan, and then in 1970 into the North-West Frontier Province (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) of Pakistan. Its area is part of the present-day Buner, Lower Dir and Upper Dir. 

===Yousafzai of Ghoriwala===
One of Iliaszai grandson through Taje, was a man named Gadezai, who had five sons: Hassan, Behram, Ali Sher, Hussain, and Ibrahim. The first four sons settled in present-day District Buner, while Ibrahim was separated from them during the massacre of Yousafzai by Ulugh Beg in Kabul. Initially settling in Kurram, Ibrahim&#x27;s descendants eventually migrated to Ghoriwala in present-day District Bannu.

Ibrahim had only one son named Hassan Khan, and his family was known as Hassan Khel. However, after one of his descendant, Mughal Khan Yousafzai, his tribe came to be known as Mughal Khel. Mughal Khan&#x27;s leadership and capabilities helped establish his tribe as one of the leading and honorable tribes of Bannu. Jaffar Khan Yousafzai, Mughal Khan&#x27;s grandson, also earned a name and place for himself among the elders of the district. He also commissioned the construction of a beautiful mosque in Bannu Bazar in around 1820s.
The Mughal Khel tribe has the following sub-tribes: Qasim Khel, Jaffar Khel, Hakim Khel, and Muhammad Hassan Khel. The Mughal Khel have ruled and held the position of maliks in Ghoriwala for more than 300 years. Due to centuries of living in a land far away from their brethren, the Mughal Khels gradually assimilated in the local society, adopting the local elements and thus have transitioned from the Hard Pashto pronunciations to Soft Pashto but still in their speech and appearance their long lost characters can be identified.

As the author of Bannu Gazetteer said:


==Pashto dialect==
Yusufzai Pashto, which is a variety of Northern Pashto, is the prestige variety of Pashto in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. Some of its consonants differ from the other dialects:

==Society==
The Yusufzai Pashtun aristocracy was historically divided into several communities based on patrilineal segmentary groups:
;&quot;Khān&quot;
The &quot;khān&quot; referred to the Yusufzai landowners. In the 16th century, saint Sheikh Milli, a prominent Yusufzai dignitary, distributed the Yusufzai land among the major Yusufzai tribal clans (&quot;khēl&quot;). However, to avoid inequalities, he ordered that the lands should not become permanent property of the clans, but rather they should be realloted within the patrilineal clans periodically after every ten years or so. In this system (&quot;wēsh&quot;), each landowning &quot;khān&quot; would own shares (&quot;brakha&quot;) representing his proportion of the total area distributed. Through a regular rotation of ownership, the Yusufzai landowners would migrate for up to 30 miles for their new share after each cycle, although the tenants cultivating the land would stay on.

The &quot;wēsh&quot; system operated among the Yusufzai of Swat region until at least 1920s.
;&quot;Hamsāya&quot;
The &quot;hamsāya&quot; or &quot;shade sharers&quot; were the clients or dependents from other (non-Yusufzai) Pashtun tribes who became attached to the Yusufzai tribe over the years. 
;&quot;Faqīr&quot;
The &quot;faqīr&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; were the non-Pashtun landless peasants who were assigned to the Yusufzai landowners. As dependent peasants, the &quot;faqīr&quot; used to pay rent for the land they cultivated.

In the 19th century, the distinction between &quot;hamsāya&quot; as a &quot;dependent Pashtun tribe&quot; and &quot;faqīr&quot; as &quot;non-Pashtun landless peasants&quot; became blurred. Both terms were then interchangeably used to simply refer to landless dependents or clients.
;&quot;Mlātəṛ&quot;
The &quot;mlātəṛ&quot; or &quot;supporters&quot; provided services to their patrons as artisans (&quot;kasabgar&quot;), musicians (&quot;ḍəm&quot;), herders, or commercial agents, mostly in return for a payment in grain or rice.
;&quot;Ghulām&quot;
The &quot;ghulām&quot; or &quot;slaves&quot; were more closely attached to their patron and his family and frequently entrusted with a variety of functions within their master&#x27;s household. Although the &quot;ghulām&quot; were less free as compared to the &quot;hamsāya&quot; or the &quot;faqīr&quot;, they generally enjoyed a higher status in the society.

<text>My Dying Bride are an English doom metal band formed in Bradford. Since their inception in 1990, they have released 15 studio albums, five EPs, one demo, one box set, four compilation albums, one live album, and one live CD/DVD release.

Along with Anathema and Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride were a forerunner of the death doom metal and gothic metal genres during the early 1990s. These bands comprise &quot;The Peaceville Three&quot; as all were signed to Peaceville Records at the time.

==History==
===Early years (1990–1992)===
My Dying Bride was formed in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, in June 1990, by guitarist Andrew Craighan, drummer Rick Miah, vocalist Aaron Stainthorpe, and guitarist Calvin Robertshaw. Craighan and Miah were previously members of the band Abiosis. After six months of rehearsing, the band recorded and released their demo, &quot;Towards the Sinister&quot;, which was produced by Tim Walker of Voltage Records. Its title was taken from a line in the song &quot;Symphonaire Infernus et Spera Empyrium&quot;. The band then released their first single, &quot;God Is Alone&quot;, on a small French label called Listenable. After the single had sold out almost immediately, they were picked up by Peaceville Records, and they could release their first EP, &quot;Symphonaire Infernus et Spera Empyrium&quot;, which also featured their latest recruit, bassist Adrian Jackson. The EP was soon followed by their first album, &quot;As the Flower Withers&quot;.

===&quot;Turn Loose the Swans&quot; (1992–1994)===
&quot;As the Flower Withers&quot; was followed by a large tour in the UK and the mainland Europe, and in 1992 they recorded their next EP, &quot;The Thrash of Naked Limbs&quot;. Another tour was planned, but cancelled when their current drummer had a bad fall while shooting the accompanying video. In 1993, Martin Powell joined as My Dying Bride&#x27;s keyboardist and violinist, and they started the recording of their second studio album, &quot;Turn Loose the Swans&quot;. With the joining of Martin Powell, the usage of violin increased even more since their &quot;As the Flower Withers&quot; album. The album was released that year followed by a tour and another EP, &quot;I Am the Bloody Earth&quot;.

===&quot;The Angel and the Dark River&quot; (1995)===
1995 saw the release of My Dying Bride&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Angel and the Dark River&quot;. The album was followed with a successful tour with some of their first festival gigs, and soon after the fans saw the release of their first compilation album, &quot;Trinity&quot;, a collection of songs from their first three EPs. In the end of 1995, My Dying Bride traveled on a three-month tour with Iron Maiden.

===&quot;Like Gods of the Sun&quot; (1996–1997)===
&quot;Like Gods of the Sun&quot; continued in the direction of &quot;The Angel and the Dark River&quot;, in that it did not contain any growling vocals by Aaron Stainthorpe. This was the fourth album of My Dying Bride, featuring songs like &quot;A Kiss to Remember&quot;, &quot;For You&quot; and &quot;For My Fallen Angel&quot;. &quot;For My Fallen Angel&quot; is strictly an orchestral composition with sections of violin and synth. It is also the last MDB album to feature a violin, until &quot;For Lies I Sire&quot;.

===&quot;34.788%...Complete&quot; and hiatus (1998–2001)===
The somewhat experimental &quot;34.788%...Complete&quot; was next, followed by &quot;The Light at the End of the World&quot;. My Dying Bride entered a hiatus after this, releasing two retrospective albums &quot;Meisterwerk 1&quot; and &quot;Meisterwerk 2&quot;. The &quot;Meisterwerk&quot; albums are compilations that contain previously released and rare material from My Dying Bride. At the end of the hiatus, Calvin Robertshaw left the band to become their tour manager and was replaced by Hamish Glencross.

===&quot;The Dreadful Hours&quot; (2001–2004)===
Originally released in 2001, &quot;The Dreadful Hours&quot; featured new material with the seventh release. The album was again engineered by Mags and co-produced by guitarist Andrew Craighan. Between 2003 and 2004, the band&#x27;s label, Peaceville, re-released their entire back-catalogue in digipak format, with bonus tracks consisting of demos, remixes, and live performances added to each release (except &quot;The Light at the End of the World&quot;).

===&quot;Songs of Darkness, Words of Light&quot; (2004–2005)===
2004&#x27;s follow-up was &quot;Songs of Darkness, Words of Light&quot;.

The band&#x27;s next release came in May 2005, when they released the fancifully titled &quot;Anti-Diluvian Chronicles&quot;, a fully-fledged &quot;best of&quot; box set featuring three discs and thirty tracks.

===&quot;A Line of Deathless Kings&quot; (2006–2007)===
The band spent the winter of 2005/2006 writing material for new studio album &quot;A Line of Deathless Kings&quot;. The album was released on 9 October 2006. It was preceded by the EP &quot;Deeper Down&quot; on 18 September. Shortly before the release of &quot;A Line of Deathless Kings&quot;, Shaun Taylor-Steels announced his permanent departure from the band due to persistent problems with his ankle.

In early 2007, Jackson announced his departure and session-drummer John Bennett from The Prophecy could no longer stay, citing a lack of time due to work commitments. Replacements were found in Lena Abé on bass and Dan Mullins on drums.

===&quot;For Lies I Sire&quot;, &quot;Evinta&quot;, &quot;The Barghest O&#x27; Whitby&quot; (2009–2011)===

In November 2008, My Dying Bride began work on their tenth studio album, entitled &quot;For Lies I Sire&quot;, which was released on 23 March 2009. Due to Sarah Stanton&#x27;s pregnancy, she had been replaced on keyboards by Katie Stone, she performed violin on &quot;For Lies I Sire&quot;. Soon after the album&#x27;s release, she was replaced by Shaun MacGowan.

On 26 October 2009, My Dying Bride released an EP/DVD titled &quot;Bring Me Victory&quot;. Except for the title track and its video, it also includes a doom metal cover of the traditional song &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;, a cover of &quot;Failure&quot; by Swans and a live version of &quot;Vast Choirs&quot; (originally from As the Flower Withers), performed at Graspop 2008.

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of My Dying Bride&#x27;s existence, the album &quot;Evinta&quot; was released on 30 May 2011. &quot;Evinta&quot; featured some previous My Dying Bride material re-worked as neo-classical and ambient songs. Soon after, the band announced the release of the EP &quot;The Barghest o&#x27; Whitby&quot;, which was released 7 November 2011, and consists of a single, 27-minute track.

===&quot;A Map of All Our Failures&quot; and &quot;The Manuscript&quot; (2012–2014)===
&quot;A Map of All Our Failures&quot; was released on 15 October 2012.

On 13 May 2013, the band released a four-track EP, &quot;The Manuscript&quot;. Three of the four tracks from the EP were recorded at the same time as &quot;A Map of All Our Failures&quot;. A year later on 26 May 2014 the songs of this EP were re-released together with &quot;The Barghest O&#x27; Whitby&quot; as &quot;The Vaulted Shadows&quot; compilation.

Guitarist Hamish Glencross had been fired upon returning from their U.S. 2014 Maryland Deathfest appearance, and original guitarist Calvin Robertshaw returned to the band.

===&quot;Feel the Misery&quot; and move to Nuclear Blast (2015–2019)===

On 18 September 2015, &quot;Feel the Misery&quot; was released, with eight tracks. In March 2017, the band signed with Nuclear Blast Records. The same year, drummer Dan Mullins left the band, and was replaced with Shaun Steels, who had been in the band from 1999 to 2006, and had played on &quot;A Map of All Our Failures&quot; in 2012 as a session member.

In 2017, after cancelling four festival appearances, Aaron Stainthorpe explained that the band was working on a new album, and had therefore not disbanded. In fact, My Dying Bride signed a new contract with Nuclear Blast. In a My Dying Bride Facebook post on 18 September 2018, Aaron Stainthorpe explained that the band cancelled those shows due to the cancer of his 5-year-old daughter, who is presently in remission.

On 4 December 2018, the band announced that Shaun Steels had been replaced by Jeff Singer due to &quot;unresolvable drumming issues&quot; and that the drum tracks for the new album had been completed by Singer.

On 24 May 2019, the band released &quot;A Harvest of Dread&quot;, a deluxe 12-inch 92-page hardback book five-disc set of rarities, early works, previously unheard pre-production demos, band favorites, and live audio. Also in 2019, Calvin Robertshaw had left My Dying Bride for a second time, and was replaced by Neil Blanchett on guitars.

===&quot;The Ghost of Orion&quot; (2020–2023)===
My Dying Bride&#x27;s 13th album, &quot;The Ghost of Orion&quot;, was released on 6 March 2020. It was released five years after their previous effort, &quot;Feel the Misery&quot;, which is the band&#x27;s longest gap between studio albums to date.

Beforehand, the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Your Broken Shore&quot;, was released on 20 January, followed by a second single, &quot;Tired of Tears&quot;, on 7 February.

Later in 2020, the band released their 7th EP, &quot;Macabre Cabaret&quot;.

===&quot;A Mortal Binding&quot; (2024–present)===
My Dying Bride announced in February their 14th studio album, &quot;A Mortal Binding&quot;, which was released on 19 April 2024. Preceding the release were singles &quot;Thornwyck Hymn&quot; in February and &quot;The 2nd of Three Bells&quot; in March.

However, just two weeks before the album launch, the band canceled all live shows, citing internal tensions among members. In an interview with Devolution magazine, vocalist Aaron Stainthorpe revealed that he and guitarist Andrew Craighan had been managing the band without a formal manager for years, which had led to creative disagreements and stress. Stainthorpe emphasised the need for a break to avoid a &quot;massive bust-up&quot;, acknowledging that while it was not an ideal time to pause given their album release and scheduled gigs the decision was necessary for the band&#x27;s well-being.

On 6 December 2024, the band announced that they will continue performing live shows in 2025, but due to Stainthorpe having been absent from the band since their short break, they will tour with Swallow the Sun vocalist Mikko Kotamäki.

<doc id="536807" wikidata="Q17366057" url="?curid=536807" title="Indenture">
<text>An indenture is a legal contract that reflects an agreement between two parties. Although the term is most familiarly used to refer to a labor contract between an employer and a laborer with an indentured servant status, historically indentures were used for a variety of contracts, including transfers and rents of land and even peace agreements between rulers.

==Historical usage==
An indenture is a legal contract between two parties, whether for indentured labour or a term of apprenticeship or for certain land transactions. The term comes from the medieval English &quot;indenture of retainer&quot;—a legal contract written in duplicate on the same sheet, with the copies separated by cutting along a jagged (toothed, hence the term &quot;indenture&quot;) line so that the teeth of the two parts could later be refitted to confirm authenticity (chirograph). Each party to the deed would then retain a part. When the agreement was made before a court of law a &quot;tripartite&quot; indenture was made, with the third piece kept at the court. The term is used for any kind of deed executed by more than one party, in contrast to a deed poll which is made by one individual. In the case of bonds, the indenture shows the pledge, promises, representations and covenants of the issuing party.

Although other evidence indicates that the method has been in use from around the year 1000, the earliest surviving examples in England are from the thirteenth century. These are agreements for military service, proving that a paid contract army was then in existence. Exchequer records of Henry V&#x27;s French campaign of 1415, which culminated in the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415, including the indentures of all the captains of the army agreeing to provide specified numbers of men and at what cost, may still be read. An indenture was commonly used as a form of sealed contract or agreement for land and buildings. An example of such a use can be found in the National Archives, where an indenture, from about 1401, recording the transfer of the manor of Pinley, Warwickshire, is held.

In the early history of the United States, many European immigrants served a period of indentured labour in order to pay the cost of their transportation. This practice was common during the 17th and 18th centuries, where over half of immigrants worked off an average of three years&#x27; servitude.

==Modern usage==
&quot;Bond indenture&quot; (also &quot;trust indenture&quot; or &quot;deed of trust&quot;) is a legal document issued to lenders and describes key terms such as the interest rate, maturity date, convertibility, pledge, promises, representations, covenants, and other terms of the bond offering. When the offering memorandum is prepared in advance of marketing a bond, the indenture will typically be summarised in the &quot;description of notes&quot; section.

In the United States, public debt offerings in excess of $10 million require the use of an indenture of trust under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The rationale for this is that it is necessary to establish a collective action mechanism under which creditors can collect in a fair, orderly manner if default takes place (like that which occurs during bankruptcy). No trust relationship exists between the bondholder and the issuing corporation. These two are in a regular contractual, arm&#x27;s length, non-fiduciary, non-equity relationship. Rather, the trustee in a &quot;trust indenture&quot; is a third party, usually a specialist company, who is appointed by the issuer to handle and safeguard the interests of the numerous public bondholders, in events ranging from the usual distribution of coupons and principal payments to dealing with the issuer&#x27;s default, if any occurs.

<text>The Shinwari () are an ethnic Pashtun tribe of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Among the greatest poets of the Pashto language in the 20th century was the late Ameer Hamza Shinwari, also known as &quot;Hamza Baba&quot;.

The Shinwari tribe are descended from the Kasi Pashtun tribe settled in the southern districts of Nangarhar Province, in Haska Meyna, Achin, Rodat, Bati Kot, Kot, Chaprahar, Shinwar, Dor Baba and Nazian districts. A major portion of the tribe is centered in Jalalabad and Parwan province of Afghanistan, and Khyber Pass, Pakistan. These Shinwaris are mostly traders and businessmen. There are more than 3,000 Shinwaris settled in the Alizai village, 15 km away from Kohat, Pakistan. Mirdad Khel, a sub-tribe of the Shinwaris, migrated to Swat Valley during the 1750s and settled there. Among them one of the notable Shinwaris is Senator Abdul Rahim Mirdad Khel. In Afghanistan, the Shinwari are also located in the Kunar Valley. Reporting from 2010 states that there are around 400,000 Shinwari in Afghanistan.

==Location==
The Shinwari tribe is settled in the southern districts of Nangarhar Province, in Haska Meyna, Achin, Rodat, Bati Kot, Kot, Chaprahar, Shinwar, Dor Baba and Nazian districts. A major portion of this tribe is also settled between Landi Kotal (Pakistan) and Jalalabad (Afghanistan), as well as in Parwan province of Afghanistan where they are concentrated in Shinwari, Ghorband, and Jabalussaraj districts. These Shinwaris are mostly traders and businessmen. There is also a significant minority of the tribe settled in Kohat and Hangu (Jangal Khel, Haji Abad, Mohallah Sangirh), Pakistan, a settlement 60 km south of Peshawar. In Afghanistan, the Shinwari are also located in Kunar, Bajaur Agency and Lower Dir. At Lower Dir, Munjai village contains a huge population of the Shinwari tribe, which had migrated from Afghanistan to Chamrakand (Mohmand Agency and Bajaur Agency) in the 1890s, and settled in the fertile land of Munjai village in Lower Dir. Reporting from 2010 states that there are around 400,000 Shinwari in Afghanistan. The Shinwaris reside in hilly areas with narrow valleys such as in the Khyber Agency where mountain ranges meet there: Lacha Gar, Karagah Ghar, Surghar, Tor Ghar Morgah, and Kalauch. The famous Khyber Pass, at 1,180 meters (3,870 ft.) ASL, is the gateway to Afghanistan through the Kuh-e Sefid range.

The Khyber Agency has two major rivers. The Bara River in the southern Khajuri Plain provides for relatively arable farm land. The Kabul River forms the northern boundary, separating Khyber from Mohmand Agency. Another river in the agency is the Chora, which flows east-northeast on the north side of the Surghar range. Valleys: Maidan, Rujgal, Bara, Bazaar, Choora, Wachpal and Tirah.

Khyber Agency experiences hot temperatures during the summer season, May through August. Maximum temperatures may reach 104 degrees, while the lower average 79 degrees. During the cooler months of November through April, however, average high temperatures reach 64 degrees and lows dip to around 39 degrees. Average annual rainfall over the Khyber Agency is 15 to 16 inches

The elders of the Shinwari tribe in Nangarhar signed a pact, uniting against the Taliban. They promised that anyone supporting the Taliban, would be punished with fines and expulsion. This pact, which per &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;appears to be the first&quot; incident of an entire tribe declaring war against the Taliban, has invited comparison with the Sunni Awakening of 2006, which tipped the balance of power in Iraq against the Sunni insurgency. The pact also had economic implications that America offered over in development funding. Further, reports suggested the Shinwari were against Taliban interference with their traditional smuggling routes across the Pakistani border.

The security situation in Haska Mena district is getting worse daily due to the increased number of Taliban insurgents operating in Naria Aubo Village, Papen Village, Dara Village, Aughuz Village and other remote villages in the district, In December 2014, Most of the Taliban insurgents have changed from Taliban to ISIL-KP carrying out insurgent activities under the direct order of Abdul Khaliq, Who is the head of Taliban in Haska Mena. Several people were killed and injured during the insurgency in Haska Mena district, The most common are:
* Killing of General Kafee in Haska Mena due to his work with Ministry of Defence of Afghanistan in Jalalabad city.
* Killing of Masjid Mullah in Kutawal village, Haska Mena at night.
* Kidnapping of Deputy District Governor of Nangarhar Province, Mr. Nazifullah, but later released due to the intervention within district elders.
* Kidnapping and persecution of USAID contract driver, Mr. Baitullah in Haska Mena district due to working with the US government agencies, he was beaten, injured and wounded by cutting his right hand three fingers so that he can be not able to drive any more for USAID missions in Haska Mena. Later on he was also released on the intervention of the elder by the promise that he will not work anymore for any USAID or other government agencies. The district government was also unable to provide protection and help to this kind of peoples.
* Some Sub tribes of Shinwaris such as Mirdad Khel migrated to the Swat Valley in 1935 and then settled there.

==History==

===British assessment (1885)===
In 1885, a British author described the Shinwari (&quot;Shanwari&quot; in his text):

:&quot;The &quot;Shanwari&quot; inhabit a portion of the Khaibar mountains, some of the eastern valleys of the Safed Koh, and are also found on the borders of Bajaur. They have five sections - Mandizai/Manduzai, Abdul Rahim, Sangu, Sipai, and Ali Sher. They have been continuously predatory since the British approached their borders. They are the most industrious carriers between Peshawur and the other marts on the way to Kabul, using mules and camels for carriage. They are brave, hospitable, stalwart and hardworking. They are well-educated people&quot;

==Feuds and alliances==

The Shinwari tribe has been known to form alliances with the Mohmands, the Safis, and the Afridis. 

However, some sources indicate that the Mohmand tribe is frequently in a state of conflict with the Shinwari tribe.
The Shinwari tribe has historically feuded with the Khogyani tribe, which is a Karlani sub-tribe. There are some historical inter-tribal feuds over land.

=== Role in the Anglo-Afghan War === 
During the First Afghan War, a raid on the Shinwarree valley was conducted in Nangarhar, on the 24th of July 1842 Shinwari tribesmen skirmished with the British invaders and another action occurred in the 26th of July where a larger British Artillery force engaged the tribesmen.

=== Role in the Khost Rebellion ===

During the Khost rebellion, the Shinwari aligned themselves with the Afghan Government and helped quell the revolt. 

===Role in 1929 Afghan Civil War===
During the late 1928 riots, the Shinwari tribe were the first to openly rebel against king Amanullah Khan&#x27;s imposition of various new laws, including the requirement to wear European dress, the rule that required them to send a quota of their daughters to Kabul for education and the impositions of taxes (they had never previously paid tax). The Shinwaris attacked Jalalabad, cutting off its water supply and closing the Kabul–Peshawar road. Amanullah responded by using his fledgling Air Force, including Soviet pilots, to bomb the Shinwaris. The use of foreign &quot;infidels&quot; to subjugate Muslims roused other tribes to revolt and the country descended into what would become the 1929 Afghan Civil War.

==Tribe==
The Shinwaris are derived from the Kasi tribe, and are further distributed into sub-tribes:
==Notable Shinwari==

* Ghalib Hassan, leader in the anti-Taliban resistance under Abdul Haq, appointed District Commander of Shinwar, Afghanistan by Hamid Karzai, held in extrajudicial detention in the United States&#x27; Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba

<text>Christian music is music that has been written to express either personal or a communal belief regarding Christian life and faith. Common themes of Christian music include praise, worship, penitence and lament, and its forms vary widely around the world. Church music, hymnals, gospel and worship music are a part of Christian media and also include contemporary Christian music which itself supports numerous Christian styles of music, including hip hop, rock, contemporary worship and urban contemporary gospel.

Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance and even the definition of Christian music varies according to culture and social context. Christian music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes or with a positive message as an entertainment product for the marketplace. 
== Worship services ==


Among the most prevalent uses of Christian music are in church worship or other gatherings. Most Christian music involves singing, whether by the whole congregation (assembly), or by a specialized subgroup—such as a soloist, duet, trio, quartet, madrigal, choir, or worship band— or both. It is frequently accompanied by instruments, but some denominations such as some Exclusive Brethren, the Churches of Christ, the Primitive Baptists and the Free Church of Scotland prefer unaccompanied or &quot;a cappella&quot; singing. Other denominations such as Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians sing alongside some form on accompaniments. Some groups, such as the Bruderhof, sing songs both with religious and non-religious meanings and words. For them, the act of singing is important. One of the earliest forms of worship music in the church was the Gregorian chant. Pope Gregory I, while not the inventor of chant, was acknowledged as the first person to order such music in the church, hinting the name &quot;Gregorian&quot; chant. The chant reform took place around 590–604 CE (reign of Pope Gregory I) (Kamien, pg. 65–67). The Gregorian chant was known for its very monophonic sound. Believing that complexity had a tendency to create cacophony, which ruined the music, Gregory I kept things very simple with the chant.

=== Instrumental accompaniment ===

In the West, the majority of Christian denominations use instruments such as an organ, piano, electronic keyboard, guitar, or other accompaniment, and occasionally by a band or orchestra, to accompany the singing. But some churches have historically not used instruments, citing their absence from the New Testament. During the last century or so several of these groups have revised this stance.

The singing of the Eastern Orthodox is also generally unaccompanied, though in the United States organs are sometimes used as a result of Western influence.

=== Instrumental music ===

Some worship music may be unsung, simply instrumental. During the Baroque period in Europe, the chorale prelude (for organ) was widely used, generally composed by using a popular hymn tune thematically, and a wide corpus of other solo organ music began to develop across Europe. Some of the most well-known exponents of such organ compositions include Johann Sebastian Bach, Dieterich Buxtehude, George Frideric Handel, François Couperin, César Franck and Charles-Marie Widor to name a few. Up to the present time, various composers have written instrumental (often organ) music as acts of worship, including well known organ repertoire by composers like Olivier Messiaen, Louis Vierne, Maurice Duruflé, and Jean Langlais.

The church sonata (for orchestra and chamber group) and other sacred instrumental musical forms also developed from the Baroque period onwards.

== Types of Christian music ==

=== Chants===
A chant is the iterative speaking or singing of words or sounds, often primarily on one or two main pitches called reciting tones. Chants may range from a simple melody involving a limited set of notes to highly complex musical structures, often including a great deal of repetition of musical subphrases, such as Great Responsories and Offertories of Gregorian chant. Chant may be considered speech, music, or a heightened or stylized form of speech. In the later Middle Ages some religious chant evolved into song (forming one of the roots of later Western music).

Mostly used in Anglican, Catholic, and Orthodox churches. Some examples of chants are:
*Ambrosian chant
*Anglican chant
*Armenian chant
*Celtic chant
*Ethiopian chant
*Galician chant
*Gregorian chant
*Kievan chant
*Mozarabic chant
*Old Roman chant
*Syriac chant

=== Metrical Psalters===
A metrical psalter is a kind of Bible translation: a book containing a metrical translation of all or part of the Book of Psalms in vernacular poetry, meant to be sung as hymns in a church. Some metrical psalters include melodies or even harmonisations. The composition of metrical psalters was a large enterprise of the Protestant Reformation, especially in its Calvinist manifestation.

Mostly used in reformed churches, and anabaptists. Some examples of psalters are:
*Genevan Psalter
*German Psalter &quot;des Königlichen Propheten David&quot; 
*Dutch Psalter
*Scottish Metrical Psalter (1650)

=== Hymns===
A Reformation approach, the normative principle of worship, produced a burst of hymn writing and congregational singing. Martin Luther is notable not only as a reformer, but as the author of hymns including &quot;Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott&quot; (&quot;A Mighty Fortress Is Our God&quot;), &quot;Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ&quot; (&quot;Praise be to You, Jesus Christ&quot;), and many others. Luther and his followers often used their hymns, or chorales, to teach tenets of the faith to worshipers. The first Protestant hymnal was published in Bohemia in 1532 by the Unitas Fratrum.
Mostly used by Protestant churches, principally Lutheran, Methodist, and Hussite traditions, but in some areas also by Roman Catholic and Anabaptists. Some examples of famous hymnals are:
*Ausbund, oldest Anabaptist hymnal
*Baptist Hymnal
*Evangelisches Kirchengesangbuch, the first hymnal in German speaking churches
*Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland
*Jistebnice hymn book, Czech hymnal from around 1430

=== Contemporary Christian music ===
From the latter half of the 20th century to the present day in Western Christendom—especially in the United States and in other countries with evangelical churches—various genres of music originally often related to pop rock, have been created under the label of Contemporary Christian Music (&quot;CCM&quot;) for home-listening and concert use. It can be divided into several genres and subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. These genres (sometimes referred to as &quot;style&quot;) like other forms of music may be distinguished by the techniques, the styles, the context and the themes, or geographical origin. Specific subgenres of CCM may include (but are not limited to): Christian country music, Christian pop, Christian rock, Christian metal, Christian hardcore, Christian punk, Christian alternative rock, Christian R&amp;B, Christian electronic dance music and Christian hip hop.

In the 1980s and 1990s, contemporary Christian music played a significant role in Evangelical Christian worship. A great variety of musical styles has developed traditional praise.

==== Other languages ====

Similar developments took place in other language, for example the German and Korean Contemporary Christian music.
==== Industry ====
Christian music is supported by a segment of the general music industry which evolved as a parallel structure to the same. Beginning in the 1970s and developing out of the Jesus movement, the Christian music industry subsequently developed into a near-billion dollar enterprise. By the 1990s the genre had eclipsed classical, jazz, and new-age music, and artists began gaining acceptance in the general market. There are several programs of schooling that have been created to create new christian artists such as Hillsong College in Norwest, Australia, and Visible Christian College in Memphis, TN U.S.A. Hillsong United is the band out of Hillsong college and they took the worship music scene by storm in 2016 with the song &quot;What a Beautiful Name&quot; which won the GMA Dove song of the year in 2017. Other famous artists include Chris Tomlin, Casting Crowns, Amy Grant, and Skillet.

==== Media ====
Today, Christian music is available through most available media. Christian music is broadcast over the radio, television, or the Internet. Christian Albums and video recordings (CD, LP, digital download, DVD, etc.) have been increasingly more popular and have continued to increase in sales.

Christian Musicals is another growing area, especially with the help of the internet. Church drama groups frequently enjoy performing musical dramas which can be downloaded on-line for free use.

There are Christian tv shows and movies. One example of a Christian tv show is the drama series called The Chosen, and children&#x27;s shows such as VeggieTales. There is a whole series of Christian movies by the Kendrick Brothers production company, who have created movies such as Fireproof, Overcomer, and Courageous.

==== Music festivals and conferences ====
In the US several Christian music festivals have been organized. They are common in the summertime and draw many different people, specifically those from organized groups such as church youth groups and campus groups. In addition to music festivals like those that are part of the Christian Festival Association, there are also many Christian conferences which focus more on speakers, but usually also have musical performances, especially for a Worship service.

The Ichthus Music Festival started in 1970. Today festivals are held annually around the world, and may draw upwards of 100,000 people.

New Zealand&#x27;s Parachute Music Festival, the largest Christian music festival in the Southern Hemisphere, began in 1989 and is held annually at Mystery Creek Events Centre outside the city of Hamilton.

England&#x27;s Big Church Day Out Festival began in 2009 and has annual attendance of approximately 20,000.

==== Concerts ====

Like any musical group or act, many Christian musical artists perform concerts in concert halls, bars &amp; clubs, or outdoor venues, as well as in church-related venues. Sometimes it may be for pure entertainment, other times with the intention of witnessing (evangelizing by bearing witness of one&#x27;s faith), and other times may be part worship as well.

<doc id="536813" wikidata="Q7070198" url="?curid=536813" title="Nurse Ratched">
<text>Nurse Ratched (full name Mildred Ratched in the movie, also known as &quot;Big Nurse&quot;) is a fictional character and the main antagonist of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;, first featured in Ken Kesey&#x27;s 1962 novel as well as the 1975 film adaptation. A coldhearted and passive-aggressive tyrant, Nurse Ratched has become the stereotype of the nurse as a battleaxe. She has also become a popular metaphor for the corrupting influence of institutional power and authority in bureaucracies such as the psychiatric treatment center in which the novel is set.

Nurse Ratched is the head administrative nurse at the Salem State Hospital, a mental institution where she exercises near-absolute power over the patients&#x27; access to medications, privileges, and basic necessities such as food and toiletries. She capriciously revokes these privileges whenever a patient displeases her. Her superiors turn a blind eye because she maintains order, keeping the patients from acting out, either through antipsychotic and anticonvulsant drugs or her own brand of psychotherapy, which consists mostly of humiliating patients into doing her bidding. Her tyrannical rule and her cruel personality stems from her time as an army nurse during World War II.

==Creation==

===Origin===
Author Kesey stated that he based Ratched on the head nurse of the psychiatric ward where he worked. He later ran into her at an aquarium, realizing &quot;She was much smaller than I remembered, and a whole lot more human.&quot; The 1940s pageboy hairstyle was, according to Louise Fletcher, &quot;a symbol that life had stopped for her (Ratched) a long time ago&quot;.

===Appearance===
In Ken Kesey&#x27;s novel, Ratched &quot;the Big Nurse&quot; is described by Chief Bromden according to him: &quot;She had a face that is smooth, calculated, and precision-made, like an expensive baby doll, skin like flesh-colored enamel which is a blend of white and cream, with baby-blue eyes, and a small nose with pink little nostrils. The only features that does not match Ratched&#x27;s appearance are her lips and fingernails that are both an &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;funny&quot; red-orange, like the tip of a soldering iron, a color that looks so hot or so cold that if she touches someone with it, no one could tell which.&quot;

Her breasts are described as either &quot;massive&quot; or &quot;over-sized&quot;. She wears a white, heavily starched, nurse&#x27;s uniform that she uses to conceal her top-heavy bosom as she is ashamed and embittered of them. She wears her hair in a tight bun and high heels where she walks stiffly everywhere she goes, and sometimes carries a woven wicker bag that contains pills, needles, wire, and forceps.

To everyone else, she is a dull-looking middle-aged woman and is mainly an intimidating nurse who comes off as a twisted maternal figure to her patients. Milos Forman&#x27;s depiction of the character, who is played by Louise Fletcher, however, is based on the stage-play performances of the character in Broadway, New York.

==Character biography==
When Randle McMurphy arrives at the hospital, he flouts her rules with impunity and inspires other patients to follow. Her attempts to cow him into submission—at first with threats and mild punishments, then with shock therapy—are unsuccessful, serving only to fuel his defiance.

McMurphy helps organize an unauthorized party late one evening, and they invite two prostitute friends, Sandra and Candy, into the asylum. After noticing fellow patient Billy Bibbitt has a crush on Candy, McMurphy encourages her to have sex with him. Ratched catches Billy and Candy in the act. Furious, she threatens to tell his mother. He begs her not to, blaming McMurphy and the other patients for orchestrating the event.

Ratched sends him to wait in the ward doctor&#x27;s office as the authorities are called. When Dr. Spivey finally arrives, he finds Billy has killed himself. When Ratched tells the inmates that &quot;the best thing we can do is to go on with our daily routine&quot;, McMurphy attacks her in a fit of rage, nearly strangling her. Ratched has McMurphy lobotomized in retribution. However, McMurphy&#x27;s attack leaves Ratched weakened and bruised, and she loses her absolute control over the ward because the patients no longer fear her.

==Other portrayals==

A stage adaptation by Dale Wasserman made its Broadway debut in 1963 with Joan Tetzel as Nurse Ratched. Amy Morton portrayed Ratched in the 2001 Broadway revival.

The character was portrayed by Louise Fletcher in the film adaptation, whose performance earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress. Fletcher, who, up to that point, had only had a brief television career in the 1950s and early 1960s and had only appeared in two films (one uncredited), was cast after Anne Bancroft, Angela Lansbury, Geraldine Page, Colleen Dewhurst, and Ellen Burstyn turned down the role. Director Miloš Forman considered Fletcher for Ratched when he saw her in the 1974 film &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;.

Nurse Ratched was a recurring character in the ABC series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; from 2012 through 2017. She was portrayed by Ingrid Torrance and works for the Evil Queen as a nurse in the Storybrooke Sanitarium.

Nurse Ratched is played by actor Michael St Michaels and its featured in the music video called Choosing Mental Illness by the metal band &quot;Philip H. Anselmo &amp; The Illegals&quot;. The band is fronted by Pantera singer Phil Anselmo. Anselmo plays Jack Nicholson&#x27;s character in the music video.

Sarah Paulson portrays Nurse Ratched in Ryan Murphy&#x27;s Netflix television series &quot;Ratched&quot;, a prequel to the &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; film, the first season of which debuted September 18, 2020. Isabelle JoLynn Murphy portrays a young Ratched.

==Legacy==
Fletcher won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Ratched in the film. Ratched was named the fifth-greatest villain in film history (and second-greatest villainess, behind the Wicked Witch of the West of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;) by the American Film Institute in their series 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains.

<text>&quot;die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen&quot; (usual English translation: &quot;On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude&quot;) is a 9-page paper by Bernhard Riemann published in the November 1859 edition of the &quot;Monatsberichte der Königlich Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin&quot;.

==Overview==
This paper studies the prime-counting function using analytic methods. Although it is the only paper Riemann ever published on number theory, it contains ideas which influenced thousands of researchers during the late 19th century and up to the present day. The paper consists primarily of definitions, heuristic arguments, sketches of proofs, and the application of powerful analytic methods; all of these have become essential concepts and tools of modern analytic number theory.

Among the new definitions, ideas, and notation introduced:
*The use of the Greek letter zeta (ζ) for a function previously mentioned by Euler
*The analytic continuation of this zeta function ζ(&quot;s&quot;) to all complex &quot;s&quot; ≠ 1
*The entire function ξ(&quot;s&quot;), related to the zeta function through the gamma function (or the Π function, in Riemann&#x27;s usage)
*The discrete function &quot;J&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) defined for &quot;x&quot; ≥ 0, which is defined by &quot;J&quot;(0) = 0 and &quot;J&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) jumps by 1/&quot;n&quot; at each prime power &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;. (Riemann calls this function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).)

Among the proofs and sketches of proofs:
*Two proofs of the functional equation of ζ(&quot;s&quot;)
*Proof sketch of the product representation of ξ(&quot;s&quot;)
*Proof sketch of the approximation of the number of roots of ξ(&quot;s&quot;) whose imaginary parts lie between 0 and &quot;T&quot;.

Among the conjectures made:
*The Riemann hypothesis, that all (nontrivial) zeros of ζ(&quot;s&quot;) have real part 1/2. Riemann states this in terms of the roots of the related ξ function, That is, (He was discussing a version of the zeta function, modified so that its roots are real rather than on the critical line.)

New methods and techniques used in number theory:
*Functional equations arising from automorphic forms
*Analytic continuation (although not in the spirit of Weierstrass)
*Contour integration
*Fourier inversion.

Riemann also discussed the relationship between ζ(&quot;s&quot;) and the distribution of the prime numbers, using the function &quot;J&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) essentially as a measure for Stieltjes integration. He then obtained the main result of the paper, a formula for &quot;J&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), by comparing with ln(ζ(&quot;s&quot;)). Riemann then found a formula for the prime-counting function (&quot;x&quot;) (which he calls &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)). He notes that his equation explains the fact that (&quot;x&quot;) grows more slowly than the logarithmic integral, as had been found by Carl Friedrich Gauss and Carl Wolfgang Benjamin Goldschmidt.

The paper contains some peculiarities for modern readers, such as the use of Π(&quot;s&quot; − 1) instead of Γ(&quot;s&quot;), writing &quot;tt&quot; instead of &quot;t&quot;2, and using the bounds of ∞ to ∞ as to denote a contour integral.

<text>Red Hook is a neighborhood in western Brooklyn, New York City, United States, within the area once known as South Brooklyn. It is located on a peninsula projecting into the Upper New York Bay and is bounded by the Gowanus Expressway and the Carroll Gardens neighborhood on the northeast, Gowanus Canal on the east, and the Upper New York Bay on the west and south. A prosperous shipping and port area in the early 20th century, the area declined in the latter part of the century. Today, it is home to the Red Hook Houses, the largest housing project in Brooklyn.

Red Hook is part of Brooklyn Community District 6, and its primary ZIP Code is 11231. It is patrolled by the 76th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically, Red Hook is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 38th District.

==History==
===Colonization===
The native Lenape referred to the region as , meaning a high point of sandy soil. The village was settled by Dutch colonists of New Amsterdam in 1636, and named , after the red clay soil and the point of land projecting into the Upper New York Bay. In Dutch, means &quot;point&quot; or &quot;corner&quot;, and not the English hook (, something curved or bent). The actual of Red Hook was a point on an island that stuck out into Upper New York Bay at today&#x27;s Dikeman Street west of Ferris Street. In 1657, became part of the Town of Brooklyn.

Rapelye Street in Red Hook commemorates the beginnings of one of New Amsterdam&#x27;s earliest families, the Rapelje clan, descended from the first European child born in the new Dutch settlement in the New World, Sarah Rapelje. She was born near Wallabout Bay, which later became the site of the New York (Brooklyn) Naval Shipyard. A couple of decades after the birth of his daughter Sarah, Joris Jansen Rapelje removed to Brooklyn, where he was one of the Council of twelve men, and where he was soon joined by son-in-law Hans Hansen Bergen. Rapelye Street in Red Hook is named for Rapelje and his descendants, who lived in Brooklyn for centuries.

===American Revolution===
During the Battle of Brooklyn (also known as the Battle of Long Island), Fort Defiance was constructed on the &quot;hoek&quot;. It is shown on a map called &quot;a Map of the Environs of Brooklyn&quot; drawn in 1780 by Loyalist engineer George S. Sproule. The Sproule map shows that the Fort Defiance complex consisted of three redoubts on a small island connected by trenches, with an earthwork on the island&#x27;s south side to defend against a landing. The entire earthwork was about long and covered the entire island. The three redoubts covered an area about by . The two principal earthworks were about by , and the tertiary one was about by . Maps from Sproule and Bernard Ratzer show that Red Hook was a low-lying area full of tidal mill ponds created by the Dutch.

General Israel Putnam came to New York on April 4, 1776, to assess the state of its defenses and strengthen them. Among the works initiated were forts on Governor&#x27;s Island and Red Hook, facing the bay. On April 10, one thousand Continentals took possession of both points and began constructing Fort Defiance which mounted one three pounder cannon and four eighteen pounders. The cannons were to be fired over the tops of the fort&#x27;s walls. In May, George Washington described it as &quot;small but exceedingly strong&quot;. On July 5, General Nathanael Greene called it &quot;a post of vast importance&quot; and, three days later, Col. Varnum&#x27;s regiment joined its garrison. On July 12, the British frigates &quot;Rose&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot; and the schooner &quot;Tyrol&quot; ran the gauntlet past Defiance and the stronger Governor&#x27;s Island works without firing a shot, and got all the way to Tappan Zee. They stayed there for over a month, beating off harassing attacks, and finally returned to Staten Island on August 18. It appeared that gunfire from Fort Defiance did damage to the British ships.

Samuel Shaw wrote to his parents on July 15:

Almost the entire New York metropolitan area was under British military occupation from the end of 1776 until November 23, 1783, when they evacuated the city.

===Industrial era===

In the 1840s, entrepreneurs began to build ports as the &quot;offloading end&quot; of the Erie Canal. These included the Atlantic Basin, dredged in 1850, and the Erie Basin, dredged in 1864. Simultaneously, in 1849, the New York Legislature granted permission to dredge the nearby Gowanus Creek so it could be used as a commercial waterway connected to Upper New York Bay. The creek&#x27;s dredging was completed in 1860. Another act of the Legislature in 1867 allowed the canal to be deepened further. With the completion of the creek&#x27;s dredging, Red Hook became an industrial hub, seeing up to 26,000 ships per year.

Dockworkers of various ethnicities began settling in Red Hook. African-American dockworkers began to move to Red Hook in the 1890s, while Italians had settled around Columbia Street. Many dockworkers lived in boarding houses, some of which had been speculatively built rowhouses. The industrial development also gave way to haphazard shanty towns. By the mid-1880s, a &quot;Slab City&quot; of 2,000 squatters and several hundred livestock had developed around Hamilton Avenue.

By the early 20th century, Red Hook had gained a reputation of decay, with organized crime having started to develop in the area. From the 1920s on, many poor and unemployed Norwegians, mostly former sailors, were living in the area in what they called &quot;Ørkenen Sur&quot; (&quot;The Bitter Desert&quot;) around places like Hamilton Avenue and Gospel Hill. In 2015, NRK made a documentary about it in Norwegian. There is also an old documentary film about this.

===Investment and decline===
In the 1930s, the area was poor, and the site of the current Red Hook Houses was the site of a shack city for the homeless called a &quot;Hooverville&quot;. Officials began looking to revitalize Red Hook at that time. The Red Hook Play Center and Red Hook Recreational Area opened in 1936 and 1940, respectively. The Red Hook Houses were completed in 1939.

In the 1990s, &quot;Life&quot; magazine named Red Hook as one of the &quot;worst&quot; neighborhoods in the United States and as &quot;the crack capital of America&quot;. Patrick Daly, the principal of P.S. 15 in Red Hook, was killed in 1992 in the crossfire of a drug-related shooting while looking for a pupil who had left his school. The school was later renamed the Patrick Daly School after him, who was beloved within the school.
In 2010, Red Hook&#x27;s first community newspaper, &quot;The Red Hook Star-Revue&quot;, began publication. Red Hook was heavily damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, two years later. In 2024, the New York City government took over about of land on Red Hook&#x27;s waterfront, with plans to redevelop it.

The &quot;Mary A. Whalen&quot; and &quot;Lehigh Valley Railroad Barge No. 79&quot; are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Location==
Red Hook is a peninsula between Buttermilk Channel, Gowanus Bay, and Gowanus Canal at the southern edge of Downtown Brooklyn. Red Hook is in the area known as South Brooklyn, which, contrary to its name, is actually in western Brooklyn. This name is derived from the original City of Brooklyn which ended at Atlantic Street, now Atlantic Avenue. By the 1950s, anything south of Atlantic Avenue was considered South Brooklyn; thus, the names &quot;Red Hook&quot; and &quot;South Brooklyn&quot; were applied also to today&#x27;s Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Columbia Heights, and Gowanus neighborhoods. Portions of Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill were granted landmark status in the 1970s and were carved out of Red Hook.

Red Hook is the only part of New York City that has a fully frontal view of the Statue of Liberty, which was oriented to face France. (France gave the statue to the United States following the US centennial).

Red Hook is the site of the NYCHA Red Hook Houses, the largest public housing development in Brooklyn, which accommodates about 6,000 people. Red Hook also contains several parks, including Red Hook Park. The park is in the vicinity, if not the exact location, of where the celebrated Civil War era baseball team Excelsior of Brooklyn played many of their home games. The neighborhood contains a heritage trail recalling its portion of the Battle of Brooklyn in the revolutionary war.

===IKEA===

Red Hook has a large IKEA store () that opened on June 18, 2008, near the Gowanus Expressway. The building of IKEA was controversial. Opponents cited concerns including traffic congestion, a decrease in property values and destruction of this transit-oriented neighborhood and historically significant buildings in the area. Brooklyn artist Greg Lindquist exhibited a group of paintings in February 2008 in New York City that depicted the IKEA site in process, juxtaposing the maritime decay with the new construction.

As part of the IKEA development, a number of Civil War era buildings were demolished and the Red Hook graving dock, a 19th-century dry dock still in use, was filled in and leveled for use as a parking lot. A Maritime Support Services Location Study by the New York City Economic Development Corporation found that New York City needed eight more dry docks. According to the report, it would cost $1 billion to replace the one sold to IKEA, although no schedule for replacement was announced. In addition, IKEA&#x27;s contractor was found to be in &quot;violation for not having filed asbestos work, failing to monitor the air, not posting warnings, failure to construct decontamination protections before disturbing the asbestos-containing materials, and doing nothing to protect and decontaminate the material, as well as the workers and building waste.&quot;

New York Water Taxi began operation of a ferry route to the IKEA store in Red Hook when it opened in 2008; the free service was implemented as a measure to improve transportation access to the new store but was not limited to use by store customers. The overall demand for the ferry by shoppers and non-shoppers was so high that the following year a $5 fare was charged for the service on weekdays, except for passengers that spent more than $10 in the store. Ferry service on weekends remained free of charge. The ferry service was taken over by NY Waterway in 2021 and remains free, but now only operates on weekends.

As late as 2000, 43% of the neighborhood&#x27;s population was Black, and nearly half identified as Hispanic of Latino. Between 2000 and 2016, the ratio of white residents increased by 320%. According to a 2016 U.S. Census estimate, Red Hook&#x27;s population was 31% white and 35% Black; in addition, 44% of residents identified as Hispanic or Latino of any race.

==Transportation==

===Water===
Red Hook has been served by NYC Ferry&#x27;s South Brooklyn route since 2017. NY Waterway operates a free ferry service between the IKEA store, Wall St/Pier 11, and Midtown/Pier 79 on weekends; the route was previously operated by New York Water Taxi and began operation in 2008 in conjunction with the store&#x27;s opening.

The transatlantic liner docks in Red Hook. In spring 2006, a new Carnival Cruise Lines terminal, the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal, opened at Pier 12 at Pioneer Street, bringing additional tourists.

The Red Hook Container Terminal is one of four such facilities in the Port of New York and New Jersey and is the only maritime facility in Brooklyn to handle container ships.

===Public transport===

Subway service in the area is sparse. The closest subway stops are along the IND Culver Line (), at either Carroll Street or Smith–Ninth Streets stations.

New York City Bus service is also sparse, but popular. The B61 bus route provides service from Hamilton Avenue, through Erie Basin/IKEA Plaza, to Van Brunt Street and then northward, through the Columbia Street Waterfront District and terminates in Downtown Brooklyn. It also connects with the Culver Line&#x27;s Smith–Ninth Streets station. The B57 bus connects Red Hook with Downtown Brooklyn and Maspeth, Queens.

IKEA provides a complimentary shuttle that runs to Smith–Ninth Streets, Fourth Avenue / Ninth Street, and Court Street – Borough Hall subway stations from 3 to 9 pm daily, Monday through Friday every half hour, and Saturday and Sunday from 11 am to 9 pm every 20 minutes. Non-shoppers also use this service.

====Streetcar project====
Although electric trolleys have not run in Brooklyn since 1956, activists led by the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association (BHRA) have been trying to revive streetcars in Red Hook since 1989. With permission from New York City&#x27;s government to develop a streetcar line running from Beard Street to Borough Hall, in the 1990s BHRA president Robert Diamond collected disused PCC streetcars that had been used in Boston and Buffalo for potential use on the new line. By 1999, Diamond had begun laying new track for the project, but in 2003 transportation officials elected to revoke Diamond&#x27;s rights to the route&#x27;s right of way, instead intending to sell them to the highest bidder in the event that the project ever moved forward. Diamond&#x27;s efforts to secure independent funding were not successful.

In 2005, Rep. Nydia Velázquez helped obtain a $300,000 federal grant for a six-month streetcar study. Although BHRA had estimated $10–$15 million would be required to complete the project, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) streetcar feasibility study (completed in April 2011) concluded that the line would cost $176 million in capital funding, plus an additional $6.2 to $7.2 million in annual operating funds. A significant portion of the capital cost would be required to make modifications to Red Hook&#x27;s narrow streets in order to allow streetcars to make right turns. The study ultimately found that the streetcar was not feasible because of high costs, potentially low ridership, and physical constraints like narrow streets.

In January 2016, a new proposal for a streetcar line in Red Hook, called the Brooklyn–Queens Connector, was made public by a non-profit group named Friends of the Brooklyn Queens Connector. The study proposed a route between the neighborhoods of Astoria in Queens and Sunset Park in Brooklyn, passing through several neighborhoods on the way, including Red Hook. The private results of the study estimated that the streetcar&#x27;s construction would cost $1.7 billion and would serve 15.8 million annual riders by 2035. In February 2016, the office of Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would begin planning work for the streetcar line. However, although a list of possible routings for the streetcar was released in November 2016, there was insufficient funding to start construction. By August 2018, the southern terminal of the proposed streetcar had been truncated to Red Hook and the proposed cost rose to $2.73 billion, with projected completion postponed to 2029.

===Vehicular===

Red Hook is connected to Manhattan by the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel, whose approaches separate it from Carroll Gardens and Columbia Street to the north. The tunnel&#x27;s toll plaza was formerly located in Red Hook but was removed in 2017, replaced by electronic toll collection gantries on the Manhattan side of the tunnel.

The Gowanus Expressway (Interstate 278) also runs through the neighborhood.

==Events==

The Red Hook Waterfront Arts Festival is an annual summer kick-off held in Louis J. Valentino, Jr. Park &amp; Pier featuring dance, music, and spoken-word poetry. Dance Theatre Etcetera, the producers of the event, concentrate local resources for residents and bring in community partners with activities for the whole family.

Sundays at Sunny&#x27;s is a reading series held the first Sunday of every month, co-sponsored by Sunny&#x27;s Bar and the independent bookstore BookCourt, and co-ordinated by writer Gabriel Cohen.

Red Hook Crit is an annual, unsanctioned bicycle race held on a springtime night on track bikes. It began as an underground event but has grown to become &quot;what is possibly the country&#x27;s coolest bike race.&quot;

The Brooklyn Street Circuit is located in Red Hook and hosts the annual New York City ePrix.

<text>The Austrian Netherlands was the territory of the Burgundian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire between 1714 and 1797. The period began with the acquisition by the Austrian Habsburg monarchy of the former Spanish Netherlands under the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714. It lasted until Revolutionary France annexed the territory after the Battle of Sprimont in 1794 and the Peace of Basel in 1795. Austria relinquished its claim on the province in 1797 through the Treaty of Campo Formio.

==History==

The Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648) later led to a division of the Low Countries between the Dutch Republic in the north and the Southern Netherlands, which later became Belgium and Luxembourg. The area had been held by the Habsburgs, but was briefly under Bourbon control in the War of the Spanish Succession. Under the Treaty of Rastatt (1714) which ended that war, the remainder of the Spanish Netherlands was ceded to Austria. Administratively, the country was divided into four traditional duchies, three counties and various lordships.

=== Brabant Revolution ===

In the 1780s, opposition emerged to the liberal reforms of Emperor Joseph II, which were perceived as an attack on the Catholic Church and the traditional institutions of the Austrian Netherlands. Resistance grew, focused in the autonomous and wealthy Duchy of Brabant and County of Flanders. In the aftermath of rioting and disruption in 1787 known as the Small Revolution, many opponents took refuge in the neighboring Dutch Republic where they formed a rebel army. Soon after the outbreak of the French and Liège revolutions, the &quot;émigré&quot; army crossed into the Austrian Netherlands and decisively defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Turnhout on 27 October 1789. The rebels, supported by uprisings across the territory, soon took control over much of the territory and proclaimed independence. Despite the tacit support of Prussia, the independent United Belgian States, established in January 1790, received no foreign recognition and soon became divided along ideological lines. The Vonckists led by Jan Frans Vonck advocated progressive and liberal government, whereas the Statists, led by Hendrik Van der Noot, were staunchly conservative and supported by the Church. The Statists, who had a wider base of support, drove the Vonckists into exile through terror.

By mid-1790, Habsburg Austria ended its war with the Ottoman Empire and prepared to suppress the rebels. The new Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold II, was also a liberal and proposed an amnesty for the rebels. After defeating a Statist army at the Battle of Falmagne (22 September 1790), the territory was soon overrun and the revolution was defeated by December. The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived and the territory was overrun by the French in 1794 (during the War of the First Coalition) after the 
Battle of Fleurus.

=== Imperial Council of State===
The Council of State acted as government, and formed the council by imperial consent:

* Baron , Imperial Diplomat
* Cardinal Christoph Bartholomäus Anton Migazzi
* Cardinal von Frankenberg
* Baron of , Imperial Lord Chamberlain
* Philippe von Cobenzl, vice Chancellor of the Imperial Council of State.
* Henri d&#x27;Ognies, Prince of Grimberghen, Imperial Lord Chamberlain
* Count of Neny president of the Privy Council, member of the Imperial Council of State
* Count of Woestenraedt, Imperial Lord Chamberlain.
* Marquess of Chasteler, Lord Chamberlain
* Count of Gommegnies, President of the Council of Hainaut
* Viscount of Villers; Imperial Treasurer General
* Franz Joseph, Prince of Gavre: Grand Marshall of the Imperial Court of the Archduchess.

==French rule==

1794 was the third year of the War of the First Coalition. The Austrians gave up on contesting the Low Countries after the Battle of Fleurus (26 June), and left them to the French. After three months of military occupation, on 15 October a Central High Administration of Belgium was installed. On 1 October 1795 the departments were activated and the definitive annexation started, liquidating the Belgian Governing Council, which ceased on 22 November. France annexed the Austrian Netherlands from the Holy Roman Empire and integrated them into the French Republic. The commissioner of the Directory, 
, finished his work on January 20, 1797, after which no common Belgian authority remained.

<text>Excite is an American website (historically a web portal) operated by IAC that provides outsourced internet content such as a metasearch engine, with outsourced weather and news content on the main page. As of 2024, all of Excite&#x27;s operations are controlled by services outside of the business.

In the United States, the main Excite homepage had historically a personal start page and web portal called My Excite. Excite once operated a webmail service commonly known as Excite Mail until August 31, 2021.

The original Excite company was founded in 1994 and went public two years later. Excite was once a popular site on the Internet during the 1990s, with the main portal site Excite.com being the sixth most visited website in 1997. The company merged with broadband provider @Home Network but together went bankrupt in 2001. Excite&#x27;s portal and services were acquired by iWon and then by Ask Jeeves, but the website went into a steep decline in popularity afterwards.

== History ==
Excite originally started as Architext in June 1993 in Cupertino, California, created by Graham Spencer, Joe Kraus, Mark VanHaren, Ryan McIntyre, Ben Lutch and Martin Reinfried, who were all students at Stanford University. The goal was to create software to manage the vast information on the World Wide Web. In July 1994, International Data Group paid them US$80,000 to develop an online service. In January 1995, Vinod Khosla, a former Stanford student and partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, arranged a US$250,000 &quot;first round&quot; backing for the project, with US$1.5 million provided over a ten-month period. Soon thereafter, Geoff Yang, of Institutional Venture Partners, introduced an additional US$1.5 million in financing and Excite was formally launched in October 1995.

In January 1996, George Bell joined Excite as its chief executive officer (CEO). Excite also purchased two search engines (Magellan and WebCrawler) and signed exclusive distribution agreements with Netscape, Microsoft and Apple, in addition to other companies. Jim Bellows, then 72, was hired by Excite in 1994 to figure out how to present the content in a journalistic manner. He paid good journalists to write brief reviews of web sites. However, users wanted to get directly to the content and skipped the reviews, so the partnership with Bellows ended in 1998. Excite&#x27;s original website design was mostly based on the color orange. In 1997 it was redesigned with a black and yellow theme, which mostly continues to this day.

On April 4, 1996, Excite went public with an initial offering of two million shares. Its offering was however overshadowed by its biggest rival, Yahoo!, which also went public at the same time. Excite&#x27;s six founders became millionaires after the offering. In November 1996, America Online (AOL) agreed to make Excite its exclusive search and directory service, in return of a larger 20 percent share in Excite and sale of WebCrawler. In June 1997, Intuit, maker of Quicken and TurboTax, purchased a 19% stake in Excite and finalised a seven-year partnership deal. On October 16, 1997, Excite purchased Netbot, a comparison shopping agent. At the same time Intuit announced the launch of Excite Business &amp; Investing. Later that year a deal was finalized with Ticketmaster to provide direct online ticketing. On March 31, 1998, Excite reported a net loss of approximately $30.2 million and according to its first quarter report it had only enough available capital to meet obligations through December. Content from Excite&#x27;s portal was collated from over 100 different sources. Excite was the first portal to start offering free e-mail, and this step was followed by rivals Yahoo! and Lycos.

A November 1997 press release showed that there were about 11.8 million unique visitors to the Excite &quot;network&quot; during a 28-day period from September to October.

Around this time, Excite was monetized with online advertising that corresponded to the number of &quot;eyeballs&quot; that visited the portal.

In December 1998, Yahoo! was in negotiations to purchase Excite for $5.5 billion to $6 billion. However, prompted by Kleiner Perkins, @Home Network&#x27;s chairman and CEO, Thomas Jermoluk met with Excite&#x27;s chairman and CEO George Bell on December 19, and Excite was subsequently acquired by @Home Network, on January 19, 1999. At this time, Excite was the sixth largest Internet portal by traffic. At one point, Microsoft was also interested in Excite, and had plans to merge it into its own MSN portal.

According to Steven Levy in his book &quot;In The Plex&quot;, in early 1997 two graduate students at Stanford University, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, decided that BackRub, the name of their research project that later became the search engine Google, was taking up time they should have been using to study. They went to Bell and offered it to him for $1 million, but Bell rejected the offer, and later threw Vinod Khosla, one of Excite&#x27;s venture capitalists, out of his office after he had negotiated Brin and Page down to $750,000. In a 2014 podcast and later again to CNBC, then-CEO of Excite, George Bell, said that the deal fell apart because Larry Page wanted Excite&#x27;s search technologies to be replaced by Google&#x27;s, to which Bell did not agree.

===Excite@Home===

The US$6.7 billion merger of Excite and @Home Network in 1999 (equivalent to $ billion in ) became one of the largest mergers of two Internet companies at the time. @Home&#x27;s high-speed Internet services and existing portal were combined with Excite&#x27;s search engine and portal, with a move towards personalised web portal content following the merger. The new company was named &quot;Excite@Home&quot; (the stock symbol and the company&#x27;s name in regulatory filing records remained as &quot;At Home Corporation&quot; (ATHM)) and, six months after the merger, Tom Jermoluk stepped down as CEO of Excite@Home. Excite&#x27;s George Bell, who was the president of the Excite division of @Home after the merger, became the new CEO of the combined Excite@Home, whilst Jermoluk remained the chairman of the board. The merger was billed as a &quot;new media network for the 21st century.&quot;

Following the merger, the Excite division purchased iMall, as well as online greeting card company, Blue Mountain Arts. Excite also acquired photo sharing company Webshots. Excite furthermore paid for sponsorship of Infiniti Indy car driver Eddie Cheever, Jr., through the 2000 and 2001 racing seasons. However, the merger between Excite and @Home fell disastrously short of expectations. Online advertising revenue plummeted, while cable network ISP revenue continued to grow. On September 21, 2000, after stock value had dropped 90%, George Bell announced plans to step down as CEO within six months. On April 23, 2001, Excite@Home announced Patti S. Hart, the former CEO of Telocity, would become its third CEO in three years. In the same announcement, George Bell resigned and left the company completely. The company also reported first-quarter net loss of $61.6 million, compared with a loss of $4.6 million in the same period the prior year.

The search engine Magellan, which Excite had purchased in 1996, was closed down in May 2001.

On June 11, 2001, Excite@Home announced that it had raised $100 million in financing from Promethean Capital Management and Angelo Gordon &amp; Co. Part of the deal was that the loan was repayable immediately if Excite@Home stock was delisted by NASDAQ. The loan, structured as a note convertible into shares of Excite, had an interest rate of zero. By August 20 of that year, Excite@Home had replaced its auditors Ernst &amp; Young with PricewaterhouseCoopers. This triggered a demand from Promethean Capital Management and Angelo Gordon &amp; Co for the immediate repayment of $50 million in debt. Furthermore, Cox Cable and Comcast announced that they would separate from Excite@Home by the first quarter of 2002.

On September 13, 2001, Excite@Home sold Blue Mountain Arts to American Greetings for less than 5% of what it had paid less than two years earlier. On October 1, 2001, Excite@Home filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. The company&#x27;s remaining 1,350 employees were laid off over the following months. As part of the agreement, @Home&#x27;s national high-speed fiber network access would be sold back to AT&amp;T Corporation. @Home Liquidating Trust became the successor company to Excite@Home, charged with the sale of all assets of the former company.

At the end of 2001, the Webshots assets were purchased by the company&#x27;s founders for $2.4 million in cash from the Bankruptcy Court.

Despite the financial problems, the Excite network of sites continued to draw many visitors in the U.S., albeit behind AOL Time Warner, Microsoft and Yahoo!

===Excite Network===
During the collapse of Excite@Home, iWon, an Irvington, New York–based venture, had surreptitiously commenced the design of a new Excite website; iWon planned to acquire the Excite.com domain name and brand in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings. iWon eventually made a joint bid with Seattle&#x27;s InfoSpace to purchase the domain name and brand. On November 28, 2001, the court accepted the bid and gave iWon less than three weeks to launch a new Excite portal. Bill Daugherty, iWon&#x27;s founder and co-chief executive at the time, told &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;I feel like a guy who lived through a hurricane, got pounded and pounded and managed to survive when everyone else was destroyed. Suddenly you walk outside and because of the storm you have beachfront property. That&#x27;s what Excite is to us.&quot;

On December 16, 2001, iWon launched the new Excite portal and transferred millions of Excite users to its new home. iWon changed its corporate name to &quot;Excite Network&quot;, and continued to operate Excite, iWon, and a third portal, MyWay. Outside of the United States, Excite Italia took control of portals in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, and Austria. InfoSpace, for its part, owned and operated the web search function on Excite, with Excite&#x27;s own database now depreciated and instead using Overture and Inktomi search results, along with DMOZ (Open Directory) for the directory and Dogpile metasearch for news results. This proved to be a short-sighted arrangement as searching became big business on the Internet in the ensuing years.

===Acquisition by Ask Jeeves===
Excite continued to operate until the Excite Network was acquired by Ask Jeeves (now Ask.com) in March 2004. Ask Jeeves promised to rejuvenate iWon and Excite, but was not able to. Ask Jeeves management became distracted, according to the &quot;East Bay Business Times&quot;, first by a search feature arms race with Google and Yahoo!, and then by its merger with Barry Diller&#x27;s IAC/InterActiveCorp, announced in March 2005. &quot;Hopefully, as we start to invest more and get the staff in place and some of the changes to the portal properties that we want, we hope to see (revenue) grow back in the latter half of the year,&quot; said Ask Jeeves CEO Steve Berkowitz during a conference call with analysts on April 27, 2005.

On May 20, 2005, Ask Jeeves made two announcements regarding the rejuvenation of the Excite brand. It first announced that it had acquired Excite Italia B.V. (the operator of the Excite portals in Europe), from Tiscali, S.p.A.; and, secondly, the company reported that it had reached a comprehensive settlement with InfoSpace regarding Excite in the United States, whereby Ask Jeeves and InfoSpace would share marketing costs and revenue from the Excite web search function. Regarding the acquisition, Ask Jeeves CEO, Steve Berkowitz, said, &quot;We look forward to working with InfoSpace to enhance the search experience on Excite, now that our interests are aligned.&quot; On October 17, 2007, GOADV, a media company specialising in the generation of Internet &quot;traffic&quot;, announced the completion of its acquisition of the European Excite group of companies.

Excite has never managed to recover back to its heyday popularity. It remains more relevant in Japan, however. Excite Japan, headquartered in Tokyo, was founded on August 4, 1997 in a partnership with Itochu. After Excite@Home&#x27;s collapse, Itochu became majority shareholder of Excite Japan (90 percent).

Excite ended support for their webmail service on August 31, 2021. Those who already had accounts were offered to pay for a BlueTie Home e-mail account to keep their messages and contacts.

==Other services==
===FreeLane by Excite===
In a bid to compete against Internet Service Providers like NetZero and Juno Online, which offered free or low-cost dial-up access in the United States, Excite started offering its own &quot;no-pay&quot; service for private customers by partnering with 1stUp.com to create FreeLane by Excite: 1stUp would allow Excite customers to download software in order for them to be able to log-on to the Internet. The software would then rotate a series of sponsored banner advertisements on the user&#x27;s computer while they surfed the Internet. 1stUp.com soon went out of business, and Excite switched to another partner named WorldShare, rebranding FreeLane as FreeLane version 2.0. As of March 1, 2001, FreeLane was discontinued.

===Ticketsmate===
Ticketsmate, in partnership with Excite, sells tickets to customers in the United States. The portal is essentially a ticket selling website where users can buy tickets and search through thousands of events and venues. The powerful search engine capabilities of the Excite server are used on this website to help the user search for tickets and events.

=== Excite Education (HigherEdu.com) ===
Excite also has an education portal called HigherEdu.com that can be used by people to search for and apply for different degrees and online courses. The portal was originally called Excite Education and it once featured a list of thousands of educational institutes across America for prospective students to browse through and apply at but now features a much smaller list. The popularity of HigherEdu.com has declined along with the main Excite portal.

<text>Kevin Francis Shelley (born November 16, 1955) is an American politician, who was the 28th California Secretary of State from January 6, 2003, until his resignation on March 4, 2005.

==Early life==

Shelley was raised in San Francisco, the only son in a family of five. His father, Jack Shelley, was a State Senator, member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and Mayor of San Francisco.

Shelley graduated from St. Ignatius College Preparatory in 1973. He received his B.A. in political science from the University of California, Davis. He obtained his J.D. from University of California, Hastings College of the Law. He joined the staff of Congressman Phillip Burton and continued in his position when Sala Burton assumed her husband&#x27;s seat after his death.

==Political career==
In 1990, Shelley was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. In 1996, he won a seat in the California State Assembly. He wrote clinic protection ordinances and sunshine laws to make government more accountable. He authored the Marine Life Protection Act that protects coastal ecosystems, the California Nursing Home Reform Act to protect the elderly, and the Healthy Schools Act to protect children from pesticides. He created a voting reform package that includes a Voters&#x27; Bill of Rights and allows each voter to permanently vote by mail.
Term limits prevented Shelley from seeking a fourth term as an Assemblyman in 2002, so he sought election as California&#x27;s Secretary of State, the state&#x27;s chief elections official.

===Recall election===

Within weeks of Shelley&#x27;s taking office as Secretary of State, petitions were filed to recall Governor Gray Davis, a fellow Democrat. Six months after taking office, Shelley had to certify that there were enough signatures on these petitions to mandate the 2003 gubernatorial recall election, the first such election in state history. As Secretary of State, Shelley was responsible for overseeing that statewide special election.

Shelley was generally credited with good work on his handling of the 2003 recall election and on his handling of the controversy over the verifiability of electronic voting machines. He was the first state election official to decertify DRE voting machine systems already in use, to require all DRE voting machine systems to contain an accessible paper copy of a person&#x27;s vote, and to adopt standards and security measures for such systems. He initiated an investigation into electronic voting machine manufacturer Diebold Election Systems (now Premier Election Solutions), and at the conclusion of the investigation, requested that then-State Attorney General Bill Lockyer investigate Diebold for criminal fraud.

===Scandals===
A number of former staffers and other associates came forward and accused Shelley of abusive behavior toward his staff.

Other accusations surfaced charging Shelley had received allegedly laundered campaign funds during his race for Secretary of State. Shelley maintained that he did not know that the funds were illicitly transferred to his campaign treasury. (After an investigation, then-state Attorney General Bill Lockyer publicly exonerated Shelley, saying he was innocent of any wrongdoing in connection with the case.)

On October 29, 2004, Shelley replaced three of his top aides, including the assistant state secretary of communications, with veteran civil servants, in an effort to bring more accountability to his office. 
Shelley announced his resignation on February 4, 2005, effective March 1, although he did not leave office until three days later, on March 4.

Chief Deputy Secretary of State Cathy Mitchell briefly served as Secretary of State until Bruce McPherson, a Republican, was appointed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Upon taking office, McPherson reversed Shelley&#x27;s actions, and on March 10, 2006, McPherson certified the use of DRE voting machines without verifiable, auditable paper trails.

California State Bar records indicate Shelley resumed practicing law in April 2005.

<text>Yom HaZikaron laShoah ve-laG&#x27;vurah (), known colloquially in Israel and abroad as Yom HaShoah (, ) and in English as Holocaust Remembrance Day, or Holocaust Day, is observed as Israel&#x27;s day of commemoration for the approximately six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust by Nazi Germany and its collaborators, and for the Jewish resistance in that period. In Israel, it is a national memorial day. The first official commemorations took place in 1951, and the observance of the day was anchored in a law passed by the Knesset in 1959. It is held on the 27th of Nisan (which falls in April or May), unless the 27th would be adjacent to the Jewish Sabbath, in which case the date is shifted by a day.

==Origins==
===Rabbinate-instituted day (1949–1950)===
The first Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel took place on December 28, 1949, following a decision of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel that an annual memorial should take place on the Tenth of Tevet, a traditional day of mourning and fasting in the Hebrew calendar. The day was marked by the burial in a Jerusalem cemetery of ashes and bones of thousands of Jews brought from the Flossenbürg concentration camp and religious ceremonies held in honor of the victims. A radio program on the Holocaust was broadcast that evening. The following year, in December 1950, the Rabbinate, organizations of former European Jewish communities and the Israel Defense Forces held memorial ceremonies around the country; they mostly involved funerals, in which objects such as desecrated Torah scrolls and the bones and ashes of the dead brought from Europe were interred.

===Knesset-instituted day (1951–1958)===
In 1951, the Knesset began deliberations to choose a date for Holocaust Remembrance Day. On April 12, 1951, after also considering as possibilities the Tenth of Tevet, the 14th of Nisan, which is the day before Passover and the day on which the Warsaw Ghetto uprising (April 19, 1943) began, and September 1, the date on which the Second World War began, the Knesset passed a resolution establishing the 27 Nisan in the Hebrew calendar, a week after Passover, and eight days before Israel Independence Day as the annual &quot;Holocaust and Ghetto Uprising Remembrance Day&quot;.

On May 3, 1951, the first officially organized Holocaust Remembrance Day event was held at the Chamber of the Holocaust on Mount Zion; the Israel Postal Service issued a special commemorative envelope; and a bronze statue of Mordechai Anielewicz, the leader of the Warsaw Ghetto revolt, was unveiled at Yad Mordechai, a kibbutz named for him. From the following year, the lighting of six beacons in memory of the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis became a standard feature of the official commemoration of Holocaust Memorial Day.

===Martyrs&#x27; and Heroes&#x27; Remembrance Day Law (1959)===
On April 8, 1959, the Knesset officially established the day when it passed the &quot;Martyrs&#x27; and Heroes&#x27; Remembrance Day Law&quot; with the purpose of instituting an annual &quot;commemoration of the disaster which the Nazis and their collaborators brought upon the Jewish people and the acts of heroism and revolt performed.&quot; The law was signed by the Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion, and the President of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi. It established that the day would be observed by a two-minute silence when all work would come to a halt throughout the country, memorial gatherings and commemorative events in public and educational institutions would be held, flags would be flown at half mast, and programs relevant to the day would be presented on the radio and in places of entertainment. An amendment to the law in 1961 mandated that cafes, restaurants and clubs be closed on the day.

==Commemoration==
===Israel===
====Date====
The date is set in accordance with the Hebrew calendar, on 27 Nisan, so that it varies in regard to the Gregorian calendar. Observance of the day is moved back to the Thursday before, if 27 Nisan falls on a Friday (as in 2021), or forward a day, if 27 Nisan falls on a Sunday (to avoid adjacency with the Jewish Sabbath, as in 2024). The fixed Jewish calendar ensures 27 Nisan does not fall on Saturday.

====Evening====
Yom HaShoah opens in Israel at sundown in a state ceremony held in Warsaw Ghetto Square at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Martyrs&#x27; and Heroes Authority, in Jerusalem. During the ceremony the national flag is lowered to half mast, the President and the Prime Minister both deliver speeches, Holocaust survivors light six torches symbolizing the approximately six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust and the Chief Rabbis recite prayers.

====Daytime====
On Yom HaShoah, ceremonies and services are held at schools, military bases and by other public and community organizations.

On the eve of Yom HaShoah and the day itself, places of public entertainment are closed by law. Israeli television airs Holocaust documentaries and Holocaust-related talk shows, and low-key songs are played on the radio. Flags on public buildings are flown at half mast. At 10:00 a.m., an air raid siren sounds throughout the country and Israelis are expected to observe two minutes of solemn reflection. It is customary to pause what is being done and to reflect, including motorists who stop their cars in the middle of the road, standing beside their vehicles in silence as the siren is sounded.

===Abroad===
Jewish communities and individuals throughout the world commemorate Yom HaShoah in synagogues as well as in the broader Jewish community. Many hold their commemorative ceremonies on the closest Sunday to Yom HaShoah as a more practical day for people to attend, while some mark the day on April 19, the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Jewish schools also hold Holocaust-related educational programs on or near Yom HaShoah.

Commemorations typically include memorial services and communal vigils and educational programs. These programs often include talks by Holocaust survivors (although this is becoming less common as time passes and there are fewer survivors who remain alive), candle-lighting ceremonies, the recitation of memorial prayers, the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish and appropriate songs and readings. Some communities read the names of Holocaust victims or show Holocaust-themed films.

Since 1988 in Poland, a memorial service has been held after a three-kilometer walk by thousands of participants from Auschwitz to Birkenau in what has become known as &quot;The March of the Living&quot;.

Yom HaShoah is also commemorated by Australian Jews. In 2022, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who is Jewish, commemorated Yom HaShoah at the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation on the synagogue&#x27;s 180th anniversary.

While in Europe Holocaust Remembrance Day is celebrated on the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp by the Soviet military in 1945, the Israeli government chose to commemorate a day that honored Jewish resistance and heroism in the face of the Nazi genocide.

==Religious observances and liturgy==
In the last few decades all the prayerbooks of Conservative and Reform Judaism have developed similar liturgies to be used on Yom HaShoah. The siddurim of these groups add passages that are meant to be added to standard weekday service, as well as stand-alone sections. These liturgies generally include:

* Lighting of a candle (often each member of the congregation lights one)
* Modern poems, including &quot;I believe in the sun even when it is not shining...&quot;
* El Malei Rahamim (God, full of mercy, dwelling on high)
* Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish

In response to the lack of liturgy dedicated to Yom HaShoah, Daniel Gross composed, in 2009, &quot;I Believe: A Shoah Requiem&quot;, a complete musical liturgy dedicated to the observance of Yom HaShoah. An a cappella oratorio scored for cantor, soprano solo, adult chorus and children&#x27;s chorus, &quot;I Believe&quot; features several traditional prayer texts such as the Mourner&#x27;s Kaddish (&quot;Kaddish Yatom&quot;) and the &quot;El Malei&quot; memorial prayer, and also includes the poetry of Paul Celan and Primo Levi. On April 7, 2013, &quot;I Believe&quot; had its world premiere presentation at Orchestra Hall at the Max M. Fisher Music Center in Detroit, Michigan.

===Orthodox Judaism===
While there are Orthodox Jews who commemorate the Holocaust on Yom HaShoah, others in the Orthodox community, especially Haredim, including Hasidim, remember the victims of the Holocaust in their daily prayers and on traditional days of mourning that were already in place before the Holocaust, such as Tisha B&#x27;Av in the summer, and the Tenth of Tevet in the winter, because in the Jewish tradition the month of Nisan is considered a joyous month associated with Passover and messianic redemption. The moment of silence is by some purposely ignored because of the non-Jewish origins of this sort of memorial. Some Haredi rabbis recommend adding &quot;piyyutim&quot; (religious poems) about the Holocaust to the liturgy of Tisha B’Av; some adherents follow this advice.

===Conservative Judaism===

In 1981, members of the Federation of Jewish Men&#x27;s Clubs FJMC, a branch of the mainstream Conservative/Masorti movement, created a special memorial project specifically for Yom HaShoah. A dedicated yahrzeit candle was conceived, with yellow wax and a barbed-wire Star of David logo reminiscent of the armbands Jews were forced to wear during the Holocaust. This object has come to be known as the Yellow Candle. Approximately 200,000 candles are distributed around the world each year, along with relevant prayers and meditations.

In 1984, Conservative Rabbi David Golinkin wrote an article in &quot;Conservative Judaism&quot; journal suggesting a program of observance for the holiday, including fasting. In his article he noted that while private fasts are indeed prohibited during the month of Nisan (a major Orthodox objection to the placement of the day), communal fasts for tragedies befalling Jewish communities had indeed been declared throughout the pre-Modern period.

Another prominent Conservative Jewish figure shared the Orthodox sentiment about not adopting Yom HaShoah. Ismar Schorsch, former Chancellor of Conservative Judaism&#x27;s Jewish Theological Seminary of America held that Holocaust commemoration should take place on Tisha b&#x27;Av.

The Masorti (Conservative) movement in Israel has created &quot;Megillat HaShoah&quot;, a scroll and liturgical reading for Yom HaShoah. This publication was a joint project of Jewish leaders in Israel, the United States and Canada.

In 2011, the FJMC introduced a related Yellow Candle concept for use on &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; (The Night of Shattered Glass), November 9–10, commemorating the first organised Nazi pogrom of Jews in 1938, and other important Shoah commemoration dates. Called the Ner Katan, FJMC&#x27;s new version consists of six Yellow Candles provided for communal observances and ceremonies.

More recently Conservative rabbis and lay leaders in the US, Israel and Canada collaborated to write &quot;Megillat Hashoah&quot; (The Holocaust Scroll). It contains personal recollections of Holocaust survivors. A responsum was written by Rabbi Golinkin expressing the view that not only is it legitimate for the modern Jewish community to write a new scroll of mourning, it was also incumbent to do so.

===Reform Judaism===
Reform Jewish congregations have tended to commemorate the memory of the Holocaust either on International Holocaust Remembrance Day or on Yom HaShoah. These commemorations of the Holocaust have used a ceremony that is loosely modeled after a Passover Seder. The focus of the seder has changed with time. The earlier Holocaust seders commemorated the losses of the Holocaust through a reenactment events from the Holocaust and through the lighting of six yahrzeit candles to reflect the approximately 6 million Jews murdered. More modern Haggadot for Yom HaShoah, such as Gathering from the Whirlwind, have concentrated on renewal, remembrance, and the continuity of Jewish life.

In 1988 the American Reform movement published &quot;Six Days of Destruction&quot; (Elie Wiesel and Rabbi Albert Friedlander). Narratives from Holocaust survivors are juxtaposed with the six days of creation found in Genesis.

==Gregorian dates==

<text>Äänekoski () is a town in Finland. It is located in the Central Finland region, about north of Jyväskylä, the region&#x27;s capital city. Äänekoski has a population of , as of , and covers an area of of which , or 22%, is water. The population density is .

Neighbouring municipalities are Kannonkoski, Konnevesi, Laukaa, Saarijärvi, Uurainen, Vesanto and Viitasaari.

The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

The municipality of Äänekosken maalaiskunta was consolidated to Äänekoski in 1969 and the municipality of Konginkangas in 1993. The municipalities of Sumiainen and Suolahti were consolidated to Äänekoski in 2007.

== History ==

Äänekoski is named after the nearby rapids. Folk etymology connects the name to the word &quot;ääni&quot; &quot;sound&quot;, but Terho Itkonen has suggested another origin: a Sámi term meaning &quot;big, large&quot; (compare Northern Sámi &quot;eanas&quot;, &quot;most&quot;).

Swedish sources mention a salmon fishery by the rapids around 1455, &quot;Ænækoski laxefiskeri&quot;. At the time, it was not a proper settlement and was located in the hunting grounds of the people of Sysmä. The Rautalampi parish was established in 1561, at the time it was a large parish covering most of Central Finland north of the Päijänne. The Laukaa parish, including the area of Äänekoski, was separated from Rautalampi in 1628.

A settlement named Äänekoski has existed at least since 1752. It remained a part of Laukaa until the parish was established in 1907 and the municipality Äänekosken maalaiskunta was established in 1911. At the time, Äänekosken maalaiskunta was called simply &quot;Äänekoski&quot;. The municipality was divided in 1932: the actual settlement of Äänekoski became the &quot;kauppala&quot; of Äänekoski, Suolahti became another &quot;kauppala&quot; while the old Äänekoski municipality was renamed &quot;Äänekosken maalaiskunta&quot; and its administrative seat was moved to the village of Honkola. Äänekoski and Äänekosken maalaiskunta still shared a parish.

The first industrial enterprises appeared in 1896–1900.

Four municipalities have been consolidated with Äänekoski: Äänekosken maalaiskunta in 1969, Konginkangas in 1993 and Sumiainen and Suolahti in 2007. Äänekoski adopted the coat of arms of Suolahti in 2007.

==Geography==
Äänekoski is located along Finnish national road 4 approximately 40 km north of Jyväskylä. Finnish national road 69 to Suonenjoki begins in Hirvaskangas, 12 km south of Äänekoski center. Finnish national road 13 between Kokkola and Lappeenranta passes through Honkola, 6 km south of Äänekoski center. Äänekoski center is located between the Ääneselkä open water part of Lake Keitele and Lake Kuhnamo.

===Villages===
Modern Äänekoski is a product of a merger of multiple former municipalities, where the following villages were officially named:
* Konginkangas: Kalaniemi, Konginkangas center, Pyyrinlahti
* Sumiainen: Paadentaipale, Raikkaus, Sumiaisten kirkonkylä (Sumiainen church village)
* Suolahti: Suolahti center
* Äänekoski ja Äänekosken maalaiskunta (Rural Municipality of Äänekoski): Äänekoski center, Honkola, Kangashäkki (main part of which is in Uurainen), Kiimasjärvi, Koivisto (Koivistonkylä) and Petruma.

Besides these official divisions, the following villages or neighborhoods are also informally recognized: Hietama, Hirvaskangas, Laajaranta, Liimattala, Mämme, Parantala ja Rannankylä.

===Nature===
The area is heavily forested. It is also defined by the fractured Lake Keitele, which stretches generally in the southwest-northeast direction from Äänekoski center to the open waters of Keitele proper in Havusalmi, but which has multiple bays in the perpendicular, southeast-northwest direction. 

There are 13 Natura 2000 protected areas in Äänekoski. These include esker areas, waters rich in bird life and part of the Hitonhauta-Kylmähauta-Hirvasjoki ravine area, which extends from Äänekoski to Laukaa.

There are altogether 170 lakes in Äänekoski. The biggest lakes are Keitele, Kuhnamo and Niinivesi.

One of the world&#x27;s smallest rivers, the Kuokanjoki, is within the area. Aatunselkä is also located in this area.

==Demographics==
In 2021, there were 18,318 inhabitants, of which 75.8% lived in urban areas. There are three urban areas: Äänekoski center (12,899 inhabitants), Konginkangas (445) and Sumiaisten kirkonkylä (church village of Sumiainen, 406). Suolahden keskustaajama (the center of Suolahti), Kierälahti and Paatela used to categorized as a separate urban areas, but they are now counted as a part of Äänekoski center.

==Economy==
Äänekoski is a major industrial center. The largest corporate tax payer is Valtra, a manufacturer of tractors and agricultural machinery, which is a part of AGCO Corporation, followed by Kurikka Timber, a manufacturer of window components. Aura cheese is manufactured in the Valio&#x27;s Äänekoski dairy. The forest, pulp and paper industry is a major employer. In 1891, a groundwood pulp mill and a cardboard factory was founded in Äänekoski. Currently, sites in Äänekoski include a Metsä Board folding boxboard factory, Metsä Fibre kraft pulp and bioproduct mill, Metsä Wood plywood factory (former Finnforest) and a Nouryon plant (former CP Kelco), which manufactures chemical derivatives of cellulose.

<doc id="536858" wikidata="Q7008508" url="?curid=536858" title="New Haven Coliseum">
<text>New Haven Coliseum, formally known as New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum, was a sports and entertainment arena located in downtown New Haven, Connecticut. Construction began in 1968 and was completed in 1972. The Coliseum was officially closed on September 1, 2002, by Mayor John DeStefano Jr., and demolished by implosion on January 20, 2007.

The arena&#x27;s formal name was New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum, but most locals simply referred to it as &quot;New Haven Coliseum&quot;. The Coliseum held 11,497 people at full capacity, and occupied 4.5 acres (18,000 m2) of land next to the Knights of Columbus Building and faced the Oak Street Connector/Route 34 downtown spur.

==Hosted events==
The Coliseum hosted the New Haven Knights of the United Hockey League, New Haven Nighthawks, New Haven Senators, and Beast of New Haven of the American Hockey League, as well as the 1984 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and Yale University&#x27;s 2002 National Invitational Tournament men&#x27;s college basketball tournament opening round games. Also, it was home of the Connecticut Coasters roller hockey team in 1993, the Connecticut Pride of the IBL during the 2000–01 season, and the New Haven Ninjas af2 team in 2002. The UConn Huskies men&#x27;s basketball team played home games at the arena as their part-time home from 1978 to 1987. Ice Capades also performed at the Coliseum. New Haven Coliseum was also second home to Yale University Hockey, playing games sporadically at the Coliseum over the years. The U.S.A. Women&#x27;s Olympic Squad played an exhibition game vs. Sweden on December 15, 2001.

The Coliseum was also known for hosting many concerts during its existence, notable performers included Grateful Dead, Rush, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bee Gees, Queen, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, Jethro Tull, Pat Benatar, Judas Priest, Bon Jovi, KISS, Phish, and Guns N&#x27; Roses.

Most notably, in 1986, the Coliseum served as the setting for Van Halen&#x27;s multi-platinum concert film &quot;Live Without a Net&quot;. Many of the era&#x27;s most prominent musical stars also appeared at the Coliseum. It also was the home of the famous &quot;Eruption&quot; solo performed by Eddie Van Halen and his bandmates which took place on August 27, 1986.

The pilot episode of WWE SmackDown was filmed at the Coliseum on April 27, 1999, and aired on UPN two days later.

Tool was the final musical act on August 20, 2002.

The final event held at the Coliseum was a professional wrestling show held by World Wrestling Entertainment, one of the original attractions in the arena since 1972. The WWE considered the Coliseum its home arena, as it was—for much of its history—the closest venue to WWE&#x27;s headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. Most matches were broadcast, first on WTNH, as well as on local UHF stations.

==History==

===Construction===
The Coliseum was built to replace the New Haven Arena, New Haven&#x27;s prior indoor sports and entertainment venue. The Coliseum, as well as the neighboring Knights of Columbus building, was designed by the architect Kevin Roche of Roche-Dinkeloo. One interesting aspect of the arena&#x27;s design was that the parking garage was built on top of the actual Coliseum structure; this was necessitated by a high water table in the area which made it overly difficult to construct sub-surface parking facilities. Though an interesting solution, this design proved unpopular because of the quarter-mile helical ramps required to access the parking. Vincent Scully, the revered architectural historian at nearby Yale University, often referred to the design as &quot;Structural Exhibitionism&quot; in his modern architecture lectures. Other features of the design, such as street storefronts and an exhibition hall, were never completed.

===Deterioration and Closure===
During the 1980s, the structure of the parking garages had deteriorated to the point where large canvas panels had to be attached to the outside to catch pieces of concrete that would occasionally drop off onto the sidewalk below. Renovations were made to correct that problem. The city shut down the facility in 2002 after concluding that it was a drain on city coffers. However, the city did not hold any public hearings, referendum votes, or conduct any surveys, and several groups, local stakeholders, and the Coalition to Save Our Coliseum mounted a campaign to save and renovate the Coliseum, to no avail. Others in the community supported the plan to demolish the arena. Despite Mayor DeStefano&#x27;s plan to close and demolish the building within six months, it ultimately took more than four years.

Among the reasons for the Coliseum&#x27;s demise was the construction or renovation (often with state money) in the 1990s of alternative comparably sized venues within the southern Connecticut market. The Arena at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport attracted a minor league hockey team, the Bridgeport Sound Tigers. The Mohegan Sun Arena was built about an hour away, and became the home of the Connecticut Sun. Many musical acts started booking the Oakdale Theatre in the city of Wallingford, Connecticut, after it was upgraded and expanded. Even though the state gave $5.5 million to the arena for new paint, signage, and scoreboards, the Coliseum simply could not compete with newer facilities. Even as early as 1980 the Coliseum was decried as a &quot;white elephant&quot;. Mayor DeStefano also had staked out a strategy of investing city resources into arts and cultural activities rather than attracting sports teams to the city.

===Demolition===

Actual demolition work began in late October 2005 with removal of most of the arena area. At 7:50 a.m. on January 20, 2007, after years of wrangling and delay, the Coliseum was finally imploded, using more than 2,000 pounds of explosive. It was said that the implosion could be heard all the way to Meriden and Northford. As it came down, a massive cloud of dust and smoke covered the surrounding area, but blew away quickly toward the shoreline. Upwards of 20,000 people watched from the nearby Temple Street Garage and other buildings, and residents of nearby apartments were evacuated. The two helical ramps were not imploded, and were subsequently destroyed by conventional methods.

The city has tentative plans to replace the Coliseum with a new downtown/Long Wharf redevelopment plan, including a relocated Long Wharf Theatre and a new campus for Gateway Community College.

A temporary 400-space parking lot opened on the former Coliseum site on December 4, 2007, but plans are advancing to redevelop the site with a hotel, hundreds of housing units and approximately of commercial space. The master developer, LiveWorkLearnPlay had the project approved in 2013, but construction has been delayed due to cost issues related to the moving of utilities and conflicts related to planned highway improvements.

On January 12, 2009, the Knights of Columbus filed a lawsuit against the City of New Haven, Stamford Wrecking Company and Demolition Dynamics Company. The lawsuit seeks repayment for damages incurred to the Knights of Columbus Building and Knights of Columbus Museum across the street from the Coliseum.

=== After demolition ===

A poster archiving all concerts held at the Coliseum was installed on the parking lot, on March 4, 2021. It was a commemoration of the Coliseum and rock &#x27;n roll culture.

<doc id="536862" wikidata="Q1739004" url="?curid=536862" title="Kenny vs. Spenny">
<text>Kenny vs. Spenny is a Canadian reality comedy television series starring Kenny Hotz and Spencer Rice where they face against each other in competitions. The loser of each episode performs an act of humiliation, usually selected by the winner. Hotz and Rice created the series in addition to serving as executive producers, and it was typically shot in their hometown of Toronto (the pilot was filmed in Los Angeles), based mostly out of the house they shared. As of November 2008, the show aired on CBC, Global and Showcase in Canada, Comedy Central in Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands, The Comedy Channel in Australia, Animax and later, Sony MAX, in South Africa, Italia 2 in Italy, FX in Portugal, and on Jim in Finland. The series concluded with an hour-long Christmas special that aired on December 23, 2010, at 9 pm ET/PT on Showcase. It aired in Latin America on Sony Spin for a short time.

The series was nominated for the Canadian Comedy Awards in 2010 and 2011 and for Gemini Awards in 2005, 2006, and 2008 as the best Canadian comedy series, and received a Rose d&#x27;Or nomination in Switzerland for &quot;best international comedy series&quot;. The show has spawned several replicas of its format, including a family-friendly French Canadian version called &quot;Frank vs Girard&quot; that airs on VRAK.TV. Also following the format are &quot;Ed vs. Spencer&quot; in the United Kingdom, &quot;Juan vs. Roman&quot; in Colombia, &quot;Elton vs. Simon&quot; in Germany, &quot;Katja vs. Bridget&quot;, &quot;Dennis vs. Valerio&quot; in the Netherlands, and &quot;Sid vs. Varun&quot; in India. In 2009 the show was named #8 among the top 10 Canadian television shows of the decade.

==Premise==

Kenneth &quot;Kenny&quot; Joel Hotz and Spencer &quot;Spenny&quot; Nolan Rice are two childhood best friends who compete against each other in a series of competitions. The loser of each competition must suffer a humiliation chosen by the winner.

The show&#x27;s comedy depended on the polarizing personalities of Hotz and Rice, who are respectively extroverted and neurotic. Hotz embraced devious tactics during the show and often cheated, found loopholes in the rules for a competition, and intimidated Rice with insults, elaborate schemes and manipulation.

In contrast, Rice rarely cheated and tried to compete honestly. He felt he could retain some dignity if he promoted awareness of social or political causes, such as promoting awareness of climate change during &quot;Who Can 69 The Longest?&quot; or Irritable bowel syndrome during &quot;Who Can Keep a Dump in their Pants the Longest?&quot;

However, Hotz&#x27;s strategies and jokes made Rice increasingly paranoid and short-tempered towards Hotz and the production crew as the show progressed.

=== Common strategies used by Hotz and Rice ===

==== Rules ====
A repeating trend as the show progresses is how cheating is tolerated as long as the person is not caught, eventually becoming an unspoken rule, much to the chagrin of Spenny.

Part of the drama involves the multiple instances in which Kenny and Spenny argue about what the nature of the show should actually be. Spenny has argued that the point of the competitions is to find out who is the better man, and that while Kenny at times manages to genuinely outsmart Spenny, the moments in which he goes over the line ruins the purpose of the show. On the other hand Kenny holds less value in the “sanctity” of these competitions, repeatedly stating that the reason they compete is to humiliate the other person on TV.

Ultimately it becomes clear that their perspectives on what the nature of the show should be is motivated by creating a playing field that is biased towards their respective strengths.

Kenny’s approach to problem solving is to think outside of the box and to find a clever workaround, thus causing him to prefer rules that are minimal and vague. Spenny on the other hand prefers rules that are concrete, and tends to employ admirable if reductive strategies that rely on hard work as well as physical/mental endurance. 

==== Cheating ====
Hotz cheated during 27 out of 56 of his victories, while Rice cheated during five of his 27 victories. In some cases, both Rice and Hotz were helped by their production crew, families and friends in their attempts to cheat. While Rice would cheat out of desperation, Hotz justified his cheating by arguing the loser is ultimately whoever does a humiliation.

==== Insults ====
Hotz regularly tried to make Rice annoyed during competitions so he would lose focus. Hotz regularly joked that Rice was a violent and emotionally disturbed man with a micropenis; that he engaged in rape, pedophilia, necrophilia, zoophilia, and incest; and that he was racist, an anti-Semite and related to Adolf Hitler.

Rice&#x27;s family were also often the victims of Hotz&#x27;s insults and jokes. Hotz regularly joked about having sex with Rice&#x27;s mother and accused her of being sexually promiscuous and morbidly obese. In &quot;Who Can Imitate the Other Guy Better?&quot; Hotz—while pretending to be Rice—performed a song about being sexually abused as a child by Rice&#x27;s grandfather.

==== Deception and intimidation ====
Hotz&#x27;s main tactic was to deceive Rice and make him become angry or upset. In &quot;Who Is Funnier?&quot; Hotz drafted a letter from Ontario&#x27;s health ministry that Rice had recently had sexual intercourse with someone who had tested positive for HIV/AIDS. Rice was too upset to complete his stand-up comedy routine at a Toronto Yuk Yuk&#x27;s. Hotz used the prank as his entry. Rice was poisoned with Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) during “Who Can Wear A Dead Octopus On Their Head The Longest?”

Hotz sometimes invented comedic characters and dressed in costumes to entertain the viewers and crew while antagonizing Rice. As an example, Hotz harassed Rice as &quot;Silencio,&quot; and wore a white jumpsuit and Lucha libre-style mask in &quot;Who Can Stay Blindfolded The Longest?&quot;

Rice often lost competitions because his paranoia made him sabotage his own efforts. In &quot;Who Can Kiss More Women?&quot; Rice believed Hotz was spying on him after a woman who recognized Rice from the show started helping him. Hotz said he did not know who the woman was. During &quot;Who Can Blow the Biggest Fart?&quot; Hotz made a chili filled with an antiflatulent. Hotz blew air into his anus with a plastic tube and farted in front of Rice to make it appear like he had bigger farts. Rice ate some of the chilli and was unable to fart for the rest of the competition.

==== Use of family and friends ====
Hotz often recruited his family to help with his campaigns against Rice. His mother, Tzafi, was in 18 episodes and frequently helped her son. In &quot;Who Can Win a Ten Mile Race?&quot; Tzafi agreed to pretend to have died during filming of the episode after pretending to be sick. Hotz gave Rice a fake funeral time in the hopes Rice would not have enough time to win.

In &quot;Who Can Dance the Longest?&quot; Tzafi let Hotz hide in her home as Rice searched the house for him. In the same episode, his sister demanded payment from Rice in exchange for any information on Hotz&#x27;s whereabouts and Hotz&#x27;s brother refused to help.

Rice&#x27;s family also appeared in the show. In &quot;First One to Talk Loses,&quot; Hotz invited Rice&#x27;s cousin to the house where they filmed for a date. Hotz hoped Rice would speak out in anger, but instead heard Hotz asking her &quot;please?&quot; when he tried kissing her. She returned to help Rice in &quot;First Guy to Get a Boner Loses&quot; and performed a striptease for Hotz. This failed because Hotz had asked his brother—who is a physician in Toronto—for a nerve block to temporarily stop erections.

In &quot;Who Can Get Further With The Other Guy&#x27;s Mom?&quot; Rice took his robe off in front of Tzafi after he attempted to kiss her. Hotz got Rice&#x27;s mother drunk and said he &quot;could not legally say what happened,&quot; but smelled his finger and made a disgusted face to suggest he touched her genitals.

Friends and mutual friends were often used by both Rice and Hotz to help with plans or unnerve their opponent. Hotz regularly met with Hwang Goldfield, a practitioner of alternative medicine in Toronto’s Koreatown neighbourhood, for supplements and advice. The two had a falling out after Hotz tampered with products in the store and joked that Goldfield planned the September 11 attacks.

==== Involvement of the production crew ====
Both Hotz and Rice had their production crews get props and equipment, and get involved with strategies. Rice has admitted in interviews following the show’s end he agreed to let Hotz and the crew conspire against him in exchange for deciding each competitions rules.

Soundman Brendan Michie and unit co-ordinator Jamie Tiernay were frequent production crew members who helped Hotz. Michie used his skills as a pianist, guitarist and saxophone player to compose songs for Hotz. Tiernay was often an active participant in Hotz’s plans. In &quot;Who Can Wear a Gorilla Suit the Longest?&quot; Tiernay and Tzafi wore gorilla costumes to confuse Rice.

Rice regularly relied on his unit co-ordinator, Donny Rose, to help brainstorm strategies, stop Hotz from cheating, or foil Hotz&#x27;s attempts to make Rice lose. Hotz fired Rose after two seasons because he felt he was giving too much help to Rice. During &quot;First One to Talk Loses,&quot; Hotz reprimanded Rose for helping Rice become unglued from a dresser.

Rice also had production assistant Brian Peco and unit co-ordinator Kevin Morgan help with his plans and offer feedback. In &quot;Who Can Make the Best Viral Video?&quot; Rice&#x27;s crew encouraged him to drink his own urine and post it online.

The crew were often used to disrupt competitions, act as judges and settle disputes over rules. During &quot;Who Can 69 The Longest?&quot; the crew got bored because Hotz and Rice had spent much of the start of the competition on a couch. The production crew and other people physically abused Hotz and Rice. The abuse ended when Rice quit after the two were sprayed with a fire hose from the Niagara Falls fire department.

In cases where both Rice and Hotz failed to win a competition, the crew chose a double humiliation for them. Both Hotz and Rice had to take a nude bath together following &quot;Who Can Smoke More Weed?&quot; and make out with each other after &quot;Who Can Survive in the Woods the Longest?&quot; They also joined humiliations. After &quot;Who Can Win a Cockfight?&quot; Hotz made Rice smoke a joint made from the crew&#x27;s body hair. The crew vomited on Rice after &quot;Who&#x27;s the Best Soldier?&quot;

==Production==

Starting with the fourth season, Kenny and Spenny were both executive producers and received credit separate from five other executive producers. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, creators of the TV show &quot;South Park&quot;, joined the show for the fourth season and were given their own separate credit as executive producers for the ten episodes in which they were involved. Instrumental and electronic music is frequently used throughout episodes scored by Composer Richard Pell. &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;, Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;, Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Montagues and Capulets&quot; and &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La gazza ladra&quot;, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 40 in G minor – 4th Movement&quot;, and music by Toronto electronica band Holy Fuck are very frequently used.

Kenny and Spenny each had their own production assistant, camera operator, and sound engineer, who filmed their independent exploits for each episode. In the earlier seasons, the crew was shared between Kenny and Spenny. Crew members eventually split up into two teams, some joining Kenny&#x27;s &quot;side&quot;, and others joining Spenny&#x27;s.

During the Industry Standard podcast, Kenny stated the series had a budget of 100,000 CAD per episode for the first season and 350,000 CAD per episode thereafter.

==Broadcasting==
During an interview with Strombo, Kenny states that &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot; was originally made for MTV, where the duo was given $8,000 to develop a 3 minute pilot. However, MTV ultimately passed on the show for unknown reasons. He then states USA Network gave them $40,000 to shoot a full 22 minute pilot, but pulled the plug while the pilot was still in production. Kenny and Spenny both decided to finish the pilot anyway and eventually brought it to CBC Television where the show would first air. Despite the claims made by Kenny, the DVD release of &quot;Pitch&quot; states that the pilot for &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot; was actually picked up by Canada&#x27;s Life Network where the show was to go into production in 2001. This ultimately never happened. CBC cancelled the show after the first season, and Showcase Television picked up the series in late 2005. The show has switched broadcasters and been cancelled many times, including by Showcase, and again by CBC, when one of its commercials aired by accident during the network&#x27;s &quot;toddler block&quot;. Spenny has stated in multiple interviews that the main reason for CBC&#x27;s cancelling of the show was because it aired right before CBC News, and news viewers tuning in early were offended by the show&#x27;s humiliation segment.

It was produced by Breakthrough Films and Television since its inception. Re-runs of the first two seasons air on CBC late at night, and on CBC&#x27;s Bold station weekday afternoons. Re-runs also aired on Showcase, and episodes of the show have aired on Shaw Media&#x27;s Action. The show has aired on GSN in the United States. It is shown internationally on TV 2 Zulu in Denmark, Jim in Finland, the now defunct ZTV Norway, Comedy Central in Sweden, FX (repeats on Challenge) in the United Kingdom (no longer airing), The Comedy Channel in Australia, FX in Portugal, Comedy Central in Germany, Italia 2 in Italy, Comedy Central in the Netherlands and The XtraHOT channel in Israel. Fox Entertainment Group in Latin America has distributed the episodes, which can be seen on the Latin American versions of FOX channel and FX.

==Episodes==
===Christmas special===
The series finale &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot; Christmas Special aired December 23, 2010, at 9 pm eastern time on Showcase.

===DVD releases===
Video Service Corp has released all six seasons of &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot; on DVD in Region 1 (Canada only). Beyond Home Entertainment has released the first three seasons on DVD in Region 4.

===Streaming availability===
Between November 7, 2012 and December 22, 2012, Hotz uploaded the series to his personal YouTube account. On January 22, 2016, Hotz took down the YouTube series (by setting the clips to private), as Rice objected to the episodes being available for free. Hotz stated in a tweet a few days later he was not happy with the removal.

In March 2018, all the videos were made available again on his channel. Following the 2020 protests over the murder of George Floyd, the two-part episode &quot;Who Do Black Guys Like Better?&quot; was privatized briefly by Hotz.

Hotz began re-uploading the series upscaled to 4K resolution in January 2022. These episodes were removed from the channel towards late March 2022, but re-uploaded later that summer. The episodes were also available on Breakthrough Entertainment&#x27;s YouTube account but removed in December 2022. In July 2024, Kenny’s channel got a community guidelines violation and he moved some episodes to an alternative channel, Kenny Hotz TV.

Season 1 of the show is available on CBC Gem.

==Statistics==
The records and winning percentages vary depending on the definition of a win used by each competitor. The interpretation of what constitutes cheating also varies depending on the competition and may lead to some discrepancies in the statistics.
* If competitions where Kenny cheated (16) or arguably cheated (3) and won are not counted, the record would be 40-21-5 for Kenny; If they are counted as wins for Spenny (as Spenny suggests they should), then Kenny and Spenny would be tied, each with a record of 40-40-5. Note though that Spenny cheated 8 times.

If the competition ends in a draw, there is either no humiliation, or a double humiliation. Although there have been exceptions to this rule.

== Other media ==
===Kenny vs. Spenny: Versusville===

After the show first aired on CBC, a game was released based on the first season called Kenny vs. Spenny: Versusville. &quot;Versusville&quot; is a first-person shooter with 3D environments and 4 main game modes. It was released sometime between June and July 2004 on Windows and had online leaderboards and online multiplayer functionality.

The game was considered lost media ever since 2006 when the television show &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot; moved from the CBC to Showcase. However, on November 4, 2021, &quot;Versusville&quot; was found by Reddit archivists Ben, Carson, John, and Metalock and has since been made available on https://versusville.com/ with permission from Kenny Hotz, Ira Levy and Mark Greenshields.

==== Gameplay ====
&quot;Kenny vs. Spenny: Versusville&quot; contains 4 main game modes, with each having a unique gameplay style and 3 of which having once supported online multiplayer. Each game can be played from a first-person or third-person perspective.

*Residence Evil: A singleplayer-exclusive stealth game mode that originally acted as a tutorial, requiring the player to complete it in order to unlock the other 3 game modes. The map is a rough recreation of the house from Season One, where the player must open the vault without getting caught by Kenny or Spenny. Eventually a v2 was released, which no longer required the player to beat Residence Evil in order to unlock the other game modes.
*Wasteball: A multiplayer shooter where players would compete in slime-filled matches. The map is described as a disused building that has been transformed into a chemical waste paintball arena.
*Grave Rave: A multiplayer shooter where players must throw zombie parts in order to dispatch each other. The map is described as a late night cemetery filled with a gruesome array of weapons.
*Kart Dart: A multiplayer racing game where players must complete a certain number of laps and end with the most points. The vehicles are a selection of different shopping carts, with 3 unique maps all based on food markets.

==== Awards ====
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | 2005
| &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny: Versusville&quot;
| Canadian New Media Award&#x27;s Excellence in Gaming
 Other appearances

A flash game was released in early 2004 called &quot;Kenny vs Spenny: Quest for the Family Jewels&quot; on GSN&#x27;s website.

Another flash game was released in 2008 called &quot;Kenny vs Spenny: Best Friends/Worst Enemies&quot;. However, this game was only a demo for a larger mobile game of the same name. The full game is currently considered lost media.

Kenny Hotz appears as a non-playable character in the 2014 video game Goat Simulator for Windows PC and the protagonist of the game is a playable goat named Pilgor who is modeled after Kenny&#x27;s goat from the season 4 episode &quot;Who Can Be Tied to a Goat the Longest?&quot; Kenny also makes an appearance in Journey to the Savage Planet through in-game commercials.

On January 2, 2023 Kenny Hotz posted a teaser of a new game to his Youtube channel, titled &quot;Super KvS&quot;. The game is designed by developer Dark Pixel Studios, with no specified release date.

==Revival attempts==

Both Hotz and Rice have expressed interest in a film adaptation of &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot;. In a 2013 interview, Rice elaborated, &quot;if it happens I don&#x27;t think I will live through it but it will be good entertainment.&quot; Later on March 7, 2014, Hotz began the Facebook and Twitter campaign #BringBackKvS in an effort to encourage Netflix to commission a seventh season of the show. Netflix had recently resurrected the &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; series from its 2008 finale, and it was Hotz&#x27;s intention to replicate this success. Between March and May 2014, Hotz and Rice embarked on a 13-city Kenny vs. Spenny vs. Canada comedy tour, showing and discussing rare and unseen &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot; footage that had been rejected by broadcasters. The tour was filmed for a Kickstarter-funded film titled &quot;Kenny vs Spenny: On The Road&quot;, however the campaign failed to meet its goal and the film was not released.

Hotz and Rice revisited their onscreen antics in the 2020 CBC Gem special &quot;Paldemic&quot;, which directly referenced &quot;Kenny vs. Spenny&quot; and its effect on their friendship and careers in the years since. They jointly received a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Best Host in a Web Program or Series at the 9th Canadian Screen Awards in 2021.

<text>East Rock of south-central Connecticut, United States, with a high point of , is a long trap rock ridge located primarily in the neighborhood of East Rock on the north side of the city of New Haven. A prominent landscape feature and a popular outdoor recreation area with cliffs that rise over the city below, East Rock is part of the narrow, linear Metacomet Ridge that extends from Long Island Sound near New Haven, north through the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts to the Vermont border. East Rock is the central feature of East Rock Park, a municipal park owned by the city of New Haven along the New Haven-Hamden town line.

==Geography==
East Rock, located in New Haven and Hamden, Connecticut, is long by wide at its widest point, although steepness of the terrain make the actual land area much larger. Beside the high point, East Rock has three other distinct peaks: Whitney Peak, , a sharp-sided pinnacle on the north side of the ridge; Indian Head, , just south of the high point; and Snake Rock, , the southern buttress of the ridge.

Whitney Peak and Lake Whitney (located at the western base of the mountain behind the dammed Mill River) are named after Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin and a former New Haven resident. The Eli Whitney Museum, a museum and workshop with hands-on projects and exhibits on Eli Whitney and A. C. Gilbert, is located at the base of the dam.
On the summit of East Rock, clearly visible for miles below, is the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. The monument honors the residents of New Haven who gave their lives in the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the Civil War.

East Rock is located entirely within the 425-acre (172 ha) East Rock Park, managed by the city of New Haven, which maintains a seasonal automobile road that climbs to the summit of the ridge, a network of trails, an environmental center, and a rose garden. A number of recreation facilities are located at the southwest base of the ridge; these are also managed by the city. The ridge is completely surrounded by the urban neighborhoods of New Haven and its metropolitan extension into south Hamden. East Rock lends its name to the nearby upscale East Rock neighborhood of New Haven, known for its Queen Anne and Victorian architecture. U.S. Route 5 borders the east side of East Rock while Interstate 91 crosses below Snake Rock to the south.

The Metacomet Ridge extends west from East Rock as series of smaller, unnoteworthy traprock outcrops to West Rock Ridge; it extends east over another series of traprock outcrops to Saltonstall Mountain and Peter&#x27;s Rock. The west side of East Rock drains into the Mill River thence to New Haven Harbor and Long Island Sound; the east side into the Quinnipiac River, thence to New Haven Harbor and Long Island Sound. Both rivers abut the base of the mountain.

==Geology==

East Rock is a fault-block ridge formed 200 million years ago during the Triassic and Jurassic periods and is composed of trap rock, known as basalt, if extrusive, or diabase, if intrusive. East Rock, being intrusive, is diabase. Diabase is a dark colored rock, but the iron within it weathers to a rusty brown when exposed to the air, lending the ledges a distinct reddish appearance. Diabase frequently breaks into octagonal and pentagonal columns, creating a unique &quot;postpile&quot; appearance. Huge slopes made of fractured diabase scree are visible beneath many of the ledges of East Rock. These diabase cliffs are the product of lava intrusions hundreds of feet deep that welled up through faults creating sills during the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia and Africa over a period of 20 million years. Erosion and glacial abrasion over the subsequent 200 million years wore away the weaker sedimentary layers, under which the sill had intruded, at a faster rate than the diabase, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the diabase sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today.

==Ecosystem==
East Rock hosts a combination of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak and a variety of understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Cooler north facing backslopes tend to support extensive stands of eastern hemlock interspersed with the oak-hickory forest species more common in the surrounding lowlands. Narrow ravines crowded with hemlock block sunlight, creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in eastern Connecticut.

East Rock is also an important seasonal raptor migration path.

==Recreation==
East Rock is a popular outdoor recreation destination among residents and visitors of the greater New Haven region. Views from the clifftops span metropolitan New Haven, Long Island Sound, and Long Island.

East Rock Park is open year-round to hikers and walkers. The automobile road is open April 1 to November 1, 8 a.m. to sunset and November 1 to March 31, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and holidays, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., weather permitting. Activities permitted in the park include hiking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, picnicking, bicycling (on roads and city-designated mountain bike trails only), boating (on the Mill River), bird watching, and dog walking. Rock climbing, swimming, and alcoholic beverages are prohibited. A number of hiking trails traverse the ridge, most notably the Giant Steps Trail which ascends to the summit at a near-vertical pitch from the south. At the foot of the mountain are located football, baseball, and soccer fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, and playgrounds. The Trowbridge Environmental Center is open Thursdays and Fridays from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm, and at least one Saturday a month for public programs; it offers displays and information about the geology and ecosystem of East Rock. The Pardee Rose Garden and Greenhouse features roses and other flowering plants from spring to fall, and is a popular place to shoot wedding pictures.

The naturalist landscaping and other aspects of the park led to its being listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.
