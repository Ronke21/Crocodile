<text>Paul Antony Young (born 17 January 1956) is an English musician, singer and songwriter. Formerly the frontman of the short-lived bands Kat Kool &amp; the Kool Cats, Streetband and Q-Tips, he became a teen idol with his solo success in the 1980s. His hit singles include &quot;Love of the Common People&quot;, &quot;Wherever I Lay My Hat&quot;, &quot;Come Back and Stay&quot;, &quot;Every Time You Go Away&quot; and &quot;Everything Must Change&quot;, all reaching the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart. Released in 1983, his debut album, &quot;No Parlez&quot;, was the first of three UK number-one albums.

Young&#x27;s smooth yet soulful voice belongs to a genre known as &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot;. He won a Brit Award for Best British Male in 1985, and his hit &quot;Every Time You Go Away&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and won Best British Video at the 1986 Brit Awards. Performing on the 1984 charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; which included singing the opening lines, Young played Live Aid held at Wembley Stadium, London in July 1985. He sang the Crowded House track &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot; at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute in 1988. In 1992, he sang &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; with the surviving members of Queen at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert. Since the mid-1990s, Young has performed with the band Los Pacaminos.

==Early life==
Paul Young was born in Luton, Bedfordshire, England. He has an older brother and a younger sister. As a youth, after school, he played football for the Vauxhall Motors factory where he worked. In his spare time, he played in several bands as a bass guitarist.

==Career==
The first group for which Young became lead singer was Kat Kool &amp; the Kool Kats. In the late 1970s, he joined Streetband, who had one top 20 hit in the UK, with the humorous, novelty track &quot;Toast&quot;. In December 1979, Streetband disbanded.

===Q-Tips===
The ex-Streetbanders added new recruits Dave Lathwell on guitar and Baz Watts on drums and became Q-Tips. In addition, a four piece brass section was created. Q-Tips&#x27;s first rehearsals took place in November 1979. Their first concert was on 18 November 1979 at the Queens Arms Hotel in Harrow. This gig was followed by another at the Horn of Plenty in St Albans. By 1 April 1980, the band had recorded two tracks, &quot;SYSLJFM (The Letter Song)&quot;, and &quot;Having a Party&quot;, both recorded at the Livingstone Studios in Barnet. Constant touring and concert appearances had built a strong fan base by mid-1981. The professionalism of the band had attracted the attention of several record labels, with the late Mickie Most (RAK Records) confirming on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;Round Table&quot; programme that Q-Tips &quot;...are easily the best live band working at the moment&quot;. In August 1980, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; reported that Q-Tips had released their debut, eponymous album.

Q-Tips appeared on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;In Concert&quot;, &quot;Rock Goes to College&quot; and &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in the latter part of 1981. Q-Tips also opened for the J. Geils Band, the Knack, Thin Lizzy, Bob Marley and the Average White Band. The band toured with After the Fire and supported the Who on their 12-date UK tour in 1980. In 1981, Q-Tips played the Montreux Jazz Festival.

With poor record sales after the release of two albums and seven singles, Q-Tips broke up in early 1982 when Young signed a solo recording contract with CBS. Young briefly teamed up again with Q-Tips for a reunion tour in 1993.

===Solo career and pop stardom===
Young was signed by Columbia Records as a solo performer. Together with ex-Q-Tips member Ian Kewley, Young began writing and recording songs for his debut album, the breakthrough &quot;No Parlez&quot;. Young&#x27;s new backing band, The Royal Family, included keyboardist Kewley, fretless bass player Pino Palladino, guitarist Steve Bolton, drummer Mark Pinder, and backing singers Maz Roberts and Kim Leslie a.k.a. The Fabulous Wealthy Tarts. His first single, &quot;Iron Out the Rough Spots&quot;, had no success, and neither the second one, a cover of &quot;Love of the Common People&quot;, while the song was a hit after a rerelease as a single later the same year, in the UK (and elsewhere), and the third, a cover of the Marvin Gaye song &quot;Wherever I Lay My Hat&quot;, reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in the summer of 1983. It was the first of Young&#x27;s 14 British Top 40 singles.

Similar success followed all over Europe. In the UK, follow-up single &quot;Come Back and Stay&quot; reached No. 4, and a re-release of &quot;Love of the Common People&quot; made it to No. 2 and even received radio airplay in the United States (thanks to its soundtrack inclusion in John Hughes&#x27;s film &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;), and his debut album &quot;No Parlez&quot; was certified platinum in various countries. In the UK, &quot;No Parlez&quot; spent five weeks at No. 1, and &quot;Wherever I Lay My Hat&quot; and &quot;Love of the Common People&quot; became the 14th and 15th best-selling singles of 1983.
The year 1984 was difficult for Young. His first heavy promotional and live concert tour of America strained his vocal cords to the extent that he was forced to rest his voice and did not sing for much of the year. He recovered sufficiently to become involved with the Band Aid single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, an all-star charity project put together by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure for Ethiopian famine relief. Young sang the opening lines of the song as a replacement for David Bowie.

Young returned to the UK Top Ten with a version of Ann Peebles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down&quot;. The latter appeared on his second album, &quot;The Secret of Association&quot;, released in 1985, which secured his future success in the United States, Japan and Australia. The album went to No. 1 in the UK. That year, Young scored the biggest worldwide hit of his career with &quot;Everytime You Go Away&quot;, a cover of a song from the 1980 Hall &amp; Oates album &quot;Voices&quot;. &quot;Everytime You Go Away&quot; was his biggest success in the U.S. At the 1985 Brit Awards, Young received the award for Best British Male. Associated with the Second British Invasion of the US, &quot;Everytime You Go Away&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1985. It also won Best British Video at the 1986 Brit Awards.

In July 1985, Young appeared at Live Aid at Wembley Stadium, London, performing his own hits &quot;Come Back and Stay&quot; and &quot;Everytime You Go Away&quot;. Alison Moyet joined him on stage to perform &quot;That&#x27;s The Way Love Is&quot;. He also joined the other artists at the end of the concert for the performance of Band Aid&#x27;s &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;.

During parts of 1987, Young toured extensively as the opening act for Genesis on their Invisible Touch Tour. Young played more than 35 dates in 13 countries. The tour concluded from 1–4 July 1987 with four sold-out shows playing to more than 350,000 fans at Wembley Stadium in London.

In 1990, he released a cover of The Chi-Lites&#x27; &quot;Oh Girl&quot;, which peaked at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Young sang the Crowded House track &quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot; at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute in 1988, producing a popular duet, &quot;Senza una donna (Without a Woman),&quot; with Italian blues singer Zucchero in 1991, and singing &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; with the surviving members of Queen in 1992, at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert soon after Freddie Mercury died. In 1991, he recorded a duet with Irish group Clannad for the Blake Edwards film &quot;Switch&quot;, a cover of the Joni Mitchell song, &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Dream It&#x27;s Over&quot;, &quot;Senza una donna (Without a Woman)&quot; and &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; were featured on Young&#x27;s first greatest hits album, &quot;From Time To Time – The Singles Collection&quot; (1991).

In 1993, Young was dropped from his contract with the CBS/Sony Records label. He contributed to the Vangelis album &quot;Voices&quot; in 1995. Young sang the British national anthem, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, at Wembley Stadium before England&#x27;s Euro &#x27;96 semi-final match against Germany.

Young&#x27;s next album, &quot;Paul Young&quot;, was released in 1997 on East West Records. In November 2001, when Young was on the final night of the Here and Now tour, Michael Aspel awarded him his &quot;This is Your Life&quot; book. In 2006, he released &quot;Rock Swings – On the Wild Side of Swing&quot;.

In 2010, Young recorded and released a new track &quot;Come Back&quot;, a duet he did with electronic dance music act Chicane. The single was a sample of Young&#x27;s 1983 hit &quot;Come Back and Stay&quot;, and charted at 151 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was recorded onto Chicane&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Giants&quot;. After a lengthy absence of recorded material, Young released an album of vintage soul songs in 2016 called &quot;Good Thing&quot; and began a lengthy period of tours and festival appearances.

===Los Pacaminos===

Young first formed Los Pacaminos in 1993. The reason for the group forming was Young&#x27;s desire to get back to basics. He said: &quot;I was between record labels and writing material for a new album but I wanted to play live again. I&#x27;ve always loved the Tex-Mex sound and knew a few musicians who had a similar passion for this type of music. So I asked them to join me in forming a band.&quot;

The group&#x27;s early performances were in bars and clubs, performing a mixture of their own material and covers. The album &quot;Los Pacaminos&quot; was released in 2002.

The band performed and recorded throughout Europe and the UK. In 2014, the band released their second album, &quot;A Fistful of Statins&quot;. Other media released by the band include an EP and a live album.

===Collaborations===
Young&#x27;s earliest collaboration was in the late 1970s on Streetband&#x27;s first album &quot;London&quot;, when Ian Dury made a guest appearance on the track &quot;Mystery&quot;. In between the Q-Tips and the launch of his solo career, Young sang backing vocals on the Squeeze single &quot;Black Coffee in Bed&quot; with Elvis Costello. Young&#x27;s best-known musical collaboration (apart from Los Pacaminos) was his early collaboration with bassist Pino Palladino. Palladino, who had collaborated with Tears for Fears, Go West and Gary Numan, featured on four of Young&#x27;s albums: &quot;No Parlez&quot;, &quot;The Secret of Association&quot;, &quot;The Crossing&quot; and &quot;Paul Young&quot;. Palladino was the bass player in Young&#x27;s backing band The Royal Family and played at Live Aid.

Young released a version of the song &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot; with Irish group Clannad for the 1991 motion picture &quot;Switch&quot;.

==Personal life==
Young met his wife, former model Stacey Smith, on his video for &quot;Come Back and Stay&quot; in 1983. They married while they were living in Los Angeles in November 1987. They have two daughters and a son. Young and Smith split up in May 2006 and then reconciled in March 2009. During the separation, Smith had a son, Jude, with businessman Ilan Slazenger. On 26 January 2018, it was announced that Stacey Young had died of brain cancer, aged 52.

Young is a close friend of former Spandau Ballet lead singer Tony Hadley. The two toured Australia and New Zealand during October and November 2008.

<doc id="537147" wikidata="Q17083148" url="?curid=537147" title="Central nervous system cavernous hemangioma">
<text>Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a cavernous hemangioma that arises in the central nervous system. It can be considered to be a variant of hemangioma, and is characterized by grossly large dilated blood vessels and large vascular channels, less well circumscribed, and more involved with deep structures, with a single layer of endothelium and an absence of neuronal tissue within the lesions. These thinly walled vessels resemble sinusoidal cavities filled with stagnant blood. Blood vessels in patients with cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) can range from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. Most lesions occur in the brain, but any organ may be involved.

==Symptoms and signs==
Clinical symptoms of central nervous system origin include recurrent headaches, focal neurological deficits, hemorrhagic stroke, and seizures, but CCM can also be asymptomatic. The nature and severity of the symptoms depend on the lesion&#x27;s location.

===CCMs and venous angiomas===

In up to 30% there is a coincidence of CCM with a venous angioma, also known as a developmental venous anomaly. These lesions appear either as enhancing linear blood vessels or caput medusae, a radial orientation of small vessels that resemble the hair of Medusa from Greek mythology. These lesions are thought to represent developmental anomalies of normal venous drainage. These lesions should not be removed, as venous infarcts have been reported. When found in association with a CCM that needs resection, great care should be taken not to disrupt the angioma.

==Genetics==
Familial forms of CCM occur at three known genetic loci. The gene for CCM1 encodes &quot;KRIT1&quot; (krev interaction trapped 1), and has been found to bind to ICAP1alpha (integrin cytoplasmic domain associated protein alpha), a beta1 integrin associated protein. A particular mutation in CCM1 (the Q455X mutation), accounts for a cluster of cases in the Southwestern United States. This cluster, particularly in northern New Mexico, is an example of the founder effect; it has been traced back to early Spanish settlers.

The gene for CCM2 encodes a protein named malcavernin that contains a phosphotyrosine binding domain. The exact biological function of CCM2 is not clear. Recently, it has been shown that CCM1 and CCM2 proteins as well as ICAP1alpha form a macromolecular complex in the cell. In addition, it appears that CCM2 protein may function as a scaffolding protein for MAP kinases that are essential in p38 activation responding to osmotic stress including MEKK3 and MKK3. It also binds to Rac and actin. Therefore, CCM2 protein is also called OSM (osmosensing scaffold for MEKK3).

The CCM3 gene is the most recently identified CCM gene . CCM3 is known as PDCD10 (programmed cell death 10), which was initially identified as a gene that is up-regulated during the induction of apoptosis (cell death) in TF-1, a human myeloid cell line. The precise role of the PDCD10 protein in the CCM pathway is not clear. It is recently shown that PDCD10 forms a complex with CCM1 protein (KRIT1) and CCM2 protein (OSM). PDCD10 interacts directly with OSM independent of KRIT1-OSM interaction. Research is ongoing to determine the function and properties of all three CCM gene products as well as the reaction pathways in which they are involved.

Evidence suggests that a fourth gene, CCM4, may also cause CCM. Mutations in these genes account for 70 to 80 percent of all cases of cerebral cavernous malformations. The remaining 20 to 30 percent of cases may be due to other, still unidentified, genes. Recently it has been shown that the deletion of CDC42 in endothelial cells elicits cerebral vascular malformations, suggesting that it may be a fourth gene involved in CCM pathology. 

Recently, gain of function mjutations in Pik3ca has been reported in both sporadic and familial CCM, suggesting that like cancer, CCM lesions need to inhibit tumor suppressor genes and activate oncogenes.

==Mechanisms==
Many molecular mechanisms have been identified in CCM pathology. In 2015 it was reported that the endothelial cells forming cerebral vascular malformations undergo an endothelial to mesenchymal transition in both sporadic and familial CCM

CCM mutant endothelial cells have been reported to undergo clonal expansion and be able to recruit non-mutant cells into the lesions Recently, immunothrombosis and hypoxia have also been reported to be dysregulated in CCM. 

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is generally made by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly using a specific imaging technique known as a gradient-echo sequence MRI, which can unmask small or punctate lesions that may otherwise remain undetected. These lesions are also more conspicuous on FLAIR imaging compared to standard T2 weighing. FLAIR imaging is different from gradient sequences. Rather, it is similar to T2 weighing but suppresses free-flowing fluid signal. Sometimes quiescent CCMs can be revealed as incidental findings during MRI exams ordered for other reasons. Many cavernous hemangiomas are detected &quot;accidentally&quot; during MRIs searching for other pathologies. These &quot;incidentalomas&quot; are generally asymptomatic. In the case of hemorrhage, however, a CT scan is more efficient at showing new blood than an MRI, and when brain hemorrhage is suspected, a CT scan may be ordered first, followed by an MRI to confirm the type of lesion that has bled. Sometimes the lesion appearance imaged by MRI remains inconclusive. Consequently, neurosurgeons will order a cerebral angiogram or magnetic resonance angiogram. Since CCMs are low flow lesions (they are hooked into the venous side of the circulatory system), they will be angiographically occult (invisible). If a lesion is discernible via angiogram in the same location as in the MRI, then an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) becomes the primary concern.

==Treatment==
Treatment of symptomatic CCM is only via surgery, depending on the location of the lesions. There are no pharmaceuticals currently available to treat CCM.

==Incidence==
The incidence in the general population is roughly 0.5%, and clinical symptoms typically appear between 20 and 30 years of age. Once thought to be strictly congenital, these vascular lesions have been found to occur &quot;de novo&quot;. It may appear either sporadically or exhibit autosomal dominant inheritance.

<text>Arts Centre Melbourne, originally known as the Victorian Arts Centre and briefly called the Arts Centre, is a performing arts centre consisting of a complex of theatres and concert halls in the Melbourne Arts Precinct, located in the central Melbourne suburb of Southbank in Victoria, Australia.

It was designed by architect Sir Roy Grounds, the masterplan for the complex (along with the National Gallery of Victoria) was approved in 1960 and construction began in 1973 following some delays. The complex opened in stages, with Hamer Hall opening in 1982 and the Theatres Building opening in 1984.

Arts Centre Melbourne is located by the Yarra River and along St Kilda Road, one of the city&#x27;s main thoroughfares, and extends into the Melbourne Arts Precinct.

Major companies regularly performing include Opera Australia, The Australian Ballet, the Melbourne Theatre Company, The Production Company, Victorian Opera, Bell Shakespeare, Bangarra Dance Theatre and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Arts Centre Melbourne also hosts many Australian and international performances and production companies.

Arts Centre Melbourne is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.
==History==
===Background===
Arts Centre Melbourne&#x27;s site has long been associated with arts and entertainment; in the early 20th century it was occupied variously by a permanent circus venue, an amusement park, a cinema and a dance hall. The area was a popular venue featuring the Olympia Dancing Place, the Glaciarium Ice-Skating Rink, a Japanese tea house, Snowden Gardens, the Trocadero and the Princes Court with a miniature train and water-chute. The Wirth&#x27;s Circus appeared in 1907 with a 5000-seat auditorium.

In the book &quot;A Place Across the River&quot;, Vicki Fairfax described the lot as a &quot;oddly shaped piece of land&quot; considered a sacred public spot by the locals.

During World War II there was a push to establish a new home for the National Gallery of Victoria, along with a state theatre, on the site. The construction was difficult due to the triangular parcel of land the construction was planned on. However, by the 1960s, all the entertainment had left and the lot had turned into an improvised parking for city workers.

===Plans and construction (1960s–1970s)===
After many years of discussion, Roy Grounds was chosen as the architect, and his master plan of a gallery and an adjacent theatre under a tall copper spire was approved in 1960. One of the main challenge of the construction was to dry up and retain the waters out of the base, as the construction went as deep as below water levels. The original spire envisaged by Grounds was tall, and because of its complexity was one of the first structures in Australia to rely on computer-aided-design (CAD).

The gallery was completed in 1968, with the theatres to be built in a second stage.

Responsibility for the project lay with the building committee, established in 1956 and chaired by Kenneth Myer from 1965 to 1989. For twenty-five years the committee was a consistent force in the completion of the complex. Actor and film director George Fairfax, having joined the project in 1972, was appointed the first general manager of the building committee and then the trust, a position he held until 1989. As a result, Fairfax played an influential role in administration of Arts Centre Melbourne&#x27;s development.

In the early 1970s, due to the expansion of the size of both the theatre and the concert hall required, the addition of a smaller second theatre, and to accommodate difficulties associated with the geology of the site, Roy Grounds completely redesigned the project. The concert hall was separated out and placed in the riverbank, and the theatres building expanded above ground, with a latticework spire above.

Work began on the theatre site in 1973, but excavations were not completed until 1978, two years later than expected. Work began on the concert hall site in 1976. During the first phase of the project from 1972 until 1979 responsibility was with Rupert Hamer as Minister for the Arts (and premier) and during the main construction phase from 1979 to 1982 with Norman Lacy as Minister for the Arts (and Minister of Educational Services). After significant public controversy, political inquiry and financial reassessment, the spire was completed by the Minister for the Arts, Norman Lacy, installing the lightning conductor rod at its pinnacle on 20 October 1981. 

Once the buildings were nearly complete, and with the death of Grounds in 1981, Academy Award-winning expatriate set designer John Truscott, was employed to decorate the interiors. His work was constrained only by a requirement to leave elements already constructed, such as Ground&#x27;s faceted cave-like concert hall interior, to which he applied mineral finishes, and his steel mesh draped ceiling in the State Theatre, to which he added perforated brass balls.

During his tenure, Arts Minister Norman Lacy was constantly called on to defend the Victorian Arts Centre Trust and its construction program during some highly charged public debates in the parliament. He had to defend the acoustics, the design of the spire, the rejection of the proposed changes to the Concert Hall interiors, the BASS ticketing system of the project, as well as its delays and cost over runs.

The Victorian Arts Centre&#x27;s management and administration was set up under the &quot;Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979&quot; introduced into the Victorian parliament by Minister for the Arts, Norman Lacy. The trustees were appointed by the Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the minister. The trust were given responsibility for the operation and programming of the publicly owned performing arts spaces that make up the Victorian Arts Centre – the Theatres Building beneath the Spire, Hamer Hall and the Sidney Myer Music Bowl.

===Redevelopment (1981)===
Soon after the legislation to establish the trust was passed, Norman Lacy and George Fairfax undertook a study trip to North America and Europe to assess administrative arrangements, educational programs and community initiatives at major performing arts centres in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington, Toronto, Ottawa, London and Paris. The result was the development of Arts Centre Melbourne&#x27;s management structure during 1981 and a suite of opening and on-going initiatives.

The Concert Hall opened in November 1982, while substantial work remained to be done on the Theatres site. The rest of Arts Centre Melbourne was opened progressively in 1984, with the Theatres building officially opened in October that year. This signified the completion of one of the largest public works projects in Victorian history, which had been undertaken over a period of almost twenty-five years.

Arts Centre Melbourne is unusual in that its theatres and concert hall are built largely underground. Hamer Hall, situated closest to the river, was initially planned to be almost entirely underground, thus providing a huge open vista between the theatre spire, the river and Flinders Street railway station. However, construction problems with the foundations, including water seepage, meant the structure had to be raised to three storeys above ground. 

Similarly, budget constraints meant that Grounds&#x27; design for the Theatres Building, which included a copper-clad spire, were shelved, and a shortened un-clad design was substituted. This was eventually replaced with the current &quot;full-height&quot; un-clad spire.

By the mid-1990s, signs of deterioration became apparent on the upper spire structure and Arts Centre Melbourne&#x27;s Trust decided to replace the spire. The new spire was completed in 1996, and reaches , though still based on Grounds&#x27; original design. The spire is illuminated with some of optic fibre tubing, of neon tubing on the mast and 14,000 incandescent lamps on the spire&#x27;s skirt. The metal webbing of the spire was inspired by the billowing of a ballerina&#x27;s tutu and the Eiffel Tower.

===2000s===
In early 2008, a wedge-tailed eagle and peregrine falcon were utilised to deter groups of sulphur-crested cockatoos from damaging the spire&#x27;s electrical fittings and thimble-sized lights.

On 1 January 2012 the spire was accidentally set afire by New Year&#x27;s Eve fireworks. Two sides of the structure were set ablaze by fireworks that apparently discharged improperly, causing flaming debris to fall to the ground. The fire burned for about forty minutes, causing only cosmetic damage to the tower.

In February 2016, two protesters climbed the spire of the centre to protest Nauru detention centre deportations. They stayed on top of the spire for 11 hours, and disrupted a programmed light show. They unfurled a banner reading &quot;#letthemstay&quot;. They were not arrested.

 there are plans for a major upgrade of the theatre, as part of the $1.7 billion Melbourne Arts Precinct Transformation project.

==Building and venues==

Arts Centre Melbourne features a large steel spire with a wrap-around base. It is a complex of distinct venues. Hamer Hall is a separate building and the largest of the venues. The other venues (the State Theatre, Playhouse, Fairfax Studio and The Show Room) are housed in the Theatres Building (under the spire).

Hamer Hall Hamer Hall (formerly the Melbourne Concert Hall) is a 2,466-seat concert hall – the largest venue in Arts Centre Melbourne&#x27;s complex, used for orchestra and contemporary music performances. It was opened in 1982 and was later renamed Hamer Hall in honour of Sir Rupert Hamer (the 39th Premier of Victoria) shortly after his death in 2004.

State Theatre The State Theatre is located in the Theatres Building of Arts Centre Melbourne under the spire, and is a 2,079-seat theatre used for opera, ballet and theatre performances. It was opened in 1984, and has one of the largest stages in the World.

Playhouse The Playhouse is also located in the Theatres Building of Arts Centre Melbourne and is an 884-seat theatre used for plays and dance performances. It was also opened in 1984. The premiere production was the Melbourne Theatre Company&#x27;s staging of Euripides&#x27; &quot;Medea&quot;, starring Zoe Caldwell and Patricia Kennedy.

Fairfax Studio The Fairfax Studio is also located in the Theatres Building of Arts Centre Melbourne and is a 376-seat theatre. It was also opened in 1984.

The Show Room The Show Room is located between the Playhouse and Fairfax Studio within the Theatres Building and is an intimate 150-seat studio theatre. It was opened in 2024.

Galleries Arts Centre Melbourne also houses dedicated gallery spaces including newly opened Australian Music Vault (formally Gallery 1 and the George Adams Gallery) on Level 6 (Ground level), Gallery 2 on Level 7, the St Kilda Road Foyer Gallery and the Smorgon Family Plaza, whose walls and central areas are used for exhibitions, in the Theatres Building.

<doc id="537153" wikidata="Q874262" url="?curid=537153" title="Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal">
<text>Ladysmith (renamed uMnambithi in 2024) is a town in the Uthukela District of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It lies north-west of Durban and south-east of Johannesburg. Important industries in the area include food processing, textiles, and tyre production. Ladysmith is the seat for both the Alfred Duma Local Municipality and Uthukela District Municipality.

The town was named after Juana María de los Dolores de León Smith, also known as &quot;Lady Smith,&quot; the Spanish wife of Sir Harry Smith, the Governor of the Cape Colony from 1847–1852. It held strategic importance during the Second Boer War when, after numerous small skirmishes, it was besieged by Boer forces on 2 November 1899. After three British attempts to relieve the defenders and one Boer attempt to take the town all failed, the siege was eventually broken on 28 February 1900. Both Winston Churchill and Mahatma Gandhi were present at the siege, the former as a war correspondent and the latter as a stretcher-bearer.

In 1900, the unincorporated town of Oyster Harbour on the east coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, was renamed Ladysmith by James Dunsmuir in honour of the lifting of the siege of Ladysmith.
In 2023, it was proposed for Ladysmith to be renamed to uMnambithi. The name change officially took place in March 2024.

== History ==
In 1847, after buying land from the Zulu king Mpande, a number of Boers settled in the area and called it the Republic of Klip River with Andries Spies as their commandant. The republic was annexed by the British in the same year and on 20 June 1850 was proclaimed a township called Windsor. On 11 October 1850, the name was changed to Ladysmith after Juana María de los Dolores de León Smith, also known as &quot;Lady Smith,&quot; the Spanish wife of Sir Harry Smith, the Governor of the Cape Colony and high commissioner in South Africa from 1847 to 1852. A fort was built in 1860 to protect the villagers from the Zulu.

=== The Second Boer War ===

During the Second Boer War, British Lieutenant-General Sir George White made Ladysmith his centre of operations for the protection of Natal against Boer forces. Starting on 29 October 1899, a number of short-lived battles were fought for control of the town, but after suffering heavy casualties British forces retreated to Ladysmith, though the Boers did not make use of this opportunity to follow up their successes and take control of the town. Following the battles, while British forces under White regrouped in the town, the Boers surrounded Ladysmith. The siege of Ladysmith lasted 118 days, from 2 November 1899 to 28 February 1900, during the most crucial stage of the war.

Three attempts by General Sir Redvers Buller to break the siege resulted in Boer victories at the battles of Colenso, Spion Kop and Vaal Krantz. On 6 January 1900, Boer forces under Commandant-General Piet Joubert attempted to end the siege by taking the town before the British could launch another attempt to break the siege. This led to the battle of Platrand (or Wagon Hill) south of the town. British forces under Buller finally broke the siege on 28 February 1900 after defeating the Boers by using close cooperation between his infantry and artillery. Winston Churchill, then a young war correspondent for &quot;The Morning Post&quot; of London, was present at the relief of Ladysmith after having been taken prisoner (between Ladysmith and Colenso) and escaping earlier during the war. Mohandas Gandhi, along with the stretcher-bearing corps that he had established earlier during the war, was involved in a number of actions that took place in and around Ladysmith during the relief.

==Geography==
Ladysmith is located on the banks of the Klip River (&quot;stone river&quot;), with the central business district and a large part of the residential areas located within the flood basin of the river. It is on the foothills of the Drakensberg mountains, about 26 km from the Van Reenen&#x27;s Pass. The town has a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cwb&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification), with warm summers and cool, dry winters. It borders on a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;). The average annual precipitation is , with most rainfall occurring during summer.

Since it was established the town has suffered severely from flooding of the Klip River. During the 110 years up to 1997 with the completion of the Qedusizi Dam, 29 serious floods occurred. Minor flooding occurred almost every year. The worst flooding in 30 years occurred in 1996 leading to R500 million in damages and the evacuation of 400 families. Efforts to control the flooding date back to the 1940s. In 1949 the Windsor Dam was completed, but this dam silted up very quickly and was not an effective means of flood control.

===Climate===
== Transport ==

=== Air ===
Ladysmith is served by a small airport, located on the western outskirts of the town just below Platrand at .

=== Rail ===
The Danskraal Yard is located on the Free State main line and the Glencoe–Vryheid line and acts as a depot for train marshalling and maintenance as well as rail maintenance. The passenger station is located some distance away from Danskraal close to the Central Business District.

=== Road ===
The N11 links Ladysmith with Newcastle in the north and with the N3 Freeway in the south-west, while the R103 provides access to Colenso in the south and the N3 Freeway in the west. Traffic traveling between Durban and Johannesburg used to pass through Ladysmith up until the late 1980s, but the completion of the N3 Toll Highway, bypassing Ladysmith to the west, has caused a dramatic drop in traffic volumes through this town as well as others that are now bypassed. In that regard, the old main road through Ladysmith is now designated as the R103.

== Society and culture ==
The only sold local newspaper in Ladysmith is the &quot;Ladysmith Gazette&quot;. It is believed to have been established in 1902, and is part of the Caxton Group of newspapers. 
Two free local newspapers are the &quot;Ladysmith Herald&quot; and the &quot;Times of Ladysmith&quot;.. 5 South African Infantry Battalion is based in Ladysmith. A military shooting range is located on the outskirts of the town between the Aerodrome and Platrand.

Other buildings of interest are the Siege Museum, built in 1884 as a marketplace and opened as a museum in 1995. Detailing the battles and history at the time of the Siege, the museum holds around 60,000 documents related to the Siege and the Boer War. The Town Hall was damaged by Boer artillery during the Second Boer War. A large number of the Second Boer War Battlefields around Ladysmith have been preserved as memorial sites. Monuments and memorials to those who died during the battles have been erected at most of them. Two RML 6.3 inch Howitzers used by the British during the Siege stand in front of the Town Hall.
Located just south of the town, the Platrand/Wagon Hill area saw action during the Relief of Ladysmith. The Burgher Memorial on Wagon Hill, a sculpture of six hands pointing upwards and one downwards, was erected in 1979 in honour of 781 Boer forces killed in the battles in Natal during the Second Boer War. A crypt at the center contains the remains of 310 re-interred burghers. On Platrand there are memorials to the Imperial Light Horse, the Devonshire Regiment, the Earl of Ava and a number of others.

Ladysmith is the hometown of Joseph Shabalala, founder of the group Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Thulani &quot;Sugar Boy&quot; Malinga, a champion boxer, was born in Ladysmith. Thamsanqa Gabuza, a soccer player, who plays for Orlando Pirates, was born in Ladysmith.
Christianity has a strong presence in and around Ladysmith. It can be seen through the places of worship built around the time of the Anglo Boer wars. One such structure includes the Anglican All Saints Church, built in 1902 from cut flagstones from a quarry in the area. Islam also has a strong presence in the town, which is well known for the Soofie Mosque on the banks of the Klip River. Built in 1969, it is regarded as one of the finest in the country. The origins of the structure date back to 1895 when Hazrath Soofie Saheb arrived in South Africa. He made it his mission to build as many as 12 mosques along the east coast of Durban. Ladysmith was also the home of a revered saint known as Hazrath Soofie Sayed Mahomed Abed Mia Osmani, who is buried in the Ladysmith Muslim Cemetery.

For Hinduism, Sanathan Dharma Sabha was inaugurated to promote religious, social, cultural and education activities in Ladysmith in 1902. The oldest Hindu temple resulted from the amalgamation of Hindu Thirukootam (1910) with the Shree Ganaser Temple and hall erected in 1916. It was declared a national monument in November 1990. The present site of the SDS temple (Sanathan Dharma Sabha aka Lord Vishnu Temple) also housed Mahatma Gandhi who established a non-White Stretcher-bearer service in the Ambulance Corps in the Ladysmith and Spioenkop during the Anglo-Boer War.

There are also Rastafarian devotees within the areas surrounding Ladysmith, residing in Waters Meet, Peace Town, eZakheni, Steadville, Saint Chads, Acaciaville and Roosbom.

<text>The four-lined skink (Plestiodon tetragrammus) is a species of lizard, which is endemic to North America. It is a medium-sized member of the &quot;Plestiodon&quot; skinks.

==Taxonomy==
At least two subspecies are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies:
* Long-lined skink, &quot;P. t. tetragrammus&quot; 
* Short-lined skink, &quot;P. t. brevilineatus&quot; 

Some herpetologists also consider the mountain skink (&quot;Plestiodon callicephalus&quot;) to be a subspecies of &quot;Plestiodon tetragrammus&quot; under the name &quot;P. t. callicephalus&quot;. Others, however, prefer to treat the mountain skink as a distinct species because its range is geographically distinct and there are morphological differences.

==Description==
The two subspecies can be distinguished by their color and their stripes. The long-lined skink is gray to light brown in color and has light stripes from the eyes extending to beyond its forelegs, whereas the short-lined skink is darker in color and has stripes that end before the forelegs.

Juveniles of both subspecies have — like many &quot;Plestiodon&quot; — a blue tail; this color fades with age.

Adults reach a maximum SVL (Snout-Vent-Length) of some 7.5 cm (about 3 inches), and a TL (total length) of about .

==Geographic range==
&quot;Plestiodon tetragrammus&quot; occurs in northern Mexico and along the Mexican Gulf coast and in western and central Texas.

==Habitat==
Both subspecies live in lightly wooded areas, with the short-lined skink having a preference for rocky areas, whereas the long-lined skink is also found in grasslands.

==Reproduction==
The female lays about 5 to 12 eggs once a year, which she broods. Males develop orange (short-lined skink) to red (long-lined skink) coloration of the head during the breeding season.

<text>Prosh is a satirical annual newspaper written by students at the University of Western Australia to raise funds for nominated charities.

==Annual event==

The annual tradition is the collaboration of a team of voluntary students who write, design and edit a spoof newspaper designed to poke fun at current events and political agendas. Content varies, but often contains elements of potty humour, black humour and social and political commentary. Every April the paper is distributed to the public of Perth&#x27;s metropolitan area by students dressed in costume in exchange for a donation, often a &quot;gold coin&quot; donation. However, most collectors are willing to accept any sort of small change or cash donation. The day is also marked by a procession through the streets of Perth. The event now involves many carefully designed floats, practical jokes and stunts which are played on the public by participating students.

==History==

In 1931, a small group of students compiled a small, satirical newspaper called the &quot;SRUSS SRUSS Times&quot; as part of graduation celebrations. Later that week, the Perth newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; berated the creators of the newspaper, calling it trash and filth, and the creators were subsequently penalised, in the form of a fine payable to a local children&#x27;s charity.

In the 1950s the newspaper reappeared as &quot;Prosh&quot;. The name was derived from the inability of inebriated students to pronounce the word “procession” without slurring. Over the decades of the &quot;Prosh&quot; procession through Perth, various floats and vehicles of dubious form and function passed through the centre of the city.

Currently, &quot;Prosh&quot; (which is now one of the oldest UWA traditions) is kept alive by volunteers writing, editing and distributing the newspaper annually in April. Each year a new group of charities are chosen as the beneficiaries of all money raised by &quot;Prosh&quot;, with more than $100,000 raised each year.

==Controversy==
In 2013,&quot; Prosh&quot; published a &quot;dreamtime horoscope&quot; that mocked Indigenous Australians with reference to excessive drinking and disproportional financial support from the government. The incident received national media attention and an apology was issued by the UWA Student Guild who committed to changing policies and guidelines for &quot;Prosh&quot; publications.

<text>Hydropneumatic suspension is a type of motor vehicle suspension system, invented by Paul Magès, produced by Citroën, and fitted to Citroën cars, as well as being used under licence by other car manufacturers. Similar systems are also widely used on modern tanks and other large military vehicles. The suspension was referred to as &quot; in early literature, pointing to oil and air as its main components.

The purpose of this system is to provide a sensitive, dynamic and high-capacity suspension that offers superior ride quality on a variety of surfaces. A hydropneumatic system combines the advantages of hydraulic systems and pneumatic systems so that gas absorbs excessive force and liquid in hydraulics directly transfers force. The suspension system usually features both self-leveling and driver-variable ride height, to provide extra clearance in rough terrain.

This type of suspension for automobiles was inspired by the pneumatic suspension used for aircraft landing gear, which was also partly filled with oil for lubrication and to prevent gas leakage, as patented in 1933 by the same company. The principles illustrated by the successful use of hydropneumatic suspension are now used in a broad range of applications, such as aircraft oleo struts and gas filled automobile shock absorbers.

== Description ==
Hydropneumatic suspension is a type of motor vehicle suspension system, invented by Paul Magès, produced by Citroën, and fitted to Citroën cars. The suspension was referred to as &quot; in early literature, pointing to oil and air as its main components.&lt;ref name=&quot;air-techniques.fr/suspension-hydropneumatique&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google/patent/EP0118335B1/fr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was also used under licence by other car manufacturers, notably Rolls-Royce (Silver Shadow), Bmw 5-Series e34 Touring, Maserati (Quattroporte II) and Peugeot. It was also used on Berliet trucks and has been used on Mercedes-Benz cars, where it is known as &quot;Active Body Control.&quot; The Toyota Soarer UZZ32 &quot;Limited&quot; was fitted with a fully integrated four-wheel steering and a complex, computer-controlled hydraulic &quot;Toyota Active Control Suspension&quot; in 1991. Similar systems are also widely used on modern tanks and other large military vehicles.

==Effects==
The purpose of this system is to provide a sensitive, dynamic and high-capacity suspension that offers superior ride quality on a variety of surfaces. The suspension system usually features both self-leveling and driver-variable ride height, to provide extra clearance in rough terrain. Hydropneumatic suspension has a number of natural advantages over steel springs, generally recognized in the auto industry. In a hydropneumatic system, gas absorbs excessive force, whereas liquid in hydraulics directly transfers force, which combines the advantages of two technological principles:
* Hydraulic systems use torque multiplication in an easy way, independent of the distance between the input and output, without the need for mechanical gears or levers.
* Pneumatic systems are based on the fact that gas is compressible, so equipment is less subject to shock damage.
Suspension and springing technology is not generally well understood by consumers, leading to a public perception that hydropneumatics are merely &quot;good for comfort&quot;. They also have advantages related to handling and control efficiency, solving a number of problems inherent in steel springs that suspension designers have previously struggled to eliminate. Although auto manufacturers understood the inherent advantages over steel springs, there were two problems. First, it was patented by the inventor, and second it had a perceived element of complexity, so automakers like Mercedes-Benz, British Leyland (Hydrolastic, Hydragas), and Lincoln sought to create simpler variants using a compressed air suspension.

Citroën&#x27;s application of the system had the disadvantage that only garages equipped with special tools and knowledge were qualified to work on the cars, making them radically different from ordinary cars with common mechanicals. France was noted for the poor quality of its roads after World War II, but the hydropneumatic suspension as fitted to the Citroën ID/DS and later cars reportedly ensured a smooth and stable ride there.

Hydropneumatic suspension offers no natural roll stiffness. There have been many improvements to the system over the years, including steel anti-roll bars, variable ride firmness (Hydractive), and active control of body roll (Citroën Activa).

==Basic mechanical layout==

This system uses a belt- or camshaft-driven pump from the engine to pressurise a special hydraulic fluid, which then powers the brakes, suspension and power steering.&lt;ref name=&quot;tramontana/citroen-guide&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It can also power any number of features such as the clutch, turning headlamps and even power windows.

Nitrogen is used as the trapped gas to be compressed, since it is unlikely to cause corrosion. The actuation of the nitrogen spring reservoir is performed through an incompressible hydraulic fluid inside a suspension cylinder. By adjusting the filled fluid volume within the cylinder, a leveling functionality is implemented. The nitrogen gas within the suspension sphere is separated from the hydraulic oil by a rubber membrane.

==History==
Citroën first introduced this system in 1954 on the rear suspension of the Traction Avant. The first four-wheel implementation was in the advanced DS in 1955. This type of suspension for automobiles was inspired by the pneumatic suspension used for aircraft landing gear, which was also partly filled with oil for lubrication and to prevent gas leakage, as patented in 1933 by the same company. Other modifications followed, with design changes such as the 1960 &quot;Double stage oleo-pneumatic shock absorber&quot; patented by Peter Fullam John and Stephan Gyurik.

Major milestones of the hydropneumatics design were:
* During World War II, Paul Magès, an employee of Citroën, with no formal training in engineering, secretly develops the concept of an oil and air suspension to combine a new level of softness with vehicle control and self-levelling.
* 1954 Traction Avant 15H: Rear suspension, using LHS hydraulic fluid.
* 1955 Citroën DS: Suspension, power steering, brakes and gearbox/clutch assembly powered by high pressure hydraulic assistance. A belt driven 7-piston pump, similar in size to a power steering pump, generates this pressure when the engine is running.
* 1960 The United States Patent and Trademark Office issues for a &quot;Double stage oleo-pneumatic shock absorber&quot; using concepts very similar to those developed earlier by Paul MagèsPatent forms the basis for aircraft oleo struts and gas-filled shock absorbers
* 1965 Rolls-Royce licenses Citroën technology for the suspension of the new Silver Shadow
* 1967 The superior non-hygroscopic LHM mineral fluid is introduced
* 1969 Citroën M35: The Citroën M35 was a coupé derived from the Ami 8, and equipped with a Wankel engine and a hydropneumatic suspension. The bodies were produced by Heuliez from 1969 to 1971.
* 1969 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration legalizes LHM mineral fluid in the United States
* 1970 Citroën GS: Adaptation of the hydropneumatic suspension to a small car
* 1970 Citroën SM: Variable speed auto-returning power steering, dubbed DIRAVI, and hydraulically actuated directional high beams. The beams of all six headlights are maintained parallel to the road surface by a hydraulic system separate from the directional long range high beams. The headlights&#x27; steering and leveling systems are totally separate from the central system that powers the suspension, steering and brakes and use a different fluid, a glycerine type.
* 1972 BMW E12 5-series released with optional hydropneumatic rear suspension. Coil springs are retained, though softer than conventional coils for the same car. This system was offered in most BMW 5-, 6-, and 7-series models, as well as the E30 Touring (station wagon/estate), into the 1990s when it was replaced with an air suspension. Until late 1987, the hydraulic circuit was separate from the power steering, and the pump electrically powered.
* 1974 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration bans vehicles with height adjustable suspension, impacting consumers in the United States. Ban repealed 1981.
* 1974 Citroën CX: The car was one of the most modern of its time, combining Citroën&#x27;s unique hydro-pneumatic integral self-leveling suspension and speed-adjustable DIRAVI power steering (first introduced on the Citroën SM). The suspension was attached to sub frames that were fitted to the body through flexible mountings, to improve even more the ride quality and to reduce road noise. The British magazine &quot;Car&quot; described the sensation of driving a CX as hovering over road irregularities, much like a ship traversing above the ocean floor.
* 1974 Maserati Quattroporte II: was on an extended Citroën SM chassis, available since Citroën had purchased the Italian company and was the only Maserati Quattroporte to feature hydropneumatic suspension and front-wheel drive
* 1975 The Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 W116 replaces the air suspension of the &quot;6.3&quot; with hydropneumatic suspension, with the pump driven by the engine&#x27;s timing chain instead of an external belt. This adaptation was used only for the suspension. Power steering and brakes were conventional hydraulic- and vacuum-powered, respectively.
* 1980 Mercedes-Benz W126 500SEL used hydropneumatic suspension as optional, later this system was available on 420SEL and 560SEL models.
* 1983 Citroën BX, built as a 4WD in 1990
* 1984 Mercedes-Benz W124 selected models of E class had this technology (rear only hydraulic suspension) height adjustable suspension and self-levelling suspension mixed with coil springs.
* 1987 BMW E30 3-series Touring (station wagon/estate) begins production in July, offering the same self-leveling hydropneumatic rear suspension as previous BMW, with the difference that the pump is a parallel circuit on the belt-driven steering assist pump, and shares its fluid. Starting in September, the E32 7-series (in production since June &#x27;86) switches to this pump from the previous electric pump. The BMW E34 5-series begins production in November, also with this new pump.
* 1989 Citroën XM: Hydractive Suspension, electronic regulation of the hydropneumatic system; sensors measure acceleration and other factors 
* 1990 Peugeot 405 Mi16x4: first Peugeot equipped with rear hydropneumatic suspension
* 1990 JCB Fastrac high speed agricultural tractor uses this system for its rear suspension.
* 1991 Toyota Soarer UZZ32 used hydraulic struts controlled by an array of sensors with yaw velocity sensors, vertical G sensors, height sensors, wheel speed sensors, longitudinal and lateral G sensors) that detected cornering, acceleration and braking force.
* 1993 Citroën Xantia used hydropneumatic, on 1995 Optional &quot;Activa&quot; (active suspension) system, eliminating body roll by acting on anti-roll bars. A &quot;Xantia Activa&quot; was able to reach more than 1g lateral acceleration, and still holds the record speed () through the moose test maneuver, due to its active anti-roll bars.

==Functioning==
At the heart of the system, acting as pressure sink as well as suspension elements, are the so-called spheres, five or six in all; one per wheel and one main accumulator as well as a dedicated brake accumulator on some models. On later cars fitted with Hydractive or Activa suspension, there may be as many as ten spheres. Spheres consist of a hollow metal ball, open to the bottom, with a flexible Desmopan rubber membrane, fixed at the &#x27;equator&#x27; inside, separating top and bottom. The top is filled with nitrogen at high pressure, up to 75 bar, the bottom connects to the car&#x27;s hydraulic fluid circuit. The high pressure pump, powered by the engine, pressurizes the hydraulic fluid (LHM – liquide hydraulique minéral) and an accumulator sphere maintains a reserve of hydraulic power. This part of the circuit is at between 150 and 180 bars. It powers the front brakes first, prioritised via a security valve, and depending on type of vehicle, can power the steering, clutch, gear selector, etc.

Pressure flows from the hydraulic circuit to the suspension cylinders, pressurizing the bottom part of the spheres and suspension cylinders. Suspension works by means of a piston forcing LHM into the sphere, compressing the nitrogen in the upper part of the sphere; damping is provided by a two-way &#x27;leaf valve&#x27; in the opening of the sphere. LHM has to squeeze back and forth through this valve which causes resistance and controls the suspension movements. It is the simplest damper and one of the most efficient. Ride height correction (self leveling) is achieved by height corrector valves connected to the anti-roll bar, front and rear. When the car is too low, the height corrector valve opens to allow more fluid into the suspension cylinder (e.g., the car is loaded). When the car is too high (e.g. after unloading) fluid is returned to the system reservoir via low-pressure return lines. Height correctors act with some delay in order not to correct regular suspension movements. The rear brakes are powered from the rear suspension circuit. Because the pressure there is proportional to the load, so is the braking power.

== Working fluid ==
Citroën quickly realized that standard brake fluid was not ideally suited to high pressure hydraulics, and developed a special red-coloured hydraulic fluid named LHS (), which they used from 1954 to 1967. The chief problem with LHS was that it absorbed moisture and dust from the air, which caused corrosion in the system. Most hydraulic brake systems are sealed from the outside air by a rubber diaphragm in the reservoir filler cap, but the Citroën system had to be vented to allow the fluid level in the reservoir to rise and fall, thus it was not hermetically sealed. Consequently, each time the suspension would rise, the fluid level in the reservoir dropped, drawing in fresh moisture-laden air. The large surface of the fluid in the reservoir readily absorbed moisture. Since the system recirculates fluid continually through the reservoir, all the fluid was repeatedly exposed to the air and its moisture content.
To overcome these shortcomings of LHS, Citroën developed a new green fluid, &quot;LHM&quot; (). LHM is a mineral oil, quite close to automatic transmission fluid. Mineral oil is hydrophobic, unlike standard brake fluid; therefore, water-vapour bubbles do not form in the system, as would be the case with standard brake fluid, creating a &quot;spongy&quot; brake feel. Use of mineral oil has thus spread beyond Citroën, Rolls-Royce, Peugeot, and Mercedes-Benz, to include Jaguar, Audi, and BMW.

LHM, being a mineral oil, absorbs only an infinitesimal proportion of moisture, plus it contains corrosion inhibitors. The dust inhalation problem continued, so a filter assembly was fitted into the hydraulic reservoir. Cleaning the filters and changing the fluid at the recommended intervals removes most dust and wear particles from the system, ensuring the longevity of the system. Failure to keep the oil clean is the main cause of problems. It is also imperative to always use the correct fluid for the system; the two types of fluids and their associated system components are not interchangeable. If the wrong type of fluid is used, the system must be drained and rinsed with Hydraflush (Total&#x27;s Hydraurincage), before draining again and filling with the correct fluid. These procedures are clearly described in DIY manuals obtainable from automotive retailers.

The latest Citroën cars with Hydractive 3 suspension have a new orange coloured &quot;LDS&quot; hydraulic fluid. This lasts longer and requires less frequent attention. It conforms to DIN 51524-3 for HVLP.

== Manufacturing ==

The whole high pressure part of the system is manufactured from steel tubing of small diameter, connected to valve control units by Lockheed type pipe unions with special seals made from Desmopan, a type of polyurethane thermoplastic compatible with the LHM fluid. The moving parts of the system, &quot;e.g.&quot;, suspension strut or steering ram, are sealed by contact seals between the cylinder and piston for tightness under pressure. The other plastic/rubber parts are return tubes from valves such as the brake control or height corrector valves, also catching seeping fluid around the suspension push-rods. Height corrector, brake master valve and steering valve spools, and hydraulic pump pistons have extremely small clearances (1–3 micrometres) within their cylinders, permitting only a very low leakage rate. The metal and alloy parts of the system rarely fail, even after excessively high mileages, but the elastomer components (especially those exposed to the air) can harden and leak, typical failure points for the system.

Spheres are not subject to mechanical wear, but suffer pressure loss, due to the pressurised nitrogen diffusing through the membrane. They can, however, be recharged, which is cheaper than replacing them. When Citroën designed their Hydractive 3 suspension they redesigned the spheres with new nylon membranes, which greatly slow the rate of deflation. These are recognisable by their grey colouring.

Classic (non-saucer) green- (and grey-) coloured suspension spheres typically last between 60,000 and 100,000 km. Spheres originally had a threaded plug on top for recharging. Newer (&#x27;saucer&#x27;) spheres do not have this plug, but it can be retrofitted, enabling them to be recharged with gas. The sphere membrane has an indefinite life unless run at low pressure, which leads to rupture. Timely recharging, approximately every 3 years, is thus vital. A ruptured membrane means suspension loss at the attached wheel; however, ride height is unaffected. With no springing other than the (slight) flexibility of tyres, hitting a pothole with a flat sphere can bend the suspension parts or dent a wheel rim. In the case of main accumulator sphere failure, the high pressure pump is the only source of braking pressure for the front wheels. Some older cars had a separate front brake accumulator on power steering models.

The old LHS and LHS2 (coloured red) cars used a different elastomer in the diaphragms and seals that is &quot;not&quot; compatible with green LHM. The orange LDS fluid in Hydractive cars is also incompatible with other fluids.

== Legacy ==
The principles illustrated by the successful use of hydropneumatic suspension are now used in a broad range of applications, such as aircraft oleo struts and gas filled automobile shock absorbers, first patented in the U.S. in 1934 by Cleveland Pneumatic Tool Co. Similar systems are also widely used on modern tanks and other large military vehicles.

=== Hydractive ===
Hydractive Suspension is an automotive technology introduced by Citroën in 1990. The prototype debuted in 1988 on the Citroën Activa concept. It describes a development of the 1954 hydropneumatic suspension design using additional electronic sensors and driver control of suspension performance. The driver can make the suspension stiffen (sport mode) or ride in outstanding comfort (soft mode). Sensors in the steering, brakes, suspension, throttle pedal and gearbox feed information on the car&#x27;s speed, acceleration, and road conditions to an on-board computer, which in turn activates or deactivates an extra pair of suspension spheres on the circuit, to enable either a more smooth supple ride or tighter handling in corners. On the Activa and Activa 2, the car leaned inwards by one degree in turnsCitroën acknowledged that this was somewhat of a marketing gimmick, and that a lean of zero degrees was optimal.

An additional, perhaps unexpected, benefit of active suspension is that fuel consumption and tire wear is lowered overall. The negative camber designed into most suspensions in order to maximize the size of the contact patch when turning leads to tire scrub, which wears out tires and increases fuel consumption.

==== Hydractive 1 and Hydractive 2 ====
Citroën Hydractive (and later Hydractive 2) suspension was available on several models, including the XM and Xantia, which had a more advanced sub-model known as the Activa. The first Hydractive suspension systems (now known as Hydractive 1) had two user presets, &quot;Sport&quot; and &quot;Auto&quot;. In the &quot;Sport&quot; setting the car&#x27;s suspension was always kept in its firmest mode. In the &quot;Auto&quot; setting, the suspension was switched from soft to firm mode temporarily when a speed-dependent threshold in accelerator pedal movement, brake pressure, steering wheel angle, or body movement was detected by one of several sensors.

In Hydractive 2, the preset names were changed to &quot;Sport&quot; and &quot;Normal&quot;. In this new version the &quot;Sport&quot; setting would no longer keep the suspension system in firm mode, but instead lowered the thresholds significantly for any of the sensor readings also used in &quot;Normal&quot; mode, allowing for a similar level of body firmness during cornering and acceleration, without the sacrifice in ride quality the &quot;Sport&quot; mode in Hydractive 1 systems had caused.

Whenever the Hydractive 1 or 2 computers received abnormal sensor information, often caused by malfunctioning electrical contacts, the car&#x27;s suspension system would be forced into its firm setting for the remainder of the ride.

Starting with Xantia model year 1994 and XM model year 1995, all models featured an additional sphere and valve that together functioned as a pressure reservoir for rear brakes because of new hydraulic locks, letting the car retain normal ride height for several weeks without running the engine. Correctly called the SC/MAC sphere, it often became known as the &#x27;anti-sink&#x27; sphere, because of its ability to better maintain rear suspension height.

==== Hydractive 3 ====
The 2001 Citroën C5 has continued development of Hydractive suspension with Hydractive 3. Compared to earlier cars, the C5 stays at normal ride height even when the engine is turned off for an extended period, through the use of electronics. The C5 also uses orange synthetic hydraulic fluid named LDS fluid in place of the green LHM mineral oil used in millions of hydropneumatic vehicles.

A further improved Hydractive 3+ variation was for cars with top engines on the Citroën C5 and in 2005 was standard on the Citroën C6. Hydractive 3+ systems contain additional spheres that can be engaged and disengaged via a &quot;Sport&quot; button, resulting in a firmer ride.

The Hydractive 3 hydraulic suspension has 2 automatic modes:
* Motorway position (lowering by 15 mm of the vehicle height above 110 km/h)
* Poor road surface position (raising by 13 mm of the vehicle height below 70 km/h)

The BHI of the Hydractive 3 suspension calculates the optimum vehicle height, using the following information:
* Vehicle speed
* Front and rear vehicle heights

The 3+ Hydractive hydraulic suspension has 3 automatic modes:
* Motorway position (lowering by 15 mm of the vehicle height above 110 km/h)
* Poor road surface position (raising by 13 mm of the vehicle height below 70 km/h)
* &quot;Comfort&quot; or &quot;dynamic&quot; suspension (variation of suspension firmness)

The BHI of the 3+ Hydractive suspension calculates the optimum vehicle height, using the following information:
* Vehicle speed
* Front and rear vehicle heights
* Rotation speed of steering wheel
* Angle of rake of steering wheel
* Vehicle&#x27;s longitudinal acceleration
* Vehicle&#x27;s lateral acceleration
* Speed of suspension travel
* Movement of the accelerator throttle

C5 I (2001–2004)
* Hydractive hydraulic suspension 3: EW7J4 and DW10TD engines.
* Hydractive hydraulic suspension 3+: EW10J4, EW10D, ES9J4S and DW12TED4 engines.

C5 II (2004–2007)
* Hydractive hydraulic suspension 3: EW7J4, EW10A, DV6TED4 and DW10BTED4 engines.
* Hydractive hydraulic suspension 3+: ES9A and DW12TED4 engines (prior to RPO No 10645).

C6 (2005–2012)
* Hydractive hydraulic suspension 3+: Standard on all models.

C5 III X7 (2007–2017)
* Hydractive hydraulic suspension 3+: Depends on country and trim.

<text>Red Pike is a classified United Kingdom government encryption algorithm, proposed for use by the National Health Service by GCHQ, but designed for a &quot;broad range of applications in the British government&quot; . Little is publicly known about Red Pike, except that it is a block cipher with a 64-bit block size and 64-bit key length. According to the academic study of the cipher cited below and quoted in a paper by Ross Anderson and Markus Kuhn, it &quot;uses the same basic operations as RC5&quot; (add, XOR, and left shift) and &quot;has no look-up tables, virtually no key schedule and requires only five lines of code&quot;; &quot;the influence of each key bit quickly cascades&quot; and &quot;each encryption involves of the order of 100 operations&quot;. 64 bits of key entropy are not considered secure anymore.

Red Pike is available to approved British government contractors in software form, for use in confidential (not secret) government communication systems. GCHQ also designed the Rambutan cryptosystem for the same segment.

Given that Red Pike is a British encryption algorithm, its name likely refers to a particular fell in the western English Lake District.

==Supposed source code==
In February 2014, the supposed source code for Red Pike was posted as follows to the Cypherpunk mailing list.
 /* Red Pike cipher source code */
 #include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
 typedef uint32_t word;
 #define CONST 0x9E3779B9

 void encrypt(word * x, const word * k)
 unsigned int i;
 word rk0 = k[0];
 word rk1 = k[1];
 for (i = 0; i &lt; ROUNDS; i++)
 rk0 += CONST;
 rk1 -= CONST;
 x[0] ^= rk0;
 x[0] += x[1];
 x[0] = ROTL(x[0], x[1]);

 k[0] + CONST * (ROUNDS + 1)
 
 encrypt(x, dk);

<doc id="537173" wikidata="Q240457" url="?curid=537173" title="Theatre of Tragedy">
<text>Theatre of Tragedy was a Norwegian band from Stavanger, active between 1993 and 2010. They are best known for their earlier albums, which influenced the gothic metal genre.

==History==
===Formation (1993)===
Theatre of Tragedy was founded on 2 October 1993 by vocalist Raymond István Rohonyi, guitarists Pål Bjåstad and Tommy Lindal. Drummer Hein Frode Hansen had recently quit his former band Phobia and started looking for a new musical project to play in. A friend of his told Hein that a band called Suffering Grief was looking for a new drummer, and after contacting them, he joined the band. At the time, Suffering Grief was composed of vocalist Raymond István Rohonyi and guitarists Pål Bjåstad and Tommy Lindal. No bassist had joined the band yet, but Eirik T. Saltrø had agreed to play with them in live concerts.

After finding a rehearsal place, the band decided to work upon a couple of piano arrangements composed by Lorentz Aspen. The vocals, at the time, were almost entirely composed of raw death grunts.

After composing their first song, &quot;Lament of the Perishing Roses&quot;, the band changed its name to La Reine Noir and then to Theatre of Tragedy. They subsequently invited singer Liv Kristine Espenæs - Rohonyi&#x27;s then girlfriend - to do female vocals for one song, but quickly invited her to join the band permanently.

===First five albums (1994–2002)===

In 1994, their first studio demo was recorded, and in 1995, the debut album &quot;Theatre of Tragedy&quot; was released, followed by &quot;Velvet Darkness They Fear&quot; in 1996 and the &quot;A Rose for the Dead&quot; EP in 1997, which contained unreleased material from &quot;Velvet Darkness They Fear&quot;. Arguably, the band reached the apogee of its career in 1998, with the release of the critically acclaimed album &quot;Aégis&quot;.

Released in 2000, &quot;Musique&quot; was a massive departure from the gothic metal sound that Theatre of Tragedy had developed over the previous three albums. The heavy guitars and Early Modern English lyrics were replaced by electropop and industrial-influenced metal. It was met with a very mixed reception, and while some older fans were understandably shocked by the new direction of the band, it did gain them a number of new fans.

With 2002&#x27;s &quot;Assembly&quot;, the band continued along the same musical path as on their previous album. It was seen as a more refined and confident electropop record than its predecessor. It was also the first album to feature their long-time session guitarist, Vegard K. Thorsen, as a full member of the band.

===Departure of Liv Kristine and &quot;Storm&quot; (2003–2007)===
In August 2003, the band declared in an official statement on their website that Liv Kristine was removed from the band&#x27;s line-up due to &quot;musical differences which could not be bridged&quot;.

Female singer Nell Sigland (from The Crest) joined Theatre of Tragedy on the following year. In winter 2004/2005, the band performed a short concert tour (together with Pain, Sirenia, and Tiamat) with Sigland singing.

The band released their sixth studio album &quot;Storm&quot; on 24 March 2006, and a European tour followed, with Gothminister as supporting act. The album&#x27;s title song was released as a single on 24 February 2006. While still keeping on the industrial and electronic roots of the last two albums, the album showed a return to some of the sounds developed in their first albums.

===&quot;Forever Is the World&quot; (2008–2009)===
On 2 October 2008, Theatre of Tragedy celebrated their 15th anniversary. In December 2008 the band posted a snippet of new track &quot;Frozen,&quot; which was expected to be on the new album, on their MySpace music page:
&quot;Time for some updates. Things are slowly moving forward with the next album. As usual with the Theatre machinery there is many things to take into consideration when doing stuff and recently we were forced to change collaborators for the production of the album, and postpone the recordings. But fear not the heavy responsibility has been entrusted to Alexander Møklebust (Zeromancer, Seigmen, Gåte, Monomen, Delaware etc) and the ToT crew will enter Room 13 in May and June for recordings and general mayhem! Estimated release from AFM is end of September. Rumor has it that there will be a vinyl version for the diehard fans. We will keep you posted.&quot;
In June 2009 saw the band reveal &quot;Forever Is the World&quot; as the title of the new album. Their 7th album was released in Europe on 21 September 2009, with the band making a step towards their earlier sound of &quot;Aégis&quot;. A special tour edition of &quot;Forever Is the World&quot; was issued on 12 March 2010. The tour edition contained a bonus CD known as the &quot;Addenda EP&quot;, which contains song reworkings and unreleased tracks.

Metal Mind Productions issued a press release in July stating that they were, with the co-operation of the band, re-releasing &quot;Musique&quot; and &quot;Assembly&quot;. Both albums have been remastered and will be backed with bonus tracks. New liner notes and artwork are said to be a part of the package. Each album is limited to 2000 numbered copies.

===Breakup and aftermath (2010–present)===
On 1 March 2010, Theatre of Tragedy issued a statement informing fans of their decision to split on 2 October 2010. The statement cited personal desires to spend more time with family and an inability to juggle their everyday working lives with a &quot;rock and roll&quot; lifestyle. On 12 March, Theatre of Tragedy kicked off their farewell tour, &quot;Forever is the World Tour&quot;. The Norwegian symphonic goth metal band Where Angels Fall opened for them on the European part of the tour. In September, fans helped the band to secure funds to finish their first and last DVD by making donations when the label pulled out most of the funding for the production. The result was Last Curtain Call, a concert film from their very last show on 2 October 2010 in their hometown Stavanger.

On 5 July 2013, the band&#x27;s first three albums were re-released and remastered.

In December 2015, Liv Kristine did a tour across Germany, Belgium, Russia, Poland, Netherlands, and United Kingdom, with her own solo project. She performed songs from her solo project and from Theatre of Tragedy like she usually does in solo concerts. Moreover, Raymond István Rohonyi joined her on this tour. She also played at the Metal Female Voices Fest XIII on 23 October 2016 along with Raymond. They also played a few songs of Theatre of Tragedy like they did in December 2015. The band members have stated, however, that there are no plans for a Theatre of Tragedy reunion, explaining that it is &quot;as likely as a Doors reunion with the original lineup. No one has been approached or not approached.&quot;

==Musical style==
The band made use of contrasting vocals – male bass vocals (making some use of death grunts) and female soprano singing (commonly referred to as &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; vocals) – and on their first three albums, presented lyrics written predominantly in Early Modern English. Starting from the album &quot;Musique&quot;, however, Theatre of Tragedy made drastic changes to its style, which became significantly inspired by the industrial rock genre, abandoning Early Modern English writing and death grunts in the process.
On their two last releases, &quot;Storm&quot; and &quot;Forever Is The World&quot;, the band returned to a more classic gothic rock/metal sound.

<text>Cheiromeles is a genus of bats in the family Molossidae, the free-tailed bats. The genus was erected and described by Thomas Horsfield, who developed the name from the Greek word &quot;cheir&quot; (&quot;hand&quot;), a reference to the hand-like hindfoot, which has a toe that flexes like an opposable thumb. These bats have mostly hairless bodies and fold their wings into pouches of skin along their bodies when at rest. These are among the largest insectivorous bats, weighing up to 135 grams.

There are two species in this genus:
*Lesser naked bat &quot;Cheiromeles parvidens&quot;
*Hairless bat &quot;Cheiromeles torquatus&quot;

<text>Sokoto is a major city located in extreme north-western Nigeria, near the confluence of the Sokoto River and the Rima River. As of 2006, it had a population of over 427,760. Sokoto is the modern-day capital of Sokoto State and was previously the capital of the north-western states. Modern Sokoto is known for trading sheepskins, cattle hides, leather crafts (a significant export), kola nuts and goatskins.

The historic seat of the former Sokoto Caliphate, the city is predominantly Muslim and an important seat of Islamic learning in Nigeria. The Sultan who heads the caliphate is effectively the spiritual leader of Nigerian Muslims.

== Name and etymology ==

The name Sokoto (which is the modern/anglicised version of the local name, &quot;Sakkwato&quot;) is of Arabic origin, representing &quot;sooq&quot;, &#x27;market&#x27; in English. It is also known as &quot;Sakkwato, Birnin Shaihu da Bello&quot; or &quot;Sokoto, City of Shaihu and Bello&quot; (Shaihu referring to Sheikh Usman dan Fodio, founder of the Sokoto Caliphate, and Bello his son/successor, Sultan Muhammad Bello).

== Climate ==

Sokoto has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;). It is located in the dry Sahel, surrounded by sandy savannah and isolated hills.

With an annual average temperature of , Sokoto is one of the hottest cities in Nigeria. However the maximum daytime temperatures are generally under most of the year, and the dryness makes the heat bearable. The warmest months are February to April, where daytime temperatures can exceed 40 °C. The highest recorded temperature is 45 °C. The rainy season is from June to October, during which showers are a daily occurrence. The showers rarely last long and are a far cry from the regular torrential showers known in many tropical regions. From late October to February, during the &#x27;cold season&#x27;, the climate is dominated by the harmattan wind blowing Sahara dust over the land. The dust dims the sunlight, thereby reducing temperatures significantly.

The region&#x27;s lifeline for growing crops is the floodplains of the Sokoto-Rima river system, which are covered with rich alluvial soil. For the rest, the crops cultivated in Sokoto includes millet, guinea corn, beans perhaps being the most abundant, followed by maize, rice, sesame, other cereals and vegetables such as: onions, tomatoes, pepper, garden egg, lettuce, and cabbage. Apart from millet, Sokoto is the major onion producer in Nigeria. In terms of vegetation, Sokoto falls within the savannah zone. This is an open tse-tse fly-free grassland suitable for cultivation of grain crops and animal husbandry. Rain starts late and ends early with mean annual rainfall ranging between 500 mm and 1,300 mm. There are two major seasons in Sokoto, namely wet and dry. The dry season starts from October, and lasts up to April in some parts and may extend to May or June in other parts. The wet season on the other hand begins in most parts of the state in May and lasts up to September, or October. The harmattan, a dry, cold, and fairly dusty wind is experienced in the state between November and February. Heat is more severe in the state in March and April. But the weather in the state is always cold in the morning and hot in the afternoons, save in peak harmattan period.

The topography of the state is dominated by the Hausa plain of northern Nigeria. The vast irrigable land of the Sokoto-Rima River systems dissects the plain and provides the rich alluvial soil fit for a variety of crop cultivation in the state. There are also isolated hills and mountains scattered all over the state.

== Historical development ==


Sokoto had been used as early as October 1804 by the Shehu Usmanu Dan Fodiyo as the venue for the meeting with Galadima, Yunfa&#x27;s Vizier. Subsequently, it was used by his son Muhammad Bello as a staging post for an attack on Dufua in the spring of 1806. Bovil suggested that the area/district may have been known as Sokoto as early as the seventeenth century. In a historical perspective, Sokoto was founded as a ribat (military camp or frontier) in 1809, when Shehu Usmanu was at Sifawa. It later became the capital of the caliphate after Shehu&#x27;s death.

In the 1820s, Sokoto was at its peak of prosperity coinciding with the peak of its &#x27;rulers&#x27; powers at the center of the caliphate, receiving annual tribute from all the fiefs before a long period of decline. The explorer Hugh Clapperton (1827) was highly impressed by this prosperity and its effects on the city.

Clapperton noted the importance of Sokoto&#x27;s closely settled surroundings: The rivers, rather than long-distance trade in the city&#x27;s economy. But trading activities in Sokoto is presently inconsiderable, owing to the disturbed state of the surrounding country.

By the time the explorer Heinrich Barth arrived in 1853, Sokoto was thinly inhabited and greatly dilapidated. Barth in 1857 estimated the population at only 20,000–22,000, but the market was still supplied and attended, and a thriving suburb outside the wall was more animated than Sokoto itself.

Bovil aptly described Sokoto as a strong position, with steep escarpments from the east to the north-west and a small valley on the west and the south west protecting it against surprise cavalry attacks. The town dominates the broad lowland where the two rivers, Rima and Sokoto meet, being the junction of roads from Gobir in the north, Kebbi in the south and Burmi Zamfara in the east.

In the early 19th century, the town (Sokoto) was divided into wards. Such wards include Magajin Gari ward, Waziri ward, Sarkin Musulmi ward, Sarkin Adar ward, Magajin Rafi ward, and Sarkin Zamfara Ward. At this time the wards were small and surrounded with a wall, which included the mosques of Sultan Bello and Shehu, Sultan Palace and other buildings as well as the compound of Shehu.

In 1818, the wall was extended up to the extent that it has gates that come in and out of the Birni wall. Such gates are Kofar-Kade, Kofar-Kware, Kofar-Rini, Kofar-Dundaye, Kofar-Taramniya, Kofar-Aliyu Jedo, and Kofar-Marke.

The area of the present Sokoto was the home of many empires and kingdoms of the pre-colonial western Sudan. These include the Gobir and Kebbi kingdoms as well as the world-renowned caliphate whose spiritual and political capital is the headquarters of the state.

Following the conquest of the caliphate by the British in 1903, its various components were made autonomous and joined into the government of Northern Nigeria. The northern region was thus made up of mainly parts of the Sokoto caliphate and Kanem-Bornu Empire. This continued up to January 1967 when states were created to replace regional governments by General Yakubu Gowon. Sokoto became the headquarters of the north-western state created in 1967. In 1976 following the creation of Niger state out of North Western state, Sokoto state emerged with its headquarters. Yet in Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states were carved out of Sokoto, in 1991 and 1996 respectively.

Sokoto metropolis has thus been the capital of various governments since its establishment by Caliph Muhammad Bello in 1809.

== People and culture ==
Sokoto state has a projected population of 3.7 million people based on a 2006 census made up of two ethnic groups namely, Fulani and Hausa. Sokoto town, the capital of Sokoto state, has a population of approximately 2.5 million. Apart from Fulani and Hausa, there are the Zabarmawa and Tuareg minorities in the local government border areas. All these groups speak Hausa as a common language. Fulfulde is spoken by the Fulani.

Hausa people in the state are made up of Gobirawa, Zamfarawa, Kabawa, Adarawa and Arawa. The Fulani&#x27;s on the other hand are of two main groups; the town Fulani (; ) and the Nomads. The former includes the Torankawa, the clan of Shehu Usmanu Danfodiyo, Sullubawa and Zoramawa. The Torankawa are the aristocratic class since 1804.

Culturally the state is homogeneous. The people of the state are predominantly Muslim. Their mode of dress is also of Islamic origin. Two major festivals namely, Eid-el-Fitri and Eid-el-Kabir are celebrated in the state every year. The former marks the end of the Ramadan fast, while the latter features the slaughtering of rams in commemoration of an act of the Islamic prophet Ibrahim (the Jewish patriarch Abraham).

Traditional wrestling (Kokawa) and boxing (Dambe) are the two sports enjoyed by the Hausa while the Fulani and the Sullubawa entertain themselves with Sharo and Doro respectively. Important visitors to the state are usually treated to the grand or mini durbar, an event involving the parade of heavily decorated horses and camels mounted by men in full traditional military and cultural attire.

== Pollution ==
The public in Sokoto is at serious risk for serious health problems as a result of the airborne dust, which can cause lung conditions and increase mortality rates, particularly from cardiovascular causes.

==Economic activities==

Over eighty percent (80%) of the inhabitants of Sokoto practice one form of agriculture or another. They produce crops like millet, guinea corn, maize, rice, potatoes, cassava, groundnuts, beans etc.for subsistence and produce wheat, cotton and vegetables for cash. Local crafts such as blacksmithing, weaving, dyeing, carving and leather works also play an important role in the economic life of the people of Sokoto; as a result, different areas like Makera, Marina, Takalmawa and Majema became important. Sokoto is also one of the fish producing areas of the country. Thus a large number of people along the river basin engage in fishing.

Sokoto is equally endowed with natural and mineral resources. Agro allied industries using cotton, groundnut, sorghum, gum, maize, rice, wheat, sugar cane, cassava, gum Arabic and tobacco as raw materials can be established in the area. Large scale farming can also be practice in the state using irrigation water from Goronyo Dam, Lugu, Kalmalo, Wammakko and Kwakwazo lakes among others.

Mineral resources such as kaolin, gypsum, limestone, laterite, red mills, phosphate both yellow and green, shade clay, sand etc., are available in commercial quantities. Mineral based industries using these raw materials could be established in the state.

The absence of the tse-tse fly on the open grassland benefits both wild and domestic animals. Sokoto ranks second in livestock production in the country&#x27;s animal population of well over eight million.

The availability of these economic potentials provides good investment opportunities, particularly in agro-allied industries such as flour mills, tomatoes processing, sugar refining, textiles, glue, tanning, fish canning, etc.

==Transport==
Sokoto lacks a public transport system. Transport within the city (when not by foot) is mainly by mopeds which operate as one-person taxis and sometimes tricycles transport persons from one place to the other; this allows for carriage of more than one person at a time (still at a cheap price as mopeds). Buses and taxis are infrequent and are generally used only for transport between cities.

Remarkably for an area where fewer than 2% of girls finish secondary school, an all-female garage has been established in Sokoto city to train young women on vehicle maintenance. Founded by the Nana: Girls and Women Empowerment Initiative, the garage trains 25 female apprentices with the support of the local Islamic leadership.

10 km south of Sokoto there is an international airport with regular connections to Abuja, Kano and Lagos.

==Industry==

In August 2008, an agreement was signed for the construction of a cement works in Sokoto, and the plant was opened in 2022.

==Urbanization==

Urbanization has a very long history in Hausaland. The process started when certain strategic areas of Hausaland developed from Kauyuka to Birane. Yet one of the major consequences of the jihadist was the speeding of this phenomenon not only in Hausaland but also in all areas affected by the caliphate administration. New towns sprang up and the older birane entered into a period of unprecedented growth, some as new areas of commercial activities, others as both Emirate capitals and centers of administration and commerce.

One of the aspects of urbanization in the history of the Sokoto caliphate started with the establishment of Sokoto city (the headquarters of the caliphate). In the prejihad period, the area between the Gobir Kingdom and Kebbi was the area commonly referred to as &quot;nomad land&quot;. But with the success of the jihad led by the Shehu usmau dan Fodiyo (1804–1808) and subsequent victory of the jihadists over the rulers of Hausaland, Sokoto city (headquarters of the caliphate) was built by Muhammad Bello.
Moreover, as observed by Abdul-Razaq Shehu in his book &quot;Sakkwato Birnin Shehu&quot;), Sokoto city was designed on paper by Muhammad Bello even before it was built. Bello, son of the Sheikh, was among his father&#x27;s lieutenants and war commanders. He fought the hardest and longest wars and was the architect of the caliphate Sokoto Birnin Shehu.

Sokoto city as designed by the architect Muhammad Bello consisted of all the characteristic features of any modern city including roads, bridges, market, ganuwa (fortification round centers of town) and as well as administrative and commercial centers. Among the administrative centers designed by Muhammad Bello are Kanwuri, Binanchi, Galadanci, Alkalanci, Dogarawa and so on. However, apart from the central market popularly known as Yardole, other commercial areas designed by Muhammad Bello include Makera, Madinka, Marina, Siriddawa, Takalmawa, Runji and Jirgawa. In addition, among other things no town in either pre-jihad or 19th century Hausaland could develop into an urban center without effective fortification (ganuwa). This was built with many strongpoints like Kofar Aliyu Jedo, Kofar Dundaye, Kofar Marke, Kofar Rini, Kofar Kware, and Kofar Taramniya, and this paramount development attracted many people to migrate from their locality into Sokoto city for survival.

From the above observation on how caliph Muhammad Bello designed the city of Sokoto we will see that Sokoto witnessed more immigrants with interest in blacksmithing leather works, pottery etc. For example, some of these people either engage in the business of blacksmithing or in other related business as in Makera Assada. There are people who used to travel to different parts of present Nigeria and even in neighbouring countries to buy damaged iron materials like damaged vehicles, cars, lorries, aircraft etc. iron pipes, and oil tanks in order to break them into pieces and sell them for anybody who wants to put them into use or modify them into another product.

== Environmental issues ==

=== Climate change ===
Because Sokoto and the urban area around it is already located near a semi-arid zone experiencing desertification, the city already experiences the effects of climate change. A 2018 analysis of the city&#x27;s potential impacts predicted decreased agricultural output and plant growth, and increased water scarcity in the region around the city, interfering with food security and creating income security challenges.

<text>Daniel Keys Moran (born November 30, 1962), also known by his initials DKM, is an American computer programmer and science fiction writer.

==Biography==
Moran was born in Los Angeles to Richard Joseph Moran and Marilynn Joyce Moran. He has three sisters, Kari Lynn Moran, Jodi Anne Moran and Kathleen Moran.

A native of Southern California, he formerly lived (with his former wife Holly Thomas Moran) in North Hollywood. DKM, his third wife Amy Stout-Moran, and their sons Richard Moran and Connor Moran, along with Amy&#x27;s two daughters and one son later lived in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles.

In early 2005 Keys Moran lost vision in one eye due to wet macular degeneration.

==Bibliography==
Moran&#x27;s first story, &quot;All the Time in the World&quot;, appeared in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction&quot; in May 1982. This was incorporated into his first novel, &quot;The Armageddon Blues: A Tale of the Great Wheel of Existence,&quot; which was also the first novel of his projected series &quot;Tales of the Great Wheel of Existence&quot;. A sub-series, &quot;Tales of the Continuing Time&quot;, has been projected to include 32 volumes in its entirety, of which three novels were published in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and a fourth novel, &quot;The A.I. War, Book One: The Big Boost,&quot; in 2011.

<text>Julius Sumner Miller (May 17, 1909 – April 14, 1987) was an American physicist and television personality. He is best known for his work on children&#x27;s television programs in North America and Australia.

==Off-screen==
Julius Sumner Miller was born in Billerica, Massachusetts, as the youngest of nine children. His father was Latvian and his Lithuanian mother spoke 12 languages. He was of Jewish descent.

Miller graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in physics from Boston University in 1933. Due to the Great Depression, he and his wife Alice (née Brown) worked as a butler and maid for a wealthy Boston doctor for the following two years. They had no children, but he reached millions of children through his popular science programs.

In 1937, after submitting over 700 job applications, he was offered a place in the physics department of Dillard University, a private, African American liberal arts college in New Orleans. During World War II he worked as a civilian physicist for the US Army Signal Corps while holding fellowships in physics at the universities of Idaho and Oklahoma. He was a Ford Foundation fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles.

In 1950, Miller won a Carnegie Grant that allowed him to visit Albert Einstein at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, and also to visit the Institute for Advanced Study. He greatly admired Einstein and went on to amass a collection of Einstein memorabilia. In 1952, he joined the physics department at the then small El Camino College in Torrance, California (1952–1974), to maximum student enrollments due to his great popularity and where he was instantly recognizable by his casual hair and horn-rimmed eyeglasses.

Miller was intolerant of misspelled words and misplaced punctuation, and often angered his colleagues because he charged that the students of most faculties were not learning enough. During an interview in the 1940s, he stated that intellectual life in America was in trouble, a belief he held for the rest of his life.

We are approaching a darkness in the land. Boys and girls are emerging from every level of school with certificates and degrees, but they can&#x27;t read, write or calculate. We don&#x27;t have academic honesty or intellectual rigor. Schools have abandoned integrity and rigor.

From 1963 to 1986, Miller was the visiting lecturer for the physics department of the University of Sydney, and from 1965 to 1985 at the United States Air Force Academy.

==Television==
In 1959, Miller began hosting his educational program, &quot;Why Is It So?&quot;, on KNXT (now KCBS-TV) Channel 2 in Los Angeles. From 1962 to 1964, he was Disney&#x27;s &quot;Professor Wonderful&quot; on new introductions, filmed at Disneyland, to the syndicated reruns of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. He also starred in the Disney series &quot;Great Moments in Science&quot; and &quot;Science and its Magic&quot;. During the same period, he appeared on a semi-regular basis, performing physics experiments, on Steve Allen&#x27;s late night TV show in Hollywood, syndicated by Group W. Eventually, he also had his own TV shows in Australia, Canada, Norway, and New Zealand.

Miller&#x27;s first television appearance in Australia was on &quot;Bob Sanders People&quot; in 1963. In an improvised physics demonstration, he attempted to drive a drinking straw through a raw potato. A paper straw normally does not have sufficient strength but if one pinches the end, the trapped air acts as a piston, easily piercing the potato. For the first time in his career he could not get this to work, and he loudly exclaimed &quot;Australian straws ain&#x27;t worth a damn!&quot;. The next morning, Miller arrived at his Sydney University laboratory to find one million drinking straws on the floor with a telegram reading &quot;You might find one of these fitting your requirements&quot;. He later stated &quot;I sat amongst the straws with straws stuck in my hair and ears. But clearly I had made a mistake. I should have said: &#x27;Australian potatoes ain&#x27;t worth a damn&#x27;, and I&#x27;d have cornered the potato market!&quot;

Shortly after, he was offered a job presenting science for Australia&#x27;s ABC Television. When asked how much money he wanted, he replied that he never asked, he listened to an offer then &quot;multiplied it by a factor between two and ten&quot;. Due to budget constraints the offer was withdrawn, but an agreement was reached for Miller to host his own science-based TV series which was filmed at the University of Sydney where he taught. &quot;Why Is It So?&quot; (the program title, which also would become his stock phrase), was broadcast from 1963 to 1986 and became an instant hit known for its &quot;cool experiments, interesting science, and fantastic hair&quot;. The 1960s program became &quot;Demonstrations in Physics&quot; (also called &quot;Science Demonstrations&quot; when it was aired on American PBS television). He introduced each episode with the line:
&quot;How do you do, ladies and gentlemen, and boys and girls&quot; [sometimes adding some others like: &quot;and teachers, and fathers, and mothers, and people&quot;].&lt;br&gt;&quot;I am Julius Sumner Miller, and physics is my business&quot; [whereupon often presenting the subject of each lesson after the characteristical phrase: &quot;And my very special business today is ...&quot;]

Around 1963, Miller was also one of the team of celebrity lecturers in the University of Sydney&#x27;s pioneering &quot;Summer School of Science&quot;, broadcast early in the morning during Australia&#x27;s long summer holidays in January. Fellow presenters included physicist Harry Messel and the molecular biologist James Watson fresh from his triumphant co-discovery of the helical structure of DNA, but decades ahead of his work on the Human Genome.

My first TV series on demonstrations in physics – titled &quot;Why Is It So?&quot; – were now seen and heard over the land. The mail was massive. The academics were a special triumph for me. They charged me with being superficial and trivial. If I had done what they wanted my programs would be as dull as their classes! I knew my purpose well and clear: to show how Nature behaves without cluttering its beauty with abstruse mathematics. Why cloud the charm of a Chladni plate with a Bessel function?

Miller&#x27;s on-air popularity was due to an enthusiasm not normally associated with serious science. Shows would be liberally sprinkled with phrases such as &quot;He who is not stirred by the beauty of it is already dead!&quot; and he also liked to trick the audience. A common ploy would be to hold up an empty glass and ask guests to confirm it was empty...then chide them for not noticing it was full of air. Before each demonstration he would usually ask for a show of hands to indicate which of several results they expected. Often he would then add &quot;hands up those who don&#x27;t care&quot;.

In 1964, Miller suffered a near fatal heart attack. Scheduled to give a lecture in Australia, he sent Sydney University a telegram saying; &quot;I&#x27;ve dropped dead here.&quot; He would suffer a second heart attack in 1986.

In 1966, questions from his show with an answer to the previous day&#x27;s question were published as &quot;Millergrams&quot; in &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper. A selection of 112 of these questions was published as a book &quot;Millergrams; Some Enchanting Questions for Enquiring Minds&quot;. Further books were published in 1967: &quot;The Second Book of Millergrams: Some More Enchanting Questions for Enquiring Minds&quot;, and 1988: &quot;Why is it So?: The Very Best Millergrams of Professor Julius Sumner Miller&quot;.

Sample Millergram:

Q32: A juggler comes to a footbridge of rather flimsy design. He has in hand four balls. The maximum load is no more than the juggler himself and one ball. Can he get across the bridge by juggling the balls, always having at most one ball in the hand (and three in the air)?

A: No. A falling ball exerts a force on the hand greater than its own weight. Rather, a &quot;thrown&quot; ball exerts greater force than a &quot;held&quot; one. That is, the additional force equal and opposite to that imparted to a flung ball, in addition to the juggler&#x27;s mass, would exceed the bridge&#x27;s tolerance (the bridge can tolerate a juggler and held ball, but not the additional downward force associated with forcing a ball &quot;up&quot;).

Miller appeared as &quot;The Professor&quot; in the Canadian series &quot;The Hilarious House of Frightenstein&quot; (1971), in a 4- to 5-minute segment each episode where he demonstrated physics experiments and explained the principles involved.

In 1974 Miller made &quot;The Professor and the Enquiring Minds&quot; in Australia that was shown on the 7 network stations. This consisted of a panel of three school students who were peppered with questions about what they expected to happen in the experiment Miller then conducted, and were then asked to explain the results of the experiment.

In the 1970s, Miller was also an occasional guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in the United States.

==Commercials==
During the 1980s, Miller appeared in a famous series of Australian television commercials for Cadbury chocolate, using his stock phrase &quot;Why is it so?&quot;, demonstrating a simple scientific principle, and describing how each block of chocolate &quot;embraces substantial nourishment and enjoyment&quot;, and contained &quot;a glass and a half of full-cream dairy milk&quot;. The ads were sufficiently popular to be played for some years after his death.

While in Australia, Miller also appeared in ads for non-stick saucepans and Ampol petroleum, which included demonstrations of real principles of physics, albeit briefly.

==Death==
In February 1987, Miller became ill while visiting Australia and returned to the United States where he was diagnosed with leukemia. Miller died six weeks later on April 14, 1987, in Torrance, California. As per his will, Miller&#x27;s body went to the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Dentistry; no services were held at his request.

==Foundations==
Professor Miller&#x27;s wife, Alice Brown Miller, wanted to perpetuate the memory and achievements of her husband, and so conceived the idea of the Julius Sumner Miller Foundation, which was established in 1998.

Through an offer by Cadbury-Schweppes Pty Ltd, the Cadbury-Julius Sumner Miller Scholarship for Academic Excellence was set up to provide undergraduate scholarships in the School of Physics at the University of Sydney.

In 1993, the Australian Science Foundation for Physics established the Julius Sumner Miller Fellowship in his memory. The fellowship is currently held by Karl Kruszelnicki, best known as &quot;Doctor Karl&quot; for his appearances on Australian radio and television as a science commentator and author.

==Popular culture==
In 1966, Miller devised a word game, &quot;Milleranagrams&quot;, which was published in Australia by John Sands Limited. The game, whose only materials were 200 Scrabble-like letter tiles, required players in their turn to draw an unseen tile from the &quot;pool&quot; then either make a word from their stock of tiles or add a tile to a word already on the table (rearrangement of the letters being permitted, hence the name) to form another word.

Miller remains popular in Australia, where he is still quoted. The phrase &quot;As Professor Julius Sumner Miller often asked, &quot;Why is it so?&quot;&quot; and its variations are still often used in newspaper articles that pose questions, even those unrelated to science.

The character Julius in the &quot;Ty the Tasmanian Tiger&quot; series of video games is inspired by Miller, and frequently uses the phrase &quot;Why is this so?&quot;

<doc id="537183" wikidata="Q2654923" url="?curid=537183" title="Complex multiplication">
<text>In mathematics, complex multiplication (CM) is the theory of elliptic curves &quot;E&quot; that have an endomorphism ring larger than the integers. Put another way, it contains the theory of elliptic functions with extra symmetries, such as are visible when the period lattice is the Gaussian integer lattice or Eisenstein integer lattice.

It has an aspect belonging to the theory of special functions, because such elliptic functions, or abelian functions of several complex variables, are then &#x27;very special&#x27; functions satisfying extra identities and taking explicitly calculable special values at particular points. It has also turned out to be a central theme in algebraic number theory, allowing some features of the theory of cyclotomic fields to be carried over to wider areas of application. David Hilbert is said to have remarked that the theory of complex multiplication of elliptic curves was not only the most beautiful part of mathematics but of all science.

There is also the higher-dimensional complex multiplication theory of abelian varieties &quot;A&quot; having &quot;enough&quot; endomorphisms in a certain precise sense, roughly that the action on the tangent space at the identity element of &quot;A&quot; is a direct sum of one-dimensional modules.

==Example of the imaginary quadratic field extension==

Consider an imaginary quadratic field formula_1.
An elliptic function formula_2 is said to have complex multiplication if there is an algebraic relation between formula_3 and formula_4 for all formula_5 in formula_6.

Conversely, Kronecker conjectured – in what became known as the &quot;Kronecker Jugendtraum&quot; – that every abelian extension of formula_6 could be obtained by the (roots of the) equation of a suitable elliptic curve with complex multiplication. To this day this remains one of the few cases of Hilbert&#x27;s twelfth problem which has actually been solved.

An example of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication is

:formula_8

where Z[&quot;i&quot;] is the Gaussian integer ring, and &quot;θ&quot; is any non-zero complex number. Any such complex torus has the Gaussian integers as endomorphism ring. It is known that the corresponding curves can all be written as

:formula_9

for some formula_10, which demonstrably has two conjugate order-4 automorphisms sending

:formula_11

in line with the action of &quot;i&quot; on the Weierstrass elliptic functions.

More generally, consider the lattice Λ, an additive group in the complex plane, generated by formula_12. Then we define the Weierstrass function of the variable formula_13 in formula_14 as follows:
:formula_15
and
:formula_16
:formula_17
Let formula_18 be the derivative of formula_19. Then we obtain an isomorphism of complex Lie groups:
:formula_20
from the complex torus group formula_21 to the projective elliptic curve defined in homogeneous coordinates by
:formula_22
and where the point at infinity, the zero element of the group law of the elliptic curve, is by convention taken to be formula_23. 
If the lattice defining the elliptic curve is actually preserved under multiplication by (possibly a proper subring of) the ring of integers formula_24 of formula_6, then the ring of analytic automorphisms of formula_26 turns out to be isomorphic to this (sub)ring. 

If we rewrite formula_27 where formula_28 and formula_29, then
:formula_30
This means that the j-invariant of formula_31 is an algebraic number – lying in formula_6 – if formula_31 has complex multiplication.

==Abstract theory of endomorphisms==
The ring of endomorphisms of an elliptic curve can be of one of three forms: the integers Z; an order in an imaginary quadratic number field; or an order in a definite quaternion algebra over Q.

When the field of definition is a finite field, there are always non-trivial endomorphisms of an elliptic curve, coming from the Frobenius map, so every such curve has &quot;complex multiplication&quot; (and the terminology is not often applied). But when the base field is a number field, complex multiplication is the exception. It is known that, in a general sense, the case of complex multiplication is the hardest to resolve for the Hodge conjecture.

==Kronecker and abelian extensions==

Kronecker first postulated that the values of elliptic functions at torsion points should be enough to generate all abelian extensions for imaginary quadratic fields, an idea that went back to Eisenstein in some cases, and even to Gauss. This became known as the &quot;Kronecker Jugendtraum&quot;; and was certainly what had prompted Hilbert&#x27;s remark above, since it makes explicit class field theory in the way the roots of unity do for abelian extensions of the rational number field, via Shimura&#x27;s reciprocity law.

Indeed, let &quot;K&quot; be an imaginary quadratic field with class field &quot;H&quot;. Let &quot;E&quot; be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the integers of &quot;K&quot;, defined over &quot;H&quot;. Then the maximal abelian extension of &quot;K&quot; is generated by the &quot;x&quot;-coordinates of the points of finite order on some Weierstrass model for &quot;E&quot; over &quot;H&quot;.

Many generalisations have been sought of Kronecker&#x27;s ideas; they do however lie somewhat obliquely to the main thrust of the Langlands philosophy, and there is no definitive statement currently known.

==Sample consequence==

It is no accident that Ramanujan&#x27;s constant, the transcendental number

: formula_34
or equivalently,

: formula_35

is an almost integer, in that it is very close to an integer. This remarkable fact is explained by the theory of complex multiplication, together with some knowledge of modular forms, and the fact that
: formula_36
is a unique factorization domain.

Here formula_37 satisfies . In general, &quot;S&quot;[&quot;α&quot;] denotes the set of all polynomial expressions in α with coefficients in &quot;S&quot;, which is the smallest ring containing &quot;α&quot; and &quot;S&quot;. Because α satisfies this quadratic equation, the required polynomials can be limited to degree one.

Alternatively,

: formula_38

an internal structure due to certain Eisenstein series, and with similar simple expressions for the other Heegner numbers.

==Singular moduli==
The points of the upper half-plane &quot;τ&quot; which correspond to the period ratios of elliptic curves over the complex numbers with complex multiplication are precisely the imaginary quadratic numbers. The corresponding modular invariants &quot;j&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;) are the singular moduli, coming from an older terminology in which &quot;singular&quot; referred to the property of having non-trivial endomorphisms rather than referring to a singular curve.

The modular function &quot;j&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;) is algebraic on imaginary quadratic numbers &quot;τ&quot;: these are the only algebraic numbers in the upper half-plane for which &quot;j&quot; is algebraic.

If Λ is a lattice with period ratio &quot;τ&quot; then we write &quot;j&quot;(Λ) for &quot;j&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;). If further Λ is an ideal a in the ring of integers &quot;OK&quot; of a quadratic imaginary field &quot;K&quot; then we write &quot;j&quot;(a) for the corresponding singular modulus. The values &quot;j&quot;(a) are then real algebraic integers, and generate the Hilbert class field &quot;H&quot; of &quot;K&quot;: the field extension degree [&quot;H&quot;:&quot;K&quot;] = &quot;h&quot; is the class number of &quot;K&quot; and the &quot;H&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a Galois extension with Galois group isomorphic to the ideal class group of &quot;K&quot;. The class group acts on the values &quot;j&quot;(a) by [b] : &quot;j&quot;(a) → &quot;j&quot;(ab).

In particular, if &quot;K&quot; has class number one, then &quot;j&quot;(a) = &quot;j&quot;(&quot;O&quot;) is a rational integer: for example, &quot;j&quot;(Z[i]) = &quot;j&quot;(i) = 1728.

<text>Democratic Labour was a minor political party operating in the United Kingdom in the 1970s. It was formed by the Labour MP Dick Taverne when his Constituency Labour Party (CLP) in the Lincoln constituency deselected him as its candidate at the next general election. He had fallen out with it over Britain&#x27;s proposed membership of the European Communities, which he supported but it did not.

Taverne resigned from Labour on 6 October 1972, forming the Lincoln Democratic Labour Association, which his supporters in the CLP joined. His initial intention was to eventually rejoin the Labour Party, but some others attempted to persuade him to try to establish a new party of the political centre.

Taverne resigned from parliament at the same time that he resigned from the Labour Party in order to force the issue into the open, and he won the ensuing Lincoln by-election, held in March 1973.

His victory was aided by the controversial adoption of Jonathan Guinness by the Conservatives, and by the lack of a Liberal Party candidate, for the Liberal Party decided to support Taverne&#x27;s candidacy.

Shortly after his by-election victory, Taverne formed the Campaign for Social Democracy as a national body. He was re-elected in the February 1974 general election, and continued to serve until the October 1974 general election when he was defeated, Harold Wilson having demanded the Labour Party &quot;throw the kitchen sink&quot; at Lincoln in its efforts to displace him. Taverne did not stand in the seat again, but Democratic Labour continued to organise politically, to the extent that Democratic Labour controlled Lincoln City Council from 1973 until 1979 and across England during the 1973 local elections Democratic Labour candidates achieved some success.

At the 1979 general election, Democratic Labour contested two constituencies: Lincoln, and Brigg and Scunthorpe. Taverne advised against nominating any candidates, but campaigned for them anyway. Both were unsuccessful in their attempts to gain seats in the House of Commons, losing their deposits (at that time 12.5% of the vote was required in order to retain deposits; this was reduced to 5% after the 1983 general election). However, both seats were narrowly gained from the incumbent Labour MPs by the Conservative Party&#x27;s candidates, with the Conservative majority over Labour being less than the Democratic Labour vote. In an analysis of the voting in the election, Ivor Crewe, Director of the British Election Study, stated that the Democratic Labour candidates &quot;splintered enough of the Labour vote ... to allow the Conservatives to gain both seats&quot;.

In 1980, Democratic Labour merged with the Social Democratic Alliance. A social club that the groups had established ran until 1987.

In many ways, Democratic Labour can be seen as a forerunner of the Social Democratic Party, which broke away from Labour in the early 1980s, putting forward many of the same viewpoints as Taverne. He twice stood as a SDP candidate but failed to be elected.

<text>Michael Garibaldi is a lead fictional character in the universe of the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, played by Jerry Doyle.

==Character history==
===Overview===
During most of &quot;Babylon 5&#x27;s&quot; five seasons, Garibaldi is the Chief of Security on board the space station Babylon 5. He holds the rank of Chief Warrant Officer. During the fourth season he suddenly resigned as Security Chief; he then begins working for Edgars Industries on Mars, one of the largest corporations on the planet. During the fifth and final season of Babylon 5 he was the Director of Covert Intelligence, a post similar to the present-day CIA Director, for the new Interstellar Alliance. Although friendly with the other crew members, he is very much his own man.

This independence leads him into great danger numerous times during the series. Like most of the characters on the series, Garibaldi is a complex person. On the positive side he is loyal, trustworthy, brave, shrewd, thorough in his job duties, and a tough and skilled soldier with small arms, in hand-to-hand combat, or in the cockpit of a Starfury fighter. He possesses a lively sense of humor, enjoys watching old twentieth-century cartoons such as &quot;Daffy Duck&quot; (&quot;Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century&quot;) who is referred to as a &quot;household god of frustration&quot; for Garibaldi in a conversation between Zack Allan and G&#x27;Kar, loves twentieth-century motorcycles, and generally has an easygoing, laid-back personality when he&#x27;s not on duty.

However, he can also (ironically, given his suspicious nature) be too trusting of close friends and aides, and his tendency towards alcoholism and self-destructive behavior is a constant struggle for him throughout the series. Of the major characters on Babylon 5 Garibaldi is in many ways the most &quot;down-to-earth&quot; and &quot;ordinary&quot;; he often sides with the working-class humans on the station and in turn is considered by them to be a kindred spirit. He loves Italian food and often cuts secret deals with Babylon 5 dockworkers to bring expensive Italian foods onto the station. The deals are secret because of the disapproval of Dr. Stephen Franklin, B5&#x27;s medical chief and a close friend of Garibaldi. Dr. Franklin disapproves of Garibaldi&#x27;s love of fatty foods, although on at least one occasion he agrees to eat an Italian meal (bagna càuda) cooked by Garibaldi.

===Early life and career===
Michael Alfredo Garibaldi was born in the Bronx, New York, Earth. He was the son of Alfredo Garibaldi, who was an EarthForce infantryman, who retired at the rank of sergeant-major. Garibaldi was raised in the Catholic church; he would later say he was &quot;raised a good Catholic boy&quot;. Later in life he became an agnostic but always maintained respect for the church. His grandmother was a Boston cop. Garibaldi inherited her Smith &amp; Wesson .38 Special police revolver.

Garibaldi was an honest man. This honesty, and his refusal to &quot;play along&quot; with policies and actions he knew were illegal, got him into difficulties with corrupt officials on more than one occasion. During one incident, a landing pad had been rigged to explode; when it did, a close friend of Garibaldi&#x27;s died. His friend&#x27;s daughter blamed him for many years, and Garibaldi retreated into alcoholism.

During the bloody Earth–Minbari War Garibaldi was an infantryman (called &quot;groundpounder&quot; or &quot;gropo&quot;) in EarthForce. He participated in a number of ground battles against the Minbari and managed to survive the war, a considerable accomplishment. However, his experiences led to a certain amount of distrust and dislike of pompous high-ranking officers, a fact which often got him into trouble with his superiors. However, his naturally suspicious and rebellious nature made him an excellent investigator and security officer. His alcoholism may also have been a coping mechanism stemming from some form of PTSD that he acquired during the war. Because of his bouts with alcohol &amp; PTSD, he&#x27;s often seen as a sympathetic character to fellow veterans of the war, giving them wide latitude when they commit minor infractions on his watch as B5 Chief of Security.

Garibaldi continued to have problems with alcoholism for a number of years, which got him fired from several jobs. Eventually he was able to bring his alcoholism under control. While piloting Jeffrey Sinclair over the surface of Mars, their shuttle malfunctioned and crashed. Garibaldi and Sinclair then had to trek across the planet&#x27;s surface for several days in order to make it back to civilization, during the trek the two men became friends.

While on Mars, he also began a romantic relationship with Lise Hampton. She eventually broke up with him due to his repeated bouts of alcoholism and difficulties in keeping a job. However, she genuinely loved him and they continued to maintain a relationship on an &quot;off and on&quot; basis for nearly 15 years.

===Babylon 5===
====First 3 seasons====
When Sinclair was picked to command Babylon 5, he asked Garibaldi to serve as chief of security. Lise refused to go with Garibaldi, and the two broke up at that point. Lise later was briefly married and had a daughter, but when she divorced her husband, Earth Alliance judges biased towards Earth natives took her daughter away from her in a trial.

Garibaldi became an excellent chief of security over the next few years. He managed to keep his alcoholism under control (he is often seen refusing free liquor and drinking water instead), and became well-liked and respected by the security forces that he commanded. As Security Chief he made it his duty to know every nook and corner of the station where criminals could possibly hide and operate, and he also worked hard to know and keep track of every leader and member of human and alien organized-crime groups on the station. His presence alone was often enough to intimidate would-be criminals and evildoers from carrying out their plans, or to confessing to their crimes.

During Garibaldi&#x27;s second year, he discovered a plot to assassinate Earth Alliance President Luis Santiago. When he confronted the plotters on the station, Garibaldi was shot in the back by his second-in-command, whom he had implicitly trusted and trained. Even though he managed to let Commander Sinclair know about the assassination plot, the news came too late as EarthForce One, the President&#x27;s starship, soon exploded, with the President on board.

For the next several weeks Garibaldi was in a coma and near death, despite Dr. Stephen Franklin&#x27;s best efforts. Franklin explained that he felt that a person in such circumstances could come to a point where they&#x27;d lose the will to live, and the body would then stop cooperating. Franklin felt that the debate was going on somewhere inside Garibaldi&#x27;s mind.

Franklin eventually decided to try an alien healing device, which he had confiscated from its previous owner, on Garibaldi. Both he and John Sheridan donated life energy, which the machine transferred to Garibaldi. Once this was done, Garibaldi eventually emerged from his coma. Garibaldi discovered that Sinclair was gone, and that Sheridan was the new commanding officer. Telepath Talia Winters was able to help him discover who had attacked him. With this information, Garibaldi&#x27;s former aide was arrested. The new president, Morgan Clark, recalled the aide back to Earth, but the aide disappeared en route. Although Garibaldi was suspicious of Sheridan at first, he eventually came to trust him.

Garibaldi struggled with the decision whether to return to his job or not. He felt that being shot in the back said something about the type of security officer he was, but Garibaldi eventually decided to return. For the next two years, Garibaldi continued to serve as chief of security. He became good friends with Sheridan. When President Clark began turning the Earth Alliance into a dictatorship, and with the reemergence of the Shadows, Garibaldi became the liaison between Babylon 5 and the Anla&#x27;Shok, or Rangers, upon receiving a message from Sinclair, who had since become the leader of the organization upon being posted to Minbar, a side duty that was known to the Rangers and a select few Sinclair felt he could trust, including Garibaldi.

When Nightwatch, a sinister police force created by President Clark to expose and arrest &quot;traitors to Earth&quot;, began to infiltrate station security, Garibaldi refused to cooperate with them. Garibaldi eventually helped to locate, identify, and capture the members of Nightwatch on the station. He then oversaw a security force that included Narn replacements. When Sheridan withdrew Babylon 5 from the increasingly fascist Earth Alliance in the episode &quot;Severed Dreams&quot;, the station was soon attacked by a fleet of EarthForce warships loyal to President Clark. During the battle a force of Earth Marines boarded and attempted to take over the station. Garibaldi led the station&#x27;s security forces in a defence of the station, after a bitter and bloody fight the invading marines were defeated and forced to surrender. Initially, Garibaldi was shown to have broken his leg during the fight. But when the actor Jerry Doyle broke his arm during filming, in the next episode he was shown wearing a sling - Garibaldi explained this as that he fractured his wrist and forearm during the fight, but had initially not thought it bad enough to let Dr. Franklin put it in a cast.

====Season 4====
When the year came to the end, Sheridan went to Z&#x27;ha&#x27;dum. A Shadow attack force arrived at the station. Garibaldi went out in a fighter to protect the station. When Sheridan detonated the White Star - which had two fusion bombs on it - over the Shadow capital city, the force withdrew. Garibaldi was taken on board a Shadow vessel.

The Shadows used Psi-Corps personnel to reprogram humans. Alfred Bester diverted Garibaldi&#x27;s transport to a Psi-Corps facility of his choosing, and spent the next two weeks carefully reprogramming him to uncover a conspiracy against the telepaths. After ensuring he remembered nothing, he was released unconscious onto an empty ship near Babylon 5. At about the same time, a revived Sheridan came back to Babylon 5.

During the buildup for the final attack on the Shadows, Garibaldi&#x27;s mood changed. While he returned to duty as security chief, Garibaldi no longer had any enthusiasm for the job. Zack Allan thought that he had just been through a lot and he would recover sooner or later.

After the Shadow War was over, Garibaldi received a coded message that activated his programming. He resigned from his job as chief of security to work as an independent investigator over the next several months, helping people find what they had lost in the war. He increasingly came into conflict with Babylon 5 staff, violently confronting Sheridan on two occasions. Garibaldi rationalized his hostility towards Sheridan as a concern that he was developing a cult of personality around him and saw himself as the second coming.

He was recruited by William Edgars&#x27; anti-Sheridan right-hand-man, known only as Wade, to work for the mega-corporation Edgars Industries. Garibaldi gained some initial trust in the organization by smuggling several valuable items destined for Mars through Babylon 5 customs. It was then that he learned that Lise had married William Edgars. Garibaldi demanded a face-to-face meeting on Mars with Edgars himself, wanting to know what he was involved in. When President Clark began attacking civilian targets, Sheridan declared his intent to remove Clark by any means necessary. Edgars agreed to bring Garibaldi into the inner circle if he arranged Sheridan&#x27;s capture. Knowing Sheridan&#x27;s weaknesses, Garibaldi provided medical details that allowed Sheridan&#x27;s fugitive father to be captured. He then contacted Sheridan to offer help in rescuing his father, provided that he came to Mars alone. Still having some trust in Garibaldi, Sheridan fell into the trap. With Sheridan captured, Edgars informed him of the plot to release a virus contagious to human telepaths only. Psi-Corps agents moved in swiftly.

At this point, Bester came to Garibaldi and released him from his conditioning. Bester had only needed to adjust Garibaldi&#x27;s personality subtly, increasing his natural suspicion and mistrust of authority. Bester admitted that some of Garibaldi&#x27;s actions, such as quitting his post as head of security for Babylon 5, had surprised him.

Garibaldi, captured by the Martian resistance movement, was only able to avoid execution with Lyta Alexander&#x27;s help. He helped Dr. Franklin and Lyta free Sheridan, and got him safely back to the fleet. Sheridan then took command of the EAS Agamemnon, and set the fleet on course for Mars.

Garibaldi remained behind on Mars. He helped take control of a bunker at the Earth Alliance base. From there, Lyta Alexander was able to activate the weaponized telepaths that had been smuggled on to the Earth Force ships.

After the battle of Earth was over, Garibaldi went looking for Lise. With the help of several Rangers, he was able to rescue Lise from the Martian Mafia. He then stayed with Lise for several days. At that point, with the consent of Lise, Garibaldi decided to return to Babylon 5 for one year to help Sheridan in the founding years of the Interstellar Alliance.

====Season 5====
=====Head of Covert Intelligence=====
Garibaldi arrived at Babylon 5 shortly before Sheridan and Delenn returned. With the help of Dr. Franklin, he arranged a party for Sheridan, even though Sheridan had told him he didn&#x27;t want that.

Soon new Babylon 5 commander Capt. Elizabeth Lochley arrived. Garibaldi helped with security for Sheridan&#x27;s inauguration. Despite threats to his life, Sheridan decided to go ahead with the ceremony, and Lochley agreed. Garibaldi followed her out of the President&#x27;s office, and angrily confronted her about her decision. Lochley told him that, as he wasn&#x27;t actually part of the Alliance or Babylon 5 staff, his opinions didn&#x27;t count for too much. Garibaldi found the assassin and killed him before he could kill the President. After that, Garibaldi spoke to Sheridan about what Lochley had said, at which point Sheridan made him the Head of Covert Intelligence for the Alliance.

Garibaldi initially recruited several rogue telepaths to assist in intelligence gathering operations. This was followed by finding out that part of the Centauri government were behind attacks on ships.

When Bester arrived on Babylon 5, Garibaldi tried to take his revenge against him. He first stormed in on a meeting between Lochley and Bester. Lochley had him arrested. Even though Sheridan angrily confronted her later about it, she stood by her decision. During a later visit, Garibaldi walked into Bester&#x27;s quarters with a phased plasma gun, intending to shoot him, but discovered that Bester had done some further programming. Bester described it as &quot;hitting him with an Asimov&quot;—Garibaldi could &quot;want&quot; to kill Bester all he wanted, but he could not &quot;actually&quot; kill Bester, or through inaction allow Bester to come to harm, similar to Asimov&#x27;s first law of robotics.

Shortly after this, Garibaldi began drinking again. He had done this in order to gain a sense of control over his life once again. However, the drinking would have serious consequences, not only for Garibaldi, but for many others as well. It resulted in the death of a pilot who had information on the Centauri attacks. Garibaldi&#x27;s performance began to decline. Lise arrived on the station and found out about his drinking. Even though she tried to help him, Garibaldi didn&#x27;t stop.

Eventually, Sheridan found out. While initially angry at Garibaldi, Sheridan was calmed down by Delenn. Sheridan was disappointed that Garibaldi didn&#x27;t feel that he could go to Sheridan with his problems. When Garibaldi told Sheridan that he had been drinking for a couple months, Sheridan said that is about what he had suspected, but had tried to deny what was going on. With no other choice, Sheridan suspended Garibaldi.

Lochley also confronted him. When Garibaldi told her she didn&#x27;t understand what he was going through, she revealed that she did. Not only did her father have alcoholism, but she had been addicted herself to a variety of drugs during her teen years. Lochley got Lise to return to Babylon 5 to help support Garibaldi.

When Lise returned, Garibaldi decided that the time had come for him to leave. Lise wanted him to help run Edgars Industries, and to give him a good life. He suddenly realized that he had a way to solve two major problems. Using his influence, he got Lyta Alexander released from jail and offered to funnel money and resources to her to finance her fight against the Psi-Corps. In return, she would remove Bester&#x27;s programming, so that Garibaldi could try to &quot;nail that sucker&#x27;s head against the wall&quot;. She agreed to do that in two years if he was able to get her the funds. He also found out that the entire board of Edgars Industries was trying to have him and Lise assassinated.

Garibaldi soon married Lise. He then took over the day-to-day operations of the company. With the new Head of Covert Intelligence Tessa Holloran - the former Number One of the Mars resistance - Garibaldi was able to find out all sorts of useful information about the board. He not only fired the entire board, but he told them if any board member had either him or his wife killed, there was money set aside for bounty hunters to take them all out. He told them to leave the cigars.

Soon, Garibaldi and Lise left for Mars. He told Sheridan and Delenn that he had never expected to live that long—he had been sure for a long time that his tenure on Babylon 5 would end with him face down somewhere in Brown Sector.

===Head of Edgars Industries===
Upon arriving on Mars, Garibaldi began shaking up the company. He found a certain few of the troublemakers, and made them all new members of the board. Garibaldi told them that he wanted to know if he was making a mistake, and that they needed to stand their ground with him. If they were right, they&#x27;d get a bonus. If not, he told them, he&#x27;d have them for lunch.

In the following months, Garibaldi began a review of Edgars Industries. He retained all the worthwhile projects and exposed the company&#x27;s black projects.

While no longer an official with the Interstellar Alliance, Garibaldi remained friendly with Sheridan and the others, and would assist them on numerous occasions. Several years later, he helped build the new Victory-class destroyer vessels. While there had been a great deal of problems integrating Earth and Minbari technology, two vessels were built, the prototypes Victory and Excalibur. While the Victory was destroyed in the Drakh attack on Earth, the Excalibur was able to help find the cure for the disease the Drakh spread on Earth.

In three novels - the last book of the Psi Corp trilogy, and the last two books of the Centauri Prime trilogy - the authors explored the period between the end of &quot;Babylon 5&quot; and Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; in 2281. These novels are canon and give an interesting glimpse into Garibaldi&#x27;s future. In one book, Garibaldi is able to track down Bester. While he isn&#x27;t able to bring himself to kill him, he does help bring him to justice. Bester spends the rest of his life in prison, with his abilities suppressed by drugs. In the other books, Garibaldi is instrumental in gathering intelligence on Centauri Prime and uncovering the machinations of the Centauri government. Later, he is able to help find the Drakh Shiv&#x27;kala after their withdrawal from Centauri Prime. As a result, Vir is able to kill Shiv&#x27;kala, and release Sheridan&#x27;s son David from the Drakh keeper.

Garibaldi and his wife eventually have a daughter named Mary. By 2281, she is about 14 years old.

When Sheridan realizes that he has very little time left, he sends invitations to all his friends to come to Minbar for one last party. The invitation arrives while Dr. Franklin is visiting Garibaldi. Despite his differences with Sheridan over the years, Garibaldi says that Sheridan is his friend, and decides to go to Minbar. They share one last meal. After Sheridan is taken from the galaxy by Lorien, Garibaldi makes one last trip to Babylon 5, for the shutdown ceremony, and takes a piece of the station—a shot glass bearing the station&#x27;s logo—with him before leaving for the last time.

After the episode &quot;Sleeping in Light&quot; Garibaldi returns to his family on Mars. When arriving home, he finds that his daughter had won a tennis match. Garibaldi&#x27;s life after Sheridan&#x27;s departure is mostly quiet. Series creator J. Michael Straczynski says that his ultimate fate would be much quieter than Garibaldi could have imagined.

===Legacy===
500 years after the events in the television series, Garibaldi and all the main players in that story are long dead. However, Daniel, a member of an Orwellian faction seeking to sever Earth from the Interstellar Alliance in the face of a looming civil war, brings back holographic recreations of Garibaldi, Sheridan, Delenn, and Franklin. He begins reprogramming the recreations to re-enact distorted and propagandized versions of historical events so that he can convince others that the Interstellar Alliance is (and always has been) evil. Daniel explains this to the confused recreations; though they are outraged, they are unable to stop themselves from re-enacting the events as Daniel directs.

While the simulations are being re-enacted Garibaldi&#x27;s recreation discovers that it possesses most of the real Michael Garibaldi&#x27;s knowledge and skills, including his knowledge of computer systems. Using these skills the recreation is able to hack into the rebel alliance&#x27;s main computer network, finding plans detailing an impending surprise attack on the main Earth government, which he promptly sends to Earth authorities. During a break between recordings the Garibaldi recreation reveals what he&#x27;s done to Daniel, just seconds before the government launches a preemptive attack on the rebel facilities. The holographic studio is destroyed shortly thereafter, prematurely starting a civil war but denying Daniel&#x27;s organization the potentially catastrophic propaganda material they sought.

==Naming==
He is named after the Italian patriot Giuseppe Garibaldi.

==Current status==
As Jerry Doyle died in July 2016, the Michael Garibaldi character will not make any further appearances in any future Babylon 5 movies or television series. His character nonetheless lives on with an extensive further history after the end of the Babylon 5 TV series proper in the novels. His appearance in the finale Sleeping In Light is the last canonically.

== Analysis ==
Christina Francis looked at the pararells between Babylon 5 story and the Arthurian myth. She described Garibaldi as a &quot;complicated character&quot; comparing him to Arthurian Sir Kay.

Garibaldi&#x27;s flaw of being a recovering alcoholic has been described as being quite personal for the actor who played him, who shared similar history in his real life.

<text>Cricket is the most popular sport in India. It is played almost everywhere in the country. The Board of Control for Cricket in India is the governing body of Indian cricket and conduct all domestic tournaments and select the players for India national cricket team and India women&#x27;s national cricket team.

Domestic competitions in India annually organized by BCCI include the Ranji Trophy, the Duleep Trophy, the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the Deodhar Trophy, the Irani Trophy and the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy. The Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 tournament where various city-based franchises compete in a style similar to American football, is one of the biggest sporting leagues and the biggest cricketing league in the world. In 2023 it launched a similar league for females, the Women&#x27;s Premier League (WPL)

International cricket in India does not follow a consistent pattern, unlike other cricketing teams such as England, who tour other countries during the winter and play at home during the summer. The Indian cricket team is one of the most successful cricket teams in the world, having won 2 ICC World Cups, 2 ICC World Twenty20, 2 ICC Champion&#x27;s Trophies and finished runners up in 2 ICC World Test Championships. The 2021 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup, was initially meant to be hosted by India. However, after the escalation of the COVID-19 Pandemic in India, the tournament was moved by the ICC to the United Arab Emirates. The 2023 Cricket World Cup was hosted by India.

Cricket is an important part of Indian culture and top players, like Sunil Manohar Gavaskar, Mohinder Amarnath, Kapil Dev, Bishan Singh Bedi, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Virender Sehwag, Lala Amarnath, Polly Umrigar, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli often attain celebrity status and are some of the most influential figures in the country. Cricket is often portrayed patriotically in popular Indian films, including the Academy Award-nominated film, &quot;Lagaan&quot;, and &quot;83&quot;, the 2021 sports drama film about India&#x27;s Cricket World Cup victory in 1983. The Indian cricket team shares a long-standing rivalry with the Pakistani cricket team, and India-Pakistan matches are some of the most anticipated matches in the world, and one of the most watched television broadcasts in the world. It was only in 1983 when India defeated the West Indies that made the sport become popular.

== History ==
Cricket was brought to India in the early 1700s, with the first documented insurance of cricket being played in 1721. At the time of its introduction, it was used as a medium for Indians to integrate into British cultural norms. By serving as a bridge between the two groups, it made assimilating much easier. In its early time in India, it was played and used by Indian elites to gain favour with the British which not only aided in the value of the sport due to its association with the elite but its high status helped it spread throughout India. Although it began as a foreign sport, the sport ultimately became associated with India and began to play a role in India&#x27;s identity. In the late 1800s, cricket&#x27;s image began to move away from being an exclusively upper class sport as players from lower castes and underprivileged communities began to play and make their mark.

=== 1800s to 1918 ===
The first ever match of first-class cricket played in India was in 1864 between Calcutta and Madras. Not many records exist from the match. The entire history of cricket in India and the sub-continent as a whole is based on the existence and development of the British Raj via the East India Company.

=== 1918 to 1945 ===

India became the sixth national team to play Test cricket on their 1932 tour of England. Captained by C. K. Nayudu, their inaugural Test was against England at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground from 25 to 28 June, but they were defeated by 158 runs.

=== 1945 to 1960 ===
The major and defining event in the history of Indian cricket during this period was the Partition of India following full independence from the British Raj in 1947.

An early casualty of change was the Bombay Quadrangular tournament, which had been a focal point of Indian cricket for over 50 years. The new India had no place for teams based on ethnic origin. As a result, the Ranji Trophy came into its own as the national championship. The last Bombay Pentangular, as it had become, was won by the Hindus in 1945–46.

India also recorded its first Test victory in 1952, beating England by an innings in Madras.

=== 1960 to 1970 ===

One team totally dominated Indian cricket in the 1960s. As part of 14 consecutive victories in the Ranji Trophy from 1958–59 to 1972–73, Bombay won the title in all ten seasons of the period under review. Among its players were Farokh Engineer, Dilip Sardesai, Bapu Nadkarni, Ramakant Desai, Baloo Gupte, Ashok Mankad and Ajit Wadekar. In the 1961–1962 season, the Duleep Trophy was inaugurated as a zonal competition. It was named after Ranji&#x27;s nephew, Kumar Shri Duleepsinhji (1905–59). With Bombay in its catchment, it is not surprising that the West Zone won six of the first nine titles.

=== 1970 to 1985 ===

Bombay continued to dominate Indian domestic cricket, with only Karnataka, Delhi, and a few other teams able to mount any kind of challenge during this period.

India enjoyed two international highlights. In 1971, they won a Test series in England for the first time ever, surprisingly defeating Ray Illingworth&#x27;s Ashes winners. In 1983, again in England, India were surprise winners of the 1983 Cricket World Cup under the captaincy of Kapil Dev. Kapil Dev was also most known for the Viv Richards Catch, and him scoring 175 not out, being the first Indian to score an ODI Century, and also broke the World Record of Glenn Turner&#x27;s 171. 183 is the lowest score ever defended in a world cup final, and India has done the unthinkable!

During the 1970s, the Indian cricket team began to see success overseas beating New Zealand, and holding Australia, South Africa and England to a draw. The backbone of the team was the Indian spin quartet – Bishen Bedi, E. A. S. Prasanna, B. S. Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkataraghavan, giving rise to what would later be called the Golden Era of Indian cricket history. This decade also saw the emergence of two of India&#x27;s best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Vishwanath responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of Ajit Wadekar.

The Indian women&#x27;s team made its test debut in 1976, becoming the third nation to do so. It made its ODI debut on 1 January 1978.

=== 1985 to 2000 ===
In the late 1980s, continuous live coverage of overseas matches was broadcast by British networks. This was a major factor in shaping what was now becoming the modern game of cricket. Modern technology and the establishment of specialized television networks set a global interest for the sport. ESPN and Star Sports added cricket to part of the 24 hours of continuous live coverage that they were needed to produce. Global popularity increased among the Eastern world. Soon after a domestic league (the Indian Premier League) was established.

Several team names and spellings were altered during the 1990s when traditional Indian names were introduced to replace those that were associated with the British Raj. Most notably, Bombay became Mumbai, and the venue of Calcutta became Kolkata, both where the main places where the British did all their business&quot;.&quot;

During the 1980s, India developed a more attack-focused batting line-up with talented batsmen such as Mohammad Azharuddin, Dilip Vengsarkar and Ravi Shastri prominent during this decade. Despite India&#x27;s victory in the Cricket World Cup in 1983, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. However, India won the Asia Cup in 1984 and won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia in 1985. The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan – the first time it was played outside England.

From the 1993–94 season, the Duleep Trophy was converted from a knockout competition to a league format.

Several team names and spellings were altered during the 1990s when traditional Indian names were introduced to replace those that were associated with the British Raj. Most notably, Bombay became Mumbai and the famous venue of Madras became Chennai.

Despite its arrival in the 1700s, cricket&#x27;s popularity soared gradually as it spread across regions. It became a unifying factor in the country, transcending social and cultural barriers. The sport was initially popular amongst the elite, but it began to transcend as people from lower castes would come together to play, watch, and engage with the sport. Post-independence, cricket continued to flourish and became an integral part of the nation&#x27;s fabric, particularly in their rivalries, the most prevalent one being India v Pakistan. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) emerged as a pivotal force, steering the sport toward globalization. In addition, technology played a crucial role as it increased accessibility by bringing live cricket matches into homes which amplified its reach and its impact.

The pivotal moment in cricket&#x27;s globalization in India came with success on the international stage. Victories in major tournaments aided in globalization, but the tipping points occurred in the iconic 1983 Cricket World Cup win which not only captivated the nation but the world. Even the most optimistic of fans believed the furthest India could go was the semi-finals, so when India reached the finals, audiences were captivated. This match was led by now legend, Kapil Dev in addition to Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar who were highly revered throughout India which aided in the increased popularity and globalization of cricket. Because these legends were not upper class elites, they emerged as cultural icons who represented the dreams and aspirations of millions in addition to the increased sense of pride they evoked. Their success on the global stage in a post-colonial India resonated deeply with India as it evoked pride and honor which many had not felt in a long time.

In addition to the increased sense of nationalism which aided in its globalization, cricket mirrored the changing socio-political landscape of India. By shifting a once elite sport into something accessible to the masses, the sport echoed societal transformations with the rise of the middle class. Cricket became a vessel for social mobility and offered opportunities and hope to people across India regardless of their religion, caste, or social standing. 
With the increased popularity of the sport in India, especially in the 1980s, international satellite television networks latched onto cricket because of its global audience and the newly emerged market of viewers in India. In order to secure their place, these networks worked out broadcasting deals with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) which gave the BCCI an immense amount of wealth which further aided in the globalization of cricket.

In addition to its spread through television, its globalization has a direct link to India&#x27;s increase in consumerism. As the sport became increasingly popular in India in the 80&#x27;s into the 90s, India experienced a rapid expansion of both televised and billboard advertising. As a result, it became common for various teams and individual cricket players to promote various consumer goods which aided in its globalization.

=== 21st century ===

Sachin Tendulkar was one of the key members during 1989–2013 for Team India in multiple formats.

Since 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements with the appointment of John Wright, India&#x27;s first ever foreign coach. This appointment met success internationally as India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001 and won the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007. India was also the first sub-continental team to win at the WACA in January 2008 against Australia.

India&#x27;s victory against the Australians in 2001 marked the beginning of a dream era for the team under the captainship of Sourav Ganguly, winning Test matches in Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. India also shared a joint victory with Sri Lanka in the ICC Champions Trophy and went on to the finals in the 2003 Cricket World Cup only to be beaten by Australia.

In September 2007, India won the first ever Twenty20 World Cup held in South Africa, beating their arch-rivals Pakistan by 5 runs in a thrilling final.

India won the Cricket World Cup in 2011 under the captainship of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the first time since 1983 (28 years) – they beat Sri Lanka in the final held in Mumbai&#x27;s Wankhede Stadium.

India played its 500th Test match against New Zealand led by Kane Williamson at Kanpur from 22 to 26 September 2016. India won this match by 197 runs. This test was played under the captaincy of Virat Kohli.

==Administration==

It is a consortium of state cricket associations that select their own representatives who elect the BCCI president. It joined the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1926 which later became the International Cricket Council.The BCCI is an autonomous, private organization that does not fall under the purview of the National Sports Federation of India of Government of India and does not receive any grants from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The BCCI is influential in international cricket. The International Cricket Council shares the largest part of its revenue with the BCCI.

Women&#x27;s cricket arrived in India much later; the Women&#x27;s Cricket Association of India (WCAI) was formed in 1973. The Indian women&#x27;s team played their first Test match in 1976, against the West Indies. India recorded its first-ever Test win in November 1978 against West Indies under Shantha Rangaswamy&#x27;s captaincy at the Moin-ul-Haq Stadium in Patna.

The WCAI, the governing body for women&#x27;s cricket, was affiliated to the International Women&#x27;s Cricket Council.

== Organisation of cricket in modern India ==

===International cricket===

International cricket in India generally does not follow a fixed pattern. For example, the English schedule under which the nation tours other countries during the winter and plays at home during the summer. Generally, there has recently been a tendency to play more one-day matches than Test matches. Cricket in India is managed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the richest cricket board in the cricket world.

==== Men&#x27;s National Team ====
The India National Cricket Team represents India in international cricket matches.

India have been participating in international cricket since 1926 and competed in international tournament since the first ever the 1975 Cricket World Cup. They have competed in numerous tournaments over the years including the ACC tournaments. The Indian national cricket team has also provided some of the greatest players to the world, the biggest example of which is Sachin Tendulkar. Indian cricket has a rich history. The Indian men&#x27;s national team is currently ranked No. 1 in Tests, No. 1 in ODIs and at 1st position in T20Is. India won two World Championship cups in 1983 under the captaincy of Kapil Dev and recently won in the year 2011 under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, which was won after a span of 28 years. They also won the World Championship of Cricket in 1985.

*Test International- India was invited to the International Cricket Council in 1926, and made their debut as a Test playing nation in England in 1932, led by CK Nayudu, who was considered the best Indian batsman at the time. The one-off Test match between the two sides was played at Lord&#x27;s in London. The team was not strong in their batting at this point and went on to lose by 158 runs. India hosted its first men&#x27;s Test cricket series in 1933. England was the visiting team that played two Tests in Bombay (now Mumbai) and Calcutta (now Kolkata). The visitors won the series 2–0. The Indian team continued to improve throughout the 1930s and 1940s but did not achieve an international victory during this period. In the early 1940s, India did not play any men&#x27;s Test cricket due to World War II. The team&#x27;s first series as an independent country was in late 1947 against Don Bradman&#x27;s Australian cricket team in England in 1948 (a name given to the Australia national cricket team of that time). It was also the first Test series India played which was not against England. Australia men&#x27;s cricket team won the five-match series 4–0, with Bradman tormenting the Indian bowling in his final Australian summer.
*One Day International- The advent of men&#x27;s One Day International (ODI) cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world. However, India was not considered strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defensive approach to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup. Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975; India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs. In contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and was particularly strong at home, where their combination of stylish batsmen and beguiling spinners were at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976, when they chased 403 to win, thanks to 112 from Viswanath. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without any individual batsman scoring a century. This innings was only the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures. During the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy Mohammad Azharuddin, Dilip Vengsarkar and all-rounders Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri. India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and the two-time defending champions West Indies in the final at Lord&#x27;s, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the Asia Cup and in 1985, won the World Championship of Cricket in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the Indian subcontinent. India&#x27;s Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the subcontinent for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India&#x27;s best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets.

=====First class competitions=====
* Ranji Trophy – It was founded as the &#x27;Cricket Championship of India&#x27; at a meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India in July 1934. The first Ranji Trophy fixtures took place in the 1934–35 season. Syed Mohammed Hadi of Hyderabad was the first batsman to score a century in the tournament. The Trophy was donated by H. H. Sir Bhupendra Singh Mahinder Baha-dur, Maharajah of Patiala in memory of his late Highness Sir Ranjitsinhji Vibhaji of Nawanagar, affectionately called Ranjitsinhji. In the main, the Ranji Trophy is composed of teams representing the states that makeup India. The number of competing teams has increased over the years. Some states have more than one cricket team, e.g., Maharashtra and Gujarat. There are also teams for Railways and Services representing the armed forces. The various teams used to be grouped into zones – North, West, East, Central and South – and the initial matches were played on a league basis within the zones. The top two teams until 1991–92 and then the top three teams in the subsequent years from each zone then played in a national knock-out competition. Starting with the 2002–03 season, the zonal system was abandoned and a two-division structure was adopted with two teams being promoted from the plate league and two relegated from the elite league. If the knockout matches are not finished, they are decided on the first-inning lead.
*Duleep Trophy – Named after Duleepsinhji, the Duleep Trophy competition, which is a first-class competition, was started by the Board of Control for Cricket in India in 1961–62 with the aim of providing a greater competitive edge in domestic cricket, because apart from the knock-out stages of the Ranji Trophy, that competition proved to be highly predictable, with Bombay winning the Ranji Trophy for fifteen consecutive years. The Duleep Trophy was also meant to help the selectors to assess the form of top cricketers playing against each other. The original format had five teams, which were drawn from the five zones (i.e. North, South, East, West and central) and played each other on a knock-out basis. From the 1993–94 season, the competition has been converted to a league format.
*Irani Trophy – The Irani Trophy tournament was conceived during the 1959–60 season to mark the completion of 25 years of the Ranji Trophy championship and was named after the late Z. R. Irani, who was associated with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from its inception in 1928, till his death in 1970 and a keen patron of the game. The first match, played between the Ranji Trophy champions and the Rest of India was played in 1959–60. For the first few years, it was played at the tail end of the season. Realising the importance of the fixture, the BCCI moved it to the beginning of the season. Since 1965–66, it has traditionally heralded the start of the new domestic season. The Irani Trophy game ranks high in popularity and importance. It is one of the few domestic matches followed with keen interest by cricket lovers in the country.

<text>The  (, , abbr. ORF ) is an Austrian national public broadcaster. Funded from a combination of television licence fee revenue and limited on-air advertising, ORF is the dominant player in the Austrian broadcast media. Austria was the last country in continental Europe after Albania to allow nationwide private television broadcasting, although commercial TV channels from neighbouring Germany have been present in Austria on pay-TV and via terrestrial overspill since the 1980s. 

== History of broadcasting in Austria ==
The first unregulated test transmissions in Austria began on 1 April 1923 by Radio Hekaphon, run by the radio pioneer and enthusiast (1887–1958), who applied for a radio licence in 1921; first in his telephone factory in the Brigittenau district of Vienna, later in the nearby TGM technical college. On 2 September, it aired a first broadcast address by Austrian President Michael Hainisch (1858–1940). One year later, a powerful transmitter, designed by the German Telefunken company, was installed on the roof of the former War Ministry building in in central Vienna.

=== Radio Verkehrs AG ===
It was, however, the public (&#x27;Radio Communication Company Ltd&#x27;, RAVAG), a joint venture of the Austrian Federal Government, the City of Vienna and several bank companies, which, in February 1924, was awarded the concession to begin broadcasting, with Czeja as its director-general. Regular transmissions began on 1 October 1924 from provisional studios inside the War Ministry building that was to become known as . By the end of October 1924 it already had 30,000 listeners, and by January 1925 100,000. Relay transmitters, established across the country by 1934, ensured that all Austrians could listen to at a monthly fee of two schillings.

Radio programmes often aimed at an educated audience, featuring classical music, literature, and lectures. Early RAVAG shows, however, already catered to children and &quot;arts and crafts&quot; (e.g. Bastelstunde). The first outside broadcasts aired in 1925, transmitted from the Vienna State Opera and the Salzburg Festival. On the other hand, news broadcasts only played a minor part out of deference to the Austrian press and the &#x27;neutralism&#x27; policy of the federal government (the July Revolt of 1927 was not even mentioned). Nevertheless, also regular sportscasts began in 1928 and in 1930 the Austrian legislative election was comprehensively covered. At that time, RAVAG registered about 500,000 listeners, having become a mass medium.

In the course of the abolition of the First Austrian Republic and the implementation of the Austrofascist Ständestaat by Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß in 1934, the studios were armed during the Austrian Civil War in February, as well as by the protagonists of the Nazi July Putsch, when several insurgents entered the studio and had Dollfuß&#x27;s resignation announced (he actually was killed in his occupied Chancellery office). Dollfuß&#x27;s successor Kurt Schuschnigg (1897–1977) had the demolished broadcasting centre replaced by the new building (present-day ) near the Theresianum academy in Wieden, Vienna, designed by Clemens Holzmeister (1886–1983) and erected from 1935 to 1939. The Austrian government widely used RAVAG broadcasts for propaganda activities, defying massive cross-border Nazi propaganda broadcasts aired from German transmitters in the Munich region, but also promoted the live transmission of mass celebrations.
With the Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; to Nazi Germany and the invasion of Wehrmacht troops in 1938, RAVAG was dissolved and replaced by &#x27; subordinate to the national Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft network (&#x27; from 1939) in Berlin, where programmes were also produced from. One of the last RAVAG transmissions was Schuschnigg&#x27;s farewell address on 11 March 1938 (&#x27;God Save Austria&#x27;). Only hours later, live broadcasts featured the cheering devotees of his Nazi successor Arthur Seyss-Inquart (1892–1946), the triumphant entry of Adolf Hitler in Linz the next day, and his speech on Heldenplatz in Vienna. In 1939, the former RAVAG transmission facilities were taken over by the German &quot;Reichspost&quot;.

In World War II, listening to &quot;Feindsender&quot; (&#x27;enemy radio stations&#x27;) became a capital offence, however, such stations such as the Swiss Radio Beromünster as well as the German-language programmes of the BBC, Voice of America (VOA) and Vatican Radio, were widely used information sources. &#x27; transmissions were important for strategic bombing alerts. The &#x27; broadcasting centre itself was damaged by Allied bombs in January and February 1945, followed by the Red Army Vienna Offensive. &quot;&quot; last aired 6 April, before retiring &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; troops blew up the Bisamberg transmitter.
Following the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; defeat, independent Austrian RAVAG radio broadcasting resumed in Allied-occupied Austria 24 April 1945, when it announced the formation of a provisional Austrian state government led by Karl Renner (1870–1950). A new station was founded, broadcasting from &quot;&quot; by a provisional transmitter on the rooftop, once again under Oskar Czeija, who nevertheless was ousted shortly afterward on pressure by the Soviet military administration. As the was located in the Soviet occupation sector of Vienna, the Western Allies established their own radio stations like the network on British-occupied territory, on US-occupied territory, &quot;Sendegruppe West&quot; on French-occupied territory, as well as the American English-speaking &#x27;Blue Danube&#x27; armed forces network (BDN; not to be confused with the later Blue Danube Radio) and the British Forces Network (BND), which became quite popular with younger Austrian listeners. The RAVAG/Radio Wien transmissions were limited to the Eastern Austrian Soviet occupation zone, and as the Cold War progressed was increasingly considered Communist propaganda broadcasting.

Several other radio stations began broadcasting in the different occupation zones and radio became a popular medium among Austrians: in 1952 there were 1.5 million radio sets in Austrian homes. The Western Allies could operate their programmes nationwide from Vienna, with a significantly higher popularity rating than the outdated RAVAG transmissions. In 1955, the various regional stations were brought together as the (&#x27;Austrian Broadcasting Entity&#x27;) which later, in 1957, became the , forerunner of today&#x27;s ORF.

== Radio channels ==
* Ö1 – ORF&#x27;s cultural and principal news channel
* Hitradio Ö3 – pop music channel
* FM4 – channel for (alternative) youth culture

The former Ö2 has been replaced by nine regional channels (one for each Bundesland, or federal state):
* Radio Burgenland
* Radio Kärnten
* Radio Niederösterreich
* Radio Oberösterreich
* Radio Salzburg
* Radio Steiermark
* Radio Tirol
* Radio Vorarlberg
* Radio Wien
* Radio Slovenski

All of these radio channels are broadcast terrestrially on FM and via the digital service of the SES Astra satellites at 19.2° east.

All of ORF&#x27;s domestic radio channels are also streamed over the internet. An extra 24-hour all-news channel is available exclusively via internet: this is Ö1 Inforadio which relays all of Ö1&#x27;s news content and fills the &#x27;gaps&#x27;, during which Ö1 is transmitting music and cultural programmes, with additional news broadcasts.

An additional service, Radio 1476, formerly broadcast on medium wave each evening from 18.00 until just after midnight. Its schedule was a mixture of items from Ö1, programmes for linguistic and cultural minorities, folk music, and special productions.

== Television channels ==
* ORF 1
* ORF 2 (with regional programmes)
* ORF 2 Europe
* ORF III
* ORF Sport +
* ORF Kids
* 3sat (in association with ARD, ZDF and SRF)

The ORF television channels are broadcast terrestrially and via the SES Astra 1H satellite at 19.2° east. Via satellite ORF 1 and ORF2 are encrypted, allowing only Austrian residents who pay the Austrian television licence fee (GIS) to watch them. ORF2 Europe is unencrypted and receivable via satellite in Europe.

ORF is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface. From 6 March 1995 ORF broadcasts 24 hours a day.

== Regional studios ==
The ORF has one regional studio in each state, where each state produces its own radio and state television, which is broadcast over ORF2. The regional studio in Tyrol, also produces regional television and radio for the German-speaking population of South Tyrol, Italy. Even though each state has its own studio, most ORF productions are heavily focused on Vienna, since most shows are made there.

== Funding ==
The ORF is funded by a television license fee, which since 1998 has been administered by its subsidiary (GIS). The amount payable differs by state. As of 2022, Styria has the highest annual television licence cost, at €343.80, and Salzburg and Burgenland have the highest annual radio licence cost, at €94.92. Annual fees from July 2022 are:
From January 2024, as part of reforms to the ORF tabled by the Nehammer Cabinet, the GIS organisation will be abolished and its associated TV licensing fee is expected to be replaced with a new compulsory ORF household tax, administered by &quot;ORF-Beitrags Service GmbH&quot;. As a result, some loopholes such as removing the antenna or tuner from television sets in order to declare them &quot;GIS-Free&quot; and hence exempt from the GIS fee (declared legal in a report to the Austrian Parliament in 2008, and confirmed as such by the Supreme Administrative Court of Austria in 2015, hence creating a market for selling regular and smart TVs without built-in antennas or tuners) will be closed under the new system.

== Editorial independence ==
, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated ORF to be &quot;Independent Public Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

== Major stars ==
Many of Austria&#x27;s best known TV stars work for ORF. According to surveys the most prominent television presenter in the country is former alpine skier Armin Assinger who is the host of the &quot;&quot;, Austria&#x27;s version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;. Mirjam Weichselbraun, a former MTV presenter is co-host of &quot;Dancing Stars&quot;, Austria&#x27;s edition of &quot;Dancing With the Stars&quot;. The most popular comedy show on ORF is &quot;Wir sind Kaiser&quot; (&#x27;We Are Emperor&#x27;) with comedian Robert Palfrader playing Emperor Robert Heinrich I, inviting celebrity guests to make fun of them. The best known news anchors are talk show host who was given seven Romy awards as most popular presenter; Armin Wolf who is best known for his hard-hitting interviews on the late evening news show &quot;ZiB 2&quot;; and , moderator of the weekly political magazine &quot;Report&quot;.

== Logos ==
The ORF&#x27;s first corporate logo, called the &#x27;ORF eye&#x27;, was designed by the Austrian illustrator and cartoonist Erich Sokol in 1968, who also served as ORF&#x27;s chief graphics artist and later as art director from 1967 until 1992. The &#x27;ORF eye&#x27; logo is often compared to the &#x27;CBS Eye&#x27; logo used by the American commercial broadcaster CBS. In 1992, ORF commissioned the British graphic designer Neville Brody to design its current corporate logo, which was soon nicknamed the &#x27;ORF bricks&#x27;. The 1968 &#x27;ORF eye&#x27; logo however continued to be used sporadically (for example on the title cards of &quot;Zeit im Bild&quot;) until it was completely phased out in 2011.

<doc id="537200" wikidata="Q597846" url="?curid=537200" title="Honey (2003 film)">
<text>Honey is a 2003 American dance film directed by Billie Woodruff (in his feature film directorial debut). It stars Jessica Alba, Mekhi Phifer, Romeo Miller, Joy Bryant, and David Moscow, with a cameo by Missy Elliott and featured performances by Tweet, Jadakiss, Ginuwine, and Blaque.

==Plot==
Honey Daniels works as a bartender, a record store clerk and a dance teacher at a NYC community center run by her mother. She wants to become a hip hop choreographer, though her mother presses her to teach ballet uptown.

Honey and her rival Katrina are recorded having a dance off. She and her friend Gina find brothers Benny and Raymond street dancing and invite them to her classes. The dance-off video reaches video director Michael Ellis, who hires Honey as a backup dancer and later as a choreographer. Her career brings money and fame, but takes her away from the center and the neighborhood kids.

After Benny gets into a fight, Honey hires him as her assistant to keep him out of trouble. She convinces Michael to hire her students as dancers in Ginuwine&#x27;s new video. Honey begins dating Raymond&#x27;s barber Chaz, who inspires her to prioritize her happiness over fame. She puts down a deposit on an old store she can turn into a dance studio. Michael insists Honey go with him to an &quot;important meeting,&quot; causing her to cancel the birthday trip with Gina. The meeting turns out to be a networking party, where Michael drunkenly hits on her. She slaps him and leaves. The next day, Gina is furious to see a photo of Honey at the party. At the Ginuwine shoot, Michael fires Honey and the kids for her spurning him, replacing her with Katrina.

Honey is forced to break the bad news to the kids, who are heartbroken over losing their chance to be in a music video. Benny returns to drug dealing, only to get arrested and land in juvie. Honey then visits him shortly before his release and mentions that she wants to help him once he is out, but he starts to insult her. She attempts to express disappointment about his choices, but Benny continues belittling her and tells her to leave him alone. As she prepares to leave, Honey manages to ask Benny how often his gangster friends have visited, causing him to become visibly saddened and silent. She then departs and he instantly regrets his rudeness towards her, realizing that she was the only one that cared enough to visit him due his gang &quot;friends&quot; not truly caring about him and his own mother and brother’s refusal to visit because of their disappointments in him. He also realizes that he has mainly disappointed himself by making wrong decisions that could get him imprisoned for life or killed.

Gina eventually forgives Honey, and encourages her to trust in herself. As Honey&#x27;s income dries up due to Michael&#x27;s influence in the industry, she is unable to pay the remainder of the store&#x27;s down payment, which will soon go back on the market. Honey decides to hold a dance benefit and newly-released Benny brings his dance friends to help, teaching them some moves he learned while in juvy.

Michael pushes Katrina as choreographer for a Missy Elliott video, but Missy prefers Honey. Having realized his huge mistake, Michael profusely apologises to Honey and begs her come back, offering to buy her the studio. Realizing that he is in major trouble with his artists, Honey calls him out on his hypocrisy and selfishness. She rejects his offer and makes him realize that he both messed up her career and betrayed and hurt the kids out of his own pettiness. She then tells Michael that she will get the studio on her own merits and leaves him feeling regretful over his actions.

Gina&#x27;s bank manager asks arts donors to attend the benefit, which is a full house and everyone is enthusiastic about the performances. Honey&#x27;s mother sees that the dance form her daughter loves can give her everything that ballet could. The bank manager assures Honey the building is fully funded.

Missy arrives as the benefit finishes, rushing in to meet Honey. She introduces Honey to Blaque at her new dance studio, &quot;The Bronx Dance Center&quot;, to prepare their new video.

==Cast==
* Jessica Alba as Honey Daniels, a hip-hop choreographer
* Mekhi Phifer as Chaz, a barber, Honey&#x27;s boyfriend
* Romeo Miller (credited as Lil&#x27; Romeo) as Benny
* Joy Bryant as Gina, Honey&#x27;s best friend
* David Moscow as Michael Ellis, a music producer
* Lonette McKee as Mrs. Connie Daniels, Honey&#x27;s mom
* Zachary Isaiah Williams as Raymond, Benny&#x27;s brother
* Laurie Ann Gibson as Katrina, Honey&#x27;s rival

A number of popular hip hop and R&amp;B musicians, groups and producers play themselves in prominent cameos, including Missy Elliott, Jadakiss, Sheek Louch, Shawn Desman, Ginuwine, Rodney Jerkins, 3rd Storee, Tweet, and Blaque.

==Production==
The film is inspired by the life of choreographer Laurieann Gibson, who was the film&#x27;s choreographer and appeared on screen as Katrina, the main character&#x27;s rival.
Singer/actress Aaliyah was reportedly originally cast as Honey, though the role was later recast to Jessica Alba due to Aaliyah&#x27;s death in August 2001. However, in 2020, director Bille Woodruff debunked the rumor, stating: &quot;That’s incorrect. It was supposed to be Beyoncé. That’s been widely reported but it’s incorrect, [Beyoncé] couldn’t do it because of her touring schedule for her first album &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot;.&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical response===

&quot;Honey&quot; was released to mostly negative reviews. 
Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 21% based on reviews from 116 critics, with an average rating of 4.20/10. The critical consensus reads, &quot;An attractive Jessica Alba and energetic dance numbers provide some lift to this corny and formulaic movie&quot;.
Metacritic, based on 30 reviews, gives the film a score of 37 out of 100, signifying generally unfavorable reviews.

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was one of the critics to give the film a positive review, noting that it &quot;brings out the wholesome, affirmative side of the hip-hop aesthetic without being overly preachy, although it will not impress anyone with its originality.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened at #2 at the U.S. box office, earning US$12.9 million in its opening weekend, behind &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;. The final box office was $30.3 million in the U.S. and Canada and $31.9 million in other countries, for a total of $65.3 million worldwide.

==Music==

A soundtrack containing hip hop, R&amp;B, funk and disco music was released on November 11, 2003 by Elektra Records. It peaked at #105 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #47 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts.

==Sequels==
Bille Woodruff, the director of &quot;Honey&quot;, also directed three sequels, the theatrically released &quot;Honey 2&quot; (2011) and two straight-to-video sequels &quot;Honey 3: Dare to Dance&quot; (2016) and &quot;&quot; (2018), each with different casts.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-107 was a prototype Soviet military transport aircraft developed from the Tupolev Tu-104. It featured a rear ramp loading door and was intended to carry light vehicles, artillery pieces, or up to 70 paratroopers. The fuselage was unpressurized, which meant that passengers would have to use oxygen masks. A single prototype was built and flown, but the aircraft was not put in production.

<text>The Tupolev Tu-110 (NATO reporting name: Cooker) was a jet airliner designed and built in the USSR, which saw its maiden flight in 1957.

== Design and development ==

Realising that the export potential for the Tupolev Tu-104 was limited, the Council of Ministers issued directive No. 1511–846 on 12 August 1956, requiring the Tupolev Design Bureau to develop a four-engined version of the Tu-104, to enable the aircraft to safely cross large expanses of ocean, and improve safety on takeoff in case of engine failure.

The Tu-110 was a major redesign of the Tu-104, powered by four Lyulka AL-7 turbojets rated at 5,500 kgf (53.9 kN; 12,100 lbf) thrust each, with two staggered engines in the root of each extended centre-section. The first prototype was flown on 11 March 1957.

Production of the Tu-110 was authorised at the Kazan Aircraft Factory, with an initial order for ten aircraft, but only three aircraft were completed before the programme was terminated. The production aircraft featured extended-chord wings and enlarged baggage holds, as well as seating for up to 100 passengers in an all-tourist class seating arrangement.

All four aircraft were converted to Tu-110Bs with Soloviev D-20 turbofan engines, in an attempt to improve the performance of the aircraft, but to no avail. No further orders were forthcoming and the four Tu-110Bs were used for experimental work on avionics, missile systems and boundary layer control systems, remaining active into the 1970s.

==Variants==
Data from &quot;Tupolev Tu-104&quot;
* Tu-110 – The sole prototype of the Tu-110 (CCCP-L5600).

<text>The Campaign for Social Democracy was a minor political party which ran candidates in the February 1974 United Kingdom general election.

==History==
The party was formed in September 1973 by Dick Taverne, who had resigned from the Labour Party, after falling out with his Constituency Labour Party over the European Economic Community.

Taverne had formed the Democratic Labour Association in Lincoln and had been elected as an MP for Lincoln under that banner in a by-election in March, 1973. He formed the Campaign for Social Democracy as an attempt to build a radical non-doctrinaire social democratic movement, and at the February 1974 general election they stood four candidates against leading Labour left-wingers, including Tony Benn.

All candidates were unsuccessful, with the highest polling at 2.4% of the vote in their constituency. The campaign ended when the Labour Party won the October 1974 United Kingdom general election, making a split in the Labour Party less likely. Such a split did occur in the early-1980s, when leading moderate in the Labour Party formed the Social Democratic Party.

==Election results==

<text>Gun dogs (gundogs) or bird dogs are types of hunting dogs developed to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game, typically various fowls that are shot down on the wing (in flight). The term hunting dog is broad and includes all breeds and skills of hunting canines, but &quot;gun dogs&quot; refers to canines that are trained to work alongside a loud firearm while hunting or retrieving game. Gun dogs are divided into three main categories: pointers and retrievers, setters and spaniels, and water dogs.

== Types ==
There are several breeds used as gundogs with varying instinctive skill sets for each one. Gun dogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, pointing breeds, and water dogs.

<text>William Francis Giauque (; May 12, 1895 – March 28, 1982) was a Canadian-born American chemist and Nobel laureate. He was recognized in 1949, for his studies in the properties of matter, at temperatures close to absolute zero. He spent virtually all of his educational and professional career at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Biography==
William Francis Giauque was born in Niagara Falls, Ontario, on May 12, 1895.

His father (William Tecumseh Giauque) was an American citizen, and so William Francis Giauque was conferred American citizenship, despite being born in Canada, allowing him to attend public grammar schools in Michigan. In 1908, his father died, and he returned to Canada for his secondary education. After completing a two-year business course at the Niagara Falls Collegiate Institute, he searched for work in the field of electrical engineering, and eventually found employment at the Hooker Electrochemical Company in Niagara Falls, New York. He decided to become a chemical engineer through his experience there.

After two years of employment, he entered the College of Chemistry of the University of California, Berkeley, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in 1920. He entered graduate school at Berkeley, becoming a University Fellow (1920–1921) and a James M. Goewey Fellow (1921–1922). He received the Ph.D. degree in chemistry with a minor in physics in 1922. 

Giauque was elected a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1936, a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1940, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950.

===Research ===
Although he began university study with an interest in becoming an engineer, he soon developed an interest in research under the influence of Professor Gilbert N. Lewis. Due to his outstanding performance as a student, he became an instructor of chemistry at Berkeley in 1922 and after passing through various grades of professorship, he became a full professor of chemistry in 1934. He retired in 1962.

===Absolute zero===
He became interested in the third law of thermodynamics as a field of research during his experimental research for his Ph.D. research under Professor George Ernest Gibson comparing the relative entropies of glycerine crystals and glass.

The principal objective of his researches was to demonstrate through range of appropriate tests that the third law of thermodynamics is a basic natural law. In 1926, he proposed a method for observing temperatures considerably below 1 Kelvin (1 K is −457.87 °F or −272.15 °C). His work with D.P. MacDougall between 1933 and 1935 successfully employed them.

He developed a magnetic refrigeration device of his own design in order to achieve this outcome, getting closer to absolute zero than many scientists had thought possible. This trailblazing work, apart from proving one of the fundamental laws of nature led to stronger steel, better gasoline and more efficient processes in a range of industries.

His research and that of his students included a large number of entropy determinations from low temperature measurements, particularly on condensed gases. The entropies and other thermodynamic properties of many gases were also determined from quantum statistics and molecular energy levels available from band spectra as well as other sources.

His correlated investigations of the entropy of oxygen with Herrick L. Johnston, led to the discovery of oxygen isotopes 17 and 18 in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and showed that physicists and chemists had been using different scales of atomic weight for years without recognising it.

===Personal life===
In 1932, Giauque married Dr. Muriel Frances Ashley and they had two sons. He died on March 28, 1982, in Berkeley, California.

<doc id="537221" wikidata="Q4758799" url="?curid=537221" title="Andrew Vicari">
<text>Andrew Vicari (born Andrea Antonio Giovanni Vaccari; 20 April 1932 – 3 October 2016) was a Welsh painter working in France, who established a career painting portraits of prominent people. Despite being largely unknown in his own country, Vicari was Britain&#x27;s richest living painter, and at one time Britain&#x27;s 18th richest person.

==Early life==
Vicari was born in Port Talbot, Wales, in 1932 to Italian parents, Vittorio Vaccari (&#x27;tobacconist and confectioner&#x27;), and his wife, Italini Bertani, from Parma. He was evacuated to Aberdare during World War II. He later attended Neath Grammar School for Boys. Aged 12 he won the Gold Medal for Painting at the Wales National Eisteddfod. Between 1950 and 1952 he studied painting at the Slade School of Fine Art at University College London (UCL) under William Coldstream and occasionally Lucian Freud as teachers. He had initially been refused a place at the Slade and was only admitted when someone dropped out.

==Career==
After only two years, in 1952, Vicari left the Slade without completing his diploma course and went to Florence. He stayed there and in Rome for two years before returning &#x27;penniless&#x27; to the UK. He then began working in London as a portrait painter and in 1961 a large show of his work was put on in the former Debenhams showroom near Leicester Square financed by the band leader and impresario Jack Hylton. Eschewing modern trends, he remained a figurative artist working in oil. His work is appreciated worldwide, especially in the Middle East where three museums are solely dedicated to his work.

In 1974, Vicari was appointed as the official painter to the King and Government of Saudi Arabia. In the following decades, he painted many portraits of the Saudi royal family as well as scenes of Riyadh and Bedouin life. It is largely due to this patronage that Vicari owed his financial success and in 2011 earned him the title &quot;The Rembrandt of Riyadh&quot; from &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2001, he sold a collection of 125 paintings of the First Gulf War to Prince Khaled for £17 million.

==Personal life==
Vicari lived and worked at his studio outside Nice, France, although he also owned apartments in Riyadh and Monte Carlo.

In 2006 his fortune was valued at £92 million by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List. In October 2014, however, it was reported that Vicari had filed for bankruptcy and had been in poor health.

Vicari died at Morriston Hospital, Swansea on 3 October 2016 at the age of 84.

In contrast to his sister, Margaret, who wrote a 1999 memoir about her childhood titled &quot;Dream Catcher&quot;, Salinger is a devoted protector of his father&#x27;s privacy. A few weeks after Margaret&#x27;s book was published, Salinger wrote a letter to &quot;The New York Observer,&quot; disparaging his sister&#x27;s &quot;gothic tales of our supposed childhood.&quot;

<text>Dick Taverne, Baron Taverne, (born 18 October 1928) is a British politician and life peer who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Lincoln from 1962 to 1974. A member of the Liberal Democrats, he was a Labour MP until his deselection in 1972, following which he resigned his seat and won the subsequent by-election in 1973 as a Democratic Labour candidate.

Taverne&#x27;s 1973 victory in Lincoln was short-lived; despite retaining his seat at the February 1974 general election, Labour regained the seat at the October 1974 general election, by the future cabinet minister Margaret Beckett. However, his success opened the possibility of a realignment on the left of British politics, which took shape in 1981 as the Social Democratic Party (SDP), which Taverne joined. He later joined the Liberal Democrats when the SDP merged with the Liberal Party. He has sat as a Liberal Democrat life peer since 1996.

==Career==
Educated at Charterhouse School, and then Balliol College, Oxford, he graduated in Philosophy and Ancient History, qualified as a barrister in 1954 and became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) in 1965.

Taverne unsuccessfully contested Putney as the Labour Party candidate at the 1959 general election, and was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lincoln at a by-election in March 1962.
Under Harold Wilson&#x27;s premiership in the 1960s, he served as a Home Office Minister from 1966 to 1968, Minister of State at the Treasury from 1968 to 1969 and then as Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1969 to 1970. In 1970, he helped to launch the Institute for Fiscal Studies, now an influential independent think tank and was the first Director, later chairman.

In 1972, Taverne was deselected by the Lincoln Constituency Labour Party, who disagreed with his pro-European Economic Community views. He then resigned from the Labour Party and from Parliament, and formed the Lincoln Democratic Labour Association. He was re-elected as an Independent Democratic Labour candidate at a by-election in March 1973, and held the seat at the February 1974 general election.

Taverne lost his seat in Parliament at the October 1974 general election. but he continued to remain active with the Democratic Labour Association until it folded after the 1979 general election. He was a leading social democratic thinker, publishing &quot;The Future of the Left: Lincoln and After&quot; in 1974.

When the Social Democratic Party (SDP) was formed in the early 1980s, he joined them, serving on their national committee from 1981 until 1987. He stood as an SDP candidate in the 1982 Peckham by-election, coming second with 32% of the vote, and in the 1983 general election, he stood in Dulwich, coming third with 22%. When the SDP merged with the Liberal Party he joined the new Liberal Democrats, serving on its Federal Policy Committee from 1989 until 1990. On 5 February 1996 he was created a life peer as Baron Taverne, &quot;of Pimlico in the City of Westminster&quot;, and sits in the House of Lords as a Liberal Democrat. In May 2006 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the Liberal Democrats in local elections to Westminster City Council in the Marylebone High Street ward.

Taverne was elected President of the Research Defence Society in 2004. He was a member of the House of Lords Committee on the Use of Animals in Scientific Procedures, and is currently a member of the Science and Technology Committee of the House of Lords. He is the author of &quot;The March of Unreason&quot;, published by Oxford University Press in March 2005.

==Personal life and other activity==
In 1955, he married Janice Hennessey, a scientist. He became interested in science and public policy, and in 2002 founded Sense about Science, a charity with the objective of advancing public understanding of science and the evidence-based approach to scientific issues. 

He is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a Distinguished Supporter of Humanists UK, as well as a vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group. He is a former member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group. He won the Science Writers&#x27; Award as Parliamentary Science Communicator of the Year 2005. He is a listed member of Republic, the campaign for abolishing the monarchy.

On 15 September 2010, Taverne, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the UK.

Taverne was interviewed in 2012 as part of The History of Parliament&#x27;s oral history project.

In 2014, Taverne published his memoir, &quot;Against the Tide&quot;.

<text>French Somaliland (; ) was a French colony in the Horn of Africa. It existed between 1884 and 1967, at which became the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas. The Republic of Djibouti is its legal successor state.

==History==
French Somaliland was formally established in 1896 when the ruler and elders of the Issa clan signed treaties with the French. On March 25, 1885, the French signed a treaty with the Gadabuursi, effectively making them a protectorate of France. On March 26, 1885, the French signed another treaty with the Issa making the latter a protectorate under the French. No money changed hands and the Somalis did not sign away any of their land rights; the agreement was meant to protect their land from outsiders with the help of the French. However, after the French sailors of the Le Pingouin vessel were mysteriously killed in Ambado in 1886, the French first blamed the British, then the Somalis, using the incident to lay claim to the entire southern territory.

The construction of the Imperial Ethiopian Railway west into Ethiopia turned the port of Djibouti into a boomtown of 15,000 at a time when Harar was the only city in Ethiopia with a greater population. Although the city&#x27;s population fell after the completion of the line to Dire Dawa and the bankruptcy (and subsequent government bail-out) of the original company, the rail link allowed Djibouti to quickly overtake the caravan-based trade out of Zeila (then in British Somaliland) and become the premier port for coffee and other goods leaving southern Ethiopia and the Ogaden through Harar. Before the French aligned with the Issa, the Gadabuursi held the position of the first Senator of the country, and is the first Somali head of state to lead the territory compromising Djibouti today. Djama Ali Moussa, a former sailor, pursued his political aspirations and managed to become the first Somali democratically elected head of state in French Somaliland.

The railway continued operating after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia, but following the tumult of the Second World War, the area became a French overseas territory in 1946. In 1967, French Somaliland was renamed the French Territory of the Afars and the Issas and, in 1977, became the independent country of Djibouti.

<text>Edna Mae Durbin (December 4, 1921 – April 17, 2013), known professionally as Deanna Durbin, was a Canadian-born American singer and actress, who moved to the U.S. with her family in infancy. She appeared in musical films in the 1930s and 1940s. With the technical skill of a legitimate lyric soprano, she was known for singing opera and semi-classical music, which is today called classical crossover.

Durbin was a child actress who made her first film appearance with Judy Garland in &quot;Every Sunday&quot; (1936), and subsequently signed a contract with Universal Studios. She achieved success as the ideal teenaged daughter in films such as &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot; (1936), &quot;One Hundred Men and a Girl&quot; (1937), and &quot;It Started with Eve&quot; (1941). Her work was credited with saving the studio from bankruptcy, and led to Durbin being awarded the Academy Juvenile Award in 1938.

As she matured, Durbin grew dissatisfied with the girl-next-door roles assigned to her and attempted to move into sophisticated non-musical roles with film noir &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; (1944) and the whodunit &quot;Lady on a Train&quot; (1945). These films, produced by frequent collaborator and second husband Felix Jackson, were not as successful; she continued in musical roles until her retirement. Upon her retirement and divorce from Jackson in 1949, Durbin married producer-director Charles Henri David and moved to a farmhouse near Paris. She withdrew from public life, granting only one interview on her career in 1983.

==Early life==
The younger child of James Allen Durbin and Ada Tomlinson Read, natives of Greater Manchester, England who relocated to Winnipeg, Canada, Deanna had an elder sister, Edith. When she was an infant, Durbin&#x27;s family moved from Winnipeg to Los Angeles, and she and her family became United States citizens in 1928. By the time she was 10, her sister recognized that she had definite talent and enrolled her in voice lessons at the Ralph Thomas Academy. Durbin soon became Thomas&#x27;s prize pupil, and he showcased her talent at various local clubs and churches.

==Career and life==
===1935–1941: Early career===
In early 1935, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was planning a biographical film on the life of opera star Ernestine Schumann-Heink and was having difficulty finding an actress to play the young opera singer. MGM casting director Rufus LeMaire heard about a talented young soloist performing with the Ralph Thomas Academy and called her in for an audition. Durbin sang &quot;Il Bacio&quot; for the studio&#x27;s vocal coach, who was stunned by her &quot;mature soprano&quot; voice. She sang the number again for Louis B. Mayer, who signed her to a six-month contract. She made her first film appearance in the short &quot;Every Sunday&quot; (1936) with Judy Garland, another teenage singer-actress whose career would rival Durbin&#x27;s. The film was intended as a demonstration of their talent as performers as studio executives had questioned the wisdom of casting two female singers together. Louis B. Mayer decided to sign both, but by then, Durbin&#x27;s contract option had lapsed.

Universal Pictures producer Joe Pasternak wished to borrow Garland from MGM, but she was unavailable. When Pasternak learned that Durbin was no longer with MGM, he instead cast her in the film. At 14 years old, Durbin signed with Universal, giving her the professional name Deanna. Her first feature-length film, &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot; (1936), was a success and established Durbin as a young star. With Pasternak producing for Universal, Durbin starred in a succession of successful musical films, including &quot;One Hundred Men and a Girl&quot; (1937), &quot;Mad About Music&quot; (1938), &quot;That Certain Age&quot; (1938), &quot;Three Smart Girls Grow Up&quot; (1939), and &quot;First Love&quot; (1939)—most of which were directed by Henry Koster.

Durbin also continued to pursue singing projects. In 1936, she auditioned to provide the vocals for Snow White in Disney&#x27;s animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, but was rejected by Walt Disney, who said the 15-year-old Durbin&#x27;s voice was &quot;too old&quot; for the part. Andrés de Segurola, who was the vocal coach working with Universal Studios that became her voice teacher—himself a former Metropolitan Opera singer—believed that Durbin was a potential opera star. De Segurola was commissioned to advise the Metropolitan Opera on her progress. Also in 1936, Durbin began a radio collaboration with Eddie Cantor which lasted until 1938, when her heavy workload for Universal forced her to quit her weekly appearances.

The success of Durbin&#x27;s films was reported to have saved Universal from bankruptcy. In 1938, she received an Academy Juvenile Award with Mickey Rooney. Producer Joe Pasternak said: Durbin continued her success with &quot;It&#x27;s a Date&quot; (1940), &quot;Spring Parade&quot; (1940), and &quot;Nice Girl?&quot; (1941).

===1941–1945: Attempts to expand===

In 1941, Durbin starred in &quot;It Started with Eve&quot; (1941), her last film with Pasternak and director Henry Koster. Pasternak moved from Universal to MGM. Koster wanted to reunite Durbin with Charles Laughton as Christine and Erik in a new version of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; with Erik as Christines&#x27;s father, but Durbin found the script too bloody and rejected it. This father-daughter element made it into &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1943), but it was cut at a late stage. Universal announced Durbin was to star in &quot;They Lived Alone&quot;, scheduled to be directed by Koster. However, Durbin was unhappy with the role, and that Universal had not given support to the career of her first husband, assistant director Vaughn Paul, whom she had married in April 1941. Durbin turned down the role, and was suspended by the studio from October 16, 1941, to early February 1942. In late January 1942, Durbin and Universal settled their differences, with the studio conceding to Durbin the approval of her directors, stories, and songs.

In April 1942 Universal announced a second sequel to &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot;: the wartime-themed &quot;Three Smart Girls Join Up&quot;, in which Durbin would &quot;wear overalls and be either a riveter or a welder&quot;. Durbin issued a statement to the trade papers that she would no longer be appearing in any &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot; pictures and was abandoning the &quot;Penny Craig&quot; character in favor of solo vehicles. The title was changed to &quot;Hers to Hold&quot; (1943), revolving solely around her character. The film almost went unproduced; French director Jean Renoir was hired to direct &quot;Three Smart Girls Join Up&quot;, but a subsequent report announced that the &quot;Three Smart Girls&quot; picture was being replaced by &quot;The Divine Young Lady&quot; (the former &quot;They Lived Alone&quot;), a story of refugee children from China. The project was initially conceived without musical numbers, but Durbin finally relented to Universal&#x27;s demand to include some. The finished film was released as &quot;The Amazing Mrs. Holliday&quot; (1943), with the new title suggestive of MGM&#x27;s wartime hit &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;. 

Co-star Joseph Cotten would later speak highly of Durbin&#x27;s integrity and character. Durbin had an iron will, and was influential in executive decisions at Universal, being one of the company&#x27;s major stockholders. Columnist Jack Lait reported that &quot;Durbin has been hard to deal with since she married. Demands her husband (who was only an assistant) direct her, and what with the $25,000 [salary] ceiling, she&#x27;ll do it her way or no way.&quot; She dabbled in other genres, such as the romantic comedy &quot;His Butler&#x27;s Sister&quot; (1943) and the musical Western &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Singing&quot; (1944), her only Technicolor film, which was produced on location in southern Utah and co-starred Robert Paige. The film featured some of the last melodies written by Jerome Kern. 

Durbin continued her push to establish herself as a more dramatic actress with the film noir &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; (1944), directed by Robert Siodmak and co-starring Gene Kelly. Siodmak praised Durbin&#x27;s acting skills, but later recalled she was difficult as &quot;she wanted to play a new part but flinched from looking like a tramp: she always wanted to look like nice, wholesome Deanna Durbin pretending to be a tramp.&quot; Although the film received mixed reviews, Durbin later called it her &quot;only really good film&quot;. The whodunit &quot;Lady on a Train&quot; (1945) also received mixed reviews. 

Deanna Durbin&#x27;s future husband Charles David and writer Hugh Gray prepared a dramatic thriller for Durbin, &quot;The Fairy Tale Murder&quot;, about a phobic young woman who is terrorized by mysterious criminals. Durbin rejected it, so it was reworked by Leslie Charteris, author of the Saint novels who had co-written Durbin&#x27;s &quot;Lady on a Train&quot;, and reassigned to Universal&#x27;s teenaged singing star Gloria Jean. Charles David remained as director. &quot;Fairy Tale Murder&quot; was filmed in September and October of 1944 but it was held back until September 1945, after Gloria Jean had left the studio&#x27;s employ, and released as &quot;River Gang&quot; (international releases retained the original &quot;Fairy Tale Murder&quot; title).

===1946–1949: Decline and retirement===

Most of Deanna Durbin&#x27;s pictures had been produced by Felix Jackson, whom she married in August 1945; they welcomed their daughter, Jessica Louise, in February 1946. She was then the second-highest-paid woman in the United States, just behind Bette Davis; her fan club ranked as the world&#x27;s largest during her active years. However, while her adult dramatic roles may have been more satisfying for Durbin, it was clear her fans preferred her in light musical confections.

In 1946, Universal merged with two other companies to create Universal-International. The new regime discontinued much of Universal&#x27;s familiar product and scheduled only a few musicals. Jackson left Universal in November 1946; he also left Durbin in January 1947, although their separation was not announced until the following year.

Durbin&#x27;s final four pictures — &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Yours&quot; (1947), &quot;Something in the Wind&quot; (1947), &quot;Up in Central Park&quot; (1948), and &quot;For the Love of Mary&quot; (1948) — all reverted to her previous musical-comedy structure. On August 22, 1948, Universal-International announced a lawsuit which sought to collect wages the studio had paid Durbin in advance. Durbin settled the complaint by agreeing to star in three more pictures, including one in Paris; this did not materialize before Durbin&#x27;s contract expired. She received a $200,000 ($ in ) severance payment.

===1949–2013: Retirement===

Unsatisfied by her career options, Durbin chose to retire and move to Paris. When her former producer Joe Pasternak tried to dissuade her, she told him, &quot;I can&#x27;t run around being a Little Miss Fix-It who bursts into song—the highest-paid star with the poorest material.&quot; In September 1949, Durbin filed for divorce from Jackson, which was finalized in November.

On December 21, 1950, Durbin married French director-producer Charles David, who had previously directed her in &quot;Lady on a Train&quot;. Durbin and David raised a son, Peter David (born in June 1951), as well as Durbin&#x27;s daughter Jessica, on a farm outside of Paris. Durbin turned down several offers for a comeback, including a Broadway role as Eliza Doolittle in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;; she later said, &quot;I had my ticket for Paris in my pocket.&quot; In 1951, she was invited to play in London&#x27;s West End production of &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, and in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film version of the same in 1953, and Sigmund Romberg&#x27;s operetta &quot;The Student Prince&quot; in 1954.

In 1983, film historian David Shipman was granted a rare interview by Durbin. Durbin acknowledged her dislike of the Hollywood studio system, emphasizing that she never identified herself with the public image that the media created around her. She spoke of the Deanna &quot;persona&quot; in the third person, and considered the film character &quot;Deanna Durbin&quot; to be a byproduct of her youth and not her true identity. In private life, Durbin had continued to use her given name, Edna; salary figures printed annually by the Hollywood trade publications listed the actress as &quot;Edna Mae Durbin, player&quot;. Also in the interview, she steadfastly asserted her right to privacy, something she maintained until the end of her life, declining to be profiled on websites.

Durbin&#x27;s husband of almost 50 years, Charles David, died in Paris on March 1, 1999. On April 30, 2013, a newsletter published by the Deanna Durbin Society reported that Durbin had died &quot;in the past few days&quot;, quoting her son, Peter H. David, who thanked her admirers for respecting her privacy. No other details were given. According to the Social Security Death Index (under the name Edna M. David), she died on April 17, 2013 in the 19th arrondissement of Paris.

==Legacy==
Deanna Durbin has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1722 Vine Street. She left her handprints and footprints in front of the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on February 7, 1938. Durbin was well known in Winnipeg, Manitoba (her place of birth), as &quot;Winnipeg&#x27;s Golden Girl&quot; (a reference to one of the city&#x27;s most famous landmarks, the statue &quot;Golden Boy&quot; atop the Manitoba Legislative Building).

Frank Tashlin&#x27;s Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos&quot; (1937) contains a turtle caricature of Deanna Durbin called &quot;Deanna Terrapin&quot;. An unnamed caricature of Durbin also appeared in the Warner Brother&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Malibu Beach Party&quot; (1940).

Durbin figures prominently in the 1963 Ray Bradbury short story &quot;The Anthem Sprinters&quot; (collected in &quot;The Machineries of Joy&quot;). Durbin&#x27;s singing is featured in Alistair MacLean&#x27;s 1955 novel &quot;HMS Ulysses&quot;, being broadcast over the wartime ship&#x27;s internal communication system. She was also referenced in Richard Brautigan&#x27;s novel &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot; (1967), when the narrator claims to have seen one of her movies seven times, but cannot recall which one. She is also mentioned by the character Hatsumi in Haruki Murakami&#x27;s novel Norwegian Wood (in chapter 8), when she says that her grandfather used to brag that he had met Durbin one time in New York.

In song, Durbin&#x27;s name found its way into the introduction to a song written by satirical writer Tom Lehrer in 1965. Prior to singing &quot;Whatever Became of Hubert?&quot;, Lehrer said that Vice President Hubert Humphrey had been relegated to &quot;those where-are-they-now columns: Whatever became of Deanna Durbin, and Hubert Humphrey, and so on.&quot; She is also referenced in the Glenn Miller WWII novelty song &quot;Peggy the Pin-up Girl&quot;. The lyrics pair her name with her first co-star Judy Garland: &quot;Even a voice that&#x27;s so disturbin&#x27; / Like Judy Garland or Miss Durbin / Can&#x27;t compare to my pin-up queen&quot;. In Philippe Mora&#x27;s film &quot;The Return of Captain Invincible&quot; (1983), Christopher Lee sings a song called &quot;Name Your Poison&quot;, written by Richard O&#x27;Brien and Richard Hartley, which has the line, &quot;Think of young Deanna Durbin / And how she sang on rum and bourbon.&quot;

Anne Frank was a fan of Durbin, and pasted two photos of her on the wall in the family&#x27;s hideout; the photos are still on the wall today. One of the photos is from First Love (1939).Winston Churchill was also a fan of Durbin, screening her films &quot;on celebratory wartime occasions&quot;. Russian cellist/conductor Mstislav Rostropovich cites Durbin in the mid-1980s as one of his most important musical influences, stating: &quot;She helped me in my discovery of myself. You have no idea of the smelly old movie houses I patronized to see Deanna Durbin. I tried to create the very best in my music, to try to recreate, to approach her purity.&quot; Indian-Bengali film director Satyajit Ray, in his acceptance speech for an Oscar (Honorary – Lifetime Achievement) in 1992, mentioned Deanna Durbin as the only one of the three cinema personalities he recalled writing to when young who had acknowledged his fan letter with a reply. (The other two were Ginger Rogers and Billy Wilder.) In addition, Deanna Durbin inspired several opera singers, such as Joan Sutherland, who said about the ease of her singing, &quot;I wish I knew how she did it&quot;.

<text>The Cotswold Way is a long-distance footpath, running along the Cotswold Edge escarpment of the Cotswold Hills in England. It was officially inaugurated as a National Trail on 24 May 2007 and several new rights of way have been created.

==History==
The Cotswold Way route was first suggested some 50 years ago by Gloucestershire-area Ramblers, of which Tony Drake (d. 7 March 2012) of Cheltenham area and the late Cyril Trenfield of the South Gloucestershire area were principals. Although recognised as a suitable route for a National Trail in due course, the path was initially sponsored by Gloucestershire County Council, who had no powers of footpath creation, and so used only existing rights of way.

An early guide to the Way, in the hand-drawn pictorial style of Alfred Wainwright, was produced by another Cheltenham-area rambler, Mark Richards, in 1973.

&quot;... it is necessary to trace the history of the project to date. Following the passing of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act of 1949, which made provision for the designation and creation of long distance paths, I put forward the idea of a footpath route following the Cotswold escarpment. This met with great interest but the plans which the Gloucestershire Committee of the Ramblers Association submitted to the National Parks Commission in 1953, though acknowledged and mentioned in the Commission&#x27;s annual report of that year, was nevertheless pigeonholed and largely forgotten until Gloucestershire County Council prepared its recreational plan for the countryside in 1968. The County Council decided to designate a Cotswold Way route itself, using existing public rights of way, and the scheme was launched during Footpath Week in May 1970. The Way has had priority in signposting and waymarking programmes but until the
Countryside Commission get ministerial approval to create a national route, grants will not be available for maintenance and several very desirable rights of way, where none now exist are unlikely to be created.&quot;

==Views==

As it closely follows the scarp of the Cotswold Edge, the Cotswold Way usually affords views, mainly to the north and west—starting in the south with the Severn Estuary and Severn bridges, the meanders of the River Severn above Sharpness, the Forest of Dean, the Welsh hills of Monmouthshire and the Black Mountains on the Welsh border to the west. The distinctive shape of May Hill is visible for much of the route, as is the long spine of the Malvern Hills. Gloucester Cathedral can be seen from the path.

Further north on the path, above Cheltenham, there are old quarries containing rock features such as the Devil&#x27;s Chimney at Leckhampton. After Cleeve Hill the escarpment starts to turn to the east, giving views across the Vale of Evesham. The classic Cotswold villages of Stanton and Stanway are visited, then Broadway village, before the final steep ascent to Broadway Tower and the scenic descent to Chipping Campden.

On a clear day, the Clee Hills near Ludlow can be seen, to the northwest.

==Places of interest==

The trail runs northeast from Bath to Chipping Campden, through or near to the following towns: Old Sodbury, near Chipping Sodbury, Wotton-under-Edge, Dursley, Stroud, Painswick, Cranham, Leckhampton, Cheltenham, Winchcombe, Stanway and Broadway.

It passes numerous places of interest, including the site of the Battle of Lansdowne, the Somerset Monument, the Tyndale Monument, Sudeley Castle, Cleeve Hill, Hailes Abbey, and the Broadway Tower. With the exception of a small stretch around Broadway (which is in Worcestershire), the entire walk is within Gloucestershire (including South Gloucestershire) and Somerset (including Bath and North East Somerset).

==Other recreational use==
*Besides being popular with walkers, the Cotswold Way is run annually as a 10-stage relay (the Cotswold Way Relay) from north to south, usually in late June or early July. The winning team typically takes an aggregate time of about 12 hours. It is run under Fell Runners&#x27; Association rules and organised by City of Bath Athletic Club. It is traditional for the first leg to start from St James Church, Chipping Campden promptly at 7am. The lead runners finish the final leg outside the doors of Bath Abbey at about 6pm.
*In September, the Cotswold Way is run as a single stage race from north to south, leaving Chipping Campden at noon on a Saturday and finishing in Bath from approximately 6am until 6pm the following day in front of Bath Abbey. The race is organised by Cotswold Running.
*The official record for running the Cotswold Way is held by Nathan Montegue of Swindon Harriers, who on 24 September 2014 ran from Chipping Campden to Bath in 19 hours and 31 minutes.

<doc id="537236" wikidata="Q938271" url="?curid=537236" title="Methil">
<text>Methil () is an eastern coastal town in Scotland. It was first recorded as &quot;Methkil&quot; in 1207, and belonged to the Bishop of St Andrews. Two Bronze Age cemeteries have been discovered which date the settlement as over 8,000 years old.
Famous for its High Street that used to have the most pubs per mile in Scotland, it was part of its own barony in 1614 and also part of the former burgh of Buckhaven and Methil. This burgh existed between 1891 and 1975 (following the reorganisation of local government). It is situated within a continuous urban area described as Levenmouth.

Methil lies geographically between Largo Bay to the east and Wemyss Bay to the west. Previously an industrial maritime powerhouse of the region and once Scotland&#x27;s greatest coal port, it is now redirecting itself towards a green energy future. The River Leven delineates Methil from adjacent towns.

==Toponymy==
The name, Methil, is from Scottish Gaelic, and appears to derive from &quot;meadh(on)&quot; meaning &#x27;middle&#x27; and &quot;cill&quot; meaning &#x27;church&#x27;.

Initially centred on the medieval church on the River Leven, the centre moved to a burgh and port in the seventeenth century known also as &quot;Methilltoune&quot; (1670) and &quot;Methilburgh&quot; (1795), with the alternative name of &quot;Innerleven&quot;. William Roy&#x27;s Map of Scotland refers to the town as &quot;Methill Pans&quot;, a reference to the salt industry, with Inverleven indicated as a separate settlement. The town is sometimes referred to locally as The Methil.

==Overview==

Prior to the Reformation when Methil was absorbed into the Parish of Wemyss, it was an independent parish centred around a church situated inland of what is now Methilmill Cemetery. In the 17th century, it developed as a coastal village, first with a tidal harbour, thereafter expanding considerably at the start of the 20th century due to a boom in coal mining.

From 1920 the development of (mainly) council housing caused the town to expand inland to meet up with the formerly separate village of Methilhill and reach the boundaries of Methilmill Cemetery and the site of the ancient parish church.

Historically, the main industry in the area was coal mining, with most of the coal exported through Methil Docks, which exported over 3,000,000 tons per year between the WW1 and WW2. A related development was Methil Power Station (1960), which was sited at the mouth of the River Leven. It was eventually demolished in 2011. This power station used colliery slurry, which would otherwise have gone to waste.

Nearby is the new Bayview Stadium, home to East Fife Football Club, previously located more centrally in the town at the corner of Wellesley and Kirkland Roads.

==Facilities==
Methil Docks was particularly significant during World War II for the movement of coal and other resources. The docks had a hydro electric power station serving the distinctive coal hoists, all of which were once local landmarks. The town was traversed by several railways linking the local collieries to the docks, one of which crossed the High Street on an overbridge. After the post-war nationalisation of the railways, the coal mines and the docks continued to be linked by the Wemyss Private Railway as well as by British Railways (which had replaced the LNER and the North British Railway).

Work is ongoing to reopen the railway line from Thornton Junction, which would arguably help both trade and improve public transport, including tourism for the whole area. It is scheduled to be open for traffic in spring 2024. The &quot;Hydrogen Office&quot; based in the docks aims to demonstrate the benefits of improved energy efficiency and renewable and hydrogen energy systems. 

Kirkland High School and Community College was a secondary education and combined education college. It was amalgamated with Buckhaven High School in August 2016 to form Levenmouth Academy, both of the older schools being demolished immediately thereafter. Primary schools in the area include Denbeath Primary, Aberhill Primary (&#x27;listed&#x27; as of architectural/historical interest and long outliving the 1950s and 1960s secondary school buildings) and Methilhill Primary.

Local politics is controlled by Fife Council although there is interest being shown by some people in redeveloping more locally centred councils. Methilhill had a Community Council for a period of time, although it is not currently active.

There is a committee of Fife councillors elected to represent the area described by Fife Council as &quot;Levenmouth&quot; (which includes Methil and other nearby towns – although the description &quot;Levenmouth&quot; does not have a historical or otherwise substantive reason or purpose as a nomenclature, it does provide for political expediency and accords favourably with current local civil service ease of operation).

<doc id="537239" wikidata="Q757549" url="?curid=537239" title="Atolls of the Maldives">
<text>The Maldives Islands are formed by 20 natural atolls, along with a few islands and isolated reefs today which form a pattern stretching from 7 degrees 10′ North to 0 degrees 45′ South. The largest of these atolls is Boduthiladhunmathi, while the atoll containing the most islands is Huvadhu.

Some atolls are in the form of a number of islands by time and in the form of isolated reefs, which could be classified as smaller atoll formations. All land above the surface in the Maldives is of coralline origin. The atolls of the Maldives form a quite regular chain and, especially in the northern and central atolls, an arrayed structure is apparent. There are broad and deep channels between some atolls. The origin of the word &quot;atoll&quot; itself is in the language of the Maldives. &quot;Atoll&quot; (from ) is now used in many languages worldwide.

Traditionally, Maldivians call the atolls ending in &#x27;-madulu&#x27; or &#x27;-mathi&#x27; by their name without adding the word &quot;Atoll&quot; at the end. For example, it is correct to write simply Kolhumadulhu, without adding the word &#x27;Atholhu&#x27; at the end. This is also the case in the atoll known as Faadhippolhu.

The atolls of the Maldives are very complex structures and were formerly very dangerous for navigators. In 1834–1836, British captain Robert Moresby undertook the laborious and difficult cartography of the Maldives, drawing the first accurate maritime charts of this complicated Indian Ocean atoll group.

These Admiralty charts were printed as three separate large maps by the Hydrographic Service of the Royal Navy. Although they contain a few errors, Moresby&#x27;s charts were so good that they were favoured by Maldivian pilots navigating through the treacherous waters of their atolls until the 1990s.

Nowadays there are more accurate maps of the Maldives based on satellite surveys. However, Maldivian navigators still claim that Captain Moresby&#x27;s charts provide a wealth of data that the modern maps do not give. At the time that they were drawn, the maps of the Maldives were deemed of such high quality that they were inspected personally by Queen Victoria. Even today in some atolls, the modern day marine GPS can be inaccurate. The GPS mapping may indicate reef where it does not exist and does not show other reefs where they are located.

Owing to the many beautiful diving grounds of the numerous atolls of the Maldives, this country has been marketed as a prime destination for scuba divers worldwide.
Hence, during the last couple of decades many guides and maps of the best diving spots have been published and some of them are very accurate and give a wide array of useful hints.

==The Atolls==

===Ihavandhippolhu===
Ihavandhippolhu Atoll is the northernmost atoll in the Maldive. It is a small natural atoll in length.

It has 25 islands lying all around the boundary reef. One long barrier reef forms the western side of the atoll. There are several coral patches in the lagoon and the general depth in the centre is 20 to 30 fathoms (35 to 55 m).

Ihavandhippolhu is bounded in the north by the broad channel known as Māmalē Kandu (or Maliku Kandu) which separates the islands of Maldives from those belonging to India.

Administratively, Ihavandhippolhu belongs to the North Thiladhunmathi (Haa Alifu) Atoll administrative division which also includes the northernmost portion of the Thiladhunmathi natural atoll.

===Thiladhunmathi===
Boduthiladhunmathi Atoll (Tiladummati in the Admiralty Charts) is the largest of the Maldives atolls and the world&#x27;s largest atoll (not taking into account the mostly submerged Great Chagos Bank and Saya de Malha Bank). It is very open, a typical atoll without a clearly delimited lagoon. 

It is a huge atoll stretching SSW for and contains nearly forty islands generally of a fair size. Kelaa, a large island forms a prominent point in the NE of this atoll.

The western boundary has fewer islands but more isolated reefs or micro-atolls (called &quot;faru&quot; in Maldivian), with wide passages between them. The German explorer Hans Hass observed the formation of this phenomenon called &quot;micro-atoll&quot; by Porites corals in the Maldives. Its lagoon has few shoals but many large &quot;faru&quot;, often topped with islands. The average depth is from 18 to 24 fathoms (33 m to 44 m).

The Miladhunmadulu group is also naturally a part of Thiladhunmati Atoll, comprising the southern half of the atoll. The length of this part of the atoll is and it contains 101 islands.

The general depth of the centre of this part is 20 to 25 fathoms (37 m to 46 m) and the bottom is sandy. Along its western edges there are not many islands but more detached reefs with shallow lagoons (called &quot;vilu&quot; in Maldivian) which seldom exceed 10 fathoms (18 m) in depth.

Administratively, Thiladhunmathi Atoll together with the Miladhunmadulu group are divided among four administrative divisions, namely North Thiladhunmathi (Haa Alifu) Atoll, South Thiladhunmathi (Haa Dhaalu) Atoll, North Miladhunmadulu (Shaviyani) Atoll and South Miladhunmadulu (Noonu) Atoll.

===Maamakunudhoo===
Māmakunudhoo Atoll or Makunudhoo (Malcolm Atoll in the Admiralty Chart) is the westernmost atoll in the Maldives. A large reef with lagoon, long with and average breadth of . It has only one inhabited island, Makunudhoo and three other islands (namely Innafushi, Fenboahuraa and Dhipparufushi) and it lies west of the NW part of the Miladhummadulhu group. It is said to have been unknown to non-Maldivians previous to the 1834-36 survey of the Maldives. According to the locals, many ships have been lost on its barren reefs with crew, cargo and all. These include the Persia Merchant (August, 1658), Hayston (July, 1891), George Reid (September, 1872) and many more. Owing to the violence of the surf and the perpendicular sides of the reef scarcely a vestige of the wreck remains after a few hours. The lagoon is quite deep but it is full of coral patches.

===Etthingili Alifushi Atoll===
Etthingili Alifushi Atoll consists of two islands, Alifushi and Etthingili (also known as Kalhifushi), known as &#x27;The Powell Islands&#x27; in the Admiralty Chart. The islands stand on a detached reef of their own with very deep waters (no sounding) between this reef and the northern end of the main Atoll. The length of this atoll is with a width of . Today, of the two islands, only Alifushi is inhabited.

===Maalhosmadulu Uthuruburi===
Maalhosmadulu Uthuruburi (Northern Maalhosmadulu Atoll) is in length from N to S, and across at its broadest part. Its western fringe is composed of a series of round or oval reefs (farus) irregularly placed (a feature peculiar to all the larger Northern Atolls). The centre is heavily dotted with coral patches (&quot;giri&quot;), some submerged and some awash. The concentration of &quot;giri&quot; is especially dense towards its SW quarter, close to Kandholhudhoo Island (where there is the place most crowded with small reefs and shoals in the whole Maldives), but its narrower northern end is quite clear of reefs. The general depths of the lagoon are from 23 to 27 fathoms (42 to 49 m).

===Fasdhūetherē (Fasdhūtherē)===
Fasdhūtherē Atoll. Sandwiched between two atolls, the northern part of South Maalhosmadulu forms a clearly delimited, roughly triangular, natural atoll without a distinctive name (&quot;Fasdhūtherē&quot; merely means &#x27;between five islands&#x27;). It is in length from east to west. It has 11 islands with the only inhabited island being Kudarikilu Island on its SE corner just opposite Landaa Giraavaru Island of Southern Maalhosmadulhu Atoll. Its lagoon becomes narrower towards the west and its average depth is 19 fathoms (35 m). It is separated from North Maalhosmadulhu by a deep channel (known as Moresby Channel in the Admiralty Chart and Hani Kandu locally) and from the southern part of Southern Maalhosmadulhu Atoll by the narrow Geydhoshu Kandu (also known as &quot;Ge&#x27;aa&#x27;badhigedheytherey Kandu&quot;) running from east to west.

===Maalhosmadulu Dhekunuburi===
Maalhosmadulu Dhekunuburi (Southern Maalhosmadulu Atoll) has many large farus on its western side. Its maximum length is . The inner lagoons (vilu) present an idyllic view. The depth of their waters is not more than a few meters, with perhaps a few coral heads awash. Its eastern fringe is a succession of separate, quite regular, oval reefs with some islands. The interior of the lagoon has also large &quot;faru&quot; towards its southern half. The average depth is from 24 to 27 fathoms (44 to 49 m).

===Goidhu Atoll===
Goidhu Atoll or Goifulhafehendhu Atoll ( &#x27;Horsburgh Atoll&#x27; in the Admiralty Chart) is separated from South Maalhosmadulhu by a channel. This atoll is oval in shape and small, its greatest length being . It is composed of 7 islands, 3 of which are inhabited. The inner lagoon has a depth of 17 to 20 fathoms (31 to 37 m); it has a sandy bottom mixed with mud and clay. Unlike the lagoons of most small atolls of the Maldives, this lagoon is free from coral heads in its centre.

===Faadhippolhu===
Faadhippolhu Atoll (better known as Lhaviyani Atoll) is a smaller atoll with a well-defined barrier reef to the east, on which the NE monsoon (iruvai) breaks with violence. Its western side has farus and reef patches. There are about 52 islands, of which only 5 are inhabited.
The lagoon is fairly open and its general depths are from 25 to 30 fathoms (about 50 m). Its bottom is sandy and there are a number of coral patches and sunken reefs dotting it, except for the south-eastern side.

===Kaashidhu Atoll===
Kaashidhu Atoll, lies towards the eastern end of the channel to which it gives its name (&#x27;Kardiva Channel&#x27; in the Admiralty Chart). This atoll had two islands namely Kaashidhoo and Kaashidhoo Huraa from which only Kaashidhoo exists today. Kaashidhoo is surrounded by deep waters and there is generally heavy surf all around. The Atoll has an oval-shaped lagoon (vilu) with a narrow fringing reef on its NW side.

===Gahaafaru (Gaafaru) Atoll===
Gahaafaru Atoll also known as Gaafaru Atoll or Gaafarufalhu is a small atoll at the eastern end of a large elliptical reef that has proved disastrous to many vessels with the wrecks of Aracan (1873), SS Seagull (1879), Clan Alpine (1879), Erlangen (1894), Crusader (1905) and Lady Cristine (1974). long and wide Gaafaru reef is as much a separate atoll as Goidu or Rasdhu which are similar in structure and size. It is separated from Malé Atoll by a narrow but deep Gaafaru Kandu channel. Its lagoon has an average depth of 16 fathoms and has no coral patches or shoals in its centre.

===Male&#x27;atholhu Uthuruburi===
Male&#x27;atholhu Uthuruburi also known as North Malé Atoll is of irregular shape. It is long and contains about 50 islands (including the capital Malé). There are also sandbanks, coral patches, innumerable farus and submerged shoals (called &quot;haa&quot; in Dhivehi). The general depths of the interior are between 25 and 35 fathoms (46 to 64 m). The bottom is sandy. There are numerous passages on all sides. Seen from space it is considered one of the most beautiful atolls on the planet.

===Male&#x27;atholhu Dhekunuburi===
Male&#x27;atholhu Dhekunuburi also known as South Malé Atoll is separated from North Malé Atoll by a deep channel (Vaadhu Kandu). Oblong in shape, this atoll is in length. It contains 22 islands, all except for 5 are situated in its eastern fringes. Inside this atoll there are also many reefs and little coral patches which make navigation difficult. The general depths of the lagoon are from 25 to 32 fathoms (46 to 59 m), sandy bottom. South of the atoll lies the deep Fulidhoo Kandu.

===Thoddu Atoll===
Thoddu Atoll is a solitary round-shaped atoll located in deep waters at the western entrance of the Kardiva Channel. Its reef is steep and it lacks a lagoon.

===Rasdhu Atoll===
Rasdhu Atoll also known as Rasdhukuramathi Atoll (&#x27;Ross Atoll&#x27; in the Admiralty Chart) is a small atoll with an almost round lagoon. It is located almost from the NE point of Ari Atoll. The northern and western sides are one continuous barrier reef, and the eastern side is another. The lagoon has soundings from 15 to 20 fathoms (27 to 37 m) and abounds in detached coral patches.

===Ari Atoll===
Ari Atoll is the second westernmost atoll of the Maldives, only after Maamakunudhoo Atoll. It is oblong in shape, in length by only in breadth. It contains some 50 islands, generally small, which lie mainly along its eastern fringe. Its features are intermediate between Maalhosmadulhu and North Malé atolls. Except for a small barrier reef in its southern end, it is shaped by a succession of large, separate oval reefs, like the large atolls in the North, with a clear rim of large faru to the east. In the interior the general soundings are 30 to 40 fathoms (55 to 73 m), with mud and sand. In places its lagoon contains small reef-patches, but it is generally dotted with many large coral reefs, some of which remain submerged even at low tide.

===Felidhe Atoll===
Felidhe Atoll has a very irregular outline; it is surrounded by continuous barrier reefs, or by small patches with vilu separated by narrow passages. Felidhu Atoll has only 10 islands even though it is quite large. The Atoll’s western “horn” is devo westernmost point of this atoll (Fussaru) are dangerous for local navigation. Many ships plying along the route between Malé and the Southern Atolls, have been lost in these treacherous reefs. The distance between both points is . The inner lagoon is open with few reefs or shoals. Its general depth is of 40 fathoms (73 m); hard bottom of sand. The Atoll is also home the eastern most island and point of the Maldives.

===Vattaru Atoll (Falhu)===
Vattaru Atoll (Falhu) is an egg-shaped reef or small atoll about in length. It has only one small uninhabited bushy islet close to its only entrance in the south. The depth of its inner lagoon is between 12 and 20 fathoms (22 to 37 m) and its bottom is sandy.

===Mulaku Atoll===
Mulaku Atoll is a very shut-in atoll with an open lagoon surrounded by barrier reefs which are remarkably straight and broad in its western fringe. It is separated from the other Maldive atolls by the channels Vattaru Kandu in the north, Kudahuvadhoo Kandu in the south and the Hatharu-Atholhu Medu Kandu in the west. Mulaku Atoll is long and contains 21 islands, which lie mostly on its SE quarter. The shoals inside the lagoon are generally smaller than in the Northern atolls. There are many coral patches and the depth of the water varies from 28 to 40 fathoms (51 to 73 m); sandy bottom.

===Nilandhe Atholhu Uthuruburi===
Nilandhe Atholhu Uthuruburi (Northern Nilandhe Atoll) is long. It forms a perfect semicircle on the east, but its western side is rather indented. There are not many islands on its fringes. In the interior of its lagoon there are four islands and several large farus, dry at low tide. The average depth of its lagoon is 25 to 35 fathoms (55 to 64 m). The atoll is separated from Ari Atoll by the channel known as Ariadhoo Kandu.

===Nilandhe Atholhu Dhekunuburi===
Nilandhe Atholhu Dhekunuburi (Southern Nilandhe Atoll) is separated from Northern Nilandhe Atoll by a channel. It is larger than its northern neighbor, with a length of . It is separated from its northern sister atoll by the narrow channel called the Dheburudheetheree Kandu. Its shape is slightly oval, with some barrier reefs that are quite straight in the eastern fringe. There are 21 islands, but only two or three are on its western side. The lagoon is comparatively open, with few, but relatively greater farus as well as a few small coral patches or shoals (&quot;giri&quot;); average depth 27 to 35 fathoms (49 to 64 m), muddy bottom.

===Kolhumadulu===
The eastern and western rows of atolls that form Central Maldives end in Kolhumadulu Atoll south of the channel Kudahuvadhoo Kandu. It is mostly rimmed by barrier reefs which are topped by islands or deep pools (vilu). There are many islands along its southern boundary. Owing to its typical atoll shape, it differs in no respect from atolls in the Pacific Ocean, save for its greater size. The length of Kolhumadulhu Atoll is . The lagoon is comparatively open, although it is studded with numerous small coral patches or shoals which are awash at low tide. The general depth is from 32 to 42 fathoms (59 to 77 m) and it is mud-bottomed at the centre. South of the atoll lies the deep Veymandoo Kandu channel which separates it from the Hadhdhunmathee Atoll.

===Haddhunmathi===
Haddhunmathi Atoll ( &#x27;Haddummati&#x27; in the Admiralty Chart) is regular in shape and in length. Excepting for the projection of the reef at its NE corner (Isdhū Muli), it closely resembles Kolhumadulhu. Its reefs are generally of little breadth, with no signs of &quot;vilu&quot;, except for its eastern fringes which are covered with islands that are quite large by Maldive standards. The lagoon is comparatively open, containing scattered shoal patches and no emerged islands; the bottom is muddy and the average depth is from 30 to 34 fathoms (55 to 62 m).
===Medhuthila Atoll===
Medhuthila atoll is speculated to be a newly forming atoll of the Maldives between Haddhunmathi and Huvadhoo Atoll. There is currently not much research done about the atoll.

===Huvadhoo Atoll===
Huvadhoo Atoll ( &#x27;Huvadu Atoll&#x27; in the Admiralty Chart) measures from north to south, embracing an area of about 2,900 square km. Huvadhu Atoll is fringed by a well-defined and almost continuous rim-reef. The exterior islands, formed in general of coral boulders on their seaward side (futtaru) and sand on the reef’s inner face (etherevaru), are string along the east, south and SW sides of the atoll.
There are over 230 islands with 30 sandy islands in the centre of its lagoon, more than any other atoll of the Maldives. The stretch between the channels of Kaadedhoo Kandu and Fiyoaree Kandu alone has 77 islands, only 5 being inhabited and many unnamed. The atoll&#x27;s lagoon is open and very free from reef patches, although some precipitous shoals approach the surface. The lagoon bottom is covered with sand and has a maximum depth of 50 fathoms (91 m), being on average deeper than any other lagoon of the Maldive Atolls. It is a relatively isolated atoll with the Huvadhoo Kandu (Suvadiva Channel) to the north and the Addoo Kandu (South Equatorial Channel) to the south. This is the worlds 3rd largest atoll. Geographically from the number of islands and from the area this atoll is known as the world biggest atoll.

==== Guinness World Record ====
Huvadhu Atoll, located in the Maldives within the Indian Ocean, spans approximately 2,900 square kilometers (1,120 square miles) and encompasses around 255 islands within its confines. It holds the Guinness World Record for the atoll with the most number of islands in the World.

===Fuvahmulah===
Fuvahmulah (&#x27;Fua Mulaku&#x27; in the Admiralty Chart) is a large single island (by itself a small detached atoll) which lies in the Equatorial Channel. In the distant past Fuvahmulah was a small coral atoll whose southern end was open at a spot called Diyarehifaando and the inside of the island was a saltwater lagoon forming a natural harbour. There is a spot in the southern end known as a Kudhuheraivali (the forest of the small islet), which indicates that there was a separate little island in that area in ancient times. But long ago the channel connecting the lagoon with the ocean was closed by massive coral boulders. Thus the inside of the island is lower than its edges. In time the inner lagoon lost its saltiness and all that remains today are two small lakes, wetlands and marshy taro fields. Therefore, Fuvahmulah is a small Atoll that closed and filled in with silt, like Nukutavake in the Central Pacific.

===Addu Atoll===
Addu Atoll marks the southern end of the Maldive archipelago. Addu Atoll is long and it is fringed by broad barrier reefs with large islands on its eastern and western sides. Its lagoon has no islands and is relatively open with few shoals in its centre, but having mazes of coral patches close to the NW and NE corners of its encircling reefs in 7 to 10 fathoms (13 to 18 m) of water. The general depths vary from 20 to 25 fathoms (37 to 46 m), with mud and sand at the bottom.

The distance from Addu Atoll to the closest island in the Chagos Archipelago (Île Yeye, Peros Banhos Atoll) is about , with nothing but deep ocean in between them.

Note: Further south Haddhummati in the middle of the vast emptiness of the Huvadu Channel there is a small bank known as Medutila (also called Derahaa). This place is the peak of a submarine mountain, and perhaps an atoll in the process of formation. This bank is very difficult to spot for at its shallowest point there is a depth of 6 fathoms (11 m). It looks like a paler blue patch surrounded by huge expanses of the deepest ocean. There, no island can be seen in the horizon for many dozens of miles.

==Etymology of atoll names==
The names of the natural atolls of the Maldives are the names given to them by the first settlers of the country or the names derived from these. The atolls are usually named after islands that belong to the atoll and perhaps those that were the first sites of settlements in each atoll, or the main island of each atoll. The etymology of the names of the atolls can be traced as follows.
* Ihavandhippolhu Atoll- after the island of Ihavandhoo in the south east of the atoll.
* Thiladhunmati- after the island of Thiladhoo (now part of Dhiddhoo island).
* Māmakunudhoo- the major (&quot;mā&quot;) division to which the island of Makunudhoo belong to.
* Miladummadulu- after the island of Milandhoo on the eastern fringes of the atoll.
* Faadhippolhu- after Faadhoo island. Traditionally the name was &quot;Faadu Bur&quot; (that is, a complete circle from Fadhoo back to Faadhoo).
* Alifushi-Ethingili Atoll- after the islands of Alifushi and Ethingili, the only two islands in the atoll.
* The Maalhosmadulu Atolls- after the island of Maalhos, now in the southern atoll.
* Fasdhūtherē Atoll- literally means ‘what lies between the five islands’.
* Goifulhafehendhu Atoll- amalgamation of the names of the three inhabited islands of the atoll, Goidhoo, Fulhadhoo and Fehendhoo.
* The Male’ Atolls- after the island of Male’, the capital of the Maldives since 1117. It was previously called &quot;Biadhoo Atholhu&quot; named after the island of Biyadhoo in the southern atoll.
* Thoddoo Atoll- After Thoddoo island, the only island in the reef.
* Rasdhukuramathi Atoll- amalgamation of the names of the two largest islands of the atoll, Rasdhoo and Kuramathi.
* Ari Atoll- after Ariadhoo island, an important historic religious centre of the Maldives in the pre-Islamic era.
* Felidhu Atoll- after the island of Felidhoo, the capital of the atoll.
* Vattaru Atoll- Named after the only island in the reef, Vattaru, now in Vaavu Atoll. Also known as &quot;Falhu Atholhu&quot; Meaning &quot;Uninhabited Atoll&quot;, as it is the only atoll in The Maldives without an Inhabited Island,
* Mulaku Atoll- after the island of Boli Mulah, an important historic centre of the Maldives.
* The Nilandhe Atolls- after the island of Nilandhoo, now in the northern atoll and was an important historic religious centre of the Maldives in the pre-Islamic era.
* Kolhumadulu- meaning atoll at the end (&quot;kolhu&quot;) in reference to the end of the east-west divide of the Maldives Atolls between Kaashidhoo Kandu and Kudahuvadhoo Kandu.
* Haddhunmathi- from &quot;Ihadhunmathi&quot; meaning the first seen (&quot;iha&#x27;dhuh&quot;) part (&quot;mathi&quot;) or after the island of Ihadhoo (first island) that was located east of Isdhoo; this is believed to be the first region of the archipelago that was settled by the ancient Dheyvis people.
* Huvadhu Atoll- after the island of Keyhuvadhoo which was located between Hoandedhoo and the island of Hunigondiréhaa (few remains of the settlement such as coral wells can be seen on what is now a reef). The name &quot;Huvadhu&quot; itself means ‘the forbidden place’.
* Fuvahmulah- Areca nut (Fuvah in the local language) is a major product of this atoll or island in vast quantities from ancient times. The original name of the island could have simply been Mulah, but was called Fuvahmulah (the Mulah (island) of the arecanut palms) to distinguish it from Boli Mulah - another important island in ancient Maldives.
* Addu Atoll- after the island of Addu which was located south of Gan. The island of Addu was dredged off by the British in 1959 to construct the Gan airfield.

The few atoll names on the Admitralty charts that differ from their local Dhivehi names (namely Malcolm Atoll, Horsburg Atoll and Ross Atoll) were named by Robert Moresby in honor of famous commanders and officers of the British Empire, after the Moresby Cartographic Survey (1834–1836) of the Maldive Islands.

==Channels==

There are broad channels between the atolls known locally as &quot;kandu&quot;. These were important for ancient mariners plying along the spice route trying to bypass the long atoll chains without harm. The most important ones were the Maliku Kandu, the Kardiva Channel and the Suvadiva Channel.

There are other types of channel in the atolls. One is the channel into the atoll&#x27;s lagoon and the other is the passage on top of the reef into the vilu. These are very important for Maldivian sailors.

==Island environment==

The islands in the atolls of the Maldives rest on the shelf provided by the reefs. Many reefs have no islands at all, but all islands in the Maldives have an underlying coralline reef. Usually islands are flat and sandy. Often there is a rocky bottom made up of a coral rock conglomerate underneath the island proper. Some islands are long and sandy while others have a rounder shape. The round islands often are lower in the centre, sometimes having a muddy or marshy spot.

Islands may disappear when the currents on the reef change. Maldivians call this phenomenon of erosion &quot;giramun dhiyun&quot;. New islands also may appear, beginning as sandbanks or coral gravel heaps at another location of the reef (a phenomenon that is known among Maldivians as &quot;hikemun dhiyun&quot;). Therefore, in the Maldives, islands are constantly eroding and constantly being formed. Human action, in the form of jetties or the dredging of channels on the reef, may change the pattern of currents on the reef and accelerate erosion.

The atolls in Maldives are often separated from each other by vast expanses of the deepest ocean; but despite the great distances, the daily life of Maldivians in the individual inhabited islands shows very few differences all along the length of the atoll chain.

Except for the capital, Malé (pop. 90,000), the environment in most islands is dominated by practically the same small number of ingredients: trees of a few types, low houses with small yards, the waterside always close at hand and almost no dramatic variations in the landscape.
The Maldives has about 200 inhabited islands. The typical population is about 300 inhabitants per island, distributed in about fifty households.

==Neighboring island groups==
The Maldive atolls are part of the long submerged mountain range that extends from the Laccadives, or Lakshadweep, in the north, to the Chagos in the south. Northern Maldivians used to often visit Maliku, Minicoy Island, before the 1960s when it was allowed for them to do so. In fact, Minicoy was called &#x27;Avatteri Maliku&#x27;, which means &#x27;neighbor Maliku&#x27;. But even Northern Maldivians knew little about the Laccadive islands further north.

The Laccadives are different in structure from the Maldives. The most conspicuous fact is the absence of large atolls and the low density of reef and island structures. Most reefs have only one island on them.

In the south of Maldives the Chagos Archipelago is known as Hollhavai (&quot;Fōlhavahi&quot; in official Divehi). But even in these remote and strongly oceanic Southern Maldive atolls, knowledge about their neighboring island group is only vague and fragmentary.
The Chagos group is a combination of different coralline structures. Unlike in the Maldives there is not a clearly discernible pattern of arrayed atolls, which makes the whole archipelago look somewhat chaotic.

However, one of the atolls of the Chagos, Peros Banhos, is very similar in structure to the typical Maldive atoll. Although it is rather small by Maldive standards, it is the largest emerged atoll in the Chagos. Peros Banhos is approximately as large as Northern Nilandhe Atoll.

==Historic nomenclature==
The earliest mention of all the names of the atolls of the Maldives is in describing the &quot;Deeva Mahal&quot; Kingdom of King Koimala Siri Mahaabarana around 1117 A.D. He was the first king to rule over the whole of Maldives. His kingdom was referred to as being &quot;Malikaddu dhemedhu&quot;- or &#x27;all that lies between the Maliku and Addu. He fought against the Raja Dada Indians to claim the two northernmost atolls for the newly formed Maldivian kingdom. All 14 atolls of his kingdom from the north to south were then named as follows:
* Malikatholhu (now Minicoy island belonging to India)
* Thiladunmathi (Northern and southern parts of Thiladhunmathi Atoll)
* Miladunmaduva (Northern and southern parts of Miladhunmadulhu Atoll)
* Maalhosmaduva (North and South Maalhosmadulhu Atolls)
* Faadu Bur (Faadhippolhu)
* Mahal Atholhu (The Male&#x27; Atolls)
* Ari-adhe Atholhu (Ari Atoll)
* Felide Atholhu (Felide Atoll)
* Mulakatholhu (Mulaku Atoll)
* Nilande Atholhu (North and South Nilande Atolls)
* Kolhumaduva (Kolhumadulu)
* Ihadhunmathi (Haddhunmathi Atoll)
* Suvadinmathi (Huvadhu Atoll)
* Addumulah (Addu and Fuvahmulah Atolls)

It is not clear where exactly Ihavandhippolhu Atoll, Maamakunudhoo Atoll, Goifulhafehendhu Atoll, Fasdūtherē Atoll, Vattaru Faru/Atholhu, Gahaafaru Atoll, Rasdhukuramathi Atoll as well as the islands of Alifushi-Ethingili, Kaashidhoo and Thoddoo were grouped in this early classification.

==Recent divisions==
For administrative purposes, the country has been divided into twenty-one administrative divisions (20 administrative atolls and Malé city). Since these Administrative Divisions of the Maldives are called &#x27;atolls&#x27;, but are not always consisting of an atoll proper, they should not be confused with a natural atoll.

The introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name. Under such circumstances it is hard to know which is the correct name to use.

Aware of the extent of this problem, Maldivian expert Mr. Ibrahim Luthfee wrote a book on Maldivian geography before he died. With this book, the late Mr. Luthfee tried to clear a number of misconceptions that carelessly researched tourist publications have generalized even among Maldivians. Much of this article has been translated and adapted from his posthumous work.

In 2009 the 20 administrative divisions (that is, excluding Male&#x27;) were grouped under seven provinces, with each province comprising two or more natural atolls (with the exception of the Medhu-Dhekunu Province made up of solely Huvadhu Atoll). The seven new provinces correspond to the historic divisions of &quot;Uthuru Boduthiladhunmathi&quot;. &quot;Dhekunu Boduthiladhunmathi&quot;, &quot;Uthuru Medhu-Raajje&quot;, &quot;Medhu-Raajje&quot;, &quot;Dhekunu Medhu-Raajje&quot;, &quot;Huvadhu&quot; (or &quot;Uthuru Suvadinmathi&quot;) and &quot;Addumulakatholhu&quot; (or &quot;Dhekunu Suvadinmathi&quot;).

<text>Willich () is a town in the district of Viersen, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is 20 km west of Düsseldorf, 14 km north of Mönchengladbach, 10 km south of Krefeld, about 30 kilometres east of the border with the Netherlands and 45 km east of Roermond.

==History==
The city was founded in 1970 out of the formerly independent villages of Willich, Anrath, Schiefbahn and Neersen, although the villages are much older. Anrath was mentioned for the first time in 1010, Willich in 1245, Neersen in 1262 and Schiefbahn in 1420.

The villages belonged to the Electorate of Cologne until the French Revolutionary Wars: 
in 1794, French troops occupied the left bank of the Rhine; France annexed the territory later (1797/1801) and kept it until 1814. After the Battle of Waterloo (June 1815), the Congress of Vienna was held and the villages fell to the Kingdom of Prussia.

==1891–1945==
In 1891 a tornado devastated Anrath. The village was already impoverished by the decline of previously dominant domestic weaving and now the municipal administration of Anrath even considered a dissolution of the village. To improve the economic situation a royal prison was built. It was completed in 1905.

In 1908 &quot;Stahlwerk Becker&quot; (a steel mill) was built and up to its closing in 1932 (during the Great Depression) was one of the largest employers in Willich. After the Nazi seizure of power (30 January 1933), the steel mill got a new owner and was reopened in 1934. Military supplies (at first for the German rearmament and later for World War II) were manufactured there. The factory was finally closed in 1945 and the grounds were converted to a military base for the British Armed Forces.

During World War II, Willich suffered only minor damage to its infrastructure. During Operation Grenade on March 1, 1945, American forces which had entered Schiefbahn met a counterattack from a German Panzer unit. Heavy fighting erupted, with both sides suffering numerous casualties.

During the 19th century more than 100 Jews lived in the four villages. During the Third Reich, the Nazis deported 40 Jews – of whom 38 were ultimately murdered in the Nazi death camps.

==British Army==
The British Army of the Rhine had soldiers stationed in Willich for more than 40 years: 40 Army Engineer Support Regiment (40 AESR), which by the early 1980s was reduced down to 40 Army Engineer Support Group (40 AESG). Both units belonged to the Royal Engineers. In 1992 the camp was closed and the group disbanded. In July 2009 a reunion took place in the old camp. 141 attended the evening event. There was a reunion again in 2012 with over 200 joining in the complete weekend.

==Economy==
Some international companies, especially from the Far East, have their European or German headquarters in Willich.

==Transportation==

===Streets===
There is an Interchange between Bundesautobahn 44 and Bundesautobahn 52 motorways within the municipal area of Willich. 
In the area there are five junctions.

===Railway===
The railway station in Anrath is on the railway between Duisburg and Mönchengladbach.

==Notable places==

===Schloss Neersen===

The most famous building is Schloss Neersen. The castle goes back to the 13th century and was heavily rebuilt in the 17th century. It now houses many town council offices. An open-air summer theatre is held in the grounds.

===Klein-Jerusalem chapel===
A moderately well-known pilgrimage destination is the 17th century Klein-Jerusalem wayside chapel.

===Anrath Prison===
The former royal prison in Anrath is now a federal state prison named Justizvollzugsanstalt Willich.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Willich is twinned with:
* Linselles, France
* Marugame, Japan
* Smiltene, Latvia
* Zogoré, Burkina Faso

<text>Sydney Trains is the operator of commuter rail services centred on the Sydney rail network. Sydney Trains is owned and operated by Transport for NSW, a statutory authority of the Government of New South Wales.

The Sydney Trains network comprises seven metropolitan lines with services extending as far as Berowra to the north, Richmond to the north-west, Emu Plains to the west, Waterfall to the south (with some peak hour services continuing to Helensburgh), and Macarthur to the south west.

Most of the Sydney Trains network runs on the surface of suburban areas while some more recently constructed and inner city sections run underground. The network is served by a fleet of double-deck electric multiple units.

<doc id="537248" wikidata="Q769843" url="?curid=537248" title="Mehndi">
<text>Mehndi () is a form of temporary skin decoration using a paste created with henna. In the West, mehndi is commonly known as henna tattoo, although it is not a permanent tattoo. 

Mehndi is a popular form of body art in South Asia and resembles similar traditions of henna as body art found in North Africa, East Africa and the Middle East. There are many different names for mehndi across the languages of South Asia. 

There are many different designs and forms of mehndi, often known as henna. For celebrations, women traditionally apply mehndi to their hands and feet, however some people, such as cancer sufferers and women with alopecia, may also decide to adorn their scalps. Rich brown is the most popular henna color, which is produced using a natural dye made from the Lawsonia inermis plant. But modern patterns now incorporate hues like white, red, black, and gold, enabling more individualized and varied artistic expressions.

In South Asia, mehndi is applied on the body during both Hindu and Muslim weddings. Hindu women apply mehndi during festivals like Karva Chauth, Vat Purnima, Diwali, Bhai Dooj, Navratri, Durga Puja, and Teej. Muslim women apply mehndi during occasions like Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.

At Hindu and Sikh festivals, women often have henna applied to their hands, feet and sometimes the backs of their shoulders. Conversely, men usually have it applied on their arms, legs, back, and chest. For women, it is usually drawn on their palms, backs of their hands and on feet, where the design will be clearest due to contrast with the lighter skin on these surfaces, which naturally contains less of the pigment melanin.

==Etymology==
The origin of &quot;mehndi&quot; is from the Sanskrit word &quot;mendhika,&quot; which refers to the henna plant that releases a red dye. According to &quot;A Dictionary of Urdu, Classical Hindi and English,&quot; mehndi also refers to &quot;the marriage-feast on the occasion of the bride&#x27;s hands and feet being stained with henna.&quot;

==Origins==
Earliest use of henna dye can be traced back to ancient Babylon and Egypt. In 6th century Arabia, its use was well known and used in medicine, overlapping with certain pagan customs in the same historical and cultural context as Islam. In India, it was in use by the 4th century CE, which is evidenced by the cave arts of Deccan region.. However, it likely became prevalent around the 12th century CE, aided by the rise of Islam in the subcontinent. 

==Process==
The paste is made from the powdered dry leaves of the henna plant, &quot;Lawsonia inermis&quot;. 

Mehndi paste is usually applied to the skin using a plastic cone, a paintbrush, or a stick. Fifteen to twenty minutes after application, the mud will dry and begin to crack. The painted area is then wrapped with tissue, plastic, or medical tape to lock in body heat, creating a more intense colour on the skin. The wrap, which is not a traditional method, is worn for two to six hours, or sometimes overnight, and then removed. 

When first removed, the henna design is pale to dark orange in colour and gradually darkens through oxidation, over the course of 24 to 72 hours. The final color is reddish brown and can last anywhere from one to three weeks depending on the quality and type of henna paste applied, as well as where it was applied on the body (thicker skin stains darker and longer than thin skin).

Likely due to the desire for a &quot;tattoo-black&quot; appearance, some people add the synthetic dye p-phenylenediamine (PPD) to henna to give it a black colour. PPD may cause moderate to severe allergic reactions when applied to skin.

==Usage==
Mehndi is a ceremonial art form common in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan. It is typically applied during weddings for Sikh, Muslim and Hindu brides. In Rajasthan, the grooms are given designs that are often as elaborate as those for brides. In Assam, apart from marriage, it is broadly used by unmarried women during Rongali Bihu.

Among South Asian Muslims, mehndi is a common tradition for brides as well as other girls on weddings. It is also done for Eid on Chaand Raat. There are professionals as well for this while other people do this by their own.

==Popular mehndi patterns==
===Arabic mehndi designs===
This pattern is drawn on the palm. Generally, it starts from one corner of the wrist and ends at finger tip on the opposite corner. Vine, lace, and flowers are the main elements of this pattern.

===Mandala mehndi designs===
Mandala is a geometric configuration of symbols used in various spiritual traditions including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Shinto. Various configurations of Mandala are drawn on the center of palm in this mehndi pattern.

<text>Agapius () was a Christian martyr killed at Caesarea in AD 306. He is recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church. His martyrdom is recorded by Eusebius of Caesarea in his work &quot;The Martyrs of Palestine&quot;.

==History==
Agapius succeeded Theotecnus as bishop of Caesarea Maritima. He was arrested in AD 304. He remained in prison for two years and was tortured on multiple occasions. He was brought out to the arena many times and presented to the judges. There he was threatened and reserved for later matches. The judges, Eusebius notes, must have been motivated either out of compassion or the hope that he might change his mind and renounce Christianity.

Finally he was brought to the arena and presented to the emperor Maximinus. He was offered a pardon on the condition that he disavow his faith. According to Eusebius, he not only refused the offer, but he is said to have cheerfully rushed headlong into the bear. The animal inflicted severe injuries, but Agapius survived. Stones were affixed to his feet and he was drowned in the Mediterranean on the following day. 

His feast days are observed on November 20 and August 19.

<doc id="537250" wikidata="Q44237" url="?curid=537250" title="Mendoza, Argentina">
<text>Mendoza (), officially the City of Mendoza (), is the capital of the province of Mendoza in Argentina. It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the Andes. As of the , Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making Greater Mendoza the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.

Ruta Nacional 7, the major road running between Buenos Aires and Santiago, runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to Aconcagua (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for adventure travelers interested in mountaineering, hiking, horse riding, rafting, and other sports. In the winter, skiers come to the city for easy access to the Andes.

Two of the main industries of the Mendoza area are olive oil production and Argentine wine. The region around Greater Mendoza is the largest wine-producing area in South America. As such, Mendoza is one of the eleven Great Wine Capitals, and the city is an emerging enotourism destination and base for exploring the region&#x27;s hundreds of wineries located along the Argentina Wine Route.

== History ==

On 2 March 1561, Pedro del Castillo founded the city and named it &quot;Ciudad de Mendoza del Nuevo Valle de La Rioja&quot; after the governor of Chile, Don García Hurtado de Mendoza. Before the 1560s the area was populated by tribes known as the Huarpes and Puelches. The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches (acequias), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.

It is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the Jesuit presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with Buenos Aires, Viceroyalty on which it depended since its creation and transfer from the Captaincy General of Chile in 1776, no doubt led to the creation of the state of Cuyo in 1813 with José de San Martín as governor. It was from Mendoza that San Martín and other Argentinian and Chilean patriots organized the army with which they won the independence of Chile and Peru.
Mendoza suffered a severe earthquake in 1861 that killed at least 5,000 people. The city was rebuilt, incorporating innovative urban designs that would better tolerate such seismic activity. Mendoza was rebuilt with large squares and wider streets and sidewalks than any other city in Argentina. Avenue Bartolomé Mitre and additional small squares are examples of that design.

Tourism, wine production, and more recently the exploitation of commodities such as oil and uranium ensure Mendoza&#x27;s status as a key regional centre. Important suburbs such as Godoy Cruz, Guaymallén, Las Heras and Luján de Cuyo have in recent decades far outpaced the city proper in population. Comprising half the metro population of 212,000 in 1947, these suburbs grew to nearly seven-eighths of the total metro area of over 1,000,000 by 2015, making Mendoza the most dispersed metro area in Argentina.

==Culture==
Mendoza has several museums, including the Museo Cornelio Moyano, a natural history museum, and the Museo del Área Fundacional (Historical Regional Foundation Museum) on Pedro del Castillo Square. The Museo Nacional del Vino (National Wine Museum), focusing on the history of winemaking in the area, is southeast of Mendoza in Maipú. The Casa de Fader, a historic house museum, is an 1890 mansion once home to artist Fernando Fader in nearby Mayor Drummond, south of Mendoza. The mansion is home to many of the artist&#x27;s paintings.

The Fiesta Nacional de la Vendimia (The National Grape Harvest Festival) occurs in early March each year. Part of the festivities include a beauty pageant, where 17 beauty queens from each department of Mendoza Province compete, and one winner is selected by a panel of about 50 judges. The queen of Mendoza city&#x27;s department does not compete and acts as host for the other queens.

In 2008, &quot;National Geographic&quot; listed Mendoza as one of the top 10 historic destinations in the world.

== Urban structure ==
The city is centred around Plaza Independencia (Independence Plaza) with Avenida Sarmiento running through its centre east–west, with the east side pedestrianized (peatonal). Other major streets, running perpendicular to Sarmiento, include Bartolomé Mitre, San Martín, and 9 de Julio (9 July), those running parallel include Colón, and Las Heras. Four smaller plazas, San Martín, Chile, Italia, and España, are located 2 blocks off each corner of Independence Plaza. Unique to Mendoza are the exposed stone ditches, essentially small canals, which run alongside many of the roads supplying water to the thousands of trees.

Parque General San Martín (General San Martín Park) was designed by Carlos Thays. Its grounds include the Mendoza Zoological Park and a football stadium, and it is also the home of the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. A view of the city is available from the top of Cerro de la Gloria (Mt. Glory).

One common point of interest is the Teatro Independencia (&quot;Independence Theatre&quot;), the premier performing arts venue in Mendoza. Supervised by the nation&#x27;s Ministry of Public Works, the project was commissioned to architect Alfredo Israel, and its plans were approved in October 1923. The theatre was, as were many public works of this type in Argentina at the time, designed in a French Academy style. Its façade included a Neoclassical frontis featuring four Corinthian columns on a green marble base, a rococo frieze, the provincial escutcheon in bas-relief, and a balustrade above. The design for the interiors was based on those prevailing in Italian opera houses, and the formal vestibule is overlooked by grand marble steps leading to the concert hall. The auditorium itself includes four tiers of balconies, and its seating capacity is 730. The theatre serves as the home of the Provincial Philharmonic Orchestra. In addition, the theatre has received international personalities such as Erlend Øye and John Malkovich.

==Education==
Mendoza has a number of universities, including the major Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, as well as University of Mendoza, a branch of Universidad Congreso, Aconcagua University, UTN (Universidad Tecnologica Nacional) and Champagnat University.

Mendoza is a popular place to learn Spanish, and there are a number of Spanish language schools, including Intercultural, Green Fields and SIMA.

==Transportation==

Mendoza is from Buenos Aires (14 hours by bus) and from Santiago, Chile (6–7 hours by bus). Gov. Francisco Gabrielli International Airport serves Mendoza, with flights to/from Buenos Aires taking less than 2 hours and less than 1 hour to/from Santiago.

The public transport system includes buses, the Mendoza trolleybus system, and taxis. The trolleybuses are more comfortable than the diesel buses, but are slower, not as numerous nor is the system as extensive. In 2008, TransLink of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, sold most of its old trolleybus fleet to Mendoza.

A heritage railway, El Tren del Vino (The Wine Train), is being planned which will also provide local transportation; it will run through wine-producing districts of Mendoza.

=== Metrotranvía ===
A light rail line, the Metrotranvía Mendoza, opened for regular service in October 2012. It serves the areas of Las Heras, Godoy Cruz and Maipú in the Greater Mendoza conurbation, as well as the central area of Mendoza itself. The line runs from &quot;Avellaneda station&quot; in the Panquehua neighborhood of Las Heras to &quot;Gutiérrez&quot; in Maipú, stopping also at the Mendoza Railway Station at the site of the former intercity passenger train station, near the city centre. The bright red railcars, Siemens-Duewag U2s, were purchased from the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) in 2010. They were built in 1980.

=== Transandine Railway ===
Mendoza&#x27;s development was helped partly due to its position at the start of the Transandine Railway linking it to Santa Rosa de Los Andes in Chile. The only railway operable between Argentina and Chile, after many years of inactivity, it remains currently abandoned.

The railway is a line, with sections of Abt rack, whilst the railways it links with are both broad gauge. A journey from Buenos Aires to Chile involved two breaks-of-gauge, and therefore two changes of train, one at Mendoza, and the other at Santa Rosa de Los Andes.

==Wine industry==

Argentina&#x27;s Malbec wines originate from Mendoza&#x27;s high-altitude wine regions of Lujan de Cuyo and the Uco Valley. These districts are located in the foothills of the Andes mountains between 2,800 and 5,000 feet elevation.
Vintner Nicolas Catena Zapata is considered the pioneer of high-altitude growing and was the first, in 1994, to plant a malbec vineyard at 5,000 feet above sea level in the Mendoza region. His family is also credited with making world-class wines and giving status to the wines of Argentina.

The subject of elevation is of much interest to the wine world because with increased altitude, the intensity of the sunlight increases. The role of this increased light intensity is currently being investigated by Catena Zapata&#x27;s research and development department headed up by Laura Catena, Alejandro Vigil and Fernando Buscema.

==In media==
&quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, directed by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud and starring Brad Pitt, was shot in and around Mendoza. Several dozens of sets were built, ranging from a long recreation of the Tibetan capital city of Lhasa (built in the foothills of the Andes), to a recreation of the Hall of Good Deeds in the Potala, the ancient palace of the Dalai Lama (built in an abandoned garlic warehouse outside the city).

Mendoza appears as the penultimate level of the 2021 video game &quot;Hitman 3&quot;. It contains hints of Argentine culture, such as mate, tango, and wine production.

==Climate==
Mendoza&#x27;s climate is characterised as an arid (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWk&quot;); with continental characteristics. Most precipitation in Mendoza falls in the summer months (November–March). Summers are hot and humid where mean temperatures exceed . Average temperatures for January (summer) are during daytime, and at night. Winters are cold and dry with mean temperatures below . Night time temperatures can occasionally fall below freezing during the winter. Because winters are dry with little precipitation, snowfall is uncommon, occurring once per year. July (winter) the average temperatures are and , day and night respectively. Mendoza&#x27;s annual rainfall is only , so extensive farming is made possible by irrigation from major rivers. The highest temperature recorded was on 30 January 2003, This previous record was surpassed by the new temperature record of recorded on 16 December 2023, while the lowest temperature recorded was on 10 July 1976.


==Sports==

In 1978 Mendoza hosted six matches of the 1978 FIFA World Cup. The six were played at the Malvinas Argentinas Stadium.

In 1982, Mendoza was one of the hosts of the 1982 FIVB Men&#x27;s Volleyball World Championship. It was also the host of the 1994 Padel World Championship.

The city boasts multiple significant football clubs—Independiente Rivadavia currently plays in the Primera División, the top flight of Argentine football, while Gimnasia y Esgrima de Mendoza plays in the second division. A club from the nearby city of Godoy Cruz, Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba, is also currently in the firsgst division.

International rugby test matches featuring the Argentina national rugby team have also been held in Mendoza.

<text>Curvilinear perspective, also five-point perspective, is a graphical projection used to draw 3D objects on 2D surfaces, for which (straight) lines on the 3D object are projected to curves on the 2D surface that are typically not straight (hence the qualifier &quot;curvilinear&quot;). It was formally codified in 1968 by the artists and art historians André Barre and Albert Flocon in the book &quot;La Perspective curviligne&quot;, which was translated into English in 1987 as &quot;Curvilinear Perspective: From Visual Space to the Constructed Image&quot; and published by the University of California Press.

Curvilinear perspective is sometimes colloquially called fisheye perspective, by analogy to a fisheye lens. In computer animation and motion graphics, it may also be called tiny planet.

== History ==

An early example of approximated five-point curvilinear perspective is within the &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot; (1434) by the Flemish Primitive Jan van Eyck. Later examples may be found in mannerist painter Parmigianino Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror (c. 1524) and &quot;A View of Delft&quot; (1652) by the Dutch Golden Age painter Carel Fabritius.

In 1959, Flocon had acquired a copy of &quot;Grafiek en tekeningen&quot; by M. C. Escher who strongly impressed him with his use of bent and curved perspective, which influenced the theory Flocon and Barre were developing. They started a long correspondence, in which Escher called Flocon a &quot;kindred spirit&quot;.

== Horizon and vanishing points ==

The system uses both curved perspective lines and an array of straight converging ones to approximate the image on the retina of the eye, which is itself spherical, more accurately than the traditional linear perspective, which only uses straight lines but is very distorted at the edges.

It uses either four, five or more vanishing points:

*In five-point (fisheye) perspective: Four vanishing points are placed around in a circle, they are named N, W, S, E, plus one vanishing point in the center of the circle.
*Four, or infinite-point perspective is the one that (arguably) most approximates the perspective of the human eye, while at the same time being effective for making impossible spaces, while five point is the curvilinear equivalent of one point perspective, so is four point the equivalent of two point perspective.

This technique can, like two-point perspective, use a vertical line as a horizon line, creating both a worms and birds eye view at the same time. It uses four or more points equally spaced along a horizon line, all vertical lines are made perpendicular to the horizon line, while orthogonals are created using a compass set on a line made at a 90-degree angle through each of the four vanishing points.

==Geometric relationship==

Distances a and c between the viewer and the wall are greater than the b distance, so adopting the principle that when an object is a greater distance from the observer, it becomes smaller, the wall is reduced and thus appears distorted at the edges.

==Mathematics==

If a point has the 3D Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;):

:formula_1

Denoting distance from the point to the origin by &quot;d&quot; = ,

then the transformation of the point to a curvilinear reference system of radius &quot;R&quot; is

:formula_2 
(if &quot;d&quot; = 0, then the point is at the origin, which means its projection is undefined)

This is derived by first projecting the 3D point onto a sphere with radius &quot;R&quot; that centers on the origin, so that we obtain an image of the point that has coordinates

:formula_3

Then, we do a parallel projection that is parallel with the &quot;z&quot;-axis to project the point on the sphere onto the paper at &quot;z&quot; = &quot;R&quot;, thus obtaining

:formula_4

Since we are not concerned with the fact that the paper is resting on the &quot;z&quot; = &quot;R&quot; plane, we ignore the &quot;z&quot;-coordinate of the image point, thus obtaining

:formula_5

Since changing formula_6 only amounts to a scaling, it is usually defined to be unity, simplifying the formula further to:

:formula_7

A line that does not pass through the origin is projected to a great circle on the sphere, which is further projected to an ellipse on the plane. The ellipse has the property that its long axis is a diameter of the &quot;bounding circle&quot;.
