<text>A subpoena duces tecum (pronounced in English ), or subpoena for production of evidence, is a court summons ordering the recipient to appear before the court and produce documents or other tangible evidence for use at a hearing or trial. In some jurisdictions, it can also be issued by legislative bodies such as county boards of supervisors.

The summons is known by various names in different jurisdictions. The term &quot;subpoena duces tecum&quot; is used in the United States, and some other common law jurisdictions such as South Africa and Canada. The summons is called a &quot;subpoena for production of evidence&quot; in some U.S. states that have sought to reduce the use of non-English words and phrases in court terminology.

The &quot;subpoena duces tecum&quot; is similar to the &quot;subpoena ad testificandum&quot;, which is a writ summoning a witness to testify orally. However, unlike the latter summons, the &quot;subpoena duces tecum&quot; instructs the witness to bring in hand books, papers, or evidence for the court. In most jurisdictions, a subpoena usually has to be served personally.

==Etymology==
The phrase &quot;sub poena duces tecum&quot; is a Latin expression meaning literally &quot;under [threat of] penalty [or punishment], you will bring [it] with you.&quot; The word means &quot;under&quot; and &quot;penalty&quot;; &quot;you will lead, guide, pull, bring&quot;; and &quot;with you&quot;.

==Order pursuant to a deposition==
In the United States, a notice to a party deponent (a person called to testify in a deposition) may be accompanied by a request for production of documents and other tangible things during the taking of a deposition. The notice to produce (literally: &quot;bring these documents with you to the deposition&quot;) is served prior to the deposition. This follows the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The method of using a subpoena duces tecum is generally valid only to compel a witness to produce documents and other things at the time of the deposition. If a deponent is a non-party to the action (not involved directly in the litigation, but wanted for testimony), production of documents can be compelled only through a proper subpoena duces tecum.

Federal cases and some states follow Rule 27(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure concerning the production of documents in pretrial discovery, including those pertaining to depositions. These can include the subpoena duces tecum to produce documents, or in some cases to undergo a physical or mental examination. In the Ninth Circuit, interpreting Rule 27 literally, it has been held that a party can simply produce the documents only, and in certain cases, avoid an oral deposition when presented with a subpoena duces tecum.

==Failure to produce documents==
A continuance (a rescheduling of a court hearing at a later date) of a civil action may be granted due to the absence of documents or papers. The party failing to produce the documents requested by a subpoena duces tecum must show good reason why there was a failure to do so. Acceptable explanations have included loss or destruction of papers, or an agreement to use copies. The party seeking the continuance must show that the absence of the documents is not because of the negligence of their own, or of the attorney of record.

Similarly, a continuance may be granted in a criminal case if there is good reason documents pertinent to the case could not be produced at the time of trial. For example, a continuance should be granted for failure to produce a transcript of testimony given at a previous trial. In general, it is reversible error to proceed with a criminal trial in the absence of a previous trial transcript, when such contains pertinent information that should have been considered in the new trial. In these cases, a continuance is the usual remedy.

==Jencks Act cases==
In the 1957 case &quot;Jencks v. United States&quot; the United States Supreme Court ruled that a defendant must have access to government witnesses who will testify against him in a criminal trial, and must also have access to any documents pertaining to that testimony. This includes papers, documents, written statements and the like. This led to passage of the Jencks Act, 18 USC, Part II, Chapter 223, § 3500, which allows for &quot;subpoena duces tecum&quot; of relevant government documents, but only after a government agent or employee has testified at trial. There can be no pre-trial discovery. The subpoena is allowed by the trial judge. The government has the right to deny access to the documents. This may be due to the sensitive nature of the documents, or because they are classified.

If a remedy is granted, there is a mistrial and dismissal of criminal charges. An accused criminal has no right to subpoena the work product of the prosecution in a criminal case.

==Writ of mandamus==
A writ of mandamus (Latin for &quot;we command&quot;) is appropriate to compel surrender of documents in the possession of attorneys or other persons that have been illegally obtained under the abuse of a writ of attachment. Mandamus can vacate an order to produce books and papers.

In an 1893 case, the United States Attorney for Alabama refused to vacate his office, refusing to surrender books, papers and other materials to the newly appointed US Attorney. The federal court in Alabama issued a writ directing the previous attorney to relinquish the documents. He, in turn, sought relief from the Supreme Court, which denied his application, saying it would not interfere with the properly conducted internal matters of a court. In the case &quot;In re: Parsons&quot;, the US Supreme Court wrote: &quot;If the orders be regarded merely as directions in the administration of judicial affairs in respect of the immediate possession of property or custody of prisoners, we cannot be properly called to, by reason of anything appearing on these records, in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in this manner, to direct them to be set aside. And if the proceedings should be treated as involving a final determination as on issues joined to the right to such possession and custody, there was no complaint of want of notice or of hearing, and the summary made adopted did not in itself affect the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court upon the ground that it had exceeded its powers.&quot;

Mandamus is the remedy where a lower court has clearly failed to issue compulsion to produce documents, or to allow the petitioner access to such documents as may be in the possession of the court or the parties to the action. Mandamus can be used to compel a court to enforce an order to answer interrogatories (questions submitted by the court or one of the parties to be answered under oath and pain of perjury).

Mandamus is the proper remedy to compel the quashing of a subpoena duces tecum for the production before a grand jury of documents protected by attorney–client privilege. Presumably, this would apply to attorney work product, although there is no case law on the matter.

==Commitment of witness; contempt of court==
A witness who has refused to obey a lawful order to produce books, documents and papers may be incarcerated for contempt of court. A writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; will not apply unless it can be shown the witness could not have legally had possession of such documents. In such a situation the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; will properly apply, and is the remedy for such improper action.

At common law, and under various statutes pertaining to a given jurisdiction, a right to action for damages, or for a statutory penalty or forfeiture, exists against a witness who, without sufficient excuse, fails or refuses to give oral testimony or to produce documents or other specified items in obedience to the command of a properly issued and served subpoena.

There are certain conditions precedent, or defenses, to a recovery of damages for a person&#x27;s failure to testify, or to provide documents pertinent to a hearing or trial. There must be a breach of testimonial duty, after having been properly served with a legitimately executed subpoena. There must be a demonstration of actual damages incurred from the absence of testimony. Most courts have rejected the arguments for seeking damages in this kind of case. Giving false testimony in a judicial proceeding even though the allegation is made that the person giving the testimony knew it to be false, does not give rise, either at common law or by statute, to a civil action for damages resulting from such testimony. The situation is probably different if intentionally false documents are submitted under a &quot;subpoena duces tecum&quot;.

==Privileges==
Attorney–client privilege is generally recognized by the courts. Communications between lawyer and client are generally immune from subpoena. In other words, a lawyer cannot be compelled to testify in a trial unless the lawyer becomes, or appears to become, a party to the litigation. A similar situation exists with &quot;work product&quot;, meaning written documents or computer records generated in preparation for a trial or hearing. This includes information such as potential questions that may be asked of witnesses, lists of possible witnesses, memoranda, notes, trial strategies, written briefs, or documents that may, or may not end up being used in the course of litigation. Usually, none of this can be the subject of a subpoena duces tecum. If a communication between lawyer and client is made in the presence of the third party, the privilege is not recognized to exist.

The federal courts will apply the common law rule of attorney–client privilege unless there is an intervening state law applying to the central issues of the matter. In those cases, the federal court uses the effective state law.

Physician–patient privilege is usually statutorily defined, and can vary from state to state. The usual rule is that medical records are immune from subpoena if the plaintiff has not alleged physical or mental injuries or damages. Once the plaintiff alleges physical or mental injuries proximately flowing from a potentially tortious act by the defendant, or in some other disability hearing, medical records can be subject to &quot;subpoena duces tecum&quot;. While witnesses may try to resist legal discovery by asking the judge to protect them from questioning or inspection of documents, the policy of the courts is in favor of full disclosure. It is the intent of the rules of procedure that pre-trial discovery take place without any intervention of a judge. So-called &quot;fishing expeditions&quot; (massive and aimless calls for all documents related to the litigation) are permissible under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (b) (1). This rule is repeated in many states&#x27; rules of procedure: &quot;Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant ... if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.&quot; The looseness of the definition of relevant evidence is generally construed to mean &quot;liberal&quot; production. The physician who is the party to an action does not own the records of patients he has treated. They are not privileged if the patient has waived confidentiality. Physicians must produce medical records under &quot;subpoena duces tecum&quot;.

Peer review records, and other hospital documents of quality control committee meetings are generally not subject to &quot;subpoena duces tecum&quot;, since these have statutory immunity. The theory is that the frankness of peer review would be chilled if these records could be routinely compelled.

Several United States Federal Circuit Courts have recognized a limited reporter&#x27;s privilege.

In some states (such as California), rape crisis counselors and domestic violence advocates hold a statutory privilege analogous to therapist–client privilege. (See, for example, 1035 Cal. Evidence Code for rape crisis advocates, and 1037.6 Cal. Evidence Code for domestic violence advocates).

==Pre- and post-judgment execution proceedings==
Discovery can be authorized for the production of documents for both pre-trial and post-trial actions. Most states either follow, or have modeled their procedures after, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 69(a).

Judgment creditors (those who have received a favorable court ruling for monetary damages) are permitted to ask questions about a debtor&#x27;s residence; recent employment history; business relationships, including partners, co-shareholders, co-officers, co-directors; the contents of a will; transfers of property; and the identity of persons who either owed a debt to the judgment debtor, or received things of value from the debtor. Information in bank accounts can also be the subject of a subpoena duces tecum.

In federal court proceedings concerning judgment debtors, the inquiry is usually limited to the discovery of assets. In international cases, being tried in United States Federal Courts, the application of the Hague Service Convention is utilized where appropriate.

==Public access to documents filed with the court==
The right of the public to access judicial records is fundamental to a democratic state and is analogous to the United States&#x27; First Amendment right of freedom of speech and of the press and the Sixth Amendment right to public trials. While the right to access trial records is not absolute, it is framed in presumption of public access to the proceedings and records. United States Code 11, Section 107 (a), of the federal bankruptcy law, is a codification of the common-law general right to inspect judicial records and documents. However, the right is not absolute and may be denied when the entity seeking to view the records has an improper purpose. The general intent of the statute is to favor public access to court documents.

==Production of documents in bankruptcy==
An entity (person or a corporation) may be compelled to produce documentary evidence in accordance with the subpoena powers of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45 as applied by Bankruptcy Rule 9016. The United States Bankruptcy Court has powers to compel production of documents from a non-debtor corporation or person concerning transactions involving the debtor corporation or person. Production of documents can be challenged as being burdensome. Assets diverted to outside corporations or bank accounts/stock portfolios and such other assets as land holdings lie within the power to compel production under subpoena duces tecum. Federal law recognizes no accountant-client privilege. A subpoena duce tecum served pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2004 is not a violation of accountant-client privilege. 11 United States Code section 107 (a) provides that papers filed in cases under the Bankruptcy Code and dockets of the Bankruptcy Courts are public records and are to be open to examination at reasonable times without charge.

==Compelling a foreign corporation to produce documents==
A domestic corporation may be considered to be a &quot;person&quot; within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. It is not necessary to treat a corporation as a person in all circumstances. United States case law is confusing concerning this matter when dealing with foreign corporations, and their operation within the United States. Especially troubling have been rulings concerning the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A foreign agent may not claim Fifth Amendment provisions against self-incrimination. Nor can records be withheld from subpoena duces tecum on the grounds that production of such documents would incriminate officers or other members of the foreign corporation. However, there is case authority in which foreign corporations have been protected from illegal searches and seizures, including documents and books. The matter of a foreign corporation operating as a &quot;person&quot; within the United States being afforded protection under the Fourteenth Amendment is discussed.

==Subpoena of welfare documents==
Statutes governing the disclosure of information contained in welfare records exist in many jurisdictions. The rationale for the existence of these regulations is to encourage full and frank disclosure by the welfare recipient of his situation and the protection of the recipient from the embarrassment likely to result from the disclosure of information contained in such records. In some states, records can be disclosed at the discretion of the state director of welfare. In general, welfare records are not public records, and should not be considered to be such. Disclosure of information is usually limited to purposes directly connected with the administration of welfare benefits. The investigation of costs of welfare programs have been held to be sufficiently related to the matters in question to justify disclosure. Statutes designed to limit welfare record availability are generally held by the courts to be not immune from the power of subpoena duces tecum.
Certain state laws limit the availability of information that can be obtained from the subpoena of such documents. These are always subject to a court challenge, on a case-by-case basis. Welfare recipients are generally allowed access to their files, by subpoena duces tecum. Death of a welfare recipient is considered in some states to be sufficient reason to remove the reason for confidentiality. Some states have passed so-called &quot;Right to Know&quot; statutes, which would make welfare recipients and the information available to the public. These, along with common law, and state and federal constitutions guaranteeing freedom of the press do not give newspapers (or other news media) the right to access the names of persons on welfare, or the amounts they receive.

==Federal Trade Commission hearings in monopoly actions==
Whenever the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has reason to believe that any person has violated 15 USC section 13, 14, 18 or 19, it must issue and serve on that person and on the Attorney General of the United States, a complaint stating its charges in that regard. The notice shall also give a date for a hearing in the matter. Delivery of the subpoena duces tecum for production of documents may be done in person, or by certified letter. Receipt of the letter is considered proof of service.

Power to issue subpoenas is extended to Robinson–Patman Act cases of price-fixing and Clayton Act cases of unlawful acquisition.

A Federal District Court lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the Federal Trade Commission from proceeding in an investigation. It cannot stay (stop) a subpoena duces tecum to produce documents in the investigative stage. An injunction by a federal court does not have the power to restrain the FTC from enforcing an order requiring corporations to furnish reports and documents un 15 USC § 49. The only relief available to stop a demand for documents is to seek an action of compliance in mandamus by the Attorney General of the United States, or under 15 USC § 50 to enforce fines and forfeitures.

If the FTC institutes an adjudicative proceeding (a hearing), the person who originated the matter by complaining to the FTC is not a party to the action and does not have any control over it. The FTC may allow the complaining person to participate in the proceeding by virtue of 15 USC, section 45. This allows participation for good cause, either by counsel (lawyer) or in person. You cannot intervene in an FTC hearing, except by demonstrating that substantial issues of law or fact would not be properly raised and argued—and that these issues are important and immediate enough to warrant additional expenditure of FTC resources. This involvement can be enhanced by subpoena duces tecum.

Pre-hearing conferences are the norm. These are useful in:
* Clarifying or simplifying issues
* Amending pleadings
* Entering stipulations, admissions of fact, and contents and authenticity of documents
* Expediting discovery and presentation of evidence, including restriction of witnesses
* Matters subject to official notice that may be resolved by further production of documents related to the case
In general, pre-hearing conferences are not public. The FTC is not restricted by a rigid rule of evidence.

==Subpoena of medical records==

===Administrative law===
Disabled persons under the age of 65 years can be eligible for disability benefits under Social Security Titles II and XVI.

The seminal case in Social Security law is Richardson v. Perales, a Supreme Court decision from 1971. The court directed that medical reports put forth by a treating physician in Social Security hearings should be accepted as evidence, despite the hearsay nature of the medical records. These should be accepted, even if cross-examination is not available. The claimant has the right to subpoena the treating physician. In cases of conflicting medical evidence, it is not unconstitutional for the hearing officer to obtain independent medical advice to help resolve the physical questions involved. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, hearsay in the form of medical records are admissible up to the point of relevancy.

Several federal agencies have adopted Jencks Act rules. Although the Jencks Act applies only to government agents or employees who testify in criminal cases, making these witnesses and relevant documents available for cross-examination after testimony, it has been applied in administrative law cases in the interests of justice and fair play. The party of record must make an official request to the hearing officer to have Jencks rules followed. Some agency rules, such as National Labor Relations Board automatically follow Jencks Act requirements.

===Medical malpractice actions===
In a case of alleged negligence by a physician, written summaries of the case by physicians provided to the insurance carrier or other parties can be the subject of a subpoena duces tecum, if, in the opinion of the court, they are relevant to the plaintiff&#x27;s case. Claims that these statements are &quot;work product&quot; will generally fail.

Medical records form the core of any medical malpractice case. Actions for malpractice are controlled by the general rules of evidence in civil procedure. A malpractice action necessarily involves the question of requisite care and skill applied in a medical case. With the exception of res ipsa loquitur cases, medical opinion about the care is essential. This involves the necessity to obtain a subpoena duces tecum for medical records.

Admission of &quot;learned treatises&quot; (published books and medical articles) at trial varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Some require that the expert admit it is an authoritative reference. Others will allow admission of learned treatises by judicial notice.

===Experts and opinion evidence===
In tort actions for recovery of damages, it is necessary for the introduction of medical records to establish a basis for the claimed loss. An injured plaintiff is entitled to recover the expenses necessary to cure or treat injuries. Courts frequently call upon expert testimony to interpret and advise, after examining medical records concerning the nature of injuries, future medical, disability and other issues before the court.

===Worker&#x27;s Compensation actions===
Medical records introduced as evidence are crucial in determining both causation and impairment in worker&#x27;s compensation cases. In cases where the evidence is contested, medical evidence in the form of records, opinions, affidavits and testimony concerning both fact and opinion is necessary. When oral testimony is taken from physicians, the usual standard is to state an opinion &quot;within a reasonable degree of medical certainty&quot;. Worker&#x27;s compensation laws are dictated by state statute or Federal Employers Liability Act. In many states, the employer has the right to demand an independent examination and can also direct treatment be carried out by certain physicians.

===Mandatory reporting of child abuse===
In the landmark 1976 California case of &quot;Landeros v. Flood&quot;, the California Supreme Court remanded a case to the trial court for action in tort against a treating physician for failure to report suspected child abuse. The theory at trial was that the plaintiff, a child of about 12 months of age, had been returned to a home where further physical abuse occurred, causing more damages. This was because the physician had failed to report the abuse in violation of California law. After this case, all states instituted mandatory reporting by physicians and other medical personnel of any suspected child abuse or neglect cases. In general, reporting in good faith shields the physician or health care worker from tort liability. Reporting to police or social services necessitates obtaining medical records by subpoena duces tecum. This case, and legislation that followed it were in response to several articles that appeared in the medical literature that defined &quot;battered child syndrome&quot; and &quot;child abuse syndrome&quot;.

The 1962 Social Security Amendments require each state to make child welfare services available throughout the state to all children and provide coordination between child welfare services (Title IV-B) and social services provided under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Act (ADC, later known as AFDC; now called Title XX) Determinations in these cases frequently require production of medical records.

In 1972, Congressional hearings began on child abuse and neglect. In response, Congress passed the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, which defined abuse as &quot;physical or mental injury, negligent treatment, or maltreatment of a child under the age of 18 by a person who is responsible for the child&#x27;s welfare under circumstances which would indicate that the child&#x27;s health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby&quot;. The legislation created the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect as an information clearinghouse.

The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1974 ( – ) defined &quot;child abuse and neglect&quot; as &quot;physical or mental injury, sexual abuse, negligent treatment, or maltreatment of a child under the age of eighteen by a person responsible for the child&#x27;s welfare under circumstances which indicate that the child&#x27;s health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby.&quot;

The Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1988 when enacted, expanded the definition of abuse. Sexual crimes were specifically identified in Sex Crimes Against Children Act of 1995 These laws have made child abuse a federal crime, and routinely mandate production of medical records.

===Mandatory reporting of wounds and injuries===
Physician-patient privilege is defined and limited by statute. Many jurisdictions have mandatory reporting laws requiring treating physicians or other medical personnel to report any suspicious injury to police or other appropriate authorities. These requirements may be imposed by statute, ordinance or regulation. Some of these may be limited to wounds typically inflicted by gun or knife. There may be similar reporting requirements in cases of domestic violence. These statutes have been generally upheld to constitutional challenges. Reporting of such cases usually voids any challenge to subpoena duces tecum of the medical records by police or state authorities.

===Peer review records in medical licensing and hospital credential actions===
The issue of removal of a doctor from a hospital staff, or revoking or limiting a license to practice medicine usually involve various state and federal immunities. The Healthcare Quality Improvement Act (HCQIA) of 1986 granted doctors sitting on peer review committees immunity from subpoena duces tecum, or liability for the revocation of hospital privileges of other doctors. The matters of peer review cannot, in the normal course of events, be the subject of a subpoena duces tecum. This has led to claims that powerful doctors can abuse the process to punish other doctors for reasons unrelated to medical issues (termed &quot;sham peer review&quot;).

The American Medical Association conducted a probe of the sham peer review issue and found that no pervasive problem exists. Allegations of sham peer review are easy to make (for example, by doctors whose medical mistakes have made them targets of peer review), but actual infractions are rare. Opponents of peer review counter that the sparcity of successful challenges is indicative of how widespread the problem is and how difficult these actions are to win.

<text>BioJava is an open-source software project dedicated to provide Java tools to process biological data. BioJava is a set of library functions written in the programming language Java for manipulating sequences, protein structures, file parsers, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) interoperability, Distributed Annotation System (DAS), access to AceDB, dynamic programming, and simple statistical routines. BioJava supports a range of data, starting from DNA and protein sequences to the level of 3D protein structures. The BioJava libraries are useful for automating many daily and mundane bioinformatics tasks such as to parsing a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file, interacting with Jmol and many more. This application programming interface (API) provides various file parsers, data models and algorithms to facilitate working with the standard data formats and enables rapid application development and analysis.

Additional projects from BioJava include rcsb-sequenceviewer, biojava-http, biojava-spark, and rcsb-viewers.

==Features==
BioJava provides software modules for many of the typical tasks of bioinformatics programming. These include:

* Accessing nucleotide and peptide sequence data from local and remote databases
* Transforming formats of database/ file records
* Protein structure parsing and manipulation
* Manipulating individual sequences
* Searching for similar sequences
* Creating and manipulating sequence alignments

== History and publications==
The BioJava project grew out of work by Thomas Down and Matthew Pocock to create an API to simplify development of Java-based Bioinformatics tools. BioJava is an active open source project that has been developed over more than 12 years and by more than 60 developers. BioJava is one of a number of Bio* projects designed to reduce code duplication. Examples of such projects that fall under Bio* apart from BioJava are BioPython, BioPerl, BioRuby, EMBOSS etc.

In October 2012, the first paper on BioJava was published. This paper detailed BioJava&#x27;s modules, functionalities, and purpose.

As of November 2018 Google Scholar counts more than 130 citations.

The most recent paper on BioJava was written in February 2017. This paper detailed a new tool named BioJava-ModFinder. This tool can be used for identification and subsequent mapping of protein modifications to 3D in the Protein Data Bank (PBD). The package was also integrated with the RCSB PDB web application and added protein modification annotations to the sequence diagram and structure display. More than 30,000 structures with protein modifications were identified by using BioJava-ModFinder and can be found on the RCSB PDB website.

In the year 2008, BioJava&#x27;s first Application note was published. It was migrated from its original CVS repository to GitHub in April 2013. The project has been moved to a separate repository, BioJava-legacy, and is still maintained for minor changes and bug fixes.

Version 3 was released in December 2010. It was a major update to the prior versions. The aim of this release was to rewrite BioJava so that it could be modularized into small, reusable components. This allowed developers to contribute more easily and reduced dependencies. The new approach seen in BioJava 3 was modeled after the Apache Commons.

Version 4 was released in January 2015. This version brought many new features and improvements to the packages biojava-core, biojava-structure, biojava-structure-gui, biojava-phylo, as well as others. BioJava 4.2.0 was the first release to be available using Maven from the Maven Central.

Version 5 was released in March 2018. This represents a major milestone for the project. BioJava 5.0.0 is the first released based on Java 8 which introduces the use of lambda functions and streaming API calls. There were also major changes to biojava-structure module. Also, the previous data models for macro-molecular structures have been adapted to more closely represent the mmCIF data model. This was the first release in over two years. Some of the other improvements include optimizations in the biojava-structure module to improve symmetry detection and added support for MMTF formats. Other general improvements include Javadoc updates, dependency versions, and all tests are now Junit4. The release contains 1,170 commits from 19 contributors.

==Modules==
During 2014-2015, large parts of the original code base were rewritten. BioJava 3 is a clear departure from the version 1 series. It now consists of several independent modules built using an automation tool called Apache Maven. These modules provide state-of-the-art tools for protein structure comparison, pairwise and multiple sequence alignments, working with DNA and protein sequences, analysis of amino acid properties, detecting protein modifications, predicting disordered regions in proteins, and parsers for common file formats using a biologically meaningful data model. The original code has been moved into a separate BioJava legacy project, which is still available for backward compatibility.

BioJava 5 introduced new features to two modules, biojava-alignment and biojava-structure.

The following sections will describe several of the new modules and highlight
some of the new features that are included in the latest version of BioJava.
===Core Module===
This module provides Java classes to model amino acid or nucleotide sequences. The classes were designed so that the names are familiar and make sense to biologists and also provide a concrete representation of the steps in going from a gene sequence to a protein sequence for computer scientists and programmers.

A major change between the legacy BioJava project and BioJava3 lies in the way framework has been designed to exploit then-new innovations in Java. A sequence is defined as a generic interface allowing the rest of the modules to create any utility that operates on all sequences. Specific classes for common sequences such as DNA and proteins have been defined in order to improve usability for biologists. The translation engine really leverages this work by allowing conversions between DNA, RNA and amino acid sequences. This engine can handle details such as choosing the codon table, converting start codons to methionine, trimming stop codons, specifying the reading frame and handing ambiguous sequences.

Special attention has been paid to designing the storage of sequences to minimize space needs. Special design patterns such as the Proxy pattern allowed the developers to create the framework such that sequences can be stored in memory, fetched on demand from a web service such as UniProt, or read from a FASTA file as needed. The latter two approaches save memory by not loading sequence data until it is referenced in the application. This concept can be extended to handle very large genomic datasets, such as NCBI GenBank or a proprietary database.

===Protein structure modules===

The protein structure modules provide tools to represent and manipulate 3D biomolecular structures. They focus on protein structure comparison.

The following algorithms have been implemented and included in BioJava.
* FATCAT algorithm for flexible and rigid body alignment.
* The standard Combinatorial Extension (CE) algorithm.
* A new version of CE that can detect circular permutations in proteins.
These algorithms are used to provide the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) Protein Comparison Tool as well as systematic comparisons of all proteins in the PDB on a weekly basis.

Parsers for PDB and mmCIF file formats allow the loading of structure data into a reusable data model. This feature is used by the SIFTS project to map between UniProt sequences and PDB structures. Information from the RCSB PDB can be dynamically fetched without the need to manually download data. For visualization, an interface to the 3D viewer Jmol is provided.

===Genome and Sequencing modules===

This module is focused on the creation of gene sequence objects from the core module. This is realized by supporting the parsing of the following popular standard file formats generated by open source gene prediction applications:
* GTF files generated by GeneMark
* GFF2 files generated by GeneID
* GFF3 files generated by Glimmer
Then the gene sequence objects are written out as a GFF3 format and is imported into GMOD.
These file formats are well defined but what gets written in the file is very flexible.

For providing input-output support for several common variants of the FASTQ file format from the next generation sequencers, a separate sequencing module is provided. For samples on how to use this module please go to this link.

===Alignment module===
This module contains several classes and methods that allow users to perform pairwise and multiple sequence alignment. Sequences can be aligned in both a single and multi-threaded fashion. BioJava implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for optimal global alignments and the Smith and Waterman&#x27;s algorithm for local alignments.
The outputs of both local and global alignments are available in standard formats. In addition to these two algorithms, there is an implementation of Guan–Uberbacher algorithm which performs global sequence alignment very efficiently since it only uses linear memory.

For Multiple Sequence Alignment, any of the methods discussed above can be used to progressively perform a multiple sequence alignment.

===ModFinder module===

The ModFinder module provides new methods to identify and classify protein modifications in protein 3D structures. Over 400 different types of protein modifications such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, disulfide bonds metal chelation etc. were collected and curated based on annotations in PSI-MOD, RESID and RCSB PDB. The module also provides an API for detecting pre-, co-, and post-translational protein modifications within protein structures. This module can also identify phosphorylation and print all pre-loaded modifications from a structure.

===Amino acid properties module===
This module attempts to provide accurate physio-chemical properties of proteins.
The properties that can calculated using this module are as follows:
*Molecular mass
*Extinction coefficient
*Instability index
*Aliphatic index
*Grand average of hydropathy
*Isoelectric point
*Amino acid composition

The precise molecular weights for common isotopically labelled amino acids are included in this module. There also exists flexibility to define new amino acid molecules with their molecular weights using simple XML configuration files. This can be useful where the precise mass is of high importance such as mass spectrometry experiments.

===Protein disorder module===
The goal of this module is to provide users ways to find disorders in protein molecules. BioJava includes a Java implementation of the RONN predictor. The BioJava 3.0.5 makes use of Java&#x27;s support for multithreading to improve performance by up to 3.2 times, on a modern quad-core machine, as compared to the legacy C implementation.

There are two ways to use this module:
*Using library function calls
*Using command line

Some features of this module include:

* Calculating the probability of disorder for every residue in a sequence
* Calculating the probability of disorder for every residue in the sequence for all proteins from a FASTA input file
* Get the disordered regions of the protein for a single protein sequence or for all the proteins from a FASTA input file

===Web service access module===
As per the current trends in bioinformatics, web based tools are gaining popularity. The web service module allows bioinformatics services to be accessed using REST protocols. Currently, two services are implemented: NCBI Blast through the Blast URLAPI (previously known as QBlast) and the HMMER web service.

== Comparisons with other alternatives ==
The need for customized software in the field of bioinformatics has been addressed by several groups and individuals. Similar to BioJava, open-source software projects such as BioPerl, BioPython, and BioRuby all provide tool-kits with multiple functionality that make it easier to create customized pipelines or analysis.

As the names suggest, the projects mentioned above use different programming languages. All of these APIs offer similar tools so on what criteria should one base their choice? For programmers who are experienced in only one of these languages, the choice is straightforward. However, for a well-rounded bioinformaticist who knows all of these languages and wants to choose the best language for a job, the choice can be made based on the following guidelines given by a software review done on the Bio* tool-kits.

In general, for small programs (&lt;500 lines) that will be used by only an individual or small group, it is hard to beat Perl and BioPerl. These constraints probably cover the needs of 90 per cent of personal bioinformatics programming.

For beginners, and for writing larger programs in the Bio domain, especially those to be shared and supported by others, Python’s clarity and brevity make it very attractive.

For those who might be leaning towards a career in bioinformatics and who want to learn only one language, Java has the widest general programming support, very good support in the Bio domain with BioJava, and is now the de facto language of business (the new COBOL, for better or worse).

Apart from these Bio* projects there is another project called STRAP which uses Java and aims for similar goals. The STRAP-toolbox, similar to BioJava is also a Java-toolkit for the design of Bioinformatics programs and scripts. The similarities and differences between BioJava and STRAP are as follows:

Similarities
* Both provide comprehensive collections of methods for protein sequences.
* Both are used by Java programmers to code bioinformatics algorithms.
* Both separate implementations and definitions by using java interfaces.
* Both are open source projects.
* Both can read and write many sequence file formats.

Differences
* BioJava is applicable to nucleotide and peptide sequences and can be applied for entire genomes. STRAP cannot cope with single sequences as long as an entire chromosome. Instead STRAP manipulates peptide sequences and 3D- structures of the size of single proteins. Nevertheless, it can hold a high number of sequences and structures in memory. STRAP is designed for protein sequences but can read coding nucleotide files, which are then translated to peptide sequences.
* STRAP is very fast since the graphical user interface must be highly responsive. BioJava is used where speed is less critical.
* BioJava is well designed in terms of type safety, ontology and object design. BioJava uses objects for sequences, annotations and sequence positions. Even single amino acids or nucleotides are object references. To enhance speed, STRAP avoids frequent object instantiations and invocation of non-final object-methods.
**In BioJava peptide sequences and nucleotide sequences are lists of symbols. The symbols can be retrieved one after the other with an iterator or sub-sequences can be obtained. The advantages are that the entire sequence does not necessarily reside in memory and that programs are less susceptible to programming errors. &quot;Symbol&quot; objects are immutable elements of an alphabet. In STRAP however simple byte arrays are used for sequences and float arrays for coordinates. Besides speed the low memory consumption is an important advantage of basic data types. Classes in Strap expose internal data. Therefore, programmers might commit programming errors like manipulating byte arrays directly instead of using the setter methods. Another disadvantage is that no checks are performed in STRAP whether the characters in sequences are valid with respect to an underlying alphabet.
**In BioJava sequence positions are realized by the class &quot;Location&quot;. Discontiguous &quot;Location&quot; objects are composed of several contiguous &quot;RangeLocation&quot; objects or &quot;PointLocation&quot; objects. For the class &quot;StrapProtein&quot; however, single residue positions are indicated by integer numbers between 0 and &quot;countResidues()-1&quot;. Multiple positions are given by boolean arrays. True at a given index means selected whereas false means not selected.
* BioJava throws exceptions when methods are invoked with invalid parameters. STRAP avoids the time-consuming creation of Throwable objects. Instead, errors in methods are indicated by the return values NaN, -1 or null. From the point of program design however &quot;Throwable&quot; objects are nicer.
* In BioJava a &quot;Sequence&quot; object is either a peptide sequence or a nucleotide sequence. A StrapProtein can hold both at the same time if a coding nucleotide sequence was read and translated into protein. Both, the nucleotide sequence and the peptide sequence are contained in the same StrapProtein object. The coding or non-coding regions can be changed and the peptide sequence alters accordingly.

<text>Emmanuel Uwechue, known by his stage name Brother Hao () is a Nigerian singer. He rose to fame through a performance with Han Hong on the &quot;CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala&quot; and has emerged as one of the most notable foreign singers in China.

==Career==
Uwechue began his singing career in the choir at House on the Rock Pentecostal Church in Lagos, Nigeria. He received a degree in engineering, and began to pursue a singing career, which led his father to disown him. Before getting his career off the ground in China, he was a country music singer. In 2001, a friend advised Uwechue to move to Beijing, where he started performing at bars and hotels. At the Big Easy Bar in Beijing in 2006, he was discovered by Liu Huan, a well-known music producer, who helped him learn Mandarin Chinese. In the same year, he participated in the TV show Xing Guang Da Dao.

In 2011, a video of Uwechue singing the Mao-era patriotic song Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China was posted on YouTube. It became a viral video, and helped to increase his fame on the Internet both within and outside China.

<text>BioPerl is a collection of Perl modules that facilitate the development of Perl scripts for bioinformatics applications. It has played an integral role in the Human Genome Project.

==Background==

BioPerl is an active open source software project supported by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation. The first set of Perl codes of BioPerl was created by Tim Hubbard and Jong Bhak at MRC Centre Cambridge, where the first genome sequencing was carried out by Fred Sanger. MRC Centre was one of the hubs and birthplaces of modern bioinformatics as it had a large quantity of DNA sequences and 3D protein structures. Hubbard was using the codice_1 Perl library, which contained many useful Perl subroutines for bioinformatics. Bhak, Hubbard&#x27;s first PhD student, created codice_2. Bhak merged the two Perl subroutine libraries into codice_3. The name BioPerl was coined jointly by Bhak and Steven Brenner at the Centre for Protein Engineering (CPE). In 1995, Brenner organized a BioPerl session at the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference, held in Cambridge. BioPerl had some users in coming months including Georg Fuellen who organized a training course in Germany. Fuellen&#x27;s colleagues and students greatly extended BioPerl; this was further expanded by others, including Steve Chervitz who was actively developing Perl codes for his yeast genome database. The major expansion came when Cambridge student Ewan Birney joined the development team.

The first stable release was on 11 June 2002; the most recent stable (in terms of API) release is 1.7.2 from 7 September 2017. There are also developer releases produced periodically. Version series 1.7.x is considered to be the most stable (in terms of bugs) version of BioPerl and is recommended for everyday use.

In order to take advantage of BioPerl, the user needs a basic understanding of the Perl programming language including an understanding of how to use Perl references, modules, objects, and methods.

==Features and examples==
BioPerl provides software modules for many of the typical tasks of bioinformatics programming. These include:

* Accessing nucleotide and peptide sequence data from local and remote databases
Example of accessing GenBank to retrieve a sequence:

* Transforming formats of database/ file records
Example code for transforming formats

* Manipulating individual sequences
Example of gathering statistics for a given sequence

* Searching for similar sequences
* Creating and manipulating sequence alignments
* Searching for genes and other structures on genomic DNA
* Developing machine-readable sequence annotations

==Usage==
In addition to being used directly by end-users, BioPerl has also provided the base for a wide variety of bioinformatic tools, including amongst others:

* SynBrowse
* GeneComber
* TFBS
* MIMOX
* BioParser
* Degenerate primer design
* Querying the public databases
* Current Comparative Table

New tools and algorithms from external developers are often integrated directly into BioPerl itself:

* Dealing with phylogenetic trees and nested taxa
* FPC Web tools

==Advantages==
BioPerl was one of the first biological module repositories that increased its usability. It has very easy to install modules, along with a flexible global repository. BioPerl uses good test modules for a large variety of processes.

==Disadvantages==
There are many ways to use BioPerl, from simple scripting to very complex object programming. This makes the language not clear and sometimes hard to understand. For as many modules that BioPerl has, some do not always work the way they are intended.

==Related libraries in other programming languages==
Several related bioinformatics libraries implemented in other programming languages exist as part of the Open Bioinformatics Foundation, including:
* Biopython
* BioJava
* BioRuby
* BioPHP
* BioJS
* Bioconductor

<text>In Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, the Sanskrit term Bīja () (Jp. 種子 shuji) (Chinese 種子 zhǒng zǐ), literally seed, is used as a metaphor for the origin or cause of things and cognate with bindu. 
==Buddhist theory of karmic seeds==
Various schools of Buddhist thought held that karmic effects arose out of seeds that were latent in an individual&#x27;s mindstream or psycho-physical continuum. Rupert Gethin describes the theory thus:

When I perform an action motivated by greed, it plants a &#x27;seed&#x27; in the series of dharmas [phenomena] that is my mind. Such a seed is not a thing in itself - a dharma but merely the modification or &#x27;perfuming&#x27; of the subsequent flow of dharmas consequent upon the action. In the course of time this modification matures and issues in a particular result, in the same way as a seed does not produce its fruit immediately, but only after the &#x27;modifications&#x27; of the shoot, stem, leaf, and flower. 

The Sautrantika school held such a theory as did the Mahasamghikas and the early Mahasisakas. The Sautrantika Sthavira Srilata held a conception of &quot;subsidiary element&quot; (&quot;anudhatu&quot; or *&quot;purvanudhatu&quot;) which also corresponds to this theory of seeds. The seed theory was defended by the Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu in his Abhidharmakosha who mentions that is the view of the “old teachers” (&quot;purvacarya&quot;). It is also present in the &quot;Viniscayasamgrahani&quot; of the Yogacarabhumi. In the Bashyam Vasubandhu connects the Sautrantika theory of seeds with the notion of the latent defilements or anusaya:

The Sautrantikas define anusayas as kleshas in the state of seeds and say that they are not separate dravyas (substances). Anusayas are dormant, i.e., not actualized, while paryavasthanas (active defilements) are awakened.

Likewise, the &quot;Nyayanusara&quot; of Sanghabhadra states that the theory had different terms to refer to &quot;seeds&quot;:

There are certain masters who give different names to these seeds, each according to his own understanding. Some call them subsidiary elements (&quot;anudhatu&quot;), others call them impressions (&quot;vasana&quot;); still others call them capability (&quot;samarthya&quot;), non-disappearance (&quot;avipranasa&quot;), or accumulation (&quot;upacaya&quot;).
The theory is considerably extended in the Consciousness-only teachings of the Yogacara school of Buddhism. According to this theory, all experiences and actions produce &quot;bīja&quot; as impressions, stored in the alaya (storehouse) consciousness. The external world is produced when the seeds &quot;perfume&quot; this consciousness.

==As Mantras==

In Vajrayana Buddhism and Hinduism, the term &quot;bīja&quot; is used for mystical &quot;seed syllables&quot; contained within mantras or standalone seed syllable mantras (bijamantra). These seeds do not have specific linguistic meaning nor are they name mantras, but they may stand for specific principles, deities, powers, or ideas.

The best-known &quot;bīja&quot; syllable is Om, first found in the Hindu scriptures the Upanishads. In Buddhism, the most important seed syllable is the letter A bija.

In some tantric traditions, the Bija of the &#x27;Varnamala&#x27; (Sanskrit; English: &quot;garland of letters&quot;; which may be rendered as alphabet) are understood as aniconic representations and sound embodiments of the matrikas (a group of goddesses).

In Tibetan Buddhism the seed syllables corresponding to the trikaya are: a white &quot;oṃ&quot; (enlightened body), a red &quot;āḥ&quot; (enlightened speech) and a blue &quot;hūṃ&quot; (enlightened mind).

In the Bön tradition of Tibet, it&#x27;s a little different: a white &quot;āḥ&quot;, a red &quot;oṃ&quot; and a blue &quot;hūṃ&quot;.

Bijas are often the vehicle of esoteric transmission of terma to a &#x27;tertön&#x27; (Tibetan; English: &quot;revealer of terma&quot;), such as that experienced by Dudjom Lingpa.

==Cross-cultural correlates==
Guruwari of the Indigenous Australian peoples is an interesting cross cultural correlate and may be cognate. See also gankyil of the Vajrayana tradition which is cognate with bindu. In the respected fieldwork published in &quot;Aboriginal Men of High Degree&quot;, A.P. Elkin cites what he in his professional opinion is evidence that traders from Indonesia brought fleeting contact of Buddhism and Hinduism to areas near modern-day Dampier. Traditions of Mantrayana were also evident in Indonesia, e.g. Candi Sukuh. And it is in the Vajrayana and Mantrayana traditions of esoteric transmission where bija take precedence. Indeed, bija defines Mantrayana. Elkin interpreted a link between Indigenous Australian culture and Buddhist ideas such as reincarnation. He argued this link could have been brought through contact with Macassan traders.

<text>The Biopython project is an open-source collection of non-commercial Python tools for computational biology and bioinformatics, created by an international association of developers. It contains classes to represent biological sequences and sequence annotations, and it is able to read and write to a variety of file formats. It also allows for a programmatic means of accessing online databases of biological information, such as those at NCBI. Separate modules extend Biopython&#x27;s capabilities to sequence alignment, protein structure, population genetics, phylogenetics, sequence motifs, and machine learning. Biopython is one of a number of Bio* projects designed to reduce code duplication in computational biology.

== History ==

Biopython development began in 1999 and it was first released in July 2000. It was developed during a similar time frame and with analogous goals to other projects that added bioinformatics capabilities to their respective programming languages, including BioPerl, BioRuby and BioJava. Early developers on the project included Jeff Chang, Andrew Dalke and Brad Chapman, though over 100 people have made contributions to date. In 2007, a similar Python project, namely PyCogent, was established.

The initial scope of Biopython involved accessing, indexing and processing biological sequence files. While this is still a major focus, over the following years added modules have extended its functionality to cover additional areas of biology (see Key features and examples).

As of version 1.77, Biopython no longer supports Python 2.

== Design ==
Wherever possible, Biopython follows the conventions used by the Python programming language to make it easier for users familiar with Python. For example, codice_1 and codice_2 objects can be manipulated via slicing, in a manner similar to Python&#x27;s strings and lists. It is also designed to be functionally similar to other Bio* projects, such as BioPerl.

Biopython is able to read and write most common file formats for each of its functional areas, and its license is permissive and compatible with most other software licenses, which allow Biopython to be used in a variety of software projects.

== Key features and examples ==

=== Sequences ===
A core concept in Biopython is the biological sequence, and this is represented by the codice_1 class. A Biopython codice_1 object is similar to a Python string in many respects: it supports the Python slice notation, can be concatenated with other sequences and is immutable. In addition, it includes sequence-specific methods and specifies the particular biological alphabet used.
»&gt; # This script creates a DNA sequence and performs some typical manipulations
»&gt; from Bio.Seq import Seq
»&gt; dna_sequence = Seq(&quot;AGGCTTCTCGTA&quot;, IUPAC.unambiguous_dna)
»&gt; dna_sequence
Seq(&#x27;AGGCTTCTCGTA&#x27;, IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
»&gt; dna_sequence[2:7]
Seq(&#x27;GCTTC&#x27;, IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
»&gt; dna_sequence.reverse_complement()
Seq(&#x27;TACGAGAAGCCT&#x27;, IUPACUnambiguousDNA())
»&gt; rna_sequence = dna_sequence.transcribe()
»&gt; rna_sequence
Seq(&#x27;AGGCUUCUCGUA&#x27;, IUPACUnambiguousRNA())
»&gt; rna_sequence.translate()
Seq(&#x27;RLLV&#x27;, IUPACProtein())
=== Sequence annotation ===
The codice_2 class describes sequences, along with information such as name, description and features in the form of codice_6 objects. Each codice_6 object specifies the type of the feature and its location. Feature types can be ‘gene’, ‘CDS’ (coding sequence), ‘repeat_region’, ‘mobile_element’ or others, and the position of features in the sequence can be exact or approximate.
»&gt; # This script loads an annotated sequence from file and views some of its contents.
»&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
»&gt; seq_record = SeqIO.read(&quot;pTC2.gb&quot;, &quot;genbank&quot;)
»&gt; seq_record.name
&#x27;NC_019375&#x27;
»&gt; seq_record.description
&#x27;Providencia stuartii plasmid pTC2, complete sequence.&#x27;
»&gt; seq_record.features[14]
SeqFeature(FeatureLocation(ExactPosition(4516), ExactPosition(5336), strand=1), type=&#x27;mobile_element&#x27;)
»&gt; seq_record.seq
Seq(&quot;GGATTGAATATAACCGACGTGACTGTTACATTTAGGTGGCTAAACCCGTCAAGC...GCC&quot;, IUPACAmbiguousDNA())
=== Input and output ===
Biopython can read and write to a number of common sequence formats, including FASTA, FASTQ, GenBank, Clustal, PHYLIP and NEXUS. When reading files, descriptive information in the file is used to populate the members of Biopython classes, such as codice_2. This allows records of one file format to be converted into others.

Very large sequence files can exceed a computer&#x27;s memory resources, so Biopython provides various options for accessing records in large files. They can be loaded entirely into memory in Python data structures, such as lists or dictionaries, providing fast access at the cost of memory usage. Alternatively, the files can be read from disk as needed, with slower performance but lower memory requirements.
»&gt; # This script loads a file containing multiple sequences and saves each one in a different format.
»&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
»&gt; genomes = SeqIO.parse(&quot;salmonella.gb&quot;, &quot;genbank&quot;)
»&gt; for genome in genomes:
... SeqIO.write(genome, genome.id + &quot;.fasta&quot;, &quot;fasta&quot;)
=== Accessing online databases ===

Through the Bio.Entrez module, users of Biopython can download biological data from NCBI databases. Each of the functions provided by the Entrez search engine is available through functions in this module, including searching for and downloading records.
»&gt; # This script downloads genomes from the NCBI Nucleotide database and saves them in a FASTA file.
»&gt; from Bio import Entrez
»&gt; from Bio import SeqIO
»&gt; output_file = open(&quot;all_records.fasta&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)
»&gt; Entrez.email = &quot;my_email@example.com&quot;
»&gt; records_to_download = [&quot;FO834906.1&quot;, &quot;FO203501.1&quot;]
»&gt; for record_id in records_to_download:
... handle = Entrez.efetch(db=&quot;nucleotide&quot;, id=record_id, rettype=&quot;gb&quot;)
... seqRecord = SeqIO.read(handle, format=&quot;gb&quot;)
... handle.close()
... output_file.write(seqRecord.format(&quot;fasta&quot;))
=== Phylogeny ===

The Bio.Phylo module provides tools for working with and visualising phylogenetic trees. A variety of file formats are supported for reading and writing, including Newick, NEXUS and phyloXML. Common tree manipulations and traversals are supported via the codice_9 and codice_10 objects. Examples include converting and collating tree files, extracting subsets from a tree, changing a tree&#x27;s root, and analysing branch features such as length or score.

Rooted trees can be drawn in ASCII or using matplotlib (see Figure 1), and the Graphviz library can be used to create unrooted layouts (see Figure 2).

=== Genome diagrams ===

The GenomeDiagram module provides methods of visualising sequences within Biopython. Sequences can be drawn in a linear or circular form (see Figure 3), and many output formats are supported, including PDF and PNG. Diagrams are created by making tracks and then adding sequence features to those tracks. By looping over a sequence&#x27;s features and using their attributes to decide if and how they are added to the diagram&#x27;s tracks, one can exercise much control over the appearance of the final diagram. Cross-links can be drawn between different tracks, allowing one to compare multiple sequences in a single diagram.

=== Macromolecular structure ===

The Bio.PDB module can load molecular structures from PDB and mmCIF files, and was added to Biopython in 2003. The codice_11 object is central to this module, and it organises macromolecular structure in a hierarchical fashion: codice_11 objects contain codice_13 objects which contain codice_14 objects which contain codice_15 objects which contain codice_16 objects. Disordered residues and atoms get their own classes, codice_17 and codice_18, that describe their uncertain positions.

Using Bio.PDB, one can navigate through individual components of a macromolecular structure file, such as examining each atom in a protein. Common analyses can be carried out, such as measuring distances or angles, comparing residues and calculating residue depth.

=== Population genetics ===

The Bio.PopGen module adds support to Biopython for Genepop, a software package for statistical analysis of population genetics. This allows for analyses of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, linkage disequilibrium and other features of a population&#x27;s allele frequencies.

This module can also carry out population genetic simulations using coalescent theory with the fastsimcoal2 program.

=== Wrappers for command line tools ===

Many of Biopython&#x27;s modules contain command line wrappers for commonly used tools, allowing these tools to be used from within Biopython. These wrappers include BLAST, Clustal, PhyML, EMBOSS and SAMtools. Users can subclass a generic wrapper class to add support for any other command line tool.

<text>Space adaptation syndrome (SAS) or space sickness is a condition experienced by as many as half of all space travelers during their adaptation to weightlessness once in orbit. It is the opposite of terrestrial motion sickness since it occurs when the environment and the person appear visually to be in motion relative to one another even though there is no corresponding sensation of bodily movement originating from the vestibular system.

==Presentation==
Space motion sickness can lead to degraded astronaut performance. SMS threatens operational requirements, reduces situational awareness, and threatens the safety of those exposed to micro-g environments. Lost muscle mass leads to difficulty with movement, especially when astronauts return to Earth. This can pose a safety issue if the need for emergency egress were to arise. Loss of muscle power makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for astronauts to climb through emergency egress hatches or create unconventional exit spaces in the case of a crash upon landing. Additionally, bone resorption and inadequate hydration in space can lead to the formation of kidney stones, and subsequent sudden incapacitation due to pain. If this were to occur during critical phases of flight, a capsule crash leading to worker injury and/or death could result. Short-term and long-term health effects have been seen in the cardiovascular system from exposure to the micro-g environment that would limit those exposed after they return to Earth or a regular gravity environment. Steps need to be taken to ensure proper precautions are taken into consideration when dealing a micro-g environment for worker safety. Orthostatic intolerance can lead to temporary loss of consciousness due to the lack of pressure and stroke volume. This loss of consciousness inhibits and endangers those affected and can lead to deadly consequences.

== Cause ==
When the vestibular system and the visual system report incongruous states of motion, the result is often nausea and other symptoms of disorientation known as motion sickness. According to contemporary sensory conflict theory, such conditions happen when the vestibular system and the visual system do not present a synchronized and unified representation of one&#x27;s body and surroundings. This theory is also known as neural mismatch, implying a mismatch occurring between ongoing sensory experience and long-term memory rather than between components of the vestibular and visual systems, emphasizing &quot;the limbic system in integration of sensory information and long-term memory, in the expression of the symptoms of motion sickness, and the impact of anti-motion-sickness drugs and stress hormones on limbic system function. The limbic system may be the neural mismatch center of the brain.&quot; At present a &quot;fully adequate theory of motion sickness is not presently available&quot; but at present the sensory conflict theory, referring to &quot;a discontinuity between either visual, proprioceptive, and somatosensory input, or semicircular canal and otolith input&quot;, may be the best available.
Space adaptation syndrome or space sickness is a kind of motion sickness that can occur when one&#x27;s surroundings visually appear to be in motion, but without a corresponding sense of bodily motion. This incongruous condition can occur during space travel when changes in g-forces compromise one&#x27;s spatial orientation. According to &quot;Science Daily&quot;, &quot;Gravity plays a major role in our spatial orientation. Changes in gravitational forces, such as the transition to weightlessness during a space voyage, influence our spatial orientation and require adaptation by many of the physiological processes in which our balance system plays a part. As long as this adaptation is incomplete, this can be coupled to nausea, visual illusions, and disorientation.&quot; Sleep deprivation can also increase susceptibility to space sickness, making symptoms worse and longer-lasting.

According to the sensory conflict hypothesis, space sickness is the opposite of the kinds of motion-related disorientation that occur in the presence of gravity, known as terrestrial motion sickness, such as becoming carsick, seasick, or airsick. In such cases, and in contrast to space sickness, one&#x27;s surroundings seem visually immobile (such as inside a car or airplane or a cabin below decks) while one&#x27;s body feels itself to be in motion. Contemporary motion sickness medications can counter various forms of motion disorientation including space sickness by temporarily suppressing the vestibular system, but are rarely used for space travel because it is considered better to allow space travelers to adapt naturally over the first one to seven days rather than to suffer the drowsiness and other side effects of medication taken over a longer period. However, transdermal dimenhydrinate anti-nausea patches are typically used whenever space suits are worn because vomiting into a space suit could be fatal by obscuring vision or blocking airflow. Space suits are generally worn during launch and landing by NASA crew members and always for extra-vehicular activities (EVAs). EVAs are consequently not usually scheduled for the first days of a mission to allow the crew to adapt, and transdermal dimenhydrinate patches are typically used as an additional backup measure.

==Management==
Just as space sickness has the opposite cause compared to terrestrial motion sickness, the two conditions have opposite non-medicinal remedies. The idea of sensory conflict implies that the most direct remedy for motion sickness in general is to resolve the conflict by re-synchronizing what one sees and what one feels. For most (but not all) kinds of terrestrial motion sickness, that can be achieved by viewing one&#x27;s surroundings from a window or (in the case of seasickness) going up on deck to observe the seas. For space sickness, relief is available via the opposite move of restricting one&#x27;s vision to a small area such as a book or a small screen, disregarding the overall surroundings until the adaptation process is complete, or simply to close one&#x27;s eyes until the nauseated feeling is reduced in intensity during the adjustment period. Some research indicates that blindness itself does not provide relief; &quot;Motion sickness can occur during exposure to physical motion, visual motion, and virtual motion, and only those without a functioning vestibular system are fully immune.

As with sea sickness and car sickness, space motion sickness symptoms can vary from mild nausea and disorientation to vomiting and intense discomfort; headaches and nausea are often reported in varying degrees. The most extreme reaction yet recorded was that felt by Senator Jake Garn in 1985 on Space Shuttle flight STS-51-D. NASA later jokingly began using the informal &quot;Garn scale&quot; to measure reactions to space sickness. In most cases, symptoms last from 2–4 days. When asked about the origins of &quot;Garn&quot;, Robert E. Stevenson said: 

Garn&#x27;s purpose on the mission was in part to subject him to experiments on space motion sickness. Predicting whether someone will experience space sickness is not possible. Someone who suffers from car sickness may not suffer from space sickness, and vice versa. In excellent physical condition, Garn did not become sick on the vomit comet before STS-51-D. All three astronauts on Skylab 3 suffered from nausea, although the three on Skylab 2 had not; the illness affected their work during the first few days, worrying NASA doctors.

Experienced aviators and space travelers can suffer from space sickness. Garn began piloting at the age of 16 and piloted a variety of military aircraft for 17,000 hours—more than any NASA astronaut—before STS-51-D. Charles D. Walker became ill on the same flight despite having flown on the shuttle before. While the Skylab 3 crew quickly recovered—whether by eating six smaller meals instead of three larger ones, or just by becoming used to space—one of the Skylab 4 crew became sick despite anti-nausea medication. Steven Smith estimated that on four shuttle flights he threw up 100 times.

Space sickness that occurs during space flight can also continue for days after landing, until the vestibular system has again adapted to gravity.

== History ==

In August 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Gherman Titov became the first human to experience space sickness on Vostok 2; he was the first person to vomit in space.

Apart from that record, space motion sickness was effectively unknown during the earliest spaceflights (Mercury, Gemini series) probably because these missions were undertaken in spacecraft providing very cramped conditions and permitting very little room for head movements; space sickness seems to be aggravated by being able to freely move around, especially in regard to head movement, and so is more common in larger spacecraft.

<text>Balmain is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Balmain is located west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Inner West Council.

It is located on the Balmain peninsula surrounded by Port Jackson, adjacent to the suburbs of Rozelle to the south-west, Birchgrove to the north-west, and Balmain East to the east. Iron Cove sits on the western side of the peninsula, with White Bay on the south-east side and Mort Bay on the north-east side.

Traditionally blue collar, Balmain was where the industrial roots of the trade unionist movement began. It has become established in Australian working-class culture and history, due to being the place where the Australian Labor Party formed in 1891 and its social history and status is of high cultural significance to both Sydney and New South Wales. Today, the ALP contends with the Australian Greens for political prominence in Balmain, and Kobi Shetty of the Greens holds the State seat of Balmain.

In the 21st century however, Balmain is often considered to be an affluent area. According to the 2021 Australian Bureau of Statistics, Balmain had a Median weekly household income of $3,039, and a 2021 article on the Domain website called Balmain comparable to Paddington

==History==
Prior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by indigenous Aboriginal Australian, Gadigal and Wangal people. Stories from early settlers in the area tell of how the local indigenous people used to hunt kangaroo by driving them through the bushy peninsula, down the hill to Peacock Point at the east end, where they were killed.

The area now known as Balmain was part of a grant to colonial surgeon William Balmain (1762–1803) made in 1800 by Governor John Hunter. A year later, Balmain transferred his entire holding to settle a debt to John Borthwick Gilchrist before returning to Scotland. The legality of the land transfer from Balmain to Gilchrist for only 5 shillings was challenged by Balmain&#x27;s descendants and further development of the area was blocked. The area subsequently became known as Gilchrist&#x27;s place, though court documents refer to the area as the Balmain Estate.

During the many years of legal challenges, the land was leased for farming and cattle purposes. In 1814 the adjacent homestead of Birchgrove was sold to Roland Warpole Loane, a merchant and settler descended from a family of English landlords. One hundred acres on the adjoining Balmain estate were leased to Loane.

In 1833, Gilchrist transferred power of attorney to Frederick Parbury. When Loane&#x27;s lease finally expired in 1836 and the land retrieved from his possession, Parbury commissioned surveyor John Armstrong to sub-divide the land into six parcels. Three parcels were sold to Thomas Hyndes in 1837. The area was rapidly sub-divided and developed during the 1840s and by 1861 had been divided into the well populated eastern suburb of Balmain and the sparsely populated western area, extending to the gates of Callan Park, known as Balmain West. 
===Industry===
The peninsula changed rapidly during the 1800s and became one of the premier industrial centres of Sydney. Industries clustered around Mort Bay included shipbuilding, a metal foundry, engineering, boilermaking and the Mort&#x27;s Dock &amp; Engineering Company works which opened in 1855—in 1958 Mort&#x27;s Dock closed and is the site of Mort Bay Park. Increasing industrialisation at Balmain created a demand for cheap housing. This was satisfied by the dock owners selling small blocks of land to entrepreneurs who then built tiny cottages and rented them to the workers. The Balmain Reservoir was built in 1915.

Lever Brothers Factory, owned by the British parent company, opened in 1895.

===Colliery===
A coal mine was opened in 1897 beside what is now Birchgrove Public School by an English company. The winding engine was said to be the largest in the southern hemisphere. However, with the endless labour disputes, Sydney Collieries Limited took over ownership. A further new shaft was sunk in 1904. From the bottom of the shafts a decline led down to a seam of coal situated under the harbour between Ballast Point and Goat Island. Because of the availability of the coal, Balmain Power Station was erected in stages from 1909. However, there were major industrial disputes in the 1920s and calls were made by some shareholders in 1928 to close the mine. The following year the colliery still employed 299 miners. By 1930 the colliery owners had given up and it had been taken over by the Balmain Coal Contracting Company, established by the Miner&#x27;s Federation to keep the pit operational, to no avail as disputes continued. On 13 October 1930 the Miners&#x27; Lodge declared the mine &quot;blacked&quot; as well as the manager, whose dismissal they demanded. The colliery closed in 1931. In 1933 it was proposed to extract natural gas for commercial use from the now disused mine. In 1936 calls were made for the Sydney City Council to take over the mine to no avail.

One local waterman who benefited from the Balmain coalmine was Bob Miller, who resided at 102 Glassop Street. He purchased a small tug and barge and secured a contract to remove the mine tailings, which he on sold to local councils as fill for a handsome profit. This was the beginning of the RW Miller industrial conglomerate. By 1924 his family had moved to Louisa Road.

===Tramway===
The opening of the tramway in the 1920s further established Balmain and it gained a reputation as a rough working-class area of Sydney. A large influx of immigrants boosted Balmain&#x27;s population in the 1950s.

===Gentrification===
Gentrification of Balmain began in the 1960s as industry waned. Balmain&#x27;s desirability to the middle class was due in part to its waterfront location and proximity to Sydney&#x27;s CBD. The Balmain Association was formed in 1965.

Increasing property values and waterfront development continued to push the suburb&#x27;s remaining industry out. In 1996, the Lever Brothers site became a series of apartment complexes with a handful of original buildings preserved. The power station was demolished in 1998 to make way for apartments. However, many aspects of Balmain&#x27;s industrial past have been retained as heritage.

== Heritage listings ==

Balmain has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 1 Blake Street: Ewenton
* Booth Street: Balmain Hospital Main Building
* Glassop Street: Dawn Fraser Swimming Pool
* 12b Grafton Street: Hampton Villa
* 37 Nicholson Street: Waterview Wharf Workshops
* Thames, Mort, College, McKell, Cameron, Yeend Streets: Mort&#x27;s Dock
* 2 Wells Street: Louisaville

==Demographics==
At the , the population of Balmain was 10,454. At the , it had a population of 10,453.

In 2021, 64.8% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 9.1%, New Zealand 2.8%, United States 1.7%, Ireland 1.3% and China 1.2%. 83.4% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 1.5% and Italian at 1.2%. The most common responses for religion in Balmain were no religion 51.9%, Catholic 20.7%, Anglican 9.9%, not stated 5.3% and Eastern Orthodox 2.2%. 37.6% of dwellings were flats, units or apartments, 39.9% were semi-detached terraced houses or townhouses and 21.8% were separate houses.

==Commercial area==

Darling Street, Balmain&#x27;s main thoroughfare, features boutique shops, quality restaurants and cafes alongside old drinking establishments. Landmarks on this street include the Post Office and Court House, alongside Balmain Town Hall, the historic Westpac Bank, Balmain Fire Station and Balmain Working Men&#x27;s Institute. Other commercial developments are scattered throughout the suburb. The headquarters of the NSW Water Police moved to Cameron Cove in Balmain in late 2007.

==Transport==
Balmain has several ferry wharves including Thames Street Balmain serviced by the Cockatoo Island ferry services, Elliot Street, Balmain West and Darling Street, Balmain East serviced by the Cross Harbour ferry services. Services run to Circular Quay. Transdev Sydney Ferries&#x27; maintenance and repair base is at Balmain Shipyard.

Balmain&#x27;s road network feeds into three main roads—Darling Street, Beattie Street and Montague/Mullen Street. These streets have limited speeds, typically 40 km/h and are all single carriageway with parallel parking. Due to the geography of the peninsula, all of these roads feed into Victoria Road and the Western Distributor. Sections of Balmain were to be demolished to make for the North-West Expressway but this was prevented after green bans were placed by the NSW Builders Labourers Federation.

Trams once ran all the way down Darling Street to the wharf at Balmain East. Due to the very steep incline at the bottom of the street, the trams used a complex &#x27;dummy&#x27; counterweight system constructed under the road surface. The trams were pushed up the steep hill by the dummy, and rode the dummy on the way down to safely descend the hill. Transit Systems bus services that service Balmain are:
*433 Balmain to Railway Square.
*441 Birchgrove to Art Gallery of New South Wales,
*442 Balmain to the Queen Victoria Building
*445 Balmain to Campsie
==Culture==
The Balmain bug (&quot;Ibacus peronii&quot;), a type of slipper lobster commonly eaten in Sydney, is named after Balmain.

===Historic hotels===
Balmain is home to many historic hotels, including the Cat and Fiddle Hotel, Cricketer&#x27;s Arms Hotel, Dick&#x27;s Hotel, Dry Dock Hotel, Exchange Hotel, Forth &amp; Clyde Hotel, Kent Hotel, Unity Hall Hotel, London Hotel, Mort Bay Hotel, Norfolk Pines Hotel, Pacific Hotel, Royal Oak Hotel, Shipwright&#x27;s Arms Hotel, Star Hotel, Town Hall Hotel, Volunteer Hotel and the West End Hotel.

The Riverview Hotel is a heritage-listed corner building built in 1880 in the Arts and Crafts style. Between 1888 and 1913 the pub was named Bergin&#x27;s Hotel after the publican Joseph Bergin. Australian swimming champion Dawn Fraser was publican of the Riverview from 1978 to 1983.

===Pop culture===

Numerous phrases have been used to describe the suburb and its inhabitants, including &quot;Balmain boys don&#x27;t cry&quot; (former NSW Premier Neville Wran at the Street Royal Commission); &quot;You can take the boy out of Balmain, but you can&#x27;t take Balmain out of the boy&quot; (Unknown); &quot;There are only two types of men in this world: those who were born in Balmain and those who wish they were&quot; (a Police Commissioner of New South Wales). Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating commented on the suburb&#x27;s gentrification by using the term &quot;Basket weavers of Balmain&quot;.
Until the 1970s, older Balmain people would refer to &quot;going to Sydney&quot;. The Post Office/ Court/ Police building and vicinity was generally referred to as the &quot;Town Hall&quot;, with the Post Office clock often called the Town Hall clock. This was probably due to the Post Office &amp; Court Building being built in between the earlier Town Hall &amp; Town Hall Hotel.

In the mid-1960s Balmain was the setting for the popular Seven Network situation comedy series &quot;My Name&#x27;s McGooley, What&#x27;s Yours?&quot;, starring Gordon Chater, John Meillon and Judi Farr.

Balmain was the setting for the 1994 Australian film &quot;The Sum of Us&quot;, which starred Jack Thompson, John Polson and Russell Crowe.

The former Pacific Hotel (from 2019, now converted into a residential property) - as well as several other locations in Balmain - were used extensively as the set of the Australian television soap opera, &quot;E Street&quot;.

===Parks and reserves===

Balmain has a number of parks including Gladstone Park, Birrung Park and White Bay Park. The wider peninsula has many more parks in close proximity, particularly along the foreshores.
In earlier times Punch Park was the goto place for park footy (rugby league), though it was always referred to by the boys then as Punch&#x27;s Park

===Sport and recreation===
Balmain is home to the Balmain Tigers district rugby league football club that is now represented in the NRL by Wests Tigers rugby league club. The club was formed in mid-1999 by a joint venture between the Balmain Tigers and the Western Suburbs Magpies in preparation for the 2000 season. In 2005 the Tigers defeated the North Queensland Cowboys in the Grand Final to win the premiership.

The Balmain Rugby Football Club, founded in 1873, took part in the very first competition structure and in fact winning their first premiership in 1875. Players lost fighting in World War I forced the club to merge with the Glebe &quot;Dirty Reds&quot; RUFC in 1919, to form the Glebe-Balmain RFC. As a merged club they had enormous success during the Twenties, winning four premierships. In 1931, as a depression project, Drummoyne Oval, as it is now known, was constructed on the site of a small oval which Glebe and Balmain had used for junior matches since 1892. To ensure longevity of tenure, and because there were just not enough sporting grounds in Sydney—with some reluctance—the Glebe-Balmain Club decided to change its name to the Drummoyne District Rugby Football Club. It did so without giving up its long-held traditions, the scarlet jumpers of Glebe and its world-famous tag, &quot;The Dirty Reds&quot; and the black and gold of Balmain, colours still worn proudly by today&#x27;s players in their socks. Drummoyne Rugby Club is still in existence and still upholds it proud history and traditions.

The suburb is also home to the Balmain Australian Football Club, a founding member in 1903 of the Sydney Football League.

Balmain is also home to Balmain FC, who are a semi-professional football club, playing in the National Premier Leagues NSW 3. In 2015 they qualified for the Australia-wide FFA Cup Round of 32 and were drawn against A-League club Melbourne Victory FC in which they were defeated 6–0 in front of 5,000 fans at Leichhardt Oval.

Balmain Sailing Club is located in nearby Birchgrove and is home to the annual Balmain Regatta.

Balmain Rowing Club was formed in July 1882, and still occupies its original White Street location. The club adopted black and yellow colours from its formation, which soon became the district colours. The great Illawarra sculling champion Bill Beach had a close association with the club and wore their black and gold colours in competition.

==Housing==
The post-industrial gentrification of Balmain has resulted in a suburb of considerable charm and interest where the modest, pretty houses command high prices. However, Balmain still retains a diverse mix of residents due to the Housing Commission unit blocks in the suburb. Much of the suburb is a heritage conservation area and creative design is required to modernise the Victorian and Edwardian housing stock. In 2013 a contemporary Balmain house designed by architect Harry Seidler sold for $6m. The Tom Uren House in Gilchrist Place was designed by Richard Leplastrier.

<text>The Open Bioinformatics Foundation is a non-profit, volunteer-run organization focused on supporting open source programming in bioinformatics. The mission of the foundation is to support the development of open source toolkits for bioinformatics, organise developer-centric hackathon events and generally assist in the development and promotion of open source software development in the life sciences. The foundation also organises and runs the annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference, a satellite meeting of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference. The foundation participates in the Google Summer of Code, acting as an umbrella organisation for individual bioinformatics-related projects.

The Open Bioinformatics Foundation was started in 2001, arising from the BioJava, BioPerl and BioPython projects. A formal membership for the foundation was created in 2005. In October 2012, the foundation began an association with Software in the Public Interest (SPI), a US-based non-profit which aids other organizations in the creation and distribution of free and open-source software. The association with SPI allows financial donations to the foundation (these are 501(c)3 tax-exempt in the US).

The foundation is governed by a board of directors, representing various Bio* projects. As of 2019, the OBF President is Peter Cock (BioPython). Previous OBF presidents include Ewan Birney and Hilmar Lapp (NESCent), previous Board members include Steven E. Brenner.

==Projects==
The foundation hosts servers for mailing lists, websites, and code repositories for a number of bioinformatics-related open source projects, including:
* BioJava – Java toolkit

<doc id="559874" wikidata="Q729735" url="?curid=559874" title="Chronic myelogenous leukemia">
<text>Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.
CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001. These drugs have revolutionized treatment of this disease and allow most patients to have a good quality of life when compared to the former chemotherapy drugs. In Western countries, CML accounts for 15–25% of all adult leukemias and 14% of leukemias overall (including the pediatric population, where CML is less common).

==Signs and symptoms==
The way CML presents depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis as it has been known to skip stages in some cases.

Most patients (~90%) are diagnosed during the chronic stage which is most often asymptomatic. In these cases, it may be diagnosed incidentally with an elevated white blood cell count on a routine laboratory test. It can also present with symptoms indicative of hepatosplenomegaly and the resulting left upper quadrant pain this causes. The enlarged spleen may put pressure on the stomach causing a loss of appetite and resulting weight loss. It may also present with mild fever and night sweats due to an elevated basal level of metabolism.

Some (&lt;10%) are diagnosed during the accelerated stage which most often presents bleeding, petechiae and ecchymosis. In these patients fevers are most commonly the result of opportunistic infections.

Some patients are initially diagnosed in the blast phase in which the symptoms are most likely fever, bone pain and an increase in bone marrow fibrosis.

==Cause==
In most cases, no obvious cause for CML can be isolated.

===Risk factors===

CML is more common in males than in females (male to female ratio of 1.4:1) and appears more commonly in the elderly with a median age at diagnosis of 65 years. Exposure to ionising radiation appears to be a risk factor, based on a 50 fold higher incidence of CML in Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuclear bombing survivors. The rate of CML in these individuals seems to peak about 10 years after the exposure.

==Pathophysiology==
CML was the first cancer to be linked to a clear genetic abnormality, the chromosomal translocation known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This chromosomal abnormality is so named because it was first discovered and described in 1960 by two scientists from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US: Peter Nowell of the University of Pennsylvania and David Hungerford of Fox Chase Cancer Center.

In this translocation, parts of two chromosomes (the 9th and 22nd) switch places. As a result, part of the BCR (&quot;breakpoint cluster region&quot;) gene from chromosome 22 is fused with the ABL gene on chromosome 9. This abnormal &quot;fusion&quot; gene generates a protein of p210 or sometimes p185 weight (p210 is short for 210 kDa protein, a shorthand used for characterizing proteins based solely on size). Because abl carries a domain that can add phosphate groups to tyrosine residues (a tyrosine kinase), the &quot;bcr-abl&quot; fusion gene product is also a tyrosine kinase.
The fused BCR-ABL protein interacts with the interleukin 3beta(c) receptor subunit. The BCR-ABL transcript is continuously active and does not require activation by other cellular messaging proteins. In turn, BCR-ABL activates a cascade of proteins that control the cell cycle, speeding up cell division. Moreover, the BCR-ABL protein inhibits DNA repair, causing genomic instability and making the cell more susceptible to developing further genetic abnormalities. The action of the BCR-ABL protein is the pathophysiologic cause of chronic myelogenous leukemia. With improved understanding of the nature of the BCR-ABL protein and its action as a tyrosine kinase, targeted therapies (the first of which was imatinib) that specifically inhibit the activity of the BCR-ABL protein have been developed. These tyrosine kinase inhibitors can induce complete remissions in CML, confirming the central importance of bcr-abl as the cause of CML.

==Diagnosis==

CML is often suspected on the basis of a complete blood count, which shows increased granulocytes of all types, typically including mature myeloid cells. Basophils and eosinophils are almost universally increased; this feature may help differentiate CML from a leukemoid reaction. A bone marrow biopsy is often performed as part of the evaluation for CML, and CML is diagnosed by cytogenetics that detects the translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) which involves the ABL1 gene in chromosome 9 and the BCR gene in chromosome 22. As a result of this translocation, the chromosome looks smaller than its homologue chromosome, and this appearance is known as the Philadelphia chromosome chromosomal abnormality. Thus, this abnormality can be detected by routine cytogenetics, and the involved genes BCR-ABL1 can be detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization, as well as by PCR.

Controversy exists over so-called &quot;Ph-negative&quot; CML, or cases of suspected CML in which the Philadelphia chromosome cannot be detected. Many such patients in fact have complex chromosomal abnormalities that mask the (9;22) translocation, or have evidence of the translocation by FISH or RT-PCR in spite of normal routine karyotyping. The small subset of patients without detectable molecular evidence of BCR-ABL1 fusion may be better classified as having an undifferentiated myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disorder, as their clinical course tends to be different from patients with CML.

CML must be distinguished from a leukemoid reaction, which can have a similar appearance on a blood smear.

CML is often divided into three phases based on clinical characteristics and laboratory findings. In the absence of intervention, CML typically begins in the &quot;chronic&quot; phase, and over the course of several years progresses to an &quot;accelerated&quot; phase and ultimately to a &quot;blast crisis&quot;. Blast crisis is the terminal phase of CML and clinically behaves like an acute leukemia. Drug treatment will usually stop this progression if early. One of the drivers of the progression from chronic phase through acceleration and blast crisis is the acquisition of new chromosomal abnormalities (in addition to the Philadelphia chromosome). Some patients may already be in the accelerated phase or blast crisis by the time they are diagnosed.

====Chronic phase====
Approximately 85% of patients with CML are in the chronic phase at the time of diagnosis. During this phase, patients are usually asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms of fatigue, left side pain, joint and/or hip pain, or abdominal fullness. The duration of chronic phase is variable and depends on how early the disease was diagnosed as well as the therapies used. In the absence of treatment, the disease progresses to an accelerated phase. Precise patient staging based on clinical markers and personal genomic profile will likely prove beneficial in the assessment of disease history with respect to progression risk.

====Accelerated phase====
Criteria for diagnosing transition into the accelerated phase are somewhat variable; the most widely used criteria are those put forward by investigators at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, by Sokal et al., and the World Health Organization. The WHO criteria are perhaps most widely used, and define the accelerated phase by the presence of ≥1 of the following haematological/cytogenetic criteria or provisional criteria concerning response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy
* Haematological/cytogenetic criteria
** Persistent or increasing high white blood cell count (&gt; 10 × 109/L), unresponsive to therapy
** Persistent or increasing splenomegaly, unresponsive to therapy
** Persistent thrombocytosis (&gt; 1000 × 109/L), unresponsive to therapy
** Persistent thrombocytopenia (&lt; 100 × 109/L), unrelated to therapy
** ≥ 20% basophils in the peripheral blood
** 10–19% blasts in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow
** Additional clonal chromosomal abnormalities in Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive (Ph+) cells at diagnosis, including so-called major route abnormalities (a second Ph chromosome, trisomy 8, isochromosome 17q, trisomy 19), complex karyotype, and abnormalities of 3q26.2
** Any new clonal chromosomal abnormality in Ph+ cells that occurs during therapy
* Provisional response-to-TKI criteria
** Haematological resistance (or failure to achieve a complete haematological response d) to the first TKI
** Any haematological, cytogenetic, or molecular indications of resistance to two sequential TKIs
** Occurrence of two or more mutations in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene during TKI therapy

The patient is considered to be in the accelerated phase if any of the above are present. The accelerated phase is significant because it signals that the disease is progressing and transformation to blast crisis is imminent. Drug treatment often becomes less effective in the advanced stages.

====Blast crisis====
Blast crisis is the final phase in the evolution of CML, and behaves like an acute leukemia, with rapid progression and short survival. Blast crisis is diagnosed if any of the following are present in a patient with CML:
* &gt;20% blasts in the blood or bone marrow
* The presence of an extramedullary proliferation of blasts

==Treatment==
The only curative treatment for CML is a bone marrow transplant or an allogeneic stem cell transplant. Other than this there are four major mainstays of treatment in CML: treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, myelosuppressive or leukapheresis therapy (to counteract the leukocytosis during early treatment), splenectomy and interferon alfa-2b treatment. Due to the high median age of patients with CML it is relatively rare for CML to be seen in pregnant women, despite this, however, chronic myelogenous leukemia can be treated with relative safety at any time during pregnancy with the cytokine interferon-alpha.

===Chronic phase===
In the past, antimetabolites (e.g., cytarabine, hydroxyurea), alkylating agents, interferon alfa 2b, and steroids were used as treatments of CML in the chronic phase, but since the 2000s have been replaced by Bcr-Abl tyrosine-kinase inhibitors drugs that specifically target BCR-ABL, the constitutively activated tyrosine kinase fusion protein caused by the Philadelphia chromosome translocation. Despite the move to replacing cytotoxic antineoplastics (standard anticancer drugs) with tyrosine kinase inhibitors sometimes hydroxyurea is still used to counteract the high leukocyte counts encountered during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib; in these situations it may be the preferred myelosuppressive agent due to its relative lack of leukemogenic effects and hence the relative lack of potential for secondary haematologic malignancies to result from treatment. IRIS, an international study that compared interferon/cytarabine combination and the first of these new drugs imatinib, with long-term follow up, demonstrated the clear superiority of tyrosine-kinase-targeted inhibition over existing treatments.

====Imatinib====
The first of this new class of drugs was imatinib mesylate (marketed as Gleevec or Glivec), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2001. Imatinib was found to inhibit the progression of CML in the majority of patients (65–75%) sufficiently to achieve regrowth of their normal bone marrow stem cell population (a cytogenetic response) with stable proportions of maturing white blood cells. Because some leukemic cells (as evaluated by RT-PCR) persist in nearly all patients, the treatment has to be continued indefinitely. Since the advent of imatinib, CML has become the first cancer in which a standard medical treatment may give to the patient a normal life expectancy.

==== Dasatinib, nilotinib, radotinib, bosutinib, and asciminib ====
To overcome imatinib resistance and to increase responsiveness to TK inhibitors, four novel agents were later developed. The first, dasatinib, blocks several further oncogenic proteins, in addition to more potent inhibition of the BCR-ABL protein, and was approved in 2007, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat CML in people who were either resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. A second TK inhibitor, nilotinib, was approved by the FDA for the same indication. In 2010, nilotinib and dasatinib were also approved for first-line therapy, making three drugs in this class available for treatment of newly diagnosed CML. In 2012, radotinib joined the class of novel agents in the inhibition of the BCR-ABL protein and was approved in South Korea for people resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. Bosutinib received US FDA and EU European Medicines Agency approval on 4 September 2012, and 27 March 2013, respectively for the treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with resistance, or intolerance to prior therapy.

Asciminib (Scemblix) was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2021.

====Treatment-resistant CML====
While capable of producing significantly improved responses compared with the action of imatinib, neither dasatinib nor nilotinib could overcome drug resistance caused by one particular mutation found to occur in the structure of BCR-ABL1 known as the T315I mutation (in other words, where the 315th amino acid is mutated from a threonine residue to an isoleucine residue). Two approaches were developed to the treatment of CML as a result:

In 2007, Chemgenex released results of an open-label Phase 2/3 study (CGX-635-CML-202) that investigated the use of a non BCR-ABL targeted agent omacetaxine, administered subcutaneously (under the skin) in patients who had failed with imatinib and exhibited T315I kinase domain mutation. This is a study which is ongoing through 2014. In September 2012, the FDA approved omacetaxine for the treatment of CML in the case of resistance to other chemotherapeutic agents.

Independently, ARIAD pharmaceuticals, adapting the chemical structures from first and second-generation TK inhibitors, arrived at a new pan-BCR-ABL1 inhibitor which showed (for the first time) efficacy against T315I, as well as all other known mutations of the oncoprotein. The drug, ponatinib, gained FDA approval in December 2012 for treatment of patients with resistant or intolerant CML. Just as with second-generation TK inhibitors, early approval is being sought to extend the use of ponatinib to newly diagnosed CML also.

In October 2021, the Food and Drug Administration approved asciminib (Scemblix), the first TK inhibitor specifically targeting the ABL1 myristoyl pocket (STAMP) via allosteric binding, as a third-line option for patients with chronic-phase-CML.

=== Vaccination ===
In 2005, encouraging but mixed results of vaccination were reported with the &quot;BCR/ABL1&quot; p210 fusion protein in patients with stable disease, with GM-CSF as an adjuvant.

==Prognosis==
Before the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the median survival time for CML patients had been about 3–5 years from time of diagnosis.

With the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, survival rates have improved dramatically. A 2006 follow-up of 553 patients using imatinib (Gleevec) found an overall survival rate of 89% after five years.

A 2011 followup of 832 patients using imatinib who achieved a stable cytogenetic response found an overall survival rate of 95.2% after 8 years, which is similar to the rate in the general population. Fewer than 1% of patients died because of leukemia progression.

==Epidemiology==

===United Kingdom===
CML accounts for 8% of all leukaemias in the UK, and around 680 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011.

===United States===
The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2014, about 5,980 new cases of chronic myeloid leukemia were diagnosed, and about 810 people died of the disease. This means that a little over 10% of all newly diagnosed leukemia cases will be chronic myeloid leukemia. The average risk of a person getting this disease is 1 in 588. The disease is more common in men than women, and more common in whites than African-Americans. The average age at diagnosis is 64 years, and this disease is rarely seen in children.

<text>Margaret Mary Day Lockwood, CBE (15 September 1916 – 15 July 1990), was a British actress. One of Britain&#x27;s most popular film stars of the 1930s and 1940s, her film appearances included &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938), &quot;Night Train to Munich&quot; (1940), &quot;The Man in Grey&quot; (1943), and &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1945). She was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress for the 1955 film &quot;Cast a Dark Shadow&quot;. She also starred in the television series &quot;Justice&quot; (1971–74).

==Early life==
Lockwood was born on 15 September 1916 in Karachi, British India (today Pakistan), to Henry Francis Lockwood, an English administrator of a railway company, and his third wife, Scottish-born Margaret Eveline Waugh. She moved to England in 1920 with her mother, brother Lyn and half-brother Frank. Her half-sister Fay joined them the following year, but her father remained in Karachi, visiting them infrequently. She also had another half-brother, John, from her father&#x27;s first marriage, brought up by his mother in Britain. Lockwood attended Sydenham High School for girls and a ladies&#x27; school in Kensington, London.

She began studying for the stage at an early age at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, and made her debut in 1928, at the age of 12, at the Holborn Empire where she played a fairy in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. In December of the following year, she appeared at the Scala Theatre in the pantomime &quot;The Babes in the Wood&quot;. In 1932 she appeared at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in &quot;Cavalcade&quot;.

==Career==
In 1933, Lockwood enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, where she was seen by a talent scout and signed to a contract. In June 1934 she played Myrtle in &quot;House on Fire&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, and on 22 August 1934 appeared as Margaret Hamilton in Gertrude Jenning&#x27;s play &quot;Family Affairs&quot; when it premiered at the Ambassadors Theatre; Helene Ferber in &quot;Repayment&quot; at the Arts Theatre in January 1936; Trixie Drew in Henry Bernard&#x27;s play &quot;Miss Smith&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in July 1936; and back at the Queen&#x27;s in July 1937 as Ann Harlow in &quot;Ann&#x27;s Lapse&quot;.

===Films===
Lockwood entered films in 1934, and in 1935 she appeared in the film version of &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;. For this, British Lion put her under contract for £500 a year for the first year, going up to £750 a year for the second year.

For British Lion she was in &quot;The Case of Gabriel Perry&quot; (1935), then was in &quot;Honours Easy&quot; (1935) with Greta Nissen and &quot;Man of the Moment&quot; (1935) with Douglas Fairbanks Jnr. These were standard ingénue roles. She was the female love interest in &quot;Midshipman Easy&quot; (1935), directed by Carol Reed, who would become crucial to Lockwood&#x27;s career. She had the lead in &quot;Someday&quot; (1935), a quota quickie directed by Michael Powell and in &quot;Jury&#x27;s Evidence&quot; (1936), directed by Ralph Ince.

Lockwood had a small role in &quot;The Amateur Gentleman&quot; (1936), another with Fairbanks. Her profile rose when she appeared opposite Maurice Chevalier in &quot;The Beloved Vagabond&quot; (1936)

She followed it with &quot;Irish for Luck&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Street Singer&quot; (1937). She had a small role in &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Lady Friend?&quot; (1937), again for Carol Reed and was in &quot;Melody and Romance&quot; (1937).

===Gaumont British===
Gaumont British were making a film version of the novel &quot;Doctor Syn&quot;, starring George Arliss and Anna Lee with director Roy William Neill and producer Edward Black. Lee dropped out and was replaced by Lockwood. Lockwood so impressed the studio with her performance – particularly Black, who became a champion of hers – she signed a three-year contract with Gainsborough Pictures in June 1937. This was at £4,000 a year. According to writer Alan Wood, &quot;Many people were astonished at the contract Ted Black gave her; but when they asked him about it, he said, &quot;She has something with which every girl in the suburbs can identify herself&quot;. Black backed his judgment and built Margaret Lockwood into a star.&quot;

For Black and director Robert Stevenson she supported Will Fyffe in &quot;Owd Bob&quot; (1938), with John Loder.

===British Stardom: &quot;Bank Holiday&quot; and &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;===

Lockwood then had her best chance to-date, being given the lead in &quot;Bank Holiday&quot;, directed by Carol Reed and produced by Black. This movie was a hit and launched Lockwood as a star. She called it &quot;my first really big picture... with a beautifully written script and a wonderful part for me.&quot; Gaumont increased her contract from three years to six.

Even more popular was her next movie, &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, produced by Black and co-starring Michael Redgrave. Lockwood called it &quot;one of the films I have enjoyed most in all my career.&quot; Hitchcock was greatly impressed by Lockwood, telling the press:
She has an undoubted gift in expressing her beauty in terms of emotion, which is exceptionally well suited to the camera. Allied to this is the fact that she photographs more than normally easily, and has an extraordinary insight in getting the feel of her lines, to live within them, so to speak, as long as the duration of the picture lasts. It is not too much to expect that, in Margaret Lockwood, the British picture industry has a possibility of developing a star of hitherto un-anticipated possibilities.
She followed this with &quot;A Girl Must Live&quot;, a musical comedy about chorus girls for Black and Reed. It was one of a series of films made by Gaumont aimed at the US market.

===American films===
Gaumont British had distribution agreements with 20th Century Fox in the US and they expressed an interest in borrowing Lockwood for some films. She travelled to Los Angeles and was put to work supporting Shirley Temple in &quot;Susannah of the Mounties&quot; (1939). She was borrowed by Paramount for &quot;Rulers of the Sea&quot; (1939), with Will Fyffe and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Paramount indicated a desire to use Lockwood in more films but she decided to go home.

===Return to Britain===
Lockwood returned to Britain in June 1939. She was meant to make film versions of &quot;Rob Roy&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot; but both projects were cancelled with the advent of war. Instead, she played the role of Jenny Sunley, the self-centred, frivolous wife of Michael Redgrave&#x27;s character in &quot;The Stars Look Down&quot; for Carol Reed. Lockwood later admitted &quot;I was far from being reconciled to my role of the unpleasant girl and everyone treated me warily. But as the film progressed I found myself working with Carol Reed and Michael Redgrave again and gradually I was fascinated to see what I could put into the part.&quot;

She did another with Reed, &quot;Night Train to Munich&quot; (1940), an attempt to repeat the success of &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; with the same screenwriters (Launder and Gilliat) and characters of Charters and Caldicott. Rex Harrison was the male star. This movie started filming in November 1939.

She was meant to be reunited with Reed and Redgrave in &quot;The Girl in the News&quot; (1940) but Redgrave withdrew, and he was replaced by Barry K. Barnes: Black produced and Sidney Gilliat wrote the script. &quot;Quiet Wedding&quot; (1941) was a comedy directed by Anthony Asquith. She was meant to appear in &quot;Hatter&#x27;s Castle&quot;, but she withdrew because of pregnancy. Her return to acting was &quot;Alibi&quot; (1942), a thriller which she called &quot;anything but a success...a bad film.&quot;

In September 1943 &quot;Variety&quot; estimated her salary at being US$24,000 per picture ().

==Career peak==
===&quot;The Man in Grey&quot;===
Lockwood was well established as a middle-tier name. What made her a front rank star was &quot;The Man in Grey&quot; (1943), the first of what would be known as the Gainsborough melodramas. Lockwood wanted to play the part of Clarissa, but producer Edward Black cast her as the villainous Hesther. She was featured alongside Phyllis Calvert, James Mason and Stewart Granger for director Leslie Arliss. The film was a massive hit, one of the biggest in 1943 Britain, and made all four lead actors into top stars – at the end of the year, exhibitors voted Lockwood the seventh most popular British star at the box office.

She appeared in two comedies for Black: &quot;Dear Octopus&quot; (1943) with Michael Wilding from a play by Dodie Smith, which Lockwood felt was a backward step and &quot;Give Us the Moon&quot; (1944), with Vic Oliver directed by Val Guest. Much more popular than either of these was another melodrama with Arliss and Granger, &quot;Love Story&quot; (1944), where she played a terminally ill pianist.

Lockwood was reunited with James Mason in &quot;A Place of One&#x27;s Own&quot; (1945), playing a housekeeper possessed by the spirit of a dead girl, but the film was not a success. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Sweetheart&quot; (1945) was a musical with Guest and Vic Oliver.

===&quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;===
Lockwood had the biggest success of her career to-date with the title role in &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; (1945) for director Arliss. The film was the most popular movie at the British box office in 1946. In 1946, Lockwood gained the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; National Film Awards First Prize for most popular British film actress.

She was offered the role of Bianca in &quot;The Magic Bow&quot; but disliked the part and turned it down. Instead she was a murderess in &quot;Bedelia&quot; (1946), which did not perform as well, although it was popular in Britain.

===Contract with Rank===
In July 1946, Lockwood signed a six-year contract with Rank to make two movies a year. The first of these was &quot;Hungry Hill&quot; (1947), an expensive adaptation of the novel by Daphne du Maurier which was not the expected success at the box office. More popular was &quot;Jassy&quot; (1947), the seventh biggest hit at the British box office in 1947. It was the last of &quot;official&quot; Gainsborough melodramas – the studio had come under the control of J. Arthur Rank who disliked the genre. &quot;Filmink&quot; argued Lockwood&#x27;s career never recovered from the death of Ted Black in 1948.

She was a warden in &quot;The White Unicorn&quot; (1947), a melodrama from the team of Harold Huth and John Corfield. Rank wanted to star her in a film about Mary Magdalene but Lockwood was unhappy with the script. She refused to appear in &quot;Roses for Her Pillow&quot; (which became &quot;Once Upon a Dream&quot;) and was put on suspension. &quot;I was sick of getting mediocre parts and poor scripts&quot;, she later wrote. &quot;Since 1945 I had been sick of it... there had been little or no improvement to me in the films I was being offered.&quot; She later said &quot;I was having fun being a rebel.&quot;

During her suspension she went on a publicity tour for Rank. She also appeared in an acclaimed TV production of &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (1948). then went off suspension when she made &quot;Look Before You Love&quot; (1948), a comedy for Corfield and Huth.

Lockwood had a change of pace with the comedy &quot;Cardboard Cavalier&quot; (1949), with Lockwood playing Nell Gwyn. The film was a critical and box-office disappointment. &quot;I was terribly distressed when I read the press notices of the film&quot;, wrote Lockwood.

That same year, Lockwood was announced to play Becky Sharp in a film adaptation of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; but it was not made.

Lockwood was in the melodrama &quot;Madness of the Heart&quot; (1949), but the film was not a particular success. When a proposed film about Elisabeth of Austria was cancelled, she returned to the stage in a record-breaking national tour of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot; (1949) and then played the title role in productions of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan&quot; in 1949 and 1950. She also performed in a pantomime of &quot;Cinderella&quot; for the Royal Film performance with Jean Simmons; Lockwood called this &quot;the jolliest show in which I have ever taken part.&quot;

She returned to film-making after an 18-month absence to star in &quot;Highly Dangerous&quot; (1950), a comic thriller in the vein of &quot;Lady Vanishes&quot;, written expressly for her by Eric Ambler and directed by Roy Ward Baker. It was not popular. Rank was to put her in an adaptation of &quot;Ann Veronica&quot; by H. G. Wells but the film was postponed. She turned down the female lead in &quot;The Browning Version&quot;, and a proposed sequel to &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;, &quot;The Wicked Lady&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, was never made.

Eventually her contract with Rank ended and she played Eliza Doolittle in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; at the Edinburgh Festival of 1951.

===Herbert Wilcox===
In 1952, Lockwood signed a two picture a year contract with Herbert Wilcox at $112,000 a year, making her the best paid actress in British films. Lockwood said Wilcox and his wife Anna Neagle promised from signing the contract &quot;I was never allowed to forget that I was a really bright and dazzling star on their horizon. They were going to look after me as no one else had done before. They did. And I loved it.&quot;

The association began well with &quot;Trent&#x27;s Last Case&quot; (1952) with Michael Wilding and Orson Welles, which was popular. She appeared on TV in &quot;Ann Veronica&quot; and another TV adaptation of the Shaw play &quot;Captain Brassbound&#x27;s Conversion&quot; (1953).

Her next two films for Wilcox were commercial disappointments: &quot;Laughing Anne&quot; (1953) and &quot;Trouble in the Glen&quot; (1954). She made no more films with Wilcox who called her &quot;a director&#x27;s joy who can shade a performance or a character with computer accuracy&quot;, but he admitted their collaboration &quot;did not come off.&quot;

Lockwood returned to the stage in &quot;Spider&#x27;s Web&quot; (1954) by Agatha Christie, expressly written for her.

She then appeared in &quot;Cast a Dark Shadow&quot; (1955) with Dirk Bogarde for director Lewis Gilbert. Gilbert later said &quot;It was reasonably successful, but, by then, Margaret had been in several really bad films and her name on a picture was rather counter-productive.&quot;

==Later career==
===Television===
As her popularity waned in the post war years, she returned to occasional performances on the West End stage and appeared on television; her television debut was in 1948 when she played Eliza Doolittle.

She was in a BBC adaptation of Christie&#x27;s &quot;Spider&#x27;s Web&quot; (1955), Janet Green&#x27;s &quot;Murder Mistaken&quot; (1956), Dodie Smith&#x27;s &quot;Call It a Day&quot; (1956) and Arnold Bennett&#x27;s &quot;The Great Adventure&quot; (1958).

She had the lead in a TV series &quot;The Royalty&quot; (1957–1958) and appeared regularly on TV anthology series. She played an aging West End star attempting a comeback in &quot;The Human Jungle&quot; with Herbert Lom (1965). She starred in another series &quot;The Flying Swan&quot; (1965).

===Later career===
Her subsequent long-running West End hits include an all-star production of Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1965–66, in which she played the villainous Mrs Cheveley), W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;Lady Frederick&quot; (1970), &quot;Relative Values&quot; (Noël Coward revival, 1973) and the thrillers &quot;Signpost to Murder&quot; (1962) and &quot;Double Edge&quot; (1975).

In 1969 she starred as barrister Julia Stanford in the TV play &quot;Justice is a Woman&quot;. This inspired the Yorkshire Television series &quot;Justice&quot;, which ran for three seasons (39 episodes) from 1971 to 1974, and featured her real-life partner John Stone as fictional boyfriend Dr Ian Moody. Lockwood&#x27;s role as the feisty Harriet Peterson won her Best Actress Awards from the &quot;TV Times&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Sun&quot; (1973). In 1975, film director Bryan Forbes persuaded her out of an apparent retirement from feature films to play the role of the Stepmother in her last feature film &quot;The Slipper and the Rose&quot;. This film also included the final appearance of Edith Evans and one of the later appearances of Kenneth More.

Her last professional appearance was as Queen Alexandra in Royce Ryton&#x27;s stage play &quot;Motherdear&quot; (Ambassadors Theatre, 1980).

Margaret Lockwood was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1981 New Year Honours.

She was the subject on an episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in December 1963. She was a guest on the radio show &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; on 25 April 1951.

==Personal life and death==
Lockwood married Rupert Leon whom she had met in her teens and secretly married in 1937 when she turned 21; they divorced in 1950. She lived her final years in seclusion in Kingston upon Thames, dying on 15 July 1990 at age 73 at the Cromwell Hospital from cirrhosis of the liver, though she was not a drinker. Her body was cremated at Putney Vale Crematorium. She was survived by her daughter, the actress Julia Lockwood (née Margaret Julia Leon, 1941–2019).

<text>Irina Eduardovna Slutskaya (; born 9 February 1979) is a Russian former figure skater. She is a two-time World champion (2002, 2005), two-time Olympic medalist (silver in 2002, bronze in 2006), seven-time European champion (1996, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006), a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (2000–2002, 2005) and a four-time Russian national champion (2000–2002, 2005). She won a record total of 17 titles on the Grand Prix circuit.

Slutskaya, known for her athletic ability, was the first female skater to land a triple lutz-triple loop combination. She is also known for her trademark double Biellmann spin with a foot change, which she also invented. With her women&#x27;s record seven European titles, she is generally considered to be one of the most successful ladies&#x27; singles skaters in Russian and European history.

==Career==
===Early years===
Slutskaya started skating at the age of four, encouraged by her mother. Coached by Zhanna Gromova from the age of six, she first made her mark as a promising junior skater by winning the bronze medal at the 1994 World Junior Championships, held in December 1993 in Colorado Springs. This would be the beginning of a twelve-year rivalry with American legend Michelle Kwan, who won gold at this same event.

In the 1994–95 season, Slutskaya continued her rise; after winning the 1995 World Junior title in November 1994 in Budapest, she took bronze at 1995 Russian Championships to qualify for her first senior ISU Championship. At the 1995 European Championships, she came back from a fall in the short program to skate the third best free skating and rose to fifth overall. She qualified for Worlds along with silver medalist Olga Markova, by finishing ahead of Russian champion Maria Butyrskaya (7th). At the 1995 World Championships, Slutskaya again fell in the short program but performed six triples in the next segment, finishing 5th in the free skating and 7th overall.

===1995–96 to 1997–98 seasons===
In the 1995–96 season, Slutskaya competed in the inaugural edition of the Champions Series (later renamed the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating), taking bronze at the 1995 Skate America and placing fourth at the 1995 Trophée de France. In January 1996, at the European Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, she became the first Russian woman to win the European title, performing six triples in the free skating to dethrone the five-time defending champion Surya Bonaly. Slutskaya also won the Centennial on Ice, combining with Butyrskaya to hand Kwan her only defeat of the season. At the Champions Series Final, held in Paris in late February 1996, she finished ahead of reigning World champion Chen Lu (4th) and took the silver medal behind Michelle Kwan. In March, she competed at the 1996 World Championships in Edmonton, Canada. Third in the short program, she held onto her position in the next segment after recovering from an early fall to complete six triples. She was awarded the bronze medal and stepped onto her first world podium, alongside Kwan (gold medalist) and Chen (silver).

In 1996–97, Slutskaya began her season by winning her first Champions Series title at the 1996 Skate Canada International, beating rising star Tara Lipinski. She went on to win two more CS events, the 1996 Nations Cup and 1996 Cup of Russia. In January 1997, she repeated as the European champion, landing seven triples (one with a slightly flawed landing). By the Champions Series Final, held in late February and early March 1997, Slutskaya was struggling with jumps and finished third behind Lipinski, the new U.S. champion, and Kwan. At the 1997 World Championships in Lausanne, a missed combination left her in 6th place in the short program. She then incurred a back injury from a hard fall in practice the day of the free skating. In the free skating, she completed six triples, including a 3S-3Lo combination, and received three first-place votes for the segment. Due to the short program, she finished fourth overall.

In the 1997–98 season, Slutskaya took silver at the 1997 Nations Cup and gold at the 1997 Cup of Russia. In December, she finished off the podium at the Russian Championships and at the Champions Series Final in Munich before winning the silver medal in January 1998 at the European Championships in Milan. In February, she competed at her first Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Ranked fifth in the short program after her planned combination became a 2Lz-2T, Slutskaya performed five triples in the free skating and received two third-place votes (from the U.S. and Hungary) but placed fifth in the segment and overall. Her presentation, however, demonstrated a tendency towards a hunched-over posture and an incompletely-stretched free leg. According to figure skating writer and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum, the Russian folk dance choreography in Slutskaya&#x27;s free skating program emphasized youthful femininity.

The next month, she won silver at the 1998 World Championships, coming back from a fall in the short program and successfully landing two triple-triple combinations in the free skating.

===1998–99 to 2001–02 seasons===
During the 1998–99 season, Slutskaya won a silver and two bronze medals on the Grand Prix series to qualify for her fourth Final. In January 1999, she placed fourth at the 1999 Russian Championships, leading to her omission from the Russian teams to the European and World Championships. She took bronze behind Tatiana Malinina and Butyrskaya at the Grand Prix Final, held in Saint Petersburg in March 1999. Slutskaya then considered leaving the competition but decided to continue.

Slutskaya made a successful comeback in the 1999–2000 season. In December 1999, she defeated Butyrskaya, the reigning world champion, to win her first Russian national title. The following month, she won the Grand Prix Final, defeating both Butyrskaya and Kwan. In second place behind Kwan, ahead of the two-women &quot;super final,&quot; Slutskaya landed seven triples in the final segment, including two triple-triple combinations, and became the first woman to perform a 3Lz-3Lo combination in competition. In February, she won her third European title, in Vienna, Austria. At the 2000 World Championships in Nice, France, Slutskaya won her qualifying pool over Kwan and placed second to Butyrskaya in the short program. She completed six triples in the free skating, with a 2S instead of her planned 3S-3Lo, and finished second overall behind Kwan.

Slutskaya began the 2000–01 season in dominant fashion. After defeating Kwan to win Skate Canada International, she took her fourth European title, in January 2001 in Bratislava, and then defended her Grand Prix Final title, in February in Tokyo. After winning the short program at the 2001 World Championships, in the free skating, she became the first woman to land a 3S-3Lo-2T combination. She two-footed her 3Lz-3Lo-2T combination and had problems on two other landings. The judges voted 7–2 to award the gold medal to Kwan while silver went to Slutskaya.

In the 2001–02 season, Slutskaya won all five of her meetings with Kwan. However, she also saw a new challenge from the 2001 World bronze medalist, Sarah Hughes. After winning her first Goodwill Games title, she finished second to Hughes at Skate Canada International and then took gold at the Cup of Russia. At the Grand Prix Final, Slutskaya performed well to win the first two segments of the event, but her second free skating contained only three clean triples. Three judges placed her third behind Kwan and Hughes, but four others placed her first, giving Slutskaya her third GPF title. She then took her third straight Russian national title but lost her European title to Maria Butyrskaya. Third, in the short program after a fall, she placed first in the free skating but it was not enough to overcome her deficit.

Slutskaya&#x27;s next event was the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Kwan and Slutskaya were ranked first and second in the short program, with Cohen and Hughes placing third and fourth, respectively. After Kwan finished below Hughes in the overall standings, Slutskaya had to place first in the free skating in order to win gold but Hughes won the free skating in a 5–4 decision. Hughes performed seven triples and two triple-triple combinations, while Slutskaya did not attempt any triple-triples and had rough landings on two jumps. Russia, still somewhat aggrieved about the outcome of an earlier dispute over the pairs competition, filed a complaint against the result, but it was rejected shortly. Slutskaya&#x27;s silver was the second medal for a Russian competitor in an Olympic ladies&#x27; figure skating event (Kira Ivanova took bronze at the 1984 Olympics). Later, Russian businessman and politician Anton Bakov awarded Irina a &quot;consolation&quot; custom gold medal completely made of 700 grams of gold.

The next month, Slutskaya won the 2002 World title in Nagano. Ranked first in both the qualifying round and the short program, followed by Fumie Suguri and Michelle Kwan, in theory Slutskaya could place second to Kwan in the free skating and still win the title but she won a majority of the judges&#x27; votes in the segment. It was her first world title.

===2002–03 to 2005–06 seasons: Illness and comeback===

In the 2002–03 season, Slutskaya took silver at the 2002 NHK Trophy and bronze at the 2002 Cup of Russia before losing her national title to Elena Sokolova at the Russian Championships in December 2002. In January 2003, she defeated Sokolova to win her fifth European title in Malmö. The following month, she took silver at the Grand Prix Final in Saint Petersburg after placing first in one segment and second to Sasha Cohen in the other two. Slutskaya decided not to compete at the 2003 World Championships after receiving news that her mother had fallen seriously ill, requiring a kidney transplant. The initial transplant was rejected, and another one had to be performed. Soon after her mother&#x27;s condition began improving, however, Slutskaya experienced severe fatigue and swelling in the legs, which several hospitals struggled to correctly diagnose. She missed most of the 2003–04 season. Although doctors told her that she should stay away from the cold, she elected to compete at the 2004 World Championships and finished ninth. She was diagnosed ultimately with vasculitis.

In 2005, Slutskaya made a comeback after a long stay at a hospital. The season would be her most dominant ever — for the only time in her career she went undefeated, winning every competition she entered. She thrived under the new scoring system, which heavily rewarded her jumps, spins (particularly Biellman spins), difficult footwork, and speed and power. In winning the 2005 European Championships, she matched the record for the most European titles in ladies&#x27; singles. At the 2005 World Championships, Slutskaya was first after the short program and skated last in the free skating, in which she performed seven triples (although one was disallowed due to 3 triple loops being performed), including a 3Lz-3Lo combination, to win her second World title. Often criticized for her lack of artistry, her beautiful and elegant performance also gained the highest PCS (artistry) scores, in addition to the highest technical ones. She said the free skating was &quot;the skate of her life&quot; because &quot;she was in front of her friends and family, and she was skating at home.&quot; She also said:

On 19 January 2006, Slutskaya won the European Championships for the seventh time, breaking the record she had shared with Sonja Henie and Katarina Witt to become the most successful ladies&#x27; skater at the event. At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Slutskaya was considered the odds-on favorite to win the gold medal — 15-year-old Mao Asada, who had upset her at that season&#x27;s Grand Prix Final, was barred from the event due to age regulations. She was in second place after the short program by only 0.03, behind Sasha Cohen of the United States. In the free skating, Slutskaya doubled a triple flip and then fell on a triple loop jump. She won the bronze medal, behind the gold medalist Shizuka Arakawa of Japan and silver medalist Cohen. Slutskaya did not compete at the 2006 World Championships the following month. She originally not planned on competing at the 2006 worlds in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, but decided before the event she would like to compete and vie for a 3rd world title, unfortunately her entry request was deemed too late and she was disallowed to compete. In November 2006, she denied reports that claimed she was retiring from competitive figure skating, saying the reports were completely false. Despite the claims she has not competed since the 2006 Torino Olympics so it seems clear she had in fact retired, but had not yet wanted to make it public.

===Post-competitive career===
On 10 April 2007, Slutskaya announced she was returning to Russia from the United States and would not participate in the 2007 Champions on Ice tour since she and her husband, Sergei, were expecting a child. Slutskaya stated that she enjoyed motherhood and had no plans to return to competitive skating. &quot;I don’t see the target,&quot; she said. &quot;I don’t know why I have to go there. I have almost all the titles.&quot;

She began a career in show business. She presented figure skating reality shows on Russia Channel 1 &quot;Stars on Ice&quot; with co-host Evgeni Plushenko and &quot;Ice Age&quot; with actor Marat Basharov. She has also released a CD. In 2008, she took part in a Russian TV soap opera about figure skating &quot;Hot Ice&quot;. She also toured as the lead skater in the Russian version of the show &quot;Winx on Ice&quot;.

In November 2008, Slutskaya performed in the &quot;Skate from the Heart&quot; show. In 2009, she was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

In 2011, Slutskaya also participated in 2010 Winter Olympic champion Yuna Kim ice show All That Skate Summer. In October 2012, Slutskaya competed in the first Medal Winner&#x27;s Open, an event for Olympic and World medalists. She placed third in the ladies&#x27; field. She was an ambassador for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

==Political career==

In 2016, Slutskaya participated in the United Russia party primaries for nomination as a candidate for deputy of the Moscow Oblast Duma in the Pushkin single-mandate constituency No. 17 of the Moscow Region from this party. In September 2016, she became deputy of the Moscow Oblast Duma from the United Russia party.

==Personal life==
Slutskaya was born in 1979 in Moscow, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, the only child of a Russian mother and Russian Jewish father. Slutskaya was raised in the Russian Orthodox faith and was known to cross herself in most of her competitions. Her mother was a former cross-country skier for the Soviet Union.

Slutskaya married her boyfriend, Sergei Mikheev, in August 1999. They met each other three years earlier at a summer camp near Moscow, where Mikheev was a physical education instructor. She gave birth to a son, Artem, in November 2007 in Moscow. An only child who longed for siblings, she said she would like another baby. In October 2010, she gave birth to their second child, a daughter named Varvara. In 2016 Slutskaya and Mikheev divorced after seventeen years of marriage.

She married a businessman named Alexei Govyrin in June 2018. In October 2019, she gave birth to her third child and first with Govyrin, a daughter named Kira.

<text>Robert Francis McMullan (born 10 December 1947) is a former Australian politician. A member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), he was a cabinet minister in the Keating government as Minister for Arts and Administrative Services (1993–1994) and Minister for Trade (1994–1996). He was a member of federal parliament for over 22 years, initially as a Senator for the Australian Capital Territory from 1988 to 1996 and then as a member of the House of Representatives from 1996 to 2010. Prior to entering parliament he was state secretary of the ALP in Western Australia from 1975 to 1981 and national secretary from 1981 to 1988.

==Early life==
McMullan was born in Perth on 10 December 1947. He attended Guildford Primary School and Governor Stirling Senior High School. He was raised in a working-class family; his older brothers left school prematurely to support the family, but he was able to continue to Year 12 after receiving a state government bursary.

McMullan graduated from the University of Western Australia with a Bachelor of Arts in economics and a Bachelor of Economics in industrial relations. He was the first member of his family to attend university. He was active in the movement against the Vietnam War and was conscripted for military service in 1968 but successfully argued in court that he was a conscientious objector. After university he tutored in industrial relations and worked as a freelance industrial advocate from 1971 to 1973.

==Early political involvement==
McMullan joined the Australian Labor Party in 1967 while at university. Active in student politics, he was elected to the ALP state executive the following year and in 1971 became the state president of Young Labor.

McMullan was appointed state secretary of the Western Australian branch of the ALP in 1975. He was elected national secretary in 1981, and moved to Canberra. His tenure included the ALP&#x27;s victory at the 1983, 1984 and 1987 federal elections. In December 1987 he announced he would seek ALP preselection to fill the casual vacancy caused by Susan Ryan&#x27;s resignation from the Senate.

==Parliamentary career==
On 16 February 1988, McMullan was chosen by a joint sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate to fill a casual vacancy in the representation of the Australian Capital Territory in the Senate, caused by the resignation of Susan Ryan. This was the second (and last) time that a territory senate vacancy was filled in this way.

McMullan was Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer 1990–93, Minister for the Arts and Minister for Administrative Services 1993–94, Minister for Administrative Services 1994 and Minister for Trade 1994–96 in the government of Paul Keating.

As Arts Minister he was shadowed by Opposition leader John Hewson who had appointed himself as Shadow Arts Minister.

On 6 February 1996 he resigned his Senate seat in order to contest the Division of Canberra in the House of Representatives at the March election; he was successful. He was the first person to represent the Australian Capital Territory in both houses of federal parliament. The Keating government having been defeated by John Howard, Labor went into opposition and McMullan was elected as a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry. In 1998, following a redistribution, McMullan moved to the neighbouring seat of Fraser. 

McMullan became Manager of Opposition Business (opposite number to the Leader of the House) in 1998, and following Labor&#x27;s 2001 electoral defeat he was made Shadow Treasurer. In July 2003 McMullan was replaced as Shadow Treasurer by Mark Latham and relegated to the post of Shadow Minister for Finance, taking on additional responsibility for Reconciliation and Indigenous Affairs. McMullan then became Shadow Minister for Finance and Shadow Minister for Small Business. 

In Question Time in Parliament, McMullan gained a reputation for repeatedly asking the same question in different words if he did not get a direct answer. After the 2004 election, McMullan did not stand for election to the Shadow Cabinet, in what was widely seen as an expression of lack of confidence in the leadership of Mark Latham.

Following the election of Kevin Rudd on 4 December 2006 as Opposition Leader in place of Kim Beazley, McMullan returned to the front bench in the junior role of Labor spokesperson on Federal-State Relations, the reform of which was one of Rudd&#x27;s declared priorities.

In the 2007 federal election McMullan held his seat of Fraser, albeit with a two-party preferred swing to Labor of less than 2%, one-third of the national average swing to Labor.

When the First Rudd Ministry was sworn in on 3 December 2007, McMullan was given the junior post of Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance. On 19 January 2010, McMullan announced he would not contest the next federal election. He retired prior to the 2010 federal election.

<doc id="559891" wikidata="Q1637234" url="?curid=559891" title="Humphrey (cat)">
<text>Humphrey ( – March 2006) was a cat employed as the chief mouser to the Cabinet Office at 10 Downing Street from October 1989 to 13 November 1997. Arriving as a one-year-old stray, he served under the premierships of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair, retiring six months after the Blairs moved into Downing Street. He was the successor to Wilberforce. Humphrey was frequently referred to in jest by the press as an actual employee at Number 10.

==Career==
Humphrey was found as a stray by a Cabinet Office civil servant and named in honour of Humphrey Appleby, the archetypal civil servant of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;. After the death of the previous mouser, Wilberforce in 1988, the Cabinet Office and Number 10 were in need of a replacement and so Humphrey began his work. At a cost of about £100 a year (paid for from the Cabinet Office&#x27;s budget), most of which went towards food, Humphrey was said to be of considerably better value than the Cabinet&#x27;s professional pest controller, who charged £4,000 a year and is reported to have never caught a mouse.

Frequently pictured posing by the famous Number 10 front door, Humphrey&#x27;s primary duties involved catching mice and rats in the maze of Downing Street buildings. The poor quality of the buildings, some of which date from the 16th century, and the nearby St. James&#x27;s Park ensure a continuous vermin problem. By the time of his retirement, Humphrey had risen to the position of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. In November 1993, an internal memo was circulated in the Cabinet Office informing staff that Humphrey was suffering from a minor kidney complaint and had been put on a special diet. A ban on feeding him treats was instituted.

Humphrey was accused on 7 June 1994 of having killed four robin chicks which were nesting in a window box outside the office of John Major, then Prime Minister. However, Major exonerated him the next day, declaring, &quot;I am afraid Humphrey has been falsely accused.&quot; It was not until March 2006 that he was finally cleared: journalist George Jones of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; admitted that his piece in the paper&#x27;s diary column had been no more than &quot;journalistic licence&quot; printed with no supporting evidence. In September 1994, Humphrey was found in St James&#x27;s Park and was blamed for having &quot;savaged&quot; a duck there, earlier in the year.

In June 1995, Humphrey went missing. Downing Street did not disclose the fact until it was mentioned to Sheila Gunn, a journalist on &quot;The Times&quot;, after Gunn told a member of staff that her own cat had died. Gunn&#x27;s story was mentioned on the front page. The publicity led to his rediscovery in the nearby Royal Army Medical College, where he had been taken in as a presumed stray and renamed PC, short for &quot;patrol cat&quot;. Upon his return, Humphrey issued a statement through the civil service: &quot;I have had a wonderful holiday at the Royal Army Medical College, but it is nice to be back and I am looking forward to the new parliamentary session.&quot;

Within a week of Tony Blair moving to 10 Downing Street after the May 1997 general election, there were press reports of a rift between Humphrey and Cherie Blair, the new Prime Minister&#x27;s wife. Cherie Blair was reported either to be allergic to cats or to believe them to be unhygienic. Sheila Gunn, who had gone on to be John Major&#x27;s press advisor, later admitted that she was the source of these reports, which her obituary says were based &quot;on a hunch for which she had no evidence&quot;.

At the time, a spokesperson insisted that Humphrey would not be moving out, stating that Number 10 &quot;is Humphrey&#x27;s home and, as far as the Blairs are concerned, it will remain his home&quot;. A photo of Humphrey and Cherie Blair was released, though this did little to allay fears that he would be forced out. It was later alleged that Humphrey was sedated by press secretary Alastair Campbell before undergoing the ordeal. The photo was used on the cover of &quot;Private Eye&quot; with Humphrey stating &quot;I am going to hit the mouse running&quot; a paraphrase of a New Labourism. In November 1997, Humphrey&#x27;s primary carer, Jonathan Rees, who worked in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Policy Unit, wrote a memo stating that the cat should retire to a &quot;stable home environment where he can be looked after properly&quot;.

==Retirement==
Humphrey moved to his new home with an elderly couple in suburban London on 13 November 1997, though his retirement was not announced until the next day to reduce the risk of kidnap attempts. The Conservatives were quick to point out that Humphrey lived happily at Number 10 for almost eight years under a Conservative government but moved out within six months of Labour taking power. Conservative MP and animal lover Alan Clark was suspicious about the way Humphrey&#x27;s retirement was announced and demanded proof that the cat was still alive: &quot;Humphrey is now a missing person. Unless I hear from him or he makes a public appearance, I suspect he has been shot.&quot; This led to rumours that Humphrey had been put down on the orders of Cherie Blair. The Prime Minister&#x27;s office insisted that veterinary advice was behind the decision to remove Humphrey from Downing Street, and on 24 November 1997 a group of journalists were taken to a secret location in south London and shown that Humphrey was still alive and well. Pictures of the cat posing with copies of the day&#x27;s newspapers were published and reports indicated that he had put on weight.

Little was heard about Humphrey over the next few years, leading many to infer that he had died. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; made a Freedom of Information Act request for documents relating to him in early 2005, which led to more information about his time at Downing Street coming to light. In March 2005, in its report about Humphrey, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; lamented &quot;Where Humphrey is now – or even whether he is still with us – remains a mystery. &#x27;I am not having much luck,&#x27; a Cabinet Office spokesman confessed last night. His official minder has not heard from him in seven years.&quot; However, on 22 July 2005, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that &quot;the 17 year old mouser is alive and well and living in South London.&quot; No further details were given in the text, which was part of a larger feature about celebrity pets. In March 2006, a spokesman for Tony Blair reported that Humphrey had died during the previous week, at the home of the Cabinet Office worker who had been accommodating him.

==In popular culture==
In August 2012, the BBC Radio 4 dramatic series &quot;Political Animals&quot; featured Humphrey, focusing on the Blair years. Humphrey also appeared in the political satire &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, portrayed as a cat who would irritate John Major by criticising the government. This would lead to a confrontation between Humphrey and Major, resulting in Major knocking Humphrey unconscious with a frying pan.

<doc id="559908" wikidata="Q3828157" url="?curid=559908" title="Lawrence Stager">
<text>Lawrence E. &quot;Larry&quot; Stager (January 5, 1943 – December 29, 2017) was an American archaeologist and academic, specialising in Syro-Palestinian archaeology and Biblical archaeology. He was the Dorot Professor of the Archaeology of Israel in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations at Harvard University and was Director of the Harvard Semitic Museum. Beginning in 1985 he oversaw the excavations of the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon, the Philistine port city.

==Education==
Stager was a first-generation college student from Kenton, Ohio, about fifty miles northwest of Columbus, Ohio. He was recruited by the Harvard Club of Dayton, Ohio to attend Harvard University, where he graduated a BA &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1965. Stager then received both his MA and PhD from Harvard, where he worked largely under the supervision of Frank Moore Cross and G. Ernest Wright, both students of William F. Albright. The title of his thesis was &quot;Ancient Agriculture in the Judaean Desert: A Case Study of the Buqê&#x27;ah Valley in the Iron Age&quot;.

==Academic positions==
After receiving his PhD, Stager was first employed by the University of Chicago, where he taught and researched for the next fourteen years as a member of the Oriental Institute, first as an instructor (1973-4), then as an assistant (1974-6), associate (1976–1985), and finally full professor (1985-6).

In 1986, Stager returned to Harvard, where he became the inaugural holder of an endowed chair, the Dorot Professorship of the Archaeology of Israel. Stager taught courses in Syro-Palestinian archaeology and Hebrew Bible and was an active professional member of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR).

In 2009, a Festschrift for Stager was published under the title &quot;Exploring the Longue Durée: Essays in Honor of Lawrence E. Stager&quot; (Ed. J. David Schloen; Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns).

==Archaeological work==
Stager&#x27;s most important archaeological work was conducted through the Leon Levy Expedition to Ascalon, of which he became the director in 1985. This expedition is one of the largest and lengthiest projects in Israel. The results of the dig have been published in the Harvard Semitic Museum and Eisenbrauns&#x27; &quot;Ashkelon&quot;, a series of ten volumes, the third of which was published in 2011.

Prior to his monumental undertakings at Ashkelon, Stager worked on digs at Carthage, Idalion, Gezer, and Tell el-Hesi. 

Stager generally adhered to the traditional scholarly dating of the &quot;United Monarchy&quot; of King David and Solomon.

<doc id="559918" wikidata="Q2382055" url="?curid=559918" title="Beate Sirota Gordon">
<text>Beate Sirota Gordon (; October 25, 1923 – December 30, 2012) was an Austrian and American performing arts presenter and women&#x27;s rights advocate. Born in Vienna, Austria, she moved to the Empire of Japan in 1929 with her father, the pianist Leo Sirota. After graduating from the American School in Japan, she moved to Oakland, California, where she enrolled at Mills College. Being one of the few people not of Japanese descent who was fluent in Japanese, she obtained work Office of War Information in the Foreign Broadcast Information Service of the Federal Communications Commission.

Sirota Gordon returned to Japan after the end of the war, assigned as translator to Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers. She later was recruited to be one of the writers of Japan&#x27;s postwar constitution, where she played an integral role in its mandating of equality between the sexes.

Following Sirota Gordon&#x27;s return to the United States in 1948, she married and eventually became the performing arts director of the Japan Society and the Asia Society. In this role, she fomented interest in Japanese art and artists in the United States. She retired in 1991.

==Early life and education==
Born in Vienna on October 25, 1923 and educated in Tokyo, Beate Sirota was the only child of pianist Leo and Augustine Sirota (&quot;née&quot; Horenstein), Russians of Jewish descent. Leo had emigrated from Russia because of anti-Semitic violence and settled in Austria-Hungary. Her maternal uncle was conductor Jascha Horenstein. Sirota&#x27;s family emigrated to Japan in 1929, when Leo Sirota accepted an invitation to become a professor at the Imperial Academy of Music – now Tokyo University of the Arts – in Tokyo. She attended the German School in Tokyo for six years, until the age of twelve, when she transferred to American School in Japan (also in Tokyo) as a result of her parents deeming the German School &quot;too Nazi&quot;. Beate Sirota lived in Tokyo a total of ten years before she moved to Oakland, California, in 1939 to attend Mills College, where she was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa society, and graduated in 1943 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in modern languages. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 1945.

==World War II and Japan==
During World War II, Sirota was completely cut off from her parents in Japan. She later said that in the U.S. in 1940, she was one of only sixty-five Caucasians who were fluent in Japanese. During the war, she worked for the Office of War Information in the Foreign Broadcast Information Service of the Federal Communications Commission. She also worked for &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

As soon as the war ended, Sirota went to Japan in search of her parents, who survived the war as internees in Karuizawa, Nagano. On Christmas Eve, 1945, she was the first civilian woman to arrive in post-war Japan. Assigned to the Political Affairs staff, she worked for Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s occupation army as a translator. In addition to Japanese, she was fluent in English, German, French, and Russian.

When the U.S. began drafting a new constitution for Japan in February 1946, Sirota was enlisted to help and was assigned to the subcommittee dedicated to writing the section of the constitution devoted to civil rights. She was one of only two women in the larger group, the other being economist Eleanor Hadley. Sirota played an integral role, drafting the language regarding legal equality between men and women in Japan, including Articles 14 and 24 on Equal Rights and Women&#x27;s Civil Rights. Article 14 states, in part: &quot;All of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin&quot;. Article 24 includes:

Marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes and it shall be maintained through mutual cooperation with the equal rights of husband and wife as a basis. 2) With regard to choice of spouse, property rights, inheritance, choice of domicile, divorce and other matters pertaining to marriage and the family, laws shall be enacted from the standpoint of individual dignity and the essential equality of the sexes.

These additions to the constitution were vital to women&#x27;s rights in Japan. &quot;Japanese women were historically treated like chattel; they were property to be bought and sold on a whim,&quot; Gordon said in 1999.

Sirota, as interpreter on MacArthur&#x27;s staff, was the only woman present during the negotiations between the Japanese Steering Committee and the American team.

In 1947, Sirota was a target of Major General Charles A. Willoughby&#x27;s year-long investigation of leftist infiltration, in which he tried to construct a case against Sirota, charging her with advancing the Communist cause within the new government of Japan.

==Performing arts==
After returning to the United States with her parents, in 1948, Beate Sirota married Lieutenant Joseph Gordon, who had been chief of the interpreter–translator team for the military intelligence section at the Allied Supreme Commander GHQ and was also present for the negotiations on the constitution. Settling in New York in 1947, she took a number of jobs, including one at &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Gordon eventually returned to her primary interest, the performing arts. She had studied ballet, modern, ethnic, and folk dance, as well as piano and drama in Tokyo and at Mills. While raising her two young children, she joined the reactivated Japan Society in New York City in 1954 as Director of Student Programs, providing career and job counseling to Japanese students in New York. One of the students was Yoko Ono, with whom she maintained a lifelong friendship. She also worked with visual artists, arranging exhibits and lecture-demonstrations, including the first American visit of the renowned woodblock artist, Shikō Munakata. In 1958 she was appointed the Society&#x27;s Director of Performing Arts. In this capacity she introduced a number of Japanese performing artists to the New York public, helping to develop many careers. Among these artists were Toshi Ichiyanagi, now one of Japan&#x27;s foremost composers and Suzushi Hanayagi, whom she introduced to the theater director Robert Wilson, with whom Hanayagi collaborated on the &quot;Knee Plays&quot;, and other works. In addition, in 1960, Gordon became a consultant to the Asia Society performing arts program, expanding her activities from Japan to the other countries of Asia.

Gordon was also a consultant and adviser to producers such as Harold Prince for his production of the Stephen Sondheim musical, &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot;. In the early 1960s, she was influential in bringing koto music to the attention of Americans by introducing composer Henry Cowell to the great Japanese koto player, Kimio Eto. Cowell subsequently wrote a concerto for koto and orchestra for Eto which was presented by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra in New York, Philadelphia, and on tour. Gordon also produced the first Asian performances at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.

Gordon&#x27;s travels in search of authentic performing arts from Asia took her to such remote areas as Purulia in West Bengal, India, and Kuching in Sarawak, Malaysia, where she sought out indigenous performing artists to bring to universities, museums, and other cultural venues in New York and across the United States and Canada. Over the years, Gordon produced 39 tours by 34 companies from 16 countries. These performances, which were seen by an estimated 1.5 million Americans in some 400 cities and towns in 42 states, brought new ways of experiencing Asian performing arts to audiences throughout the country. They also intensified the post-World War II Asian influence on American art, design, music, literature, and theater.

For the media, Gordon produced and hosted a series of 12 half-hour programs on the Japanese arts broadcast on New York&#x27;s Channel 13 and served as commentator for a series of four hour-long programs featuring traditional and popular music from Japan, China, India, and Thailand which were broadcast on Channel 31, New York City&#x27;s municipal television station. She also produced 29 video tapes and five films televised nationally. For the Nonesuch Records Explorer Series, she produced eight albums of Asian music. Gordon served on the panel of, and was subsequently a consultant for, the Dance Program of the National Endowment for the Arts. She was also the Associate Editor in charge of the Asian Dance section of the &quot;International Encyclopedia of Dance&quot; published by Oxford University Press in February, 1998.

==Honors, retirement and legacy==
For her work as an arts presenter, and for associated activities such as production of video tapes, records, and scholarly monographs on various Asian art forms, Gordon received numerous awards, among them the American Dance Guild Award (1978), two Dance on Camera Festival Awards (1984, 1985), an Obie Award for the introduction of Samul Nori to the United States (1985); a Bessie Award (1990) which cited her &quot;for beating an ever-widening path between the cultures of East and West and for understanding the essential creative dialectic between tradition and experimentation and the fundamental partnership of artists involved in both&quot;; the 2005 Ryoko Akamatsu Award, the Avon Grand Award to Women&#x27;s Award (1997), and the John D. Rockefeller Award from the Asian Cultural Council (1997) which gave &quot;recognition of your extraordinary contributions in introducing American scholars, artists, and general audiences to the performing arts of Asia and in increasing the American understanding and appreciation of Asian dance, theater, and music traditions.&quot;
Gordon retired from the directorship at the Asia Society in 1991, continuing as Senior Consultant for Performing Arts until July 1993. She received an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Mills College in 1991, and the President&#x27;s Medal from the College of the City of New York in 1992. In November 1998 she received the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Gold Rays with Rosette, from the Japanese government. She also received an honorary Doctor of Law degree from Smith College in 2008, and was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from Mills College in 2011, where a collection of her papers now resides.

The Japanese television network, Asahi Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), produced a 90-minute documentary on Gordon&#x27;s life, first broadcast in Japan on May 22, 1993. A Japanese-language biography, &quot;Christmas 1945: The Biography of the Woman Who Wrote the Equal Rights Clause of the Japanese Constitution&quot;, was published on October 20, 1995. The English version of this book was published in March 1998 under the title &quot;The Only Woman in the Room: A Memoir&quot;. A play based on Gordon&#x27;s role in writing the Japanese constitution, &quot;A String of Pearls&quot; by James Miki, was performed by the Seinen Gekijo in Tokyo, in April 1998. Gordon also lectured extensively in the United States and in Japan on her role in writing the Japanese constitution.

The film &quot;The Sirota Family and the 20th Century&quot;, produced by Tomoko Fujiwara, made its debut in the West in Paris in April 2009. It is the story of Gordon&#x27;s father&#x27;s family and their flight from Europe into the diaspora.

Minor planet 5559 Beategordon discovered by Eleanor Helin is named in her honor. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 8 November 2019 ().

Jeff Gottesfeld published a 2020 book for children, celebrating Gordon&#x27;s activism and documenting the historical struggle for equal rights.

==Death==
Gordon died of pancreatic cancer at her home in Manhattan, New York City on December 30, 2012, at the age of 89. Her last public statement was to urge that the peace and women&#x27;s rights clauses of the Japanese Constitution be preserved. Her husband, Joseph Gordon, had died four months earlier, on August 29, 2012, at the age of 93.

<doc id="559932" wikidata="Q6939922" url="?curid=559932" title="Musa Ghiatuddin Riayat Shah of Selangor">
<text>Sultan Musa Ghiatuddin Riayat Shah Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman Shah (born Tengku Musa Eddin; Jawi: ; 9 December 1893 – 8 November 1955) was Sultan of Selangor in Malaysia during the Japanese occupation of Selangor (1942–1945). He received the Order of the Rising Sun from the Emperor of Japan, Hirohito.

==Early life==

Tengku Musa Eddin was born in the Istana Temasya Jugra, Kuala Langat and was the eldest son of Sultan Alaeddin (1863–1938) by his royal consort Tengku Ampuan Maharum binti Raja Muda Tunku Dziauddin of Kedah.

Educated privately, he was made &quot;tengku mahkota&quot; in 1903. He succeeded his father&#x27;s great-uncle Raja Laut bin Sultan Muhammad as Raja Muda (Crown Prince) of Selangor in 1920. An intelligent young man, he represented his father on the State Council established by the British colonial authority.

However, at the instigation of the British Resident, Theodore Samuel Adams (1885–1961; in office 1935–1937), Tengku Musa Eddin was dismissed as raja muda in 1934 for alleged &quot;misbehaviour&quot;. Adams had accused Tengku Musa Eddin of being a spendthrift and wastrel with a penchant for gambling. However, many Malays in Selangor believed the real reason for Tengku Musa Eddin&#x27;s dismissal was his refusal to follow Adams&#x27; orders.

Although Sultan Sulaiman pleaded for the case of Tengku Musa Eddin (even petitioning the Secretary of State for the Colonies and discussing the issue directly with him in London), Tengku Alam Shah was proclaimed raja muda over his other half-brother Tengku Badar. The appointment occurred on 20 July 1936.

Tengku Musa Eddin was given the title of &quot;Tengku Kelana Jaya Putera&quot;, ironically the title for the heir-apparent of the Yang di-Pertuan Muda (or &quot;Under-King&quot;) of Johor and Riau, from which the sultans of Selangor are descended.

Tengku Alam Shah was proclaimed sultan on 4 April 1938, four days after the death of his father. On 26 January 1939, he was crowned at the Istana Mahkota Puri Negara in Klang. Tengku Musa Eddin presided over the ceremony.

On 15 January 1942, during the Japanese occupation of Malaya, Colonel Fujiyama, the Japanese Military Governor of Selangor, invited Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah to King&#x27;s House in Kuala Lumpur. In an interview with Major-General Minaki the Sultan confessed that he had made speeches in support of the British war efforts but had been persuaded by the British Resident to do so.

After being told to surrender the regalia to his older brother, the Japanese removed Sultan Hisamuddin and in November 1943, proclaimed Tengku Musa Eddin as the new Sultan of Selangor, taking the regnal name Sultan Musa Ghiatuddin Riayat Shah.

Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah declined to work with the Japanese and from 1943, refused the allowance they gave him and his children.

After the war, Sultan Musa was dethroned by the British Military Administration under Lord Louis Mountbatten upon their return to Malaya in 1945. Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah was reinstalled as Sultan of Selangor.

==Death==

Sultan Musa was exiled to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Subsequently, he fell ill and was brought back to Selangor a few months before he died on 8 November 1955 in Kuala Lumpur. Sultan Musa was buried beside his father at the Royal Mausoleum in Klang. His consort, Syarifah Mastura Shahabuddin of Kedah, became Tengku Permaisuri or Queen during his brief reign. She died in 1958. The couple had no children.

<text>The Queen of Malaysia, officially Raja Permaisuri Agong ( Jawi: ) is the consort of the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot;, the elected, constitutional federal monarch of Malaysia.

==Title and precedence==

The queen&#x27;s full style and title in Malay is .

* literally means &#x27;Under the dust of the Almighty&#x27;, referring to how the Raja Permaisuri Agong&#x27;s power and prestige is dust compared to God&#x27;s power and the ruler and his consort are always subservient to God.
* refers to &quot;Seri&quot; as in a person. &quot;Paduka&quot; means victorious and the term &quot;Baginda&quot; is the Malay possessive pronoun for a royal in the third person.
* in literal English is the &quot;Supreme Queen&quot;. It is an archaic equivalent to Raja where the female is a &quot;Raja Permaisuri&quot; and &quot;Agong&quot; (or in standard Malay) means &#x27;supreme&#x27;. The term &quot;Agong&quot; is not translated, as in the Constitution of Malaysia. The Malay word &quot;permaisuri&quot; is derived from Sanskrit परमेश्वरी (&quot;parameśvarī&quot;), &#x27;supreme lady&#x27;.

Common English terms used in the media and by the general public include &quot;Supreme Queen&quot; and &quot;Paramount Consort&quot;.

In formal English correspondence, for many years the queen was referred to as &quot;Her Majesty The Raja Permaisuri Agong&quot;. In January 2024, this was changed to &quot;Her Majesty The Queen of Malaysia&quot;.

There are two formal ways of addressing the queen:

* Malay: &quot;Tuanku&quot; (literally &#x27;My Lady&#x27;)
* English: Your Majesty

The queen immediately follows her husband, the king, in the Malaysian order of precedence.

==Status, functions, and privileges==
The king is elected (&quot;de facto&quot; rotated) every five years from among the nine hereditary rulers of the states of Malaysia by the Conference of Rulers. When a ruler is elected to the office of king, his consort is automatically bestowed the title and dignity of queen and serves the same term of office as her husband. In effect, the holder of the title of Queen of Malaysia changes every five years, though it could happen earlier due to the death or abdication of the king during his term of office.

Like many spouses of heads of state, the queen has no stipulated role in the Constitution of Malaysia. She accompanies the king to official functions and state visits, as well as hosting visiting heads of state and their spouses during their visits to Malaysia. Article 34 of the Malaysian Constitution forbids the queen from holding any appointment, carrying any remuneration, or actively engaging in any commercial enterprise during her tenure. The queen is, however, legally entitled to an annual payment which is included in the Civil List of the king during his term of office.

Previous holders of the title of Queen of Malaysia whose husbands are deceased receive a pension from the Federal Government&#x27;s Civil List. They also take precedence immediately after the reigning king, the current queen, the reigning monarchs of royal states, and the (governors) of non-royal states.

==List of queens of Malaysia==
The following consorts have served in the office of queen:

* Elective monarchy
* King of Malaysia — &quot;consort&#x27;s spouse + monarch−ruler of Malaysia&quot;.
* Malay styles and titles — &quot;on Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo within Brunei + Malaysia&quot;.
* Regalia of Malaysia
* Yang di-Pertuan Negara — &quot;national Malaysian award for elected monarchs&quot;.

<doc id="559956" wikidata="Q3876900" url="?curid=559956" title="Woore">
<text>Woore ( ) is a village and civil parish in the north east of Shropshire, England. The population of the village as recorded in the 2011 census is 633, and for the civil parish is 1,069. The civil parish extends to about 3,950 acres (1,600 hectares). 

==Etymology==

The name means &quot;boundary&quot; in ancient Celtic or Anglo-Saxon (&quot;Oure&quot;), and this fits nicely with the fact that it is on the boundary with both the counties of Cheshire and Staffordshire. The parish is the most northerly in Shropshire.

==Location==
The nearest significant towns to Woore are Market Drayton, Whitchurch, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Nantwich and Crewe. The A51 and A525 roads run through the village, the A51 being the old London - Chester post road. (Changes of horses used to be available at the former Swan Inn, now flats, in the centre of Woore itself.) The only road links between Woore and the rest of Shropshire pass through adjoining counties. The village is also the farthest place in Shropshire from the centre of the county near Cantlop.

==History==
The Domesday Book (1086) entry for Woore (“Waure”) shows that the manor was held not from Earl Roger of Shrewsbury, but as a tenant-in-chief from the King, by William Malbedeng (William Malbank), and contained a large hall within the moated site at what is now Syllenhurst Farm. Lying in the Hundred of Hodnet, there were 5 households in Woore itself, the value of which to the Lord was assessed for tax at 5 shillings, with woodland for 60 pigs. William Malbank also held land at Dorrington (2 households with land for 3 ploughlands, woodland for 100 pigs, valued at 4 shillings), Gravenhunger (2 households with land for 4 ploughlands, valued at 6 shillings) and Onneley (no households, valued at less than 2 shillings). He had succeeded a pre-Conquest Saxon Lord, Edric. In later medieval times the most notable family of Woore was the de Bulkeleys.

===Racecourse===

The village had a National Hunt racecourse until 1963, served by Pipe Gate railway station in the south of the parish, which was closed under the Beeching &quot;Axe&quot;.

==Modern day==
The village today is mostly residential with a number of small shops, centred on the Post Office and general stores on the village square. Two public houses service the village, along with one modern red brick primary school and two churches, the smaller of which is a Methodist church, popularly known as &quot;the Chapel on the corner&quot;, and the larger of which is St. Leonard&#x27;s Church of England parish church.

Woore Cricket Club play at the Falcon Field in the village, which slopes downwards dramatically from the Pavilion and Falcon Inn sides.

Bridgemere Garden World is to the north of Woore, just over the border in Cheshire.

==St Leonard&#x27;s Church==
St. Leonard&#x27;s church was constructed in about 1830–31, to serve what were then five townships of the Shropshire portion of the ancient parish of Mucklestone in Staffordshire, and is of an unconventional white plaster Italianate design. A Grade II listed building, it was repainted in 2011. Designed by George Hamilton of Stone, the bell tower is an Edwardian addition by Chapman and Snape of Newcastle-under-Lyme. The tower has not been safe to regularly ring in since the late 1980s, with the bells now replaced by a timed recording. The churchyard contains a war grave of a British soldier of World War I.

==Transport==
Woore no longer has bus services. It was previously served by a bus connecting the village with Hanley and Nantwich, however the service ceased in 2015. Now the nearby village of Buerton has bus links to Nantwich, Whitchurch (Shropshire) and Audlem. The other is the village of Madeley (Staffordshire) which provides links to Newcastle-Under-Lyme, Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent.

There is no railway station in Woore but there was a station in the village of Pipe Gate which was on the now-closed Stoke-Market Drayton Line. The station closed in 1957 along with the section to Market Drayton but the line from Silverdale to Pipe Gate remained open to serve both a creamery and as a loop back to the mainline at Madeley Chord until 1998 when the entire line closed after closure of Silverdale Colliery. The line has been mothballed and the bridge demolished. The station master&#x27;s house survives as a private residence but the station site is now a timber yard. Part of the embankment is still present but the section towards Market Drayton is built on by a new housing development. This does not however hinder possible future proposals for reopening of the line.

==Notable residents==
* William Bridges Adams (1797 in Woore – 1872) author, locomotive engineer and inventor of the Adams axle
* Albert Lightfoot (born 1936 in Woore) a cricketer for Northamptonshire
* John Lawton (1936 in Woore – 2017) footballer, played 9 games for Stoke City F.C
* Nick Hancock (born 1962) TV personality owned a £1.1m mansion near Woore

== Civil parish ==
The civil parish includes several other hamlets and villages including Gravenhunger, Dorrington, Pipe Gate, Bearstone, part of Onneley (the remainder being in the neighbouring Staffordshire Parish of Madeley) and Ireland&#x27;s Cross.

The parish council has 10 elected members, and normally meets monthly, on the first Monday of the month.

Woore is within Market Drayton East ward for elections to Shropshire Council.

<doc id="559959" wikidata="Q589442" url="?curid=559959" title="Douglas XB-42 Mixmaster">
<text>The Douglas XB-42 Mixmaster is an experimental American bomber aircraft, designed for a high top speed. The unconventional approach was to mount the two engines within the fuselage driving a pair of contra-rotating propellers mounted at the tail in a pusher configuration, leaving the wing and fuselage clean and free of drag-inducing protrusions.

Two prototype aircraft were built, but the end of World War II changed priorities and the advent of the jet engine gave an alternative way toward achieving high speed.

==Design and development==
The XB-42 was developed initially as a private venture; an unsolicited proposal was presented to the United States Army Air Forces in May 1943. This resulted in an Air Force contract for two prototypes and one static test airframe, the USAAF seeing an intriguing possibility of finding a bomber capable of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress&#x27;s range without its size or cost.

The aircraft mounted a pair of Allison V-1710-125 liquid-cooled V-12 engines behind the crew&#x27;s cabin, each driving one of the twin propellers. Air intakes were in the wing leading edge. The landing gear was tricycle and a full, four surface cruciform tail was fitted, whose ventral fin/rudder unit incorporated a tailwheel to prevent the coaxial propellers from striking the ground. The pilot and co-pilot sat under twin bubble canopies, and the bombardier sat in the extreme front behind a plexiglass nose.

Defensive armament consisted of two 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns each side in the trailing edge of the wing, which retracted into the wing when not in use. These guns were aimed by the copilot through a sighting station at the rear of his cockpit. The guns had a limited field of fire (25 degrees left right and +20 -15 in elevation) to the rear, but with the aircraft&#x27;s high speed it was thought unlikely that intercepting fighters would attack from any other angle.

Two guns were fitted to fire directly forward. Initially ordered as an attack aircraft (XA-42) in the summer of 1943, this variant would have been armed with 16 machine guns or a 75 mm (2.95 in) cannon and two machine guns.

Considering the danger of bailing out and being pushed into the rear propellers, designers installed an explosive arrangement to sever the props from the tailcone in event of an emergency.

==Operational history==

The first XB-42 (43-50224) was delivered to the USAAF and flew at Palm Springs, California on 6 May 1944. Performance was excellent, being basically as described in the original proposal: as fast as the de Havilland Mosquito B.XVI but with defensive armament and twice the bombload over short distances. The twin bubble canopies proved a bad idea as communications were adversely affected and a single bubble canopy was substituted after the first flight of the second prototype.

Testing revealed that the XB-42 suffered from some instability as excessive yaw was encountered, as well as propeller vibration and poor engine cooling - all problems that could probably have been dealt with. Due to the ventral vertical stabilizer and rudder surface set&#x27;s tip being located underneath the fuselage, careful handling during taxiing, takeoff, and landing was required because of limited ground clearance. An integral shock absorber was added to the ventral fin to reduce excessive bending force in the tailcone from a ground strike.

The end of World War II allowed the USAAF more time to develop new aircraft, and leaders decided to wait for the development of better jet bombers rather than continue with the B-42 program.

In December 1945, Captain Glen Edwards and Lt. Col. Henry E. Warden set a transcontinental speed record by flying the second prototype XB-42 (43-50225) from Long Beach, California to Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C. (c. 2,300 miles). In 5:17 hrs, the XB-42 set a speed record of 433.6 mph (697.8 km/h).

The record-breaking XB-42 prototype was destroyed in a crash on 16 December. On a routine flight out of Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., suffered in short order, a landing gear extension problem, failure of the left engine, and as coolant temperatures rose, failure of the right engine. Major Hayduck bailed out at 1,200 feet, Lt. Col. Haney at 800 feet, and the pilot Lt. Col. Fred J. Ascani, after crawling aft to jettison the pusher propellers, at 400 feet – all three survived. The aircraft crashed at Oxon Hill, Maryland. The classified jettisonable propeller technology caused a problem for authorities in explaining what witnesses on the ground thought was the aircraft exploding. Possible fuel management problems were speculated, but this hypothesis was never proven by subsequent investigation.

The remaining prototype was used in flight test programs, including fulfilling a December 1943 proposal by Douglas to fit uprated engines and underwing Westinghouse 19XB-2A axial-flow turbojets of 1,600 lbf (7.1 kN) thrust each, making it the XB-42A.

In this configuration, it first flew at Muroc (now Edwards Air Force Base) on 27 May 1947. In testing, it reached 488 mph (785 km/h). After 22 flights, the ventral fin and rudder were damaged in a hard landing in 1947. The XB-42A was repaired but never flew again, and was taken off the USAF inventory on 30 June 1949.

Unit cost was $13.7 million for the program, including the B-43 project.

==Surviving aircraft==
The first prototype 43-50224 is in storage awaiting restoration in the Restoration Hangar at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. The prototype was removed from the USAF inventory in 1949 and given to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. The wings were removed for transport but have since been lost. In 2010 the fuselage was transferred, along with the Douglas XB-43 Jetmaster, to the National Museum of the United States Air Force. Once completed, they will be displayed in the museum&#x27;s Experimental Aircraft Hangar.

<text>The Republic of Genoa ( ; ; ) was a medieval and early modern maritime republic from the years 1099 to 1797 in Liguria on the northwestern Italian coast. During the Late Middle Ages, it was a major commercial power in both the Mediterranean and Black Sea. Between the 16th and 17th centuries, it was one of the major financial centres in Europe.

Throughout its history, the Genoese Republic established numerous colonies throughout the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, including Corsica from 1347 to 1768, Monaco, Southern Crimea from 1266 to 1475, and the islands of Lesbos and Chios from the 14th century to 1462 and 1566, respectively. With the arrival of the early modern period, the Republic had lost many of its colonies, and shifted its focus to banking. This was successful for Genoa, which remained a hub of capitalism, with highly developed banks and trading companies. 

Genoa was known as &quot;la Superba&quot; (&quot;the Superb One&quot;), &quot;la Dominante&quot; (&quot;The Dominant One&quot;), &quot;la Dominante dei mari&quot; (&quot;the Dominant of the Seas&quot;), and &quot;la Repubblica dei magnifici&quot; (&quot;the Republic of the Magnificents&quot;). From the 11th century to 1528, it was officially known as the &quot;Compagna Communis Ianuensis&quot; and from 1580 as the &quot;Serenìscima Repùbrica de Zêna&quot; (Most Serene Republic of Genoa). From 1339 until the state&#x27;s extinction in 1797, the ruler of the republic was the Doge, originally elected for life, after 1528 elected for terms of two years; in practice, the Republic was an oligarchy ruled by a small group of merchant families, from whom the doges were selected.

The Genoese navy played a fundamental role in the wealth and power of the Republic over the centuries and its importance was recognized throughout Europe. To this day, its legacy as a key factor in the triumph of the Genoese Republic is still recognized, and its coat of arms is depicted in the flag of the Italian Navy. In 1284, Genoa fought victoriously against the Republic of Pisa in the Battle of Meloria for dominance over the Tyrrhenian Sea, and it was an eternal rival of Venice for dominance in the Mediterranean as a whole.

The republic began when Genoa became a self-governing commune in the 11th century and ended when it was conquered by the French First Republic under Napoleon and replaced with the Ligurian Republic. The Ligurian Republic was annexed by the First French Empire in 1805; its restoration was briefly proclaimed in 1814 following the defeat of Napoleon, but it was annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1815.

==Name==
From the 11th century to 1528 it was officially known as the &quot;Compagna Communis Ianuensis&quot; and from 1580 as the &quot;Serenìscima Repùbrica de Zêna&quot; (the Most Serene Republic of Genoa) or also &quot;Repubblica di Genova&quot; (, ). It was nicknamed by Petrarch as &quot;La Superba&quot;, in reference to its glory and impressive landmarks. For over eight centuries the republic was also known as &quot;la Dominante&quot; (&#x27;The Dominant one&#x27;), &quot;la Dominante dei mari&quot; (&#x27;the Dominant of the Seas&#x27;), and &quot;la Repubblica dei magnifici&quot; (&#x27;the Republic of the Magnificents&#x27;).

==History==

===Background===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city of Genoa was invaded by Germanic tribes, and, in about 643, Genoa and other Ligurian cities were captured by the Lombard Kingdom under the King Rothari. In 773 the Kingdom was annexed by the Frankish Empire; the first Carolingian count of Genoa was Ademarus, who was given the title &quot;praefectus civitatis Genuensis&quot;. During this time and in the following century Genoa was little more than a small centre, slowly building its merchant fleet, which was to become the leading commercial carrier of the Western Mediterranean. In 934–35 the town was thoroughly sacked and burned by a Fatimid fleet under Ya&#x27;qub ibn Ishaq al-Tamimi. This has led to discussion about whether early tenth-century Genoa was &quot;hardly more than a fishing village&quot; or a vibrant trading town worth attacking.

In the year 958, a diploma granted by Berengar II of Italy gave full legal freedom to the city of Genoa, guaranteeing the possession of its lands in the form of landed lordships. At the end of the 11th century the municipality adopted a constitution, at a meeting consisting of the city&#x27;s trade associations (&quot;compagnie&quot;) and of the lords of the surrounding valleys and coasts. The new city-state was termed a &quot;Compagna Communis.&quot; The local organization remained politically and socially significant for centuries. As late as 1382, the members of the Grand Council were classified by both the &quot;compagnia&quot; to which they belonged as well as by their political faction (&quot;noble&quot; versus &quot;popular&quot;).

===Rise===
Before 1100, Genoa emerged as an independent city-state, one of a number of Italian city-states during this period. Nominally, the Holy Roman Emperor was overlord and the Bishop of Genoa was president of the city; however, actual power was wielded by a number of &quot;consuls&quot; annually elected by popular assembly. At that time Muslim raiders were attacking coastal cities on the Tyrrhenian Sea. Muslims raided Pisa in 1000, and in 1015 they escalated their attacks, raiding Luni. Mujahid al-Siqlabi, Emir of the Taifa of Denia attacked Sardinia with a fleet of 125 ships. In 1016, the allied troops of Genoa and Pisa defended Sardinia. In 1066, war erupted between Genoa and Pisa – possibly over control of Sardinia.

The republic was one of the so-called &quot;Maritime Republics&quot; (&quot;Repubbliche Marinare&quot;), along with Venice, Pisa, Amalfi, Gaeta, Ancona, and Ragusa.

In the Mahdia campaign of 1087, supported by Pope Victor III, Italian forces led by Hugh of Pisa attacked the North African Zirid vassals of the Fatimid Caliphate. Genoese and Pisan fleets, accompanied by troops from Amalfi, Salerno, and Gaeta, captured the Zirid captital, but could not hold it. The Genoese and Pisan burned the fleet in the city&#x27;s harbour and withdrew. The destruction of the Arab fleet gave control of the Western Mediterranean to Genoa, Venice, and Pisa. This enabled Western Europe to supply the troops of the First Crusade of 1096–1099 by sea.

In 1092, Genoa and Pisa, in collaboration with Alfonso VI of León and Castile attacked the Muslim Taifa of Valencia. They also unsuccessfully besieged Tortosa with support from troops of Sancho Ramírez, King of Aragon. 

Genoa started expanding during the First Crusade. In 1097 Hugh of Châteauneuf, Bishop of Grenoble and William, Bishop of Orange, went to Genoa and preached in the church of San Siro in order to gather troops for the First Crusade. Twelve galleys, one ship, and 1,200 soldiers from Genoa joined the crusade. The Genoese troops, led by noblemen de Insula and Avvocato, set sail in July 1097. The Genoese fleet transported and provided naval support to the crusaders, mainly during the siege of Antioch in 1098, when the Genoese fleet blockaded the city while the troops provided support during the siege. In the siege of Jerusalem in 1099, Genoese crossbowmen led by Guglielmo Embriaco acted as support units against the defenders of the city.

After the capture of Antioch on 3 May 1098, Genoa forged an alliance with Bohemond of Taranto, who became the ruler of the Principality of Antioch. As a result, he granted them a headquarters, the church of San Giovanni, and 30 houses in Antioch. On 6 May 1098, a part of the Genoese army returned to Genoa with the relics of Saint John the Baptist, granted to the Republic of Genoa as part of their reward for providing military support to the First Crusade. Many settlements in the Middle East were given to Genoa as well as favourable commercial treaties.

Genoa later allied with King Baldwin I of Jerusalem (reigned 1100–1118). To secure the alliance, Baldwin gave Genoa one-third of the Lordship of Arsuf, one-third of Caesarea, and one-third of Acre and its port&#x27;s income. Additionally the Republic of Genoa would receive 300 bezants every year, and one-third of Baldwin&#x27;s conquest every time 50 or more Genoese soldiers joined his troops.

The Republic&#x27;s role as a maritime power in the region secured many favourable commercial treaties for Genoese merchants. They came to control a large portion of the trade of the Byzantine Empire, Tripoli (Libya), the Principality of Antioch, Cilician Armenia, and Egypt. Although Genoa maintained free-trading rights in Egypt and Syria, it lost some of its territorial possessions after Saladin&#x27;s campaigns in those areas in the late 12th century.

In 1147, Genoa took part in the Siege of Almería, helping Alfonso VII of León and Castile reconquer that city from the Muslims. After the conquest the republic leased out its third of the city to one of its own citizens, Otto de Bonvillano, who swore fealty to the republic and promised to guard the city with three hundred men at all times. This demonstrates how Genoa&#x27;s early efforts at expanding her influence involved enfeoffing private citizens to the commune and controlling overseas territories indirectly, rather than through the republican administration. In 1148, it joined the Siege of Tortosa and helped Count Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona take that city, for which it also received a third.

Over the course of the 11th and particularly the 12th centuries, Genoa became the dominant naval force in the Western Mediterranean, as its erstwhile rivals Pisa and Amalfi declined in importance. Genoa (along with Venice) succeeded in gaining a central position in the Mediterranean slave trade at this time. This left the Republic with only one major rival in the Mediterranean: Venice. The Genoese slave trade and the Venetian slave trade were the main players of the slave trade in the Mediterranean during the Middle Ages. 

Genoese Crusaders brought home a green glass goblet from the Levant, which Genoese long regarded as the Holy Grail. Not all of Genoa&#x27;s merchandise was so innocuous, however, as medieval Genoa became a major player in the slave trade.

===13th and 14th centuries===
The commercial and cultural rivalry between Genoa and Venice played out throughout the thirteenth century. The Republic of Venice played a significant role in the Fourth Crusade, diverting &quot;Latin&quot; energies to the ruin of its former patron and present trading rival, Constantinople. As a result, Venetian support of the newly established Latin Empire meant that Venetian trading rights were enforced, and Venice gained control of a large portion of the commerce of the eastern Mediterranean.

In order to regain control of the commerce, the Republic of Genoa allied with Michael VIII Palaiologos, emperor of Nicaea, who wanted to restore the Byzantine Empire by recapturing Constantinople. In March 1261 the treaty of the alliance was signed in Nymphaeum. On 25 July 1261, Nicaean troops under Alexios Strategopoulos recaptured Constantinople.

As a result, the balance of favour tipped toward Genoa, which was granted free trade rights in the Nicene Empire. Besides the control of commerce in the hands of Genoese merchants, Genoa received ports and way stations in many islands and settlements in the Aegean Sea. The islands of Chios and Lesbos became commercial stations of Genoa as well as the city of Smyrna (İzmir).
Genoa and Pisa became the only states with trading rights in the Black Sea. In the same century the Republic conquered many settlements in Crimea, where the Genoese colony of Caffa was established. The alliance with the restored Byzantine Empire increased the wealth and power of Genoa and simultaneously decreased Venetian and Pisan commerce. The Byzantine Empire had granted the majority of free trading rights to Genoa. In 1282 Pisa tried to gain control of the commerce and administration of Corsica, after being called for support by the judge Sinucello who revolted against Genoa. In August 1282, part of the Genoese fleet blockaded Pisan commerce near the river Arno. During 1283 both Genoa and Pisa made war preparations. Genoa built 120 galleys, 60 of which belonged to the Republic, while the other 60 galleys were rented to individuals. More than 15,000 mercenaries were hired as rowmen and soldiers. The Pisan fleet avoided combat, and tried to wear out the Genoese fleet during 1283. On 5 August 1284, in the naval Battle of Meloria the Genoese fleet, consisting of 93 ships led by Oberto Doria and Benedetto I Zaccaria, defeated the Pisan fleet, which consisted of 72 ships and was led by Albertino Morosini and Ugolino della Gherardesca. Genoa captured 30 Pisan ships and sank seven. About 8,000 Pisans were killed during the battle, more than half of the Pisan troops, which were about 14,000. The defeat of Pisa, which never fully recovered as a maritime competitor, resulted in gain of control of the commerce of Corsica by Genoa. The Sardinian town of Sassari, which was under Pisan control, became a commune or self-styled &quot;free municipality&quot; which was controlled by Genoa. Control of Sardinia, however, did not pass permanently to Genoa: the Aragonese kings of Naples disputed control and did not secure it until the fifteenth century.
Genoese merchants pressed south, to the island of Sicily, and into Muslim North Africas, where Genoese established trading posts, pursuing the gold that travelled up through the Sahara and establishing Atlantic depots as far afield as Salé and Safi. In 1283 the population of the Kingdom of Sicily revolted against the Angevin rule. The revolt became known as the Sicilian Vespers. As a result, the Aragonese rule was established in the Kingdom. Genoa, which had supported the Aragonese, was granted free trading and export rights in the Kingdom of Sicily. Genoese bankers also profited from loans to the new nobility of Sicily. Corsica was formally annexed in 1347.

Genoa was far more than a depot of drugs and spices from the East: an essential engine of its economy was the weaving of silk textiles, from imported thread, following the symmetrical styles of Byzantine and Sassanian silks.

As a result of the economic retrenchment in Europe in the late fourteenth century, as well as its long war with Venice, which culminated in its defeat at Chioggia (1380), Genoa went into decline. This pivotal war with Venice has come to be called the War of Chioggia because of this decisive battle which resulted in the defeat of Genoa at the hands of Venice. Prior to the War of Chioggia, which lasted from 1379 until 1381, the Genoese had enjoyed a naval ascendency that was the source of their power and position within northern Italy. The Genoan defeat deprived Genoa of this naval supremacy, pushed it out of eastern Mediterranean markets and began the decline of the city-state. Rising Ottoman power also cut into the Genoese emporia in the Aegean, and the Black Sea trade was reduced.

In 1396, in order to protect the republic from internal unrest and the provocations of the Duke of Orléans and the former Duke of Milan, the Doge of Genoa Antoniotto Adorno made Charles VI of France the &quot;difensor del comune&quot; (&quot;defender of the municipality&quot;) of Genoa. Though the republic had previously been under partial foreign control, this marked the first time Genoa was dominated by a foreign power.

===Golden age of Genoese bankers===
Though not well-studied, Genoa in the 15th century seems to have been tumultuous. The city had a strong tradition of trading goods from the Levant and its financial expertise was recognised all over Europe. After a brief period of French domination from 1394 to 1409, Genoa came under the rule of the Visconti of Milan. Genoa lost Sardinia to Aragon, Corsica to internal revolt, and its colonies in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Asia Minor to the Ottoman Empire.

In the 15th century, two of the earliest banks in the world were founded in Genoa: the Bank of Saint George, founded in 1407, which was the oldest state deposit bank in the world at its closure in 1805, and the mount of piety of Genoa was founded in 1483 and it still exists.
Threatened by Alfonso V of Aragon, the Doge of Genoa in 1458 handed the Republic over to the French, making it the Duchy of Genoa under the control of John of Anjou, a French royal governor. However, with support from Milan, Genoa revolted and the Republic was restored in 1461. The Milanese then changed sides, conquering Genoa in 1464 and holding it as a fief of the French crown. Between 1463–78 and 1488–99, Genoa was held by the Milanese House of Sforza. From 1499 to 1528, the Republic reached its nadir, being under nearly continual French occupation. The Spanish, with their intramural allies, the &quot;old nobility&quot; entrenched in the mountain fastnesses behind Genoa, captured the city on May 30, 1522, and subjected the city to a pillage. When the admiral Andrea Doria of the powerful Doria family allied with the Emperor Charles V to oust the French and restore Genoa&#x27;s independence, a renewed prospect opened: 1528 marks the first loan from Genoese banks to Charles.

Under the ensuing economic recovery, many aristocratic Genoese families, such as the Balbi, Doria, Grimaldi, Pallavicini, and Serra, amassed tremendous fortunes. According to Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and others, the practices Genoa developed in the Mediterranean (such as chattel slavery) were crucial in the exploration and exploitation of the New World.

At the time of Genoa&#x27;s peak in the 16th century, the city attracted many artists, including Rubens, Caravaggio, and van Dyck. The architect Galeazzo Alessi (1512–1572) designed many of the city&#x27;s splendid palazzi. In the next 50 years, other palazzi were designed by Bartolomeo Bianco (1590–1657), designer of centrepieces of the University of Genoa. A number of Genoese Baroque and Rococo artists settled elsewhere and a number of local artists became prominent.
Thereafter, Genoa underwent something of a revival as a junior associate of the Spanish Empire, with Genoese bankers, in particular, financing many of the Spanish crown&#x27;s foreign endeavors from their counting houses in Seville. Fernand Braudel has even called the period 1557 to 1627 the &quot;age of the Genoese&quot;, &quot;of a rule that was so discreet and sophisticated that historians for a long time failed to notice it&quot;. However, the modern visitor passing brilliant Mannerist and Baroque palazzo facades along Genoa&#x27;s &quot;Strada Nova&quot; (now Via Garibaldi) or &quot;via Balbi&quot; cannot fail to notice that there was conspicuous wealth, which in fact was not Genoese but concentrated in the hands of a tightly knit circle of banker-financiers, true &quot;venture capitalists&quot;. Genoa&#x27;s trade, however, remained closely dependent on control of Mediterranean sealanes, and the loss of Chios to the Ottoman Empire (1566), struck a severe blow.

The opening for the Genoese banking consortium was the state bankruptcy of Philip II in 1557, which threw the German banking houses into chaos and ended the reign of the Fuggers as Spanish financiers. The Genoese bankers provided the unwieldy Habsburg system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further ventures.

From about 1520 the Genoese controlled the Spanish port of Panama, the first port on the Pacific, founded by the conquest of the Americas. The Genoese obtained a concession to exploit the port mainly for the slave trade of the new world on the Pacific, which lasted until the sacking and destruction of the original city in 1671.

In 1635, Don Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera, who had been governor of Panama, recruited Genoese, Peruvian, and Panamanian soldiers to fight in the Philippines, where he had been appointed governor, against the Muslim Sultanates of Sulu and Maguindanao. In this situation Genoese bankers were thus active in Spain&#x27;s Mediterranean and New World possessions (Peru, Mexico, and Philippines).

The Genoese banker Ambrogio Spinola, Marquess of Los Balbases, for instance, raised and led an army that fought in the Eighty Years&#x27; War in the Netherlands in the early 17th century. The decline of Spain in the 17th century brought also the renewed decline of Genoa, and the Spanish crown&#x27;s frequent bankruptcies, in particular, ruined many of Genoa&#x27;s merchant houses. In 1684 the city was heavily bombarded by a French fleet as punishment for its alliance with Spain.

===Decline===
In May 1625, a French-Savoian army briefly laid siege to Genoa. Though it was eventually lifted with the aid of the Spanish, the French would later bombard the city in May 1684 for its support of Spain during the War of the Reunions. In-between, a plague killed as many as half of the inhabitants of Genoa in 1656–57. Genoa continued its slow decline well into the 18th century, losing its last Mediterranean colony, the island fortress of Tabarka, to the Bey of Tunis in 1742.

In a climate of constant economic and power decline, in 1729 the Republic had to face another revolt in Corsica. It is considered the first moment of real rupture between the island and the Genoese Republic: perhaps the most important, because the representatives of the Church in full harmony with the Roman Curia, &quot;justified&quot; the war. This time the Genoese government requested the help of Charles VI, who sent 10,000 German infantry of the Imperial Army, after the payment by Genoa of 60,000 florins and 100 scudi for each dead soldier, joining the Republic&#x27;s soldiers commanded by Camillo Doria. Genoa managed to contain the rebellion, however this did not prove lasting. Another revolt broke out in 1733, causing the Genoese to again appeal to the Emperor, but the Imperial Army was tied up against the French in the ongoing War of the Polish Succession, and thus declined to intervene. Even before the rebellions, Genoa&#x27;s control of the island had been loose; the Republic had effectively demilitarized itself, with only 2,000 soldiers (all spread throughout fortifications in Liguria) for a mainland population of about half a million, and law and order on Corsica were very weak, with nearly 900 homicides per 100,000 people there annually from 1701 to 1733. The Genoese government tried to ban private firearm ownership on Corsica without success. A guerilla war would continue on the island until it was sold to France in 1768.
The Convention of Turin of 1742, in which Austria allied with the Kingdom of Sardinia, caused some consternation in the Republic. However, when this provisional relationship was given a more durable and reliable character in the signing of the Treaty of Worms, in 1743, the fear of diplomatic isolation had caused the Genoese Republic to abandon its neutrality and to ally with the House of Bourbon in the War of the Austrian Succession. Consequently, the Republic of Genoa signed a secret treaty with the Bourbon allies of Kingdom of France, Spanish Empire and Kingdom of Naples. On 26 June 1745, the Republic of Genoa declared war on the Kingdom of Sardinia. This decision would prove disastrous for Genoa, which later surrendered to the Austrians in September 1746 and was briefly occupied before a revolt liberated the city two months later. The Austrians returned in 1747 and, along with a contingent of Sardinian forces, laid siege to Genoa before being driven off by the approach of a Franco-Spanish army.

Though Genoa retained its lands in the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, it was unable to keep its hold on Corsica in its weakened state. After driving out the Genoese, the Corsican Republic was declared in 1755. Eventually relying on French intervention to quash the rebellion, Genoa was forced to cede Corsica to the French in the 1768 Treaty of Versailles.

===The end of the Republic and its brief revival of 1814===
In 1794 and 1795 the revolutionary echoes from France reached Genoa, thanks to Genoese exile propagandists sheltered nearby in southeastern France, and a conspiracy against the aristocratic and oligarchic ruling class developed. In 1796, the French army under Napoleon defeated Austria and Piedmont, gaining control of the region. In May 1797, Genoese Jacobins, aided by French volunteers, moved to overthrow Doge Giacomo Maria Brignole, giving rise to a fratricidal war in the streets between opponents and supporters of the government.

Napoleon&#x27;s representatives then intervened. In early June, the old elites who had ruled Genoa for all of its history were overthrown. On June 14, 1797, the Ligurian Republic was proclaimed, under the watchful care of Republican France. After Bonaparte&#x27;s seizure of power in France, a more conservative constitution was enacted, but the Ligurian Republic&#x27;s life was short: in 1805 it was annexed by France, becoming the &quot;départements&quot; of Apennins, Gênes, and Montenotte.

With the fall of Napoleon, Genoa regained an ephemeral independence, as the &quot;Repubblica genovese&quot;, which lasted less than a year. However, the subsequent Congress of Vienna decreed the annexation of all Genoese territories (all of Liguria, the Oltregiogo area, and the island of Capraia) by the Kingdom of Sardinia, ruled by the House of Savoy, even though contravening the principle of restoring legitimate governments and monarchies.

==Government==

The history of Genoa, of the Genoese and of the republic that held its fate for a long time, but also of the governments that gradually took turns leading the city, to reach the time of the Doges, is traceable through the work of historians who have continued the storytelling work begun at the end of the 11th century by Caffaro Di Caschifellone (historian and himself municipal consul) with the &quot;Annales ianuenses&quot;.

The Republic of Genoa&#x27;s governance history is divided into five stages:

* Consul: 11th century–1191
* Podestà: 1191–1256
* Capitano del popolo: 1257–1339
* Doge (elected for life): 1339–1528
* Doge (elected for terms of two years): 1528–1797

The republic was substantially democratic in shape, while those of the Podestàs and the Captains of the people strongly restored the often conflicting relationship between the authority and the freedom. The perpetual doges, on the other hand, proclaimed themselves popular, even though sometimes crossing the oligarchy; finally the fifth republic was institutionally aristocratic. By custom, prelates in Genoa were unable to take on public office.

==Aristocratic families==
In the first two centuries from the institution of the Dogate for life in Genoa, it was above all the Adorno (seven doges elected) and Fregoso (ten doges elected) families who fought the position.

After the reform of 1528, among the seventy-nine &quot;biennial Doges&quot; who came to power, many were elected from a small number of noble houses in the city organized into 28 &quot;Alberghi&quot;, in particular:

* Grimaldi: eleven doges.
* Spinola: eleven doges.
* Durazzo: eight doges.
* De Franchi, Giustiniani and Lomellini families: seven doges each.
* Centurione: six doges.
* Doria: six doges.
* Cattaneo: five doges.
* Gentile: five doges.
* Brignole: four doges.
* Imperiali: four doges.
* De Mari, Invrea and Negrone families: four doges each.
* Pallavicini: three doges.
* Sauli: three doges.
* Balbi, Cambiaso, Chiavari, Lercari, Pinelli, Promontorio, Veneroso, Viale and Zoagli families: two doges each.
* Della Torre: two doges.
* Assereto, Ayroli, Canevaro, Chiavica Cibo, Clavarezza, Da Passano, De Ferrari, De Fornari, De Marini, Di Negro, Ferreti, Franzoni, Frugoni, Garbarino, Giudice Calvi, Odone, Saluzzo, Senarega, Vacca and Vivaldi: one doge each
* Della Rovere: one doge.

Other influential families of the Republic of Genoa were:

* Fieschi: counts of Lavagna, and produced two Popes: Pope Innocent IV and Pope Adrian V
* Gattilusi: lords of numerous lands in the Aegean Sea, such as Lemnos, Lesbos, Enez and Samothrace.
* Embriaco: Lords of Gibelet for almost 200 years, and important players in the history of the Crusader states.
* Zaccaria: rulers of several polities in Latin-ruled Greece, including the Lordship of Chios and lastly, the Principality of Achaea, and produced one admiral, Benedetto I Zaccaria. 

== Genoese possessions ==

At the time of its founding in the early 11th century the Republic of Genoa consisted of the city of Genoa and the surrounding areas. As the commerce of the city increased, so did the territory of the Republic. By the end of the 12th century all of Liguria fell under the Republic of Genoa. After the First Crusade in 1098 Genoa gained settlements in Syria. (It lost the majority of them during the campaigns of Saladin in the 12th century.) In 1261 the city of Smyrna in Asia Minor became Genoese territory.

In 1255, Genoa established the colony of Caffa in Crimea. In the following years the Genoese established further colonies in Crimea: Soldaia, Cherco and Cembalo. Genoa and its colonies fought against several Mongol states in the Genoese–Mongol Wars to control the Crimean peninsula. In 1275 the Byzantine Empire granted the islands of Chios and Samos to Genoa. 

Between 1316 and 1332, Genoa established the Black Sea colonies of La Tana (present-day Azov) and Samsun in Anatolia. In 1355, the Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos granted Lesbos to a Genoese lord. At the end of the 14th century the colony of Samastri was established in the Black Sea and Cyprus was granted to the Republic. At that period the Republic of Genoa also controlled one quarter of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire, and Trebizond, capital of the Empire of Trebizond. The Ottoman Empire conquered most of the Genoese overseas territories during the 15th century.

===Other territories outside mainland Italy===

* Giudicato of Logudoro (island of Sardinia) 1259–1325
* North Aegean Sea possessions, centered at Chios 1261–1566
* Southern Crimea possessions of Gazaria 1266–1475 (lost to Ottoman Empire, Kefe Eyalet)
* Island of Corsica 1284–1768
* The cities of Gibelet (1100–late 13th century) and Tyre (present-day Lebanon)
* City of Tabarka north west of Tunisia 1540–1742
* The cities of Calafat, Giurgiu, Licostomo, Vicina and Galați, all cities in present-day Romania (from the 13th century to the 15th century)
* Part of the County of Nice ceded to France after the Treaty of Turin in 1860.
* Monaco was sold to the Grimaldi family in the 15th century

==Economy==
Genoese traders bought salt – from Hyères near Toulon in French Provence, from Cagliari in Sardinia, Tortosa in Iberia, and from other areas in the Black Sea, North Africa, Cyprus, Crete, and Ibiza – and made salami. They then sold salami in southern Italy for raw silk, which was sold in Lucca for fabrics, which were then sold to Lyon. Mule caravans from Genoa carried salt directly to Piacenza, where it was transferred to river barges and transported down the Po to Parma, and other Po Valley cities such as Reggio and Bologna. Along these trade routes, Genoa competed with Venice for salt and for other cargoes, such as salami, prosciutto, cheese, textiles and spices.

==Notable people==

* Christopher Columbus, late 15th century Italian explorer sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain who was the first person to find a route to the Caribbean and South America 

* Giovanni Giustiniani, nobleman, mercenary captain, and defender of Constantinople during its siege in 1453.
* Ingo della Volta, late 11th century or early 12th century Genoese politician

<doc id="559964" wikidata="Q7055506" url="?curid=559964" title="North Greenwich, Isle of Dogs">
<text>North Greenwich is a formal 19th century name for an area now in Millwall situated at the very southern tip of the Isle of Dogs, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It lies to the south of the commercial estates of West India Docks including Canary Wharf and has a short shoreline along London&#x27;s Tideway part of the River Thames.

It should not be confused with the Greenwich Peninsula formerly known as &quot;East Greenwich&quot; that lies south of the river and is the site of The O2 (formerly the Millennium Dome). The opening in 1999 of the North Greenwich tube station on London Underground&#x27;s Jubilee line has now led to this area being unofficially known colloquially as &quot;North Greenwich&quot;.

==History==
The area takes it name after Greenwich but was never a part of it, and was created for the now defunct North Greenwich railway station (1872), that served a former passenger ferry to Greenwich which the name became used to refer to the modern area. The station stood near the later Island Gardens (1897) and Greenwich foot tunnel (1902).

It faces Greenwich town centre over the River Thames and the area is now more usually known as South Millwall. Millwall Football Club played in this area from 1901 to 1910, naming their ground North Greenwich.

==Amenities==

The historical Island Gardens, opened on 3 August 1895 by local politician Will Crooks, is located almost in front of the former Greenwich Hospital, the Cutty Sark, National Maritime Museum and Greenwich Park.

===Landmarks===
The Ferry House is a pub on Ferry Street has existed since the Tudor period (1485-1603). The present building dates from 1822, and was used as a drinking establishment by ferry passengers to and from Greenwich until the opening of the Greenwich foot tunnel in 1902.

==Education==

* George Green&#x27;s School (actually in Cubitt Town but on the western and southern boundary with North Greenwich)

==Transport==

North Greenwich shares a Docklands Light Railway station with Cubitt Town called Island Gardens on the Bank-Lewisham line.

Several London Buses routes call in the area, 135 and D7, N550 run on Manchester Road and 277 on East Ferry Road.

The Greenwich foot tunnel crosses beneath the River Thames, opened on the 4 August 1902 and it original purpose was to allow south London residents to work on the Isle of Dogs without having to make a large detour. It connects North Greenwich to Greenwich town centre.

==Sport==
Blackwall and District Rowing Club was formed in 1845 and is one of the oldest rowing clubs in the United Kingdom. A Tideway rowing club, historically it known as the Poplar, Blackwall and District Rowing Club. It competes in leading national races, runs Poplar regatta (wind permitting), and is the end of the Great River Race. Its members hold old records in the Doggett&#x27;s Coat and Badge race for single sculls on the Thames. Its most notable member is Olympic gold and silver medallist, and double-World Champion Mark Hunter.

North Greenwich football ground in East Ferry Road was home to Millwall Athletic Football Club, today Millwall F.C., from 1901 to 1910.

<text>Testeagles, sometimes referred to as &quot;TEs&quot; or &quot;Testes&quot;, are a three-piece rock band which formed in Adelaide, South Australia in 1994. The group is made up of brothers Matthew &quot;Matty&quot; Matt (lead guitar and lead vocals) and Adrian &quot;Ady&quot; Matt (drums), alongside Dave &quot;D&quot; Paisawa (bass guitar and vocals). D joined the lineup in 1999, replacing their original bass guitarist, Dean.

The group have a handful of official releases to their name, the first being the &quot;Chum&quot; EP released in 1995, which was followed by the &quot;B-Sting&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; EPs in 1998, their first tracks to secure them Triple J airplay. In 1999, the group released singles &quot;Turn That Shit Up&quot; and &quot;Underdog&quot; from their debut album, &quot;Non Comprehendus&quot;.

&quot;Non Comprehendus&quot; was released in February 2000 and peaked at No.8 on the ARIA Albums Chart. This album, along with its singles, were also played on Triple J and gained them a much larger national following. A third single from the album, &quot;Like No Other&quot;, was released in 2000.

== History ==

Testeagles were formed as a techno rock trio in Adelaide in 1994 by Matthew &quot;Matty&quot; Matt on lead guitar and lead vocals; his brother, Adrian &quot;Ady&quot; Matt on drums; and Dean &quot;Deano&quot; Lawn on bass guitar.

Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane felt they &quot;displayed an uncanny ability to combine thudding metal/indie rock with electronic beats and samples to arrive at an intense brand of techno rock.&quot;

Their first extended play, &quot;Chum&quot;, was released in December 1995, with seven tracks, on the independent label DEF Records. They were signed by Stuart MacQueen of Adelaide-based independent label, Krell Records. During 1998 they issued two EPs, &quot;B-Sting&quot; (March) and &quot;Friends&quot; (August), on Krell.

In late 1998, Deano was replaced by D Paisawa. The band were signed by Epic/Sony and issued &quot;Turn That Shit Up&quot; as their first single in July 1999. In January 2000 &quot;Turn That Shit Up&quot; was listed at No.66 on Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 for 1999. The single was followed by &quot;Underdog&quot; (October 1999) and &quot;Like No Other&quot;.

Their debut album, &quot;Non Comprehendus&quot;, appeared in February 2000, which peaked at No.8 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It was produced by Paul McKercher (You Am I, Spiderbait).

McFarlane described it as &quot;A heavy-duty mix of alterna-metal riff-rock, squalling sound effects, experimental electronic beats and samples, [it] was certainly the most visceral album to chart in the Australian Top 10 since the likes of Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson.&quot; Christie Eliezer of &quot;Billboard&quot; felt the album was similar to material by United States groups, KoЯn and Limp Bizkit.

Due to label difficulties, the Testeagles left Sony and the independent label Krell.

The group were regulars at the annual Big Day Out festivals, and last appeared at the Adelaide venue in 2005.

Testeagles&#x27; final performance, before disbanding, was at the Hi-Fi Bar in Melbourne supporting Mammal on 21 June 2008.

<doc id="559970" wikidata="Q3082251" url="?curid=559970" title="Jetty">
<text>A jetty is a man-made structure that protrudes from land out into water. A jetty may serve as a breakwater, as a walkway, or both; or, in pairs, as a means of constricting a channel. The term derives from the French word &quot;&quot;, &quot;thrown&quot;, signifying something thrown out.

==For regulating rivers==
===Wing dams===
One form of jetties, wing dams, are extended out, opposite one another, from each bank of a river, at intervals, to contract a wide channel, and concentrate the current to deepen the channel.

===At the outlet of tideless rivers===
Jetties have been constructed on each side of the outlet river of some of the rivers flowing into the Baltic, with the objective of prolonging the scour of the river and protecting the channel from being shoaled by the littoral drift along the shore. Another application of parallel jetties is in lowering the bar in front of one of the mouths of a deltaic river flowing into a tide — a virtual prolongation of its less sea, by extending the scour of the river out to the bar by banks.

Jetties prolonging the Sulina branch of the Danube into the Black Sea, and the south pass of the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, formed of rubble stone and concrete blocks, and respectively, have enabled the discharge of these rivers to scour away the bars obstructing the access to them; and they have also carried the sediment-bearing waters sufficiently far out to come under the influence of littoral currents, which, by conveying away some of the sediment, postpone the eventual formation of a fresh bar farther out (see river engineering).

===At the mouth of tidal rivers===
Where a river is narrow near its mouth, has a generally feeble discharge and a small tidal range, the sea is liable on an exposed coast to block up its outlet during severe storms. The river is thus forced to seek another exit at a weak spot of the beach, which along a low coast may be at some distance off; and this new outlet in its turn may be blocked up, so that the river from time to time shifts the position of its mouth. This inconvenient cycle of changes may be stopped by fixing the outlet of the river at a suitable site, by carrying a jetty on each side of this outlet across the beach, thereby concentrating its discharge in a definite channel and protecting the mouth from being blocked up by littoral drift. This system was long ago applied to the shifting outlet of the river Yare to the south of Yarmouth, and has also been successfully employed for fixing the wandering mouth of the Adur near Shoreham, and of the Adour flowing into the Bay of Biscay below Bayonne.

When a new channel was cut across the Hook of Holland to provide a straighter and deeper outlet channel for the river Meuse, forming the approach channel to Rotterdam, low, broad, parallel jetties, composed of fascine mattresses weighted with stone, were carried across the foreshore into the sea on either side of the new mouth of the river, to protect the jetty channel from littoral drift, and cause the discharge of the river to maintain it out to deep water. The channel, also, beyond the outlet of the river Nervion into the Bay of Biscay has been regulated by jetties; and by extending the south-west jetty out for nearly with a curve concave towards the channel the outlet has not only been protected to some extent from the easterly drift, but the bar in front has been lowered by the scour produced by the discharge of the river following the concave bend of the southwest jetty. As the outer portion of this jetty was exposed to westerly storms from the Bay of Biscay before the outer harbour was constructed, it has been given the form and strength of a breakwater situated in shallow water.

==For berthing at docks==
Where docks are given sloping sides, openwork timber jetties are generally carried across the slope, at the ends of which vessels can lie in deep water or more solid structures are erected over the slope for supporting coal-tips. Pilework jetties are also constructed in the water outside the entrances to docks on each side, so as to form an enlarging trumpet-shaped channel between the entrance, lock or tidal basin and the approach channel, in order to guide vessels in entering or leaving the docks. Solid jetties, moreover, lined with quay walls, are sometimes carried out into a wide dock, at right angles to the line of quays at the side, to enlarge the accommodation; and they also serve, when extended on a large scale from the coast of a tideless sea under shelter of an outlying breakwater, to form the basins in which vessels lie when discharging and taking in cargoes in such a port as Marseille.

==At entrances to jetty harbors==

The approach channel to some ports situated on sandy coasts is guided and protected across the beach by parallel jetties. In some cases, these are made solid up to a little above low water of neap tides, on which open timber-work is erected, provided with a planked platform at the top raised above the highest tides. In other cases, they consist entirely of solid material without timber-work. The channel between the jetties was originally maintained by tidal scour from low-lying areas close to the coast, and subsequently by the current from sluicing basins; but it is now often considerably deepened by sand-pump dredging. It is protected to some extent by the solid portion of the jetties from the inroad of sand from the adjacent beach, and from the levelling action of the waves; while the upper open portion serves to indicate the channel and to guide the vessels, if necessary (see harbor).

The bottom part of the older jetties, in such long-established jetty ports as Calais, Dunkirk and Ostend, was composed of clay or rubble stone, covered on the top by fascine-work or pitching, but the deepening of the jetty channel by dredging and the need that arose for its enlargement led to the reconstruction of the jetties at these ports. The new jetties at Dunkirk were founded in the sandy beach, by the aid of compressed air, at a depth of below low water of spring tides; and their solid masonry portion, on a concrete foundation was raised . above low water of neap tides.

==At lagoon outlets==
A small tidal rise spreading tidal water over a large expanse of lagoon or inland backwater causes the influx and efflux of the tide to maintain a deep channel through a narrows no longer confined by a bank on each side, becomes dispersed, and owing to the reduction of its scouring force, is no longer able at a moderate distance from the shore effectually to resist the action of tending to form a continuous beach in front of the outlet. Hence a bar is produced that diminishes the available depth in the approach channel. By carrying out a solid jetty over the bar, however on each side of the outlet, the tidal currents are concentrated in the channel across the bar, and lower it by scour. Thus the available depth of the approach channels to Venice through the Malamocco and Lido outlets from the Venetian Lagoon have been deepened several feet (metres) over their bars by jetties of rubble, carried out across the foreshore into deep water on both sides of the channel.

Other examples are provided by the long jetties extended into the sea in front of the entrance to Charleston harbour, formerly constructed of fascines weighed down with stone and logs, but subsequently of rubble stone, and by the two converging rubble jetties carried out from each shore of Dublin Bay for deepening the approach to Dublin harbour.

Jetties have the adverse effect of endangering Surf Culture as a whole with their ability to destroy surf breaks.

<text>Dave Broadfoot (December 5, 1925 – November 1, 2016) was a Canadian comedian and satirist. He is best known for his performances as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Farce.

==Early life==
Broadfoot was born in North Vancouver, British Columbia, to a religious family. He left high school in 1943 and joined the merchant navy, serving until 1947.

==Career==
In the late 1940s, Broadfoot returned home and participated in community theatre in Vancouver, eventually gravitating towards comedy.

He moved to Toronto in 1952 and for ten years was a writer and performer in the stage revues &quot;Spring Thaw&quot; and &quot;The Big Review&quot;. In 1962, &quot;Spring Thaw&quot; had a run at the Hammersmith Theatre in London, England under the name &quot;Clap Hands&quot;, with a cast that included Broadfoot, Corinne Conley, Jack Creley and Eric Christmas.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Broadfoot appeared on several CBC television shows, including &quot;The Big Revue&quot;, the &quot;Wayne and Shuster Show&quot;, and &quot;Comedy Café&quot;, on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in the U.S. in 1955, and on radio with &quot;Funny You Should Say That&quot;. He also had occasional film roles in the early 1970s, including in the films &quot;Hold on to Daddy&#x27;s Ears (Tiens-toi bien après les oreilles à papa)&quot;, &quot;The Rebels (Quelques arpents de neige)&quot;, &quot;Enuff Is Enuff (J&#x27;ai mon voyage!)&quot; and &quot;The Sloane Affair&quot;.

From 1973 to 1993 he was a member of the radio version of the &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot;. He retired from regular performing when the troupe moved to television, although he continued to appear on the show as an occasional guest star, including the TV series finale in 2008.

In addition to stand-up routines in the traditional format, Broadfoot created a number of recurring characters including, most notably:

*Big Bobby Clobber, a professional hockey player who seemed to have taken a few too many hits or else was not very sharp to begin with.
*David J. Broadfoot, the Honourable Member of Parliament for Kicking Horse Pass, representing the New Apathetic Party. (Kicking Horse Pass is a mountain pass in the Canadian Rockies with a negligible population.)
*Sgt. Renfrew of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Broadfoot performed this character for the RCMP on a number of occasions, receiving &#x27;promotions&#x27; over the years. He was an honorary Sergeant-Major. Broadfoot also wrote the scripts for a comic strip adaptation based on this character, which was drawn by Olga Urbansky in the late 1970s.

After leaving Air Farce, Broadfoot toured comedy clubs and appeared at the &quot;Just for Laughs&quot; festival. He starred in the 1998 comedy special, &quot;Old Enough To Say What I Want&quot;, and two years later in &quot;Old Dog, New Tricks&quot;, winning Gemini Awards for both.

Broadfoot also starred in the short-run sitcom &quot;XPM&quot;. He received several ACTRA and Juno awards and was an Officer of the Order of Canada. In 2003, Broadfoot received a Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement for his work in broadcasting. He wrote an autobiography, also entitled &quot;Old Enough to Say What I Want&quot; (). He retired in 2005. Beginning in 2006, the Canadian Comedy Awards gave the Dave Broadfoot Award for Special Achievement.

He also did voices for two animated Christmas specials, &quot;George and the Christmas Star&quot; and &quot;Bluetoes the Christmas Elf&quot;, and made a guest appearance as a hospital patient in the hit TV series, &quot;Puppets Who Kill&quot;. Broadfoot died on November 1, 2016, at the age of 90.

<text>Henry Somerset, 2nd Duke of Beaufort, KG PC (2 April 1684 – 24 May 1714) was an English peer and politician. He was the only son of Charles Somerset, Marquess of Worcester, and Rebecca Child. He was styled Earl of Glamorgan until 1698, and Marquess of Worcester from 1698 until his grandfather&#x27;s death on 21 January 1700, when he succeeded him as 2nd Duke of Beaufort.

==Life==
Born at Monmouth Castle, he entertained Queen Anne and the Prince Consort with splendour at Badminton in August 1702. He held aloof from public affairs until the fall of Sunderland heralded the collapse of the &quot;Whig Junto&quot; in 1710, when he is said to have remarked to the queen that he could at length call her a queen in reality. A thorough-going Tory, he was, after some opposition from Jonathan Swift, admitted a member of the &quot;Brothers’ Club&quot; on 21 February 1711. He was made captain of the gentlemen pensioners in 1712, and appointed a Knight of the Garter in October 1712.

Dying at the age of thirty, on 24 May 1714, Beaufort was succeeded by his son Henry. The 2nd Duke is buried at St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton.

==Family==
He married three times: 
* On 7 July 1702 to Lady Mary Sackville, daughter of Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset, who died 18 June 1705, with whom he had no issue;
* On 26 February 1706 to Lady Rachel Noel, daughter of Wriothesley Baptist Noel, 2nd Earl of Gainsborough, who died 13 September 1709 after giving birth, and
* On 14 September 1711 at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Wimbledon to Lady Mary Osborne (d. 4 February 1722), daughter of Peregrine Osborne, 2nd Duke of Leeds, with whom he had no issue.

With his second wife he had two sons:
# Henry Somerset, 3rd Duke of Beaufort his heir and successor; and
# Charles Noel Somerset, 4th Duke of Beaufort his brother&#x27;s heir and successor.

<doc id="559991" wikidata="Q1070973" url="?curid=559991" title="Jean Cabannes">
<text>Jean Cabannes (; 12 August 1885 – 31 October 1959) was a French physicist specialising in optics.

== Education and career ==
Cabannes studied at the Lycée de Nice and entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1906. From 1910 to 1914, Cabannes worked in the laboratory of Charles Fabry at Aix-Marseille University on the topic launched by Lord Rayleigh at the end of the 19th century of how gas molecules diffused light. In 1914 he showed that pure gases could scatter light. This was published in Comptes Rendus in 1915. (Please see reference.) His career was then interrupted for five years by World War I.

In 1919 Cabannes returned to Fabry&#x27;s laboratory to complete his thesis, after which he moved to University of Montpellier, and later on to University of Paris. In 1925 he and Jean Dufay calculated the height of the ozone layer. Cabannes along with Pierre Daure and Yves Rocard were among the scientists who, in 1928, discovered that gases diffusing monochromatic light could also change their wavelength (the Cabannes-Daure effect).

This was identified independently by C. V. Raman and K. S. Krishnan in liquids, and by G. S. Landsberg and L. I. Mandelstam in crystals. Cabannes was among the candidates for the Nobel Prize in Physics of 1929 (proposed by Charles Fabry), which was awarded to de Broglie and the 1930 prize went to C. V. Raman.

== Honors and awards ==

In 1949 he was elected a member of l&#x27;Académie des Sciences. In 1924 he received the Prix Félix-Robin and in 1951 the first ever awarded Prix des Trois Physiciens from the Fondation de France.

Cabannes was the President of the Société astronomique de France (SAF) (French astronomical society), from 1951-1953.

The lunar crater Cabannes was named after him.

== Personal life ==
He was married to a daughter of Eugène Fabry (1856–1944), brother of Charles Fabry, and was the father of four children, among whom was the mathematician Henri Cabannes.

<text>Marguerite Jeanne &quot;Meg&quot; Japy Steinheil, Baroness Abinger (16 April 1869 – 17 July 1954) was a French woman known for her many love affairs with important men. She was present at the death of President Félix Faure, who was rumoured to have died after having a seizure while allegedly having sex with her. She was later tried for the murders of her husband and mother, but was acquitted.

==Early life==
Steinheil was born Marguerite Jeanne Japy in Beaucourt, in the Territoire de Belfort, to a rich, industrial family, the daughter of Émilie (Rau) and Édouard Japy. She married the French painter , son of painter Louis Charles Auguste Steinheil, in July 1890. She became a prominent figure in Parisian society, and her salon was frequented by men of eminence in French political and social circles, including Charles Gounod, Ferdinand de Lesseps, René Lalique, Jules Massenet, François Coppée, Émile Zola, and Pierre Loti.

==Mistress of President Félix Faure==
In 1897, Steinheil was introduced, at Chamonix, to President Félix Faure, who was giving an official contract to Adolphe Steinheil. Because of this, Faure came often to their home on the .

Shortly afterward, Steinheil became Faure&#x27;s mistress and was regularly ushered into the in the private quarters of the presidential Élysée Palace.

On 16 February 1899, Félix Faure called Steinheil by telephone, asking her to come to the palace at the end of the afternoon. Shortly after her arrival, servants were rung for, and they found the president lying on the couch while Steinheil adjusted her disordered clothing. Faure died several hours later.

Unverified legend has it that Steinheil was performing oral sex on him when he suffered a fatal stroke, his convulsed hands tangled in her hair. This was not officially announced, but rumours started spreading immediately, although for several years it was believed that his partner at the time of his death was actress Cécile Sorel.
The archetypal &quot;demimondaine&quot;, after the death of Félix Faure, Steinheil became the mistress of many other famous men.

In her , Steinheil records how she and her spouse received a mysterious German guest, who bought back from them each of the pearls of a collar given to her by Faure (, as it became known in the press) and who reclaimed a manuscript of the president&#x27;s memoirs which he had entrusted to Marguerite.

In February 1908, she met the powerful industrialist Maurice Borderel, also from the Ardennes, and soon became his lover.
On 31 May 1908, Marguerite&#x27;s mother and husband were found dead in their residence in the , off the . Both had died of suffocation by strangulation. Marguerite was found gagged and bound to a bed. She initially said that she had been tied up by four black-robed strangers, three men and a woman. Some newspapers speculated that they had come to her house in search of secret documents which Faure had entrusted to her keeping, possibly relating to the Dreyfus affair.

The police immediately regarded her as a suspect in the killings but had no hard evidence and made a pretence of abandoning the investigation. But Steinheil herself would not let the affair rest. She made an attempt to frame her manservant, Rémy Couillard, by concealing a small pearl which she affirmed had been stolen at the time of the murder in a pocketbook belonging to Couillard; after that fabrication was discovered, she blamed Alexandre Wolff, the son of her old housekeeper, but he was able to establish an alibi. She was arrested in November 1908 and taken to Saint-Lazare Prison. 

The crime created a sensation in Paris. It was revealed that she had had a great number of admirers, including even King Sisowath of Cambodia. Opponents of the government tried to make political capital of the affair, the anti-Semitic even charging her with having poisoned President Faure. A sensational trial finally ended in her acquittal on 14 November 1909, although the judge called her stories &quot;tissues of lies&quot;.

==Later life==
After the trial she moved to London, where she was known as Mme de Serignac. She wrote &quot;My Memoirs&quot; in 1912. On 26 June 1917, she married Robert Scarlett, 6th Baron Abinger, who died in 1927. She lived at 24 Adelaide Crescent in Hove from that year and died in a nursing home in the town on 17 July 1954.

== In popular culture ==

* Steinheil is one of the main characters in the French TV drama, &quot;Paris Police 1900&quot;, which premiered in 2021 on Canal+ in France and BBC Four in the UK. She is played by Evelyne Brochu. 
* The French television film &quot;The President&#x27;s Mistress&quot; (&quot;La maîtresse du président&quot;, 2009) is a dramatized version of their relationship where Steinheil is played by Brazilian actress Cristiana Reali.

<text>Robert William Montana (October 23, 1920 – January 4, 1975) was an American comic strip artist who created the original likenesses for characters published by Archie Comics and in the newspaper strip &quot;Archie&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born in Stockton, California, to Roberta Pandolfini Montana and Ray Montana. Both were in show business: Roberta had been a Ziegfeld girl, and Ray performed banjo on the vaudeville circuit. As a result, Bob Montana traveled extensively as a child. He attended Haverhill High School in Haverhill, Massachusetts. and graduated from Manchester High School Central in Manchester, New Hampshire.

According to Jane (Donahue) Murphy, a high school classmate of Montana&#x27;s, Archie and his friends were based on people from their hometown and high school. She said Archie Andrews was based on Donahue&#x27;s cousin, Richard Heffernan; Veronica Lodge on Agatha Popoff, the daughter of the local football team&#x27;s doctor; Jughead Jones on a mischievous teen named &quot;Skinny&quot; Linnehan; while Miss Grundy may have been based on a high school typing and shorthand teacher named Lundstrom; however, Haverhill&#x27;s school librarian is also believed to be the model for Grundy.

==Career==
While freelancing at True Comics and Fox Comics, Montana created an adventure strip about four teenage boys and tried to sell it without success.

===Archie Comics===

When Montana started working for MLJ Comics he was asked to work up a high-school style comic-strip story, featuring Archie Andrews.

Bob Montana presented his four-boy strip to John Goldwater while working as a freelance artist at MLJ. Goldwater thought it would be more appealing to feature two boys and two girls than four boys. Goldwater liked the name Archibald (after a friend) but Montana liked Chick. They settled on Archie. Montana and Harry Lucey collaborated on the first comic book story which was featured in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; (Dec. 1941), and its popularity led MLJ to assign Montana to draw the first issue of &quot;Archie&quot; (Nov. 1942). After serving in WW2, in 1946, Montana was soon drawing the &quot;Archie&quot; comic newspaper strip, doing both the daily and Sunday strip, which over the next 35 years ran in over 750 newspapers worldwide.

==Personal life==
Montana served 3½ years in WW2 and was a sergeant at war&#x27;s end; during this time, he met and married Peggy Bertholet. They had four children: Paige, Lynn, Ray and Don.

He died at age 54 of an apparent heart attack while cross-country skiing near his New Hampshire home.

<doc id="560009" wikidata="Q1330709" url="?curid=560009" title="Aridity">
<text>Aridity is the condition of geographical regions which make up approximately 43% of total global available land area, characterized by low annual precipitation, increased temperatures, and limited water availability. These areas tend to fall upon degraded soils, and their health and functioning are key necessities of regulating ecosystems’ atmospheric components.

== Change over time ==

The distribution of aridity at any time is largely the result of the general circulation of the atmosphere. The latter does change significantly over time through climate change. For example, temperature increase by 1.5–2.1 percent across the Nile Basin over the next 30–40 years could change the region from semi-arid to arid, significantly reducing the land usable for agriculture. In addition, changes in land use can increase demands on soil water and thereby increase aridity.

A December 2024 report from the UNCCD concluded that more than three-quarters of the Earth&#x27;s land &quot;has become permanently dryer in recent decades&quot;, that &quot;drier climates now affecting vast regions across the globe will not return to how they were&quot;, and that a quarter of the global population lives in expanding drylands.

<doc id="560012" wikidata="Q57759" url="?curid=560012" title="Hermann Tilke">
<text>Hermann Tilke (born 31 December 1954) is a German engineer, racing driver and circuit designer, who has designed numerous Formula One motor racing circuits. His son is architect Carsten Tilke.

==Racing==
During the 1980s, Tilke competed in touring car racing, mainly on the old Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit. He also competed in VLN endurance racing and the 24 Hours Nürburgring. He and Dirk Adorf won some VLN races with a V8Star Series in 2003 and 2004.

==Civil engineering==
After completing his civil engineering degree with specialization in transport and traffic management at Fachhochschule Aachen, Tilke established Tilke Engineering in 1984, combining skills in architecture, civil engineering and electronic engineering to provide complete solutions for motor racing and waste disposal projects.

===Formula One===
Tilke is one of four designers recognised by the FIA but has, with the exception of the Silverstone redesign in 2010, been the only one to be commissioned to design Formula One tracks. One of his first minor tasks was to design and build a short access road at the Nürburgring, earned due to contacts made by his racing efforts there. His first major job was the transformation of the fast Österreichring to the much shorter A1-Ring in Austria, in the 1990s.

Tilke was involved in the radical overhauls of European circuits, such as the Hockenheimring, Circuit de Catalunya and Nürburgring, as well as Fuji Speedway in Japan.

Tilke secured the contracts to design many high-profile new world circuits from scratch, mainly in Asia but also in eastern Europe. He designed Sepang International Circuit, Bahrain International Circuit, Shanghai International Circuit, Istanbul Park Racing Circuit, Valencia Street Circuit, Marina Bay Street Circuit, Yas Marina Circuit, Korea International Circuit and the Buddh International Circuit. Tilke also designed the new Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, where F1 made its return to the United States in 2012. Tilke&#x27;s latest designs include Sochi Autodrom which hosted its first race in 2014 with the debut of Russia in F1, Kuwait Motor Town (Kuwait) which opened officially in 2019, and the Hanoi Street Circuit which was set for an inaugural race in April 2020 but got cancelled due to COVID-19.

Tilke has designed every track with several other engineers from Tilke Engineering, as well as F1&#x27;s former commercial rights holder Bernie Ecclestone. After viewing the track site and &quot;once factors such as topography, wind direction, infrastructure and soil quality are known&quot; the design work can begin. Tilke focuses on &quot;conceiving dramatic architecture that reflects the host country, like Sepang&#x27;s lotus-leaf grandstands in Malaysia&quot;, while also aiming for spectator comfort and clear viewing. He &quot;build[s] corners that promise a fast and interesting race but avoid pulling the field apart&quot;.

==Criticism==
Tilke&#x27;s track designs have been the subject of criticism. A 2009 profile in &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that Tilke &quot;has been accused of penning boring tracks and, even worse, of butchering legendary ones like Hockenheim.&quot; Russian Formula One commentator Alexey Popov coined the term &quot;Tilkedrome&quot; to emphasize the characteristic ennui of tracks designed by Tilke.

Former driver and team owner Jackie Stewart was critical of Tilke in a 2011 piece in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, blaming his designs for the lack of overtaking and excitement at many Formula One races, saying they &quot;are largely carbon copies of each other&quot;. Stewart, while praising the vast improvement the designs have brought to the sport&#x27;s safety as well as &quot;bringing fantastic amenities and luxuries to the sport&quot;, argued that the tracks have &quot;gone too far the other way&quot; in terms of safety. His primary complaint was that the large tarmac run-off areas fail to &quot;penalise mistakes&quot;; he cited the 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, where Mark Webber was unable to pass Fernando Alonso, despite the latter running wide on four occasions, because the track&#x27;s run-off areas did not impede him. Stewart suggested that the run-offs be made of a substance that slowed the cars down and thus punished drivers&#x27; mistakes. Webber echoed Stewart&#x27;s views, stating that he was &quot;spot on&quot;. 1980 world champion Alan Jones described Tilke&#x27;s designs as &quot;just one constant-radius corner after another&quot; and &quot;boring&quot;.

Others have defended him. Driver and commentator Anthony Davidson said that Tilke &quot;understands the demands of the modern cars...he gives us run-off areas and it&#x27;s all well thought out. They are enjoyable to race on because they suit modern F1 cars. At a track like Silverstone you do not get as much overtaking because it was designed for cars that were slower and did not depend on downforce for speed. But the circuits designed in recent years have a long straight and bigger braking zone.&quot; He particularly praised Turn Eight of Istanbul Park.

Tilke has secured contracts to design many new circuits.

<doc id="560047" wikidata="Q182090" url="?curid=560047" title="Oceanic climate">
<text>An oceanic climate, also known as a marine climate or maritime climate, is the temperate climate sub-type in Köppen classification represented as Cfb, typical of west coasts in higher middle latitudes of continents, generally featuring cool to warm summers and cool to mild winters (for their latitude), with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature. Oceanic climates can be found in both hemispheres generally between 40 and 60 degrees latitude, with subpolar versions extending to 70 degrees latitude in some coastal areas. Other varieties of climates usually classified together with these include subtropical highland climates, represented as Cwb or Cfb, and subpolar oceanic or cold subtropical highland climates, represented as Cfc or Cwc. Subtropical highland climates occur in some mountainous parts of the subtropics or tropics, some of which have monsoon influence, while their cold variants and subpolar oceanic climates occur near polar or tundra regions.

==Precipitation==

Locations with oceanic climates tend to feature frequent cloudy conditions with precipitation, low hanging clouds, and frequent fronts and storms. Thunderstorms are normally few, since strong daytime heating and hot and cold air masses meet infrequently in the regions, but are more common in subtropical highland climates where these air masses meet more frequently due to the influence of hotter weather in the subtropics or tropics, especially in monsoon-influenced climates. In most areas with an oceanic climate, precipitation comes in the form of rain for the majority of the year. Most oceanic climate zones, however, experience at least one snowfall per year. Snowfall is more frequent and commonplace in the subpolar oceanic climates due to the colder weather in those locations.

==Temperature==

Overall temperature characteristics of the oceanic climates feature cool temperatures and infrequent extremes of temperature. In the Köppen climate classification, oceanic climates have a mean temperature of or higher (or or higher) in the coldest month, compared to continental climates where the coldest month has a mean temperature of below (or ) in the coldest month. Summers are warm but not hot, with the warmest month having a mean temperature below .

Poleward of the latter is a subtype of it, the subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfc&quot;), with long but relatively mild (for their latitude) winters, and cool and short summers with average temperatures of at least for one to three months. Examples in the Northern Hemisphere include parts of coastal Iceland, the coast of Norway north of Bodø, the Scottish Highlands, the mountains of Vancouver Island, and Haida Gwaii in Canada. In the Southern Hemisphere examples include extreme southern Chile and Argentina (such as Punta Arenas and Ushuaia), the Falkland Islands, the Tasmanian Central Highlands, and parts of New Zealand.

==Cause ==

Oceanic climates are not necessarily found in coastal locations on the aforementioned parallels; however, in most cases oceanic climates parallel higher middle latitude oceans. The polar jet stream, which moves in a west to east direction across the middle latitudes, advances low pressure systems, storms, and fronts. In coastal areas of the higher middle latitudes (45–60° latitude), the prevailing onshore flow creates the basic structure of most oceanic climates. Oceanic climates are a product and reflection of the cool ocean adjacent to them. In the autumn, winter, and early spring, when the polar jet stream is most active, the frequent passing of marine weather systems creates the frequent fog, cloudy skies, and light drizzle often associated with oceanic climates. They are typically found poleward of Mediterranean climates, except in Australia where they are poleward of both such climates and humid subtropical climates due to the shape of the continent. Only in Europe do they penetrate far inland, where they eventually transition into warm-summer humid continental climates; in other continents, they are blocked by a large mountain range or limited by nearby oceans.

The North Atlantic Gulf Stream, a tropical oceanic current that passes north of the Caribbean and up the East Coast of the United States to North Carolina, then heads east-northeast to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, is thought to greatly modify the climate of northwest Europe. As a result of the North Atlantic Current, west coast areas located in high latitudes like Ireland, the UK, and Norway have much milder winters (for their latitude) than would otherwise be the case. The lowland attributes of western Europe also help drive marine air masses into continental areas, enabling cities such as Dresden, Prague, and Vienna to have maritime climates in spite of being located well inland from the ocean.

==Locations==

=== Europe ===

Oceanic climates in Europe occupy a large stretch of land, from Norway&#x27;s Atlantic coast, Ireland and the United Kingdom and southeast to some parts of Turkey. 

Western Europe is almost exclusively oceanic between 45°N to 54.913°N; including most of France (away from the Mediterranean), nearly all of Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, most of Luxembourg, most of Denmark, western Germany, northwestern Switzerland, south coast and western areas of Norway north to Skrova and extreme southern Sweden.

While most of Southern Europe is climatically Mediterranean, some parts of Southern Europe also have oceanic climates. However, these instances of the climate are highly variable, and often somewhat anomalous. The north coast of Spain, the western Azores off the coast of Portugal are too wet in summer to be Mediterranean, and too mild in summer to be humid subtropical, though they often have winter means above , unusual for European oceanic climates. 

Another anomalous case can be found in northwestern Turkey, including northern Istanbul. These places are, in a strict air-mass sense, not oceanic: they are affected by southerlies directly from the Mediterranean, and polar intrusions from Siberia. Yet their position near the Black Sea makes them too wet in summer to be Mediterranean, too mild during winter to be humid continental, and not hot enough in summer to be humid subtropical; therefore Köppen classifies them as oceanic. Despite their anomalous position, however, their temperatures, around in winter and in summer, are not wholly atypical for European oceanic climates.

Some Eastern European regions such as the north of Croatia and Serbia and some parts of the Czech Republic, also have oceanic climates; these are generally near the boundary for being humid continental. 

The line between oceanic and continental climates in Europe runs in a generally northwest to southeast direction. For example, western Germany is more impacted by milder Atlantic air masses than eastern Germany. Thus, winters across Europe become colder to the east, and (in some locations) summers become hotter. The line between oceanic Europe and Mediterranean Europe normally runs west to east and is related to changes in precipitation patterns and differences to seasonal temperatures; although intrusions of polar air, remnants of marine air-masses, and higher summer precipitation can create oceanic climates in Eastern Europe and transcontinental regions as far south as 40°N.
===The Americas===
The oceanic climate exists in an arc spreading across the northwestern coast of North America from the Alaskan panhandle to northern Washington. In addition, some east coast areas such as Block Island, Cape Cod, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and Nantucket have a similar climate. And in the highlands of Central and South America with the variant Cfb. An extensive area of oceanic climates distinguishes the coastal regions of southern Chile and extends into bordering Argentina.

===Africa===
The only noteworthy area of maritime climate at or near sea-level within Africa is in South Africa from Mossel Bay on the Western Cape coast to Plettenberg Bay (the Garden Route), with additional pockets of this climate inland of the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal coast. It is usually warm most of the year with no pronounced rainy season, but slightly more rain in autumn and spring. The Tristan da Cunha archipelago in the South Atlantic also has an oceanic climate.
===Asia and Oceania===
Although oceanic climate is rare in Asia, subtropical highland climates and cold subtropical highland climates can be found in parts of Southwestern China, and the Himalayan regions of the northern Indian subcontinent.

The oceanic climate is prevalent in the more southerly parts of Oceania. A mild maritime climate is in existence in New Zealand. In Australia, the climate is found in Tasmania, southern half of Victoria and southeastern New South Wales (southwards from Wollongong).

Some parts of the northeastern coast of Honshu, such as Mutsu, Aomori in Japan, feature this climate, which is rare in Asia due to the lack of a west coast in the middle latitudes.

===Indian Ocean===
Île Amsterdam and Île Saint-Paul, both part of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands, are located in the subtropics and have an oceanic climate (akin to Tristan da Cunha; see above).

==Varieties==
=== Marine west coast (Cfb) ===

Temperate oceanic climates, also known as &quot;marine mild winter&quot; climates or simply oceanic climates, are found either at middle latitudes. They are often found on or near the west coast of continents; hence another name for Cfb, &quot;marine west coast climates&quot;. In addition to moderate temperatures year-round, one of the characteristics is the absence of a dry season. Except for Europe, this type of climate is confined to narrow bands of territory, largely in mid or high latitudes, although it can appear in elevated areas of continental terrain in low latitudes, e.g. plateaus in the subtropics. It exists in both hemispheres between 35° and 60°: at low altitudes between Mediterranean, humid continental, and subarctic climates.

Western sea breezes ease temperatures and moderates the winter, especially if warm sea currents are present, and cause cloudy weather to predominate. Precipitation is constant, especially in colder months, when temperatures are warmer than elsewhere at comparable latitudes. This climate can occur farther inland if no mountain ranges are present or nearby. As this climate causes sufficient moisture year-round without permitting deep snow cover, vegetation typically prospers in this climate. Deciduous trees are predominant in this climate region. However, conifers such as spruce, pine, and cedar are also common in few areas, and fruits such as apples, pears, and grapes can often be cultivated here.

In the hottest month, the average temperature is below , and at least four months feature average temperatures higher than . The average temperature of the coldest month must not be colder than , or the climate will be classified as continental. The average temperature variations in the year are between , with average annual temperatures between . Rain values can vary from , depending on whether mountains cause orographic precipitation. Frontal cyclones can be common in marine west coast regions, with some areas experiencing more than 150 rainy days annually, but strong storms are rare.

Cfb climates are predominant in most of Europe except the northeast, as global temperatures became warmer towards late 20th and early 21st century. They are the main climate type in New Zealand and the Australian states of Tasmania, Victoria, and southeastern New South Wales (starting from the Illawarra region). In North America, they are found mainly in Vancouver Island and neighbouring parts of British Columbia, as well as many coastal areas of southeast Alaska. There are pockets of this iteration of Cfb climates in South American countries, mostly in regions of southern Chile and Argentina, parts of the provinces of Chubut, Santa Cruz, and southeast Buenos Aires province in Argentina. In Western Asia, the climate can be found on the Black Sea coast of northern Turkey and Georgia, often transitional to humid subtropical. While Cfb zones are rare in Africa, one dominates the coastline of the Eastern Cape in South Africa.

The climate subtype can also be found in Nantucket, Massachusetts (in the immediate west and northwest in transition for humid continental, the remainder of Cape Cod) and northeastern Georgia both in the eastern United States. It is also found in the highest portions of the Brazilian state of Bahia and Roraima (in transition or strongly influenced for &quot;Cwb&quot;), Brønnøy Municipality in Nordland at 65.28 °N (Norway north-central coast), the provinces of Sabah (northeastern Malaysia), and Baluchistan, Pakistan. Although there are more or less rare places associated with relatively isolated mountainous regions (e.g., North Oceania islands and China).

===Subtropical highland variety (Cfb, Cwb)===
The subtropical highland climate is a climate variety, often grouped together with oceanic climates, which exists in some mountainous or elevated portions of the world in either the subtropics or tropics. Despite the latitude, the higher elevations of these regions mean that the climate shares characteristics with oceanic climates.

Subtropical highland climates with uniform rainfall (&quot;Cfb&quot;) usually have rainfall spread relatively evenly throughout the year, similar to other oceanic climates, but unlike these climates, they have a high diurnal temperature variation and low humidity, owing to their inland location and relatively high elevation. Subtropical highland climates with monsoon influence (&quot;Cwb&quot;) have distinctive wet summers and dry winters.

In locations outside the tropics, other than the drying trend in the winter, subtropical highland climates tend to be essentially identical to an oceanic climate, with mild summers and noticeably cooler winters, plus, in some instances, some snowfall. In the tropics, a subtropical highland climate typically features mild weather year-round. Temperatures there remain relatively constant throughout the year and snowfall is seldom seen due to warmer winters than most oceanic climates.

Areas with this climate feature monthly averages below but above either or depending on isotherm used. At least one month&#x27;s average temperature is below . Without their elevation, many of these regions would likely feature either humid subtropical or tropical climates.

This type of climate exists in parts of east, south and southeastern Africa, interior southern Africa and elevated portions of eastern Africa as far north as Ethiopia and of western Africa (west region of Cameroon) up to the southwestern Angola highlands also share this climate type. It also exists in the exposed areas of the High Atlas, some mountainous areas across southern Europe, mountainous sections of North America, including parts of the southern Appalachians and the Central America Volcanic Arc. In South America, it can be found mainly in temperate mountainous areas in the Tropical Andes, Venezuelan Coastal Range, the highest elevations of Serra do Mar in Southeastern Brazil, and tepuis of the Guiana Shield, The highest elevations of the Brazilian Highlands, and due to variations in rainfall and temperature patterns in some places of the Tropical Andes in Bolivia, Perú, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela. Most of Yunnan and mountainous areas across Southeast Asia, parts of the Himalayas, parts of Sri Lanka, and parts of the Hawaiian Islands of Maui and Hawaii. In the Caribbean, only the peaks in the highest mountain ranges have this climate (including the Blue Mountains in Jamaica and Cerro Maravilla in Puerto Rico), with only Hispaniola&#x27;s Cordillera Central and Chaîne de la Selle having significant urban settlements under this climate zone, such as cities like Kenscoff in Haiti and Constanza in the Dominican Republic. 

===Subpolar oceanic and cold subtropical highland varieties (Cfc, Cwc)===

Areas with subpolar oceanic climates feature an oceanic climate but are usually located closer to polar regions, with long but relatively mild winters and short, cool summers. As a result of their location, these regions tend to be on the cool end of oceanic climates, approaching polar regions. Snowfall tends to be more common here than in other oceanic climates. Subpolar oceanic climates are less prone to temperature extremes than subarctic climates or continental climates, featuring milder winters than these climates. Subpolar oceanic climates feature only one to three months of average monthly temperatures of at least 10 °C (50 °F). As with oceanic climates, none of its average monthly temperatures fall below -3.0 °C (26.6 °F) or 0 °C depending on the isotherm used. Typically, these areas in the warmest month experience daytime maximum temperatures below 17 °C (63 °F), while the coldest month features highs slightly above freezing and lows near or just below freezing while keeping the average warm enough. It typically carries a &quot;Cfc&quot; designation, though very small areas in Argentina and Chile have summers sufficiently short to be &quot;Cwc&quot; with fewer than four months over .

This variant of an oceanic climate is found in parts of coastal Iceland, the Faroe Islands, upland/mountainous parts of Scotland and Northern England, northwestern coastal areas of Norway (most of Lofoten, Vesterålen, warmest part of Tromsø reaching to 71°N on some islands), uplands/highlands in western Norway, the Aleutian Islands of Alaska and northern parts of the Alaskan Panhandle, the southwest of Argentina and Chile, and a few highland areas of Tasmania, and the Australian and Southern Alps. This type of climate is even found in very remote parts of the New Guinea Highlands. The classification used for this regime is Cfc. Temperatures above and below are rare. In the most marine areas under this regime, temperatures above are extreme weather events, even during summer. 

Small areas in Yunnan, Sichuan; parts of Bolivia and Peru; and parts of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania have summers sufficiently short to be &quot;Cwc&quot; with fewer than four months over . This is the cold variant of the monsoon-influenced subtropical highland climate. El Alto, Bolivia is one of the few confirmed towns that features this variation of the subtropical highland climate.

<text>Cecil Gordon Lawson (3 December 1849 – 10 June 1882 London) was a British landscapist and illustrator.

==Life==
The youngest son of William Lawson of Edinburgh, a well-regarded portrait painter, and of a mother also known for her flower pieces, he was born in Fountain Place in Wellington, Shropshire. Two of his brothers (one of them, Malcolm, a clever musician and songwriter) were trained as artists, and Cecil was from childhood devoted to art with the intensity of a serious nature. Soon after his birth, the Lawsons moved to London.

In 1871, Lawson was living with his parents at 15 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, along with his two older brothers Francis Wilfrid Lawson (1842–1935), a &quot;historical painter and designer&quot; and Malcolm Leonard Lawson (1847–1918), a &quot;professor of music.&quot;

Lawson&#x27;s first works were studies of fruit, flowers, etc., in the manner of William Henry Hunt; followed by riverside Chelsea subjects. His first exhibit at the Royal Academy (1870) was &quot;Cheyne Walk,&quot; and in 1871 he sent two other Chelsea subjects. These gained full recognition from fellow-artists, if not from the public. Among his friends were now numbered Fred Walker, GJ Pinwell and their associates. Following them, he made a certain number of drawings for wood-engraving. In 1871 he contributed &quot;Summer Showers&quot; to a mixed charity exhibition held in support of those affected by the Franco-Prussian War.

Lawson&#x27;s Chelsea pictures had been painted in rather sombre tones; in &quot;A Hymn to Spring&quot; (1871–72; Santa Barbara Museum of Art) which was rejected by the Academy, he turned to a more colourful approach, helped by work done in North Wales and Ireland. Early in 1874 he made a short tour in the Netherlands, Belgium and Paris; and in the summer he painted the Kent countryside in his large &quot;The Hop-Gardens of England&quot; (1874; Tate, London). This was much praised at the Academy of 1876.

Lawson&#x27;s triumph was with the luxuriant canvas, &quot;The Minister&#x27;s Garden&quot;, exhibited in 1878 at the Grosvenor Gallery, and afterwards bought by Manchester Art Gallery. His 1878 showing at the Grosvenor Gallery was accompanied by &quot;Strayed&quot; (1878; Private collection) and &quot;Into the Valley: A Pastoral&quot; (1878; Private collection). This triumph was followed by several works conceived in a new and tragic mood. Lawson&#x27;s health began to fail, but he worked on. His later subjects are from the neighbourhood where he lived (the most famous being &quot;The August Moon&quot;, now Tate Britain, London) or from Yorkshire. Towards the end of 1881 he went to the French Riviera, returned in the spring.

Lawson suffered a relapse, and a visit to Eastbourne proved of no benefit. He died at West Brompton, of inflammation of the lungs, on 10 June 1882, and was buried at Haslemere.

==Assessment==
Lawson may be said to have restored to English landscape the tradition of Thomas Gainsborough, John Crome and John Constable, infused with an imaginative intensity of his own. Among English landscape painters of the latter part of the 19th century his is an outstanding name.

==Family==
In 1879 he married Constance Birnie Philip (1854–1929), a daughter (and eldest child) of the sculptor John Birnie Philip, and settled at Haslemere. Constance&#x27;s eldest sister Beatrix later married James McNeill Whistler in 1888, which would have made Lawson and Whistler brothers-in-law had Lawson lived. Constance and Cecil had one son, Cecil Constant Philip Lawson (1880–1967), born in London on 20 September 1880.

<text>William Henry Hunt (London 28 March 1790 – 10 February 1864), was an English watercolourist. Hunt was &quot;one of the key figures
in nineteenth-century English watercolour painting. His work was extensively collected in his lifetime, particularly his genre pictures of children, often in humorous situations, and his detailed, naturalistic still lifes of fruit, flowers, and birds&#x27; nests that earned him the nickname ‘Bird’s Nest’ Hunt.&quot;

==Early life==
Hunt was born at 8 Old Belton Street, now 7 Endell Street, near Covent Garden. His father, John Hunt, was a tin-plate worker, making and selling small containers, such as canisters and boxes, which he also decorated. Hunt&#x27;s uncle, a butcher, is recorded as having said of the artist, &quot;He was always a poor cripple, and as he was fit for nothing, they made an artist of him.&quot; This is at least partially true, as Hunt had deformed legs that hampered his movement and may well have contributed to his eventual abandonment of landscape work in favor of still life and figures.

In 1806 Hunt persuaded his father to allow him to train as an artist, becoming apprenticed for a term of seven years to John Varley, the watercolorist, drawing master, astrologer, and a close friend of William Blake. Apparently Hunt made good progress under Varley&#x27;s tutelage, as he exhibited three oil paintings at the Royal Academy in 1807 and continued to exhibit there for several years following. In 1808 he was admitted as a student to the Royal Academy Schools.

Through Varley, Hunt was introduced into the circle of the collector, amateur, and patron of artists Dr. Thomas Monro, Principal Physician of Bethlem Hospital, whose informal drawing academy attracted many gifted young artists. Artists met at the doctor&#x27;s home in Adelphi Terrace on winter evenings and also at his country home at Bushey, Hertfordshire The doctor often invited Hunt to Bushey for extended periods, to paint from nature under the doctor&#x27;s instruction. According to Martin Hardie, &quot;Some of [Hunt&#x27;s] most charming outdoor drawings were made round about Bushey, &#x27;where he was trundled on a sort of barrow with a hood over it...while he made sketches&#x27;.&quot;. Dr. Munro&#x27;s patronage proved critical to Hunt&#x27;s progress as an artist.

==Royal Watercolour Society==
By 1822 Hunt was living independently of his family. From 1822 to 1825 he again exhibited at the Royal Academy, after which he ceased entirely. This may be because on 9 April 1824 he was elected an associate member of the Society of Painters in Watercolours (later the Royal Watercolour Society), becoming a full member two years later, in June 1826. From his earliest contributions until 1864, the year he died, Hunt was a prolific exhibitor at the society&#x27;s annual exhibitions, contributing a total of 765 works in all.

==Painting style==
Hunt&#x27;s early work shows the influence of his teacher, John Varley, as well as his patron, Dr. Thomas Munro and Henry Edridge, a close associate of Munro. Architectural subjects and country landscapes dominated his early work. Loose drawing in pencil or pen and fluid, clear color washes are the hallmarks. His subjects, especially those of his later life, are often simple; but, considered technically, his works exhibit all the resources of the watercolour painter&#x27;s craft, from the purest transparent tinting to the boldest use of gouache, stippling on prepared opaque grounds, use of rough paper, and scraping for highlights and texture. His sense of colour is perhaps as true as that of any English artist. He was, says John Ruskin, all in all, the finest ever painter of still life. Several characteristic examples of Hunt&#x27;s work, as the &quot;Boy with a Goat,&quot; &quot;A Brown Study, Plums,&quot; &quot;and Primroses and Birds&#x27; Nests&quot; are in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

According to the Redgraves, &quot;The works of Hunt differ widely from his contemporaries: they have a character of their own, and many qualities which place him as an artist, in his somewhat narrow range, on a level with the highest.&quot;.
==Death==
Hunt died of apoplexy on 10 February 1864. He was buried on the western side of Highgate Cemetery on 15 February 1864, attended to the grave by a number of artist colleagues. &quot;The Reader&quot; (27 February 1864) opined &quot;we were but faintly beginning to appreciate and understand his genius when he was taken from us--one the greatest artists of the Century.&quot;

==Collections==
Examples of Hunt&#x27;s work are held in a number of public collections, including the Victoria and Albert Museum, Tate Gallery, The British Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, Yale Center for British Art, Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens, The Huntington Library, Whitworth Art Gallery, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, Lady Lever Art Gallery, National Portrait Gallery (London), Art Gallery of New South Wales, Williamson Art Gallery and Museum (Birkenhead), Harris Museum and Art Gallery (Preston, Lancashire), Ashmolean Museum, Courtauld Institute of Art, Fitzwilliam Museum, High Museum of Art, Atlanta, The Higgins Art Gallery and Museum, Blackburn Museum and Art Gallery, Towneley Hall.

<doc id="560061" wikidata="Q503359" url="?curid=560061" title="Psilocybe semilanceata">
<text>Psilocybe semilanceata, commonly known as the liberty cap, is a species of fungus which produces the psychoactive compounds psilocybin, psilocin and baeocystin. It is both one of the most widely distributed psilocybin mushrooms in nature, and one of the most potent. The mushrooms have a distinctive conical to bell-shaped cap, up to in diameter, with a small nipple-like protrusion on the top. They are yellow to brown, covered with radial grooves when moist, and fade to a lighter color as they mature. Their stipes tend to be slender and long, and the same color or slightly lighter than the cap. The gill attachment to the stipe is adnexed (narrowly attached), and they are initially cream-colored before tinting purple to black as the spores mature. The spores are dark purplish-brown en masse, ellipsoid in shape, and measure 10.5–15 by 6.5–8.5 micrometres.

The mushroom grows in grassland habitats, especially wetter areas. But unlike &quot;P. cubensis&quot;, the fungus does not grow directly on dung; rather, it is a saprobic species that feeds off decaying grass roots. It is widely distributed in the temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, and has been reported occasionally in temperate areas of the Southern Hemisphere as well. The earliest reliable history of &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; intoxication dates back to 1799 in London, and in the 1960s the mushroom was the first European species confirmed to contain psilocybin.

The possession or sale of psilocybin mushrooms is illegal in many countries.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The species was first described by Elias Magnus Fries as &quot;Agaricus semilanceatus&quot; in his 1838 work &quot;Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici&quot;. Paul Kummer transferred it to &quot;Psilocybe&quot; in 1871 when he raised many of Fries&#x27;s sub-groupings of &quot;Agaricus&quot; to the level of genus. &quot;Panaeolus semilanceatus&quot;, named by Jakob Emanuel Lange in both 1936 and 1939 publications, is a synonym. According to the taxonomical database MycoBank, several taxa once considered varieties of &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; to be synonymous with the species now known as &quot;Psilocybe strictipes&quot;: the &quot;caerulescens&quot; variety described by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1887 (originally named &quot;Agaricus semilanceatus&quot; var. &quot;coerulescens&quot; by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in 1881), the &quot;microspora&quot; variety described by Rolf Singer in 1969, and the &quot;obtusata&quot; variety described by Marcel Bon in 1985.

Several molecular studies published in the 2000s demonstrated that &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, as it was defined then, was polyphyletic. The studies supported the idea of dividing the genus into two clades, one consisting of the bluing, hallucinogenic species in the family Hymenogastraceae, and the other the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species in the family Strophariaceae. However, the generally accepted lectotype (a specimen later selected when the original author of a taxon name did not designate a type) of the genus as a whole was &quot;Psilocybe montana&quot;, which is a non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species. If the non-bluing, non-hallucinogenic species in the study were to be segregated, it would have left the hallucinogenic clade without a valid name. To resolve this dilemma, several mycologists proposed in a 2005 publication to conserve the name &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, with &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; as the type. As they explained, conserving the name &quot;Psilocybe&quot; in this way would prevent nomenclatural changes to a well-known group of fungi, many species of which are &quot;linked to archaeology, anthropology, religion, alternate life styles, forensic science, law enforcement, laws and regulation&quot;. Further, the name &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; had historically been accepted as the lectotype by many authors in the period 1938–68. The proposal to conserve the name &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, with &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; as the type was accepted unanimously by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi in 2009.

The mushroom takes its common name from the Phrygian cap, also known as the &quot;liberty cap&quot;, which it resembles; &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; shares its common name with &quot;P. pelliculosa&quot;, a species from which it is more or less indistinguishable in appearance. The Latin word for Phrygian cap is &quot;pileus&quot;, nowadays the technical name for what is commonly known as the &quot;cap&quot; of a fungal fruit body. In the 18th century, Phrygian caps were placed on Liberty poles, which resemble the stipe of the mushroom. The generic name is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;psilos&quot; (ψιλός) &#x27;smooth, bare&#x27; and Byzantine Greek &quot;kubê&quot; (κύβη) &#x27;head&#x27;. The specific epithet comes from Latin &quot;semi&quot; &#x27;half, somewhat&#x27; and &quot;lanceata&quot;, from &quot;lanceolatus&quot; &#x27;spear-shaped&#x27;.

==Description==
The cap of &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; is in diameter and tall. It varies in shape from sharply conical to bell-shaped, often with a prominent papilla (a nipple-shaped structure), and does not change shape considerably as it ages. The cap margin is initially rolled inward but unrolls to become straight or even curled upwards in maturity. The cap is hygrophanous, meaning it assumes different colors depending on its state of hydration. When it is moist, the cap is ochraceous to pale brown to dark chestnut brown, but darker in the center, often with a greenish-blue tinge. When moist, radial grooves (striations) can be seen on the cap that correspond to the positions of the gills underneath. When the cap is dry, it becomes much paler, a light yellow-brown color. Moist mushrooms have sticky surfaces that result from a thin gelatinous film called a pellicle. This film becomes apparent if a piece of the cap is broken by bending it back and peeling away the piece. When the cap dries from exposure to the sun, the film turns whitish and is no longer peelable.

On the underside of the mushroom&#x27;s cap, there are between 15 and 27 individual narrow gills that are moderately crowded together, and they have a narrowly adnexed to almost free attachment to the stipe. Their color is initially pale brown, but becomes dark gray to purple-brown with a lighter edge as the spores mature. The slender yellowish-brown stipe is long by thick, and usually slightly thicker towards the base. The mushroom has a thin cobweb-like partial veil that does not last long before disappearing; sometimes, the partial veil leaves an on the stipe that may be darkened by spores. The flesh is thin and membrane-like, and roughly the same color as the surface tissue. It has a (similar to freshly ground flour) odor and taste. All parts of the mushroom will stain a bluish color if handled or bruised, and it may naturally turn blue with age.

===Microscopic characteristics===
In deposit, the spores are a deep reddish purple-brown color. The use of an optical microscope can reveal further details: the spores are oblong when seen in side view, and oblong to oval in frontal view, with dimensions of 10.5–15 by 6.5–8.5 μm. The basidia (spore bearing cells of the hymenium), are 20–31 by 5–9 μm, four-spored, and have clamps at their bases; there are no basidia found on the sterile gill edge. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 15–30 by 4–7 μm, and are flask-shaped with long thin necks that are 1–3.5 μm wide. &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; does not have pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The cap cuticle is up to 90 μm thick, and is made of a tissue layer called an —a gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to the cap surface. The hyphae comprising the ixocutis are cylindrical, hyaline, and 1–3.5 μm wide. Immediately under the cap cuticle is the &quot;subpellis&quot;, made of hyphae that are 4–12 μm wide with yellowish-brown encrusted walls. There are clamp connections present in the hyphae of all tissues.

The anamorphic form of &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; is an asexual stage in the fungus&#x27;s life cycle involved in the development of mitotic diaspores (conidia). In culture, grown in a petri dish, the fungus forms a white to pale orange cottony or felt-like mat of mycelia. The conidia formed are straight to curved, measuring 2.0–8.0 by 1.1–2.0 μm, and may contain one to several small intracellular droplets. Although little is known of the anamorphic stage of &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; beyond the confines of laboratory culture, in general, the morphology of the asexual structures may be used as classical characters in phylogenetic analyses to help understand the evolutionary relationships between related groups of fungi.

Scottish mycologist Roy Watling described sequestrate (truffle-like) or secotioid versions of &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; he found growing in association with regular fruit bodies. These versions had elongated caps, long and wide at the base, with the inward curved margins closely hugging the stipe from the development of membranous flanges. Their gills were narrow, closely crowded together, and anastomosed (fused together in a vein-like network). The color of the gills was sepia with a brownish vinaceous (red wine-colored) cast, and a white margin. The stipes of the fruit bodies were long by thick, with about of stipe length covered by the extended cap. The thick-walled ellipsoid spores were 12.5–13.5 by 6.5–7 μm. Despite the significant differences in morphology, molecular analysis showed the secotioid version to be the same species as the typical morphotype.

==Similar species==

There are several other &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species that may be confused with &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; due to similarities in physical appearance. &quot;P. strictipes&quot; is a slender grassland species that is differentiated macroscopically from &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; by the lack of a prominent papilla. &quot;P. mexicana&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;Mexican liberty cap&quot;, is also similar in appearance, but is found in manure-rich soil in subtropical grasslands in Mexico. It has somewhat smaller spores than &quot;P. semilanceata&quot;, typically 8–9.9 by 5.5–7.7 μm. Another lookalike species is &quot;P. samuiensis&quot;, found in Thailand, where it grows in well-manured clay-like soils or among paddy fields. This mushroom can be distinguished from &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; by its smaller cap, up to in diameter, and its rhomboid-shaped spores. &quot;P. pelliculosa&quot; is physically similar to such a degree that it may be indistinguishable in the field. It differs from &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; by virtue of its smaller spores, measuring 9–13 by 5–7 μm.

&quot;P. semilanceata&quot; has also been confused with the toxic muscarine-containing species &quot;Inocybe geophylla&quot;, a whitish mushroom with a silky cap, yellowish-brown to pale grayish gills, and a dull yellowish-brown spore print.

==Ecology and habitat==
&quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot; fruits solitarily or in groups on rich and acidic soil, typically in grasslands, such as meadows, pastures, or lawns. It is often found in pastures that have been fertilized with sheep or cow dung, although it does not typically grow directly on the dung.

&quot;P. semilanceata&quot;, like all others species of the genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, is a saprobic fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by breaking down organic matter. The mushroom is also associated with sedges in moist areas of fields, and it is thought to live on the decaying root remains.

Like some other grassland psilocybin mushroom species such as &quot;P. mexicana&quot;, &quot;P. tampanensis&quot; and &quot;Conocybe cyanopus&quot;, &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; may form sclerotia, a dormant form of the fungus, which affords it some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters.

Laboratory tests have shown &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; to suppress the growth of the soil-borne water mold &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, a virulent plant pathogen that causes the disease root rot. When grown in dual culture with other saprobic fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of grasses from its habitat, &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; significantly suppresses their growth. This antifungal activity, which can be traced at least partly to two phenolic compounds it secretes, helps it compete successfully with other fungal species in the intense competition for nutrients provided by decaying plant matter. Using standard antimicrobial susceptibility tests, &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot; was shown to strongly inhibit the growth of the human pathogen methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA). The source of the antimicrobial activity is unknown.

==Distribution==
&quot;Psilocybe&quot; authority Gastón Guzmán, in his 1983 monograph on psilocybin mushrooms, considered &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot; the world&#x27;s most widespread psilocybin mushroom species, as it has been reported on 18 countries.
In Europe, &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; has a widespread distribution, and is found in Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Channel Islands, Czech republic, Denmark, Estonia, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Ukraine. It is generally agreed that the species is native to Europe; Watling has demonstrated that there exists little difference between specimens collected from Spain and Scotland, at both the morphological and genetic level.

The mushroom also has a widespread distribution in North America. In Canada it has been collected from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and Quebec. In the United States, it is most common in the Pacific Northwest, west of the Cascade Mountains, where it fruits abundantly in autumn and early winter; fruiting has also been reported to occur infrequently during spring months. Charles Horton Peck reported the mushroom to occur in New York in the early 20th century, and consequently, much literature published since then has reported the species to be present in the eastern United States. Guzmán later examined Peck&#x27;s herbarium specimen, and in his comprehensive 1983 monograph on &quot;Psilocybe&quot;, concluded that Peck had misidentified it with the species now known as &quot;Panaeolina foenisecii&quot;. &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; is much less common in South America, where it has been recorded in Chile. It is also known in Australia (where it may be an introduced species) and New Zealand, where it grows in high-altitude grasslands. In 2000, it was reported from Golaghat, in the Indian state of Assam. In 2017, it was reported from Charsadda, in the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

==Psychoactive use==
The first reliably documented report of &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot; intoxication involved a British family in 1799, who prepared a meal with mushrooms they had picked in London&#x27;s Green Park. According to the chemist Augustus Everard Brande, the father and his four children experienced typical symptoms associated with ingestion, including pupil dilation, spontaneous laughter and delirium. The identification of the species responsible was made possible by James Sowerby&#x27;s 1803 book &quot;Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms&quot;, which included a description of the fungus, then known as &quot;Agaricus glutinosus&quot; (originally described by Moses Ashley Curtis in 1780). According to German mycologist Jochen Gartz, the description of the species is &quot;fully compatible with current knowledge about &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot;.&quot;

In the early 1960s, the Swiss scientist Albert Hofmann—known for the synthesis of the psychedelic drug LSD—chemically analyzed &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; fruit bodies collected in Switzerland and France by the botanist Roger Heim. Using the technique of paper chromatography, Hofmann confirmed the presence of 0.25% (by weight) psilocybin in dried samples. Their 1963 publication was the first report of psilocybin in a European mushroom species; previously, it had been known only in &quot;Psilocybe&quot; species native to Mexico, Asia and North America. This finding was confirmed in the late 1960s with specimens from Scotland and England, Czechoslovakia (1973), Germany (1977), Norway (1978), and Belgium and Finland (1984). In 1965, forensic characterization of psilocybin-containing mushrooms seized from college students in British Columbia identified &quot;P. semilanceata&quot;—the first recorded case of intentional recreational use of the mushroom in Canada. The presence of the psilocybin analog baeocystin was confirmed in 1977. Several studies published since then support the idea that the variability of psilocybin content in &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; is low, regardless of country of origin.

===Properties===
Several studies have quantified the amounts of hallucinogenic compounds found in the fruit bodies of &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot;. In 1993, Gartz reported an average of 1% psilocybin (expressed as a percentage of the dry weight of the fruit bodies), ranging from a minimum of 0.2% to a maximum of 2.37% making it one of the most potent species (but significantly less potent than panaeolus cyanescens). In an earlier analysis, Tjakko Stijve and Thom Kuyper (1985) found a high concentration in a single specimen (1.7%) in addition to a relatively high concentration of baeocystin (0.36%). Smaller specimens tend to have the highest percent concentrations of psilocybin, but the absolute amount is highest in larger mushrooms. A Finnish study assayed psilocybin concentrations in old herbarium specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old. Michael Beug and Jeremy Bigwood, analyzing specimens from the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, reported psilocybin concentrations ranging from 0.62% to 1.28%, averaging 1.0 ±0.2%. They concluded that the species was one of the most potent, as well as the most constant in psilocybin levels. In a 1996 publication, Paul Stamets defined a &quot;potency rating scale&quot; based on the total content of psychoactive compounds (including psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin) in 12 species of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; mushrooms. Although there are certain caveats with this technique—such as the erroneous assumption that these compounds contribute equally to psychoactive properties—it serves as a rough comparison of potency between species. Despite its small size, &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot; is considered a &quot;moderately active to extremely potent&quot; hallucinogenic mushroom (meaning the combined percentage of psychoactive compounds is typically between 0.25% to greater than 2%), and of the 12 mushrooms they compared, only 3 were more potent: &quot;P. azurescens&quot;, &quot;P. baeocystis&quot;, and &quot;P. bohemica&quot;. however this data has become obsolete over the years as more potent cultivars have been discovered for numerous species, especially panaeolus cyanescens which holds the current world record for most potent mushrooms described in published research. According to Gartz (1995), &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; is Europe&#x27;s most popular psychoactive species.

Several reports have been published in the literature documenting the effects of consumption of &quot;P. semilanceata&quot;. Typical symptoms include visual distortions of color, depth and form, progressing to visual hallucinations. The effects are similar to the experience following consumption of LSD, although milder. Common side effects of mushroom ingestion include pupil dilation, increased heart rate, unpleasant mood, and overresponsive reflexes. As is typical of the symptoms associated with psilocybin mushroom ingestion, &quot;the effect on mood in particular is dependent on the subject&#x27;s pre-exposure personality traits&quot;, and &quot;identical doses of psilocybin may have widely differing effects in different individuals.&quot; Although most cases of intoxication resolve without incident, there have been isolated cases with severe consequences, especially after higher dosages or persistent use. In one case reported in Poland in 1998, an 18-year-old man developed Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome, arrhythmia, and suffered myocardial infarction after ingesting &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; frequently over the period of a month. The cardiac damage and myocardial infarction was suggested to be a result of either coronary vasoconstriction, or because of platelet hyperaggregation and occlusion of small coronary arteries.

====Danger of misidentification====
One danger of attempting to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, especially for novice mushroom hunters, is the possibility of misidentification with toxic species. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous &quot;Cortinarius rubellus&quot; for &quot;P. semilanceata&quot;. As a result, he suffered end-stage kidney failure, and required a kidney transplant. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity &quot;P. semilanceata&quot; was reported by Polish scientists in 2007. Poisonous Psathyrella species can easily be misidentified as liberty caps.

==Legal status==

The legal status of psilocybin mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Class A (United Kingdom) or Schedule I (US) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including &quot;P. semilanceata&quot;, is therefore prohibited by extension. Although many European countries remained open to the use and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban, starting in the 2000s (decade) there has been a tightening of laws and enforcements. In the Netherlands, where the drug was once routinely sold in licensed cannabis coffee shops and smart shops, laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms—the final European country to do so.
They are legal in Jamaica and Brazil and decriminalised in Portugal. In the United States, the city of Denver, Colorado, voted in May 2019 to decriminalize the use and possession of psilocybin mushrooms. In November 2020, voters passed Oregon Ballot Measure 109, making Oregon the first state to both decriminalize psilocybin and also legalize it for therapeutic use. Ann Arbor, Michigan, and the county it resides in have decriminalized magic mushrooms. Possession, sale and use are now legal within the county. In 2021, the City Councils of Somerville, Northampton, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Seattle, Washington, voted for decriminalization.

===Sweden===
The Riksdag added &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata&quot; to Narcotic Drugs Punishments Act under &quot;Swedish schedule I&quot; (&quot;substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use&quot;) as of 1 October 1997, published by Medical Products Agency (MPA) in regulation &quot;LVFS 1997:12&quot; listed as &quot;Psilocybe semilanceata (toppslätskivling)&quot;.

<text>Hillbrow () is an inner city residential neighbourhood of Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, South Africa. It is known for its high levels of population density, unemployment, poverty, prostitution and crime.

It had a large and active Jewish community for much of the twentieth century and housed several Orthodox synagogues such as the Great Synagogue and Poswohl Synagogue. Temple Israel, the oldest Reform synagogue in the country, continues to hold services. In the 1970s it was an Apartheid-designated &quot;whites only&quot; area under the Group Areas Act, but later became a &quot;grey area&quot;, where people of different ethnicities lived together. It acquired a cosmopolitan and politically progressive feel, and was one of the first identifiable gay and lesbian areas in urban South Africa. However, due to the mass growth of the population of poor and unemployed people after the end of Apartheid, crime soared and the streets became strewn with rubbish. This, together with lack of investment and fear led to an exodus of middle-class residents in the 1980s and the decay of major buildings, leaving in its wake an urban slum by the 1990s.

Today, the majority of the residents are incoming migrants from the townships, rural areas and the rest of Africa, many living in abject poverty. An urban regeneration programme is underway. There are street markets, mainly used by local residents, and the Johannesburg Art Gallery contains work by major local artists including William Kentridge.

==History==
Prior to the discovery of gold on the Witwatersrand in 1886, the suburb laid on government owned land called &quot;Randjeslaagte&quot; that now makes up the Johannesburg CBD. It was a triangular shaped piece of waste land not used for farming and the future suburb lies in the northern apex of the triangle. The origin of its name is simple, the suburb lies on the brow of the east west mountain ridge that crosses the Johannesburg CBD. The land was owned as claims by J. Nicholls who sold them to Transvaal Mortgage, Loan &amp; Finance Company. It was laid out as a residential suburb during 1894 and 1895, with Richard Currie auctioning the stands. In 1897 it became part of Johannesburg&#x27;s Sanitary Board. After World War Two, developers started purchasing the stands at values beyond their worth and eventually turned it into blocks of flats.
===Jewish community===
Since the beginning of the 1920s, Hillbrow was home to a growing and stable community of Jewish residents. 
Jewish residents and investors were responsible for building most of Hillbrow&#x27;s buildings. The neighbourhood was also home to a number of popular meeting places for Jewish residents, such as the Florian cafe on Kotze Street. In later decades the cafe was often frequented by Jewish and non-Jewish patrons on the political left. It was here that Jewish anti-apartheid activist, Rusty Bernstein began to develop his political consciousness. He was with Kurt Jonas, son of German Jewish migrants and his fellow student at the Architecture School of the University of the Witwatersrand. Through this encounter with Jonas he learned of &quot;the invisible world of black workers and trade unions which existed on my own doorstep.&quot; 

The former Great Synagogue is located on Wolmarans Street. It is considered the city&#x27;s mother synagogue and &quot;the crown jewel of Orthodox Judaism in South Africa.&quot; Hillbrow is also home to Temple Israel, the oldest Reform synagogue in the country. The Art Deco building was designed by Herman Kallenbach and has been granted heritage status. Hillbrow is also home to the former Poswohl Synagogue on Mooi Street. The name refers to Pasvalys in Lithuania where the original members emigrated from at the turn of the century. It was declared a National Monument under old NMC legislation on 4 December 1981.

In the 1960s and 1970s, many elderly Jewish people purchased flats in Hillbrow, planning to stay there for the final chapter of their lives. There was an uptick in Jewish migration out of the inner city suburbs into the northern suburbs from the mid-1970s.

In 1967 the press reported confrontations between local Jewish youth and German immigrants at a beer hall in Hillbrow. The Germans made Hitler salutes, prompting protests from local Jewish youth. The West German embassy in South Africa issued a statement deploring the salute, blaming “irresponsible youths who were too young to experience Nazism” for celebrating the regime. Gideon Jacobs, a member of the opposition requested that the confrontations be the subject of a discussion in parliament. A South African branch of the British neo-fascist National Front was established in 1978 and spread anti-semitic and racist pamphlets about Jewish landlords renting to non-white tenants in the suburb.

A number of Jewish architects also contributed to Hillbrow&#x27;s urban landscape. Architect Harold Le Roith sought to &quot;green&quot; the neighbourhood by introducing pavement gardens and planting to Golden Oaks, an apartment building he designed in 1976. He also designed Cresthill Mansions in Hillbrow, which is now used as social housing.

In the 1970s, Jewish couple, Isaac and Gloria Rootshtain purchased the Cranbrook Hotel on 58 Leyds Street. The building, a residential hotel, had been designed by Harold Le Roith and featured in Britain&#x27;s influential &quot;The Architectural Review&quot; magazine in 1953. The couple reopened the hotel as a kosher hotel, renaming it The Connoisseur. Gloria wrote South Africa&#x27;s first celebrity cookbook, &quot;Cooking with a Connoisseur&quot; in 1982. The Connoisseur operated as a kosher hotel until its sale in 1989, when the Rootshtain&#x27;s made aliyah to Israel. 

A small number of mostly elderly and impoverished Jews continue to live in Hillbrow and neighbouring Berea. They are mostly supported by Jewish charities in Johannesburg.

===Gay community===
In the mid-20th century, Hillbrow developed a reputation for its growing gay community. Many gay establishments and publications were founded in Hillbrow from the 1960s forward. The gay community was strong and large enough in Hillbrow that the conservative ruling National Party, which instituted apartheid, fielded a pro-gay rights candidate, Leon de Beer, in the 1987 elections. De Beer&#x27;s victorious campaign was heavily advertised in the Hillbrow-based gay publication &quot;Exit&quot; and his campaign promises were to both advance gay rights in parliament and reinstate Hillbrow as a whites-only district. His campaign garnered enough support from the gay community that he won the election, becoming the first elected official in South Africa to run and win on a pro-gay platform.

In 1990, one of the first training and information centres for HIV in South Africa was established in Hillbrow, initially catering mainly to white gay men. As the racial demographic in Hillbrow radically shifted, so too did the people in need of HIV-related care, and by the late 1990s the clinics mainly worked with black heterosexual women. Hillbrow experienced a heavy decline and most of the gay community, which was predominantly white, left the area within the decade.

==Social action==

A number of social action groups and organisations exist in the suburb to alleviate the difficult conditions challenges. In 1990 Jean du Plessis and Adele du Plessis founded The House Group, an organization with several shelters and programs aimed at retrieving and rehabilitating female child victims of commercial sexual exploitation. The organization&#x27;s first address in Hillbrow was on 52 Soper Road, close to Ponte City. In 1993 they moved to two adjacent premises on 60 Olivia Road (at the foot of the Hillbrow Tower) where the organization had The House Drop-in Centre and Intombi Shelter. The House Group were pioneers in pushing for legislation that would provide for equal rights for girls in shelters (legislation already supported boys in shelters). In 1997, the Gauteng Provincial Government proclaimed the first legislation that allowed shelters for female children.

== Landmarks ==
=== Constitution Hill ===
The Constitution Hill precinct, seat of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, is located on the western edge of Hillbrow, and is part of a major government and private sector initiative to revitalize the area and the rest of the CBD.

=== Hillbrow Tower ===
The Hillbrow Tower, a telecommunication tower, dominates the Johannesburg city skyline, featured in many picture postcard views of the city. It has become a symbol of the city and appears in the city seal. Completed in 1971, it rises to a height of 270 metres, thus making it the tallest man-made structure with a lift in Africa. Initially named the JG Strijdom Tower, it became popularly known simply as the Hillbrow tower, and in May 2005 it was renamed to Telkom Joburg Tower, with its new name displayed prominently in lights. It once featured a luxury rotating restaurant, but that was closed in 1981 due to security fears and is unlikely to be reopened.

=== Ponte City ===
Ponte City is the tallest residential building in Johannesburg and one of the city&#x27;s most striking urban landmarks. It was designed by architect Rodney Grosskopff (who also designed other South African landmarks such as the Johannesburg Civic Theatre) and completed in 1975.

The building is distinct due both to its height, rising to 54 storeys above one of the highest points in Johannesburg, as well as its cylindrical shape. During its prime, Ponte City was one of the city&#x27;s most sought-after addresses, but with inner-city urban decay setting in, it has become run-down, over-populated, and unsafe. The building was placed under new management in 1999, and with regular maintenance reinstated and gradual restoration, coupled with council, provincial, and government initiatives to rehabilitate Hillbrow, it began to find some shine again. In February 2007, Danny Boyle, the British director of &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, announced plans to use the building as a film set in a future release.

The documentary depicted the state of complete abandon and lawlessness in some parts of the city, specifically in Hillbrow. In January 2013, Al Jazeera English aired a &quot;Witness&quot; documentary about Hillbrow described as &quot;A personal journey to Hillbrow, where human spirit, hope and enterprise triumph in this crime-ridden melting pot in the heart of South Africa.&quot;

===Photography===
The suburb was the subject of several photographs by the renowned photographer, David Goldblatt. &quot;Hillbrow, Johannesburg, South Africa 1973&quot; depicts a white family amid the context of the Group Areas Act designating the area &quot;Whites-only&quot;. &quot;Domestic Worker on Abel Road, Hillbrow, Johannesburg March 1973&quot;, depicts a black domestic worker. Both photographs are held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. &quot;Sunday morning: A not-White family living illegally in the &quot;White&quot; group area of Hillbrow, Johannesburg&quot; depicts a black family living in Hillbrow in defiance of the Group Areas Act. The photograph is part of the collection at Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. In 2010, some of his Hillbrow photographs featured in the exhibition &quot;South African Photographs: David Goldblatt&quot; at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan. They included &quot;Holdup in Hillbrow, Johannesburg, November 1963&quot;, depicting a small white child with a toy gun playing with a black man. &quot;Baby with childminders and dogs in the Alexandra Street Park, Hillbrow, Johannesburg, 1972&quot; shows a white baby with black childminders. These photographs were on loan from the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg for the exhibition. His other photographs from the area include: &quot;The watchman, Balnagask Court, Hillbrow. June 1972&quot;, &quot;Woman shopping, Hillbrow. 1972&quot; and &quot;Man with an injured arm, Hillbrow. June 1972&quot;.

<text>George John Pinwell (London 26 December 1842 – 8 September 1875 London), was a British illustrator and watercolourist.

==Biography==
Pinwell was born on 26 December 1842 at 12 Great Mays Buildings, London. He was baptised on 27 July 1845, at St. Mark&#x27;s, Surbiton, south-west London, along with his younger brother Henry (born c. 1845). His parents were John Pinwell, a carpenter or builder, and his wife, Mary Ann Baker. Pinwell&#x27;s father was thought to have been involved in building the original Surbiton railway station in south-west London. His mother was &quot;a rough, illiterate woman&quot;, and &quot;a rough and determined person.&quot;

Pinwell&#x27;s father dies in 1854, leaving the family in very straitened circumstances. He apparently worked as a butterman&#x27;s boy in the City Road, London whose work, among other things was to stand outside the shop on Saturday nights shouting &quot;Buy| Buy| Buy!&quot;

He then worked making designs for a firm of embroiderers. In the 1861 census he recorded his occupation as &quot;designer of Embroidery&quot;. His two younger brothers Henry (born c. 1845) and Alfred (born c. 1847), both had their occupation listed as house carpenter.

His work on embroidery design led to him meeting his future wife Isabella Marcy Stevens (c. 1843first quarter of 1923) who needed a design for a difficult piece of work. The acquaintanceship grew into affection, and eventually to marriage. The couple were married at St. Marylebone in London on 24 April 1865. The 1911 census shows that the marriage was without issue.

While working at the embroiderers Pinwell attended night school at St. Martin&#x27;s Lane Academy. After his mother&#x27;s remarriage in 1861 removed the need for him to work, he became a full time pupil at the Academy, and in 1862 he moved on to Heatherley&#x27;s Academy. In the following year he was drawing on wood blocks for the Dalziel Brothers.

The 1871 census shows his profession as an artist in watercolours, residing at 52 Adeliaid Road in Hampstead. In 1874 Pinwell fell seriously ill and went to North Africa for the winter and spent eight months there. He returned to London in the spring of 1875. He died of consumption on 8 September 1875 at 86 Adelaide Road, Haverstock, South Hampstead, London. His estate was valued at less than £800 and his wife was the executrix.

He was buried on 11 September 1875 on the western side of Highgate Cemetery. His two brothers, and two brothers-in-law, Alfred and Thomas Stevens, attended the funeral. His grave (plot no.20882) has no headstone or visible memorial.

His professional friends came together after his death to raise a fund for the benefit of the widow. Many of his studies and sketches were made public after his death. A posthumous exhibition of his works was held in February to March at M. Deschamp&#x27;s Gallery at 168 New Bond Street. After the exhibition, any works that were not private property were to be sold at Christie&#x27;s for the benefit of the widow.

George C. Williamson wrote a biography of Pinwell in 1900. However, Reid states that this was undertaken largely for the satisfaction of Pinwell&#x27;s widow, and that &quot;its main purpose seems to be to persuade us that Pinwell could hold his own in the most refined society&quot; and to counter &quot;contemporary allegations concerning his sobriety and his grammar.&quot;

==Work==
Williamson states that Pinwell&#x27;s his first drawing appeared in &quot;Lilliput Levee&quot; in 1862, a book of rhymes for children by Matthew Browne(a pseudonym used by William Brighty Rands)

He executed several designs for the silversmiths Elkington&#x27;s. He worked for Josiah Wood Whymper, not as a regular apprentice, but in an informal arrangement. At Whymper&#x27;s Pinwell met J W North an apprentice of Whymper.

Pinwell belonged to the small group of watercolour painters which included Frederick Walker and Arthur Boyd Houghton, whose style came from drawing on wood for book-illustration. Pinwell, Walker, and Houghton, three young men &quot;who did so much for wood engraving in the sixties&quot; all died in 1875 within seven months of each other. Reid notes that there is a legend that Pinwell and Walker were friends, but in reality, this was not so. Walker only once visited Pinwell&#x27;s house, in 1873, and he had already left Whymper when Pinwell started there. Roget notes the many similarities between the lives of Pinwell and Walker: both died early in their careers, Pinwell was two and a half years younger than Walker, and survived him by only three months, both were partially educated at Heatherley&#x27;s Academy, both began their profession as draughtsmen on wood, and in some cases worked on the same books, both died from consumption after attempting to stem it with a winter in Africa, they shared a common style, and shared common subjects, and had posthumous exhibitions at M. Deschamp&#x27;s gallery in London after their deaths.

Together with Walker, another pupil of Whymper, and North, Pinwell was a member of a group known as the &quot;Idyllic School&quot; or the &quot;Idealists&quot; of which Walker is seen as the leader. The name seems to come from the book &quot;Idyllic Pictures&quot;, an anthology of illustrations from &quot;The Quiver&quot;, printed from the original wood blocks, each accompanied by a poem, many of which were published for the first time. &quot;A Round of Days&quot; (George Routledge and Sons, London, 1866) also consisted of poems with individual illustrations, is &quot;sometimes considered archetypally Idyllic in spirit&quot;, and as it contains work by Walker and North as well as Pinwell and Houghton, is probably more representative of the school. Gleeson White described it as &quot;one of the finest of the illustrated gift books&quot;.

The following five illustrations were Pinwell&#x27;s contribution to &quot;A Round of Days&quot;. The Dalziel Brothers described the title as having been &quot;chosen to designate a collection of Poems and Pictures representing every-day scenes, occurrences, and incidents in various phases of assistance.&quot; Each poem has at least one accompanying illustration. In some cases the artist had illustrated the poem, in others the poet has tried to portray in words the ideas in an illustration.

Pinwell&#x27;s best Watercolours were probably the three paintings he submitted for membership of the Royal Watercolour Society were &quot;A Seat in the Park&quot; and two scenes from the Pied Piper of Hamelin, &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamlin&quot; (rats) and &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamlin&quot; (children). Other well regarded pictures were &quot;The Elixir of Love&quot;, &quot;The Troth of Gilbert Becket, the Saracen Maiden&quot; the legendary mother of Thomas Becket, &quot;Out of Town&quot;, and &quot;Landlord and Tenant&quot;.

He painted three major watercolours at Tangier, which were among his last works exhibited at the Royal Watercolour Society in 1875. However, &quot;The Graphic&quot; considered that, although full of interest, the Tangier pictures showed signs &quot;of failing power&quot;. Pinwell contributed watercolours to the Dudley Gallery from 1865 onwards, and in 1869 was elected associate of the Royal Watercolour Society and then full member in 1871. In all, he exhibited fifty-nine works at the Royal Watercolour Society.

Cundall states that Pinwell made many small watercolours &quot;of subjects which he had already produced in black-and-white&quot;. His first exhibited watercolour, &quot;An Incident in the Life of Oliver Goldsmith&quot;, shown in the Dudley Gallery in 1865, was based on the themes and imagery he had used for &quot;Dalziel&#x27;s Illustrated Goldsmith&quot;. In the following example the black-and-white engraving was prepared from the watercolour. Note that the engraving Joseph Swain is reversed from the watercolour, a normal feature of engravings as the final print is a mirror image of the engraving. The engraving was cropped before printing it in &quot;Once a Week&quot; on 26 June 1869. It also suffers from being marked with a partial impression of the text from the following page. This was the only illustration by Pinwell appearing in that volume of the magazine. The watercolour was one of the three paintings submitted by Pinwell for membership of the Water Colour Society. &quot;The Globe&quot; stated that the watercolour was &quot;dramatic in feeling&quot; and showed &quot;the most accurate perception of individual character.&quot; &quot;The Graphic&quot; described the work as &quot;a scene of every-day observation ,yet most pathetically rendered. At one end of the bench a street musician and her child are counting their scanty gains, at the other end a soldier flirts with a nurse, while between the two sits such a specimen of shabby gentility as would have assuredly won Thackeray&#x27;s heart.&quot;

Pinwell most significant book illustration work was probably the Dalziel Brothers&#x27; &quot;Illustrated Goldsmith&quot;. Pinwell drew 100 illustrations for the book over a period of six months. The book was published both in weekly and monthly parts and as a single volume by Ward and Lock. The first part was launched in the same week as Cassell&#x27;s illustrated Goldsmith and led to bitter recriminations between the publishers, with Cassell&#x27;s accusing Ward and Lock of having copied their idea, and of thrusting an inferior product on the public. However, Liveing states that Pinwell was a better black-and-white artist than Henry Anelay (1817-1883), who illustrated Cassell&#x27;s version. Both versions were issued in weekly parts at a cost of one penny, with a monthly part at fourpence or fivepence (Cassell) or sixpence (Dalziel).

Pinwell also illustrated several other books which were engraved by the Dalziels&#x27; including Jean Ingelow&#x27;s poems, Robert Buchanan&#x27;s &quot;Ballads of the Affections&quot;, and the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;.
Pinwell&#x27;s first magazine illustration was for a poem by George Walter Thornbury called &quot;The Saturnalia&quot;, which appeared in volume eight of &quot;Once a Week&quot; on 31 January 1863. Gleeson White calls the illustration &quot;a powerful but entirely untypical illustration of a classical subject by an artist who is best known for pastoral and bucolic scenes&quot;. Reid notes that the subject is &quot;utterly remote&quot; from the kind of subject that Pinwell would himself have chosen. From that time his work was in constant demand. Pinwell illustrated for a range of magazines including:
*&quot;The Argosy&quot;
*&quot;Cassell&#x27;s Family Magazine&quot;
*&quot;Churchman&#x27;s Family Magazine&quot;
*&quot;Fun&quot;
*&quot;Good Words&quot;
*&quot;Judy, or the London Serio-Comic Journal&quot;
*&quot;London Society&quot;
*&quot;Once a Week&quot;
*&quot;Punch&quot;
*&quot;Sunday at Home&quot;
*&quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot;
*&quot;The Leisure Hour&quot;
*&quot;The Quiver&quot;
*&quot;The Sunday Magazine&quot;

==Assessment==

&quot;Modern Book Illustrators&quot; stated that the charm of Pinwell&#x27;s work was &quot;its vivid pictorial truth to life, its dramatic feeling.&quot; The &quot;Dictionary of Victorian Painters&quot; cites Hardie as saying that Pinwell could be set beside Charles Keene &quot;as one of the greatest of British draughtsmen&quot; Cundall notes that Pinwell &quot;executed many small water-colour paintings with a peculiar charm&quot; and that much of Pinwell&#x27;s work &quot;has refined feeling, but it often displays imperfections in execution.&quot; Houfe calls Pinwell &quot;A brilliant colourist&quot;.

Reid states that the work of an artist like Pinwell is always liable to over or under estimation. His art was &quot;hampered constantly by imperfect technique&quot; but that &quot;its very failures are more interesting than the successes of cleverer draughtsmen.&quot; In comparison to Fred Walker, Reid states that Pinwell &quot;had a decorative sense far superior to Walker&#x27;s&quot; and that Pinwell &quot;had a wider range, is infinitely more imaginative, and his work, above all, has a subjective, a lyrical quality&quot;. &quot;The Graphic&quot; stated that Pinwell &quot;did too much to do all things well, and, on the whole, although his originality and ability were beyond question, he never did quite justice to the genuine powers he possessed.&quot; &quot;The Globe&quot; noted that &quot;It is significant of the fine quality of Pinwell&#x27;s art that many of his works are the property of artists.&quot;

<text>ARA &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was an Argentine that was lost during the Falklands War. Built by the US during the Second World War, the ship operated in the United States Navy as USS &quot;Catfish&quot; (SS-339) until 1971 when she was transferred to the Argentine Navy. She served until 1982 when she was captured by the British at South Georgia after being seriously damaged and subsequently sank along a pier, with just her conning tower (sail) visible above the waterline. The submarine was raised, towed out of the bay and scuttled in deep water in 1985.

==U.S. Navy service==
&quot;Catfish&quot; was launched 19 November 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. J. J. Crowley; and commissioned 19 March 1945.

&quot;Catfish&quot; sailed from New London 4 May 1945 for Pearl Harbor, arriving 29 June. After training and the installation of new equipment, she proceeded to Guam for special training, then departed 8 August on her first war patrol, a special mission to locate a minefield off Kyūshū. When the cease-fire order was given 15 August, she was ordered to the Yellow Sea for surface patrol and lifeguard duty. She returned to Guam 4 September, thence to the West Coast, arriving at Seattle 29 September.

Based at San Diego, &quot;Catfish&quot; operated locally on the west coast and made two cruises to the Far East during which she conducted simulated war patrols and provided services to the Seventh Fleet.

&quot;Catfish&quot; was extensively modernized in a GUPPY II conversion (August 1948–May 1949), giving her greater submerged speed and endurance. She was on another Far Eastern cruise when war broke out in Korea, already in the area, she made a reconnaissance patrol in support of the United Nations forces. &quot;Catfish&quot; returned to the States 20 October 1950 and was based in San Diego.

After that the submarine carried out training exercises with the Naval Reserve off the west coast, operated with the Canadian Forces in joint antisubmarine warfare exercises, and made several cruises to the Far East.

&quot;Catfish&quot; was decommissioned and transferred to the Argentine Navy on 1 July 1971.

==Argentine service==

&quot;Catfish&quot; was renamed ARA &quot;Santa Fe&quot; (S-21), after she was acquired by Argentina in 1971, along with her sister ship USS &quot;Chivo&quot; (SS-341) which was renamed ARA &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot; (S-22), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class GUPPY 1A submarine.

===Chile conflict===
In the 1978 conflict between Argentina and Chile, the Argentine Submarine Force deployed all four submarines, including &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot;, which made several patrols in the conflict area. Peace was achieved on 21 December, in part due to the visit of the Pope and the diplomatic intervention of both countries, and war was avoided. All Argentine ships returned to port without any incident.

===Falklands War===
In 1982, the ship&#x27;s commander was Captain Horacio Bicain. In March 1982, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; participated in an exercise called Cimarron, together with the Uruguayan Navy. Her sister ship, &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot;, was no longer in operation. She took part in the Falklands War (2 April–14 June 1982) alongside &quot;San Luis&quot;, a German Type 209, which was the other operational Argentine submarine.

&quot;Santa Fe&quot; supported the landings on 2 April as part of Operation Rosario, transporting divers from the Agrupacion de Buzos Tacticos to Playa Roja - Yorke Bay - and marking the beach for the main amphibious force, completing this objective at 3am; the main assault at Playa Roja began at 6.30am. As part of Operation Rosario, the ARA &quot;Santa Fe&quot; divers also seized the lighthouse at Cape Pembroke. Once the mission was complete, the submarine returned to Argentina, arriving on 7 April.

On 12 April, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was ordered to ferry a party of Argentine marines and supplies to Grytviken, in South Georgia. The island of South Georgia is situated 784 NM southeast of Falklands, 1,300 NM east of South America, 2,600 NM west of Africa and 720 NM north of Antarctica. Santa Fe departed from Mar del Plata in the early hours of 16 April, being armed with WWII-vintage Mk 14 and Cold War Mk 37 torpedoes, and also carrying supplies for the Argentine garrison that had been in the island since 3 April. On 24 April, the submarine reached the island and began unloading supplies. Members of the Argentine garrison had salvaged a crippled BAS launch, which was used to unload the cargo. Among other supplies were Bantam anti-tank missiles and a recoilless rifle; heavy equipment that had to be maneuvered through the hatch by hand, and then to the small boat, which carried out three trips ferrying troops and supplies. This part of the mission ended at 5:44am on 25 April, and then &quot;Santa Fe&quot; quickly departed, trying to reach ocean depth deep enough to safely submerge.

====Fatal attack====

On 23 April, the Royal Navy ships , , and the ice patrol ship had been sent to retake the island of South Georgia, with a detachment of Royal Marines and Special Boat Squadron commandos. This was Operation Paraquet. Around 6am on 25 April, after leaving Grytviken, &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was detected on radar by Lieutenant Chris Parry, the observer of the Westland Wessex HAS.3 anti-submarine helicopter from &quot;Antrim&quot;, and attacked with depth charges. This attack caused extensive internal damage, including the splitting of a ballast tank, the dismounting of electrical components and shocks to the machinery. As the submarine struggled to return to Grytviken on the surface, &quot;Plymouth&quot; launched a Westland Wasp HAS.1 helicopter, and &quot;Brilliant&quot; launched a Westland Lynx HAS.2. The Lynx dropped a Mk 46 torpedo, which failed to strike home, but strafed the submarine with its pintle-mounted 7.62 mm L7 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG). The Wessex also fired on &quot;Santa Fe&quot; with its GPMG. The Wasp from HMS &quot;Plymouth&quot; and two other Wasps launched from &quot;Endurance&quot; fired AS-12 air-to-surface anti-ship missiles at the submarine. Due to the fiberglass material of the ship&#x27;s sail, the missiles passed from side to side. Corporal Alberto Macias was severely wounded, later having a leg amputated. Machine gun fire was used to respond to the attack from the ship as it retreated back to Grytviken. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was fitted with doors at the sail, from which to shoot while navigating on the surface. It was a feature that most American submariners considered unnecessary, as it was unlikely to be used in modern warfare.

Once ashore, &quot;Santa Fe&quot;″s crew and the Argentine garrison at South Georgia, still under attack, attempted to fire their rifles and machine guns and a &quot;Bantam&quot; anti-tank missile at the aircraft, which missed. The Argentine boat was damaged badly enough to prevent her from navigating. The British aircraft decided to end the attack and retreat to their ships. The crew abandoned the listing submarine at Grytviken pier. At 5pm on 25 April the Grytviken garrison commander surrendered, after being warned by the main guns of the ships HMS &quot;Plymouth&quot; (F-126) and HMS &quot;Antrim&quot; (D-18); there were also several helicopters in the area, transporting SAS and SBS commandos to strategic points. Lt. Alfredo Astiz and fifteen of his men, at Port Leith, initially refused to surrender on April 25, but did so on the morning of 26 April.

====Reclamation and disposal====
A Royal Navy officer told the Santa Fe&#x27;s captain, Cpt. Horacio Bicain, that they would have to work together to move the submarine from the main pier in Grytviken to a whaler quay, about 2,000 yards away. To accomplish the move, a reduced crew was assigned, Cpt. Bicain being one of them. The British assigned some guards. While under guard on the submarine by a British Royal Marine, Argentine Navy Petty Officer Felix Artuso was mistakenly shot dead on 26 April while a prisoner of war. His body was buried at Grytviken Cemetery. Artuso was shot because it was believed that he was trying to sabotage the vessel. According to some members of her crew, in the middle of the confusion that followed the incident, a number of valves and hatchways were left open, the submarine flooded and sank alongside the pier, with only her combat-damaged conning tower showing above the surface. Artuso is the only Argentine buried in the Georgias, and the only Argentine submariner who died in a war.

Before the conflict ended on 14 June, the crew of ARA &quot;Santa Fe&quot; had been taken as POWs to Ascension Island, from where a Red Cross-chartered airliner flew them to Uruguay. The half-sunken submarine remained in Grytviken. During June 1982, tugs dragged it to a shallow inlet called Moraine Fjord, with part of the sail still visible. The submarine was considered to be worthless as a war prize because she was non-standard, obsolete, badly damaged and too expensive to repair. In 1983, a first attempt to dispose of the ship was made, but a storm came on and it sank completely in slightly deeper water, where it remained for over a year. However, the submarine was still loaded with torpedoes, there was oil leaking from it, acidic electrolyte in the batteries, and lead-based paint flaking off. As a result, in 1985, the British Ministry of Defence arranged the final disposal of the ship, Operation Okehampton. This costly operation involved the specialist ship MV &quot;Salvageman&quot; and the government-owned ship RMAS &quot;Goosander&quot;, divers and special equipment in order to lift the submarine to the surface. The submarine was temporarily raised on 11 February, the contaminating elements were removed over a period of eight days, and the submarine was towed into deep water and scuttled north of South Georgia, about 5 miles out, on 20 February 1985.

<text>Jean Ingelow (17 March 1820 – 20 July 1897) was an English poet and novelist, who gained sudden fame in 1863. She also wrote several stories for children.

==Early life==
Born in Boston, Lincolnshire on 17 March 1820, Jean Ingelow was the daughter of William Ingelow, a banker. The family moved to Ipswich when she was 14. Her father was manager of the Ipswich and Suffolk Banking Company, and the family lived in accommodation above the bank at 2 Elm Street. After the bank failed, her family moved out and an arch was built leading to Arcade Street. A blue plaque commemorating her has been installed and nearby Ingelow Street is named after her. A younger brother was the architect Benjamin Ingelow.

Using the pseudonym Oris, Jean Ingelow contributed verses and tales to magazines as a girl, but her first volume, &quot;A Rhyming Chronicle of Incidents and Feelings&quot;, only appeared anonymously with an established London publisher when she was in her 30th year. This was described as charming by Alfred Tennyson, who said he would like to know the author. They later became friends.

==Professional life==
Ingelow followed this in 1851 with a story, &quot;Allerton and Dreux&quot;, but it was the publication of her &quot;Poems&quot; in 1863 that suddenly made her popular. It ran rapidly through numerous editions and was set to music, proving popular as domestic entertainment. The collection was said to have sold 200,000 copies. Her writings often focus on religious introspection. In 1867 she edited, with Dora Greenwell, &quot;A Story of Doom and other Poems&quot;, a poetry collection for children.

Ingelow&#x27;s work also gained public acclaim in the United States. 

At that point, Ingelow gave up verse for a while and became industrious as a novelist. &quot;Off the Skelligs&quot; appeared in 1872, &quot;Fated to be Free&quot; in 1873, &quot;Sarah de Berenger&quot; in 1880, and &quot;John Jerome&quot; in 1886. She also wrote &quot;Studies for Stories&quot; (1864), &quot;Stories told to a Child&quot; (1865), &quot;Mopsa the Fairy&quot; (1869), and other stories for children, which were influenced by Lewis Carroll and George MacDonald. &quot;Mopsa the Fairy&quot;, about a boy who discovers a nest of fairies and discovers a fairyland while riding on the back of an albatross, was one of her most popular works (reprinted in 1927 with illustrations by Dorothy P. Lathrop). Anne Thaxter Eaton, writing in &quot;A Critical History of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;, calls it &quot;a well-constructed tale&quot; with &quot;charm and a kind of logical make-believe.&quot; Her third series of &quot;Poems&quot; was published in 1885.

Jean Ingelow&#x27;s last years were spent in Kensington. By then she had outlived her popularity as a poet. She died in 1897 and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

==Criticism==

Ingelow&#x27;s poems, collected in one volume in 1898, had frequently been popular successes. &quot;Sailing beyond Seas&quot; and &quot;When Sparrows build in Supper at the Mill&quot; were among the most popular songs of the day. Her best-known poems include &quot;The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire, 1571&quot; and &quot;Divided&quot;.

Many of her contemporaries defended her work. Gerald Massey described &quot;The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire&quot; as &quot;a poem full of power and tenderness&quot;. Susan Coolidge remarked in a preface to an anthology of Ingelow&#x27;s poems, &quot;She stood amid the morning dew/And sang her earliest measure sweet/Sang as the lark sings, speeding fair/to touch and taste the purer air.&quot; &quot;Sailing beyond Seas&quot; (or &quot;The Dove on the Mast&quot;) was a favourite poem of Agatha Christie, who quoted it in two novels, &quot;The Moving Finger&quot; and &quot;Ordeal by Innocence&quot;. American composer Emily Bruce Roelofson used Ingelow’s text for her song “I Leaned Out of Windows”.

Yet the wider literary world largely dismissed her. &quot;The Cambridge History of English and American Literature&quot;, for example, wrote: &quot;If we had nothing of Jean Ingelow’s but the most remarkable poem entitled Divided, it would be permissible to suppose the loss [of her], in fact or in might-have-been, of a poetess of almost the highest rank... Jean Ingelow wrote some other good things, but nothing at all equalling this; while she also wrote too much and too long.&quot; Some of this criticism has overtones of dismissing her as a female writer: &quot;Unless a man is an extraordinary coxcomb, a person of private means, or both, he seldom has the time and opportunity of committing, or the wish to commit, bad or indifferent verse for a long series of years; but it is otherwise with woman.&quot;

There have been many parodies of her poetry, noting her archaisms, flowery language and perceived sentimentality. These include &quot;Lovers, and a Reflexion&quot; by Charles Stuart Calverley and &quot;Supper at the Kind Brown Mill&quot;, a parody of her &quot;Supper at the Mill&quot;, which appears in Gilbert Sorrentino&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;Blue Pastoral&quot; (1983).

*&quot;Mopsa the Fairy&quot; at A Celebration of Women Writers
*A Lost Wand
*The Prince&#x27;s Dream
*Gems From Jean Ingelow

==Legacy==
Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s short story &quot;My Son&#x27;s Wife&quot; refers to &quot;The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire, 1571&quot;. A reading of the same poem forms a scene in chapter 7 of D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;. 

The novelist Maureen Peters wrote &quot;Jean Ingelow: Victorian Poetess&quot; (1972).

The city of Enderby, British Columbia, in Canada was named in 1887 after a reading of &quot;The High Tide on the Coast of Lincolnshire, 1571&quot;, and Ingelow, Manitoba, is named for her. There is an Ingelow Road in Battersea, London.

<text>Tengku Ampuan Tua Tengku Intan Zaharah binti Almarhum Tengku Seri Setia Raja Tengku Hitam Omar (Jawi: ; 13 April 1928 – 24 January 2015) was the Tengku Ampuan Tua (Grand Queen Dowager) of Terengganu. She was formerly the Tengku Ampuan Besar (Queen consort) of Terengganu from 1945 to 1979, the Tengku Ampuan (Queen Dowager) of Terengganu from 1979 to 1998 and Tengku Ampuan Tua (Grand Queen Dowager) of Terengganu from 1998 until her death in 2015. She also served as the fourth Raja Permaisuri Agong of Malaysia from 1965 to 1970.

==Early life==
Tengku Intan was born in Singapore on 13 April 1928. Her father, Tengku Seri Setia Raja Terengganu Tengku Hitam Omar, was a member of the Singapore (Johor Bendahara Horeh) royal family, serving in the Terengganu State Civil Service as the State Secretary of Terengganu; he was exiled since the death of the last Sultan of Singapore, Alauddin Alam Shah, in 1897. Her mother was Raja Zainab binti Raja Alang (second wife of her father).

Tengku Intan received her education at the Malay School in Telok Kurau and Katong Convent, Singapore.

==Royal life==
Tengku Intan married Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Zainal Abidin III (then Tengku Paduka Raja of Terengganu) on 3 April 1944 as his second wife. She had no children with him.

On 5 November 1945 the Terengganu State Council of thirteen members announced the dismissal of Sultan Ali Shah and the appointment of Tengku Ismail as the fifteenth Sultan of Terengganu. Tengku Ismail became known as Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah and was installed on 6 June 1949 at Istana Maziah, Kuala Terengganu.

Accordingly, Tengku Intan Zaharah became Tengku Ampuan Besar (Queen) of Terengganu. Tengku Intan served as Raja Permaisuri Agong during her husband&#x27;s reign as the fourth Yang di-Pertuan Agong or King of Malaysia.

In 1979, upon her husband&#x27;s death she was created Tengku Ampuan (Queen Dowager) of Terengganu. In 1998, on the death of her stepson, Sultan Mahmud Al-Muktafi Billah Shah, she became Tengku Ampuan Tua (Grand Queen Dowager) of Terengganu.

==Death==
Tengku Ampuan Tua Tengku Intan Zaharah died on 24 January 2015 at 3:30 pm in Hospital Pantai, Kuala Lumpur due to pneumonia. She was 86 years old. Her body was brought back to Terengganu and was laid to rest beside her husband’s grave, Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah at the Royal Mausoleum near Abidin Mosque, Kuala Terengganu.

<text>Falkirk Football Club is a Scottish professional association football club based in the town of Falkirk. The club was founded in 1876 and competes in the Scottish Championship, the second tier of Scottish football, as a member of the Scottish Professional Football League. The club was elected to the Second Division of the Scottish Football League in 1902–03, was promoted to the First Division after two seasons and achieved its highest league position in the early 1900s when it was runner-up to Celtic in 1907–08 and 1909–10. The football club was registered as a Limited Liability Company in April 1905 – Falkirk Football &amp; Athletic Club Ltd.

Falkirk won the Scottish Cup for the first time in 1913. After 1945, Falkirk were promoted and demoted between the Premier and First Divisions seven times until 1995–96, and during the 1970s spent three seasons in the Second Division. In 2005, Falkirk were promoted to the Scottish Premier League (SPL). Falkirk won the Scottish Cup again in 1957 and were runners-up in the competition in 1997, 2009 and 2015. As a result of their performance in the 2009 Scottish Cup, the club qualified for the inaugural season of the UEFA Europa League in 2009–10. Falkirk have won the second tier of Scottish football a record seven times, an honour shared with St Johnstone. They have also won the Scottish Challenge Cup more than any other club, winning it for the fourth time in 2012.

In their early years, Falkirk played at three venues: Hope Street, Randyford Park and Blinkbonny Park. Between 1885 and 2003, the club was based at Brockville Park, built on the former Hope Street ground. After the creation of the SPL in 1998, its strict stadium criteria – to which Brockville Park did not conform – was enforced, and the club was denied promotion on three occasions. The club&#x27;s present home ground since 2004 is the Falkirk Stadium, a all-seater stadium on the outskirts of Falkirk.

== History ==
=== Club formation and early years ===
The club&#x27;s date of formation is uncertain. Although some accounts point to the year 1876, others claim it was formed in 1877. However, the former is the date used by the club and its fans. In 1878, the club joined the Scottish Football Association, and became eligible to compete in the Scottish Cup, a knockout tournament which became the country&#x27;s main association football cup competition. The club reached the second round in the first year that it competed. In the first few years after it was formed, Falkirk played mostly friendly games. They played their home matches at three different grounds during this period; Hope Street, Randyford Park and Blinkbonny Park. It left the latter in 1884 and moved to Brockville Park, which remained the club&#x27;s home ground for 118 years. The Stirlingshire Football Association was founded in 1883, which invited clubs from the Stirlingshire region to join. It resulted in the establishment of a new tournament, the Stirlingshire Cup, a competition open exclusively to the teams from the region, which Falkirk won in its inaugural season. The club&#x27;s nickname is &quot;The Bairns&quot;, a Scots word meaning sons or daughters, which is given to natives of the town of Falkirk. This is reflected in the Falkirk Burgh motto: &quot;Better meddle wi&#x27; the de&#x27;il than the Bairns o&#x27; Fa&#x27;kirk&quot;.

=== Election to the Football League ===
After playing mostly regional matches, friendly games and the nationwide Scottish Cup tournament for the majority of its existence, the club was elected to the bottom tier of the Scottish Football League in 1902–03, a national sports league consisting of Scotland&#x27;s top football clubs. At the time, the league consisted of two tiers, the First and Second Divisions. Falkirk was promoted to the top division with a second-place finish behind Clyde after two seasons. Despite the club&#x27;s success, several months beforehand a proposal to merge with local rivals East Stirlingshire was raised, which was narrowly rejected in a vote. In 1907–08, Falkirk&#x27;s third season in the top flight, the club finished the season in second place, its highest league position to date, and repeated this in the 1909–10 season. On both occasions it finished behind champions Celtic despite being the top goal scorers in the league, becoming the first Scottish club to break the 100 goals barrier in a single season. In 1913, the club won the Scottish Cup for the first time, defeating Raith Rovers in the final 2–0.

In 1922, the club broke the world record transfer fee, paying £5000 for the transfer of striker Syd Puddefoot from English club West Ham United. The following year, the club played against the Scottish Football League XI to raise funds for those affected by the Redding mine disaster.

Falkirk spent 30 consecutive seasons in their first spell in the top flight of Scottish football, before being relegated in 1934–35 after finishing 20th at the bottom of the league. Despite this, the club was promoted to the top flight after one season, as champions of the 1935–36 Second Division, amassing a club record of 132 league goals in the process. Falkirk remained in the top flight until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, when the league was suspended.

=== Post-war promotion and demotion ===
After the war ended in 1945, the Scottish Football League resumed and Falkirk regained its place in the First Division for the 1946–47 season. In 1947, a new competition, the Scottish League Cup, was inaugurated. In the 1947–48 season, Falkirk reached the final, and lost 4–1 to East Fife in the replayed final after an initial 0–0 draw.

The club competed in the final of the Scottish Cup in 1957. They defeated Kilmarnock in a replay. This was their first success in the tournament since winning it 44 years earlier. In June 1958 Alex Parker and Eddie O&#x27;Hara from the cup winning side were bought by Everton for a combined fee or £18,000. John White was signed two months later from Alloa Athletic with £3,300 of that money.

In the years to follow, relegation and promotion between the first and second tiers occurred seven times until the 1995–96 season. The club spent eight consecutive seasons at a time in either division. As a result, Falkirk has won or finished runners-up in the second tier of Scottish football a record 14 times, the majority occurring in this period. The club also spent three seasons in the late 1970s in the newly created third tier, the lowest tier it has competed in. In 1977–78 the club finished in its lowest ranking to date, ending the season in the equivalent of 29th in Scotland following a 5th-place finish in the new Second Division. In the 1996–97 season, the club reached the final of the Scottish Cup for the third time, and Falkirk became the seventh club in 106 years to reach the final whilst competing outside the top league of Scottish football. Falkirk&#x27;s opponents were Kilmarnock, a repeat of the 1957 final, but the club could not match its 1957 success and lost 1–0.

=== Scottish Premier League ===
The Scottish Premier League (SPL) was founded in 1998 as the new top flight of Scottish football. The new league and its rules denied Falkirk the chance to be promoted into it on three occasions as a consequence of its formation. When the SPL was created from the old Premier Division, a play-off match that was held between the team ranked ninth in the Premier Division and the team ranked second in the First Division was abolished during the 1997–98 season. Falkirk, ranked second in the First Division, was thus denied a play-off with Motherwell. The SPL&#x27;s criterion that clubs required a 10,000 capacity all-seater stadium in order to compete in the new league, which Falkirk&#x27;s Brockville Park did not comply with, was introduced. When the SPL was due to expand to 12 teams at the end of the 1999–2000 season, Aberdeen, which finished bottom of the SPL, would have competed in a three-way play-off against the teams that finished second and third in the First Division, and two of these three clubs would gain SPL status for the next season. Brockville Park was still below the SPL criterion, and Falkirk applied to ground-share Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, but the proposal was rejected. The play-off was abandoned, Dunfermline Athletic was automatically promoted and Aberdeen retained its status in the top flight.

Following four successive top three finishes in the First Division since 1997–98, the club&#x27;s fortunes changed dramatically and it finished the season in ninth position, which would have qualified the club to be relegated to the third tier. However, it was spared relegation by the liquidation of fellow First Division club Airdrieonians on the last day of the season. The following season, Falkirk was again denied promotion to the SPL despite finishing top of the First Division. The club submitted another application to ground-share, this time at New Broomfield – an SPL compliant stadium and the home of Airdrie United – but was rejected in a vote by SPL chairmen. Motherwell was thus spared relegation from the First Division. In order to meet the criterion, Falkirk started building a new stadium and left Brockville Park.

During the 2004–05 season, the SPL stadium criterion was reduced to 6,000, which the club&#x27;s new Falkirk Stadium met. The club won the First Division that season, winning 1–0 to Ross County, and was promoted to the SPL. After three seasons in the SPL, including two seventh-place finishes, the club qualified for the inaugural season of the UEFA Europa League, the first time the club qualified for a European competition. The same year, Falkirk was beaten by Rangers in the final of the Scottish Cup. Despite its cup success, Falkirk finished in 10th place in the league and avoided relegation with a 1–0 win against Inverness Caledonian Thistle. The following season, the club competed in the Europa League but was relegated from the SPL to the First Division after being held to a 0–0 draw against Kilmarnock on the final day of the 2009–10 season.

=== Scottish First Division/Scottish Championship ===
Following its return to the First Division, Falkirk finished the 2010–11 and 2011–12 seasons in third position. As members of the Scottish Football League, the club was eligible to compete in the Scottish Challenge Cup, which it won 1-0 against Hamilton Academical in 2012 to win the cup for a record fourth time. In the same year Falkirk reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, but lost to Celtic. The club had defeated the reigning SPL champions Rangers 3–2 in the third round, and also defeated another top flight club Dundee United on penalties in the quarter-finals.

In 2012-13 Falkirk finished a distant third in the league, 25 points behind champions Partick Thistle, but had a great run in the Scottish Cup, beating local rivals Stenhousemuir as well as Hamilton Academical en route to the semi-final against Hibernian at Hampden Park. Falkirk, under the management of Gary Holt for the first time, took a 3–0 half time lead, though Hibernian made a comeback to confirm their place in the final with a 4–3 win (AET). Gary Holt left the managers post in June 2014 to join Norwich on their coaching team. He was replaced by Peter Houston. In the 2013–14 season Falkirk finished third in the Scottish Championship, narrowly missing out on the title by 3 points having still been in with a chance on the final day of the season. They qualified for the Premiership play-off, where they defeated Queen of the South 4–3 on aggregate (AET) in the quarter-final, before losing to Hamilton Academical 2–1 on aggregate in the semis.

In 2014–15, Falkirk missed out on the play-off places, finishing in 5th place in the championship, Falkirk went one better in the Scottish Cup than two years previously, reaching the final, avenging their loss to Hibernian in the semi-finals before being defeated by Inverness 2–1 in the final. In 2015–16 Falkirk finished second in the Championship and qualified for the promotion play-offs. They defeated Hibernian 5–4 on aggregate in the semi-final before facing Kilmarnock. A 1–0 home win in the first leg put Falkirk on the verge of a return to top flight football. However, Kilmarnock won 4–0 in the second leg to retain their place in the Scottish Premiership 4–1 on aggregate.

The following season, Falkirk again finished second in the league and qualified for the play-offs. They went out to Dundee United 4–3 on aggregate in the semi-finals. Falkirk started the 2017–18 season very badly and the club found themselves in danger of relegation to League One. Manager Peter Houston was sacked in September 2017 following a 2–0 home loss to Livingston, which left the club second bottom of the league. Paul Hartley replaced him as manager. Hartley only won one of his first nine league games, and the club still sat in second bottom, 8 points from guaranteed safety at Christmas. A run of three wins in five games caused Falkirk to draw level on points with third bottom Dumbarton and eventually pull away to finish eighth.

=== Scottish League One ===
Falkirk had a disastrous 2018–19 season which saw the club relegated on the final day, despite running out 3–2 winners against the Champions Ross County. This led to the club&#x27;s second spell in the Scottish third tier. The 2019–20 season was declared early after 28 games played, leaving Falkirk in second place, 1 point behind Raith Rovers.

The 2020–21 season was another to forget for Falkirk fans. After starting the season on form and seeing themselves clear at the top of the table, a collapse in the second half of the season following a mid-season break due to the COVID-19 pandemic saw Falkirk fall to 5th in League One after a 2–0 defeat to Airdrieonians on the final day cost them a spot in the play-offs.

In the 2022–23 season, they finished second, with Dunfermline Athletic winning the league. The Bairns entered the play-offs against Airdrieonians, only to suffer a 7–2 aggregate loss, losing 6–2 in the first leg and 1–0 in the return.

On 30 March 2024, Falkirk were crowned League One champions without kicking a ball after Hamilton failed to win at home to Queen of the South. On 4 May 2024, Falkirk completed the league season undefeated with a record in the 36-game League One season of won 27, drew 9 and lost zero, achieving only the seventh unbeaten league season across the entire history of Scottish football.

=== Return to the Scottish Championship ===
Falkirk&#x27;s unbeaten run finally came to an end on 28 September 2024 when they were beaten 1-0 by Raith Rovers at Stark&#x27;s Park.

== Colours and badge ==

Falkirk&#x27;s traditional colours are navy blue and white, which the team first wore during the 1882 season. However, the club&#x27;s first strip, thin blue and white horizontal hoops on the jersey and socks, was worn between 1876 and 1880. This was replaced with a blue jersey and white shorts, which has featured predominantly since. Touches of red were introduced to the strip in the late 1930s – mostly on the socks – was worn until the early 1960s, re-introduced in the mid-1970s and has since been featured in the team&#x27;s kit. For the 2017–18 season the kit consisted of a navy blue jersey, white shorts and navy socks.

Falkirk&#x27;s current crest is a stylised version of the Falkirk Steeple, a dominant landmark of the town. During the 2007–08 season the club used a crest – known as &quot;The Highlander&quot; – that was worn during the club&#x27;s 1957 Scottish Cup win as a 50th anniversary tribute to the players. Kit manufacturer Umbro supplied the club&#x27;s kit for the 1977–78 season. Other kits have been supplied by Bukta, Patrick and Le Coq Sportif. The current supplier is O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s and the club&#x27;s shirt sponsor is Crunchy Carrots. Recent sponsors include Central Demolition, Budweiser Budvar, John R Weir Mercedes Group and Beazer Homes.

== Stadiums ==

In the club&#x27;s early years, Falkirk played its home games at three different sites: Hope Street, Randyford Park and Blinkbonny Park. The first pitch used by the club was on Hope Street, the location that would become Brockville Park in 1884. The first match at Hope Street was against Grasshoppers from Bonnybridge. After one season, Falkirk moved to Randyford Park, the home of East Stirlingshire Cricket Club during the summer months, in 1878 where the club played its first competitive match, which it won against Campsie Glen of Lennoxtown in the Scottish Cup. The ground was located near Forth Valley College, several hundred yards west of the present Falkirk Stadium. The club played at Blinkbonny Park between 1881 and 1883.
Between 1885 and 2003, Falkirk was based at Brockville Park, which was located a quarter of a mile (0.4 km) from the town centre of Falkirk. Brockville Park was largely terraced and had a capacity of between 7,500 and 8,000 spectators in its later years. On 21 February 1953, Falkirk&#x27;s largest home attendance was recorded at the ground when 23,100 spectators watched the club play against Celtic in the third round of the Scottish Cup.
When the SPL was created in 1998, Brockville Park fell short of the SPL&#x27;s stadium criteria, mainly because of the terraced stands. As a result, the club was denied entry to the league, despite winning the First Division or qualifying for a promotion play-off, on three occasions. Falkirk remained at the stadium until the last day of the 2002–03 football season, and in late 2003 Brockville was demolished and the site sold to supermarket chain Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc. To commemorate the club&#x27;s time at the stadium, the supermarket displays Falkirk F.C. memorabilia, including a turnstile. For the 2003–04 season, Falkirk entered an agreement with Stenhousemuir to ground-share Ochilview Park stadium for one season while the club&#x27;s new stadium was under construction.

Since the beginning of the 2004–05 season, the club has been based at Falkirk Stadium, an 7,937 capacity all-seater stadium built on the eastern outskirts of Falkirk. The stadium was opened in July 2004 with a friendly match against Dundee. When it opened, only the 4,200 capacity west stand was completed. The 2,000 capacity north stand was constructed during the opening season and was completed in May 2005, taking the stadium above the SPL&#x27;s reduced 6,000 seating criterion. Falkirk became champions of the First Division that season and was promoted to the SPL. The stadium has since been further expanded; the south stand officially opened in a match against Royal Antwerp of Belgium in August 2009.

== Supporters and rivalries ==

Falkirk&#x27;s strongest recent rivalry is the Kincardine derby which is contested with Dunfermline Athletic. The city of Dunfermline and Falkirk are roughly 13 miles apart, separated by the River Forth. Both clubs are a similar size and have regularly competed at the same level in the SPL and First Division but the origin of the rivalry is unclear, as former Falkirk manager John Hughes said in an interview in 2005. The two clubs have played important promotion and relegation encounters against each other over the past thirty years which has only increased the animosity between the two sets of fans.

In 2009 the Falkirk Herald recalled Super Tuesday: &quot;More than 20 years ago a previously postponed league fixture took place at Brockville. The then mighty Dunfermline had come to town expecting victory as they looked to continue their push for promotion from the B&amp;Q First Division. But, for over half of the 9200 supporters that packed the terraces on 7 March 1989, little did they know they would witness a match which would eventually become part of Falkirk folklore. Goals from Derek McWilliams, Paul Rutherford, Sammy McGivern and Stuart Burgess without reply brought the Pars back down to earth with an almighty bang.&quot;

A significant match between Falkirk and Dunfermline took place in April 2009, when they met at the semi-final stage of the 2008–09 Scottish Cup at Hampden Park; the &quot;Bairns&quot; won 2–0 in front of over 17,000 fans to progress to the final.

The club&#x27;s traditional rival was East Stirlingshire, a club that was also based in Falkirk. The two teams regularly competed against each other in their early existences in the Stirlingshire Cup, as well as in league football following Falkirk&#x27;s election to the Scottish Football League in 1902–03, two seasons after East Stirlingshire. As of May 2020, the last time the clubs played each other in a competitive league fixture was in April 1982, which East Stirlingshire won 3–0, when both clubs were in the First Division. Following East Stirlingshire&#x27;s relegation that season, the two clubs have not competed in the same league; Falkirk predominantly in the First Division and East Stirlingshire in the Third Division. In 1999–00 the clubs were drawn against each other in the second round of the Scottish League Cup, which Falkirk won 2–0 after extra time was played, the last competitive fixture between the clubs excluding the Stirlingshire Cup.

==Current squad==
===First team===











===On loan===




== Club staff ==
== Managers ==

The club&#x27;s first manager was Willie Nicol, who was appointed in 1905, before which all manager appointments were assigned to the club secretary. Nicol was first appointed club secretary in 1900, then secretary/manager and finally manager. Nicol is the longest serving manager in Falkirk&#x27;s history. Alex Totten, manager from 1996 to 2002 who led the side to the 1997 Scottish Cup Final, was named the clubs lifetime ambassador ahead of his retirement from football in 2021.

This list does not include caretaker managers or those who managed in a temporary capacity.

&quot;Only competitive matches are counted&quot;

== Notable players ==
== European record ==
Since the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) was formed in 1960, Falkirk has qualified for a UEFA club competition on one occasion. In 2009, Falkirk reached the final of the Scottish Cup, which it lost to Rangers. The winner of the Scottish Cup would normally qualify for the UEFA Europa League, but because Rangers had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League through their league ranking in the SPL, the place was passed to Falkirk as runners-up. Falkirk was eliminated in the second qualifying round by FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein in a two-legged tie.&lt;ref name=&quot;FC_Vaduz_09/10&quot;&gt;UEFA Europa League 2009/10 – Matches, &quot;uefa.com&quot;. 13 August 2011. Retrieved 28 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The club&#x27;s only European goal was scored by Ryan Flynn in the 1–0 first leg home victory against FC Vaduz.

<doc id="560091" wikidata="Q725550" url="?curid=560091" title="Keith Floyd">
<text>Keith Floyd (28 December 1943 – 14 September 2009) was a British celebrity cook, restaurateur, television personality and &quot;gastronaut&quot; who hosted cooking shows for the BBC and published many books combining cookery and travel. On television, his eccentric style of presentation – usually drinking wine as he cooked and talking to his crew – endeared him to millions of viewers worldwide.

==Early life==
Floyd was born at Folly Farm, Sulhamstead, near Reading, Berkshire, on 28 December 1943 to Sydney Albert Floyd (1915–1985) and Winifred Phyllis Lorraine, née Margetts. His father, from a working-class background in Solihull, West Midlands, studied electro-engineering at college until the outbreak of the Second World War, when he joined the Royal Corps of Signals; unable to continue his studies, he became (by his son&#x27;s recollection) &quot;a tailor or something of that sort&quot;, then a meter repairman for the electricity board, going on to work at the Fawley oil refinery on Southampton Water. He was also a lay preacher. Floyd was brought up in a council house in the small town of Wiveliscombe in Somerset, where his mother grew up; he referred to his upbringing as &quot;a very happy rural childhood&quot;. His family made financial sacrifices to enable him to be educated privately at Wellington School, Somerset; popular and a good rugby player, he was forced to leave at 16 due to lack of money.

Floyd became a cub reporter on the &quot;Bristol Evening Post&quot;. He claimed, perhaps jokingly, that he decided to join the British Army in 1963 after watching the film &quot;Zulu&quot;, although the film was not released until 1964. Having turned down the 11th Hussars he was commissioned as second lieutenant in the &quot;less snooty&quot; Royal Tank Regiment serving on Centurion tanks, where he pestered the mess cook to produce gourmet dinners.

After three years, finding that he and the Army were &quot;mutually incompatible&quot;, Floyd found employment in several catering-related jobs including barman, dishwasher and vegetable peeler.

==Career==
By 1971 Floyd had acquired three restaurants in Bristol: Floyd&#x27;s Bistro in Princess Victoria Street in Clifton, Floyd&#x27;s Restaurant in Alma Vale Road and Keith Floyd&#x27;s Restaurant in Chandos Road, Redland.
All three restaurants had financial problems. Floyd sold the restaurants and the rights to the name &quot;Floyd&#x27;s Restaurant&quot; and moved to the south of France, where again he opened a restaurant in L&#x27;Isle-sur-la-Sorgue in the Vaucluse. After this again ended in financial problems, he moved back to Britain. With the help of loans from friends, he opened another restaurant, again in Chandos Road.

The restaurant in Chandos Road was frequented by actors and others connected with television. Floyd&#x27;s first cookery book, &quot;Floyd&#x27;s Food&quot;, published before he became a TV celebrity, had an introduction written by Leonard Rossiter, star of British TV sitcoms &quot;Rising Damp&quot; and &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;.

Floyd&#x27;s first foray into the world of show business was as a radio chef on Radio West, an independent commercial radio station in Bristol. TV producer David Pritchard then offered him a slot on BBC West regional magazine show &quot;RPM&quot;, presented by Andy Batten Foster. That led, in 1984, to his being offered his first BBC TV series &quot;Floyd on Fish&quot;, which started his rapid rise to national popularity. Floyd never described himself as a chef since he was untrained.

He became well known for cooking with a glass of wine in one hand, often in unusual locations such as a fishing boat in rough seas. He was regarded as a pioneer of taking cooking programmes out of the studio. The chef went on to present his shows from around the world, cooking on location in his unique chaotic style.

He bought and ran the Maltsters Arms in Tuckenhay, Devon in the late 1980s. When Floyd was not running the kitchen, chefs included Jean-Christophe Novelli. He was more often seen at the bar than in the kitchen. The failure of the Maltsters led to his bankruptcy.

Despite TV success, Floyd continued to have financial problems and personal conflicts. He was declared bankrupt in 1996. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; claims that this happened after he personally guaranteed an order for £36,000 of drinks. He lived in Kinsale, County Cork, Ireland for a time in the mid-1990s. 

In April 2008 he travelled to Singapore and Thailand in pursuit of new business ventures in Southeast Asia. Until his death he was actively involved in his restaurant Floyd&#x27;s Brasserie, located at the Burasari Resort on the popular Thai island of Phuket. This was his first Asian restaurant and Phuket&#x27;s first ever celebrity chef restaurant, drawing a large following of Floyd fans who remembered his many TV series and cookbooks.

Floyd travelled widely to cook local dishes and entertain people around the world.

A documentary &quot;Keith Meets Keith&quot;, featuring actor and comedian Keith Allen interviewing Floyd, was broadcast on Channel 4 on 14 September 2009 and watched by nearly one million people. In the programme Floyd was severely critical of modern television chefs for promoting themselves more than the food. Floyd admitted away from the cameras that he often drank too much out of loneliness. It later emerged that Floyd had collapsed and died a few hours before the broadcast.

In 2020, Floyd was the subject of &#x27;Keith Floyd&#x27;s Bristol&#x27;, a documentary presented by Xander Brett. It was produced by Burst Radio, later broadcast on BBC Radio Bristol to mark eleven years since his death.

===Other television work===
He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1991 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel in The Brazen Head pub in Dublin.

Floyd can also be seen in a number of episodes of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Balamory&quot;, as a chef in Suzie Sweet&#x27;s &quot;Suzie&#x27;s Cooking&quot; song.

In 2006, he also appeared on the ITV show &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot;, demonstrating to the pair how to bake a cake for their Ant vs Dec challenge of cake decorating, resulting in Dec (Donnelly) winning the challenge.

==Honours==
Floyd had a bistro bar named after him in Thailand on the island of Koh Samui, Floyd&#x27;s Beach Bistro Restaurant; Floyd visited it while filming the series &quot;Far Flung Floyd&quot; in Thailand and developed a close relationship with the family who owned the resort.

==Personal life==
All four of Floyd&#x27;s marriages ended in divorce; he had a son and daughter.

Floyd spent many years in France. In 1974 he moved to Vaucluse department, in the south-east of France, with Paddy Walker and her three young children. Together, they formed a company called Walker Floyd, buying wines in Vaucluse and then driving them back to Bristol to be sold to the city&#x27;s bars and restaurants. They would then buy interesting, and carefully picked out, pieces of bric-a-brac to be driven back to Vaucluse for sale in the various markets. Paddy Walker and Floyd also ran a restaurant together in the village of L&#x27;Isle-sur-la-Sorgue in the Vaucluse. In his autobiography, Floyd notes Walker&#x27;s influence on him: &quot;My approach to food, my style if you like, had developed as a result of my life in France with Paddy.&quot; In 1979, after five years together, Walker and Floyd&#x27;s relationship broke down and they returned to Britain.

In his last few years Floyd moved back to Avignon in the Vaucluse department.

Floyd was a big fan of rock group the Stranglers: the tracks &quot;Waltzinblack&quot;, an edited version of &quot;Peaches&quot;, and an instrumental version of &quot;Viva Vlad&quot; were used as theme music for most of his TV programmes.

==Illness and death==

In October 2002 Floyd, a smoker and a heavy drinker, was reported to have suffered a mild stroke, although he denied this in his autobiography. In November 2004 he was banned from driving for 32 months and fined £1,500 after crashing his car into another vehicle while three-and-a-half times over the legal alcohol limit. He suspected he had lung cancer or emphysema in early 2006, but was given the all-clear after a medical examination. In the summer of 2006 he was diagnosed as suffering from malnutrition.

In August 2007 he was hospitalised in Thailand after collapsing in a restaurant. He collapsed at a pub in Chesterton, Staffordshire, on 29 January 2008 and was in a coma in hospital on a life-support machine. He was discharged on 22 February, travelling to his home in France to recuperate. He made a full recovery. On 14 September 2008, exactly a year before his death, he collapsed and was hospitalised for several days.

Floyd died of a heart attack, aged 65, on 14 September 2009, at the Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester, Dorset, after being taken ill at the home of his partner Celia Martin (née Constanduros).

The following day chefs provided quotes for the media. Antony Worrall Thompson said of him: &quot;I think all of us modern TV chefs owe a living to him. He kind of spawned us all.&quot; Marco Pierre White said that Floyd &quot;inspired a nation&quot;. White also said, &quot;The thing which is very sad is a little piece of Britain today died which will never be replaced. He was a beautiful man, his ability to inspire people to cook just with his words and the way he did things was extraordinary. If you look at TV chefs today they don&#x27;t have his magic.&quot; Floyd&#x27;s humanist funeral took place on 30 September 2009 in Bristol.

<doc id="560092" wikidata="Q7585516" url="?curid=560092" title="Henry Scudamore, 3rd Duke of Beaufort">
<text>Henry Somerset-Scudamore, 3rd Duke of Beaufort (23 March 1707 – 26 February 1745), born Lord Henry Somerset, was an English nobleman and peer who supported Jacobitism.

==Life==
He was the elder son of Henry Somerset, 2nd Duke of Beaufort and his second wife, Rachel Noel. As his father&#x27;s eldest son and heir to his father&#x27;s title he was known as (styled) Marquess of Worcester, a courtesy title. On his father&#x27;s death on 24 April 1714, he succeeded him and became 3rd Duke of Beaufort.

At the age of 19, Beaufort commissioned the construction of what would later become known as the Badminton Chest or Badminton Cabinet, an ornate set of drawers made in Florence. The chest was sold in 2004 to Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein for £19 million, making it the most expensive piece of furniture in the world. It is on display in the Palais Liechtenstein in Vienna, Austria.

The Duke was one of several founding governors of Britain&#x27;s first institution for abandoned children, the Foundling Hospital, and his name is listed in its royal charter received from George II in October 1739.

In 1743, he was one of several leading English Tories who communicated with the French government through Francis Sempill in order to elicit French support for an invasion to restore the Stuart line.

After his death, the 3rd Duke of Beaufort was buried at St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton. His memorial was sculpted by John Michael Rysbrack in 1754.

Because he had no legitimate children, his titles and estates were inherited by his younger brother, Charles Noel Somerset.

==Family==

On 28 June 1729 Beaufort married Frances Scudamore, the only daughter and heir of James Scudamore, 3rd Viscount Scudamore, and took his wife&#x27;s name by a private act of Parliament, the (3 Geo. 2. c. &quot;10&quot; ), later the same year.
In 1742 Beaufort filed for divorce over Frances&#x27;s adulterous relationship with William Talbot, who later became Earl Talbot. Frances countersued, saying the Duke was impotent; in March 1743, he demonstrated before court-appointed examiners that he was physically able to have an erection. The divorce was granted by the (17 Geo. 2. c. &quot;2&quot; ), and he sued Talbot for damages. Frances later remarried, to Charles FitzRoy-Scudamore.

Beaufort had one illegitimate daughter, Margaret Burr, who married the painter Thomas Gainsborough and had issue.

<text>The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA ) is a United States federal payroll (or employment) tax payable by both employees and employers to fund Social Security and Medicare—federal programs that provide benefits for retirees, people with disabilities, and children of deceased workers.

==Calculation==

===Overview===
The Federal Insurance Contributions Act is a tax mechanism codified in Title 26, Subtitle C, Chapter 21 of the United States Code.

Social security benefits include old-age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI); Medicare provides hospital insurance benefits for the elderly. The amount that one pays in payroll taxes throughout one&#x27;s working career is associated indirectly with the social security benefits annuity that one receives as a retiree. Consequently, Kevin Hassett wrote that FICA is not a tax because its collection is directly tied to benefits that one is entitled to collect later in life. However, the United States Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Flemming v. Nestor&quot; (1960) that the Social Security system is neither a pension nor an insurance program and that no one has an accrued property right to benefits from the system regardless of how much that person may have contributed. FICA therefore behaves as a tax for all practical purposes, earmarked for particular uses by Congress but fully subject to Congressional authority, including redirection.

The FICA tax applies to earned income only and is not imposed on investment income such as rental income, interest, or dividends. The Hospital Insurance (HI) portion of FICA, which funds Medicare Part A hospital benefits, applies to all earned income, while the OASDI portion of the tax is imposed on earned income only up to cap annually set by Congress ($160,200 in 2023). In 2004, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities stated that three-quarters of taxpayers pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes. FICA is subject to neither the standard deduction nor any personal exemption and so is generally considered to be a regressive tax.

===Regularly employed people===
Since 1990, the employee&#x27;s share of the Social Security portion of the FICA tax has been 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit that adjusts with inflation. The taxation limit in 2020 was $137,700 of gross compensation, resulting in a maximum Social Security tax for 2020 of $8,537.40. This limit, known as the Social Security Wage Base, goes up each year based on average national wages and, in general, at a faster rate than the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U). The employee&#x27;s share of the Medicare portion of the tax is 1.45% of wages, with no limit on the amount of wages subject to the Medicare portion of the tax. Because some payroll compensation may be subject to federal and state income tax withholding in addition to Social Security tax withholding and Medicare tax withholding, the Social Security and Medicare taxes often account for only a portion of the total an employee pays.

The employer is also liable for 6.2% Social Security and 1.45% Medicare taxes, making the total Social Security tax 12.4% of wages and the total Medicare tax 2.9%. (Self-employed people are responsible for the entire FICA percentage of 15.3% (= 12.4% + 2.9%), since they are in a sense both the employer and the employed; see the section on self-employed people for more details.)

If a worker starts a new job halfway through the year and during that year has already earned an amount exceeding the Social Security tax wage base limit with the old employer, the new employer is not allowed to stop withholding until the wage base limit has been earned with the new employer (that is, without regard to the wage base limit earned under the old employer). There are some limited cases, such as a successor-predecessor employer transfer, in which the payments that have already been withheld can be counted toward the year-to-date total.

If a worker has overpaid toward Social Security by having more than one job or by having switched jobs during the year, that worker can file a request to have that overpayment counted as a credit for tax paid when he or she files a federal income tax return. If the taxpayer is due a refund, then the FICA tax overpayment is refunded.

===Self-employed people===
A tax similar to the FICA tax is imposed on the earnings of self-employed individuals, such as independent contractors and members of a partnership. This tax is imposed not by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act but instead by the Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954 (SECA), which is codified as Chapter 2 of Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, through (the &quot;SE Tax Act&quot;). Under the SE Tax Act, self-employed people are responsible for the entire percentage of 15.3% (= 12.4% [Soc. Sec.] + 2.9% [Medicare]); however, the 15.3% multiplier is applied to 92.35% of the business&#x27;s &quot;net earnings from self-employment&quot;, rather than 100% of the gross earnings; the difference, 7.65%, is half of the 15.3%, and makes the calculation fair in comparison to that of regular (non-self-employed) employees.

SECA requires self-employed individuals in the United States to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. If a self-employed individual has net earnings of $400 or more in a tax year, they are generally required to pay SECA taxes. Self-employed individuals are responsible for paying both the employer and employee portions of these taxes. However, exceptions and specific rules may apply based on the nature of self-employment and individual circumstances.

==Exemptions==
===Some students===
Some student workers are exempt from FICA tax. Students enrolled at least half-time in a university and working part-time for the same university are exempted from FICA payroll taxes if and only if their relationship with the university is primarily an educational one. In order to be exempt from FICA payroll taxes, a student&#x27;s work must be &quot;incident to&quot; the pursuit of a course of study, which is rarely the case with full-time employment. However full-time college students are never exempt from FICA taxes on work performed off-campus.

Medical residents working full-time are not considered students and are not exempt from FICA payroll taxes, according to a United States Supreme Court ruling in 2011.

A student enrolled and regularly attending classes at a school, college, or university who performs work as a cook, waiter, butler, maid, janitor, laundress, furnaceman, handyman, gardener, housekeeper, housemother, or similar duties in or around the club rooms or house of a local college club, or in or about the club rooms or house of a local chapter of a college fraternity or sorority, are exempt from FICA tax. If the location&#x27;s primary purpose is to provide room or board, however, then the work is subject to FICA tax. Performing these services for an alumni club or alumni chapter also does not qualify for the exemption from FICA tax.

===Employees of some state governments and local governments===
A number of state and local employers and their employees in the states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Ohio, and Texas are currently exempt from paying the Social Security portion of FICA taxes. They provide alternative retirement and pension plans to their employees. FICA initially did not apply to state and local governments, which were later given the option of participating. Over time, most have elected to participate, but a substantial number remain outside the system.

===Certain payments by Native Americans, Native Americans tribal governments, and Native Americans entities===
Payments to members of a federally recognized Native American tribe for services performed as council members are not subject to FICA. 

If a member of a federally recognized Native American tribe that has recognized fishing rights or a qualified Native American entity employs another member of the same Native American tribe for a fishing rights-related activity, the wages are exempt from FICA.

===Some nonresident aliens===
Some nonresident aliens are exempt from FICA tax. 
* Nonresident aliens who are employees of foreign governments are exempt from FICA on wages paid in their official capacities as foreign government employees.
* Nonresident aliens who are employed by a foreign employer as a crew member are exempt from FICA on wages paid for working on a foreign ship or foreign aircraft. 
* Nonresident aliens who are students, scholars, professors, teachers, trainees, researchers, physicians, au pairs, or summer camp workers and are temporarily in the United States in F-1, J-1, M-1, Q-1, or Q-2 nonimmigrant status are exempt from FICA on wages paid to them for services that are allowed by their visa status and are performed to carry out the purposes the visa status.
* Nonresident aliens who are employees of international organizations are exempt from FICA on wages paid by international organizations.
* Nonresident aliens who are on an H-2A, H-2B, or H-2R visa and are residents of the Philippines are exempt from FICA on wages paid for work performed in Guam.
* Nonresident aliens who are on an H-2A visa are exempt from FICA.

===Members of some religious groups===
Members of certain religious groups, such as the Mennonites and the Amish, may apply to be exempt from paying FICA tax. These religious groups consider insurance to be a lack of trust in God, and see it as their religious duty to provide for members who are sick, disabled, or elderly. 

In order to apply to become exempt from paying FICA tax under this provision, the person must file Form 4029, which certifies that the person:
* Waives the person&#x27;s rights to all benefits under the Social Security Act; 
* Is a member of a recognized religious group that is conscientiously opposed to accepting benefits under a private plan or system that makes payments in the event of death, disability, or retirement, or which makes payments towards the costs of or provides for medical care, including the benefits of any insurance system established by Social Security; 
* Is a member of a religious group that makes a reasonable provision of food, shelter, and medical care for its dependent members and has done so continuously since December 31, 1950; and 
* Has never received or been entitled to any benefits payable under Social Security programs.

People who claim the above exemption must agree to notify the Internal Revenue Service within 60 days of either leaving the religious group or no longer following the established teachings of the religious group.

===Some aliens on temporary work assignment===
When a person temporarily works outside their country of origin, the person may be covered under two different countries&#x27; social security programs for the same work. In order to relieve a person of double-taxation, the certain countries and the United States have entered into tax treaties, known as totalization agreements.

Aliens whose employer sends them to the United States on a temporary work assignment may be exempt from paying FICA tax on their earnings from working in the United States if there is a totalization agreement between the United States and the worker&#x27;s home country. Countries who have such a tax treaty with the United States include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.

In order to claim an exemption from paying FICA tax, the alien worker must be on a temporary assignment of no more than five years and the alien worker must have a certificate from the country stating that the worker will continue to be covered by the country&#x27;s social security system while the worker is in the United States.

===Some family employees===
When a parent employs a child under age 18 (or under age 21 for domestic service), payments to the child are exempt from FICA tax. The exemption also applies when a child is employed by a partnership in which each partner is a parent of the child. The exemption does not apply when the child is employed by a corporation or a partnership with partners who are not the child&#x27;s parent.

===Foreign governments and some international organizations===
Foreign governments are exempt from FICA tax on payments to their employees. International organizations are also exempt if the organization is listed in the International Organizations Immunities Act.

If an employee is a U.S. citizen, then the employee must typically pay self-employment tax on earnings from work performed in the United States.

===Services performed by certain individuals hired to be relieved from unemployment===
If a state or local government pays individuals for services performed to be relieved from unemployment, the payments to the individuals are exempt from FICA tax. The services must not be performed by individuals under other types of programs. Payments are not exempt from FICA tax if the program&#x27;s primary purpose is to increase an individual&#x27;s chances of employment by providing training and work experience.

===Services performed by inmates===
Payments to inmates of a prison for services performed for the state or local government that operates the prison are exempt from FICA tax, regardless of the location where the services are performed. Services performed as part of a work-release program are exempt from FICA tax if and only if the individuals are not considered employees under common law, such as when the individual has control over what work is done and how the work it is done. 

===Services performed by patients===
Payments to patients of an institution for services performed for the state of local government that operates the institution are exempt from FICA tax. Services performed by patients as part of an institution&#x27;s rehabilitative program or therapeutic program are exempt from FICA tax.

===Certain emergency workers===
If a state or local government&#x27;s employees were hired on a temporary basis in response to a specific unforeseen fire, storm, snow, earthquake, flood, or a similar emergency, and the employee is not intended to become a permanent employee, then payments to that employee are exempt from FICA tax. In order to qualify for the exemption from FICA tax, the employee must have been hired to work temporarily in connection with an unforeseen emergency, such as an individual temporarily hired to battle a major forest fire, to respond to a volcano eruption, or to help people affected by a severe earthquake or flood. Regular long-term police employees and regular long-term fire employees do not qualify under this particular exemption from FICA tax.

===Certain newspaper carriers===
Payments to newspaper carriers under age 18 are exempt from FICA tax.

===Some real estate agents and salespeople===
Compensation for real estate agents and salespeople is exempt from FICA tax under certain circumstances. The compensation is exempt if substantially all compensation is directly related to sales or other output, rather than to the number of hours worked, and there is a written contract stating that the individuals will not be treated as employees for federal tax purposes. The individual must typically pay self-employment tax on the compensation.

==History==
Prior to the Great Depression, the following presented difficulties for Americans:
* The U.S. had no federally mandated retirement savings; consequently, for those people who had not voluntarily saved money throughout their working lives, the end of their work careers was the end of all income.
* Similarly, the U.S. had no federally mandated disability income insurance to provide for citizens disabled by injuries (of any kind—non-work-related); consequently, for most people, a disabling injury meant no more income (since most people have little to no income except earned income from work).
* In addition, there was no federally mandated disability income insurance to provide for people unable to ever work during their lives, such as anyone born with severe mental retardation.
* Further, the U.S. had no federally mandated health insurance for the elderly; consequently, for many people, the end of their work careers was the end of their ability to pay for medical care.

In the 1930s, the New Deal introduced Social Security to rectify the first three problems (retirement, injury-induced disability, or congenital disability). It introduced the FICA tax as the means to pay for Social Security.

In the 1960s, Medicare was introduced to rectify the fourth problem (health care for the elderly). The FICA tax was increased in order to pay for this expense.

In December 2010, as part of the legislation that extended the Bush tax cuts (called the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010), the government negotiated a temporary, one-year reduction in the FICA payroll tax. In February 2012, the tax cut was extended for another year.

Under FICA, the payroll tax applies to &quot;wages&quot; (defined by the act as &quot;remuneration for employment&quot;). In 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously held in &quot;United States v. Quality Stores, Inc.&quot; that severance pay is taxable wages for FICA purposes.

In August 2020, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to temporarily suspend collection of the tax from September to December 2020. Critics fear this move will lead to more underfunding of the Social Security Trust Fund and Medicare trust fund.

==Criticism==

The Social Security component of the FICA tax is regressive. That is, the effective tax rate regresses, or decreases, as income increases beyond the compensation limit or wage base limit amount. The Social Security component is a flat tax for wage levels under the Social Security Wage Base (see &quot;Regular&quot; employees above). Because no tax is owed on wages above the wage base limit amount, the total tax rate declines as wages increase beyond that limit. In other words, for wage levels above the limit, the absolute dollar amount of tax owed remains constant.

The earnings above the wage base limit amount are not, however, taken into account in the Primary Insurance Amount (PIA) to determine benefits payable under the various insurance programs of social security.

The FICA tax also is not imposed on unearned income, including interest on savings deposits, stock dividends, and capital gains such as profits from the sale of stock or real estate. The proportion of total income that is exempt from FICA tax as &quot;unearned income&quot; tends to rise with higher income brackets.

Some, including Third Way, argue that since Social Security taxes are eventually returned to taxpayers, with interest, in the form of Social Security benefits, the regressiveness of the tax is effectively negated. That is, the taxpayer gets back (more or less) what they put into the Social Security system. Others, including &quot;The Economist&quot; and the Congressional Budget Office, point out that the Social Security system as a whole is progressive in the lower income brackets. Individuals with lower lifetime average wages receive a larger benefit (as both a percentage of their lifetime average wage income and a percentage of Social Security taxes paid) than do individuals with higher lifetime average wages; but for some lower earners, shorter lifetimes may negate the benefits.

<doc id="560097" wikidata="Q387122" url="?curid=560097" title="Read My Lips (Sophie Ellis-Bextor album)">
<text>Read My Lips is the debut studio album by English singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, released on 3 September 2001 by Polydor Records. After the disbandment of the Britpop group Theaudience, for which Ellis-Bextor served as lead vocalist, she was signed to Polydor. Prior to the LP&#x27;s completion, the singer collaborated with several musicians, including band Blur&#x27;s bassist Alex James, Moby and New Radicals frontman Gregg Alexander. The record was described as a collection of 1980s electronica and 1970s disco music.

Critical response to &quot;Read My Lips&quot; was polarised, with music critics denouncing its content that was, according to one magazine, Q, of lesser quality than &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot;—the singer&#x27;s collaboration with Italian DJ Spiller and according to others, inherently malign simply on account of being chart pop. The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, and has since been certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It spawned four singles: &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;, double A-side single &quot;Get Over You&quot;/&quot;Move This Mountain&quot; and &quot;Music Gets the Best of Me&quot;.

==Background==

Following the disbandment of Britpop group Theaudience, Ellis-Bextor provided vocals for the song &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot; by Italian DJ Spiller. The song was a commercial success, and Ellis-Bextor signed to Polydor. She was contacted by director Baz Luhrmann, who offered her a role in the 2001 film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot;, but the singer refused in order to focus on her career as a recording artist. The success of &quot;Groovejet&quot; also prompted American musician Moby to notice Ellis-Bextor, and revealed interest in working with her due to her &quot;amazing&quot; voice, as he described it. He instructed his record company to &quot;track&quot; Ellis-Bextor &quot;down&quot; so they could start working as soon as Moby finished his tour. The two ultimately wrote five songs in New York City, which did not make the final cut of &quot;Read My Lips&quot;. Furthermore, she also recorded with Blur bassist Alex James, as well as former frontman of the New Radicals, Gregg Alexander, while Damian LeGassick was recruited for his programming and keyboard work.

The album&#x27;s title was chosen due to the strong lipstick Ellis-Bextor used for the album artwork, the &quot;Take Me Home&quot; music video and &quot;Read My Lips&quot; is sung in the opening verse of the album track &quot;The Universe Is You&quot;. The album photography was shot by Mert Alaş and Marcus Piggot.

==Composition==
An &quot;eclectic&quot; album, &quot;Read My Lips&quot;, is a collection of 1980s electronica and 1970s disco. The album opener and first single is a cover version of Cher&#x27;s 1979 song &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, described as a &quot;disco groove&quot;. Betty Clarke from &quot;The Guardian&quot; observed that her voice in the song is reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s Eliza Doolittle (in the film &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;). &quot;Move This Mountain&quot;, co-written by Alex James, is a &quot;vibrant&quot; ballad with a trip hop-influenced sound. Following track and second single, &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;, is a dance-pop and disco record, that utilises bass guitar and piano in its instrumental. &quot;Sparkle&quot; has &quot;speeding beats and equally speeding keyboards&quot;, while &quot;Final Move&quot; contains &quot;tinny beats&quot; and &quot;electro swirls&quot;. The latter was deemed a &quot;subdued version&quot; of &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot; with &quot;similar kaleidoscope synth&quot;. &quot;I Believe&quot; was described as &quot;funky&quot; and &quot;live-sounding&quot;, while &quot;Leave the Others Alone&quot; involves &quot;cold beats&quot; and &quot;big, full-throttle keyboards&quot;. &quot;By Chance&quot; was particularly noted for showcasing Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s accent. Re-release new song &quot;Get Over You&quot; is a &quot;polite&quot; Euro disco take on &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.

==Singles and promotion==
Promotion for &quot;Read My Lips&quot; launched with the release of &quot;Take Me Home&quot;, a cover of the song by singer Cher, which was released on 13 August 2001. Although its production and Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s vocal performance in the song were heavily criticised, the single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. After the release of the album, &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot; was serviced as its second single on 3 December 2001. It peaked in the top 10 of the charts in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. A double A-side single including new re-release song &quot;Get Over You&quot; and original album track &quot;Move This Mountain&quot; was released on 10 June 2002, in a set of two CD singles.

Ellis-Bextor, who had previously felt uncomfortable with the idea of touring, confirmed a UK-only tour in January 2002, which took place from April to May. Later, in July 2002, other dates of the tour were revealed for 2003.

==Critical reception==
Toby Manning from &quot;Q&quot; cited &quot;Take Me Home&quot; and &quot;Move This Mountain&quot; as the album&#x27;s highlights, but, overall, he thought that the record failed to live up to the standard set by the previous collaboration with Spiller. He also found that the album&#x27;s music and the distinctive pronunciation of Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s vocal delivery did not work to complimentary effect. Betty Clarke from &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the album as a &quot;sophisticated package&quot; but said &quot;there&#x27;s little to love and even less fun to be had&quot;. Kelvin Hayes from AllMusic dubbed it &quot;a disappointing debut from Ellis-Bextor, fusing Human League synth with beats and cinematic strings&quot;, but described &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot; as the &quot;shimmering highlight&quot; from the album. A critic from entertainment.ie said &quot;the material on her debut solo album only rarely does justice to her distinctive upper-crust voice&quot;, and said that &quot;most of the songs sound laboured and plod where they should swing&quot;.

In contrast to the previous reviews, Andrew Arora from Blue Coupe had a more positive response to the record. Arora said &quot;it lands somewhere between Pet Shop Boys&#x27; synth-pop faculty and Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; album&quot;, although he claimed that fans of &quot;Groovejet (If This Ain&#x27;t Love)&quot; &quot;should not expect much from this album, but it does deliver a dynamic electro disco sound that is sometimes analogous to her breakthrough-hit single&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Read My Lips&quot; debuted at number four on the UK Albums Chart, selling 23,023 copies in its first week. Although the original ten-track edition dropped down and out of the charts over the next few weeks, a twelve-track UK edition, released in December 2001, peaked at number three in January 2002 following the chart success of &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;. Finally, a fifteen-track edition with a considerably revised running order was released in summer 2002 and peaked at number two—41 weeks after the original edition first charted. The album was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 21 June 2002. As of December 2020, it had sold 842,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

<text>The Adams Company is an American manufacturing concern. It was founded in 1883 and is based in Dubuque, Iowa, United States.

Between 1905 and 1912 it produced the Adams-Farwell, a brass era automobile.

==History==
The Roberts &amp; Langworthy Iron Works, located at 57 South Main Street in Dubuque, were manufacturers of &quot;fine light castings&quot; like grave crosses and park benches. Eugene Adams invested in the company in June 1883 when Roberts decided to retire, and Adams took the position of a secretary and manager. A change of the company name to Langworthy and Adams Iron Works followed in 1885. When Langworthy retired in 1892, Eugene&#x27;s brother Herbert bought his share and the company was re-organized as The Adams Company, a foundry and machine shop. The plant burnt down the same year in a disastrous fire, and the company opened new facilities at East Fourth Street. Now, machine castings and household devices like a patented &quot;floor heating vent with inner rotating portion&quot; that distributed warm air in upper level rooms, or &quot;laundry stoves&quot; were added. In 1895, Fay Oliver Farwell (1859–1935) became manager of the company.

===The Adams-Farwell automobile===
About 1895, Farwell began experimenting with an internal combustion engined automobile, for which he conceived a horizontally mounted rotary engine with three cylinders. The vertically standing crank shaft was fixed in the chassis. Farwell felt this configuration was lighter than conventional engines as it used neither a flywheel — since the spinning engine crankcase and cylinders acted as their own flywheel when running — nor radiator, because of its air cooled design. Farwell completed the first prototype in 1898. Basically a horse-drawn carriage, he mounted his engine between the front wheels. This proved impractical, so his second car, appropriately named number 2, had the engine installed in the rear as all Adams-Farwells would thereafter. This car used bicycle wheels; the next had wooden artillery wheels. Little is known about car number 4, which probably was similar to number 3, and which was sold to a Dubuque resident. Number 5 was shown at the Chicago Auto Show in February 1905. Now, first orders were taken. With only minor modifications, the car went into - very limited - production as the Model 6 20/25 hp. Referring to its engine, Adams-Farwell frequently used the slogan: &quot;It spins like a top&quot;.

An Automobile Quarterly article credits Mr. Farwell&#x27;s inspiration for his rotary radial engine to have been a steam winch he had witnessed in operation in the late 19th century. Also mentioned in the cited article is the participation of an Adams-Farwell automobile in the first automobile race in America, but that is refuted by the following citation: 

====Innovations====
Adams-Farwell automobiles had further unique details. The only available coachwork, called a Convertible Brougham, was in fact a Town brougham, and the &quot;convertible&quot; part was not the top but driver&#x27;s position. His bench seat in the front of the car was retractable and could fold away in inclement weather, thus forming a splash board. Then, the tiller and driving devices could easily be relocated in front of the rear seat, under the fixed top. These cars could even be started from the driver&#x27;s seat as they provided a lever that had to be pulled up instead of the usual crank. This car was listed at US$2500, placing it in the lower luxury car field. It is this concept that leads to the claim that Adams-Farwell automobiles were among the first automobiles that could be driven year-round.

For 1906, Model 6 became Series 6. A new Series 6 40/45 hp with a five cylinder rotary was added. The car got a somewhat longer wheelbase, and a Landaulet body style replaced the Brougham, probably very similar but with a convertible rear part of the top. New to the line was a touring car, frequently called a Convertible Runabout. Both body styles were 5-seaters.

Three more cars were offered with the 40/45 hp engine only. One was an Extension Brougham with a longer wheelbase, the other, the Model 7-A, was a 7-passenger touring with a conventional looking front; the engine still was in the rear. The rear seat was slightly moved forward. While standard wheelbase was , the Extension Brougham&#x27;s was , and the 7-A&#x27;s . All got the retractable front seat bench and the unique steering system. The third new car was different. Called the Model 8-A Gentleman&#x27;s Speed Roadster, it had the shortest chassis with , and the larger engine. Instead of using the familiar frame with a separate body, it had no chassis at all, anticipating later unibody constructions. This sports car was very fast for the time with a top speed of around .

The only remaining Adams-Farwell automobile shows a tag by the Connolly Carriage &amp; Buggy Co. It seems this company, not only reputed for quality carriages and coachwork, also built the chassis for the Adams-Farwell. As period advertisements indicate complete cars were offered, there is some evidence they might have built the bulk of the Adam-Farwell bodies.

For 1907, most models were gone, and Adams-Farwell offered only an improved Model 7-A Touring, now with an even longer wheelbase and a higher price.

Farwell had more ideas to offer. For 1908, a new Model 9 50 hp appeared. It seems this the first Adams-Farwell with a new and ingenious four speed transmission. Since most contemporary cars had three speeds, the new Adams-Farwell offered an ingenious construction consisting of the transmission, two clutches, a lever for each of them, and one handle to operate the levers. One clutch engaged gears 2 and 4, the other gears 1, 3, and reverse. So, two speeds could be &quot;preselected&quot;, but the one-handle operation prevented two speeds being engaged at the same time. Further, antiquated tiller steering was replaced by a wheel, and there was a pedal for acceleration. Therefore, the removable steering was no longer offered, but Adams-Farwells got a rail instead in which the column and pedal could be moved from the left to the right, allowing the driver to sit either at the left, the right or in the center. Model 9 came as 7-passenger touring, a 3-passenger coupé, and 3-passenger roadster, the latter replacing the Model 8-A, featuring normal chassis and body construction.

A final change came for 1909. The coupé was dropped, the roadster got one more seat, and the touring became even longer. Adam-Farwells were offered until 1912 (or 1913, depending on source) in this lineup. Then, production of automobiles ceased after just about 200 cars built. Usually, 25 cars per year left the factory, with 52-54 in 1910. A few of them went to the Dubuque Police Department.

====Adam-Farwell models====
The small company brought out an impressive number of models, with some ingenious solutions for contemporary problems of driving:

1906 advertisements show a touring car with &quot;fake&quot; hood, designated Model L. It seems this is the Model 7-A 40/45 hp; there is no additional information about it, and there is no further evidence more models existed than listed above.

====The only surviving Adams-Farwell====
The National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada owns the last existing Adams-Farwell automobile, a Series 6 40/45 hp Touring Victoria coach, built by the Connolly Carriage &amp; Buggy Company, probably of Dubuque. This car was invited to the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance in 2011 where it won the Charles A. Chayne Trophy for the most advanced technology of its period.

===Post-automobile company history===
Like another builder of rotary engined road vehicles, Stephen Marius Balzer of New York City, the Adams Company offered light gyrocopter engines which successfully powered experimental flying machines by Emile Berliner in 1909–1910 and J. Newton Williams in 1909. Engine production lasted longer than automobile manufacture although it is not clear when this stopped, too. The Adams Company then relied on their iron foundry and manufactured gears, shafts and parts for power transmissions.

When F. Oliver Farwell left the company in 1921. He had about 20 patents to his name and tried to build up a business on one he held for a novel transmission for merry-go-rounds. Later, he worked in a gear-cutting company in Toledo, Ohio.

As of November 2017, The Adams Company continues as a custom manufacturer of industrial gears and shafts. It is a closely-held private corporation.

<doc id="560102" wikidata="Q1930492" url="?curid=560102" title="Shoot from the Hip">
<text>Shoot from the Hip is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Sophie Ellis-Bextor, released on 27 October 2003 by Polydor Records. It was produced by Gregg Alexander, Matt Rowe, Jeremy Wheatley and Damian LeGassick.

==Background==
The album was released in Europe in October 2003, but little interest was generated outside the United Kingdom, where the album peaked at number 19 on the UK Albums Chart, with the exception of Switzerland, where it peaked at number 35 on the Swiss Albums Chart. As with the single &quot;Music Gets The Best Of Me&quot; the previous year, the album suffered from being caught in a glut of new releases in the approach to Christmas. Consequently, the album was cited as the singer&#x27;s least commercially successful album until the release of her fourth studio album, &quot;Make a Scene&quot;, which reached number 33. The album only produced two singles—&quot;Mixed Up World&quot; and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Change You&quot;—which reached number 7 and number 9 on the UK Singles Chart, respectively.

Apart from &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;, none of Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s solo material was released in the US until June 2007, when &quot;Shoot from the Hip&quot; was added to the American iTunes Store. The songs &quot;I Won&#x27;t Dance with You&quot; and &quot;The Walls Keep Saying Your Name&quot; feature backing vocals (and one verse of lead vocal on the latter song) from Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s ex-boyfriend and ex-manager, Andy Boyd, although his name does not appear anywhere in the album credits.

Similarly to &quot;Sparkle&quot; and &quot;Final Move&quot; missing from the worldwide version of &quot;Read My Lips&quot;, the international edition of &quot;Shoot from the Hip&quot; does not include the opening track &quot;Making Music&quot;, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Dance with You&quot; nor the hidden track following the end of &quot;Hello, Hello&quot;, a cover of Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s &quot;Physical&quot;. The international edition also changes all text on the cover, disc and in the booklet to the shade of turquoise instead of the white used on the UK release.

In 2014, Ellis-Bextor reflected on the album to &quot;Attitude&quot; magazine, saying: &quot;The second album still had the same feel as the first, but it was maybe a little bit darker. During that record I was going through a bit of a break-up so there are a few break-up songs on there. I wasn&#x27;t feeling quite as funny and breezy as I was on the first album, but I got it back on album three.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Writing for &quot;musicOMH&quot;, Sarah McDonnell highlighted the input from Bernard Butler, feeling that different co-writers make the album &quot;patchy in places&quot; and as a result, Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s songs &quot;sometimes sound a little self-conscious and clunky, almost a little too earnestly conveying her message&quot;. Nevertheless, McDonnell also stated &quot;whatever you might think of Sophie Ellis-Bextor, you can&#x27;t fault her determination&quot; and felt that the album is a &quot;good effort and displays an ambition – and potential – to produce consistent, high quality, intelligent pop music&quot;.

K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic said that while the album &quot;lacks anything nearly as distinctive as her early singles, [...] it&#x27;s still a solid, perfectly respectable collection of contemporary dance-pop&quot;, pointing to &quot;the smooth disco single &#x27;Mixed-Up World&#x27; and the chipper &#x27;I Won&#x27;t Change You&#x27;&quot;, the latter of which he compared to &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; by Kylie Minogue. Hoffman further judged &quot;there&#x27;s enough variety to keep the album from sagging, particularly as things turn slightly darker and moodier towards the latter half with the spiky &#x27;You Get Yours&#x27; and the odd, haunted &#x27;The Walls Keep Saying Your Name&#x27;.&quot; However, he felt differently about Butler&#x27;s contribution, pointing out &quot;the understated ballad &#x27;I Am Not Good at Not Getting What I Want&#x27; [...] rounds things out nicely.&quot;

While McDonnell compared lead single &quot;Mixed Up World&quot; to material by the Pet Shop Boys, Lucy Davies of BBC Music felt that track is similar to &quot;the best 80s PWL creations&quot;. Although singling out the final two tracks (positively comparing the strings in &quot;Hello, Hello&quot; to Andrew Lloyd Webber and questioning why &quot;Physical&quot; is a hidden track when it &quot;encapsulates Sophie; knowingly dead-pan with a little wink tipped at the listener&quot;), Davies used a line from opening song &quot;Making Music&quot; to say the album is largely &quot;making music by numbers&quot;—calling the two songs Boyd contributes vocals on &quot;naff&quot; and the rhyming on &quot;Party in My Head&quot; &quot;cringe worthy&quot;. Davies commented that despite the songs on &quot;Shoot from the Hip&quot; featuring &quot;chewing gum melodies&quot;, &quot;Sophie needs to think long and hard about where she&#x27;s going next.&quot;

entertainment.ie held a similar opinion, summarising that even though &quot;Shoot from the Hip&quot; is a &quot;perfectly efficient pop album&quot;, &quot;it still leaves you wondering what Ellis-Bextor could achieve if she really tried.&quot;

<doc id="560116" wikidata="Q62432" url="?curid=560116" title="August von Platen-Hallermünde">
<text>Karl August Georg Maximilian [[Graf]] von Platen-Hallermünde (24 October 17965 December 1835) was a German poet and dramatist. In German he mostly is called &quot;Graf&quot; (Count) Platen.

==Biography==
August von Platen was born on 24 October 1796 at Ansbach, the son of the &quot;Oberforstmeister&quot; (a senior public servant) of that state, Count Philipp August von Platen-Hallermünde, by second wife Baroness Christiane Eichler von Auriz. Shortly after his birth Ansbach and other Franconian principalities became incorporated with Bavaria. Platen entered the school of cadets (&quot;Kadettenhaus&quot;) in Munich, Bavaria, where he showed early poetic talent. In 1810 as an adolescent he passed into the royal school of pages (&quot;Königliche Pagerie&quot;).

In 1814, Platen was appointed lieutenant in the regiment of Bavarian life-guards. With them he took part in the short campaign in France of 1815, being in bivouac for several months near Mannheim and in the department of the Yonne. He saw no fighting, however, and returned home with his regiment towards the close of the same year. Desiring to study, and finding garrison life distasteful, he obtained a long leave of absence, and after a tour in Switzerland and the Bavarian Alps, entered the University of Würzburg in 1818 as a student of philosophy and philology.
In the following year Platen migrated to the university of Erlangen, where he sat at the feet of Schelling, and became one of his most enthusiastic admirers.

As a result of his Oriental studies Platen published a little volume of poems—&quot;Ghaselen&quot; (1821), each consisting of ten to twenty verses, in which he imitates the style of Rückert; &quot;Lyrische Blätter&quot; (1821); &quot;Spiegel des Hafis&quot; (1822); &quot;Vermischte Schriften&quot; (1822); and &quot;Neue Ghaselen&quot; (1823). These attracted the attention of eminent men of letters among them Goethe, both by reason of their contents, which breathe the spirit of the East, and also of the purity and elegance of their form and diction.

Though Platen was at first influenced by the school of Romanticism, and particularly by Spanish models, the plays written during his university life at Erlangen, &quot;Der gläserne Pantoffel&quot;, &quot;Der Schatz des Rhampsinit&quot;, &quot;Berengar&quot;, &quot;Treue um Treue&quot;, &quot;Der Turm mit sieben Pforten&quot;, show a clearness of plot and expression foreign to the Romantic style. His antagonism to the literature of his day became more and more pronounced, and he vented his indignation at the lack of art shown by the later Romanticists, the inanity of the lyricists, and the bad taste of the so-called fate tragedies (&quot;Schicksalstragödien&quot;), in the witty Aristophanic comedies &quot;Die verhängnißvolle Gabel&quot; (1826) and &quot;Der romantische Oedipus&quot; (1828).

The want of interest, amounting even to hostility, with which Platen&#x27;s enthusiasm for the purity and dignity of poetry was received in many literary circles in Germany increased the poet&#x27;s indignation and disgust. In 1826, he visited Italy, which he henceforth made his home, living at Florence, Rome and Naples. His means were slender, but, though frequently necessitous, he felt happy in the life he had chosen, that of a &quot;wandering rhapsodist&quot;.

Offended by Heinrich Heine&#x27;s mockery of &quot;&quot;die Orientsucht&quot;the obsession with the Orient in poetryin his work &quot;Reisebilder, zweiter Teil&quot; (1827), Platen expressed anti-Semitic sentiment directed at Heine in his work &quot;Der romantische Oedipus&quot; (1828). Heine reacted in turn by publicizing Platen&#x27;s homosexuality in &quot;Reisebilder dritter Teil&quot; (1830). This back and forth of mockery and ad hominem attacks are also referred to as &quot;die von Platen Affaire&quot;&quot;.

In Naples, where Platen formed the friendship of August Kopisch, the poet and painter, were written his last drama &quot;Die Liga von Cambrai&quot; (1833) and the delightful epic fairy-tale &quot;Die Abbassiden&quot; (1830; 1834), besides numerous lyrical poems, odes and ballads. He also essayed historical work in a fragment, &quot;Geschichte des Königreichs Neapel von 1414 bis 1443&quot; (1838), without, however, achieving any marked success.

In 1832, his father died, and after an absence of eight years Platen returned to Germany for a while, and in the winter of 1832–1833 lived at Munich, where he revised the first complete edition of his poems, &quot;Gedichte&quot; (1833).

In the summer of 1834, Platen returned to Italy, and, after living in Florence and Naples, proceeded in 1835 to Sicily. Dread of the cholera, which was at that time very prevalent, induced him to move from place to place, and in November of that year he was taken ill at Syracuse, where he died on 5 December 1835. He is buried in the non-Catholic cemetery of Syracuse.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;Like Heine himself, Platen failed in the drama, but his odes and sonnets, to which must be added his &quot;Polenlieder&quot; (1831), in which he gives vent to his warm sympathy for the Poles in their rising against the rule of the Tsar, are in language and metre so artistically finished as to rank among the best classical poems of modern times&quot;.
He gives his name to the Bavarian literary prize August-Graf-von-Platen-Preis.

<text>August Kopisch (26 May 1799 – 6 February 1853) was a German poet and painter.

==Biography==
Kopisch was born on 26 May 1799 in Breslau, Prussia (now Wrocław, Poland). In 1815 he began studying painting at the Prague academy, but an injury to his hand damaged his prospects of success as an artist, and he turned to literature.

After residences in Dresden and Vienna Kopisch proceeded in 1822 to Italy. At Naples he became close friends with the poet August von Platen-Hallermünde; and when out swimming he and the painter Ernst Fries discovered the &quot;Blue Grotto&quot; of Capri.

In 1828 he settled at Berlin and was granted a pension by Frederick William IV of Prussia, who in 1838 conferred upon him the title of professor.

In 1847 he moved to Potsdam and wrote an account of royal residences there and in the neighborhood.

He died on 6 February 1853 at Berlin.

==Works==

Kopisch produced some original poetry, light in language and in form. He specialised in re-telling legends and popular subjects, and among his &quot;Gedichte&quot; (Berlin, 1836) are some naïve and humorous little ballads such as &quot;Die Historie von Noah&quot;, &quot;Die Heinzelmännchen zu Köln&quot;, &quot;Das grüne Tier&quot; and &quot;Der Schneiderjunge von Krippstedt&quot;, which became popular.

He also published a translation of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (Berlin, 1840), and under the title &quot;Agrumi&quot; (Berlin, 1838) a collection of translations of Italian folk songs.

<text>Permaisuri Siti Aishah (Jawi: ڤرمايسوري سيتي عائشه; born Siti Aishah binti Abdul Rahman; 18 November 1971) is the consort of the 11th Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Al-Haj of Selangor. She was the youngest ever Raja Permaisuri Agong (Queen) of Malaysia, ascending the throne at the age of 28 on 26 April 1999.

==Early life ==
She was born on 18 November 1971 and grew up in Kuala Lumpur. She received her early education at the Jalan Gurney Primary School and her secondary education at the Puteri Titiwangsa Secondary School, Kuala Lumpur. She then furthered her studies in banking at the Kelantan branch campus of the Universiti Teknologi MARA (Formerly known as Institut Teknologi Mara) in Kota Bharu, Kelantan.

==Marriage==
Having married Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah Al-Haj on 3 May 1990, she was made Che Puan Besar of Selangor. On 24 October 1998, she became Tengku Permaisuri of Selangor with style Her Royal Highness Tengku Permaisuri Siti Aishah, Tengku Permaisuri of Selangor.

The second commoner to become Raja Permaisuri Agong, she is believed to have remarried since the death of her husband the late king on 21 November 2001 – a claim which she has since denied.

==Life after the death of Sultan Salahuddin==
She came back into the public eye on New Year&#x27;s Day 2006 for an exclusive interview by &quot;The Star&quot; Malaysia, where the newspaper had wrongly addressed by her former title, &quot;Tuanku Siti Aishah&quot;. The Selangor Council of the Royal Court immediately responded that the widowed consort of the late Sultan of Selangor should instead be properly addressed as Her Highness Permaisuri Siti Aishah. The honorific title Yang Amat Mulia was in recognition of the Darjah Kerabat Yang Amat Dihormati (DK, The Most Honourable Royal Family Order of Selangor), which was conferred on her by her late husband.

In the interview, she talked about her life since the late king (whom she fondly referred to as &quot;Almarhum&quot;) died, how she coped with his death with her family&#x27;s love and support, her role as the former queen of Malaysia, her relationship with the late king, and her hope to find love and remarry again, with her parents&#x27; blessings.

Permaisuri Siti Aishah was also the patron of the UiTM Alumni, Selangor Women’s Association, Selangor Girl Guides, Jantung Hatiku Society and Girl Guides Association of Malaysia.

== Honours ==
She was awarded :

=== Honours of Malaysia ===
** Recipient of the Order of the Crown of the Realm (DMN) (1999)
** First Class of the Royal Family Order of Selangor (DK I) (8.3.1996)
** Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of the Hornbill of Sarawak (DA) – Datuk Amar (20.6.1994)

=== Foreign Honours ===
** Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Chula Chom Klao (1st Class) (27.3.2000)

<doc id="560141" wikidata="Q457871" url="?curid=560141" title="Ken Sugimori">
<text>is a Japanese video game designer, illustrator, manga artist, and director. He is best known as the primary character designer and art director for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. Sugimori is also credited with the art direction for other titles, including &quot;Pulseman&quot;. Sugimori drew and finalized all of the original 151 Pokémon. He has also worked on the various &quot;Pokémon&quot; films, trading cards, and other games like the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

==Career==
From early 1981 until 1986, Sugimori illustrated a gaming fanzine called &quot;Game Freak&quot;, which had been started by Satoshi Tajiri. Sugimori discovered the magazine in a dōjinshi shop, and decided to get involved. Eventually, the two decided to pitch an arcade game design idea to Namco; they reworked Game Freak into a development company and produced &quot;Mendel Palace&quot;. Sugimori is best known as the character designer and art director for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise and designed a large majority of the first 151 Pokémon with Atsuko Nishida, Motofumi Fujiwara, Shigeki Morimoto, and Satoshi Ota. He has worked on the various &quot;Pokémon&quot; movies, trading cards, and other games.

For &quot;Pokémon Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot;, Sugimori directed a team of 17 people in designing new characters for the games, though he always drew the final designs. He drew much of his inspiration from observing animals in aquariums and zoos. Sugimori has also written and illustrated original manga, including one which was distributed with pre-orders of &quot;Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time&quot; and &quot;Explorers of Darkness&quot;. When he begins a new character, his process normally involves making a rough sketch, then tracing it onto film paper while polishing it and making the illustration more professional looking. After that, he draws the character many times, changing its proportions until he is satisfied. When designing a new Pokémon, Sugimori stated that &quot;I do feel that I always want to show new Pokémon that people have never seen before. To do that, I think of ways that I can surprise the players.&quot;

<text>The ATASCII character set, from ATARIStandardCode forInformationInterchange&quot;, alternatively ATARI ASCII&quot;, is a character encoding used in the Atari 8-bit home computers. ATASCII is based on ASCII, but is not fully compatible with it.

The first computers in the Atari 8-bit series are the Atari 400 and 800, released in 1979, and later models were released throughout the 1980s. The last computer to use the ATASCII character set is the Atari XEGS, which was released in 1987 and discontinued in 1992. The Atari ST family of computers use the different Atari ST character set.

Like most other variants of ASCII, ATASCII has its own distinct characters (arrows, blocks, box-drawing characters, playing card suits, etc.) in place of the C0 control codes in ASCII (characters 0–31), as well as replacing a few other ASCII code points.

==Implementation==
Atari 8-bit systems have three distinct sets of codes: interchange codes (ATASCII), internal codes (also called screen codes), and keyboard codes.

Keyboard codes represent the codes sent by the keyboard. Pressing one of the two modifier keys (Shift and Control) modifies the value input by pressing other keys. Due to there being two modifier keys, there are four distinct keyboard codes that can be sent by each character; however, several keys (the exact keys depend on the model) do not send a control code if they are pressed while holding both Shift and Control. When entering text, the Atari keyboard handler converts these signals into ATASCII.

ATASCII and internal codes contain the same character set, but indexed differently. ATASCII codes are used by BASIC, while internal codes are used to look up how to render the character on-screen.

Atari 8-bit systems have several distinct graphics modes; these modes can be classified as pure text modes, pure graphics modes, or mixed modes. Modes 0, 1 and 2 represent pure text modes, while Modes 3 and above represent mixed or pure graphics modes (the exact number of distinct modes depending on the model). Mode 0 displays characters at the default size, Mode 1 displays them twice as wide (but the same height), and Mode 2 displays them twice as wide and twice the height. Mode 0 is the default graphics mode and supports 128 unique characters in one of two colors (regular or inverse video, depending on the upper bit); Modes 1 and 2 only support 64 unique characters, but support four different colors (as they use the upper two bits as color information instead). The 64 characters available in Modes 1 and 2 are the first 64 characters in the internal code, which correspond to ATASCII codes 32 to 95 (0x20 to 0x5F). This includes all uppercase letters and punctuation, but excludes lowercase letters and graphics characters.

The Atari screen editor implements the text cursor by simply inverting the character at the cursor position (by XOR with 0x80). It does not flash.

===Inverse video===
ATASCII only has 128 unique graphic characters, with the upper 128 graphic characters (index 128 to 255) being inverse video variants of the lower 128 graphic characters (index 0 to 127). If the high-order bit is set on a character (i.e., if the byte value of the character is between 128 and 255), the character is generally rendered as the inverse video variant of its counterpart between 0 and 127, using a bitwise negation of the character&#x27;s glyph. This is done by the ANTIC chip.

Due to this behavior, there is asymmetry in the selection of block-drawing characters. In normal video, there are lower triangles but no upper triangles, a left half block but no right half block, and a lower half block but no upper half block; these ostensibly missing characters can be displayed by using inverse video.

===Alternate character sets===

Atari 8-bit computers, via the ANTIC coprocessor, supported indirection of the character set graphics, allowing a program to redefine the graphical glyphs that appear for each ATASCII character. This can be used as a new font for text, to support an additional character set, or for tile graphics in a video game or other application. Cycling between multiple redefined character sets can be used to provide simple animation at very little CPU cost (in exchange for memory used to store the character set data). Altering a character set in RAM can also be used for animation.

In the XL and XE lines, the Atari OS ROM includes an &quot;international character set&quot; that replaces 29 of the graphical glyphs with Latin alphabetical characters containing diacritics, such as e-acute (é). The OS built into the Atari 1200XL, the only Atari 8-bit model with function keys, allowed users to switch between the standard and alternate character sets by pressing . Later XL and XE models required the user to update a register in RAM (e.g., via a POKE command in BASIC).

In some regions, a different character set was included instead of the default international character set, in order to better accommodate the target market, including Polish, Arabic, and Hebrew. Atari 192XT and 256XT systems distributed in Eastern Europe by P.Z.Karen had a Polish character set in place of the international character set. The Atari 65XE Najm, which was distributed in the Middle East, has an Arabic character encoding as its default encoding and displays text right-to-left, while the international character set was replaced by the standard ATASCII encoding. Hebrew versions of the Atari 600XL and 800XL were distributed in Israel, which had a Hebrew character set in place of the international character set. The Hebrew character set had Hebrew letters instead of lowercase Latin letters, but preserved the uppercase Latin letters. When typing in Hebrew mode, typing Latin letters advances the cursor to the right, while typing Hebrew letters advances the cursor to the left.

==Character set==

===Default graphic characters===
The following table shows the default ATASCII character set. Control characters with a graphic representation are displayed using that representation. Each character is shown with a Unicode equivalent.

The box-drawing characters are arranged relative to their corresponding letter keys on the Atari keyboard, appearing 64 code points earlier than the corresponding uppercase letter. For example, ┌, ┬, and ┐ are the graphics characters found on the top left Q, W, and E keys, and appear 64 code points before those uppercase letters in ATASCII.

===International character set===
The following table shows the lower half of ATASCII international character set. The upper half are inverse video variants of the lower half, in exactly the same way as the standard ATASCII character set.

==Control characters==
ATASCII has 16 control characters, defined in four separate ranges (0x1B to 0x1F, 0x7D to 0x7F, 0x8B to 0x8F, and 0xFD to 0xFF). This is a key difference between ASCII and ATASCII—in ASCII, there are 32 control characters, defined in the range 0 to 31 (0x00 to 0x1F).

All ATASCII control characters except End of Line (0x9B) have a graphic representation, which can be produced by escaping that character by pressing the Escape key before inputting that control character. For example, typing &quot;Escape&quot; followed by &quot;cursor right&quot; will produce a right arrow. Uniquely, the End of Line control character always renders a newline, regardless of the presence of a preceding escape character.

==Inter-operation==
The differences between character representation can cause problems during modem communication between Ataris and other computers. Cursor movement commands (and even carriage returns and line feeds) from computers not using ATASCII will be nonsense on an Atari, and vice versa. Terminal programs need to translate between ATASCII and standard ASCII.

Some Atari-based BBSs exploited this difference by asking the client to hit the &quot;Return&quot; key. If it got 13 (ASCII CR), then standard ASCII would be used. If it got 155 (ATASCII CR) it would switch to ATASCII, allowing full use of the ATASCII graphic set. Some Atari BBSs would also block features (or even block access completely) for non-Atari users.

Text files encoded in ATASCII also need conversion to be viewed on modern PCs and &quot;vice versa&quot;—utilities are available to facilitate this.

==ATASCII animations==
The control codes in ATASCII are transmissible to other computers such as BBSs, and crude animations are possible. These animations, also known as &quot;break movies&quot;, often take the form of short cartoons, and were a popular feature of Atari BBSs in their heyday.

Because cursor control operations are represented with a single character (as opposed to multi-byte sequences that were common in other schemes, like ANSI or VT100), it is quite easy to make these animations. They can be created by a short BASIC program that captures keyboard commands, echoes them to the screen and saves them to a file. The Atari also allowed commands to be typed and captured as part of its operating system. Of course this required care to get it right, but after a few attempts it normally became quite easy. The simple capture programs didn&#x27;t have editing features, so ATASCII movies frequently had errors that were corrected by repositioning the cursor and printing over the mistake.

<doc id="560150" wikidata="Q642090" url="?curid=560150" title="Charles Somerset, 4th Duke of Beaufort">
<text>Charles Noel Somerset, 4th Duke of Beaufort (12 September 1709 – 28 October 1756) was a British Tory politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1731 until 1745 when he succeeded to the peerage as Duke of Beaufort.

==Life==
Somerset was the younger son of Henry Somerset, 2nd Duke of Beaufort and his second wife, Rachel Noel. He was educated at Winchester College and matriculated as University College, Oxford on 19 June 1725, being awarded MA on 16 October 1727.

Somerset was a High Tory and &#x27;a most determined and unwavering Jacobite.&#x27; He was returned as Member of Parliament for Monmouthshire his family&#x27;s seat at a by-election on 17 May 1731. At the 1734 British general election, he transferred to Monmouth. He adopted a traditional Tory line in Parliament, which included voting against the repeal of the Test Act in 1736; this demonstrates the complexity of the English Jacobite movement, which was staunchly anti-Catholic, yet in theory supported a Catholic monarchy.

Somerset was returned again for Monmouth at the 1741 British general election. The era was dominated by the Whigs under the premiership of Robert Walpole with the Tories excluded from power. In February 1742, Walpole was finally ousted by a coalition of Tories, Patriot Whigs who opposed his foreign policy and members of the &#x27;Prince&#x27;s Party,&#x27; a group of younger politicians, most notably William Pitt who associated themselves with Frederick, Prince of Wales. However, to the fury of their Tory allies, the Patriot Whigs did a deal with their Whig colleagues to shut them out of the new government, while in 1744, the Tory leader the Earl of Gower joined the so-called Broad Bottom ministry and Somerset assumed leadership of the party. However, the government simply ignored him and continued to treat Gower as the Tory leader when negotiating the award of offices.
Somerset became Duke of Beaufort on the death of his brother, Henry Scudamore, 3rd Duke of Beaufort in February 1745. He vacated his seat in the House of Commons and took his seat in the House of Lords. His brother had been one of those who contacted the French government in late 1742 asking for their support for an invasion to restore the Stuarts. Beaufort himself also joined the project, sending assurances of support to the French in August 1745, and pressing a month later ‘for a body of troops to be landed near London.&#x27; Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, executed for his part in the 45 Rebellion later declared ‘if the Duke of Beaufort had not promised to raise £12,000, he would not have concerned himself’ but as with many aristocratic Jacobite sympathisers, the Government took no action against Beaufort.

One of the complexities of 18th-century politics was the hostility between Hanoverian monarchs and their heirs; as George II supported the Whigs, his son Frederick, Prince of Wales described himself as a Tory even though many of them were in theory Jacobites. Since the Prince&#x27;s &#x27;programme&#x27; effectively amounted to ousting the current incumbents, Beaufort agreed to support him and in May 1749, Horace Walpole reported his presence at a meeting ‘between the Prince&#x27;s party and the Jacobites.&#x27; In September 1750, Beaufort and Lord Westmorland jointly presided at a meeting of English Jacobites held during Charles Stuart&#x27;s secret visit to London in September 1750, which effectively signalled the last flicker of the Jacobite movement.

Beaufort died on 28 October 1756 and was buried in the family vault at Badminton, Gloucestershire; a contemporary described him as &#x27;a man of sense, spirit and activity, unblameable in his morals, but questionable in his political capacity&#x27;. His wife Elizabeth died on 9 April 1799.

==Family==
On 1 May 1740, he married Elizabeth Berkeley, sister of Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt.

The couple had one son and five daughters:
# Lady Anne Somerset (11 March 1741 – 18 May 1763), married Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton on 13 September 1759 and had issue
# Lady Elizabeth Somerset (12 March 1742 – 7 May 1760)
# Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort (1744–1803), his heir and successor
# Lady Rachel Somerset (August 1746 – May 1747)
# Lady Henrietta Somerset (26 April 1748 – 24 July 1770), married Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 4th Baronet on 6 April 1769, without issue
# Lady Mary Isabella Somerset (1 August 1756 – 2 September 1831), married Charles Manners, 4th Duke of Rutland on 26 December 1775 and had issue

<doc id="560154" wikidata="Q2450598" url="?curid=560154" title="Infective endocarditis">
<text>Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart (endocardium), usually the valves. Signs and symptoms may include fever, small areas of bleeding into the skin, heart murmur, feeling tired, and low red blood cell count. Complications may include backward blood flow in the heart, heart failure – the heart struggling to pump a sufficient amount of blood to meet the body&#x27;s needs, abnormal electrical conduction in the heart, stroke, and kidney failure.
The cause is typically a bacterial infection and less commonly a fungal infection. Risk factors include valvular heart disease, including rheumatic disease, congenital heart disease, artificial valves, hemodialysis, intravenous drug use, and electronic pacemakers. The bacteria most commonly involved are streptococci or staphylococci. Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and supported by blood cultures or ultrasound of the heart. There is also a noninfective form of endocarditis.
The usefulness of antibiotics following dental procedures for prevention is unclear. Some recommend them for people at high risk. Treatment is generally with intravenous antibiotics. The choice of antibiotics is based on the results of blood cultures. Occasionally heart surgery is required.

The number of people affected is about 5 per 100,000 per year. Rates, however, vary between regions of the world. Infective endocarditis occurs in males more often than in females. The risk of death among those infected is about 25%. Without treatment, it is almost universally fatal. Improved diagnosis and treatment options have significantly enhanced the life expectancy of patients with infective endocarditis, particularly with congenital heart disease.
==Classification==
Infective endocarditis is divided into the three categories of acute, subacute, and chronic based on the duration of symptoms. Acute infective endocarditis refers to the presence of signs and symptoms of infective endocarditis that are present for days up to six weeks. If these signs and symptoms persist for more than six weeks but less than three months, this is subacute infective endocarditis. Chronic infective endocarditis refers to the presence of such signs and symptoms when they persist for more than three months.
* &quot;Subacute bacterial endocarditis&quot; (SBE) is often due to streptococci of low virulence (mainly viridans streptococci) and mild to moderate illness which progresses slowly over weeks and months (&gt;2 weeks) and has low propensity to hematogenously seed extracardiac sites.
* &quot;Acute bacterial endocarditis&quot; (ABE) is a fulminant illness over days to weeks (&lt;2 weeks), and is more likely due to &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, which has much greater virulence or disease-producing capacity and frequently causes metastatic infection.

This classification is now discouraged, because the ascribed associations (in terms of organism and prognosis) were not strong enough to be relied upon clinically. The terms &quot;short incubation&quot; (meaning less than about six weeks) and &quot;long incubation&quot; (greater than about six weeks) are preferred.

=== Culture results ===
Infective endocarditis may also be classified as &quot;culture-positive&quot; or &quot;culture-negative&quot;. By far the most common cause of &quot;culture-negative&quot; endocarditis is prior administration of antibiotics and can occur in up to 31% of cases.

Sometimes microorganisms can take a longer period of time to grow in the culture media, for example Cutibacterium spp. and the HACEK bacteria group. Some organisms are said to be &quot;fastidious&quot; because they have demanding growth requirements. Some examples include pathogens like &quot;Aspergillus&quot; species, &quot;Brucella&quot; species, &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot;, &quot;Chlamydia&quot; species. Due to delay in growth and identification in these cases, patients may be erroneously classified as &quot;culture-negative&quot; endocarditis.

=== Heart side ===
Endocarditis can also be classified by the side of the heart affected:
* People who intravenously inject opioids such as heroin or methamphetamine may introduce infection which can travel to the right side of the heart, classically affecting the tricuspid valve, and most often caused by &quot;S. aureus&quot;.
* Regardless of cause, left-sided endocarditis is the most common, while right-sided endocarditis accounts for 5-10% of cases and is more common in people who inject IV drugs and in patients with congenital heart disease.

=== Infection setting ===
Another form of endocarditis is healthcare-associated endocarditis when the infecting organism is believed to be transmitted in a health care setting like hospital, dialysis unit or a residential nursing home. Nosocomial endocarditis is a form of healthcare associated endocarditis in which the infective organism is acquired during a stay in a hospital and it is usually secondary to presence of intravenous catheters, total parenteral nutrition lines, pacemakers, etc.

=== Valve type ===
Finally, the distinction between &quot;native-valve endocarditis&quot; and &quot;prosthetic-valve endocarditis&quot; is clinically important. Prosthetic valve endocarditis can be early (within 1 year of surgery) or late (&gt; 1 year following valvular surgery).
* Early prosthetic valve endocarditis is usually due to intraoperative contamination or postoperative bacterial contamination which is usually nosocomial in nature.
* Late prosthetic valve endocarditis is usually due to community-acquired microorganisms.

Prosthetic valve endocarditis is commonly caused by &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot; as it is capable of growing as a biofilm on plastic surfaces. &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot; almost exclusively causes endocarditis on prosthetic heart valves.

==Signs and symptoms==
* Fever occurs in 97% of people; malaise and endurance fatigue in 90% of people.
* A new or changing heart murmur, weight loss, and coughing occurs in 35% of people.
* Vascular phenomena: septic embolism (a piece of infected debris or tissue breaking off and traveling through the bloodstream to a distant site) (causing thromboembolic problems such as a stroke or gangrene of the fingers), Janeway lesions (painless hemorrhagic cutaneous lesions on the palms and soles), bleeding in the brain, conjunctival hemorrhage, splinter hemorrhages, kidney infarcts, and splenic infarcts. Infective endocarditis can also lead to the formation of mycotic aneurysms.
* Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis which allows for blood and albumin to enter the urine, Osler&#x27;s nodes (&quot;ephemeral spots of a painful nodular erythema, chiefly in the skin of the hands and feet&quot;), Roth&#x27;s spots on the retina, positive serum rheumatoid factor
* Other signs may include night sweats, rigors, anemia, spleen enlargement

==Cause==
Many microorganisms can cause infective endocarditis. These are generally isolated by blood culture, where the patient&#x27;s blood is drawn and any growth is noted and identified. The term bacterial endocarditis (BE) commonly is used, reflecting the fact that most cases of IE are due to bacteria; however, infective endocarditis (IE) has become the preferred term.

===Bacterial===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is the leading cause of infective endocarditis in most parts of the world and is responsible for about 31% of cases. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of endocarditis in people who use intravenous drugs. Viridans streptococci and Enterococci are the second and third most common organisms responsible for infective endocarditis. Viridans streptococci are a common cause of infective endocarditis in South America. Other &quot;Streptococci&quot; are also a frequent cause. Infective endocarditis due to &quot;Streptococcus bovis&quot; occurs more commonly in Europe than in North America. HACEK group of bacteria are also rare causes of infective endocarditis in North America.

The viridans group includes &quot;S. oralis&quot;, &quot;S. mitis&quot;, &quot;S. sanguis&quot;, &quot;S. gordonii&quot; and &quot;S. parasanguis&quot;. The primary habitats for these organisms are the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract. These bacteria are present in the normal oral flora and enter the bloodstream due to disruption of tissues in the mouth when dental surgical procedures are performed (tooth extractions) or genitourinary manipulation. Similarly, HACEK organisms are a group of bacteria that live on the dental gums and can be seen with people who inject drugs who contaminate their needles with saliva. Patients may also have a history of poor dental hygiene or pre-existing valvular disease.

Viridans alpha-hemolytic &quot;streptococci&quot;, that are present in the mouth, are the most frequently isolated microorganisms when the infection is acquired in a community setting. In contrast, &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; bloodstream infections are frequently acquired in a health care setting where they can enter the bloodstream through procedures that cause breaks in the integrity of skin, such as surgery, catheterization, or during access of long term indwelling catheters or secondary to intravenous injection of recreational drugs.

&quot;Enterococcus&quot; can enter the bloodstream as a consequence of abnormalities in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tracts.

Some organisms, when isolated, give valuable clues to the cause, as they tend to be specific.
* &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; species, which are very resilient organisms that thrive in water, may contaminate street drugs that have been contaminated with drinking water. &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; can infect a child through foot punctures, and can cause both endocarditis and septic arthritis.
* &quot;S. bovis&quot; and &quot;Clostridium septicum&quot;, which are part of the natural flora of the bowel, are associated with colon cancers. When they present as the causative agent in endocarditis, it usually prompts a colonoscopy to be done immediately due to concerns regarding spread of bacteria from the colon through the bloodstream due to the cancer breaking down the barrier between the inside of the colon (lumen) and the blood vessels which drain the bowel.
* Less commonly reported bacteria responsible for so called &quot;culture negative endocarditis&quot; include &quot;Bartonella&quot;, &quot;Chlamydia psittaci&quot;, and &quot;Coxiella&quot;. Such bacteria can be identified by serology, culture of the excised valve tissue, sputum, pleural fluid, and emboli, and by polymerase chain reaction or sequencing of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA.

Multiple case reports of infective endocarditis caused by unusual organisms have been published. &quot;Cutibacterium&quot; spp., which are normal skin flora, have been responsible for infective endocarditis, preferably in patients with prosthetic heart valves, in rare cases leading to death.&quot;Tropheryma whipplei&quot; has caused endocarditis without gastrointestinal involvement. &quot;Citrobacter koseri&quot; was found in an immunocompetent adult. &quot;Neisseria bacilliformis&quot; was found in a person with a bicuspid aortic valve.

====Dental operations====
One in eight cases of infective endocarditis is thought to be caused by S. viridans infection associated with dental procedures such as cleaning or tooth extraction. This was thought to be more clinically significant than it is. However, it is important that a dentist or a dental hygienist be told of any heart problems before commencing treatment. Prophylactic antibiotics were regularly administered to patients with certain heart conditions as a precaution, although this practice has changed in the US, with new American Heart Association guidelines released in 2007, and in the UK as of March 2008 due to new NICE guidelines.

===Fungal===
Fungal endocarditis (FE) is often fatal and one of the most serious forms of infective endocarditis. The types of fungi most seen associated with this disease are:

&quot;Candida albicans&quot; is found as a spherical or oval budding yeast. It is associated with endocarditis in people who inject drugs, patients with prosthetic valves, and immunocompromised patients. It forms biofilms around thick-walled resting structures like prosthetic heart valves and additionally colonizes and penetrates endothelial walls. C. albicans is responsible for 24-46% of all the cases of FE, and its mortality rate is 46.6–50%.

Other fungi demonstrated to cause endocarditis are &quot;Histoplasma capsulatum&quot; and Aspergillus. Aspergillus contributes to roughly 25% of FE cases. Endocarditis with &quot;Tricosporon asahii&quot; has also been reported in a case report.

===Risk factors===
Risk factors for infective endocarditis are based on the premise that in a healthy individual, bacteremia (bacteria entering the bloodstream) is cleared quickly with no adverse consequences. However, if a heart valve is damaged, the bacteria can attach themselves to the valve, resulting in infective endocarditis. Additionally, in individuals with weakened immune systems, the concentration of bacteria in the blood can reach levels high enough to increase the probability that some will attach to the valve. Some significant risk factors are listed here:
* Artificial heart valves
* Intracardiac devices, such as implantable cardioverter-defibrillators
* Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart defects
* History of infective endocarditis
* Neoplastic disease
* Chronic rheumatic heart disease, which is an autoimmune response to repeated &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; infection (mostly in the developing world)
* Age-related degenerative valvular lesions
* Congenital heart valve abnormalities
* Hemodialysis, a medical procedure that filters the blood of individuals with kidney failure
* Poor oral hygiene
* IVDU (IV drug user)
* Co-existing immunosuppressing conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, chronic liver disease, and HIV/AIDS

==Pathogenesis==

Damaged valves and endocardium contribute to the development of infective endocarditis. Specifically, the damaged part of a heart valve forms a local blood clot, a condition known as non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). The platelet and fibrin deposits that form as part of the blood clotting process allow bacteria to take hold and form vegetations. As previously mentioned, the body has no direct methods of combating valvular vegetations because the valves do not have a dedicated blood supply. This combination of damaged valves, bacterial growth, and lack of a strong immune response results in infective endocarditis.

Damage to the valves and endocardium can be caused by:
* Altered, turbulent blood flow. The areas that fibrose, clot, or roughen as a result of this altered flow are known as jet lesions. Altered blood flow is more likely in high pressure areas, so ventricular septal defects or patent ductus arteriosus can create more susceptibility than atrial septal defects.
* Catheters, electrodes, and other intracardiac prosthetic devices.
* Solid particles from repeated intravenous injections.
* Chronic inflammation. Examples include auto-immune mechanisms and degenerative valvular lesions.
The risk factors for infective endocarditis provide a more extensive list of conditions that can damage the heart.

==Diagnosis==
In general, the Duke criteria should be fulfilled in order to establish the diagnosis of endocarditis. Although the Duke criteria are widely used, they have significant limitations. For example, the sensitivity of the Duke criteria for detecting infective endocarditis decreases when prosthetic heart valves are present.

As the Duke criteria rely heavily on the results of echocardiography, research has addressed when to order an echocardiogram by using signs and symptoms to predict occult endocarditis among people who inject drugs and among non drug-abusing patients. However, this research is over twenty years old and it is possible that changes in the epidemiology of endocarditis and bacteria such as staphylococci make the following estimates incorrect.

The blood tests C reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin have not been found to be particularly useful in helping make or rule out the diagnosis.

===Ultrasound===
Echocardiography is the main type of diagnostic imaging used to establish the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. There are two main types of echocardiography used to assist with the diagnosis of IE: transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

The transthoracic echocardiogram has a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 65% and 95% if the echocardiographer believes there is &#x27;probable&#x27; or &#x27;almost certain&#x27; evidence of endocarditis. However, in endocarditis involving a prosthetic valve, TTE has a sensitivity of approximately 50%, whereas TEE has a sensitivity exceeding 90%. The TEE also has an important diagnostic role when the TTE does not reveal IE but diagnostic suspicion remains high, since TEE is more sensitive for infective endocarditis and is better able to characterize infection-related damage to the heart valves and surrounding tissues.

Guidelines support the initial use of TTE over TEE in people with abnormal blood cultures, a new heart murmur, and suspected infective endocarditis. TEE is the preferred initial form of imaging in people with suspected infective endocarditis who have a moderate to high pretest probability of infective endocarditis, including people with prosthetic heart valves, blood cultures growing &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, or have an intracardiac device (such as a pacemaker).

===Modified Duke criteria===
Established in 1994 by the Duke Endocarditis Service and revised in 2000, the Duke criteria are a collection of major and minor criteria used to establish a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. According to the Duke criteria, diagnosis of infective endocarditis can be definite, possible, or rejected. A diagnosis of infective endocarditis is definite if either the following pathological &quot;or&quot; clinical criteria are met:

One of these pathological criteria:
* Histology or culture of cardiac vegetation, embolized vegetation, or intracardiac abscess from the heart finds microorganisms
* Active endocarditis
One of these combinations of clinical criteria
* Two major clinical criteria
* One major and three minor criteria
* Five minor criteria
Diagnosis of infective endocarditis is possible if one of the following combinations of clinical criteria is met:
* One major and one minor criteria
* Three minor criteria are fulfilled

====Major criteria====
Positive blood culture with typical IE microorganism, defined as one of the following:
* Typical microorganism consistent with IE from two separate blood cultures, as noted below:
** Viridans-group streptococci, or
** &quot;Streptococcus bovis&quot; including nutritional variant strains, or
** HACEK group, or
** &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, or
** Community-acquired &quot;enterococci&quot;, in the absence of a primary focus
* Microorganisms consistent with IE from persistently positive blood cultures defined as:
** Two positive cultures of blood samples drawn &gt;12 hours apart, or
** Three or a majority of ≥four separate blood cultures (with first and last sample drawn at least one hour apart)
** &quot;Coxiella burnetii&quot; detected by at least one positive blood culture or IgG antibody titer for Q fever phase 1 antigen &gt;1:800. This was previously a minor criterion
Evidence of endocardial involvement with positive echocardiogram is defined as
* Oscillating intracardiac mass on valve or supporting structures, in the path of regurgitant jets, or on implanted material in the absence of an alternative anatomic explanation, or
* Abscess, or
* New partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve or new valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing of preexisting murmur not sufficient)

====Minor criteria====
* Predisposing factor: known cardiac lesion, recreational drug injection
* Fever &gt;38 °C
* Vascular phenomena: arterial emboli, pulmonary infarcts, Janeway lesions, conjunctival hemorrhage
* Immunological phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler&#x27;s nodes, Roth&#x27;s spots, Rheumatoid factor
* Microbiologic evidence: Positive blood culture (that doesn&#x27;t meet a major criterion) or serologic evidence of infection with organism consistent with IE but not satisfying major criterion
Updated (2023) Modified Duke Criteria for Infective Endocarditis: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a life-threatening condition and the Duke criteria (established in 1994 and revised in 2000) has been fundamental for the diagnosis of the disease. However, the landscape of micro-biology, diagnostics, epidemiology, and treatment for lE has evolved significantly over the years. The 2023 modified Duke criteria address these changes: Updated (2023) Modified Duke Criteria for Infective Endocarditis

===Risk===
Among people who do not use intravenous drugs and have a fever in the emergency department, there is a less than 5% chance of occult endocarditis. Mellors in 1987 found no cases of endocarditis nor of staphylococcal bacteremia among 135 febrile patients &quot;in the emergency room&quot;. The upper confidence interval for 0% of 135 is 5%, so for statistical reasons alone, there is up to a 5% chance of endocarditis among these patients. In contrast, Leibovici found that among 113 non-selected adults &quot;admitted to the hospital&quot; because of fever there were two cases (1.8% with 95%CI: 0% to 7%) of endocarditis.

Among people who do use intravenous drugs and have a fever in the emergency department, there is about a 10% to 15% prevalence of endocarditis. This estimate is not substantially changed by whether the doctor believes the patient has a trivial explanation for their fever. Weisse found that 13% of 121 patients had endocarditis. Marantz also found a prevalence of endocarditis of 13% among such patients in the emergency department with fever. Samet found a 6% incidence among 283 such patients, but after excluding patients with initially apparent major illness to explain the fever (including 11 cases of manifest endocarditis), there was a 7% prevalence of endocarditis. During the Opioid epidemic in the United States, hospitals observed an increase in stroke associated with infective endocarditis.

Among people with staphylococcal bacteremia (SAB), one study found a 29% prevalence of endocarditis in community-acquired SAB versus 5% in nosocomial SAB. However, only 2% of strains were resistant to methicillin and so these numbers may be low in areas of higher resistance.

==Prevention==
Not all people with heart disease require antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis. Heart diseases have been classified into high, medium and low risk of developing IE. Those falling into high risk category require IE prophylaxis before endoscopies and urinary tract procedures.
Diseases listed under high risk include:
* Prior endocarditis
* Unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart diseases
* Completely repaired congenital heart disease in their first 6 months
* Prosthetic heart valves or valves repaired with any prosthetic material
* Incompletely repaired congenital heart diseases
* Cardiac transplant valvulopathy

Following are the antibiotic regimens recommended by the American Heart Association for antibiotic prophylaxis:
: Oral amoxicillin one hour before the procedure
: Intravenous or intramuscular ampicillin one hour before the procedure
:In patients allergic to penicillins
:: Azithromycin or clarithromycin orally one hour before the procedure
:: Cephalexin orally one hour before the procedure
:: Clindamycin orally one hour before the procedure

In the UK, NICE clinical guidelines no longer advise prophylaxis because there is no clinical evidence that it reduces the incidence of IE and there are negative effects (e.g. allergy and increased bacterial resistance) of taking antibiotics that may outweigh the benefits.

Antibiotics were historically commonly recommended to prevent IE in those with heart problems undergoing dental procedures (known as dental antibiotic prophylaxis). There is, however, insufficient evidence to support whether antibiotics are effective or ineffective at preventing IE when given prior to a dental procedures in people at high risk. They are less commonly recommended for this procedure.

In some countries e.g. the US, high risk patients may be given prophylactic antibiotics such as penicillin or clindamycin for penicillin-allergic people prior to dental procedures. Prophylactics should be bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic. Such measures are not taken in certain countries e.g. Scotland due to the fear of antibiotic resistance. Because bacteria are the most common cause of infective endocarditis, antibiotics such as penicillin and amoxicillin (for beta lactamase-producing bacteria) are used in prophylaxis.

==Treatment==
High-dose antibiotics are the cornerstone of treatment for infective endocarditis. These antibiotics are administered by the intravenous (IV) route to maximize diffusion of antibiotic molecules into vegetation(s) from the blood filling the chambers of the heart. This is necessary because neither the heart valves nor the vegetations adhering to them are supplied by blood vessels. Antibiotics are typically continued for two to six weeks depending on the characteristics of the infection and the causative microorganisms. Antibiotic treatment lowers the risk of embolic complications in people with infective endocarditis.

In acute endocarditis, due to the fulminant inflammation, empirical antibiotic therapy is started immediately after the blood has been drawn for culture to clarify the bacterial organisms responsible for the infection. This usually includes vancomycin and ceftriaxone IV infusions until the infecting organism is identified and the susceptibility report with the minimum inhibitory concentration becomes available. Once this information is available, this allows the supervising healthcare professional to modify the antimicrobial therapy to target the specific infecting microorganism. The routine use of gentamicin to treat endocarditis has fallen out of favor due to the lack of evidence to support its use (except in infections caused by &quot;Enterococcus&quot; and nutritionally variant &quot;streptococci&quot;) and the high rate of complications. In cases of subacute endocarditis, where the person&#x27;s hemodynamic status is usually stable, antibiotic treatment can be delayed until the causative microorganism can be identified.

Viridans group &quot;streptococci&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus bovis&quot; are usually highly susceptible to penicillin and can be treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone. Relatively resistant strains of viridans group &quot;streptococci&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus bovis&quot; are treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone along with a shorter two-week course of an aminoglycoside during the initial phase of treatment. Highly penicillin-resistant strains of viridans group &quot;streptococci&quot;, nutritionally variant &quot;streptococci&quot; like &quot;Granulicatella sp.&quot;, &quot;Gemella sp.&quot;, &quot;Abiotrophia defectiva&quot;, and &quot;Enterococci&quot; are usually treated with a combination therapy consisting of penicillin and an aminoglycoside for the entire duration of 4–6 weeks.

Some people may be treated with a relatively shorter course of treatment (two weeks) with benzyl penicillin IV if infection is caused by viridans group &quot;streptococci&quot; or &quot;Streptococcus bovis&quot; as long as the following conditions are met:
* Endocarditis of a native valve, not of a prosthetic valve
* A MIC ≤ 0.12 mg/l
* No complication such as heart failure, arrhythmia, or pulmonary embolism occurs
* No evidence of extracardiac complication like septic thromboembolism
* No vegetations &gt; 5 mm in diameter conduction defects
* Rapid clinical response and clearance of bloodstream infection

Additionally, oxacillin-susceptible &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; native valve endocarditis of the right side can also be treated with a short 2-week course of a beta-lactam antibiotic such as nafcillin with or without aminoglycosides.
The main indication for surgical treatment is regurgitation or stenosis. In active infective endocarditis, the surgery should remove enough leaflet tissue to ensure eradication of the infectious process. Subsequent valve repair can be performed in limited disease. Replacement of the valve with a mechanical or bioprosthetic artificial heart valve is necessary in certain situations:
* Patients with significant valve stenosis or regurgitation causing heart failure
* Evidence of hemodynamic compromise in the form of elevated end-diastolic left ventricular or left atrial pressure or moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension
* Presence of intracardiac complications like paravalvular abscess, conduction defects or destructive penetrating lesions
* Recurrent septic emboli despite appropriate antibiotic treatment
* Large vegetations (&gt; 10 mm)
* Persistently positive blood cultures despite appropriate antibiotic treatment
* Prosthetic valve dehiscence
* Relapsing infection in the presence of a prosthetic valve
* Abscess formation
* Early closure of mitral valve
* Infection caused by fungi or resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

The guidelines were recently updated by both the American College of Cardiology and the European Society of Cardiology. There was a recent meta-analysis published that showed surgical intervention at seven days or less is associated with lower mortality.

==Prognosis==
Infective endocarditis is associated with 18% in-hospital mortality. However, adult patients with congenital heart disease can have relatively lower mortality down to 5% due to younger age, right-sided endocarditis and management by multidisciplinary teams. As many as 50% of people with infective endocarditis may experience embolic complications.

==Epidemiology==
In developed countries, the annual incidence of infective endocarditis is 3 to 9 cases per 100,000 persons. Infective endocarditis occurs more often in men than in women. There is an increased incidence of infective endocarditis in persons 65 years of age and older, which is probably because people in this age group have a larger number of risk factors for infective endocarditis. In recent years, over one-third of infective endocarditis cases in the United States was healthcare-associated. Another trend observed in developed countries is that chronic rheumatic heart disease accounts for less than 10% of cases. Although a history of valve disease has a significant association with infective endocarditis, 50% of all cases develop in people with no known history of valvular disease.

==History==

Lazare Riviére first described infective endocarditis affecting the aortic valve in 1616. In 1806, Jean-Nicolas Corvisart coined the term &quot;vegetation&quot; to describe collections of debris found on a mitral valve affected by infective endocarditis. The British physician Joseph Hodgson was the first to describe the embolic complications of infective endocarditis in 1815. It was not until 1878 that Theodor Klebs first suggested that infective endocarditis had a microbial infectious origin. In 1909, William Osler noted that heart valves that experienced degeneration and were sclerotic or poorly functioning had a higher risk of being affected. Later, in 1924, Emanuel Libman and Benjamin Sacks described cases of vegetative endocarditis that lacked a clear microbial origin and were often associated with the autoimmune condition systemic lupus erythematosus. In 1944, physicians reported on the first successful use of penicillin to treat a case of infective endocarditis.

<text>CHWI-DT (channel 16) is a television station licensed to Wheatley, Ontario, Canada, broadcasting CTV 2 programming to the Windsor area. Owned and operated by Bell Media, the station has studios at the Bell Canada Building in downtown Windsor with a secondary office in Chatham; its primary transmitter is located on Zion Road (between Concession Line Roads 4 and 5) in Chatham, with a rebroadcaster atop Victoria Park Place in downtown Windsor.

CHWI was built by Baton Broadcasting in 1993 following its purchase of CFPL-TV in London. Signing on October 18, 1993, it provided Windsor its first dedicated local TV newscasts since 1990, though the newscasts were presented from London. The main transmitter, sited near Wheatley to avoid programming restrictions related to Windsor&#x27;s proximity with Detroit, was supplemented with a rebroadcaster in downtown Windsor in 1995. As Baton sought to control the CTV Television Network, it traded CHWI-TV and other stations to CHUM Limited in 1997. Beginning the next year, the station was branded &quot;The New WI&quot; as part of CHUM&#x27;s NewNet regional system, which mostly consisted of secondary stations in Ontario. Its local newscasts came to dominate the ratings in Windsor, particularly after a 1999 strike at CBC station CBET.

NewNet was renamed A-Channel in 2005 and then A in 2008 after its purchase by CTVglobemedia, predecessor to Bell Media. Citing a difficult economic environment and federal refusal to let TV stations charge cable systems for carriage, CTV declared its intention to shut CHWI-TV down in 2009 but reversed its decision in light of increased federal support and lobbying by local politicians. A was renamed CTV Two in 2011, with its local newscasts coming under the &quot;CTV News&quot; banner. The station offers weeknight newscasts covering Windsor and Chatham.

==The Baton years==
In May 1992, Baton Broadcasting agreed to purchase two television stations in southwestern Ontario: CFPL-TV in London and CKNX-TV in Wingham from The Blackburn Group. For Baton, the transaction gave the company additional regional muscle as it sought to compete with the Global Television Network. Three months later, Baton applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to build a third television station, primarily a rebroadcaster of CFPL-TV, near Wheatley to serve Windsor and Chatham. The new Wheatley transmitter, on channel 16, would air up to hours of locally-oriented programming a week, including a local newscast, produced from London for the Windsor–Chatham area. The new station, given the call sign CHWI-TV, would be an affiliate of Baton&#x27;s regional Ontario Network Television system and carry Toronto Blue Jays baseball. This influenced the decision to set up the main transmitter at Wheatley, which was outside the protection radius from Detroit where the Detroit Tigers had blackout rights; CBET (channel 9), located in Windsor proper, was affected by the blackout rules.

The news component was the portion that attracted the most interest. Windsor had been without a local television newscast since December 1990, when the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) discontinued the local news on CBET. In a letter to the CRTC, Windsor mayor Mike Hurst supported the Baton bid; though he expressed concern over the signal strength that CHWI-TV would provide Windsor from Wheatley, he called it a starting point for the restoration of local television news service. The local programming proposed by Baton included a 6 p.m. newscast on weeknights; a half-hour news and community affairs program in midday; and two weekly public affairs shows.

The CRTC approved the construction of CHWI-TV on January 26, 1993, days after the Wheatley transmitter site was approved by Romney Township officials; Baton promised to have the station operational by January 1994. For the company, it was a return to Windsor; Baton had been forced to sell channel 9, previously private commercial station CKLW-TV, to the CBC in 1975, but held on to the CKLW radio stations until 1985. In spite of the 1994 projections, Baton was able to speed construction, Transmitter testing began September 1, providing Windsor with a similar picture quality to the Global repeater at Stevenson, and a Grade-A contour in areas such as Chatham and Leamington.

CHWI-TV began broadcasting on October 18, 1993. The local newscasts at 6 and 11 p.m., originally titled &quot;News Now&quot; like that of CFPL-TV, debuted the same day from a separate studio in London. In Windsor, the station had offices at Goyeau Street and Riverside Drive, housing a studio for inserts into the newscasts, and 14 people in the newsroom, plus two more in Chatham. In its first ratings survey, CHWI&#x27;s &quot;News Now&quot; came in third, just behind CBET with the news from CKCO in Kitchener. CKCO, which had been the main source of television news coverage about Windsor after the 1990 CBET cuts and maintained a news bureau there, soon cut back its presence in light of the entrance of CHWI, the 1994 relaunch of local news by CBET, and a cooperative ad sales relationship between Baton and the CBC; in late 1995, the news bureau was closed altogether. By late 1994, CHWI was second at 6 p.m. to the CBC Toronto early evening news, and by early 1997 it had almost as many viewers as CBET&#x27;s 5:30 p.m. &quot;Windsor Evening News&quot;.

Reception from the Wheatley transmitter site proved to be an issue in the Windsor city centre, and many television antennas in this area were aimed northwest toward Southfield, Michigan, where most Detroit TV stations have their towers. In August 1994, Baton applied to the CRTC for authority to build a rebroadcaster on channel 6 atop the Victoria Park Place condominium, which already housed the microwave transmission link between Windsor and London. The proposed service was directional toward the southeast to avoid signal coverage in Detroit. The new transmitter went on—using channel 60 instead of 6—on July 26, 1995, providing the core Windsor area with coverage despite an effective radiated power of 580 watts. Later, in 2000, the Windsor transmitter was authorized to increase its power tenfold to 5,800 watts.

In 1997, Baton conducted a round of layoffs at its Ontario stations. Three employees were dismissed at CHWI-TV, while the station lost its shared midday show with CFPL.

==CHUM ownership: The New WI and A-Channel==

Through the mid-1990s, Baton Broadcasting worked to consolidate its control of the CTV Television Network. On February 25, 1997, it exchanged television stations with CHUM Limited. With its acquisition of ATV, it gained majority control of CTV. In exchange, CHUM received a series of secondary stations in Ontario that were redundant to the CTV network: CFPL-TV, CKNX-TV, CHWI-TV, and CHRO-TV serving Pembroke and Ottawa. It expected the stations to fit well with CKVR-TV &quot;The New VR&quot; in Barrie as well as with all four private radio stations in Windsor, which it owned. The makeover of CHWI-TV began in September 1997, when CFPL, CKNX, and CHWI adopted CHUM&#x27;s primetime schedule and began gradually altering their local programming over a two-month period. The 6 p.m. &quot;News Now&quot; was joined by a new regional 5:30 newscast, &quot;First Look&quot;, while late night sportscasts were reformatted in a style reminiscent of CHUM-owned Citytv&#x27;s news. Newscasts were a particular point of emphasis for improvement in the reformatting of the stations. In September 1998, the three stations were rebranded, with CHWI becoming &quot;The New WI&quot; and CHUM promising that someday its newscast would originate from Windsor, not London.

On September 1, 1999, CHWI relocated from its original studios at Riverside and Goyeau to a higher-visibility downtown location at 300 Ouellette Avenue, occupying a former Laurentian Bank. A month later, it and CFPL debuted a shared morning show, &quot;New Day&quot;, with roughly half the program originating from Windsor and the other half from London. &quot;New Day&quot; debuted to an average audience of 500 but grew that to 2,800 within a year.

CBET endured a technician&#x27;s strike in February and March 1999 and did not have local news for two months; channel 9&#x27;s audience fell by nearly 40 percent, and CHWI made significant ratings inroads, particularly in Windsor itself, to become southwestern Ontario&#x27;s most-watched local newscast. Even though CBET moved its local news to 6 p.m. in October 2000 when &quot;Canada Now&quot; debuted, by 2005 CHWI had twice as many viewers in the same time slot. In June 2003, the news portion of CHWI&#x27;s newscasts began to originate from Windsor, though weather and sports continued to be presented from London.

As a result of CHUM&#x27;s acquisition of Craig Media (and its rebranding of a series of stations in Western Canada as Citytv stations on the same day), the NewNet stations (including CHWI-TV) were rebranded as A-Channel in August 2005. This allowed for increased cross-promotion and brand sharing.

== CTV ownership ==
On July 12, 2006, Bell Globemedia (later known as CTVglobemedia and now Bell Media) announced plans to take over CHUM Limited for . On June 8, 2007, the CRTC announced its approval of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s purchase of CHUM Limited, but the commission added a condition that CTVglobemedia must sell off CHUM&#x27;s Citytv stations to another buyer while allowing it to retain the A-Channel stations. Speculation of a rebrand for the A-Channel group followed the purchase, and in 2008, the system was renamed A.

=== Closure threat ===
Less than a year after the rebrand, CTV announced its intention to shut down CHWI-TV and CKNX-TV when their licence terms expired at the end of August 2009. Calling them the two smallest A stations, CTVglobemedia leadership cited the impacts of the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the CRTC&#x27;s decision not to allow a fee-for-carriage policy by which local stations could charge cable systems for the right to provide their signals. Even though both stations were losing money for CTV—in the case of CHWI-TV, it had run deficits for ten years—CTV had been reluctant to shutter the Windsor station because of its strong local news ratings. The news was very poorly received by Windsor viewers; Bruce Demara of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; called the decision &quot;puzzling&quot;, citing CHWI&#x27;s news ratings dominance. Local, provincial, and federal politicians representing Windsor, from the Windsor City Council and provincial MPs Sandra Pupatello and Dwight Duncan to federal MPs Brian Masse and Joe Comartin, lobbied CTVglobemedia to keep CHWI on the air, citing the unique circumstances in Windsor television and the predominance of American media in the market.

It appeared for a time that a sale would keep the station on the air. Shaw Communications agreed on April 30, 2009, to buy CHWI-TV, CKNX-TV, and CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba, for one dollar each, pending CRTC approval. However, Shaw backed out of the transaction on June 30, 2009—reportedly after reviewing the financial details of the properties to be acquired—once again putting the stations&#x27; futures in doubt. On July 6, 2009, the CRTC announced decisions to bolster the availability of local program funding and consider a fee-for-carriage model, prompting CTVglobemedia to &quot;review&quot; its plans for CHWI. Two days later, CTV announced the station would remain on the air for at least another year, making CHWI-TV the only station to fully survive the cuts as CKNX-TV was converted to rebroadcast CFPL-TV.

=== Bell Media era ===

In 2011, Bell Canada acquired full control of CTVglobemedia and restructured the company as Bell Media. One month later, Bell revealed that the A system, including CHWI, would be relaunched as CTV Two beginning with the 2011–12 television season. Alongside the relaunch came the rebranding of CHWI&#x27;s newscasts as &quot;CTV News Windsor&quot; and the establishment of a high-definition feed for its new digital signal.

In April 2013, Bell Media announced that the station would move to newly constructed facilities at the Bell Canada Building on Goyeau Street; the move came shortly after the &quot;Windsor Star&quot; newspaper moved into offices elsewhere in the Ouellette Street structure and increased utilization of the 1923-vintage structure, which had two empty floors. After relocating, CHWI began producing local 6 p.m. weekend newscasts in January 2014, replacing regional newscasts produced by CFPL. These were scrapped in February 2024 as part of a nearly network-wide discontinuation of weekend newscasts.

== Technical information ==

CHWI-DT is broadcast from two transmitters: a primary transmitter near Wheatley, Ontario, that covers Chatham-Kent and most of rural Essex County and a rebroadcaster in downtown Windsor.

On August 31, 2011, when Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts, CHWI-TV flash cut its digital signal into operation, using its former UHF analog channels 16 and 26. The Windsor transmitter had just been switched from channel 60 the previous January in order to clear the upper UHF band.

As part of the 600 MHz spectrum auction mandated by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, on April 29, 2019, CHWI-DT-60 moved from channel 26 to channel 17.

<doc id="560164" wikidata="Q3630843" url="?curid=560164" title="Doosra">
<text>A doosra is a particular type of delivery by an off-spin bowler in cricket. The doosra spins in the opposite direction to an off break (the off-spinner&#x27;s default delivery), and aims to confuse the batter into playing an unavoidable shot.

&quot;Doosra&quot; means &quot;(the) second (one)&quot;, or &quot;(the) other (one)&quot; in Hindi-Urdu.

The delivery was invented by Pakistani domestic cricketer Prince Aslam Khan and popularised by Pakistani international cricketer Saqlain Mushtaq. A variety of bowlers have made considerable use of the doosra in international cricket. Users include Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan, Indian Harbhajan Singh, and South African Johan Botha. Other Pakistanis who use it include Shoaib Malik and Saeed Ajmal. Many bowlers, such as Johan Botha and Shane Shillingford, are not allowed to bowl doosras because, when they do so, their bowling actions are considered illegal. Muralitharan&#x27;s use of the delivery led to a significant change in the laws of cricket that expanded the ability of bowlers to bend their arm by relaxing the throwing law.

== History ==
The doosra is a relatively new type of delivery. The naming of the delivery is attributed to Moin Khan, the former Pakistani wicketkeeper, who would call on Saqlain Mushtaq to bowl the &quot;doosra&quot; (the other one) from behind the stumps. Tony Greig, a commentator in one of these matches, eventually linked the word to the delivery and confirmed it with Saqlain in a post-match interview. Thus the term became a part of cricketing culture. The doosra is now an important part of the off-spin armoury.

== Technique ==
The bowler delivers the ball with the same wrist action by locking the wrist and using the index and ring fingers instead of the usual index and middle fingers. This gives the ball spin in the opposite direction to that for an off break, causing it to spin from the leg side to the off side to a right-handed batsman.

To make doosra more effective it should be pitched on the middle and off stump line because the ball will move away from the batsman after pitching, if a right-hander is facing the ball. However, if there is a little extra turn in the wicket then a bowler might have to adjust his line to middle and leg stump. An adept doosra bowler often gives a flight to his ball inviting a batsman to step out the crease, whereas the latter thinks that it is a traditional off-spin ball and he leaves the safety of the crease and loses his wicket to stumping or just manages to edge it to a fielder within the 30-yard circle.

The doosra is the off-spinner&#x27;s equivalent of the leg-spinner&#x27;s googly, which spins in the opposite direction to the leg spinner&#x27;s stock ball.

It is possible for a left-armer (whose action mirrors that of an off-spinner) to bowl the doosra, which in this case would turn from off to leg. Sri Lankan left-armer Rangana Herath gained recognition by bowling the delivery, in particular against the Australians during an A tour. England left-armer Monty Panesar has said he has bowled the delivery occasionally in domestic matches. In the test series against Sri Lanka in 2014, the English spin bowler Moeen Ali bowled a doosra making him the first English spinner to do so in an international match.

== Controversy ==
While Saqlain never had legitimacy issues regarding his action, other off-spinners attempting to utilize the delivery have had accusations (for the most part dismissed) of chucking (throwing) levelled against them. These include Sohag Gazi, Muttiah Muralitharan, Harbhajan Singh, Shoaib Malik, Saeed Ajmal and Johan Botha. The South Australian Dan Cullen has also been rumoured to be able to bowl the doosra.

=== Muttiah Muralitharan ===

Muralitharan&#x27;s doosra was the subject of an official report by match referee Chris Broad during Australia&#x27;s tour of Sri Lanka in 2004, for illegal bending of the arm at the elbow during the bowling action. Subsequent biomechanical tests conducted at the University of Western Australia in Perth showed that Muralitharan was straightening his arm by angles of up to 10 degrees prior to delivering doosras, well outside the International Cricket Council (ICC) acceptable guideline of 5 degrees for spin bowlers. (Straightening the bent arm at the moment of delivery imparts added ball speed due to the action of the triceps muscle: this is one of the ways baseball pitchers generate ball velocity.) Muralitharan was subsequently instructed by Sri Lanka Cricket not to bowl the doosra in international cricket. In November 2004, the International Cricket Council conducted more research into illegal bowling actions and found that many great bowlers like Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Shaun Pollock, whose actions were considered legitimate, were actually transgressing the 5 degree guideline. A rule change was proposed and accepted at a meeting of ICC chief executives in early 2005, stating that any bowler may straighten the arm up to 15° (which was earlier 9° for spinners and 12° for seamers) and Muralitharan&#x27;s doosra once again became a legal delivery.

In February 2006, in an attempt to silence the Australian crowds and their &quot;no ball&quot; chants, Muralitharan took another test at the University of Western Australia, which saw all of his deliveries deemed legal under the new relaxed definition including the doosra which was changed to accommodate not only him but 99% bowlers at the time.

=== Harbhajan Singh ===

The doosra of Indian bowler Harbhajan Singh was the subject of an official report by match referee Chris Broad, on-field umpires Aleem Dar and Mark Benson, and TV umpire Mahbubur Rahman after the second Test between India and Bangladesh at Chittagong in December 2004. It was reported that his arm is straightened by angles of up to 10 degrees, 5 degrees within the new ICC tolerance levels.

=== Shoaib Malik ===
Pakistani all-rounder Shoaib Malik was also reported for his doosra before the first Test between Australia and Pakistan in December 2004. Biomechanics tests, similar to those performed on Muralitharan, were conducted, and he did not bowl in subsequent Tests in that series. Unlike many other cricketers accused of throwing when bowling their doosra delivery, Malik is also a capable batsman, and some analysts speculate that he might focus on his batting if prevented from bowling this delivery.

Malik returned to bowling in May 2005 following remedial work. He was reported again, alongside Shabbir Ahmed, after the first Test against England at Multan in November 2005.

In May 2006, Malik opted for elbow surgery to correct his bowling action. He and the Pakistan Cricket Board had previously unsuccessfully argued that a 2003 road accident caused the damage to his elbow which makes his action appear suspect. Malik returned to play in June 2006 but does not bowl the doosra any more.

=== Johan Botha ===
South African Johan Botha has been reported for his version of the doosra after the 3rd Test match against Australia in January 2006. Botha was playing in his maiden test match at the time, taking 2 wickets. His bowling was later ruled illegal, and he was banned, though this ban was lifted in November 2006. However, in April 2009, he was called for a re-assessment of his bowling action after the series in Australia. In May 2009, he was allowed to bowl all types of deliveries except the doosra, which was deemed to exceed the 15-degree limit.

=== Saeed Ajmal ===
A Pakistani cricketer, Saeed Ajmal is an off-spin bowler who used the doosra as a mystery delivery by disguising it well. His technique was noted for causing more spin than speed, to his personal preference. In April 2009, Ajmal was reported by umpires for having a suspect bowling action. An independent test the following month, reaffirmed later by a subsequent thorough investigation by journalist George Dobell with extensive discussion with the ICC conducted and released in 2012, made clear that Ajmal&#x27;s bowling action falls well within the legal bounds set by the ICC for bowlers.
Ajmal also had a mystery delivery called teesra which he used against England&#x27;s Stuart Broad in test series at UAE in 2011–12. However, he was banned in September 2014 after his action was deemed illegal for all deliveries by the ICC as part of the clampdown on illegal actions. Although initially he hoped to make the 2015 Cricket World Cup he subsequently ruled himself out in December 2014 after deciding not to get his action retested by the ICC and although his ban was lifted in February 2015 did not feature in the showpiece event.

=== Shohag Gazi ===

The doosra of Bangladeshi bowler Shohag Gazi was very difficult for Indian batsmen to read and play in his first match against India. After that series Shohag Gazi was accused by the ICC of using an illegal bowling action. After changing his action under ICC rules, he became an ineffective bowler and was subsequently dropped from the national team.

== Teesra ==

In 2004, Saqlain Mushtaq, the developer of the doosra, said he had developed a new variant called the teesra, which is a backspinner disguised as an off spinner. He was supposed to have used it in ICL matches. A teesra is a slightly round-arm delivery, having more pace than either doosra or offspinner and can surprise a batsman. It can also have good effect in limited overs cricket for containing runs.

In 2011, Saeed Ajmal said he had learned the art of teesra and was looking to use this delivery in upcoming matches.

<doc id="560165" wikidata="Q882592" url="?curid=560165" title="Psilocybe cyanescens">
<text>Psilocybe cyanescens, commonly known as the wavy cap or potent psilocybe, is a species of potent psychedelic mushroom. The main compounds responsible for its psychedelic effects are psilocybin and psilocin. It belongs to the family Hymenogastraceae. A formal description of the species was published by Elsie Wakefield in 1946 in the &quot;Transactions of the British Mycological Society&quot;, based on a specimen she had recently collected at Kew Gardens. She had begun collecting the species as early as 1910. The mushroom is not generally regarded as being physically dangerous to adults. Since all the psychoactive compounds in &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; are water-soluble, the fruiting bodies can be rendered non-psychoactive through parboiling, allowing their culinary use. However, since most people find them overly bitter and they are too small to have great nutritive value, this is not frequently done.

&quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; can sometimes fruit in colossal quantities; more than 100,000 individual mushrooms were found growing in a single patch at a racetrack in England.

==Description==

===Appearance===
&quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; has a hygrophanous pileus (cap) that is caramel to chestnut-brown when moist, fading to pale buff or slightly yellowish when dried. Caps generally measure from 1.5–5 cm (½&quot; to 2&quot;) across, and are normally distinctly wavy in maturity. The color of the pileus is rarely seen in mushrooms outside of the &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; species complex. Most parts of the mushroom, including the cap and Lamellae (gills, underneath the cap) can stain blue when touched or otherwise disturbed, probably due to the oxidation of psilocin. The lamellae are adnate, and light brown to dark purple brown in maturity, with lighter gill edges. There is no distinct annulus, but immature &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; specimens do have a cobwebby veil which may leave an annular zone in maturity. Both the odor and taste are farinaceous.

&quot;P. cyanescens&quot; has elliptical spores which measure 9–12 x 5–8 μm. According to some authors, the holotype collection of the species from Kew Gardens featured no pleurocystidia, but North American collections are characterized by common clavate-mucronate pleurocystidia. However, pleurocystidia are present in the holotype collection (but not easily to observe since hymenium is collapsed). In European collections of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot;, pleurocystidia are common and their shape is identical to those known from the United States. In 2012, an epitype from Hamburg, Germany was designated.

Fresh sporocarps and mycelia of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; generally bruise blueish or blue-green where damaged, and the staining remains visible after drying. This staining is most noticeable on the stem (which is white when undisturbed) but can also occur on other parts of the mushroom, including the gills, cap, and mycelium. This staining is due primarily to the oxidation of psilocin. (Psilocybin cannot be oxidized directly, but is quickly converted via enzymatic action to psilocin at injury sites which can then be oxidized, so even specimens with little psilocin still generally stain blue.)

Other related species may include &quot;P. weraroa&quot;, and these relatives are collectively referred to as the &quot;&quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; complex&quot; or as the &quot;caramel-capped psilocybe complex,&quot; due to their extremely similar appearance and habit. There is phylogenetic evidence that there are two distinct clades in the complex, one consisting of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; and &quot;P. azurescens&quot; and allies, and the other consisting of &quot;P. serbica&quot; and allies (European taxa). It has also been shown that &quot;Psilocybe weraroa&quot; (previously known as &quot;Weraroa novae-zelandiae&quot;) is very closely related to &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; despite its vastly dissimilar appearance.

A very close relative of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; is &quot;Psilocybe allenii&quot; (described in 2012), formerly known as &quot;Psilocybe cyanofriscosa&quot;, a mushroom found in California and Washington It can be distinguished by macromorphological features and/or sequencing of rDNA ITS molecular marker.

It is often difficult or impossible to distinguish between members of the &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; complex except by range without resorting to microscopic or molecular characters.

Although not closely related, &quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; has been at least occasionally confused with &quot;Galerina marginata&quot; with fatal results. The two mushrooms have generally similar habits and appearances, and bear a superficial resemblance to each other such that inexperienced mushroom-seekers may confuse the two. The two species can grow side-by-side, which may add to the chance of confusion. The two mushrooms have different colored spores, making a spore print essential to proper identification.

==Habitat and distribution==

&quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; grows today primarily on wood chips, especially in and along the perimeter of mulched plant beds in urban areas, but can also grow on other lignin-rich substrates. &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; does not grow on substrate that is not lignin-rich. Fruitings have been reported in natural settings previously (although most appear to be migrations from mulched plant beds.) The species does not typically grow on mulch that is made from bark.

In the United States, &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; occurs mainly in the Pacific Northwest, stretching south to the San Francisco Bay Area. It can also be found in areas such as New Zealand, Western Europe, Central Europe, and parts of west Asia (Iran). The range in which &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; occurs is rapidly expanding, especially in areas where it is not native as the use of mulch to control weeds has been popularized. This rapid expansion of range may be due in part to the simple expedient of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; mycelium having colonized the distribution network of woodchip suppliers and thus being distributed on a large scale with commercial mulch. It has been documented to fruit in Spring on the East Coast of the United States.

Although it has been speculated that &quot;P. cyanescens&quot;&#x27; native habitat is the coniferous woodlands of the north-western United States or coastal dunes in the PNW, and the type specimen was described from mulch beds in Kew Gardens, the natural distribution of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; in the wild remains unknown.

Fruiting is dependent on a drop in temperature. In the San Francisco Bay Area, this means that fruiting typically occurs between late October and February, and fruiting in other areas generally occurs in fall, when temperatures are between .

&quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; often fruits gregariously or in cespitose clusters, sometimes in great numbers. 100,000 &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; fruits were once found growing on a racetrack in the south of England. Solitary fruits are sometimes also found.

==Indole content==
The fruits of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; have been shown to contain many different indole alkaloids including psilocybin, psilocin, and baeocystin. It has also been shown that &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; mycelium will contain detectable levels of psilocin and psilocybin, but only after the formation of primordia.

Indole content has been shown to be higher in North American specimens of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; than in European ones. This was, however, caused by the fact that Gartz did not analyze the genuine &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; but &quot;P. serbica&quot;.

North American fruiting bodies of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; have been shown to have between 0.66% and 1.96% total indole content by dry weight. European fruiting bodies have been shown to have between 0.39% and 0.75% total indole content by dry weight.

North American specimens of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; are among the most potent of psychedelic mushrooms. Its potency means that it is widely sought after by users of recreational drugs in those areas where it grows naturally.

==Cultivation==
Fruiting begins with simulation of a fall environment at temperatures between .

&quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot;, like many other psilocybin containing mushrooms, is sometimes cultivated. Due to the fruiting requirements of the species, it is challenging but possible to get &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; to produce fruits indoors. Outdoor cultivation in an appropriate climate is relatively easy. Yield per pound of substrate is low when compared to other psilocybin containing mushrooms for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. The combination of poor yield and difficulty may explain why &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; is grown less frequently than some other psilocybin containing mushrooms.

&quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; mycelium is easier to grow than actual fruits are, can be grown indoors, and is robust enough that it can be transplanted in order to start new patches. Mycelium can also be propagated via stem butt transplantation. Many of the cultivation techniques used with other members of the genus &quot;Psilocybe&quot; can be used to grow &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; as well. Cultivated &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; contain approximately the same concentration of psilocin and psilocybin as natural examples do.

==Legal status==
&quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; specimens do not fall under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances because the convention does not cover naturally occurring plants or fungi that incidentally contain a scheduled drug. However, many countries choose to prohibit possession of psilocybin containing mushrooms, including &quot;P. cyanescens&quot;, under their domestic laws. 

Countries that have banned or severely regulated the possession of &quot;P. cyanescens&quot; include the United States, Germany, New Zealand, and many others. Although this is difficult to enforce since no species of Psilocybe mushroom has spores containing psilocybin or psilocin. Because of this, &quot;Psilocybe cyanescens&quot; spores are not illegal to possess in many US states. (It is illegal to possess spores in Georgia and Idaho, and illegal to possess them with the intent to produce mushrooms in California.)

<text>Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm Freiherr von Lützow (18 May 17826 December 1834) was a Prussian general notable for his organization and command of the &quot;Lützow Freikorps&quot; of volunteers during the Napoleonic Wars.

==Early life==

Lützow was born in Berlin on 18 May 1782 as the son of Prussian Major General, Johann Adolph von Lützow (1748–1819), and his wife, Friederike Wilhelmine von Zastrow (1754 to 1815). He belonged to an old noble family from Mecklenburg.

== Biography ==
Lützow first entered the Prussian Army in 1795, and eleven years later as a lieutenant took part in the disastrous battle of Auerstadt. He then achieved distinction in the siege of Kolberg, as the leader of a squadron of Schill&#x27;s volunteers.

In 1808, as a major Lützow retired from the Prussian army, indignant at the humiliating treaty of Tilsit. He took part in the heroic venture of his old chief Schill in 1809; wounded at Dodendorf and left behind, he thereby escaped the fate of his comrades, many of whom were either killed at the Battle of Stralsund (1809) or were among the 12 officers executed at Napoleon&#x27;s command in the aftermath. In Schöneiche he was hidden by the owner of the village in a little hunters&#x27; hut at the village border and there Lützow was able to recover from his wounds. Today the newer building made of stone is called &quot;Lützowhaus&quot; (&quot;Lützow House&quot;) in commemoration of this episode.

==Lützow Free Corps==

In 1811, Lützow was recommissioned into the Prussian army as major, and at the outbreak of the German War of Liberation received permission from Scharnhorst to organize a free corps consisting of infantry, cavalry and Tirolese riflemen, for attacking flanks or in guerilla fighting in the French rear and rallying the smaller governments into the ranks of the allies. From their uniform, they were known as the &quot;Black Troopers&quot; or &quot;Black Riflemen&quot;.

The valor of the Black Troop is commemorated in Theodor Körner&#x27;s poem &quot;Lützows wilde, verwegene Jagd&quot; (&quot;Lützow&#x27;s wild, daring hunt&quot;). As Lützow&#x27;s adjutant, he met his death at the Battle of Gadebusch. Among other notable members of the corps were Friedrich Fröbel and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn. This incident was portrayed in the 1927 film &quot;Lützow&#x27;s Wild Hunt&quot; directed by Richard Oswald.

This corps played a marked part in the campaign of 1813. But Lützow was unable to coerce the minor states, and the wanderings of the corps had little military influence. At Kitzen (near Leipzig) the whole corps, warned too late of the armistice of Poischwitz, was caught on the French side of the line of demarcation, and, as a fighting force, annihilated. Lützow himself, wounded, cut his way out with the survivors, and immediately began reorganizing and recruiting.

In the second part of the campaign the corps Lützow served in more regular warfare under Wallmoden. Lützow and his men distinguished themselves at Gadebusch (where Körner fell) and Göhrde (where Lützow himself, for the second time, received a severe wound at the head of the cavalry). Sent next against Denmark, and later employed at the siege of Jülich, Lützow in 1814 fell into the hands of the French.

==Late career==

After the peace of 1814 the corps was dissolved, the infantry becoming the 25th Regiment, the cavalry the 6th Uhlans. At Ligny Lützow led the 6th Uhlans to the charge, but they were broken by the French cavalry, and he finally remained in the hands of the enemy, escaping the next day during the French defeat at the Waterloo. Made colonel in that year, his subsequent promotions were: major-general 1822, and lieutenant-general (on retirement) 1830.

Lützow died on 6 December 1834. One of the last acts of his life for which Lützow is remembered is his challenge (which was ignored) to Blücher (died in 1819), who had been ridden down in the rout of the 6th Ulans at the Battle of Ligny, and had made, in his official report, comments thereon, which their colonel considered disparaging.

==Legacy==
Several German warships including SMS &quot;Lützow&quot; of World War I, and the heavy cruiser &quot;Lützow&quot; (ex-&quot;Deutschland&quot;) of World War II, were named after him.

The 37th SS Volunteer Cavalry Division Lützow was also named after him.

Democratic Germany&#x27;s national colours Black, Red and Gold originate from the iconic Lützower&#x27;s black uniforms, which showed red insignia and golden buttons.

<doc id="560171" wikidata="Q72343" url="?curid=560171" title="Ferdinand von Schill">
<text>Major Ferdinand Baptista von Schill (6 January 1776 – 31 May 1809) was a Prussian Army officer who revolted unsuccessfully against France&#x27;s domination of Prussia in May 1809. Schill&#x27;s rebellion ended at the Battle of Stralsund, a battle which also saw Schill&#x27;s own death in action. Outnumbered 3 to 1, Schill&#x27;s Prussian forces succumbed to a Napoleonic force supported by Dutch and Danish auxiliaries.

==Life==

Schill was born at Wilmsdorf (now a part of Bannewitz, Saxony) and entered the Prussian Army&#x27;s cavalry at the age of twelve or fourteen (sources differ). His father, Johann-Georg Schill, had been an ambitious commoner from Bohemia, who attained the aristocratic &quot;von&quot; for his services to Austria and Saxony during the Seven Years&#x27; War. J.-G. von Schill had raised a &quot;Freikorps&quot;, a small raiding party of cavalry and mounted infantry, operating behind enemy lines, and acquired some measure of fame and success. Many of Ferdinand von Schill&#x27;s later biographers assumed that his father&#x27;s example was an important influence on his subsequent career.

Ferdinand von Schill was a second-lieutenant in the Prussian 5th &quot;Bayreuth&quot; dragoons, re-designated the Queen&#x27;s Dragoons in 1806, in honor of the popular Queen Louise. When Prussia and France went to war in October of 1806, he was wounded at the battle of Auerstadt. From that field he escaped to Kolberg, where he played a very prominent part in the celebrated siege of 1806–07, as the commander of a Freikorps, raiding behind the French lines. After the Treaty of Tilsit, he was promoted to major, awarded the Pour le Mérite, and given the command of a hussar regiment formed primarily from his Kolberg men.

==Schill&#x27;s revolution==

In 1809 the political situation in Europe appeared to Schill to favor an attempt to liberate Germany from the French domination of Napoleon Bonaparte. He was an active member of the Tugendbund, the quasi-Masonic &quot;League of Virtue&quot; founded in June 1808, and including many notable Prussian reformers such as Gerhard von Scharnhorst and August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. It was banned in 1809. Many Tugendbund leaders believed that the new Kingdom of Westphalia, created by Napoleon from many smaller German states, and ruled by Napoleon&#x27;s youngest brother Jérôme Bonaparte, was ripe for revolution. Schill planned to create an uprising in Westphalia that would topple the Bonaparte regime there, and – coupled with the efforts of Austria, Spain, and Britain – would bring about the fall of Napoleonic dominance in Germany.

Leading out his regiment from Berlin under pretext of manoeuvres, he raised the standard of revolt, and, joined by many officers and a company of light infantry, marched first south through Saxony, and then north-west into Westphalia. At the village of Dodendorf on 5 May 1809, he had a brush with the Magdeburg garrison and won a small victory. Schill had no difficulty defeating, or even recruiting, the unreliable Westphalian troops sent against him, and his rebellion swelled to over 2,000 men.

He had less success, however, with the gathering Danish and Dutch forces, which gradually drove him in a north-east direction toward the Baltic Sea. His most serious difficulty was the condemnation of Prussia&#x27;s king Frederick William III, who feared that the revolt would drag a weakened and unprepared Prussia into another disastrous war against Napoleon. By the end of May, although he had left garrisons and raiding parties in various places, Schill&#x27;s main force was trapped at Stralsund. He had between 1,500 and 2,000 men, against a force of 8,000 Danish and Dutch troops under French command.


===Liberation fails===

On 31 May the Napoleonic forces stormed Stralsund. Schill was killed in the street fighting as his defenses collapsed. Over a thousand of his rebels escaped to Prussia, overland or by ship, where the officers were tried by court-martial, cashiered and imprisoned (although all were subsequently pardoned). Some smaller parties of rebels including his two brothers escaped to Sweden, and ultimately Austria and Britain, but the rest were either killed or taken. The French commander counted 570 prisoners, the majority of whom were then sent to the galleys. About 100 rebels who had been Westphalian deserters were separated and taken to Brunswick, where 14 of them were ultimately executed.

Schill&#x27;s body was decapitated. The corpse was dumped in an unmarked grave in Stralsund. The head was sent to Jerome Bonaparte as a trophy, but he gave it to a Dutch surgeon who collected oddities, and it remained at the University of Leiden until 1837, when German patriots obtained it for the dedication of a Schill monument in Brunswick.

===Schill&#x27;s Eleven Officers===
Eleven of Schill&#x27;s officers were taken as a group to several different cities before their fate was sealed by Napoleon&#x27;s orders. Eventually they were taken to the fortress of Wesel where they were given a show trial and executed on 16 September. The young group became tragic heroes and martyrs, and their appearance brought out crowds in every German-speaking town and city they went through. A dramatic letter-writing campaign led by Philippine von Griesheim, the fiancé of one of the eleven officers, Albrecht von Wedell, and appeals to the Prussian King Frederick William III by the eleven asking to die by a Prussian firing squad instead of at the &#x27;hands of the enemy&#x27; helped create a legend that would become part of the propaganda encouraging the German liberation movement of 1813 leading to Prussia&#x27;s restoration of independence.

One other close comrade of Schill&#x27;s escaped execution and became known as &#x27;The Twelfth&#x27;. Lieutenant Heinrich von Wedell had served with Schill as far back as the Siege of Kolberg. He was badly wounded at the battle of Dodendort and had to remain behind there. He was captured and interrogated by the French. Heinrich managed to convince the French that he had participated against his will and so he was sent to France, physically branded a criminal, and served eight months on a prison ship and then hard labor in a prison quarry before eventually being released in early 1812 in anticipation of the impending war with Russia. He was the cousin of Carl and Albrecht von Wedell who were among the eleven Schill officers executed at Wesel.

Another of Schill&#x27;s officers, the Swede Friedrich-Gustave Peterson was executed by firing squad in Stralsund.

==Legacy==
By the 1830s Schill was widely considered a hero throughout Germany. Monuments and historical markers to him or to his rebels have been erected in towns and cities: Wesel, Stralsund, Braunschweig, Wilmersdorf, Potsdam, Ohlau, Cottbus, Anklam, Geldern, and Wittenberg.

Military units were named after him (most notably the last division fielded by the Wehrmacht during World War II, the Infantry Division Ferdinand von Schill of late April 1945), streets and plazas bear his name to this day. Over 400 biographies, novels, plays, operas, and collections of poetry have been published about him in German, and he is featured in over a dozen German films including Rudolf Meinert&#x27;s 1926 silent film &quot;The Eleven Schill Officers&quot; and his 1932 sound remake.

<text>Sillamäe (Estonian for &#x27;Bridge Hill&#x27;; also known by the Germanised names of &quot;Sillamäggi&quot; or &quot;Sillamägi&quot;) is a town in Ida-Viru County in the northereastern part of Estonia, on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland. It has a population of 12,439 (as of 2021) and covers an area of 10.54 km2. Sillamäe is located at the mouth of Sõtke River. Its population is predominantly Russian-speaking.

==History==
The locality of Sillamäggi was first mentioned in 1502 when the area was under the control of the Livonian Order. The bridge across the Sõtke River and a mill in Sillamäggi were documented in 1700.

In the 1800s, Sillamäggi developed into a resort village offering a more tranquil experience than the nearby resort town of Hungerburg. The Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov owned a dacha in Sillamäggi and vacationed there during summer breaks from 1891 to 1917. Among other famous vacationers of Sillamäggi were the poet Konstantin Balmont (1905), painter Albert Benois (1898 and 1899), physicist Paul Ehrenfest (1908–1912), botanist Andrei Famintsyn (1890s), historian Mikhail Gershenzon (1911–1914), inventor Boris Rosing (1902–1911), and composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1868).

In the 1920s and 1930s, Sillamäe and the surrounding countryside saw the rise of the oil shale mining industry in the area. From 1927 to 1929, the Swedish company &quot;Estländska Oljeskifferkonsortiet&quot; built an oil shale processing plant and a power station at the location of Türsamäe Manor, on the western side of Sillamäe. This plant reached a total capacity of 500 tonnes per day in the mid-1930s. A small harbour was constructed in Sillamäe to support the plant&#x27;s activities, but it was destroyed during World War II.

During the Nazi occupation, several concentration camps were established in the vicinity of Sillamäe to employ slave laborers in the local mines. Upon withdrawal from Sillamäe in 1944, German forces sabotaged the processing plant. The German defensive positions on the hills east of Sillamäe, known as Sinimäed, formed the Tannenberg Line during the Battle of Narva.
In 1946–1948, the former oil shale processing plant in Sillamäe was rebuilt by Soviets to extract uranium oxide from the locally mined graptolitic argillite ore (a type of oil shale). During that time, many war prisoners were employed at the construction and mining activities in Sillamäe. The uranium extraction process at the Sillamäe plant was developed in collaboration with a nearby Narva pilot plant (known as Cloth Dyeing Factory) and produced mainly a 40% uranium concentrate at the onset of plant production. The local mining operations continued until 1952. In the following years, richer uranium ores were imported to the Sillamäe plant from various locations of Central Asia and the Eastern Bloc, mainly from mines in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania including the Bihor mine operated by Sovromcuarţ (one of the SovRoms operated jointly by the Soviet Union and Romania). In 1970, the plant started to process loparite ore from the Kola Peninsula producing tantalum and niobium chemicals. Later, it also started to extract rare earth metal oxides. In 1982, the plant began the production of reactor-grade enriched uranium (2–4.4% 235U) in form of UO2. Uranium production at Sillamäe continued to supply nuclear materials for the Soviet nuclear power plants and weapon facilities until 1989. From 1950 to 1989, the plant produced about 98,681 tonnes of uranium (mostly as U3O8) and 1354.7 tonnes of enriched uranium.

During its operations, the Sillamäe plant dumped the processing wastes into a tailing pond at the north-western part of Sillamäe near the Baltic Sea shoreline. By the 1990s, the pond presented a serious ecological hazard due to leaching of radioactive and other harmful particulates and dissolved materials into the Baltic Sea. In the 2000s, measures were undertaken to secure the containment of the wastes at Sillamäe.

In 1957, Sillamäe officially gained town status. By that time, it had already grown beyond the historical boundaries of Sillamäggi and included several neighboring settlements, such as Kannuka and Türsamäe. During the Soviet regime in Estonia, Sillamäe remained a closed town due to the secrecy and security measures related to the uranium production activities at the local plant.

== Demographics ==

==Economy==

After uranium processing ceased in 1989 and Estonia regained independence in 1991, industrial activity at Sillamäe experienced significant decline throughout the 1990s resulting in a high unemployment rate among the local population. The Sillamäe plant was privatized in 1997 to form AS Silmet and continues to produce rare metal and rare earth metal products. It remains the top world producer of niobium and tantalum products including hydroxides, oxides, various grades of metal, metal hydrides, metal powders and NbNi alloy. Among rare earth element products are lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium and samarium-europium-gadolinium carbonates, oxides, metals, chloride and nitrate solutions.

On 4 April 2011, the American rare earth metal producer Molycorp announced its acquisition of a 90% stake in AS Silmet. The deal was valued at $89 million at the time. The company was renamed AS Silmet-Molycorp.

In 2005, a deep-sea port (SILPORT) with facilities able to handle dry bulk, liquid fertilizers and oil was opened in Sillamäe. A regular ferry service between Sillamäe and Kotka, Finland was inaugurated in 2006, but was forced to shut down in 2007 due to a low load factor. However, the cargo operations continue to show a steady growth. In 2011, the Sillamäe port reached 4.9 million metric tonnes in cargo traffic taking fifth place among the largest ports in the Baltic states after Tallinn, Riga, Klaipeda and Ventspils.

There are several seaside resorts located in the vicinity of Sillamäe (Toila and Narva-Jõesuu) that were especially popular during the Soviet era.
